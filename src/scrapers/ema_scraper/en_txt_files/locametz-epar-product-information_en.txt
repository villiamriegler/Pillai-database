Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years and above. 
Renal impairment 
There are no data with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide in patients with moderate to severe/end-stage renal 
impairment. No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Locametz in the paediatric population for the identification of 
PSMA-positive lesions in prostate cancer. 
Method of administration 
This medicinal product is for intravenous and multidose use. It should be reconstituted and 
radiolabelled before administration to the patient. 
After reconstitution and radiolabelling, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution should be administered by 
slow intravenous injection. Local extravasation resulting in inadvertent radiation exposure to the 
patient and imaging artefacts should be avoided. The injection should be followed by an intravenous 
flush of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full delivery of the 
dose. 
The total radioactivity in the syringe should be verified with a dose calibrator immediately before and 
after administration to the patient. The dose calibrator must be calibrated and comply with 
international standards. Instructions regarding the dilution of the gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution 
should be followed (see section 12). 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4. 
For instructions on reconstitution and radiolabelling of the medicinal product before administration, 
see section 12. 
Image acquisition 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET image acquisition should be performed by scanning the whole body 
starting at mid-thigh and proceeding to skull base. PET images should be acquired 50 to 100 minutes 
after the intravenous administration of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution. 
Image acquisition start time and duration should be adapted to the equipment used, the patient and the 
tumour characteristics, in order to obtain the best image quality possible. 
Use of computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for attenuation correction is 
recommended. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any of the 
components of the labelled radiopharmaceutical.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity 
administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required diagnostic 
information. 
To date no outcome data exist to inform subsequent management of patients with high-risk disease 
when PSMA PET/CT is utilised for primary staging. 
Experience of use of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET for selection of patients for PSMA-based therapy 
is limited to patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who 
have been treated with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy, 
and to selection of patients for treatment with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. Benefit-risk ratio 
may not be generalisable to other types of PSMA-based therapy and patients with mCRPC with 
different prior treatments. 
Radiation risk 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide contributes to the patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure, 
which is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Safe handling, reconstitution and radiolabelling 
procedures should be ensured to protect patients and healthcare professionals from unintentional 
radiation exposure (see sections 6.6 and 12). 
Interpretation of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide images 
PET images with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide should be interpreted by visual assessment. Suspicion of 
malignant lesions is based on gallium (68Ga) gozetotide uptake in comparison with tissue background. 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide uptake is not specific to prostate cancer and may occur in normal tissues 
(see section 5.2), other types of cancers and non-malignant processes, potentially leading to false 
positive findings. Moderate to high physiological PSMA uptake is noted in the kidneys, lacrimal 
glands, liver, salivary glands and urinary bladder wall. False positive findings include, but are not 
limited to, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, benign bone 
diseases (e.g. Paget’s disease), pulmonary sarcoidosis/granulomatosis, gliomas, meningiomas, 
paragangliomas and neurofibromas. Ganglia can mimic lymph nodes. 
The diagnostic performance of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide may be affected by serum PSA levels, 
androgen-receptor-targeting treatments, disease stage and size of malignant lymph nodes (see 
section 5.1). 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET images should be interpreted only by readers trained in the 
interpretation of PET images with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET. Findings on gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide PET images should always be interpreted in conjunction with and be confirmed by other 
diagnostic methods (including histopathology) before subsequent change in patient management is 
initiated. 
Patient preparation 
Patients should be well hydrated prior to gallium (68Ga) gozetotide administration and should be 
advised to void immediately prior to and frequently during the first hours after image acquisition in 
order to reduce radiation exposure.

Specific warnings 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains 28.97 mg sodium per injection, equivalent to 1.5% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Acidic pH and extravasation 
Low pH of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide may lead to injection site reactions after administration. 
Accidental extravasation may cause local irritation, due to the acidic pH of the solution. Cases of 
extravasation should be managed as per institutional guidelines. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on in vitro interaction studies, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is not expected to have any clinically 
significant interaction with other medicinal products (see section 5.2). No interaction studies have 
been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Locametz is not indicated for use in females. There are no data on the use of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide 
in females. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals have not been conducted with gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide. However, all radiopharmaceuticals, including gallium (68Ga) gozetotide, have the potential 
to cause foetal harm. 
Breast-feeding 
Locametz is not indicated for use in females. There are no data on the effects of gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk production. Lactation studies have not been 
conducted in animals with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. As the effective dose is 0.0166 mSv/MBq, with a maximal recommended dose of 
259 MBq (4.3 mSv), these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a low probability. 
Mild to moderate adverse reactions occurred in patients receiving gallium (68Ga) gozetotide, with the 
exception of a grade 3 fatigue event (0.1%). 
The most common adverse reactions are fatigue (1.2%), nausea (0.8%), constipation (0.5%) and 
vomiting (0.5%).

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide at median dose per body weight of 1.9 MBq/kg (range: 
0.9-3.7 MBq/kg) was evaluated in 1 003 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
receiving physician’s discretion for best standard of care (VISION study). 
Adverse reactions (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ 
class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within 
each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In 
addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following 
convention (CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide, the radiation 
absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the 
radionuclide from the body by hydration and frequent bladder voiding. It might be helpful to estimate 
the effective radiation dose that was applied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals 
for tumour detection, ATC code: V09IX14 
Mechanism of action 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide binds to cells that express PSMA, including malignant prostate cancer cells, 
which overexpress PSMA. Gallium-68 is a radionuclide with an emission yield that allows PET 
imaging. Based on the intensity of the signals, PET images obtained with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide 
indicate the presence of PSMA protein in tissues. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide does not 
have any pharmacodynamic activity. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The sensitivity and specificity of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide were evaluated in the two following 
prospective studies: 
In van Kalmthout et al, 2020, 103 adult male patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and 
intermediate- and high-risk features indicated for extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) 
underwent gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT imaging. PET/CT scans were read by two independent 
blinded readers and ePLND was the histopathology reference standard for 96 out of 103 (93%) 
patients. Patient-based sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV, 
respectively) of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT imaging to detect lymph node metastasis (LNM) 
are summarised in Table 2.

Inter-reader agreement was κ = 0.67 for the 2 independent blinded readers. Of the 67 LNM analysed, 
26 were detected by gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT, resulting in 38.8% node-based sensitivity. 
Median diameter of the metastatic deposit in these detected LNM was 7 mm (range: 0.3-35). The PET 
reading missed 41 LNM with a median metastatic deposit of 3.0 mm (range: 0.5 to 35.0). 
In Fendler et al, 2019, 635 adult male patients with histopathology-proven and biochemical recurrence 
(BCR) prostate cancer after prostatectomy (N=262), radiation therapy (N=169) or both (N=204) 
underwent gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT or PET/MRI imaging. BCR was defined by serum PSA 
of ≥0.2 ng/mL more than 6 weeks after prostatectomy or by an increase in serum PSA of at least 
2 ng/mL above nadir after definitive radiotherapy. Patients had median PSA level of 2.1 ng/mL above 
nadir after radiation therapy (range: 0.1-1 154 ng/mL). A composite reference standard, including 
histopathology, serial serum PSA levels and imaging (CT, MRI, and/or bone scan) findings was 
available for 223 of 635 (35.1%) patients, while histopathology reference standard alone was available 
for 93 (14.6%) patients. PET/CT scans were read by 3 independent readers blinded to clinical 
information other than the type of primary therapy and most recent serum PSA level. 
Detection of PSMA-positive lesions occurred in 475 of 635 (75%) patients receiving gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide and the detection rate was significantly increased with PSA levels. The detection rate of 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET positive lesion increased with increasing serum PSA levels (see 
section 4.4). Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT 
imaging are summarised in Table 3. Inter-reader Fleiss κ for gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT 
imaging ranged from 0.65 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.70) to 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.82) across the assessed 
regions (prostate bed, pelvic nodes, extrapelvic soft tissues and bones).

Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT imaging was used to identify adult patients with progressive, 
PSMA-positive mCRPC cancer for the randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase III study VISION, 
which tested efficacy of Pluvicto plus best standard of care or best standard of care alone. A total of 
1 003 male patients, who had been treated with at least one androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitor 
and 1 or 2 prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimens, were selected based on the PSMA expression 
of their prostate cancer lesions. Patients underwent a gallium (68Ga) gozetotide PET/CT scan to 
evaluate PSMA expression in lesions defined by central read criteria. Improved overall survival and 
radiographic progression-free survival were reported in the PSMA-targeted therapy arm. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Locametz in all subsets of the paediatric population for visualisation of PSMA in prostate cancer (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide exhibits bi-exponential behaviour in blood, with a biological half-life of 
6.5 minutes for the fast component and a terminal half-life of 4.4 hours for the slower component. 
Based on in vitro data, gozetotide mainly distributes to plasma, with a mean blood-to-plasma ratio of 
0.71. Gozetotide is 33% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Organ uptake 
The highest radiation absorbed dose of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide occurred in the kidneys, lacrimal 
glands, salivary glands, urinary bladder wall and liver. 
The estimated radiation absorbed doses to these organs for an administered activity of 259 MBq are 
62.1 mGy (kidneys), 28.5 mGy (lacrimal glands), 23.1 mGy (salivary glands), 14.8 mGy (urinary 
bladder wall) and 13.7 mGy (liver). 
Biotransformation 
Based on in vitro data, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide undergoes negligible hepatic and renal metabolism. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is mainly eliminated via the renal route. Approximately 14% of the gallium 
(68Ga) gozetotide dose administered is excreted in the urine after 2 hours post-injection. 
Half-life 
Based on the gallium (68Ga) gozetotide biological and terminal half-life of 4.4 hours and on the 
gallium-68 physical half-life of 68 minutes, the resulting gallium (68Ga) gozetotide effective half-life is 
54 minutes. 
In vitro evaluation of drug interaction potential 
CYP450 enzymes 
Gozetotide is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Gallium 
(68Ga) gozetotide is not expected to have any drug interactions with CYP450 substrates, inhibitors or 
inducers. 
Transporters 
Gozetotide is not a substrate of BCRP, P-gp, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2. Gozetotide 
is not an inhibitor of BCRP, BSEP, P-gp, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OCT1 or OCT2. Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is not expected to have any drug interactions with the 
substrates of these transporters. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In the VISION clinical study, 752 of 1 003 (75%) patients were aged 65 years or older. No overall 
differences in safety and efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. 
Renal impairment / hepatic impairment 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide pharmacokinetics and biodistribution are not expected to be affected by 
renal/hepatic impairment to any clinically relevant extent. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Gozetotide was evaluated in safety pharmacology and single-dose toxicity studies. Non-clinical data 
reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and 
single-dose toxicity. 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Mutagenicity studies and carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with gallium (68Ga) 
gozetotide.

11.  DOSIMETRY 
Gallium-68 is produced by means of a germanium-68/gallium-68 (68Ge/68Ga) generator and decays 
with a half-life of 68 min to stable zinc-68. Gallium-68 decays as follows: 
• 
89% through positron emission with a mean energy of 836 keV, followed by photonic 
annihilation radiations of 511 keV (178%). 
10% through orbital electron capture (X-ray or Auger emissions), and 
3% through 13 gamma transitions from 5 excited levels. 
• 
• 
The effective radiation dose of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide is 0.022 mSv/MBq, resulting in an 
approximate effective radiation dose of 5.70 mSv for an administered maximum activity of 259 MBq. 
Median radiation absorbed doses for organs and tissues of adult patients (N=6) following intravenous 
injection of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide including observed ranges were calculated by Sandgren et al, 
2019, using ICRP/ICRU voxel phantom with the software IDAC-Dose 2.1. Median radiation absorbed 
doses of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide are shown in Table 4.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
Method of preparation 
Step 1: Reconstitution and radiolabelling 
Locametz allows the direct preparation of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection with the 
eluate from one of the following generators (see below for specific instructions for use with each 
generator): 
• 
• 
Eckert & Ziegler GalliaPharm germanium-68/gallium-68 (68Ge/68Ga) generator 
IRE ELiT Galli Ad germanium-68/gallium-68 (68Ge/68Ga) generator 
The instructions for use provided by the germanium-68/gallium-68 generator manufacturer should also 
be followed. 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection should be prepared according to the following aseptic 
procedure: 
a. 
Flip the cap off the Locametz vial and swab the septum with an appropriate antiseptic, then 
allow the septum to dry. 
Pierce the Locametz vial septum with a sterile needle connected to a 0.2 micron sterile air 
venting filter to maintain atmospheric pressure within the vial during the reconstitution process. 
Place the Locametz vial in a lead shield container. 
b. 
Follow the generator-specific reconstitution and radiolabelling procedures as shown in Table 5 and in 
Figures 1 and 2. Then continue with Step 2. 
Table 5 
Reconstitution and radiolabelling with Eckert & Ziegler GalliaPharm and IRE 
ELiT Galli Ad generators 
If IRE ELiT Galli Ad generator is used 
If Eckert & Ziegler GalliaPharm generator is 
used 
• 
• 
Connect the male luer of the outlet line of the generator to a sterile elution needle 
(size 21G-23G). 
Connect the Locametz vial directly to the outlet line of the generator by pushing the elution 
needle through the rubber septum. 
Elute directly from the generator into the Locametz vial. 
• 
Perform the elution manually or by means of a 
pump according to the generator instructions for 
use. 
Connect the Locametz vial through the vent 
needle with 0.2 micron sterile air venting filter 
to a vacuum vial (25 mL minimum volume) by 
means of a sterile needle (size 21G-23G) or to a 
pump to start the elution. 
Reconstitute the lyophilised powder with 1.1 mL 
of eluate. 
At the end of the elution, first withdraw the 
sterile needle from the vacuum vial or 
disconnect the vacuum pump in order to 
establish atmospheric pressure into the 
Locametz vial, then disconnect the vial from the 
generator by removing both the elution needle 
and the vent needle with the 0.2 micron sterile 
air venting filter needle from the rubber septum. 
Reconstitute the lyophilised powder with 5 mL 
of eluate. 
At the end of the elution, disconnect the 
Locametz vial from the generator by removing 
the elution needle and the vent needle with the 
0.2 micron sterile air venting filter from the 
rubber septum. Then, invert the Locametz vial 
once and place it upright.

Step 2: Incubation 
a. 
Incubate the Locametz vial upright at room temperature (20-30°C) for at least 5 minutes without 
agitation or stirring. 
After 5 minutes, assay the vial containing the gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection for 
total radioactivity concentration using a dose calibrator and record the result. 
Perform quality controls according to the recommended methods in order to check compliance 
with the specifications (see Step 3). 
Store the Locametz vial containing the gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection upright 
in a lead shield container below 30°C until use. 
After addition of gallium-68 chloride to the Locametz vial, use gallium (68Ga) gozetotide 
solution for injection within 6 hours.

Method 
Visual inspection 
pH-indicator strips 
Instant thin layer chromatography 
(ITLC, see details below) 
Determine labelling efficiency of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection by performing 
instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC). 
Perform ITLC using ITLC SG strips and using ammonium acetate 1M: Methanol (1:1 V/V) as mobile 
phase. 
ITLC method 
a. 
Develop the ITLC SG strip for a distance of 6 cm from the point of application (i.e. to 7 cm 
from the bottom of the ITLC strip). 
Scan the ITLC SG strip with a radiometric ITLC scanner. 
Calculate labelling efficiency by integration of the peaks on the chromatogram. Do not use the 
reconstituted and radiolabelled product if the percentage (%) of non-complexed gallium-68 
species is higher than 3%. 
The retention factor (Rf) specifications are as follows: 
• 
• 
Non-complexed gallium-68 species, Rf = 0 to 0.2; 
Gallium (68Ga) gozetotide, Rf = 0.8 to 1 
Step 4: Administration 
a. 
Aseptic technique and radiation shielding should be used when withdrawing and administering 
gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). 
Prior to use, visually inspect the prepared gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection behind 
a lead glass shield for radioprotection purposes. Only solutions that are clear, colourless and 
without undissolved matter should be used (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). 
After reconstitution and radiolabelling, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection can be 
diluted with water for injections or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion up to 
a final volume of 10 mL. For the IRE ELiT Galli Ad generator, dilution to a minimum volume 
of 4 mL is required in order to reduce osmolality. 
Using a single-dose syringe fitted with a sterile needle (size 21G-23G) and protective shielding, 
aseptically withdraw the prepared gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution for injection prior to 
administration (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). 
The total radioactivity in the syringe should be verified with a dose calibrator immediately 
before and after gallium (68Ga) gozetotide administration to the patient. The dose calibrator 
must be calibrated and comply with international standards (see section 4.2).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Locametz is and what it is used for 
What Locametz is 
This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. 
Locametz contains a substance called gozetotide. Before use, gozetotide (the powder in the vial) is 
coupled with a radioactive substance called gallium-68 to make gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution 
(this procedure is called radiolabelling). 
What Locametz is used for 
After radiolabelling with gallium-68, Locametz is used in a medical imaging procedure called positron 
emission tomography (PET) to detect specific types of cancer cells with a protein called 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in adults with prostate cancer. This is done: 
- 
to find out whether prostate cancer has spread to lymph nodes and other tissues outside the 
prostate, before primary curative therapy (e.g. therapy involving surgical removal of the 
prostate, radiation therapy) 
to identify cancer cells when recurrence of prostate cancer is suspected in patients who have 
received primary curative therapy 
to find out whether patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer may 
be suitable for a specific therapy, called PSMA-targeted therapy 
- 
- 
How Locametz works 
When given to the patient, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide binds to the cancer cells that have PSMA on their 
surface and makes them visible to your nuclear medicine doctor during the PET medical imaging 
procedure. This gives your doctor and nuclear medicine doctor valuable information about your 
disease. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The use of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide involves exposure to a small amount of radioactivity. Your 
doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain 
from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. 
If you have any questions about how Locametz works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your nuclear medicine doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before Locametz is used 
Locametz must not be used 
- 
if you are allergic to gozetotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you receive Locametz if you have any other type of 
cancer, as this could affect the interpretation of the image. 
The use of Locametz involves exposure to a small amount of radioactivity. Repeated exposure to 
radiation may increase the risk of cancer. Your nuclear medicine doctor will explain necessary 
radioprotection measures to you (see section 3). 
Before administration of Locametz you should 
- 
Drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate immediately before the PET 
medical imaging procedure, and as often as possible during the first hours after administration. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children or adolescents aged under 18 years because no data are 
available in this age group. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Locametz is not intended for use in women. All radiopharmaceuticals, including Locametz, have the 
potential to cause harm to an unborn baby. 
Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Locametz will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
Locametz contains sodium 
This medicine contains 28.97 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each injection. 
This is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How Locametz is used 
There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Locametz will 
only be used in special controlled areas. This radiopharmaceutical product will only be handled and 
given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special 
care for the safe use of this radiopharmaceutical product and will keep you informed of their actions. 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Locametz to be 
used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. 
The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 1.8-2.2 MBq (megabecquerel, 
the unit used to express radioactivity) per kg of body weight, with a minimum amount of 111 MBq 
and a maximum of 259 MBq. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of Locametz and conduct of the procedure 
After reconstitution and radiolabelling, Locametz is given as a slow injection into a vein. You will 
undergo a PET scan starting 50 to 100 minutes after you have received Locametz. 
Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. 
After administration of Locametz, you should 
- 
Continue to drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate as often as possible to 
eliminate the radiopharmaceutical product from your body. 
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. 
If you have been given more Locametz than you should 
An overdose of Locametz is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose that is precisely 
controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the event of an 
overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. You may be asked to drink and urinate frequently 
in order to eliminate the radiopharmaceutical product from your body. 
Should you have any further question on the use of Locametz, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. 
4.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Coagadex is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes and for perioperative 
management in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency.  
Coagadex is indicated in all age groups 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of rare 
bleeding disorders. 
Posology 
The dose and duration of the treatment depend on the severity of the factor X deficiency (i.e. the patient’s 
baseline  factor  X  level),  on  the  location  and  extent of  the  bleeding  and  on  the patient’s  clinical condition. 
Careful control of replacement therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or life-threatening 
bleeding episodes. 
Not more than 60 IU/kg daily should be administered in any age group.

In adults and adolescents at least 12 years of age, the expected in vivo peak increase in factor X level expressed 
as IU/dL (or % of normal) can be estimated using the following formulae: 
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor X rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.5  
OR 
Increase in factor X level (IU/dL or % of normal) = [total dose (IU)/body weight (kg)] x 2  
The following examples assume the patient’s baseline factor X level is <1 IU/dL: 
1. 
2. 
A dose of 2000 IU Coagadex administered to a 70 kg patient should be expected to result in a peak post-
infusion factor X increase of 2000 x {[2 IU/dL]/[IU/kg]}/[70 kg] = 57 IU/dL (i.e. 57% of normal) 
A peak factor X level of 90% of normal is required in a 70 kg patient. In this situation, the appropriate 
dose would be: 
70 kg x 90 IU/dL/{[2 IU/dL]/[IU/kg]} = 3150 IU. 
The  dose  and  frequency  should  be  based  on  the  individual  clinical  response.  Patients  may  vary  in  their 
pharmacokinetic (e.g. half-life, in vivo recovery) and clinical responses to Coagadex. Although the dose can 
be estimated using the calculations above, whenever possible appropriate laboratory tests, such as serial factor 
X assays, should be performed to guide dose adjustments. 
Control of bleeding episodes 
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years or more for treatment of bleeding episodes: 25 IU/kg Coagadex should 
be injected when the first sign of bleeding occurs or just before the expected onset of menstrual bleeding. 
Repeat at intervals of 24 hours until the bleed stops. Each individual bleed should be judged on its own severity.   
For secondary prophylaxis against re-bleeding or short-term prophylaxis prior to anticipated physical activity 
or dental appointments: 25 IU/kg Coagadex should be injected and repeated as required. 
Routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes 
Due to inter-and intra-patient variability, it is recommended that trough blood levels of Factor X should be 
monitored at intervals, especially in the first weeks of therapy or after dose changes. Dose regimen should be 
adjusted to clinical response and trough levels of Factor X of at least 5 IU/dL.  
There are limited data on the use of Coagadex for long periods of prophylaxis in adults. There are no data 
available on routine prophylaxis in paediatric patients aged >12 to <18 years. 25 IU/kg twice weekly is the 
proposed starting dose for prophylaxis in patients >12 years of age with dose levels and dosing intervals to 
be adjusted as clinically indicated. Depending on individual clinical response, longer intervals, e.g. once 
weekly, might be adequate (see section 5.1). 
Perioperative Management (Adults and adolescents aged at least 12 years of age) 
Pre-surgery: calculate dose of Coagadex to raise plasma factor X levels to 70-90 IU/dL. The careful control 
of dose and duration of treatment is especially important in cases of major surgery. 
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor X rise (IU/dL) x 0.5 
The desired factor X rise is the difference between the patient’s plasma factor X level and the desired level, 
and based on the observed recovery of 2 IU/dL per IU/kg. 
Example:  to raise plasma factor X level from 15 IU/dL to 90 IU/dL in a 70 kg patient, the appropriate dose is:  
Post-surgery: dose as necessary to maintain plasma factor X levels at a minimum of 50 IU/dL until the 
subject is no longer at risk of bleeding due to surgery.  
70 x (90-15) x 0.5 = 2,625 IU. 
3 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is recommended that post-infusion plasma factor X levels are measured for each patient before and after 
surgery, to ensure that haemostatic levels are obtained and maintained. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Paediatric population 
For on-demand control of bleeding in children aged less than 12 years: 30 IU/kg Coagadex should be 
injected when the first sign of bleeding occurs. Repeat at intervals of 24 hours until the bleed stops. Each 
individual bleed should be judged on its own severity.   
For secondary prophylaxis against re-bleeding or short-term prophylaxis prior to anticipated physical activity 
or dental appointments: 30 IU/kg Coagadex should be injected and repeated as required. 
For routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in children aged less than 12 years: 40 IU/kg twice weekly. 
Due to inter-and intra-patient variability, it is recommended that trough blood levels of Factor X should be 
monitored at intervals, especially in the first weeks of therapy or after dose changes. Dose regimen should be 
adjusted to clinical response and trough levels of Factor X of at least 5 IU/dL. Some patients may achieve 
desired FX trough levels on once weekly prophylactic therapy (see section 5.1). 
For perioperative management in children aged less than 12 years: Pre-surgery: calculate dose of 
Coagadex to raise plasma factor X levels to 70-90 IU/dL. The careful control of dose and duration of 
treatment is especially important in cases of major surgery. 
The expected in vivo peak increase in factor X level expressed as IU/dL (or % of normal) can be estimated 
using the following formulae: 
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor X rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.6  
OR 
Increase in factor X level (IU/dL or % of normal) = [total dose (IU)/body weight (kg)] x 1.7  
Post-surgery: dose as necessary to maintain plasma factor X levels at a minimum of 50 IU/dL until the 
subject is no longer at risk of bleeding due to surgery.  
It is recommended that post-infusion plasma factor X levels are measured for each patient before and after 
surgery, to ensure that haemostatic levels are obtained and maintained. 
Method of administration  
Intravenous use. 
After reconstitution, the product should be administered intravenously at a suggested rate of 10 mL/min, but 
no more than 20 mL/min. 
For home therapy, the patient should be given appropriate training and reviewed at intervals.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability  
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible. Coagadex contains traces of 
human proteins other than factor X. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity 
reactions including angioedema, infusion site inflammation (e.g. burning, stinging, erythema), chills, cough, 
dizziness, fever, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, musculoskeletal 
pains, nausea, pruritus, rash, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing. If 
any of these symptoms occur, they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and 
contact their physician. In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be 
observed. 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor X is a possible complication in the management 
of individuals with factor X deficiency.  
In  general,  all  patients  treated  with  human  coagulation  factor X  should  be  carefully  monitored  for  the 
development  of  inhibitors  by  appropriate  clinical  observations  and  laboratory  tests.  If  expected  factor  X 
activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an expected dose, perform an assay that 
measures factor X inhibitor concentration. 
Factor Xa inhibitors 
Coagadex is likely to be counteracted by factor Xa inhibitors, direct or indirect. These antithrombotic agents 
should not be used in patients with factor X deficiency. Coagadex should not be used as an antidote to the 
effects of direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) in patients who do not have factor X deficiency. 
Transmissible agents 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human 
blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific 
markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of 
viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or 
emerging viruses and other pathogens. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and for the 
non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19. 
Vaccination against hepatitis A and B in patients who regularly or repeatedly receive human plasma-derived 
Factor X products may be warranted. 
Sodium content 
Coagadex contains up to 9.2 mg sodium per mL of reconstituted solution, equivalent to 0.0046% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Coagadex is likely to be counteracted by factor Xa inhibitors, direct or indirect (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Due to the rarity of hereditary factor X deficiency, experience regarding the use of Coagadex during pregnancy 
and  breast-feeding  is  not  available.  Therefore,  Coagadex  should  be  used  during  pregnancy  only  if  clearly 
indicated. 
Breast-feeding 
Due to the rarity of hereditary factor X deficiency, experience regarding the use of Coagadex during pregnancy 
and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, Coagadex should be used during breast-feeding only if clearly 
indicated. 
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Coagadex.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Coagadex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The adverse reactions (ADRs) that occurred in the highest frequency were infusion site erythema, infusion site 
pain, fatigue, and back pain.  
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion 
site,  chills,  flushing,  generalised  urticaria,  headache,  hives,  hypotension,  lethargy,  nausea,  restlessness, 
tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely with treatment of 
other  haemophilias  and  may  in  some  cases  have  progressed  to  severe  anaphylaxis  (including  shock). 
Hypersensitivity reactions, allergic reactions, and anaphylaxis have not been reported in Coagadex clinical 
trials. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The  following  adverse  reactions  have  been  reported  in  clinical  studies  involving  27  patients  treated  with 
Coagadex.  Frequencies  have  been  evaluated  according  to  the  following  convention:  very  common  (≥1/10 
subjects); common (≥1/100 to <1/10). Frequencies of uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000) cannot be estimated from the available data.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
One case of accidental overdose was reported in the clinical trials, in which a subject received approximately 
80 IU/kg Coagadex to treat a bleed. No adverse events were reported relating to this overdose. However, there 
is a potential for thromboembolism with overdose which is likely to be associated with a reduced prothrombin 
time below the normal range. Careful clinical assessment by an experienced clinician is recommended with or 
without use of the Wells score, clinical laboratory tests of haemostasis and appropriate ultrasound imaging. 
Treatment of proven or suspected DVT should follow the usual procedures but with monitoring FX.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-haemorrhagics, vitamin K and other haemostatics, coagulation factor X, 
ATC code: B02BD13. 
Mechanism of action 
Factor X is an inactive zymogen, which can be activated by factor IXa (via the intrinsic pathway) or by factor 
VIIa (via the extrinsic pathway). Factor X is converted from its inactive form to the active form (factor Xa) by 
the  cleavage  of  a  52-residue  peptide  from  the  heavy  chain.  Factor  Xa  associates  with  factor  Va  on  a 
phospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex, which activates prothrombin to thrombin in the 
presence of calcium ions. Thrombin then acts upon soluble fibrinogen and factor XIII to generate a cross-
linked fibrin clot. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Coagadex is derived from human plasma and used as a replacement for the naturally existing coagulation factor 
X in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency. 
Clinical efficacy 
In a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy 
of Coagadex, 16 subjects (aged 12 years and above) with moderate to severe hereditary factor X deficiency 
(FX:C < 5 IU/dL) received a dose of 25 IU/kg Coagadex to treat spontaneous, traumatic and menorrhagic 
bleeding episodes. 
The efficacy of Coagadex in treating bleeding episodes was assessed by the subject and/or investigator for 
each new bleeding episode, using a pre-determined bleed-specific ordinal rating scale of excellent, good, poor 
and unassessable. Of the 208 bleeding episodes treated with Coagadex, 187 bleeding episodes in 15 subjects 
were  evaluated  for  efficacy.  Ninety  eight  (53%)  were  major  bleeding  episodes,  and  88  (47%)  were  minor 
bleeds (one bleed was not assessed). Coagadex was considered to be good (7%) or excellent (91%) in treating 
98% of bleeding episodes. Of the 187 bleeding episodes in the efficacy analysis, 155 bleeds (83%) were treated 
with one infusion, 28 bleeds (15%) with two infusions, 3 bleeds (2%) with three infusions and 1 bleed (0.5%) 
with four infusions. The mean dose per infusion and total dose of Coagadex were 25.4 IU/kg and 30.4 IU/kg, 
respectively. Four bleeding episodes in two subjects were considered treatment failures. The recommended 
dose of 25 IU/kg Coagadex to treat a bleed was maintained during the study for 14 of the 16 subjects. The 
other two subjects used doses up to 30 IU/kg and 33 IU/kg.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 184 infusions of Coagadex were given as a preventative measure. Routine prophylaxis was used 
by two subjects. One subject, aged 58 years, used 28 IU/kg once weekly for 8 weeks and, later, 25 IU/kg 
every 2 weeks for more than 5 months. The other subject, aged 22 years, used 24.6 IU/kg once weekly for 
8.5 months. Neither subject had any bleeds during these periods.  
Prophylaxis of Bleeding Episodes 
The third study evaluated the use of Coagadex in routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in nine children 
aged less than 12 years of age. The mean age was 7.3 (range 2.6 to 11.9) years. Eight subjects had severe FX 
deficiency, the other had moderate deficiency. Four subjects were aged 0 to 5 years and five were aged 6 to 11 
years inclusive. Routine prophylaxis was started with unit doses of 40-50 IU/kg and during the first 6 weeks 
trough levels of Factor X were measured to adjust the dose regimen to maintain a trough level of at least 5 
IU/dL.  A  total  of  537  (mean  59.7  per  subject)  prophylactic  infusions  were  administered.  The  median 
prophylactic dose per infusion per subject was 39.60 IU/kg (mean 38.76 IU/kg), and ranged from 18.0 to 47.3 
IU/kg. Median and mean doses per infusion in the four children less than 6 years of age were both 40.1 IU/kg 
(95% CI 30.70, 49.57) and in the five children 6 to 11 years of age inclusive, median dose was 39.6 IU/kg and 
mean dose was 37.7 IU/kg (95% CI: 23.42, 51.91). The median dose interval for all of the nine children was 3 
days  (range  2  to  8  days).  Six  children  (66.7%)  remained  free  of  bleeds  during  routine  prophylaxis.  Three 
children (33.3%), one in the 0-5 years age group and two in the 6-11 years age group had a total of 10 bleeds 
due to epistaxes, trauma or menorrhagia. All were treated with a single infusion of Coagadex; mean and median 
doses 31.7 IU/kg (range 24.6 to 38.8 IU/kg) and all recorded efficacy ratings were categorized as excellent. 
There were no adverse drug reactions in this study in children less than 12 years of age. 
Surgical haemostasis 
The safety and efficacy of Coagadex for perioperative management was evaluated in five subjects aged 14 to 
59 years with mild (n=2), moderate (n=1), and severe (n=2) disease, who underwent a total of seven surgical 
procedures. 
For all surgical procedures, Coagadex was assessed as excellent (no post-operative bleeding, no requirement 
of blood transfusions, and blood loss was no more than ‘as expected’) in controlling blood loss during and 
after surgery. For major surgery, a median of 13 infusions (range 2 to 15 infusions) and a median cumulative 
dose of 181 IU/kg (range 45 to 210 IU/kg) were required to maintain haemostasis. For minor surgery, a median 
of 2.5 infusions (range 1 to 4 infusions) and a median cumulative dose of 89 IU/kg (range 51 to 127 IU/kg) 
were used to maintain haemostasis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In a clinical study of Coagadex in subjects with severe or moderate factor X deficiency (basal FX:C <5 IU/dL), 
the  pharmacokinetics  of  Coagadex  were  assessed  in  16  subjects  after  administration  of  a  nominal  dose  of 
25 IU/kg. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated from plasma factor X:C (one-stage clotting assay) 
activity measurements after subtraction of the pre-dose value. Combining IR values for FX:C at the baseline 
visit (n=16) and the Repeat PK assessment (n=15) gave an overall geometric mean IR of 2.07 IU/dL per IU/kg 
administered (n=31). Similarly, combining t½ values at the Baseline Visit and the Repeat PK assessment gave 
an  overall  geometric  mean  t½  of  29.36  hours.  Systemic  exposure  to  FX:C  at  the  Repeat  PK  visit  (at  least 
6 months later) was equivalent to that at baseline, since repeat/baseline ratios for all PK parameters were within 
the range of 90% to 110%.  
The mean (CV%) for incremental recovery was 2.08 (18.1). The mean (CV%) maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) was 0.504 (17.2) IU/mL.  
The mean (CV%) for area under the curve (AUC 0-144h) was 17.1 (21.0) IU.hr/mL.  
Human coagulation factor X is largely retained within the vascular compartment: mean apparent volume of 
distribution (Vss) was 56.3 (24.0) mL/kg. 
The  mean  (CV%)  half-life  of  human  coagulation  factor  X  was  30.3  (22.8)  hr  and  clearance  was 
1.35 (21.7) mL/kg/hr.

Renal impairment 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted but there is no anticipated effect of gender or renal function 
on the pharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex. 
Hepatic impairment 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted but there is no anticipated effect of gender or hepatic function 
on the pharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex. 
Elderly 
No  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted  but  there  is  no  anticipated  effect  of  age  on  the 
pharmacokinetic profile of Coagadex. 
Paediatric population 
in 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under the age of 12 years.  The 
children (see section 5.1) measured incremental recovery at 30 min (IR30min) after the first dose and after the 
last dose in the study (approximately 6 months later) (see section 5.1) Combining IR30min values for FX:C at 
the baseline visit (n=9) and the Repeat PK assessment (n=9) gave an overall geometric mean IR of 1.74 (range 
1.3-2.2) IU/dL per IU/kg administered (n=9). For the subgroup aged 6-11 years (n=5), the geometric mean 
IR30min  was  1.91  (range  1.6  -2.2)  IU/mL  per  IU/kg  and  for  the  youngest  subgroup,  0-5  years  (n=4)  was 
1.53range 1.3-1.8) IU/mL per IU/kg. 
study 
Trough levels of FX:C were measured during the first 6 weeks of the study to individualise the dose regimen 
and to maintain a trough level of at least 5 IU/dL. During the dose-adjustment phase, two trough levels were 
<5 IU/dL but thereafter none were below this threshold. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
single and repeat-dose toxicity, thrombogenicity and local tolerability. 
No  investigations  on  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  and  reproductive  or  developmental  toxitcity  have  been 
conducted since human plasma coagulation factor X (as contained in Coagadex) is an endogenous protein.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if 
their signs of illness are the same as yours.  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

1.  What Coagadex is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before you use Coagadex   
3.  How to use Coagadex 
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Coagadex   
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Coagadex is and what it is used for 
Coagadex is a concentrate of human coagulation factor X, a protein that is needed for blood to clot. The 
factor X in Coagadex is extracted from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). It is used to treat and 
prevent bleeding in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency, including during surgery.  
Patients with factor X deficiency do not have sufficient factor X for their blood to clot properly, leading to 
excessive bleeding. Coagadex replaces the missing factor X and allows their blood to clot normally.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Coagadex 
Do not use Coagadex: 
- 
if you are allergic to human coagulation factor X or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).  
Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Coagadex:   
- 
- 
if  you  have  a  larger  or  longer  bleed  than  usual  and  the  bleeding  does  not  stop  after  an  injection  of 
Coagadex. 
if you are taking a medicine to prevent blood clotting that works by blocking clotting factor Xa. These 
medicines may prevent Coagadex from working. 
Some patients with a shortage of factor X may develop inhibitors (antibodies) to factor X during treatment. 
This  could  mean  that  the  treatment  will  not  work  properly.  Your  doctor  will  check  regularly  for  the 
development of these antibodies, and especially before an operation. Both before and after treatment with this 
medicine, particularly for your first course of treatment, your doctor will probably carry out tests to check the 
level of factor X in your blood. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Virus safety 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to recipients. These include: 
– careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, 
– the testing of donated plasma for signs of virus/infections, 
– the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. 
The measures taken are considered effective for the following viruses: human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. Despite these measures, 
when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on an 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of 
infections. 
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Coagadex, the name and batch number of 
the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. 
Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you regularly or 
repeatedly receive human plasma-derived factor X products. 
Children and adolescents 
The listed warnings and precautions for adults also apply to children (aged 2 to 11 years) and adolescents 
(aged 12 to 18 years). 
Other medicines and Coagadex 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
There are no known effects of this medicine on the ability to drive or operate machinery. 
Coagadex contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 9.2 mg sodium (the main component of cooking/table salt) in each millilitre of 
solution. This is equivalent to 0.0046% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. 
How to use Coagadex 
3. 
Your treatment should be initiated by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of bleeding disorders. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure.  
Coagadex should be injected directly into a vein. Before injecting this medicine at home, you should have 
received training by your healthcare professional on how to do so.  
Your doctor will explain to you how much you should use, when you should use it and for how long. Your 
doctor will usually tell you your dose in terms of the number of full vials that supply the dose most suited to 
you. Not more than 60 IU/kg daily should be administered in any age group. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in adults 
How much Coagadex is given to treat a bleed or prevent further bleeding? 
Your doctor will tell you how much Coagadex to administer to treat a bleed and to prevent further bleeding; 
the dose required will depend on your normal blood level of factor X 
How much is given before, during and after major surgery? 
Before: The dose of Coagadex used should be sufficient to raise your blood factor X level to between 70 and 
90 units/dL. The dose you need will depend on your normal blood level of factor X and will be calculated by 
your doctor. 
After: During the first few days after the operation, your plasma factor X concentration will be checked 
regularly. It is recommended that your blood factor X level is kept above 50 units/dL. The dose you need 
will be calculated by your doctor. 
If your blood factor X concentration is too low (this will be tested by your doctor), or if it decreases faster 
than expected, an inhibitor to factor X may be present which stops the medicine from working properly. 
Your doctor will arrange for the appropriate laboratory tests to see if this is the case. 
How much is given regularly for long-term prevention of bleeds? 
Your doctor will advise if this use is suitable for you and, if so, of the appropriate dose. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Your doctor will recommend an appropriate dose for you or your child. Doses for children less than 12 years 
old are generally larger than for adolescents and adults. Doses for adolescents will be similar to those for 
adults. 
When to inject Coagadex 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The medicine should be injected when the first sign of bleeding occurs. 
The injection should be repeated as necessary to stop the bleeding. 
Each individual bleed should be judged on its own severity. 
If you are using this medicine for the first time, your doctor will supervise you. 
Dissolving your medicines before use 
Your medicine must only be dissolved in the solvent provided with the product. 
Quantity of Coagadex 
250 IU 
500 IU 
Volume of solvent 
2.5 mL 
5 mL 
Coagadex is supplied with the amount of solvent as shown in the table. 
You can dissolve this medicine using the needle-free Mix2Vial transfer device included within each pack.  
Bring the containers of Coagadex to room temperature before mixing. 
Make up the medicine as follows: 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1 
• Remove the cap from the powder vial and clean the top of the 
stopper with an alcohol swab. 
• Repeat this step with the vial of solvent. 
• Peel back the top of the transfer device package but leave the device in the 
package. 
Step 2 
• Place the blue end of the transfer device on the solvent vial and push straight 
down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and snaps into place. 
• Remove the plastic outer packaging from the transfer device and discard it, 
taking care not to touch the exposed end of the device. 
Step 3 
• Turn the solvent vial upside down with the device still attached. 
• Place the clear end of the transfer device on the powder vial and push 
straight down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and snaps into 
place. 
Step 4 
• The solvent will be pulled into the powder vial by the vacuum contained 
within it. 
• Gently swirl the vial to make sure the powder is thoroughly mixed. Do not 
shake the vial. 
• A colourless, clear or slightly pearl-like solution should be obtained, usually 
in about 1 minute (5 minutes maximum). 
Step 5 
• Separate the empty solvent vial and blue part of the transfer device from the 
clear part by unscrewing anti-clockwise. 
• Take an empty syringe (not provided in the Coagadex pack) and draw air 
into it by pulling the plunger to match the required volume of water added in 
step 4. 
• Connect the syringe to the clear part of the transfer device and push the air 
in the syringe into the vial. 
Step 6 
• Immediately invert the vial of solution, which will be drawn into the 
syringe. 
• Disconnect the filled syringe from the device. 
• The product is now ready for use. Follow the normal safety practices for 
administration. Make sure you use the product within an hour after it has been 
made up. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use this medicine: 
- 
- 
if the solvent is not pulled into the vial (this indicates loss of vacuum in the vial, so the 
powder must not be used). 
if the dissolved powder and solvent form a gel or a clot (if this happens please tell your healthcare 
provider, reporting the batch number printed on the vial). 
If you use more Coagadex than you should 
If you administer more of this medicine than your doctor prescribed, it is possible you might develop a blood 
clot. If you think you may be using too much, stop the injection and tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse. If 
you know you have used too much, tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.  
If you forget to use Coagadex 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Inject your normal dose as you remember and then 
continue dosing as instructed by your doctor. 
If you stop using Coagadex 
Always consult your doctor before deciding to stop your treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

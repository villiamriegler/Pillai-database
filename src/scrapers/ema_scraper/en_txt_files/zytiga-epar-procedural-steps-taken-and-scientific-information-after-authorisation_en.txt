1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In a CYP2C8 drug drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, 
the AUC of pioglitazone was increased by 46% and the 
AUCs for M III and M IV, the active metabolites of 
pioglitazone, each decreased by 10% when pioglitazone 
was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg 
abiraterone acetate.  Patients should be monitored for signs 
of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow 
therapeutic index if used concomitantly. Examples of 
medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8 include 
pioglitazone and repaglinide.

The MAH has provided results of the final analysis of OS 
results from study PCR3011 (Lattitude); this is a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
designed to determine the efficacy of abiraterone 
acetate and low-dose prednisone in men with 
metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer. The MAH 
took the occasion to update the product information 
as per the latest QRD version and to update local 
representative for Spain and Hungary in the package 
from study PCR3011. OS results were statistically 
significant with a HR of 0.661 [95% CI: 0.564, 0.775] and 
an improvement in median OS of 16.8 months (53.3 
months in the AA-P arm and 36.5 months in the Placebo 
arm).

substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used 
concomitantly. 
In vitro, the major metabolites abiraterone sulphate and N-
oxide abiraterone sulphate were shown to inhibit the 
hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and as a consequence 
it may increase the concentrations of drugs eliminated by 
OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to confirm 
transporter based interaction.

study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse. In a 24 month 
carcinogenicity study in the rat, abiraterone acetate 
increased the incidence of interstitial cell neoplasms in the 
testes. This finding is considered related to the 
pharmacological action of abiraterone and rat specific. 
Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in female rats.

In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study (PCR 1003) 
to include a warning against use of strong CYP3A4 
inducers during treatment with abiraterone and to 
amend the information on interactions of abiraterone 
with inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4, based on the 
results of two relevant studies (PCR 1002 and PCR 
1003). The MAH also took the opportunity to make a 
minor amendment of information related to overdose

inducer rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days followed by a 
single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg, the mean 
plasma AUC∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55%. 
Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, 
phenobarbital, St. John's wort [Hypericum perforatum]) 
during treatment with Zytiga are to be avoided, unless 
there is no therapeutic alternative.  
In a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study 
(PCR1002) of healthy subjects, coadministration of 
ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically 
meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone.

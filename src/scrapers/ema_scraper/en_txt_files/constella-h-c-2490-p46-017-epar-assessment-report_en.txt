1.  Introduction 
On 19-10-2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study, LIN-MD-67, for Constella 
(linaclotide), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has not been provided with this submission.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study LIN-MD-67 is part of the agreed PIP (EMEA-000927-PIP01-10-M03). The 
applicant states that there are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH with this study. There 
are no new data that change or result in a new benefit/risk evaluation. Consequently, no changes were 
made to the PI. 
The applicant also states that they have taken the opportunity to correct editorial errors in the tabular 
listing of the clinical studies in Module 5.2 for study LIN-MD-62. This correction is not part of the 
assessment. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational product used in study LIN-MD-67 refers to a capsule formulation with different 
strengths compared to the marketed formulation, which contains 290 µg active substance. The 
strength of the capsules used were 290 µg, 145 µg, 72 µg, and 36 µg. 
However, the administration was not by swallowing whole capsules, but contents were to be sprinkled 
into 20 mL of bottled water, and 5 mL of this solution is dosed to the participant using an oral syringe. 
The following scheme was used: 
- 36 μg capsules, were used to prepare the 9 μg dose 
- 72 μg capsules, were used to prepare the 18 μg dose 
- 145 μg capsules, were used to prepare the 36 μg dose 
- 290 μg capsules, were used to prepare the 72 μg dose 
- Placebo preparation is identical for all dose cohorts 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study LIN-MD-67, A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Sequential, 
Ascending, Multidose Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Linaclotide in Pediatric Participants 
(Age 2 to 5 Years) with Functional Constipation. 
The study is submitted with a complete study report, protocol, and necessary appendices and 
documents. However, the study report contains mainly raw data tables only (usually divided by the 
treatment cohorts, see below), which are not very convenient for reading.

2.3.2.  Clinical study LIN-MD-67 
Description 
Study LIN-MD-67 was a A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Sequential, 
Ascending, Multidose Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Linaclotide in Pediatric Participants 
(Age 2 to 5 Years) with Functional Constipation 
The study was initiated (first patient in) 14 October 2019, and finalised (last subject visit) 27 April 
2021. The study was conducted as a multi-centre study in the USA. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The targeted population for this study were male and female participants aged 2 to 5 years. The main 
inclusion criterion refers to the presence of functional constipation (FC) according to the Rome III 
criteria:  
According to these criteria, a participant must suffer from FC, for at least 2 months before Screening 
(Visit 1) (for participants aged ≥ 4 years old), or for at least 1 month before Screening (Visit 1) (for 
participants aged < 4 years old), the participant has had 2 or fewer defecations (with each defecation 
occurring in the absence of any laxative, suppository, or enema use during the preceding 24 hours) per 
week. 
In addition, at least once per week, the participant must meet 1 or more of the following: 
a. History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention 
b. History of painful or hard bowel movements (BMs) 
c. Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum 
d. History of large diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet 
e. At least one episode of fecal incontinence per week after the acquisition of toileting skills 
In addition, participants were required to have an average of fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel 
movement (SBMs) per week during the 14 days before the randomization day and up to the 
randomization (including the clinic eDiary assessments reported before administration of the first dose 
of double-blind study intervention on the randomization day). An SBM is defined as a BM that occurs in 
the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day 
before the BM. 
All concomitant medication potentially influencing GI motility (not only laxatives) were to be washed 
out before intake of the trial medication, and was forbidden throughout the trial duration. 
Assessor’s comment: 
It appears somewhat surprising that Rome III instead of Rome IV is used for this study, however, the 
differences are considered marginal. For comparison, the (short) definition of Rome IV for childhood FC 
is as follows: Must include one month of at least two of the following in infants up to 4 years of age: 
- 
Two or fewer defecations per week, - History of excessive stool retention, - History of painful 
or hard bowel movements, - History of large diameter stools, - Presence of a large fecal mass 
in the rectum

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 4/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
In toilet-trained children, the following additional criteria may be used: -At least one 
episode/week of incontinence after the acquisition of toileting skills, - History of large diameter 
stools which may obstruct the toilet 
The inclusion criteria adequately defined a childhood FC population. 
Treatments 
The study was to consist of up to 4 Cohorts, each of which were to be 9 to 12 weeks in duration: 2- to 
4-week Screening Period, a 2- to 3-week Preintervention Period, followed by a 4-week double-blind 
Study Intervention Period, and a 1-week Postintervention Period. 
Cohort 1 was to receive 18 µg (or matching placebo), cohort 2 36 µg, Cohort 3 72 µg. These cohorts 
were to consist of 8 participants randomised in 3:1 ratio. A DSMB was to evaluate safety after 
completion of the previous cohorts and to determine the dose of the upcoming cohort (could 
recommend dose proposed, or lowering of the dose) Cohort 4 planned to consist of 6 participants 
(termed “Final Cohort”) was to be treated with the highest dose determined to be safe during the 
previous cohort treatments, depending on the recommendation of the DSMB with a 5:1 randomisation. 
In consequence, 30 patients maximum were to be recruited for the study. 
Objective(s) 
The purpose of this Phase 2 study was to investigate the potential therapeutic dose(s) of linaclotide in 
the target pediatric subset of participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC. 
According to the protocol, the objectives were defined as follows: To evaluate the dose response, 
safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of study intervention with linaclotide compared with placebo in pediatric 
participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC. 
Given the lack of clinical data in this younger age group, a sequential, ascending multidose escalation 
design was selected. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The applicant also states that there is a contraindication for the product for patients lower than 6 years 
of age, which, however, is not true for the EU licensed product, where only a recommendation against 
the treatment of adolescents, and children is included. It may also refer to a potential license (in the 
US) for FC in adults as well as children (older than 6 years), which is, however, currently unclear. 
Irrespective of the licensing status in the US, it also needs to be reminded upon the fact that the 
license in the EU if for IBS-C only. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following endpoints were defined for this study: 
-  Change from baseline in 4-week overall spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency rate 
(SBMs/week) during the Study Intervention Period of each cohort 
-  Change from Baseline in 4-Week Stool Consistency Reported by the Caregiver During the 
Intervention Period of Each Cohort (reported according to the paediatricBristol Stool Form 
Scale (BSFS). 
-  Change from Baseline in 4-Week Straining Reported by the Caregiver During Study 
Intervention Period for Each Cohort

- 
Proportion of days with fecal incontinence during study intervention period (for participants 
who have acquired toileting skills during daytime and nighttime or acquired toileting skills 
during daytime only) within each cohort 
The study objectives also included the determination of PK and whether PK was similar in children 
compared to adults, or whether systemic exposure was higher in children. Sparse PK sampling was 
therefore also included in the study. 
The safety objective was addressed by AE monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG, 
height and weight, as well as physical examinations. 
Sample size 
This was an explorative study, and no sample size calculation was undertaken. The study was designed 
to enrol a sufficient population in order to “observe the clinical response trends and monitor safety”. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)+ 
After a parent/LAR/caregiver signed the permission/consent at Screening (Visit 1), the participant was 
assigned a randomization number.  
The randomization number encodes the participant’s assignment to 1 of the 2 study intervention 
groups of the study, according to the randomization schedule generated prior to the study by the 
statistics department at the sponsor. Each participant was dispensed blinded study intervention, 
labelled with his/her unique PID number, throughout the study. 
No unblinding – except for the DSMB purposes – was to take place unless in case of emergency. 
Statistical Methods 
All efficacy analyses were to be performed on the mITT population defined as all randomized patients 
who have received at least one dose of intervention, and who had at least 1 post-baseline entry on 
BMs. 
SBM frequency, stool consistency, straining, and incontinence were to be based on entries during the 
respective evaluation period in the eDiary. 
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, standard error of mean, minimum, and maximum) were to 
be provided by study intervention group for each cohort as main analysis approach. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The use of descriptive statistics is fully acceptable considering the context of the trial 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 95 potential participants were screened. Of these, 10 were discontinued from screening due 
to COVID-19 disease, and 8 were screen failures. Of the 68 remaining patients, 35 completed the pre-
treatment phase, and 33 were discontinued, mostly due to screen failure. 
Of the 35 remaining participants, 9 were randomised to Cohort 1, 9 to Cohort 2, 8 to Cohort 3 and 9 to 
the Final Cohort. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

For those participants randomized to receive linaclotide, participants in Cohort 1 received an 18 μg 
dose, in Cohort 2 received a 36 μg dose, and in Cohort 3 and the Final, Cohort received a 72 μg dose.  
1 patient in the pooled final cohort/cohort 3 (dosed with 72 µg) discontinued double-blind treatment. 
All other participants completed the four-week treatment course. 
Baseline data 
Due to the mode of reporting (per cohort) no overview on overall demographics is available. The 
cohort 1 had a mean age of 4.0 years ranging from 2 to 5. Cohort 2 had a mean age of 3.2 years, with 
a similar range as cohort 1.  Cohort 3 had a mean age of 3.9 years ranging from 3-5, and Final Cohort 
had a mean age of 3.6 years ranging from 2 to 5. The pooled cohort [cohort 3+final cohort] had a 
mean age of 3.5 with a range from 3-4 years. Sex was quite equally distributed in all cohorts, and the 
proportion of black/African American patients was overall higher than the proportion of Whites, with 
some discrepancy in the 3 cohorts. 
The mean weight in the cohorts 1, 2, 3, final and pooled placebo was 18.42 kg, 15.62 kg, 20.48 kg, 
19.59 kg, 16.85 kg, the height was 104.53 cm, 98.72 cm, 105.58 cm, 104.58 cm, 100.00 cm and the 
BMI was 16.75 kg/m2, 15.99 kg/m2, 18.31 kg/m2 17.88 kg/m2 , 16.65 kg/m2 respectively. The mean 
weight for the pooled cohort [cohort 3+final chort was 16.85 kg, the height was 100.00, and the BMI 
was 16.65 kg/m2.  While therefore, the cohorts overall were quite similar, for the small placebo groups 
in the four cohorts, some relevant deviations from the active treatment cohorts can be detected. 
The baseline overall SBM frequency rate as given by the caregiver in cohorts 1, 2, 3, final and pooled 
placebo was 1.502, 0.590, 1.026, 0.966, 1.267, the SBM frequency as given by all observers was 
1.609, 0.751, 1.026, 1.126, 1.388, stool consistency was 1.643, 1.667, 2.707, 2.017, 2.024 the 
frequency of straining was 2.436, 2.667, 2.427, 2.556, 2.548 and the proportion of days with fecal 
incontinence was 0.0, 0.019, 0.020, 0.013 and 0.0. Similar to the data on weight, BMI and height 
there were also relevant discrepancies between placebo cohorts and active cohorts within the cohorts 
1, 2, and pooled cohort. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The study was obviously burdened with some inconsistencies with regard to the severity of 
constipation within and between the treatment cohorts evaluated.  
Number analysed 
Efficacy results are reported for the mITT population consisting of all randomised patients. As reported 
above, 1 patient in the “pooled cohort” discontinued treatment early. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy results are reported only very briefly by the applicant in the study report, which is reproduced 
below: 
- 
For the 4-week overall SBM frequency rate (SBMs/week) observed by the caregiver, the mean 
change from Baseline was numerically higher in the linaclotide 18 μg and 72 μg groups 
compared to the placebo group, and similar in the linaclotide 36 μg group compared to the 
placebo group. 
- 
The mean change from Baseline in the 4-week stool consistency (based on BSFS) reported by 
caregivers was numerically lower in the linaclotide 18 μg group compared to the placebo group 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

and numerically higher in the linaclotide 36 μg and 72 μg groups compared to the placebo 
groups. 
- 
The mean change (decrease) from Baseline in the 4-week straining reported by caregivers was 
similar in the linaclotide 18 μg and 36 μg groups versus placebo and numerically higher in the 
linaclotide 72 μg group versus placebo.  
- 
The proportion of days with fecal incontinence during the study treatment period was low for 
both the linaclotide treatment groups and the placebo groups. 
In the following, a summary table trying to provide the data in a synoptic manner is presented and is 
restricted to include the three endpoints for which some changes could be detected. For ease of 
comparison, the pooled placebo group only is included.

Participants in Cohorts 1-3 were to be randomized on Study Day 1 (Visit 3) at a 1:3 ratio to either a 
pre-dose or post-dose PK sample and the 6 participants in the Final Cohort were to be randomized at a 
1:2 ratio to either a pre-dose or post-dose PK sample, respectively, to be completed before or after the 
last dose of study intervention at Visit 5 (Week 4) for determination of linaclotide and active metabolite 
(MM-419447) concentrations in plasma. One blood sample was to be collected from each participant at 
Visit 5 (Week 4) before or after the last dose of study intervention, along with all laboratory blood 
samples at same time. Postintervention PK sample were to be collected at 1 to 8 hours post-dose. 
The plasma concentrations of linaclotide and its active metabolite MM-419447 were below the limit of 
quantitation in all the pediatric participants enrolled in this study. Thus, no PK parameters were 
calculated. 
Safety results 
For the reporting of safety, and AE was considered as treatment-emergent (TEAE) if the AE began on 
or after the date of the first dose of study intervention or the AE was present before the data of the 
first dose of study intervention, but increased in severity of became serious on or after the data of the 
first dose of study intervention. 
Most participants did not experience AEs. Two participants (28.6%) in Cohort 1 and 2 participants in 
the pooled Cohort 3 and the Final Cohort (15.4%) experienced TEAEs, one of which was treatment-
related (mild diarrhea).  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 8/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no serious adverse events (SAE) experienced by any participants in this study. In addition, 
two participants in Cohort 1 experienced TEAEs, including otitis media, increased blood creatinine, and 
cough. Two participants in the pooled Cohort 3 and the Final Cohort experienced TEAEs, including 
upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, and an ear infection. 
All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Only one event (mild diarrhoea) was considered treatment 
related. 
There were no deaths, SAEs, or AESIs (defined as significant volume depletion, and/or significant 
electrolyte abnormality, and/or ECG abnormality considered related to diarrhoea) during the study. 
There were no unexpected or clinically relevant changes to either vital signs or ECG measurements. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Obviously, only 1 diarrhoea event was treatment-emergent, which means that two participants had a 
diarrhoea event before intake of the study medication, which is remarkable in a cohort of patients with 
FC. While cough and otitis media appear to be common AEs in a paediatric cohort, the GI AEs appear 
to be similar to what is observed in adults (what is known from the IBS population). The conclusion of 
the applicant that the safety profile was consistent with prior pediatric linaclotide FC study in patients 
6-17 years and prior adult linaclotide studies can, however, not be fully assessed, since there was no 
full evaluation of paediatric data in the EU up to now. However, the consistency with the adult safety 
profile can be agreed with. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant has filed a completed study (LIN-MD-67) conducted in paediatric patients aged 2-5 
suffering from chronic constipation as defined by the Rome III criteria. The study was an explorative, 
combined safety, and dose-exploration trial which included 35 patients divided into four cohorts, which 
were subsequently recruited and randomised to increasing doses of linaclotide. A DSMB was installed 
for the conduct of the study, which evaluated unblinded safety data from the lower preceding dose 
cohorts before the following cohort using higher doses was to be treated. 
The study design and preliminary objectives of the trial are considered fully adequate, and the cautious 
proceeding with staggered randomisation into the three different dose-cohorts was welcomed. The trial 
was addressing multiple objectives with dose exploration, overall safety, as well as the determination 
of PK. 
The small sizes of the cohorts, as well as finally also partly of the treatment groups created some 
imbalances with regard to the baseline characteristics, especially for the baseline disease severity, 
which may have influenced the overall trial results, and has made efficacy evaluation difficult and 
partly inconsistent. 
Nevertheless, the following conclusions can be drawn from the study: 
- 
The PK of the compound is obviously not different from what is known from the adult 
population, with none of the participants developing measurable plasma concentrations during 
the course of the study, based on sparse PK sampling, and up to doses of 72 µg daily in the 
paediatric population aged 2-5 years. 
- 
The safety profile of the compound appears to be similar to what is known from the adult 
population (in EU restricted to the IBS-C population), which is mainly the development of 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 9/13 
 
 
 
 
 
rather mild AEs related to the PD action of the compound (diarrhoea). Relevant concerns with 
regard to the treatment of 2-5 year old children with doses up to 72 µg cannot be derived. 
-  Although the applicant does not conclude on the efficacy results, it appears that some effects 
can be detected which might warrant further evaluation in this population, especially showing 
consistently superior results above placebo in the highest dose evaluated. 
The applicant has neither displayed consistently the overall context of the trial – with regard to the 
overall development plans in the indication functional constipation – nor with regard to their final 
assessment of the trial, and whether it is considered encouraging (or de-couraging) with regard to the 
further development and conduct of confirmatory trials in the younger paediatric population. 
The applicant has stated in their submission that there are currently no regulatory consequences with 
regard to the finalisation of this trial, and that there is no intent for further changes (e.g. for the PI) in 
Europe. This is agreed with, as far as the immediate consequences of the trial are concerned. 
However, in order to fully understand the context of the filing of the trial, as well as the trial results, 
the applicant is requested to answer a couple of additional questions. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
 Not Fulfilled: 
No further action is required, however, a request for supplementary information is brought forward, 
and the applicant should provide statements as requested below, to enable a full assessment of the 
context of the trial. (See 4.) 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide statements as requested below, to enable a full 
assessment of the context of the trial as part of this procedure. (see section 4.0 “Request for 
supplementary information”). 
4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The MAH is requested to display the history of the development of linaclotide in the paediatric 
indication referring to both the fact that the compound is licensed in the EU for IBS-C only, and 
referring to the agreed PIP. 
2.  The MAH is requested to display their assessment of the trial data more clearly, and whether 
the partly inconclusive results of the trial has led to any conclusions with regard to the 
continuation of exploring (and confirming) the efficacy and safety of the compound in FC in 
small children. In case a further development is planned, these plans should be displayed. 
3.  Although marketing the compound in indications other than (adult) IBS-C is the decision of the 
MAH, the MAH is asked to display their further regulatory strategy with regard to marketing of 
the compound in the EU for the indication of functional constipation, including children. 
The timetable is a 30-day response timetable without a clock stop.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  The MAH is requested to display the history of the development of linaclotide in the 
paediatric indication referring to both the fact that the compound is licensed in the EU for 
IBS-C only and referring to the agreed PIP. 
MAH Response: 
The initial Constella PIP EMEA-00927-PIP01-10 was approved by PDCO on 6th May 2011 for the 
indication functional constipation. Following the initial approval, five PIP modifications have 
been  submitted to align the paediatric plan globally in paediatric patients. Currently the MAH 
does not  intend to register the IBS-C indication in the EU Constella marketing authorisation for 
children. The MAH will continue to submit final CSRs for paediatric studies for Linaclotide 
regardless of the  studied indication in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006, however currently does not plan to register this indication for the EU licence. 
Assessment of the MAHs response. 
The applicant only makes a short statement about the approved PIP, which was, right from the 
initial approval, referring to a different indication than the one approved for adults in the EU. The 
intention not to register the IBS-C indication for children is noted, as well as the intention to 
submit the results of all paediatric studies in accordance with Article 46 of Reg (EC) 1901/2006.  
Overall Conclusion: 
Issue resolved. 
2.  The MAH is requested to display their assessment of the trial data more clearly, and 
whether the partly inconclusive results of the trial has led to any conclusions with regard to 
the continuation of exploring (and confirming) the efficacy and safety of the compound in 
FC in small children. In case a further development is planned, these plans should be 
displayed. 
MAH Response: 
With the limitations of the exploratory nature of the phase 2 study LIN-MD-67, there is a 
numerical improvement in 3 out of the 4 efficacy endpoints for the highest dose of 
linaclotide  used in this trial in 2–5-year-old patients (spontaneous bowel movement, 
straining and consistency). This finding warrants further evaluation in a phase 3 study 
which is planned to confirm the efficacy and safety of linaclotide versus placebo. The global 
study will consist of a  phase 3 component (part 1) and a long-term safety component (part 
2) and is projected to start in 2022. Consequently, any updates to the proposed paediatric 
studies will be submitted to PDCO as a PIP modification in Q3 2022. 
Assessment of the MAHs response. 
The MAH has displayed their intent for further develop the CC-indication in children, including 
young children of 2-5 years of age, and have displayed their plans to conduc a subsequent phase 
3 study, starting this year. This is welcomed. A subsequent PIP modification is planned to be 
submitted in Q3. The answer is satisfactory. 
Overall Conclusion: 
Issue resolved.

of the compound in the EU for the indication of functional constipation, including children. 
MAH Response: 
The MAH currently does not plan to initiate clinical trials in adults with functional 
constipation    and does not plan to seek the registration of functional constipation in children 
as an EU indication. The MAH will review the data once the development program is 
finalised. The clinical trial studies that are currently ongoing and planned will be completed 
as per the current agreed PIP EMEA-00927-PIP01-M06 and final study results will be 
submitted to the EMA in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
Assessment of the MAHs response. 
The applicant has stated that the functional constipation indication for children is not intended for 
registration in the EU. This is noted, and not regarded to be of concern considering the wide 
availability of treatment alternatives for this indication, even for young children. The applicant has 
renewed their intention to adhere to the agreed PIP. The answer is satisfactory. 
Overall Conclusion: 
Issue resolved. 
5.  Rapporteur’s revised overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
The applicant has presented study LIN-MD-67 completed. This study was part of the agreed PIP 
(EMEA-000927-PIP01-10-M03) conducted in paediatric patients aged 2-5 suffering from chronic 
constipation as defined by the Rome III criteria. The applicant has stated that the functional 
constipation indication for children is not intended for registration in the EU. This was not regarded to 
be of concern considering the wide availability of treatment alternatives for this indication. No 
regulatory consequences were identified with this study which was agreed by the CHMP. However, a 
request for supplementary information was brought forward, to enable a full assessment of the context 
of the trial. All the points requested for clarification have been resolved. 
Furthermore, there were no new data that change or result in a new benefit/risk evaluation and, 
consequently, no changes were proposed to be made to the PI.

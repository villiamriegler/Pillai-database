1.  Scientific discussion 
The studies included in this application have been performed according the GCP standards.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban 15mg and 20 mg tablets have 
been characterised and reported in previous submissions including the exposure and exposure –
response in the indications DVT (deep vein thrombosis)   and PE (pulmonary embolism). 
In this application, one additional food effect study (Japanese breakfast meal) and one additional drug 
interaction study (rifampicin) are submitted (EINSTEIN CYP). PK exposure was not obtained in the 
phase III studies supporting the indications. However, measurements to prothrombin time (PT) was 
obtained and analysed. The simulations to exposure in patients in moderate/severe renal impairment 
are also reviewed.  
The proposed indication for treatment of PE is based on one pivotal phase III study, study 11702 PE 
with support from studies 11702 DVT in treatment of DVT (comparison against enoxaparin and VKA) 
and 11899 in continued treatment of VTE after 6 to 14 months of anticoagulant treatment (comparison 
against placebo. These latter two studies supported the previous application for treatment of DVT. 
1.1.  Clinical pharmacology aspects 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg tablets have 
been characterised and reported in previous submissions including the exposure and exposure-
response in the indications (VTE and PE) under consideration. 
In this submission one additional food effect study (Japanese breakfast meal) and one additional drug-
drug interaction study (rifampicin) is covered (EINSTEIN CYP). PK exposure was not obtained in the 
phase III studies supporting the indications. However, measurements of prothrombin time (PT) was 
obtained and analysed. The simulations of exposure to rivaroxaban in patients with moderate/severe 
renal impairment were also reviewed. 
1.1.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
1.1.1.1.  Food effect study (study 15921) 
1.1.1.1.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Plasma rivaroxaban concentrations were measured using a fully validated high performance liquid 
chromatography assay with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). 
For the analysis of the food interaction study standard non-compartmental analysis, NCA, was 
employed. The study was analysed using population modelling in NONMEM. 
The method used for statistical analysis of the food interaction study was considered appropriate by 
the CHMP. 
For calculation of the difference between test and reference treatment in the food interaction study 
ANOVA was employed. The method used for statistical analysis of the food interaction study was 
considered appropriate.

This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-fold cross-over study to investigate the effect of 
a Japanese meal on the safety, tolerability, and PK of a 15-mg immediate-release rivaroxaban tablet 
given orally in the morning to 12 healthy young Japanese male subjects. (Study 15921 / A57650, 
Module 5.3.1.2) The Japanese breakfast contained ca. 17 % proteins, 53 % carbohydrates, 30 % fat 
with an energy content of 900 kcal in total. Rich pharmacokinetic sampling up to 72 hours after dose 
was performed. 
1.1.1.1.2.  Results 
One subject did not complete both treatment periods, thus 11 subjects contributed with data for the 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. Key PK parameters are summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1: PK parameters in plasma of rivaroxaban following administration of the 15-mg tablet under 
fasting and fed conditions [geometric mean/%CV (range); all subjects valid for PK, n=11] (Study 
15921) 
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) estimated the LS means ratios [90% CI] of AUC and Cmax 
(food/fasted) to 0.939 [0.806 to 1.094] and 0.937 [0.727 to 1.208] respectively. It can be noted that 
the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval for Cmax was below 0.8. 
In Figure 1 the geometric mean (sd) of observed plasma concentration vs. time profiles following 
fasting (solid circles) and fed (open circles) conditions are shown. The unit of the y-axis is µg/L and on 
the x-axis a combination of days and hours after dose.

Figure 1 Plasma concentrations (μg/L) of rivaroxaban after a single dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban in the 
fasting state and after a single dose of 15 mg rivaroxaban together with a Japanese breakfast, 
geometric means, n = 11, linear scale, fasting (solid circles) and fed (open circles) 
1.1.1.1.3.  Discussion  
Absorption of rivaroxaban was slower after Japanese breakfast with tmax occurring at 4 hours 
compared to 2.5 hours after dose. The AUC following 15 mg rivaroxaban was not different between 
fasting and fed conditions based on bioequivalence criteria. However, the 90% CI for ratio of Cmax 
included 0.8.  
Based on several specific studies, and cross study comparisons, it has previously been shown that food 
influences the absorption of rivaroxaban with greater absorption in the fed state compared to a fasting 
state. The effect is more pronounced at doses above 10 mg and it has led to recommendations in the 
currently approved SmPCs to administer rivaroxaban with food for indications using 15 mg or 20 mg 
doses but for indications using lower doses, rivaroxaban may be administered irrespective of food 
intake. 
This new study gives somewhat contradictory results, with indications of a slightly lower absorption in 
the fed state compared to the fasting state, as compared to the previous data. The effect is likely not 
clinically relevant and there seem to be no reason from a PK perspective to put restrictions regarding 
food intake in the SmPC for the 15 mg dose. 
Several aspects nevertheless points towards the adequacy to maintain the current wording of the 
SmPC for both 15 and 20 mg strengths “The tablets are to be taken with food” since: 
1)  the phase III study submitted in support of this variation included a recommendation to 
administer rivaroxaban with food 
2) 
it is not known if the meal used in Study 15921 / A57650 is representative of an European 
meal 
3)  previous analyses of pooled data from phase I studies point to a slight increase in the 
rivaroxaban exposure when the 15-mg tablet is administered with food.

1.1.1.2.  Drug interaction study 
1.1.1.2.1.  Methods- analysis of data submitted 
Rifampicin (600 mg od), classified as strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer, has been shown to lead to a 
significant decrease in rivaroxaban elimination half-life and an approximately 50% reduction in 
rivaroxaban plasma exposure in healthy volunteers. 
The EINSTEIN CYP cohort study was a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the 
population PK /PD of an adapted rivaroxaban dosing regimen in patients with acute, proximal DVT or 
acute PE and concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (i.e. carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
rifampicin/rifampin, or rifabutin). 
The PK/PD of an adapted rivaroxaban dosing regimen (30 mg bid in the first 3 weeks of treatment, 
followed by 20 mg bid) was studied in 19 patients treated for DVT or PE and who concomitantly were 
medicated with a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer. Fifteen patients received (ethambutol, isoniazid, 
pyrazinamide, rifampicin) and 4 patients received phenytoin. The adapted dosing regimen in these 
patients led to a similar exposure and pharmacodynamics when compared to patients treated for DVT 
(15 mg bid in the first 3 weeks of treatment, followed by 20 mg od) without the concomitant 
administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer. 
1.1.1.2.2.  Results 
Oral clearance (CL/F) in patients included in the EINSTEIN CYP cohort was estimated to 10.8 L/h as 
compared to 5.67 L/h in the DVT population without strong CYP3A4 inducer comedication. In Table 1 
model derived secondary PK parameters (AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss) for the EINSTEIN CYP cohort are 
compared with those simulated prior to the study and parameters derived from the DVT population 
without CYP3A4 inducer treatment. 
Table 1 Derived PK parameters in patients treated for DVT or PE with concomitant intake of a strong 
CYP3A4 inducer (Study 13812), B) simulated PK parameters in patients with concomitant intake of a 
strong CYP3A4 inducer, based on Phase II data from patients treated for DVT (Study 15539), and C) PK 
parameters derived from phase II data in patients treated for DVT (Study 12143). Median (5%/95% 
percentiles) 
The inter-individual variability (IIV) in clearance for patients treated with strong CYP3A4 inducers was 
estimated to 38.7% (approximate CV) which was similar to the IIV estimated (39.9%) in a model of 
rivaroxaban exposure based on a Phase II dose-ranging study in DVT patients.

1.1.1.2.3.  Discussion 
The number of patients included in the rifampicin interaction study (n=19) was small compared to the 
planned number of patients (n=50). However, the result did not contradict the previously established 
interaction potential of strong CYP3A4 inducers on the PK of rivaroxaban in healthy volunteers and 
point in the direction that this interaction is occurring also in patients. 
These additional data in conclusion do not justify a need to amend the SmPC. 
1.1.1.3.  Impaired renal function 
The MAH proposed the following recommendations in SmPC section 4.2 (posology) in patients with 
reduced renal function:  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 
ml/min) (see section 5.2). 
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 15 - 
29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dosage recommendations apply:  
–  For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non valvular atrial 
fibrillation, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). 
–  For the treatment of DVT and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: Patients should be treated 
with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, the recommended dose is 15 mg once 
daily based on PK modelling (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
–  For the treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: Patients should be 
treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, the recommended 
dose is 20 mg once daily (see section 5.2). 
Limited clinical data for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15   29 ml/min) 
indicate that rivaroxaban plasma concentrations are significantly increased therefore, Xarelto is to be 
used with caution in these patients. Use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 
ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
CHMP discussion 
At present, with the additional data submitted in the application, there is a larger amount of clinical 
data available from the combination of studies EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE. In both these studies, 
patients with a CLCR between 30 and 50 mL/min were dosed 20 mg QD. This has been extensively 
discussed in the assessment of the MAH responses and is considered acceptable and the proposal 
above accepted. The CHMP considered that the DVT posology should be in line with the PE posology for 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.  
In conclusion, the proposed wording for the moderate renal impairment was subsequently amended as 
follows: 
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance 
15 - 29 ml/min) renal impairment the following dosage recommendations apply: 
• 
• 
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, 
the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily (see section 5.2). 
For the treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE: Patients 
should be treated with 15 mg twice daily for the first 3 weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 6/49 
 
 
 
 
 
Thereafter, the recommended dose is 20 mg once daily. A reduction of the dose from 20 mg 
once daily to 15 mg once daily should be considered if the patient’s assessed risk for 
bleeding outweighs the risk for recurrent DVT and PE. The recommendation for the use 
of 15 mg is based on PK modelling and has not been studied in this clinical setting (see 
sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
1.1.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
1.1.2.1.  Introduction 
The linear prothrombin time (PT)/rivaroxaban plasma concentration relationship in DVT Treatment EXT 
patients in phase II supported the use of PT in exposure-driven safety/efficacy analyses in PE patients. 
Therefore, PT measurements at baseline (before first rivaroxaban dose), and at steady-state trough 
(approximately 12 hours post-dosing for b.i.d. or 24 hours post-dosing for o.d.) and peak (2 to 4 hours 
after tablet intake), were scheduled for all patients enrolled in the phase III DVT and PE studies 
(11702). 
1.1.2.2.  Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The relation between rivaroxaban exposure and effect on factor Xa activity and prothrombin time was 
not evaluated in PE patients since PK was not obtained. However, PE patients exhibited predictable PT 
Neoplastin® values at baseline, and at steady-state peak and trough when treated with 15 mg b.i.d. 
and 20 mg rivaroxaban o.d. The 5/95 percentiles for PT at maximum effect, 2 - 4 h after tablet intake, 
ranged from 17 to 31 sec for 15 mg b.i.d. and from 15 to 30 sec for 20 mg o.d. in this patient 
population. These ranges are very similar to PT values observed in DVT Treatment EXT patients whose 
5/95 percentiles for PT at maximum effect, 2 to 4 h after tablet intake, ranged from 16 to 33 sec for 
15 mg b.i.d. and from 15 to 30 sec for 20 mg o.d. 
When analyzing PT Neoplastin® data and their relation to important patient covariates, the previously 
established increases in PT values were observed for increasing age, decreasing body weight or 
worsening renal function (assessed via creatinine clearance). 
CHMP discussion 
The pharmacodynamic response was in line with the previously established PK/PD relation between PT 
and rivaroxaban plasma concentration. 
1.1.3.  Overvall conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Rivaroxaban is a competitive, selective, and direct oral factor Xa inhibitor. Activation of factor X to 
factor Xa plays a central role in the cascade of blood coagulation.  Inhibition of factor Xa would be 
expected to inhibit the amplified burst of thrombin generation induced when the coagulation system is 
activated both when the activation is initiated by the internal (“surface activation”) or external route 
(tissue factor and factor VIIa). 
In phase I dose escalation studies, factor Xa was inhibited in a dose-dependent way over the complete 
dose range closely following the pharmacokinetic profiles of rivaroxaban. The other global clotting tests 
PT, aPTT, and Heptest were also affected in a dose-dependent way. The 10 mg dose of rivaroxaban 
resulted in a maximal reduction of the factor Xa activity by 33% (SD 5.1%), and a maximal 
prolongation of PT of 38%. The 20 mg dose of rivaroxaban resulted in a maximal reduction of the 
factor Xa activity by 55%, and a maximal prolongation of PT of 98%. All pharmacodynamic parameters

investigated in phase I trials correlated closely with the plasma concentrations. Rivaroxaban has no 
influence on antithrombin III levels or factor II, thus supporting the direct mechanism of inhibition of 
factor Xa in humans. 
Results of investigations of the ETP (endogenous thrombin potential) have shown that single doses of 5 
and 30 mg rivaroxaban influence the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system. A dose-
dependent influence is noted on lag-time, time to peak, peak level and total amount of the endogenous 
thrombin over time curve. 
Another study identified a prolonged influence of rivaroxaban beyond 24 h on the peak level of the ETP 
as well as lag time suggesting that pharmacological effects may be present beyond 24 hours after 
doses of 20 mg. 
With regards to secondary pharmacology effects, it can be noted that neither preclinical data nor the 
dedicated QT study indicated that rivaroxaban affects QT to any clinically relevant extent. 
The food effect study results did not justified amendment to the SmPC nor the rifampicin study data.   
However the information related to moderate renal impairment was amended further request of the 
CHMP and additional analysis of the overall EINSTEIN PE and DVT data.  
From a clinical point of view, the clinical pharmacology of rivaroxaban has been well characterised. 
1.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
The current application for treatment of Pulmonary embolism and prevention of recurrent deep vein 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is based on one  phase III pivotal study  (11702PE) in  PE and 
supportive study in PE (study 11899). The data previously assessed for the treatment of DVT from 
study (11702 DVT) previously assessed in application (EMEA/H/C/00944/X10) could also be considered 
supportive but not discussed in this report.  
The following table provides an overview of the phase II and III studies supporting the current 
application.

1.2.1.2.  Results 
No clear dose response relationship could be established for efficacy parameters in any of the studies. 
In study 11223 a 30% improvement in CUS thrombus score was observed in 53, 48, 38, 52 and 40% 
in the 10mg b.i.d, 20mg b.i.d, 40mg o.d., 30mg b.i.d  and enoxaparin/VKA groups, respectively. In 
study 11528 the overall improvement rates based on CUS, PLS and symptomatic DVT were 77, 82, 74 
and 69% in the 20mg o.d., 30mg o.d., 40 mg o.d. and the enoxaparin/VKA groups, respectively. The 
lack of a clear relationship between dose and efficacy response are commonly seen in dose finding 
studies within this area. 
The doses applied in the phase III studies in DVT and PE were rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily in the 
acute phase for a total of 3 weeks followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. In the pivotal study in PE 
a dose confirmation exercise was performed. 
There was a slight tendency for increased bleeding risks with increasing doses in study 11223 with 
somewhat more bleedings with doses equal to or above 40 mg (with an incidence of 2.5% of major 
bleedings and an additional 9.5% of non major bleedings) in comparison with enoxaparin/VKA (major 
bleedings 0%, non major 6.3%). With the dose 10 mg b.i.d. the bleeding rates were similar to those in 
the enoxaparin/VKA group. In study 11528 bleeding rates were similar in all treatment groups.

Analysis 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the time to the first event of the composite primary 
description 
efficacy outcome was analyzed using a Cox’s proportional hazards model, with intended 
treatment duration as stratum and adjusted for the baseline presence of malignancy. The 
rivaroxaban-to-comparator hazard ratio was computed with two sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Based on this model, rivaroxaban was to be considered at least as effective 
as the comparator if the upper limit of the CI was less than 2.0. 
To account for multiple testing, a hierarchical testing procedure was pre-specified, and 
comprised non-inferiority and superiority testing for the primary efficacy outcome. 
Furthermore, if non-inferiority for the primary efficacy outcome was demonstrated, the 
principal safety outcome (composite of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events), as well as the major bleeding outcome were to be tested hierarchically. Secondary 
efficacy outcomes were not included in the hierarchical testing procedure. 
1.2.2.1.  Methods- analysis of data 
Study title /objective 
The phase III study 11702 PE was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, event-driven, non inferiority 
trial for efficacy in patients with acute symptomatic PE with or without symptomatic DVT.  
The primary efficacy objective for this study was to evaluate whether rivaroxaban is at least as 
effective as enoxaparin / VKA (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) in the treatment of subjects with 
acute symptomatic PE with or without symptomatic DVT for the prevention of recurrent VTE. 
The principal safety objective was the evaluation of major and clinically relevant non-major bleedings. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Subjects were eligible for study 11702 PE if they had objectively confirmed acute symptomatic PE with 
or without symptomatic DVT. The maximum treatment duration with therapeutic doses of 
anticoagulants prior to randomization was 36 hours (or 48 hours after protocol amendment 4) with the 
additional limitation that only a single dose of VKA was allowed. Subjects were potentially eligible if the 
diagnosis of PE was based on one of the following criteria: 
•  A (new) intraluminal filling defect in segmental or more proximal branches on spiral 
• 
computed tomography (sCT) scan 
•  A (new) intraluminal filling defect or an extension of an existing defect or a new sudden 
• 
cutoff of vessels more than 2.5 mm in diameter on the pulmonary angiogram 
•  A (new) perfusion defect of at least 75% of a segment with a local normal ventilation 
• 
• 
result (high-probability) on ventilation / perfusion lung scintigraphy (VPLS) 
Inconclusive sCT, pulmonary angiography, or lung scintigraphy with demonstration of DVT in the 
lower extremities by compression ultrasound (CUS) or venography 
The index event (i.e. the event for which the subject was eligible for the study) was adjudicated. The 
adjudication package contained films or images of one of the above tests, which were used only to 
confirm the initial diagnosis. A description of the procedures for these tests was provided in the 
diagnostic test manual. No systematic search for other sites of thrombosis was required. Adjudication 
was performed after randomization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013

The main exclusion criteria were  
• 
• 
• 
• 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) 
significant liver disease (or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 3 x upper limit of normal [ULN])  
short life expectancy (< 3 months)  
active bleeding or a bleeding risk contraindicating treatment with enoxaparin or VKA  
•  hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg) 
• 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to receive either rivaroxaban 15 mg b.i.d. for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg 
o.d. or the currently recommended treatment (drugs mandated: enoxaparin followed by either warfarin 
or acenocoumarol). The treatment duration was 3, 6 or 12 months, determined by the investigator 
prior to randomization, and based on the risk profile of the subject and local practice/guidelines.  
The following guidance was used: 
A 3-month treatment duration is often employed for subjects with transient risk factors such as: 
•  Recent surgery or trauma 
• 
Immobilization 
•  Use of estrogen-containing drugs 
• 
Puerperium 
A 6-month or 12-month treatment duration is often employed for subjects with idiopathic VTE, or with 
permanent risk factors such as: 
•  Active cancer 
• 
Previous episodes of DVT / PE 
•  Known thrombophilic condition (e.g. deficiency of antithrombin III, protein S or C, factor V or 
prothrombin gene mutations, or anti-phospholipid antibodies) 
The final decision to treat a subject for 3, 6, or 12 months was at the investigator’s discretion and was 
based on the above risk assessments as well as the potential for bleeding. 
Subjects allocated to the comparator group received enoxaparin b.i.d. for at least 5 days in 
combination with VKA (overlap 4 - 5 days) and continued with VKA only after the INR had been ≥2.0 
for 2 consecutive measurements at least 24 hours apart. Warfarin and acenocoumarol were allowed as 
VKAs. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE, i.e. the composite of recurrent DVT or 
non-fatal or fatal PE. The following definitions were applied by the CIAC to confirm a suspected episode 
of symptomatic recurrent DVT / PE: 
1. Suspected (recurrent) DVT with one of the following findings: 
•  Abnormal CUS where compression had been normal or, if non-compressible during screening, a 
substantial increase (4 mm or more) in diameter of the thrombus during full compression 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 15/49 
 
 
 
 
•  An extension of an intraluminal filling defect, or a new intraluminal filling defect or an extension of 
non-visualization of veins in the presence of a sudden cut-off on venography 
or 
2. Suspected PE with one of the following findings: 
•  A (new) intraluminal filling defect in segmental or more proximal branches on sCT scan 
•  A (new) intraluminal filling defect or an extension of an existing defect or a new sudden cutoff of 
vessels more than 2.5 mm in diameter on the pulmonary angiogram 
•  A (new) perfusion defect of at least 75% of a segment with a local normal ventilation result (high-
probability) on VPLS 
• 
Inconclusive sCT, pulmonary angiography, or lung scintigraphy with demonstration of DVT in the 
lower extremity 
3. Fatal PE was: 
• 
PE based on objective diagnostic testing, autopsy 
•  Death which cannot be attributed to a documented cause and for which DVT / PE cannot be ruled 
out (unexplained death) 
In the absence of objective testing, a suspected episode of DVT or PE was to be considered as 
confirmed if it led to a change in anticoagulant treatment at therapeutic dosages for more than 48 
hours. 
The secondary efficacy outcomes assessed in this study are given in the table below. 
Sample size 
Assuming equal efficacy, a total of 88 events was calculated to give a power of 90% to demonstrate 
that rivaroxaban is non-inferior to the comparator, considering a relative non-inferiority margin for the 
hazard ratio of 2.0 (2-sided α=0.05). Based on the observation that most recurrent events occur in the 
first month after the initial event, an incidence rate of recurrent VTE of 2.5% at 3 months, 3% at 6 
months, and 3.5 % at 12 months was expected. Hence, a mean incidence rate for the primary efficacy 
outcome of 3% for both treatment groups was expected and at least 1465 subjects per group were 
determined to be necessary. This number of subjects was to be adjusted based on the observed overall 
incidence rate of symptomatic recurrent VTE as follows: the number of subjects with events for the 
primary efficacy outcome within the intended treatment duration was estimated for various numbers of 
subjects to be randomized, using interim overall incidence rates and interim overall durations of 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 16/49 
 
 
 
 
 
observation by intended treatment duration. Then, a number of subjects to be randomized was 
selected that was expected to lead to approximately 88 events. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was performed centrally by an interactive voice response system (IVRS) stratified by 
country and by intended treatment duration. 
Allocation was stratified by 1) country and 2) intended treatment duration. 
Blinding (masking) 
An open label design was chosen taking the complexity of a double blind design in this setting into 
account.  
The design gave the opportunity to use the local VKA agent and it allowed subjects in the comparator 
group who present with sub-therapeutic INRs to be adjusted back into the therapeutic range while 
being protected for brief periods with a short-acting anticoagulant such as s.c. LMWH. The clinical 
evaluation of subjects with suspected outcome events frequently entails un-blinding. Subjects 
presenting to the hospital in an emergency situation, either with bleeding or a suspected thrombotic 
event, will often have the INR measured, which would potentially reveal study treatment allocation. 
Statistical methods 
The observation time relevant for the primary efficacy analysis was given by the pre-assigned intended 
treatment duration, i.e. 3, 6, or 12 months, based on the decision of the investigator prior to 
randomization.  Thus, only those VTE events which occurred during the pre-assigned intended 
treatment duration were taken into account.   
Subjects who, within the intended treatment duration, 
•did not have a VTE event  
•were lost to follow-up 
•died because of reasons other than DVT/PE, or 
•withdrew informed consent and who did not have a primary efficacy outcome 
were censored at the last day the subject had a complete assessment for study outcomes. 
A dose confirmation analysis was performed for the initial 400 PE subjects, investigating the 
combination of symptomatic recurrent VTE and asymptomatic deterioration at repeat lung imaging at 3 
weeks after start of treatment. The incidence rate of this combined outcome was compared among 
rivaroxaban and comparator subjects who had a 3 week lung imaging test or who had a symptomatic 
recurrent VTE before the planned repeat lung imaging test at 3 weeks.  he one sided 95% interval of 
the absolute difference between observed incidence rates was calculated using exact methods. Study 
11702 PE was to be continued as planned if the one-sided 95% CI of the difference of the observed 
incidence rates between rivaroxaban and comparator in the initial 400 subjects did not exceed 8.0%.  
This margin had been chosen as it was considered clinically important. The analysis was conducted by 
the independent Dose Confirmation Committee. 
There were 5 amendments to the study protocol covering both the EINSTEIN DVT Study and the 
EINSTEIN PE Study. The amendments are considered not affecting the integrity of the study. 
All patients were to have a 30 day observational period after cessation of study treatment. At the end 
of this observational period a contact was to be taken to record:

•  SAEs. including suspected bleeding and vascular events, suspected recurrent PE/DVT 
•  Anticoagulant medication and any medication given in case of a suspected VTE or bleeding 
event. 
In those patients who discontinued study medication prematurely the same observation period applied. 
CHMP comments: 
The diagnostic criteria and inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered appropriate. The 
recommendations for treatment duration provided in the guidance to the investigators are in line with 
international guidelines. 
The diagnostic criteria for recurrent VTE are considered to be appropriate. The interpretation of “Net 
clinical benefit” should be done with caution as combining major efficacy and safety end-points of 
different clinical weight may not reflect the benefit risk balance in an optimal way. 
An open label design with central blinded adjudication of the end-points may not be ideal but can be 
accepted in this setting with the arguments provided by the Sponsor. 
A CHMP scientific advice meeting was held at EMA in 2006 where the MAH presented a clinical 
development program for the “treatment and secondary prevention of VTE”.  Two open-label non-
inferiority studies in DVT (11702 DVT) and PE (11702 PE), as well as a double blind placebo controlled 
extension study (11899) were discussed.  
The CHMP expressed preference to the conduct of a double blind design for the pivotal study, however, 
difficulties in the conduct of a blinded study were acknowledged.  The MAH considered an open label 
design for the study most appropriate.  In line with the discussion at that meeting, the MAH 
implemented measures to compensate for the advantages a blinded study would have provided.  These 
included a central sponsor independent electronic randomization system, a blinded CIAC (Central 
Independent Adjudication Committee) that assessed efficacy outcomes and key safety outcomes 
according to pre-defined objective criteria. 
The following topics were also discussed at that meeting and were implemented into the study : 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
intended duration of treatment before randomization,  
exclusive use of enoxaparin followed by either warfarin or acenocoumarol as comparators,  
duration of treatment,  
definitions of the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes,  
statistical plan,  
safety outcomes,  
liver monitoring, and  
choice of dose.   
Finally, the choice for a non-inferiority margin of 1.75 for the pooled 11702 DVT and 11702 PE studies 
was discussed, including the requirement for a non-inferiority margin of 2.0 for each of the 11702 DVT 
and 11702 PE studies. 
A NI margin of 2.0 appears liberal as a doubled incidence of recurrent VTE in comparison with 
traditional treatment could hardly be accepted. However, the DVT study, which was initiated together 
with the PE study, could to some extent support an estimation of the efficacy.

In conclusion, the study programme is essentially in agreement with the recommendations given in the 
CHMP advice.

•  Participant flow  
Conduct of the study 
The vast majority of subjects (96.9% in the rivaroxaban group and 96.1% in the enoxaparin/VKA 
group;) either completed the intended treatment period, had a primary efficacy outcome, died, or 
participated in the study until recruitment was terminated by the sponsor when the required number of 
primary efficacy outcome events was expected to be reached with the subjects already in the study. 
The vast majority of the included patients completed the study as intended.

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy outcomes were primarily analyzed for the ITT population 4832 subjects overall, with 2419 
subjects in the rivaroxaban and 2413 subjects in the enoxaparin / VKA group), with supportive 
analyses performed for the PP population (4462 subjects overall, with 2224 subjects in the rivaroxaban 
and 2238 subjects in the enoxaparin / VKA group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Results of the Dose-Confirmation Analysis 
After inclusion of the initial 400 subjects in study 11702 PE (rivaroxaban group: 205; enoxaparin 
group: 195), a dose confirmation analysis was performed. This analysis was based on the composite of 
asymptomatic deterioration on ventilation/perfusion lung scan or sCT and the primary efficacy outcome 
at 3 weeks. Altogether, 379 subjects had a baseline and a repeat lung scan at 3 weeks. Of these 
subjects, 18 had a change in anticoagulant medication within 2 weeks after the date of the repeat lung 
scan (4 subjects treated with rivaroxaban and 14 subjects treated with enoxaparin/VKA).  
The incidence rate of the combination of symptomatic recurrent VTE and asymptomatic deterioration at 
repeat lung imaging at 3 weeks was 3/179 subjects (1.7%) in the rivaroxaban group and 1/175 
(0.6%) in the enoxaparin/VKA group. The upper 1-sided 95% CI of the absolute difference between 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 20/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incidence rates, as calculated using the exact methods, was 3.6% and thus did not exceed the pre-
specified value of 8.0%. 
In addition, the response to treatment was assessed based on the repeated perfusion lung scan results 
and confirmed symptomatic VTE events up to Day 26. In this assessment, 154/179 rivaroxaban 
subjects (86.0%) and 150/175 enoxaparin/VKA subjects (85.7%) were considered as having 
improved; 22/179 rivaroxaban subjects (12.3%) and 24/175 enoxaparin/VKA subjects (13.7%) were 
considered as unchanged; and 3/179 rivaroxaban subjects (1.7%) and 1/175 enoxaparin/VKA subjects 
(0.6%) were considered as deteriorated.  
The CHMP considered that the dose confirmation analyses supported continuation of the study. 
The treatment duration is given in the table 7 below: 
For rivaroxaban, compliance with the intended dose schedule was calculated based on the actual 
number of tablets taken divided by the expected number of tablet intake for the duration of 
observation from first dispense of study treatment up to the last intake of study treatment (even if it 
was discontinued prematurely). 
Overall compliance in the rivaroxaban group (Table 8)  
The CHMP agreed that treatment compliance appeared to be reasonably good in this population.

In the above table, incidence rates are given in numbers of subjects reporting the event after 
randomization up to end of intended treatment time, divided by number of subjects in reference 
population. If the same subject had several events, the subject was counted for several components so 
that numbers for the components may not add up to those for the composite outcome  
During the 30-day observational period in the ITT population, the incidence rates of the primary 
efficacy outcome were 0.9% (20 / 2211) in the rivaroxaban group and 0.7% (15 / 2201) in the 
enoxaparin / VKA group. During this period (by definition), no subjects in the rivaroxaban group took 
any rivaroxaban. In the enoxaparin / VKA group, a substantial number of subjects continued VKA 
treatment as routine anticoagulant therapy. In the rivaroxaban group, a smaller number of subjects as 
compared to the enoxaparin/VKA group received routine anticoagulation. In addition, routine 
anticoagulation in the rivaroxaban group was initiated with a delay as compared to the enoxaparin/VKA 
group. The 0.9% vs. 0.7% incidence rates compare favorably with the recurrent VTE incidence rate in 
subjects with PE and / or DVT randomized to placebo in the EINSTEIN Extension Study 11899 (1.7% 
per month).

Achievement of Target INR Range of 2.0-3.0 
The mean percentage of time subjects’ INR was inside or outside the target interval of 2.0-3.0 during 
the VKA treatment period, which was defined as the period after initiation of VKA and discontinuation 
of initial low molecular weight heparin, is summarized below. The results are given for unadjusted time 
in therapeutic range (TTR) and adjusted TTR. The adjusted time excludes  
• 
• 
• 
days where VKA was intentionally interrupted (as determined by the adjudication committee), and 
the corresponding period of 8 days after re-start of VKA 
days where any additional anticoagulant was used (including heparins, fondaparinux, other VKA), 
and 
days after primary efficacy outcome or major bleeding event was reported. 
Adjusted time was selected because this methodology was used in contemporary studies using double 
blind study medication and sham INRs.

CHMP discussion: 
The achieved INR levels are representative from a pan-European perspective and the management of 
the VKA treatment could be considered acceptable although a better performance can be expected in 
some centres and in some countries. 
There is no clear relationship between the quality of the VKA treatment and the relative efficacy of 
rivaroxaban as compared to VKA treatment even if such a relationship could theoretically be expected.

1.2.2.3.  Discussion 
The patients included in the 11702 study are considered to be reasonably representative for a 
European PE population with regards to demographic and risk factor characteristics. Approximately 60 
% of the patients were recruited within Europe. 
The number of patients lost for follow up are not high and are considered to not be of concern. 
A numerically higher incidence of the primary efficacy events were recorded in the rivaroxaban group 
with a point estimate of 1.12 and a 95% CI up to 1.68. This has been discussed in relation to the MAH 
Assessment report

responses to the List of Questions. The uncertainty introduced by the numerical differences observed 
disfavouring rivaroxaban has been satisfactorily resolved. It is acknowledged that important additional 
data for the efficacy of rivaroxaban is gained from the Einstein DVT study and the pooling of the results 
of these two studies which supports the conclusion that rivaroxaban therapy is sufficiently effective in 
DVT and PE treatment.  However, DVT and PE are to be regarded as different clinical manifestations of 
the same disease.  
Additionally, it has to be taken into account that in both studies 11702 PE and study 11702  DVT, the 
incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome was the same (2.1%) for rivaroxaban, but the incidence 
rate of the primary efficacy outcome in the enoxaparin/VKA group was significantly lower in study 
11702 PE (1.8%) than in study 11702 DVT (3.0%). The relative low event rate in the Enoxaparin/VKA 
arm in this event driven study might have also contributed to the numerical differences in this event-
driven study.” 
Considering that a higher number of patients in the rivaroxaban arm were left untreated for a period of 
time and with the well-known high risk for recurrences in a VTE population it may not be surprising 
that more patients had a recurrence in the rivaroxaban group. The issue of a possible rebound 
phenomenon has been extensively discussed in relation to previous applications and at present, there 
is no convincing evidence for such phenomenon to be present. 
1.2.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-
analysis) 
The study in DVT (11702 DVT) had a similar design as the pivotal study supporting this application 
(11702 PE). The primary efficacy outcome was the same in both studies, i.e. symptomatic recurrent 
VTE, defined as the composite of recurrent DVT, non-fatal or fatal PE, including unexplained death for 
which PE could not be ruled out. Furthermore, DVT and PE are closely related and could be seen as 
different clinical manifestations of the same disease.

CHMP discussion: 
In the DVT study a numerically better outcome with borderline significance was noted in the 
rivaroxaban group. The enoxaparin/VKA treatment appears to have been handled with similar quality 
in the two studies. The numerical increase in recurrences in the rivaroxaban has been discussed above 
and were considered satisfactorily solved in the answer to the LoQ. 
The outcome ‘net clinical benefit 1’ was the composite of the primary efficacy outcome and major 
bleeding events. In the rivaroxaban group, the incidence rate of net clinical benefit 1 was numerically 
slightly higher in study 11702 PE (3.4%) than in study 11702 DVT (2.9%); in the pooled analysis it 
was 3.2%. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, incidence rates were similar between study 11702 PE (4.0%) 
and study 11702 DVT (4.2%). Hazard ratios for rivaroxaban vs. enoxaparin/VKA were numerically in 
favor of rivaroxaban (11702 PE: 0.849; 95% CI: 0.633-1.139; p = 0.2752); for study 11702 DVT 
(0.667; 95% CI: 0.466 0.954; p = 0.027) and for the pooled analysis (0.771; 95% CI: 0.614 0.967; p 
= 0.0244). 
The outcome ‘net clinical benefit 2’, which was a post-hoc analysis, was the composite of the primary 
efficacy outcome, major bleeding events, cardiovascular deaths, myocardial infarctions, strokes, and 
non-CNS systemic embolisms. In the rivaroxaban group, the incidence rate of net clinical benefit 2 was 
numerically higher in study 11702 PE (4.5%) than in study 11702 DVT (3.6%); in the pooled analysis 
it was 4.1%. In the enoxaparin/VKA group, incidence rates were similar between study 11702 PE 
(4.8%) and study 11702 DVT (4.7%). Hazard ratios for rivaroxaban vs. enoxaparin/VKA were 
numerically in favor of rivaroxaban (11702 PE: 0.940, 95% CI: 0.724-1.221; 11702 DVT: 0.727, 95% 
CI: 0.522 1.013; pooled analysis: 0.853, 95% CI: 0.695-1.047). 
CHMP discussion:  
The CHMP agreed that the pooled analyses of “net clinical outcome” are in favour of rivaroxaban as 
compared to enoxaparin/VKA treatment.

1.2.4.  Supportive study (study 11899)  
Study 11899 which was conducted to provide evidence for the benefit of continued treatment with 
rivaroxaban vs. placebo in patients who had completed anticoagulant therapy and for whom clinical 
equipoise had been reached.  Subjects who completed 6 or 12 months of treatment in either study 
11702 DVT or 11702 PE or from outside of these two studies were recruited to study 11899. 
The results of study 11899, which has previously been assessed by the CHMP (refer to procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000944/X10) demonstrated a high rate of recurrent VTE in the placebo group, a statistical 
significant and clinically relevant risk reduction of recurrent VTE in favour of rivaroxaban . The 
comparison of rivaroxaban vs. placebo treatment yielded a hazard ratio of 0.185 (95% CI 0.087-0.393, 
p < 0.0001) or a 81% relative risk reduction The study provides additional support for the efficacy of 
rivaroxaban in secondary prevention of PE. 
1.2.5.  CHMP overall conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal non-inferiority study in treatment and secondary prophylaxis of PE included patients 
considered to be representative for a European PE population.  
The open label design is not ideal but can be accepted taking the central blinded evaluation of the end-
points into account. The study was considered well performed with an acceptable quality of the 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment in the comparator group with an adjusted mean TTR of 63%. The number 
of patients lost for follow-up was small.  
The incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome (ITT population) until the end of intended treatment 
was 2.1% (50/2419) in the rivaroxaban group and 1.8% (44/2413) in the enoxaparin/VKA group 
yielding a hazard ratio of 1.123 (95% CI: 0.749-1.684) in the ITT population. The study met its 
primary objective as the upper limit of the confidence interval was below the pre defined non-
inferiority margin of 2.0. Similar results were obtained in the PP population. The results were 
consistent in different relevant subgroups. 
The predefined delta of <2.0 for the NI appeared liberal in this disease where VTE recurrences can be 
life-threatening and otherwise may have major clinical consequences for the patents with a need for 
long-term  anticoagulant treatment and risks for post-thrombotic syndromes and chronic pulmonary 
hypertension. It should however be remembered that the absolute recurrence rates were low in the 
study and that enoxaparin/warfarin treatment is very effective in this setting. Few prospective 
randomised studies of this size have been performed in PE. The provided pivotal study is one of the 
largest prospective comparative studies in PE ever performed.  
Numerically, a higher incidence of the primary efficacy end-point was noted in the rivaroxaban group 
and the 95% CI indicated that an increased relative risk for recurrences of approximately 70% could 
be at hand comparing with conventional treatment. It could, however, be argued that the claimed non-
inferiority in the pivotal PE study is supported by the more favourable results of the DVT study. It can 
be said that DVT and PE are different clinical manifestations of the same underlying disease and 
traditionally they are treated in the same way if anticoagulants are used.  
Further support for the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the prevention of PE is provided in study 11899 which 
was a double-blind and placebo-controlled trial performed in a population that had VTE but was not 
considered to necessarily be in need of prolonged anticoagulant treatment.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the study 11702 PE, together with the additional supportive 
data and analysis provided sufficient evidence for efficacy for the treatment of PE and secondary 
prevention of PE in adult patients.

1.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
1.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The results of the pooled 11702 PE and 11702 DVT studies are presented to enable a comparison of 
the data and to demonstrate their consistency especially for the clinically meaningful bleeding events 
(primary and secondary safety outcomes). This is considered acceptable by the CHMP and is justified 
by the fact that subject characteristics were similar with similar incidence rates of adverse events. As 
DVT and PE are considered to be manifestations of the same disease, albeit of different severity, and 
are treated in the same way, it was considered medically appropriate to pool results from studies 
11702 DVT and PE in several analyses.

The presentation of safety data refered to treatment-emergent adverse events unless otherwise 
stated.   
Bleeding events are presented as bleeding events confirmed by the CIAC (Central Independent 
Adjudication Committee) unless otherwise stated. The treatment-emergent period for bleeding events 
was defined as the period starting after randomization and ending 2 days after stop of medication. 
The principal safety outcome was the composite of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
events.   
The secondary safety outcome was major bleeding events.

The term "treatment-emergent" as used in this document refers to the period from randomization until 2 days after the last dose of 
study drug. 
The incidence rates of all adverse events were higher in study 11702 PE (about 80%) than in study 
11702 DVT (about 64%), which may be explained by the sicker study population in the PE study (as 
indicated by the different prevalence rates of co-morbidities) and the longer treatment duration.  The 
incidence rates were comparable between the treatment groups for the PE and DVT studies.  
Therefore, the incidence rates were similar (about 74%) for both treatment groups in the pooled 
analysis.

vs. 4.1% [169/4116] enoxaparin/VKA) were seen in the pooled analysis compared to the individual 
studies. 
Deaths  
The incidence rate of death within the study period was numerically higher in the rivaroxaban group 
(2.6% [63/2412]) than in the enoxaparin/VKA group (2.1% [51/2405]).  In both treatment groups, 
the 3 most frequently reported primary causes for death were: cancer (0.9% [22/2412] rivaroxaban 
vs. 1.0% [23/2405] enoxaparin/VKA), infectious disease (0.4% [9/2412] rivaroxaban vs. 0.2% 
[6/2405] enoxaparin/VKA), and unexplained death for which PE could not be ruled out (0.3% [8/2412] 
rivaroxaban vs. 0.2% [6/2405] enoxaparin/VKA). 
In the safety population of the 11702 PE and the 11702 DVT studies, the number of subjects who died 
after randomization was balanced between the rivaroxaban and the enoxaparin/VKA groups across 
both studies (2.6% [63/2412] rivaroxaban vs. 2.1% [51/2405] enoxaparin/VKA in 11702 PE study; 
2.4% [41/1718] rivaroxaban vs. 3.0% [52/1711] enoxaparin/VKA in 11702 DVT study).  The primary 
causes of deaths were similar in both 11702 PE and 11702 DVT.

Adverse Events of Interest (Bleeding) 
The definition of major bleeding events used in the EINSTEIN study program is consistent with the 
definition of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.  
The CIAC (central Independent Adjudication committee) categorized the bleeding events as major, 
clinically relevant non-major or trivial. 
A major bleeding event was defined as overt bleeding 
• 
• 
• 
• 
associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more or 
leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood or 
that occurred in a critical site: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra articular, 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal or 
contributing to death. 
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding events were defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria 
for major bleeding event but associated with 
•  medical intervention or 
•  unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician or 
• 
• 
• 
(temporary) cessation of study treatment or 
discomfort for the subject such as pain or 
impairment of activities of daily life. 
Examples of such clinically relevant non-major bleeding events were: 
• 
• 
epistaxis if it lasted for more than 5 minutes, if it was repetitive (i.e. 2 or more episodes of true 
bleeding, i.e. not spots on a handkerchief, within 24 hours), or led to an intervention (e.g. packing, 
electrocoagulation), or 
gingival bleeding if it occurred spontaneously (i.e. unrelated to tooth brushing or eating), or if it 
lasted for more than 5 minutes, or 
•  hematuria if it was macroscopic, and either spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after 
instrumentation (e.g. catheter placement or surgery) of the urogenital tract, or 
•  macroscopic gastro-intestinal hemorrhage: at least one episode of melena/hematemesis, if 
clinically apparent, or 
• 
rectal blood loss, if more than a few spots, or 
•  hemoptysis, if more than a few speckles in the sputum, or 
• 
• 
intramuscular hematoma, or  
subcutaneous hematoma if the size was larger than 25 cm2, or larger than 100 cm2 if provoked, 
or 
•  multiple source bleeding. 
All other overt bleeding episodes not meeting the criteria for clinically relevant bleeding were classified 
as trivial bleeding events.

The principal safety outcome in study 11702 PE was the composite of treatment-emergent major 
bleeding events and other clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. 
The incidences of the primary safety end-point and major bleedings in the PE and DVT studies and in 
the pooled analyses are given in the tables below

And < 50 mL/min: 12.4% (26/209) rivaroxaban vs. 17.7% (34/192) enoxaparin/VKA 
Fragile subjects: Fragile subjects were defined as having an age >75 years or body weight ≤ 50 kg or 
calculated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min. 
The incidence rate for the principal safety outcome for subjects with status: 
fragile: 12.6% (64/508) rivaroxaban vs. 16.8% (80/476) enoxaparin/VKA and 
non-fragile: 9.7% (185/1904) rivaroxaban vs. 10.1% (194/1929) enoxaparin/VKA 
A total of 33.3% (802/2412) subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group and in 33.6% (807/2405) 
subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group had investigator-assessed, treatment-emergent 
bleeding events; most of them were assessed by the investigators as drug-related.   
Investigator reported serious treatment-emergent bleeding AEs occurred in 3.9% (94/2412) 
rivaroxaban treated subjects vs. 4.6% (111/2405) enoxaparin/VKA treated subjects. 
Hepatic events 
The incidence rates of post-baseline ALT >3 x ULN were lower with rivaroxaban treatment (1.9% 
[45/2351]) than with enoxaparin/VKA treatment (3.0% [70/2324]).

When looking at the incidence rates of AEs identified using SMQ for hepatic disorders with an incidence 
rate of at least 0.5%, overall, 8.3% (199/2412) of the subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group 
had hepatic disorder events compared with 12.4% (299/2405) subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA 
treatment group.  The majority of hepatic disorder AEs were laboratory abnormalities, which occurred 
in 5.3% (128/2412) of the subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group compared with 9.2% 
(222/2405) subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group. 
Overall, 1.0% (23/2412) of the subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group experienced hepatic 
serious TEAEs compared with 1.5% (36/2405) subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group. 
The Hepatic Event Assessment Committee were sent 36 cases in study 11702 PE for review with the 
number of cases balanced between the 2 treatment groups overall (19 rivaroxaban, 17 
enoxaparin/VKA). No cases were given a definite causality assessment by any reviewer. 
The case narratives have been provided. The CHMP agreed with the MAH that the reported data do not 
indicate a clear signal for hepatic toxicity. 
Cardiovascular events 
The incidence rates of cardiovascular events were equally distributed between the treatment group,see

Acute pancreatitis was reported as TEAE with an incidence rate of none for subjects in the rivaroxaban 
treatment group and <0.1% (1/2405) for subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group in the PE 
study. 
Renal failure was reported as TEAE with an incidence rate of <0.1% (2/2412) in the rivaroxaban 
treatment group compared to 0.1% (3/2405) in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group in the Einstein 
PE trial. 
Overall, anaphylactic reactions/severe cutaneous reactions were reported as TEAE with an incidence 
rate of 0.12% (5/4130) for subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 0.15% (6/4116) for 
subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group in the DVT and pool analysis. 
1.3.2.4.  Laboratory findings 
Thrombocytopenia was reported as TEAE with an incidence rate of 0.1% (3/2412) in the rivaroxaban 
treatment group compared to 0.3% (7/2405) in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group in the Einstein 
PE trial. 
1.3.2.5.  Immunological events 
Overall, anaphylactic reactions/severe cutaneous reactions were reported as TEAE with an incidence 
rate of 0.12% (5/4130) for subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 0.15% (6/4116) for 
subjects in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group 
1.3.2.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Examples of performed exploratory analyses of co-medication are given below :

Treatment with statins at baseline: 2.1% (8/380) rivaroxaban vs. 3.3% (12/362) enoxaparin/VKA in 
subjects treated with statins, and 0.9% (18/2032) rivaroxaban vs. 2.0% ( 40/2043) enoxaparin/VKA in 
subjects not treated with statins had a major bleeding event. 
Treatment with ASA at baseline: 1.2% (3/253) rivaroxaban vs. 5.1% (12/235) enoxaparin/VKA in 
subjects treated with ASA, and 1.1% (23/2159) rivaroxaban vs. 1.8% (40/2170) enoxaparin/VKA not 
treated with ASA had a major bleeding event. 
Treatment with NSAIDs at baseline: 1.7% (4/240) rivaroxaban vs. 3.5% (8/230) enoxaparin/VKA in 
subjects treated with NSAIDs and 1.0% (22/2172) rivaroxaban vs. 2.0% (44/2175) enoxaparin/VKA in 
subjects not treated with NSAIDs had a major bleeding event. 
Treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors at baseline: 1.3% (2/153) rivaroxaban vs. 4.8% (8/165) 
enoxaparin/VKA in subjects treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors and 1.1% (24/2259) rivaroxaban vs. 2.0% 
(44/2240) enoxaparin/VKA in subjects not treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors had a major bleeding event. 
Thus, major bleeding events were consistently lower in these groups on treatment with rivaroxaban 
than on treatment with enoxaparin/VKA, however given the limited number of subjects in each co–
medication group no final interpretation of the data can be drawn from this exploratory analyses.  
In summary, for the following co-medications, no firm conclusions can be drawn due to the low 
number of subjects having received the respective co-medication at baseline: clopidogrel/ ticlopidine 
(31 subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 34 in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group); 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: 25 subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 29 in the 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment group), and P-gp inhibitors (62 subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group 
and 59 in the enoxaparin/VKA treatment group). 
The CHMP  agreed with the MAH that there are no indications that the combination of these medicines 
with rivaroxaban would increase bleeding rates to a larger extent than the combination with 
enoxa/VKA. 
1.3.2.7.  Discontinuation due to AES 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug 
The incidence rate of AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug was higher in the 
rivaroxaban group (5.1% in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 4.1% in the enoxaparin/VKA 
treatment group)

The incidence of AEs leading to hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization was in the range of 17% in

1.3.2.8.  Post marketing experience 
The results of an interim analysis of the XAMOS study 13802 were assessed in relation to the 
application for DVT treatment.  As of data base lock of this submission on 31 Dec 2011, no new data 
were available. 
The experience with rivaroxaban from spontaneous reporting is generally consistent with the 
experience from clinical studies.  No new specific safety concerns are judged to be derived from these 
data. 
1.3.3.  Discussion 
When the DVT and PE studies are pooled, the incidences of adverse events are similar between the 
treatment groups. 
The number of patients are considered sufficient by the CHMP for assessment of the safety profile 
taking also the experience from other indications into account. 
With regards to serious adverse events, referring to previous studies in DVT and atrial fibrillation, there 
is a tendency for more mucosal bleedings in the rivaroxaban group (anaemia, rectal bleeding, uterine 
bleeding, epistaxis). For rivaroxaban-treated women aged < 55 years, a higher rate of uterine bleeding 
events (predominantly menstrual bleeding) was observed when compared to enoxaparin/VKA 
treatment. The majority of these events occurred during the initial treatment phase (i.e., in the first 30 
days) and generally the subjects continued their treatment. In summary, the current information in the 
SmPC is adequate and remains unchanged.  
The numerically slightly higher mortality in the rivaroxaban arm in the PE study was noted. However, 
there was no indication that this slight imbalance is related to the different anticoagulant regimens 
when looking at the narratives and the reported causes for death. Further discussion within this 
procedure, the CHMP considered this not to be of concern for the proposed indication.  
A higher incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was noted in the rivaroxaban group, but there 
are no clear differences in the patterns of reasons for these withdrawals between the study groups. 
Therefore, it was not considered to be of concern by the CHMP.

With regards to bleeding, the bleeding rates by subgroups were consistently lower in the rivaroxaban 
group. The lower overall incidences of major bleedings and of intracranial and retroperitoneal bleedings 
in the rivaroxaban groups may represent an important clinical advantage.  
1.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database for acute treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE contains over 4000 patients 
included in the phase II and III studies. Thus the experience should be sufficient to capture common 
adverse events and to characterise bleeding risks in the target population. The reported incidence of 
major or clinically relevant bleedings was not increased as compared to enoxaparin/VKA treatment. As 
noted earlier the bleeding pattern seems to differ from what was seen during VKA treatment with a 
higher incidence of uterine and GI bleedings but with a lower incidence of intracranial bleedings. This 
has been extensively discussed in previous applications and may be related to the different 
mechanisms of action.  
There are no indications that treatment with rivaroxaban would be associated with severe hepatic 
adverse events thrombocytopenia or pancreatic adverse reactions in the proposed new indication. The 
post-marketing experience from the approved indications has so far not revealed any safety concerns 
resulting in regulatory actions. 
1.4.  PSUR cycle 
This new indication does not require a need to change the PSUR cycle.  
1.5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure. 
The update of the EU-RMP has been performed to support the submission for the new proposed 
indication: treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) and PE in adults. The RMP was subsequently updated during the procedure upon CHMP request.  
The data presented didn’t reveal any new important safety issues that require an update of the Safety 
Specifications. 
The already proposed drug utilisation studies have been amended to include the PE indication, which is 
agreed. However, it seems acceptable to also include PE treatment in the modified PEM (prescription 
event monitoring) and SCEM (specialist cohort event monitoring) epidemiological studies, to provide 
further safety information in this indication as proposed by the MAH. 
No new risk minimisation activities in addition to those already being performed were requested by the 
CHMP. However, the CHMP requested the MAH to insert the Patient Alert Card into the labelling to 
better ensure that appropriate information is provided to all patients treated with Xarelto.  
The prescriber guide (assessed in earlier RMPs) has been updated, to include PE treatment, which is 
acceptable.

1.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the initial PI submitted by the MAH.  
Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for the 15 mg and 20 mg strengths 
are introduced and discussed in the scientific part. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated 
accordingly. 
The summary of changes introduced is as follows.  For the complete changes introduced please refer to 
the PI provided in attachment of this report. 
The new indication, combined with the existing DVT indication, is the following:  
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients.) 
The posology section is amended to provide information relative to dosage in PE and amendment for 
moderate renal impairment is introduced for both PE and DVT treatments.  
Upon request of the CHMP, the information related to bleeding was updated in section 4.3 and 4.4 to 
provide more detailed information and harmonise with other anticoagulants of the same class.  
A warning for haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or 
pulmonary embolectomy is introduced in section 4.4. 
Section 4.8 was updated with the additional safety data from clinical trials and subsequent change in 
section 4.7 is introduced.

Update of section 5.1 with data provided from the clinical trials previously described.  
In addition during the procedure, the CHMP requested the MAH to insert the Patient Alert Card into the 
labelling to better ensure that appropriate information is provided to all patients treated with Xarelto. 
The content of the Patient Alert Card was previously agreed and handled at national level.  
Following the introduction of the new indication, the annex II has been amended, and reference to the 
Patient alert Card is introduced as now part of the labelling. 
In conclusion, in this variation amendments to the Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet have been introduced. 
2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
This application is supported by one pivotal open-label non-inferiority study (study 11702), which was 
well designed and well performed. The study population was considered sufficiently representative of 
the European target PE population with regards to demographic characteristics, concomitant diseases 
and VTE risk factors. The endpoints are in line with the CHMP recommendations regarding pulmonary 
embolism. The methodology used in the pivotal study was considered acceptable. Measures were 
undertaken to reduce the potential for bias, all predefined efficacy and safety end-points were 
adjudicated centrally and the patients were followed on regular intervals with instructions to the 
investigators to evaluate key symptoms of possible outcome events.  The incidence rate of the primary 
efficacy outcome (ITT population) until the end of intended treatment was 2.1% (50/2419) in the 
rivaroxaban group and 1.8% (44/2413) in the enoxaparin/VKA group yielding a hazard ratio of 1.123 
(95% CI: 0.749-1.684) in the ITT population. The results were consistent with per protocol analyses 
and the secondary efficacy end-points supported the primary outcome. Consistency in the results was 
also obtained in important subgroups such as different age, gender, risk factors etc.  
The claimed non-inferiority as compared to enoxaparin/VKA treatment is supported by favourable 
results of the DVT study which had an almost identical design and where rivaroxaban was convincingly 
demonstrated to be non-inferior with a hazard ratio of 0.680 (95% CI: 0.443-1.042). This is 
acceptable as DVT and PE can be seen as different clinical manifestations of the same underlying 
disease, managed traditionally in the same way for the use of anticoagulant therapy. 
The supportive study (study 11899) comparing rivaroxaban with placebo in secondary VTE prevention 
in patients that had either rivaroxaban or VKA was designed as a double blind study. It provided 
convincing evidence in qualitative terms of the efficacy of rivaroxaban in the secondary prevention 
after acute VTE. The same composite efficacy end-point as in the pivotal study 11702 was used. 
Superior efficacy of rivaroxaban therapy over placebo was demonstrated with a hazard ratio of 0.185 
(95% CI 0.087-0.393, p < 0.0001) or a 81% relative risk reduction.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The predefined delta of <2.0 for the NI may appear liberal in this disease where VTE recurrences can 
be life-threatening otherwise with major clinical consequences with a need for long-term anticoagulant 
treatment for the patient with subsequent risk for post-thrombotic syndromes and chronic pulmonary 
hypertension. It should however be highlighted that the absolute recurrence rates were low in the 
study and that enoxaparin/warfarin treatment is very effective in this setting. Furthermore, it should 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 46/49 
 
 
 
 
be recognised that the statistical considerations resulted in one of the largest prospective controlled PE 
studies ever performed. 
Numerically a higher incidence of the primary efficacy end-point was noted in the rivaroxaban group 
and the 95% CI indicates an increased relative risk for recurrences of approximately 70% as compared 
with conventional treatment which would be potentially difficult to accept. This was extensively 
discussed and it was finally agreed that the absolute numbers of recurrences were low and the results 
together with external support showed that rivaroxaban is effective in this setting. Much higher rates 
would be expected if it would be ethically possible to follow a placebo treated group of patients. 
Nevertheless, even if the point estimate of the difference in recurrence rate between the study groups 
was low, with 0.23 % higher rate in the rivaroxaban arm, it can be noted that the upper 95% CI was 
1.02 % during median treatment duration of 8.6 months. Such an increase would appear potentially 
difficult to accept if external support for efficacy was lacking and if no better safety profile were shown.  
External support was provided by the results in the DVT study and some advantages with regards to 
safety are further discussed below.  
Additionally, it has to be taken into account that, the incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome 
was the same (2.1%) for rivaroxaban in both studies (11702 PE and study 11702  DVT), but the 
incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome in the enoxaparin/VKA group was significantly lower in 
study 11702 PE (1.8%) than in study 11702 DVT (3.0%). The relative low event rate in the 
Enoxaparin/VKA arm in this event driven study might have also contributed to the difficulties in 
concluding on non-inferiority in this event-driven study.  
Uncertainties on efficacy are related to fact that the application is supported on only one pivotal open-
labelled non-inferiority study. However, the study was well performed and the results are considered to 
be sufficiently robust including adequate blinded central adjudication. 
PE patients have a somewhat more severe prognosis and it can be assumed that on average the 
thrombotic burden in symptomatic PE is higher than in DVT. However, the different manifestations of 
VTE are treated similarly and the results of the DVT study provided important additional information for 
the current applied indication. From an efficacy perspective the provided data for long-term treatment 
is judged to be sufficient. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The most important observed adverse reactions are bleedings. The incidence of major bleedings was 
numerically lower in the rivaroxaban treated group as compared with the enoxaparin/VKA treated. 
Importantly, the number of intracranial bleeding was lower than in the enoxaparin/warfarin group. This 
finding was consistent with what has been observed for rivaroxaban and other new anticoagulants.  
The bleeding pattern seemed to differ to some extent from what is seen during VKA treatment with a 
higher incidence of uterine and GI bleeding. However, this is adequately addressed in the product 
information. 
There are no indications from the clinical studies performed in the proposed new indication that 
treatment with rivaroxaban would be associated with severe hepatic adverse events or induce 
thrombocytopenia or pancreatic adverse reactions. 
The bleeding risks are judged to be adequately addressed in the SmPC. In addition, harmonisation with 
other anticoagulants is also introduced with more detailed information introduced in the Product 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 47/49 
 
 
 
 
information. An unfavourable aspect with rivaroxaban treatment is the lack of a specific antidote. The 
MAH has an on-going development programme for an antidote on which CHMP advice has been given.  
Finally, it needs to be clarified that Xarelto should not be used in haemodynamically unstable PE 
patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. A clear warning has been 
implemented and reference is also introduced in the indication section. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Haemoglobin or haematocrit levels were not monitored in the phase III trial after week 4. However, 
they were monitored more intensively in the phase II study TIMI-46 and no major differences were 
seen between the treatment groups. 
The overall the safety database from long-term treatment is still limited. Many of the patients treated 
for secondary prophylaxis of VTE can be expected to be treated for many years. This is adequately 
addressed in the updated risk management plan in particular with regards to bleeding risks and 
unexpected adverse events during prolonged treatment.  
Benefit risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
One could question whether the open labelled comparative non inferiority study resulting in a 
numerically slightly higher incidence of recurrences in the rivaroxaban arm and with a CI indicating a 
possibly 70% relative increase of such events provided sufficient evidence of efficacy. However, the 
MAH has demonstrated that the difference of the observed absolute risk between study arms was low 
(0.25%) with an upper 95% CI of 1.02%. There was also important additional data from the DVT 
study, where a clearly lower incidence of recurrences in comparison with conventional treatment was 
observed. Furthermore, the potential safety advantages of an oral anticoagulant and the convenience 
with the proposed regimen are important. 
The safety profile of rivaroxaban in this setting compared with VKA treatment indicated a favourable 
decreased risk for major bleedings, intracranial bleedings and possibly bleedings into critical organs. 
This outweighs the observed increased bleeding risk for uterine, GI bleedings and anaemia provided 
that the patients are adequately clinically monitored.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The new indication for treatment of pulmonary embolism and prevention of recurrent pulmonary 
embolism is based on only one pivotal well designed study showing non-inferiority as compared to 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment. However, these data were also supported by favourable results of the DVT 
study with almost identical design and where rivaroxaban was convincingly demonstrated to be non-
inferior with a hazard ratio of 0.680 (95% CI: 0.443-1.042). This was considered acceptable as DVT 
and PE can be seen as different clinical manifestations of the same underlying disease, managed in the 
same way with regards to the use of anticoagulant therapy. 
The only available major alternative for oral long term secondary prophylaxis after PE today is VKA 
treatment from which experience exists since several decades. VKA treatment requires continuous 
monitoring and careful consideration of numerous possibilities for interaction with other drugs and 
food. The quality of VKA treatment is varying between centres. Lower quality has been associated with 
increased risks for bleeding and VTE recurrences. A simpler and more predictable alternative for oral 
Assessment report  
EMA/56019/2013 
Page 48/49 
 
 
 
 
use that would not need such intense monitoring is therefore a valuable alternative, especially for 
patients where VKA treatment is not functioning well.  
VKA therapy, if well performed, is very effective in preventing recurrences after an acute PE. From a 
pragmatic point of view recurrences hardly occur if INR values are kept within the therapeutic range 
unless there is an underlying malignancy.  
The safety profile of rivaroxaban indicated a favourable decreased risk for major bleedings, intracranial 
bleedings and possibly bleedings into critical organs in comparison with VKA therapy. This outweighs 
the observed increased bleeding risk for uterine, GI bleedings and anaemia observed provided that the 
patients are adequately clinically monitored.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that overall Benefit risk of rivaroxaban is positive for the treatment 
of pulmonary embolism and prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism in adult patients.

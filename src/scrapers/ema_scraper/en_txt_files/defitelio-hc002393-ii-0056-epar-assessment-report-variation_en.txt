1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Gentium S.r.l. submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 11 May 2021 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

submitted by the MAH where significant assessment is 
required 
Submission of the final report from study 15-007 listed as a specific obligation in the Annex II of the 
Product Information. This is a phase 3, randomised, adaptive study (15-007) of Defibrotide vs. best 
supportive care in the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in adult and paediatric patients 
undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The RMP version 9 has also been submitted.  
The MAH has also taken the opportunity to align the PI to the latest QRD template 10.2 which replaces 
the United Kingdom with United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) in the PIL.  
In addition, the MAH is correcting the following errata during the linguistic review of the PI: correction 
of the paragraph number for Regulation (EC) No 726.2004 which was cited incorrectly in Annex II of 
the French PI and formatting updates to Norwegian and Swedish language PIs. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling 
and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Defitelio (defibrotide) was granted an MA under exceptional circumstances in 2013 after a re-
examination procedure, based on retrospective data and small prospective studies with historical 
controls, for the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also known as sinusoidal 
obstruction syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy in adults, 
adolescents, children and infants over 1 month of age. VOD/SOS belongs to a group of transplant-
related, systemic endothelial diseases and is a potentially life-threatening complication of HSCT, 
triggered by several factors including toxicity of the conditioning regimen. With the MA, one specific 
obligation (SOB) of a Post-Approval Safety Study (PASS) was agreed, however, this PASS was found 
not feasible, and a new list of SOBs were agreed within procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0027, see 
section 5 for full list of SOBs. 
The new SOB 1, which is a Category 2 study and the scope for this procedure, reads: “In order to 
collect comparative safety data, the MAH will provide the final CSR and a report of comparative safety 
data from the Phase 3, randomised, adaptive study (15-007) of Defibrotide vs best supportive care in 
the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in adult and paediatric patients undergoing 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The report will also reflect on the safety data being 
collected during prophylactic treatment, and any potential safety differences related to the difference 
in indication (i.e., treatment vs prophylactic therapy).” The safety concerns addressed by this study 
are Haemorrhage, Hypotension, Coagulopathy, Immunogenicity, Thromboembolic events, Patients 
treated concomitantly with defibrotide and medications that increase the risk of haemorrhage

(including the newer oral anti-coagulants direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors), Patients with pre-
existing liver or severe renal insufficiency (aetiologies other than VOD) and Patients with intrinsic lung 
disease.  
The MAH proposed initially to update the product information Annex II by removing this study from the 
list of SOBs and to update the RMP accordingly. No other significant changes to the product 
information were proposed by the MAH. Within subsequent rounds, however, an update of 5.1 has also 
been included. Although use of defibrotide for prophylaxis of VOD is not covered by the approved 
indication, the prophylaxis studies contain paediatric data and are thus to be included in section 5.1. 
Study 15-007 was a randomised open-label study aimed at assessing the prophylactic effect of adding 
defibrotide to standard of care in a population (adults and children >1 month of age) undergoing HSCT 
with assumed (very) high risk of VOD. Prevention of VOD is not an approved indication for Defitelio. 
However, subjects included who developed VOD based on investigators judgement would receive 
defibrotide as rescue treatment, which is according to the label albeit for severe VOD only. The study 
was stopped after an interim analysis based on futility; 372 subjects were randomised which was in 
line with the originally anticipated study size. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 post-HSCT) was not met; there was 
no preventive effect of defibrotide on VOD-free survival day 30+ post-HSCT in the defibrotide group as 
compared to best supportive care. There was a numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care; 
this was particularly pronounced in the paediatric population. In the overall ITT population, VOD/death 
occurred in 50/190 subjects in the defibrotide arm (26.3%) and 40/182 subjects in the BSC arm 
(22%). The KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs) at Day +30 post-HSCT in the defibrotide arm 
vs the BSC arm were 66.8% (57.8%, 74.4%) and 72.5% (62.3%, 80.4%), respectively. In the 
paediatric population, VOD/death occurred in 32/104 subjects in the defibrotide arm (30.8%) and 
20/94 subjects in the BSC arm (21.3%). The KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs) at Day +30 
post-HSCT in the paediatric defibrotide arm vs the BSC arm were 62.5% (95% CI 50.2%, 72.5%) and 
75.0% (95% CI 63.7%, 83.2%), respectively. There were 10 deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT in the 
defibrotide group and 5 in the best supportive care group. Of these, 6 were paediatric participants 
(defibrotide group, n=4; best supportive care group, n=2), and 9 were adult participants (defibrotide 
group n=6; best supportive care group, n=3). 
One strength of study 15-007 as compared to previous defibrotide studies was the independent 
blinded assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a discrepancy between the 
blinded, independent assessment of VOD and investigator’s assessment of VOD. This discrepancy has 
been explained by the MAH in that the blinded independent assessment of VOD was inaccurate. 
Notably, both investigators and the blinded independent assessment of VOD relied on the modified 
Seattle criteria, which appears reasonable to use also in a retrospective assessment of data given that 
appropriate data are provided for the assessment; since this appears to have been the case, the MAH 
view is not found justified. Patients diagnosed as VOD by the EPAC only, and not receiving ‘rescue 
treatment’ with defibrotide had a clearly more favourable outcome regarding mortality. The MAH 
argumentation that those diagnosed by the EPAC actually did not have VOD or had very mild VOD 
translating into a better prognosis as compared to more severe VOD as diagnosed by investigators, 
has not been supported by actual clinical data. Thus, no firm conclusions can be drawn, and it is not 
likely that additional analyses could be of value. Notably, the discordance between investigators and 
the EPAC may not only be accounted for by the investigator being close to the patient, as argued by 
the MAH, but also by an underlying bias resulting from investigators being non-blinded to study 
treatment. 
Overall, the safety data from study 15-007 that are considered of most relevance are the data from 
the prophylaxis period when defibrotide was administered to subjects in the defibrotide arm (up to Day 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 8/194 
 
 
 
+30 post-HSCT), and the data from the rescue treatment period (when subjects diagnosed as VOD by 
investigators received defibrotide). Serious treatment-related TEAEs during both the prophylaxis and 
treatment periods include bleeding events, which is expected given the known safety profile of 
defibrotide. For mortality, the numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care regarding VOD-
free mortality was considered to potentially be of relevance also for the approved indication, since the 
population studied is similar to the population covered by the approved indication. Further, the aim of 
this study as outlined in the list of SOBs was also to assess any potential safety differences related to 
the difference in indication (I e, treatment vs prophylactic therapy). An in-depth discussion was 
requested in previous rounds to address the safety profile and the apparent imbalance in mortality 
with defibrotide treatment also in relation to the approved indication, with a separate discussion on the 
paediatric population regarding survival. In that respect, non-relapse mortality (which was a secondary 
endpoint in study 15-007, pertaining to those with malignant disease at baseline which was the vast 
majority of study participants) was found worrisome in that 22 of 147 participants (15.0%) in the 
defibrotide prophylaxis arm and 11 of 139 participants (7.9%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM by 
Day +100 post-HSCT. All subjects in the rescue phase received defibrotide, therefore, the impact of 
the initial randomised groups is less clear, however, it is noted that TEAEs with a fatal outcome 
occurred in 12 participants (12/25; 48.0%) in the originally randomised defibrotide arm and 8 
participants (8/31; 25.8%) in the originally randomised best supportive care arm. No satisfying 
explanation for these findings has been provided. 
Notably, also in the previous randomised defibrotide prophylaxis study (paediatric study 2004, 
assessed within the MA procedure) a higher death rate in the defibrotide arm compared to the control 
arm was noted. The higher death rate when children who did not develop VOD received defibrotide 
were compared with subjects in the control arm who did not develop VOD remained unexplained. An 
indication for prophylaxis of VOD was sought within the MA procedure, but the B/R was found negative 
based on study 2004. An extensive off-label use has been reported in previous procedures; in study DF 
VOD-2013-03-REG, a European observational registry study assessed within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0048, it was found that the majority of subjects included were treated with 
Defitelio off-label, primarily for prophylaxis of VOD (76/176 or 43%) and for non-severe VOD. Also in 
PSURs and in the DEFIFrance registry (final study report currently assessed within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0048), a large proportion of off-label use for prophylaxis of VOD has previously 
been reported. 
The B/R balance of defibrotide for prevention of VOD is found clearly negative based on study 15-007. 
Formally, the SOB relating to this study has been fulfilled. For the safety concerns addressed by this 
study, overall, no firm conclusions can be drawn; however, no new safety concerns have been 
identified. The Rapporteur also proposes that the EPAR should be publicly available after finalisation of 
this procedure. 
Finally, given the shown lack of efficacy for prevention of VOD and taking the established safety profile 
into account, the well documented off label use in the prophylactic setting (See also 
EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0058) raises concerns. In the previous round, the MAH was asked to submit a 
draft DHPC and communication plan (in line with recommendations in the GVP Module XV – Safety 
communication including Annex II with templates for the DHPC and Communication plan), as it was 
considered important to communicate directly to concerned health care professionals about these new 
data. In a response of 19 April 2022, the MAH has argued against the need for such communication. 
This was not agreed. On 28 April, the MAH submitted a draft, which has been revised and discussed at 
the PRAC meeting held on 2-5 May 2022. The PRAC supports a DHPC and have made comments to the 
drafts provided (see section 9 PRAC advice and attachments). The MAH has accepted the text after 
proposing some minor amendments which is now agreed by CHMP.

All current SOBs are fulfilled with this procedure and with the ongoing 8th annual reassessment 
procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/S/0057 (also addressing the outstanding SOB on data from the CIBMTR 
registry). None of the fulfilled SOBs have provided any comprehensive data and thus, no change of the 
exceptional circumstances status is foreseen; the proposal of a new SOB is within the scope of the 
annual reassessment procedure. 
The benefit-risk balance of Defitelio, remains unchanged.

4.  Introduction 
Defitelio (defibrotide) is indicated for the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) 
also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
(HSCT) therapy in adults, adolescents, children and infants over 1 month of age. 
VOD/SOS belongs to a group of transplant-related, systemic endothelial diseases and is a potentially 
life-threatening complication of HSCT, triggered by several factors including toxicity of the conditioning 
regimen. The primary insult in VOD/SOS is injury to both sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes 
in zone 3 of the hepatic acinus, triggered by several factors including toxicity of the conditioning 
regimen, release of cytokines due to inflammation and engraftment, release of endotoxins, phenomena 
of alloreactivity, protein C anticoagulant pathway abnormalities, use of calcineurin inhibitors and 
monoclonal antibodies. The disease progresses with deposition of fibrinogen and factor VIII within the 
venular walls and liver sinusoids, venular occlusion and ultimately widespread zonal liver disruption 
and centrilobular haemorrhagic necrosis. In addition, a procoagulant state is often seen with low 
plasma levels of antithrombin, protein C and factor VII and increased levels of PAI-1 and vWF 
multimers (Negrin RS et al 2020). Varying incidence rates ranging from 0 to 62 percent has been 
reported across studies, with a two-to threefold higher incidence in children following HSCT therapy as 
compared to adults. In most cases, VOD/SOS resolves within weeks; however, about 50% develop 
renal insufficiency, and a minority progresses further to severe VOD/SOS and eventually multi-organ 
dysfunction/failure with a mortality rate >80%. In paediatric patients, an estimated 30-60% of 
affected children with VOD/SOS may progress to multi-organ dysfunction/failure. 
VOD/SOS is a clinical diagnosis. There are no laboratory tests or imaging findings that are specific for 
VOD/SOS; serum aminotransferases and bilirubin are often increased, and markers of hepatic function 
often affected, such as prothrombin time. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
(EBMT) has proposed new diagnostic guidelines and prospective severity grading criteria for adults 
(Mohty 2016) and for children (Corbacioglu 2018). Two criteria systems have been used for definition 
of VOD/SOS: the modified Seattle criteria and the Baltimore criteria; however, the sensitivity and 
specificity of these clinical criteria have not been well defined (Negrin RS et al 2020). The adult 
diagnostic criteria from EBMT encompass classical VOD/SOS as defined by Baltimore criteria and also 
include late-onset VOD/SOS (VOD/SOS developing after 21 days post-HSCT). The new paediatric 
diagnostic criteria from EBMT do not require hyperbilirubinemia and do not include a defined timeframe 
of onset. These new diagnostic guidelines are designed to support earlier diagnosis and treatment with 
greater specificity, and to highlight substantial differences in presentation between adult and paediatric 
patients (e g, anicteric presentation in ~30% of children, which is rare in adults presenting by Day 21 
post-HSCT) (Corbacioglu 2018; Mohty, 2016). With these criteria, severe VOD/SOS in adults is 
diagnosed according to the following (at least two criteria are required): time since first clinical 
symptoms of VOD/SOS =/< 4 days, bilirubin (μmol/L) between 85 and 136, bilirubin levels doubling 
within 48 h, transaminases more than 5 and less than 8 x UNL, weight increase between 5 and 10% 
and renal function impaired by more than a factor 1,5 and less than 2 as compared to at transplant. Of 
note, with these criteria, patients are not required to have multi-organ dysfunction/failure to be 
classified as ‘severe’ – if multi-organ failure is present, the patient is classified as very severe 
VOD/SOS. Also for paediatric patients, if MOD/MOF is present, the severity is graded as ‘very severe’. 
For ‘severe’ VOD/SOS in paediatric patients, the following criteria are included: liver function tests > 5 
x ULN, persistent refractory thrombocytopenia > 7 days, bilirubin (μmol/L) >34, ascites with necessity 
for paracentesis, impaired coagulation and impaired renal function with GRF (mL/min) 29-15, need for 
invasive pulmonary ventilation and normal CNS function (Corbacioglu 2018).

In general, mild to moderate VOD/SOS generally has a good outcome with minimal interventions, 
while severe VOD/SOS predicts a poor outcome and warrants more aggressive therapy. For severe 
VOD/SOS, defibrotide is the only approved treatment in addition to supportive care. 
Defitelio (defibrotide) is a mixture of porcine polydeoxyribonucleotides which is considered to affect 
endothelial homeostasis. However, the mechanism of action of defibrotide is not fully understood. 
Defitelio was granted an MA under exceptional circumstances in 2013 after a re-examination procedure 
based on retrospective data and small prospective studies with historical controls, with the specific 
obligation (SOB) of a Post-Approval Safety Study (PASS). To fulfil the SOB, the MAH, in collaboration 
with the EBMT, designed a PASS (DF VOD-2013-03-REG; EMEA/H/C/002393/SOB/PR0001) for a multi-
centre, multinational, prospective, noninterventional registry to record safety and outcome data in 
patients diagnosed with severe VOD following HSCT treated or not with Defitelio. However, this SOB 
could not be fulfilled as it showed not feasible to find patients for the control group. The re-
classification of this study was assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0027. The study 
protocol was amended to a single-arm, multi-centre, multinational, prospective, observational registry. 
Patients enrolled into the study will be followed for adverse events for 12 months and data will be 
collated and provided as a Category 3 PAM.  Two new SOBs were agreed:

Number 
Description 
Former SOB 001 Prior to launch, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall set up a 
patient registry to investigate the long-term safety, health outcomes and 
patterns of utilisation of defibrotide during normal use. It shall be a multi-
centre, multinational and prospective observational disease registry of 
patients diagnosed with severe hepatic VOD following haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enrol patients treated with 
defibrotide, other treatments or supportive care. The MAH shall ensure 
that information regarding all safety concerns identified in the most 
recent version of the Risk Management Plan is being collected. The MAH 
shall also ensure that all health care professionals who might prescribe 
defibrotide are provided with information on the importance of, and how 
to enter patients in, the registry. 
In order to collect comparative safety data, the MAH will provide the final 
CSR and a report of comparative safety data from the Phase 3, 
randomised, adaptive study (15-007) of Defibrotide vs best supportive 
care in the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in adult and 
paediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT). 
The report will also reflect on the safety data being collected during 
prophylactic treatment, and any potential safety differences related to the 
difference in indication (ie treatment vs prophylactic therapy). 
In order to provide comparative data on efficacy, the MAH will submit 
systematic literature reviews and analysis on 
- pooled outcomes of patients with VOD treated with defibrotide 
- VOD incidence and outcomes in patients not treated with defibrotide  
Data analysis from CIBMTR for patients treated and not treated with 
Defibrotide should be provided

New SOB 2 first part was assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0043 and was considered 
formally fulfilled, although no firm conclusions on efficacy could be made. 
The PAM Category III (former SOB 001) was assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0048, 
concluding that Defitelio was used extensively off-label in that study, that clear definitions of 
VOD/severe VOD were missing and that there was no independent review of diagnoses, however,

there were no apparent safety signals identified. No firm conclusions on efficacy or safety could be 
made. 
This type II variation includes the final study report for the current SOB 1, pertaining to comparative 
safety data from the Phase 3, randomised, adaptive study (15-007) of Defibrotide vs. best supportive 
care in the prevention of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in adult and paediatric patients undergoing 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), also reflecting the safety data being collected during 
prophylactic treatment, and any potential safety differences related to the difference in indication (ie 
treatment vs prophylactic therapy). Of note, this pertains to a different indication (prevention) as 
compared to the approved one (treatment). Further, this study includes also efficacy data that are 
included in the report and are summarised below. 
5.  Clinical pharmacology 
5.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The plasma pharmacokinetics of defibrotide was evaluated in Study 15-007 following repeated 
intravenous dosing (2-hour infusion) at a dose of 6.25 mg/kg given four times a day. 
The PK evaluable analysis set included participants who have at least one evaluable PK parameter, i.e. 
6 subjects in the DP arm and 16 subjects in the BSC arm. Different sampling schedules were used 
depending on body weight (≥30 kg or 15-30 kg), whether a subject developed VOD (and received 
defibrotide rescue treatment) or not, and depending on day post-HSCT or day of VOD treatment. 
Plasma concentration versus time data were evaluated based on non-compartmental analysis. 
The majority of the PK results came from Day 14 data in patients who developed VOD and weighing 
≥30 kg. In those subjects, blood samples were drawn at the following time points in relation to start of 
infusion: ca -15 min and at 2, 3, 4 and 5 hrs. 
During the rescue phase on VOD treatment Day 14, the mean Cmax and AUClast were: 
# 44.4 μg/mL and 119 h⋅μg/mL, respectively, in the DP arm (n=4) 
# 39.7 μg/mL and 90.7 h⋅μg/mL, respectively, in the BSC arm (n=14) 
The figures below show the mean defibrotide plasma profiles in the same subjects. The median half-life 
was 0.8 hours in both groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 14/194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          DP (n=4) 
       BSC (N=14) 
In the DP arm of the prophylaxis phase (n=2), the mean Cmax and AUClast were: 
# 30.4 μg/mL and 61.6 h⋅μg/mL, respectively, on Day +1 post-HSCT 
# 40.0 μg/mL and 78.2 h⋅μg/mL, respectively, on Day +7 post-HSCT. 
Sparse defibrotide plasma concentration data (mostly only at end of infusion) were obtained during the 
prophylaxis phase on Day 7, 15 and 30 post-HSCT, and in the rescue phase on VOD treatment Day 30. 
These data are stated to be intended for future population PK analysis. 
Assessor's comment: 
The PK results from Study 15-007 included descriptive plasma exposure parameter estimates for 
defibrotide in a limited number of patients, primarily those with a body weight of ≥30 kg and who 
developed VOD (n=4 in the DP arm and n=14 in the BSC arm). In general, peak concentrations were 
observed at the stop of the intravenous infusion and declined with a half-life of 0.8 hours, which is 
similar to that in healthy volunteers. The interindividual variability in exposure was high, for AUC0-tlast 
60%CV.  
Based on the presented results, no conclusions can be drawn regarding potential differences in the PK 
between age/weight groups. A valid estimate of the clearance was not obtained in the present study. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Study 15-007 
Overview of Study Design 
Study 15-007 was a phase 3, randomized, adaptive study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
defibrotide vs best supportive care (BSC) in the prevention of hepatic VOD in adult and paediatric 
participants undergoing HSCT who were at high risk or very high risk of developing VOD, as diagnosed 
using the modified Seattle criteria.

Figure 1. Study Diagram 
If participants in either the DP or BSC arm developed VOD, per the modified Seattle criteria, they 
should have received rescue defibrotide treatment for VOD as prespecified in the protocol. For 
participants in either arm who developed VOD, defibrotide for rescue treatment of VOD was to be 
administered until resolution of VOD or hospital discharge. 
Participants continued to be monitored for development of late-onset VOD through Day +180 post-
HSCT. 
Assessor's comment: 
Study 15-007 aimed at prevention of VOD, which is not an approved indication for Defitelio. 
However, subjects included who developed VOD would receive defibrotide as rescue treatment, 
which is according to the label albeit for severe VOD only. 
The study treatment phase with defibrotide for prophylaxis of VOD was up to 30 days post-HSCT. 
Monitoring of late-onset VOD continued up to day 180 post-HSCT.  
6.2.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study participants 
This study enrolled adult and paediatric participants (from 1 month and older) scheduled to undergo 
HSCT who were at high risk or very high risk of developing VOD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 16/194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Key inclusion criteria included: 
• Participant must have been scheduled to undergo allogeneic (adults or paediatrics) or autologous 
HSCT (paediatrics only) and have been at high risk or very high risk of developing VOD. 
− “High risk” was defined as participants scheduled to receive myeloablative conditioning (2 alkylating 
agents or at least 1 alkylating agent + total body irradiation) and who had ≥ 1 hepatic risk factor, 
hepatic irradiation, documented evidence of iron overload, or advanced stage neuroblastoma. 
− “Very high risk” was defined as one of the following: participants who had prior treatment with an 
ozogamicin-containing monoclonal antibody, participants with osteopetrosis or primary 
immunodeficiency syndromes who must have received myeloablative conditioning (2 alkylating agents 
or at least 1 alkylating agent + TBI), or patients with Class III, high-risk thalassemia ≥ 7 years old with 
a confirmed diagnosis of hepatomegaly. 
Key exclusion criteria were: 
• Participant had hemodynamic instability within 24 hours before the start of study treatment. 
• Participant had acute bleeding that was clinically significant (as defined in the study protocol) within 
24 hours before the start of study treatment. 
• Participant used any medication that increases the risk of bleeding within 24 hours before the start of 
study treatment. 
See study protocol for detailed definitions of high risk/very high risk and full list of eligibility criteria. 
Assessor's comment: 
The study aimed at assessing the prophylactic effect of adding defibrotide to standard of care (best 
supportive care) to prevent VOD in children (>1 month) and adults who were scheduled to undergo 
HSCT. The study included only subjects in whom the risk of developing VOD was expected to be 
high or very high, based on what is currently known about the disease, mainly based on liver 
disease and the planned conditioning regimens. Haemodynamically unstable patients and patients 
with acute bleeding or recent treatment that increases the risk of bleeding were excluded. Thus, the 
population studied is considered suitable for assessing any prophylactic effect of defibrotide based 
on the assumed (very) high risk of VOD while the risk of bleeding (which is a labelled adverse 
reaction of defibrotide) would be low. 
Treatments 
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive DP 25 mg/kg/day or BSC. All participants 
enrolled in the study (DP and BSC arms) were to receive individualized standard of care therapy based 
on local institutional guidelines and patient need. This standard of care therapy or BSC was intended to 
serve as a study control for comparison with those participants randomized to receive BSC plus DP. 
Defibrotide solution was administered intravenously by study site personnel at a dose of 25 
mg/kg/day, divided into 4 equal doses of 6.25 mg/kg/dose given as 2-hour infusions every 6 hours. 
The reference therapy in this study was BSC according to institutional guidelines and patient need, 
excluding defibrotide. Prohibited medications (ie, medications that increase the risk of bleeding) were 
allowed in the BSC arm, as per institutional guidelines, but not concomitantly with defibrotide while 
taking rescue treatment for VOD. There were no changes in the formulation manufacturing batches. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 17/194 
 
 
 
 
The formulation used in Study 15-007 is the same as the marketed formulation. The same formulation 
of defibrotide was used for adults and paediatric participants. 
For participants randomized to receive defibrotide prophylaxis, 2 to 4 doses of defibrotide should have 
been administered within 24 hours prior to the first dose of conditioning regimen. Defibrotide 
administration was recommended for a minimum duration of 21 days and ending no later than Day 
+30 post-HSCT. Participants randomized to the BSC arm received standard of care therapy according 
to institutional guidelines and patient need. Administration of BSC was to begin on the first day of 
conditioning and continue until Day +30 post-HSCT or hospital discharge, whichever was sooner, or 
diagnosis of VOD, if applicable. For participants who developed VOD per modified Seattle criteria in 
either the DP or BSC arms, defibrotide should have been administered as treatment for VOD until 
resolution of VOD or hospital discharge. 
If a participant on defibrotide developed bleeding, defibrotide should be discontinued. Additionally, 
temporary discontinuation of defibrotide was recommended for participants at significant risk of major 
bleeding who were receiving defibrotide (prophylactically or as rescue medication) and who underwent 
surgery or invasive procedures. 
Assessor's comment: 
Standard of care therapy was based on local institutional guidelines and patient need as judged by 
investigators; thus, there was no formal recommendation on best supportive care. 
The defibrotide dose of 25 mg/kg/day divided into 4 equal doses is the same as the approved 
posology for Defitelio for treatment of severe VOD, which is to be administered for a minimum of 21 
days and continued until the symptoms and signs of severe VOD resolve. Thus, the exposure to 
defibrotide for VOD prophylaxis in this study was similar to the label for treatment of severe VOD. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To compare the efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis in addition to BSC (DP arm) vs BSC alone (BSC arm) 
for the prevention of VOD as measured by VOD-free survival by Day +30 post-HSCT in participants

Secondary objectives: 
The key secondary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis in 
addition to BSC (DP arm) vs BSC alone (BSC arm) for the prevention of VOD as measured by VOD-free 
survival by Day +100 post-HSCT in participants who were at high risk or very high risk for developing 
VOD. 
Other secondary objectives of the study were:

An independent EPAC that was blinded to study treatment assignment was established to determine 
whether a participant met the criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint (ie, VOD-free survival by Day 
+30 post-HSCT) and the key secondary efficacy endpoint (ie, VOD-free survival at Day +100 post-
HSCT) using the modified Seattle criteria for diagnosis of VOD.

Assessor's comment: 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis in addition to BSC vs 
BSC alone for the prevention of VOD, with the primary endpoint VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 
post-HSCT. An independent endpoint adjudication committee that was blinded to study treatment 
assignment determined whether criteria for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were 
met, using modified Seattle criteria for diagnosis of VOD. 
Safety outcomes were secondary; such endpoints included safety of defibrotide in addition to BSC vs 
BSC alone (including AE profile, SAE profile, laboratory abnormalities, and vital signs); health-
related QoL; incidence of grades 2, 3 and 4 acute GvHD and incidence of chronic GvHD by Day 180 
+HSCT; graft failure and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment. 
Mortality was included in the primary efficacy endpoint (VOD-free survival rate by Day +30) and the 
secondary endpoints VOD-free survival by Day +100 and +180 post-HSCT, and NRM (non-relapse 
mortality) by day 100 and 180 post-HSCT. There is also a post-hoc analysis on overall mortality, see 
Safety below. 
Sample size 
On the basis of literature and results from a previously conducted prevention study (Study 2004-
000592-33) with defibrotide (Corbacioglu et al 2012), the proposed sample size was 200 patients per 
treatment group for a total sample size of 400 patients. Through simulations, this sample size provides 
a 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46 for VOD-free survival by Day +30 post-HSCT in DF 
group as compared with BSC group, with an average of 68 events total. The HR of 0.46 is based on 
86% and 72% VOD-free survival rates by Day +30 post-HSCT for DF group and BSC group 
respectively, which translate to 14% and 28% as the incidence of VOD or death by Day+30 post-HSCT 
for the 2 groups respectively. The assumptions for the simulations to calculate the sample size also 
include: (1) a two-look group sequential design at one-sided significance level of 0.025 (overall) with 
one interim analysis for efficacy stopping (one-sided significance level of 0.0005) or non-binding futility 
stopping at <=10% conditional power; and (2) 10% dropout rate. Due to uncertainties associated with 
the study design assumptions, specifically the background rate of events in the BSC treatment group 
and the size of the treatment effect, an interim analysis to be overseen by the DMC was planned when 
70% of patients are evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., VOD-free survival by Day +30 
post-HSCT), with specific rules for efficacy stop (i.e., 1-sided alpha of 0.0005), futility stop (i.e., 
conditional power <10%), and possible sample size re-estimation up to a maximum of 600 patients 
total when the conditional power is in the promising zone. 
The pre-planned interim analysis was conducted after 280 participants (70% of planned sample size) 
had been evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint. Based on the results of the interim analysis, the 
DMC recommended that study enrolment be stopped based on futility. The DMC concluded that it was 
highly unlikely to reach statistical significance in the final analysis of the primary endpoint of VOD-free 
survival at Day +30 post-HSCT if the study were to complete enrolment. Screening was stopped on 29 
April 2020. A total of 372 participants are included in the final study results presented. 
Assessor's comment: 
The study was stopped based on futility after evaluation of the pre-planned interim analysis 
including data from 280 subjects. Nevertheless, a total of 372 participants are included in the final 
study results presented, which is in line with the proposed sample size.

Randomisation 
All participants were assigned to randomized study intervention using an IWRS. The investigator or 
designee accessed IWRS to obtain treatment assignments for participants eligible for the study. The 
sponsor remained blinded to the master randomization code until after database lock. Randomization 
was stratified according to risk of developing VOD (high risk or very high risk), age (> 16 years or ≤ 16 
years), and country. If a participant met both the high-risk and the very high-risk criteria, the 
participant was classified as very high risk. 
Assessor's comment: 
Randomisation was stratified according to age, country and risk of developing VOD (high-risk or 
very high-risk) with enrolment of participants meeting high-risk criteria capped at 65% of the total 
enrolment. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
To minimize potential for bias, the following blinding measures were employed: 
• The central reviewer of imaging studies was blinded to study treatment assignment and all non-
radiologic participant data. 
• Members of the EPAC were blinded to study treatment assignment, were not employees of the 
sponsor, and were not otherwise involved in the study. 
• The sponsor did not have access to the assessment of VOD by the EPAC for analysis of the primary 
endpoint. In addition, the sponsor was blinded to the DMC reports/outputs produced independently for 
the closed sessions of the DMC meetings throughout the study until the database lock and unblinding. 
Assessor's comment: 
The study was open-label, but assessment of the primary efficacy outcome events was done by a 
blinded endpoint-adjudication committee. This is of some interest given the large discrepancy 
between investigators assessment and EPAC assessment of VOD (see Outcomes below). 
Statistical methods 
The analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints of VOD-free survival by Day +30 and Day 
+100, respectively, were based on EPAC adjudication of VOD. Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the 
robustness of the primary analysis were also based on EPAC adjudication. A descriptive analysis was 
performed on the investigator assessment of VOD to assess consistency between investigator and 
EPAC results. 
To control the study-wise type I error, a sequential testing strategy began with the test of the primary 
efficacy endpoint. The test on the key secondary efficacy endpoint was only to be conducted if the 
primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant. This gate-keeping approach kept the family-wise 
error rate at 1-sided 0.025 for the comparisons of the 2 treatment arms in the primary and the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint analyses. Other secondary efficacy endpoints were descriptive and tested 
without multiplicity adjustments; p-values are nominal.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis was to be performed using the ITT population. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was the VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 post-HSCT, as adjudicated by the independent 
EPAC. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 post-HSCT were to be 
presented for the 2 treatment groups and a stratified log rank test was to be performed as the primary 
efficacy endpoint analysis to establish the treatment difference. In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test would be used to compare a composite binary endpoint of VOD free 
+ alive at Day +30 post-HSCT between the 2 treatment groups, where the composite binary endpoint 
is defined by the proportion of patients who are VOD free and alive at Day +30 post-HSCT. 
Additional sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint included but were not limited to: the 
unstratified log rank test for the ITT population and the stratified log rank test using the mITT 
population.  Both the stratified log rank test and the CMH test were to be performed by the 2 
stratification variables for randomization - very high risk/high risk and paediatric (≤ 16 yrs)/adults 
(>16 yrs). 
The timing variable for the primary efficacy endpoint was anchored at time of HSCT (time=0). It was 
anticipated that fewer than 2% of patients would not undergo HSCT in the ITT population. For those 
patients, time 0 is counted at randomization. The timing variable was defined as the number of days 
from time 0 to the earlier of VOD or death by Day +30. If a patient was not followed for 30 days, the 
censoring for that endpoint would be defined at the time of last available evaluation of VOD by EPAC. If 
a patient in BSC group was rescued but VOD is not confirmed by EPAC then the patient will be 
censored at the time of rescue initiation. Additional analysis based on other timing and censoring 
strategies would be considered and detailed in the SAP. 
Patients assessed for the primary efficacy endpoint before the interim analysis make up the stage 1 
sample, and those patients assessed after the interim analysis make up the stage 2 sample. At interim 
analysis, the stage 1 sample was used to construct the treatment difference of the primary efficacy 
endpoint and the stratified log rank test of efficacy. For the final analysis, the method of Cui, Hung, 
and Wang (Cui et al 1999) was to be used to combine the independent stratified log rank test statistics 
from stage 1 and stage 2. To maintain an overall significance level at 1-sided alpha=0.025, the 
incremental alpha is specified at 1-sided 0.0005 for interim analysis and 1-sided 0.0245 for final 
analysis (the corresponding nominal 1-sided alpha is 0.0005 for interim analysis and 1-sided 0.02498 
for final analysis). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is VOD-free survival by Day +100 post-HSCT and was to be 
analysed similarly to the primary efficacy endpoint. The remaining secondary efficacy endpoints were 
to be tested without multiplicity adjustments, and nominal p-values would be reported. 
The incidence of NRM by Day +100 and Day +100 post-HSCT was compared between the treatment 
arms. Non-relapse mortality was defined as death that occurs after HSCT in participants who were 
noted as having malignant primary disease on the disease history eCRF and who did not have primary 
disease relapse post-HSCT. Only participants with malignant primary disease at baseline were included 
in the analysis.

For Resolution of VOD and Time to Resolution of VOD, of those patients who were diagnosed with VOD 
by Day +30 post-HSCT by the investigator, the proportion of patients who have resolution of VOD by 
Day +180 post-HSCT would be summarized by treatment group. The time to resolution of VOD was 
defined as the date of VOD diagnosis to the date that the last criterion for resolution of VOD was met. 
Time to resolution of VOD was to be summarized and compared between the 2 treatment groups using 
a log-rank test. 
An interim analysis overseen by the DMC was planned for when 70% of participants were evaluated for 
the primary efficacy endpoint (ie, VOD-free survival by Day +30 post-HSCT), with specific rules for 
efficacy stop (ie, 1-sided alpha of 0.0005), futility stop (ie, conditional power < 10%), and possible 
sample size re-estimation up to a maximum of 600 participants total. Details of the interim analysis 
and adaptive design decision rules are provided in the interim SAP. 
Changes in Planned Analyses Prior to Unblinding or Database Lock 
All changes in the original planned analyses for the study were implemented by a SAP amendment 
before unblinding and database lock (SAP Section 8.8.6). The SAP amendment includes details 
regarding COVID-19-related changes. The definition of the Safety Analysis Set was updated for the 
BSC arm to include all participants randomized who received at least 1 dose of study drug (defibrotide 
or conditioning regimen) to ensure that safety data would be summarized consistently in the 2 
treatment arms. 
Changes Following Study Unblinding/Database Lock and Post-hoc Analyses 
Participants within the study may have died outside of the protocol-defined AE reporting period (see 
Section 6.8.1.5, Adverse Event Recording and Reporting, of the study protocol [Section 8.1.6]). Death 
data and cause of death throughout the entire study were captured on the Death eCRF. After database 
lock, a summary of all deaths by Day +30, Day +100, and Day +180 post-HSCT by treatment arm 
(Table 19) and a listing of all deaths by participant (Listing 16.2.21) were produced. These data are 
described below.

6.3.  Results 
Participant flow 
Assessor's comment: 
There were 372 randomised subjects: 190 allocated to defibrotide in addition to best supportive care 
(BSC), 182 allocated to (BSC) only. During the prophylaxis phase, 30/190 (15.7%) discontinued 
defibrotide, the majority due to adverse events. There were 56 subjects who developed VOD and 
received defibrotide as rescue treatment (however, based on outcome data, there appears to have 
been 29 additional subjects who developed VOD – see Outcomes below). Of those who received 
defibrotide as rescue treatment, 26/56 discontinued treatment, the majority due to adverse events 
or death.  
Recruitment 
The study was initiated 11 January 2017. Last participant last visit was 20 October 2020. The study 
enrolled participants at 104 centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, 
Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DMC recommended that study enrolment be stopped 
based on futility. The DMC concluded that it was unlikely to reach statistical significance in the final 
analysis of the primary endpoint of VOD-free survival at Day +30 post-HSCT if the study were to

complete enrolment. The DMC indicated no safety concerns for enrolled participants related to stopping 
enrolment. Screening was stopped on 29 April 2020. Participants in screening at this time discontinued 
all screening activities. Participants randomized to the DP or BSC arms could continue all study 
activities and follow-up evaluations until study completion or early termination. Because defibrotide is 
approved for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with VOD, participants who were receiving 
VOD rescue treatment at the time enrolment was stopped could continue treatment per protocol and 
could continue all study activities and follow-up evaluations until study completion or early 
termination. Participants who developed VOD were offered defibrotide as rescue treatment per protocol 
and could continue all study activities and follow-up evaluations until study completion or early 
termination. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol is dated 09 May 2016. There were three amendments; Amendment 01 v2.0:19 
January 2017; Amendment 02 v3.0 24 February 2017; Amendment 03 v4.0 20 August 2018. 
Some more significant changes that are included in Amendment 1 and 2 were eligibility criteria (to 
clarify that patients must meet to be at “high risk” or “very high risk” for developing VOD); weight 
criteria for PK assessments; clarifications on best supportive care, the different time periods of the 
study and the timing of the various assessment; that defibrotide was to be discontinued for patients 
who develop bleeding and that defibrotide be temporarily discontinued in patients who undergo 
surgery or invasive procedures at significant risk of major bleeding; dosing clarification; clarification on 
permitted and prohibited medications; definitions of the primary efficacy assessment regarding ascites; 
clarifications on adjudication/definitions for secondary efficacy assessments. 
Some more significant changes that are included in Amendment 3 were updated/revised inclusion 
criteria in order to clarify operational definitions of iron overload, myeloablative conditioning, and 
hepatomegaly, and clarification on definition of myeloablative conditioning for very high risk patients; 
clarifications on defibrotide dosing and when agents that increase the risk of bleeding are allowed or 
prohibited; revised timing of blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic assessments according to 
intensive schedule, sparse schedule, and contingent schedule for clarity; updated collection of 
concomitant medication in order to specify that all medications and therapies taken between baseline 
and Day +60 post-HSCT will be recorded as concomitant medications; clarification that overdose, 
medication errors, and drug misuse of the study drug should be reported. 
Assessor's comment: 
The more substantial Amendments 1 and 2 were included early in the study and are not considered 
to affect the overall study results. Amendment 3 was included relatively late in the study but is not 
found to affect the overall study results. 
Baseline data 
Median (min, max) age at screening overall was 14.0 (0, 72) years. The most common primary 
diseases in the overall study population (n=372) were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (100 participants 
[26.9%]), acute myelogenous leukaemia (96 participants [25.8%]), and neuroblastoma (57 
participants [15.3%]). The majority of participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy 
alone (101 participants [27.2%]) or chemotherapy and another treatment modality for their primary 
disease.

Table 3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics - Paediatric Subgroup, ITT Analysis Set 
Assessor's comment: 
For the entire study population, demographics and baseline characteristics were similar in the two 
treatment arms. The most frequent underlying disease was acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (100 
participants [26.9%]), acute myelogenous leukaemia (96 participants [25.8%]), and neuroblastoma 
(57 participants [15.3%]). Transplant data for the 353/372 subjects who underwent HSCT have 
been provided; the majority of these had allogenic grafts. Myeloablative conditioning was given to 
approximately two thirds of subjects. 
There were 198 paediatric subjects in the study, thus constituting more than half of the study 
population, with a median age of 4.5 yrs (range 0-16 yrs) at screening; 104 in the defibrotide group 
and 94 in the SoC group. Neuroblastoma was the most common primary disease followed by ALL 
and AML in the paediatric group. For 59/198 children, the primary disease was recurrent at baseline.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 372 participants randomized in the study, 241 participants (64.8%) completed the study. The 
most common reasons for withdrawing from the study were death (50 participants [13.4%] total) and 
AE (26 participants [7.0%] total).

Table 4. Participant Disposition – ITT Analysis Set 
Of the 190 participants randomized to the DP arm, 181 participants (95.3%) received at least 1 dose 
of defibrotide during the prophylaxis phase. The prophylaxis phase of the study is defined as follows: • 
If VOD occurs, the prophylaxis phase starts on the Baseline date and ends on the day before the start 
date of rescue defibrotide (ie, rescue treatment start date – 1). • If VOD does not occur, the 
prophylaxis phase starts on the Baseline date and ends on the date of study completion/early 
termination. 
A total of 56 participants (15.1%), 25 participants (13.2%) in the DP arm and 31 participants (17.0%) 
in the BSC arm, experienced VOD (as diagnosed by the investigator) and received defibrotide as 
rescue therapy. The rescue phase is defined as follows: • For the subset of participants who developed 
VOD and received rescue defibrotide, the rescue treatment phase begins on the start date of rescue 
defibrotide and ends on the date of study completion/early termination. 
Protocol Deviations 
A total of 123 participants (33.1%) had a major protocol deviation, with a similar proportion of 
participants in each treatment arm:

Table 5. Major Protocol Deviations – ITT Analysis Set 
Assessor's comment: 
One third of the ITT population had major protocol deviations, primarily related to study 
procedures/assessments (not further specified) and informed consent form processing/timing. The 
MAH should provide the most frequent reasons for deviation in study procedures/assessments and 
discuss the integrity of the study given the large number of major protocol deviations (LoQ). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The results of the primary efficacy endpoint, VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 post-HSCT as 
adjudicated by the independent EPAC, are shown in Table 6. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: VOD-free 
Survival by Day +30 post-HSCT – ITT Analysis Set The VOD-free survival rates at Day +30 post-HSCT 
in the DP arm vs the BSC arm with KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs) of 66.8% (57.8%, 
74.4%) and 72.5% (62.3%, 80.4%), respectively. The p-value from the stratified log rank test that 
compares VOD-free survival over time between the 2 treatment arms is 0.8504, indicating no 
difference. The HR of the DP arm with respect to the BSC arm is 1.273, with a 95% CI of 0.839 to 
1.932.

Concordance between EPAC- and Investigator-assessed VOD-free Survival 
Concordance between EPAC- and investigator-assessed VOD by Day +30 post-HSCT was analysed for 
each of the 2 treatment arms and overall. A total of 35 participants (9.9%) were assessed to have 
VOD by Day +30 post-HSCT by both the EPAC and investigator, and a total of 221 participants 
(62.6%) were assessed to not have VOD by Day +30 post-HSCT by both the EPAC and investigator. 
Overall, EPAC and investigator assessments were concordant in 256 (72.5%) cases. Out of the 35 
cases where the EPAC and the investigator both diagnosed VOD, the VOD diagnosis dates were 
concordant in 12 (34.3%) cases. In a total of 50 participants (14.2%), the EPAC assessed the 
participant as having VOD while the investigator assessed the participant as not having VOD. 
Concordance was similar between the 2 treatment arms. Of note, the EPAC could assess VOD as ‘Not 
evaluable’, whereas the investigator could not (ie, ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ were the only options). The EPAC 
assessed 13 participants (3.7%) overall as not evaluable. The investigator-assessed VOD-free survival 
rates at Day +30 post-HSCT were similar between the DP and BSC treatment arms, with KM estimates 
(95% CIs) of 85.0% (78.6%, 89.7%) and 80.4% (73.4%, 85.8%), respectively.

analysis Set (from CSR Table 14.2.1.11) 
Assessor’s comment: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was not met; there was no preventive effect of defibrotide on VOD-free 
survival day 30+ post-HSCT in the defibrotide group as compared to best supportive care. There was a 
numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care; this was particularly pronounced in the 
paediatric population. In the overall ITT population, VOD/death occurred in 50/190 subjects in the 
defibrotide arm (26.3%) and 40/182 subjects in the BSC arm (22%). The KM VOD-free survival 
estimates (95% CIs) at Day +30 post-HSCT in the defibrotide arm vs the BSC arm were 66.8% 
(57.8%, 74.4%) and 72.5% (62.3%, 80.4%), respectively. In the paediatric population, VOD/death 
occurred in 32/104 subjects in the defibrotide arm (30.8%) and 20/94 subjects in the BSC arm 
(21.3%). The KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs) at Day +30 post-HSCT in the paediatric 
defibrotide arm vs the BSC arm were (95% CIs) 62.5% (50.2%, 72.5%) and 75.0% (63.7%, 83.2%), 
respectively. 
There is no clear presentation of the number of VOD and the number of deaths that contributed to the 
primary efficacy endpoint events. It is stated below that there were in total 20 participants (10 in each 
treatment arm) who died during the prophylaxis phase of the study (see Safety below); in a different 
analysis there were a total of 15 deaths up to day +30 post-HSCT (10 in the defibrotide arm and 5 in 
the BSC arm, all but one in the defibrotide group with an adverse event as the primary cause of death, 
see also Safety). There were 85 adjudicated VOD events, and thus at least 15 deaths up to Day +30 
post-HSCT. Subjects who were diagnosed with VOD were to be treated with defibrotide as rescue 
therapy and would then be censored from the prophylaxis analyses. Given that there were in total 90 
primary efficacy outcome events, the figures appear not to match. The MAH should clarify the number 
of events of VOD and deaths respectively that contributed to the primary efficacy endpoint, and 
whether the presented data on primary efficacy outcome events includes any subjects with more than 
one event (LoQ). 
The terminology used by the MAH is slightly inconsistent in the sense that data is labelled as 
“censored” in the context of VOD-free survival analysis and as “missing” in other contexts. While the 
terms are similar, the difference is that “missing” data is completely unknown and “censored” data 
partially unknown, i e for subjects censored at 30 days follow-up, it is known that the event did not 
happen before 30 days FU, which is more information compared to have no information at all (ie no 
event). This difference is relevant here because the results (primary efficacy endpoint – ITT analysis 
set, Table 6 above) show statistical test results from a log rank test comparing VOD-free survival times 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 40/194 
 
 
 
 
 
across the total follow-up time and the VOD-free survival rate by +30 post-HSCT as landmark time. 
While the log rank test uses all VOD-free survival times across the follow-up time, the VOD-free 
survival rate at landmark time by +30 post-HSCT uses a single timepoint for comparison. Therefore, 
the VOD-free survival rate at landmark time is not a completely consistent representation of the 
descriptive treatment effect on VOD-free survival times tested by the log rank test because the 
“estimand” is somewhat different between the survival rate analysis (ie difference in distribution of 
events) vs survival time analysis (ie difference in distribution of survival times). While it would be 
appropriate for a survival rate analysis to label patients with “has event” vs “has no event” vs 
“missing”, for a survival time analysis the patients should be labelled as “has event” vs “censored” 
would be appropriate. Censored data can be caused by end of follow-up without previous event or 
other intercurrent events which make the data not observable (eg study discontinuation). Given the 
large proportion of ‘other reason’ for censoring in the presentation of primary efficacy outcome events, 
the MAH is asked to present these other reasons in more detail, including any imbalance between 
treatment groups (LoQ). 
For the paediatric population (aged 16 and below), the difference between the VOD-free survival rate 
at landmark time +30 post-HSCT (69.2% in DP, 78.7 % in BSC, RR=1.45) and from the KM curve 
(62.5% in DP vs. 75%, RR=1.5) are similar but not identical, because the KM curve uses an estimation 
method adjusting for the patients no longer at risk of having an event at +30 post-HSCT, ie an 
adjustment for censored data. Overall, the effect sizes for Relative Risk (RR) from VOD-free survival 
rate =1.45, from KM with RR = 1.5 and from the Hazard Ratio from Cox PH =1.55 are reasonably 
consistent (attributing differences to differences in methods). 
The primary analysis and sensitivity analyses (except worst case analysis) show numerically increased, 
statistically non-significant risks for the DP group of around HR= 1.27. The worst-case (implausible) 
scenario gives a nominally statistically hazard ratio of HR =1.977 [CI95% 1.349, 2.897]. For the 
worst-case scenario, the MAH has used a “worst-case” imputation, which is also described in the 
“Statistical Analysis Plan” document (4.2.10, primary, 4.5.3.1 sensitivity analysis), where all censored 
patients imputed as having an event in the DP arm, but as no event (censored) in the BSC (control) 
arm. This assumption is not plausible, but a conservative assumption to estimate a lower boundary of 
the effect size. 
There was a clear discordance between the endpoint adjudication committee (EPAC) assessment and 
investigators’ assessment of VOD. The majority of cases adjudicated as VOD were not assessed as 
VOD by investigators. It is understood from the tables above that there were in total 85 adjudicated 
cases of VOD in the mITT population (all subjects in the ITT population who underwent HSCT), 47/179 
in the defibrotide group and 38/174 in the BSC group. Of those, 50/85 were not assessed as VOD by 
investigators but were adjudicated by the EPAC; 4 cases were assessed as VOD by investigators but 
not by the EPAC. There was an imbalance between treatment arms in assessment of VOD, with more 
cases assessed as VOD by the EPAC only in the defibrotide group as compared to the BSC group. In 
addition to the overall discordance between the blinded EPAC and the non-blinded investigators, in the 
35 cases assessed as VOD by both investigators and EPAC, the date of VOD diagnosis did not match in 
two thirds of the cases. These data are interpreted in that there was a low recognition of VOD among 
investigators, especially in the open-label defibrotide treatment group. This is of particular interest 
given that this study had a blinded EPAC assessing all patients in the study, which has not been the 
case in previous defibrotide trials. 
As stated in the description of participant flow above, there were 56 subjects who developed VOD 
during the prophylaxis phase and received defibrotide as rescue treatment. The decision to start 
rescue treatment was based on the investigator’s assessment of VOD. However, it appears that there 
were in total 40 cases of VOD recognised by investigators. The MAH is asked to explain this 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 41/194 
 
 
 
discrepancy and to discuss the vast difference between investigators and EPAC assessments of VOD 
and date of VOD diagnosis in more detail, including the diagnostic criteria used and their clinical 
relevance (LoQ). 
The exact type of best supportive care used has not been presented. Since there was no prespecified 
BSC, it is unclear if there is any imbalance between treatment arms. Although there is no approved 
product for prophylaxis of VOD, a Cochrane review on prophylaxis of VOD from 2015 concluded that 
there was low or very low quality evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of 
hepatic VOD, all-cause mortality and mortality due to VOD in HSCT recipients. However, the optimal 
regimen is not well-defined. The Cochrane review also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to 
support the use of heparin, LMWH, defibrotide, glutamine, FFP, antithrombin III, and PGE1, and that 
further high-quality RCTs are needed. From the presentation of concomitant therapy (see Safety 
below), the majority of study subjects were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (310/372 or 83.3%) 
with a similar proportion in each treatment group; the assessment of concomitant therapy is however 
hampered by the non-consistent capture of concomitant therapy during the study (see below). 
Overall, these data show that defibrotide had no effect as compared to best supportive care for 
prophylaxis of VOD. This lack of efficacy does not translate into questioning efficacy for the approved 
treatment indication (the data on outcome of defibrotide treatment as rescue treatment for those who 
developed VOD are however of interest for the approved indication, see secondary endpoints below). 
However, there was a numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care; this was particularly 
pronounced in the paediatric population, which is considered worrisome from a safety perspective. This 
trend of worse outcome in the defibrotide group is found of importance also for the approved 
indication, given the similarities in the populations studied. Also, these data should be seen in light of 
previous data on prophylaxis submitted within the MAA in 2013, in which the death rate was higher in 
the prevention study when children who did not develop VOD and received DF were compared with 
subjects in the control arm who did not develop VOD. The MAH is asked to discuss these findings in 
relation to the totality of data for the approved indications for Defitelio (LoQ). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Because the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, hypothesis testing was not performed for the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint and that analysis is descriptive only. The analyses of other secondary 
efficacy endpoints were descriptive; nominal p-values are reported. 
The VOD-free survival rates at Day +100 post-HSCT as adjudicated by the independent EPAC (key 
secondary endpoint) were, with KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs), 49.8% (26.1%, 69.5%) in 
the defibrotide arm and 57.1% (36.6%, 73.1%) in the BSC arm. The HR of the DP arm with respect to 
the BSC arm is 1.208, with a 95% CI of 0.835 to 1.748. 
A total of 47 participants (24.7%) in the DP arm and 38 participants (20.9%) in the BSC arm 
experienced EPAC-assessed VOD by Day +30 post-HSCT. The proportion of participants who 
experienced VOD after Day +30 post-HSCT and on or before Day +100 post-HSCT was similar in the 2 
treatment arms (6 participants [3.2%] in the DP arm, and 5 participants [2.7%] in the BSC arm). The 
proportion of participants who experienced VOD after Day +30 post-HSCT and on or before Day +180 
post-HSCT, was also similar in the 2 treatment arms (6 participants [3.2%] in the DP arm, and 5 
participants [2.7%] in the BSC arm). The diagnosis of VOD through Day +100 post-HSCT was made by 
the EPAC, and the diagnosis of VOD after Day +100 post-HSCT was based on investigator 
assessments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 42/194 
 
 
 
The VOD-free survival rates at Day +180 post-HSCT were similar between the DP and BSC treatment 
arms, with KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs) of 34.6% (18.2%, 51.8%) and 42.8% (26.7%, 
58.0%), respectively. 
Of the participants with malignant primary disease history, 22 of 147 participants (15.0%) in the DP 
arm and 11 of 139 participants (7.9%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM (Non-relapse mortality) by 
Day +100 post-HSCT; 25 of 147 participants (17.0%) in the DP arm and 16 of 139 participants 
(11.5%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +180 post-HSCT. The HR (95% CI) of the DP arm 
with respect to the BSC arm is 2.243 (1.082, 4.647) at Day +100 post-HSCT and 1.885 (0.989, 3.592) 
at Day +180 post-HSCT. 
At Day +30 post-HSCT, 8 participants (4.2%) in the DP arm and 8 participants (4.4%) in the BSC arm 
had VOD-associated MOD. At both Day +100 post-HSCT and Day +180 post-HSCT, 9 participants 
(4.7%) in the DP arm and 10 participants (5.5%) in the BSC arm had VOD-associated MOD. 
Of the participants diagnosed by the investigator with VOD by Day +30 post-HSCT, 6 of 23 participants 
(26.1%) in the DP arm and 15 of 29 participants (51.7%) in the BSC arm experienced VOD resolution 
by Day +180 post-HSCT. The HR of the DP arm with respect to the BSC arm is 0.316, with a 95% CI 
of 0.112 to 0.893.

Assessor's comment: 
Since the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, the data on secondary efficacy endpoints are 
descriptive only. There are some worrying results regarding the key secondary efficacy endpoint 
with a numerical difference between treatment arms (VOD-free survival at Day +100 post HSCT of 
49.8% in the defibrotide arm as compared to 57.1% in the best supportive care arm); even though 
the 95% CIs overlap and this is descriptive data only, there is thus a similar trend of worse outcome 
in the defibrotide group as for the primary efficacy outcome. 
What is further worrisome is the non-relapse mortality; again, since these are descriptive data, 
some caution is warranted. However, 22 of 147 participants (15.0%) in the DP arm and 11 of 139 
participants (7.9%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +100 post-HSCT. Of the participants 
with malignant primary disease history, 25 of 147 participants (17.0%) in the DP arm and 16 of 139 
participants (11.5%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +180 post-HSCT. 
The data on participants diagnosed with VOD by Day 30 post-HSCT show resolution of VOD by day 
180 post-HSCT in 6/23 or 26.1% of subjects in the defibrotide arm and 15/29 or 51.7% of subjects 
in the best supportive care arm. The severity of the diagnosed VOD is not clear, thus it should be 
clarified if defibrotide was given in accordance with the Defitelio label (indicated in severe VOD only) 
or not (LoQ); however, the difference between treatment arms are considered to clearly disfavour 
those who had been treated with defibrotide for prophylaxis. The resolution rates appear to be in 
line with, or slightly lower than, what is described in literature for spontaneous resolution of VOD. It 
is assumed that all subjects who developed VOD as judged by investigator were treated with 
defibrotide regardless of treatment allocation for the prophylaxis phase; the MAH is asked to verify 
this assumption. Also, since a large proportion of cases of VOD were defined by the EPAC (and 
assumed not to have been treated for VOD by investigators) the MAH should present the outcome in 
terms of resolution of VOD in those treated with defibrotide for rescue as compared to those who 
developed VOD but were not treated with defibrotide, both for the entire study population and 
divided by age group (paediatric subjects vs adults) (LoQ). 
For the additional secondary endpoints of health-related QoL; incidence of grades 2, 3 and 4 acute 
GvHD and incidence of chronic GvHD by Day 180 +HSCT; graft failure and time to neutrophil and 
platelet engraftment, these and the exploratory endpoints are discussed in the Safety section below. 
Overall, in line with the primary efficacy endpoint, descriptive data on the secondary efficacy 
endpoints indicate at best no effect of defibrotide but a possible unfavourable effect on VOD-free 
survival, non-relapse mortality and resolution of VOD. 
6.4.  Discussion 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 15-007 was a randomised open-label study aimed at assessing the prophylactic effect of adding 
defibrotide to standard of care (best supportive care) to prevent VOD in children (>1 month) and 
adults who were scheduled to undergo HSCT. The study included only subjects in whom the risk of 
developing VOD was expected to be high or very high, based on what is currently known about the 
disease, mainly based on the planned conditioning regimens. Haemodynamically unstable patients and 
patients with acute bleeding or recent treatment that increases the risk of bleeding were excluded. 
Thus, the population studied is considered suitable for assessing any prophylactic effect of defibrotide 
based on the assumed (very) high risk of VOD while the risk of bleeding (which is a labelled adverse 
reaction of defibrotide) would be low. The study aimed at prevention of VOD, which is not an approved 
Assessment report

indication for Defitelio. However, subjects included who developed VOD would receive defibrotide as 
rescue treatment, which is according to the label albeit for severe VOD only. 
The study was stopped based on futility after evaluation of the pre-planned interim analysis including 
data from 280 subjects. In total, there were 372 randomised subjects: 190 allocated to defibrotide in 
addition to best supportive care (BSC), 182 allocated to (BSC) only. 
The defibrotide dose used in the defibrotide arm (on top of best supportive care) of 25 mg/kg/day 
divided into 4 equal doses is the same as the approved posology for Defitelio for treatment of severe 
VOD, which is to be administered for a minimum of 21 days and continued until the symptoms and 
signs of severe VOD resolve. Thus, the exposure to defibrotide for VOD prophylaxis in this study was 
similar to the label for treatment of severe VOD, and the approved posology was also used for rescue 
treatment of VOD. Standard of care therapy was based on local institutional guidelines and patient 
need as judged by investigators; there was no formal recommendation on best supportive care. 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis in addition to BSC vs BSC 
alone for the prevention of VOD, with the primary endpoint VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 post-
HSCT. An independent endpoint adjudication committee that was blinded to study treatment 
assignment determined whether criteria for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were 
met, using modified Seattle criteria for diagnosis of VOD. This is considered a strength of the study; a 
similar blinded independent EPAC was not used in previous defibrotide studies. This is further of 
interest given the large discrepancy between VOD as adjudicated by investigators vs by the EPAC (see 
Efficacy data below). 
Mortality was included in the primary efficacy endpoint (VOD-free survival rate by Day +30) and the 
secondary endpoints VOD-free survival by Day +100 and +180 post-HSCT, and NRM (non-relapse 
mortality) by day 100 and 180 post-HSCT. There is also a post-hoc analysis on overall mortality, see 
Safety below. 
For the entire study population, demographics and baseline characteristics were similar in the two 
treatment arms. The most frequent underlying disease was acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (100 
participants [26.9%]), acute myelogenous leukaemia (96 participants [25.8%]), and neuroblastoma 
(57 participants [15.3%]). Transplant data for the 353/372 subjects who underwent HSCT have been 
provided; the majority of these had allogenic grafts. Myeloablative conditioning was given to 
approximately two thirds of subjects. 
There were 198 paediatric subjects in the study, thus constituting more than half of the study 
population, with a median age of 4.5 yrs (range 0-16 yrs) at screening; 104 in the defibrotide group 
and 94 in the SoC group. Neuroblastoma was the most common primary disease followed by ALL and 
AML in the paediatric group. For 59/198 children, the primary disease was recurrent at baseline. 
One third of the ITT population had major protocol deviations, primarily related to study 
procedures/assessments (not further specified) and informed consent form processing/timing. The 
MAH should provide the most frequent reasons for deviation in study procedures/assessments and 
discuss the overall integrity of the study given the large number of major protocol deviations (LoQ). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was not met; there was no preventive effect of defibrotide on VOD-free 
survival day 30+ post-HSCT in the defibrotide group as compared to best supportive care. There was a 
numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care; this was particularly pronounced in the 
paediatric population. In the overall ITT population, VOD/death occurred in 50/190 subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 45/194 
 
 
 
defibrotide arm (26.3%) and 40/182 subjects in the BSC arm (22%). The VOD-free survival rates at 
Day +30 post-HSCT in the defibrotide arm vs the BSC arm with KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% 
CIs) of 66.8% (57.8%, 74.4%) and 72.5% (62.3%, 80.4%), respectively. In the paediatric population, 
VOD/death occurred in 32/104 subjects in the defibrotide arm (30.8%) and 20/94 subjects in the BSC 
arm (21.3%). The VOD-free survival rates at Day +30 post-HSCT in the paediatric defibrotide arm vs 
the BSC arm with KM VOD-free survival estimates (95% CIs) of 62.5% (50.2%, 72.5%) and 75.0% 
(63.7%, 83.2%), respectively. 
There is no clear presentation of the number of VOD and the number of deaths that contributed to the 
primary efficacy endpoint events. It is stated below that there were in total 20 participants (10 in each 
treatment arm) who died during the prophylaxis phase of the study (see Safety below); in a different 
analysis there were a total of 15 deaths up to day +30 post-HSCT (10 in the defibrotide arm and 5 in 
the BSC arm, all but one in the defibrotide group with an adverse event as the primary cause of death, 
see also Safety). There were 85 adjudicated VOD events, and thus at least 15 deaths up to Day +30 
post-HSCT. Subjects who were diagnosed with VOD were to be treated with defibrotide as rescue 
therapy and would then be censored from the prophylaxis analyses. Given that there were in total 90 
primary efficacy outcome events, the figures appear not to match. The MAH should clarify the number 
of events of VOD and deaths respectively that contributed to the primary efficacy endpoint (LoQ). 
The terminology used by the MAH is slightly inconsistent in the sense that data is labelled as 
“censored” in the context of VOD-free survival analysis and as “missing” in other contexts. While the 
terms are similar, the difference is that “missing” data is completely unknown and “censored” data 
partially unknown, i e for subjects censored at 30 days follow-up, it is known that the event did not 
happen before 30 days FU, which is more information compared to have no information at all (ie no 
event). This difference is relevant here because the results (primary efficacy endpoint – ITT analysis 
set, Table 6 above) show statistical test results from a log rank test comparing VOD-free survival times 
across the total follow-up time and the VOD-free survival rate by +30 post-HSCT as landmark time. 
While the logrank test uses all VOD-free survival times across the follow-up time, the VOD-free 
survival rate at landmark time by +30 post-HSCT uses a single timepoint for comparison. Therefore, 
the VOD-free survival rate at landmark time is not a completely consistent representation of the 
descriptive treatment effect on VOD-free survival times tested by the logrank test because the 
“estimand” is somewhat different between the survival rate analysis (ie difference in distribution of 
events) vs survival time analysis (ie difference in distribution of survival times). While it would be 
appropriate for a survival rate analysis  to label patients with “ has event” vs “ has no event” vs 
“missing”, for a survival time analysis the patients should be labelled as  “has event” vs “censored” 
would be appropriate. Censored data can be caused by end of follow-up without previous event or 
other intercurrent events which make the data not observable (eg study discontinuation). Given the 
large proportion of ‘other reason’ for censoring in the presentation of primary efficacy outcome events, 
the MAH is asked to present these other reasons in more detail, including any imbalance between 
treatment groups (LoQ). 
For the paediatric population (aged 16 and below), the difference between the VOD-free survival rate 
at landmark time +30 post-HSCT (69.2% in DP, 78.7 % in BSC, RR=1.45) and from the KM curve 
(62.5% in DP vs. 75%, RR=1.5) are similar but not identical, because the KM curve uses an estimation 
method adjusting for the patients no longer at risk of having an event at +30 post-HSCT, ie an 
adjustment for censored data. Overall, the effect sizes for Relative Risk (RR) from VOD-free survival 
rate =1.45, from KM with RR = 1.5 and from the Hazard Ratio from Cox PH =1.55 are reasonably 
consistent (attributing differences to differences in methods). 
The primary analysis and sensitivity analyses (except worst case analysis) show numerically increased, 
statistically non-significant risks for the DP group of around HR= 1.27. The worst-case (implausible) 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 46/194 
 
 
 
scenario gives a nominally statistically hazard ratio of HR =1.977 [CI95% 1.349, 2.897]. For the 
worst-case scenario, the MAH has used a “worst-case” imputation, which is also described in the 
“Statistical Analysis Plan” document (4.2.10, primary, 4.5.3.1 sensitivity analysis), where all censored 
patients imputed as having an event in the DP arm, but as no event (censored) in the BSC (control) 
arm. This assumption is not plausible, but a conservative assumption to estimate a lower boundary of 
the effect size. 
There was a clear discordance between the endpoint adjudication committee (EPAC) assessment and 
investigators’ assessment of VOD. Most cases adjudicated as VOD were not assessed as VOD by 
investigators. It is understood from the tables above that there were in total 85 adjudicated cases of 
VOD in the mITT population (all subjects in the ITT population who underwent HSCT), 47/179 in the 
defibrotide group and 38/174 in the BSC group. Of those, 50/85 were not assessed as VOD by 
investigators but were adjudicated by the EPAC; 4 cases were assessed as VOD by investigators but 
not by the EPAC. There was an imbalance between treatment arms in assessment of VOD, with more 
cases assessed as VOD by the EPAC only in the defibrotide group as compared to the BSC group. In 
addition to the overall discordance between the blinded EPAC and the non-blinded investigators, in the 
35 cases assessed as VOD by both investigators and EPAC, the date of VOD diagnosis did not match in 
two thirds of the cases. These data are interpreted in that there was a low recognition of VOD among 
investigators, especially in the open-label defibrotide treatment group. This is of particular interest 
given that this study had a blinded EPAC assessing all patients in the study, which has not been the 
case in previous defibrotide trials. 
As stated in the description of participant flow above, there were 56 subjects who developed VOD 
during the prophylaxis phase and received defibrotide as rescue treatment. The decision to start 
rescue treatment was based on the investigator’s assessment of VOD. However, it appears that there 
were in total 40 cases of VOD recognised by investigators. The MAH is asked to explain this 
discrepancy and to discuss the vast difference between investigators and EPAC assessments of VOD 
and date of VOD diagnosis in more detail, including the diagnostic criteria used and their clinical 
relevance (LoQ). 
The exact type of best supportive care used has not been presented. Since there was no prespecified 
BSC, it is unclear if there is any imbalance between treatment arms. Although there is no approved 
product for prophylaxis of VOD, a Cochrane review on prophylaxis of VOD from 2015 concluded that 
there was low or very low quality evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of 
hepatic VOD, all-cause mortality and mortality due to VOD in HSCT recipients. However, the optimal 
regimen is not well-defined. The Cochrane review also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to 
support the use of heparin, LMWH, defibrotide, glutamine, FFP, antithrombin III, and PGE1, and that 
further high-quality RCTs are needed. From the presentation of concomitant therapy (see Safety 
below), the majority of study subjects were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (310/372 or 83.3%) 
with a similar proportion in each treatment group; the assessment of concomitant therapy is however 
hampered by the non-consistent capture of concomitant therapy during the study (see below). 
Overall, these data show that defibrotide had no effect as compared to best supportive care for 
prophylaxis of VOD. This lack of efficacy does not translate into questioning efficacy for the approved 
treatment indication (the data on outcome of defibrotide treatment as rescue treatment for those who 
developed VOD are however of interest for the approved indication, see secondary endpoints below). 
The numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care for VOD-free survival both during the 
prophylaxis period of study 15-007 and more pronounced during the rescue treatment period are of 
concern, primarily from a safety perspective. The population studied is similar to the population 
covered by the approved indication, and these data should be seen in light of previous data on 
prophylaxis submitted within the MAA in 2013, in which the death rate was higher in the prevention

study when children who did not develop VOD and received DF were compared with subjects in the 
control arm who did not develop VOD. The MAH should discuss the apparent imbalance in mortality 
with defibrotide treatment, in relation to the approved indication (LoQ, safety MO). 
Since the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, the data on secondary efficacy endpoints are 
descriptive only. There are some worrying results regarding the key secondary efficacy endpoint with a 
numerical difference between treatment arms (VOD-free survival at Day +100 post HSCT of 49.8% in 
the defibrotide arm as compared to 57.1% in the best supportive care arm); even though the 95% CIs 
overlap and this is descriptive data only, there is thus a similar trend of worse outcome in the 
defibrotide group as for the primary efficacy outcome. 
What is further worrisome is the non-relapse mortality; again, since these are descriptive data, some 
caution is warranted. However, 22 of 147 participants (15.0%) in the DP arm and 11 of 139 
participants (7.9%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +100 post-HSCT. Of the participants with 
malignant primary disease history, 25 of 147 participants (17.0%) in the DP arm and 16 of 139 
participants (11.5%) in the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +180 post-HSCT. 
The data on participants diagnosed with VOD by Day 30 post-HSCT show resolution of VOD by day 180 
post-HSCT in 6/23 or 26.1% of subjects in the defibrotide arm and 15/29 or 51.7% of subjects in the 
best supportive care arm. The severity of the diagnosed VOD is not clear, thus it should be clarified if 
defibrotide was given in accordance with the Defitelio label (indicated in severe VOD only) or not 
(LoQ); however, the difference between treatment arms are considered to clearly disfavour those who 
had been treated with defibrotide for prophylaxis. The resolution rates appear to be in line with, or 
slightly lower than, what is described in literature for spontaneous resolution of VOD. It is assumed 
that all subjects who developed VOD as judged by investigator were treated with defibrotide regardless 
of treatment allocation for the prophylaxis phase; the MAH is asked to verify this assumption (LoQ). 
Also, since a large proportion of cases of VOD were defined by the EPAC (and assumed not to have 
been treated for VOD by investigators) the MAH should present the outcome in terms of resolution of 
VOD in those treated with defibrotide for rescue as compared to those who developed VOD but were 
not treated with defibrotide, both for the entire study population and divided by age group (paediatric 
subjects vs adults) (LoQ). 
For the additional secondary endpoints of health-related QoL; incidence of grades 2, 3 and 4 acute 
GvHD and incidence of chronic GvHD by Day 180 +HSCT; graft failure and time to neutrophil and 
platelet engraftment, these and the exploratory endpoints are discussed in the Safety section below. 
Overall, in line with the primary efficacy endpoint, descriptive data on the secondary efficacy endpoints 
indicate at best no effect of defibrotide but a possible unfavourable effect on VOD-free survival, non-
relapse mortality and resolution of VOD. 
Rapporteur’s conclusion on efficacy 
Study 15-007 was a randomised open-label study aimed at assessing the prophylactic effect of adding 
defibrotide to standard of care in a population with assumed (very) high risk of VOD while the risk of 
bleeding would be low. Prevention of VOD is not an approved indication for Defitelio. However, 
subjects included who developed VOD would receive defibrotide as rescue treatment, which is 
according to the label albeit for severe VOD only.  
The study was stopped after an interim analysis based on futility; 372 subjects were randomised which 
was nevertheless in line with the originally anticipated study size. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (VOD-free survival rate by Day +30 post-HSCT) was not met; there was 
no preventive effect of defibrotide on VOD-free survival day 30+ post-HSCT in the defibrotide group as 
compared to best supportive care. There was a numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care; 
Assessment report

this was particularly pronounced in the paediatric population. This is of concern, primarily from a safety 
perspective. The population studied is similar to the population covered by the approved indication, 
and these data should be seen in light of previous data on prophylaxis submitted within the MAA in 
2013, in which the death rate was higher in the prevention study when children who did not develop 
VOD and received DF were compared with subjects in the control arm who did not develop VOD. The 
MAH should discuss the apparent imbalance in mortality with defibrotide treatment (LoQ, safety MO). 
One strength of study 15-007 was the independent blinded assessment of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, which has not been done in previous defibrotide studies and demonstrating a large 
discrepancy between blinded, independent assessment of VOD and investigator’s assessment of VOD. 
Further clarifications are warranted regarding assessment of VOD, severity of VOD and outcome on 
VOD resolution in subjects treated with defibrotide as compared to those not treated with defibrotide. 
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Safety data collection in study 15-007 
For the safety analyses, 2 study phases were defined with respect to the administration of rescue 
defibrotide: 
•Prophylaxis Phase – For the overall safety population, this phase was defined as the period between 
baseline and start date of rescue defibrotide, if applicable, or the period between baseline and Day 
+180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred. (End date of Prophylaxis Phase = start date of rescue defibrotide 
– 1 or Day +180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred) 
•Treatment Phase – For the subset of patients in the safety population who developed VOD and 
received rescue defibrotide, this phase is defined as the period between start date of rescue defibrotide 
and Day +180 post-HSCT. (Start date of Treatment Phase = start date of rescue defibrotide) 
A TEAE was defined as any event with onset date on or after the first dose of study treatment (either 
DP or conditioning regimen) or any ongoing event that worsened in severity after the date of the first 
dose of study treatment through the protocol-specific reporting period. Only TEAEs with the onset date 
on or before the end of the protocol-specific AE reporting period were included in summary tables 
unless otherwise specified. For all AE summaries, if a patient has more than 1 AE within a preferred 
term, the patient is counted only once at the maximum severity and with the closest relationship to 
study drug. If a patient has more than 1 AE within a system organ class, the patient is similarly 
counted once when reporting results for that system organ class. 
7.2.  Results 
Patient exposure 
The Safety Analysis Set included 181 subjects randomised to the defibrotide arm who received at least 
1 dose of defibrotide and 174 subjects randomised to the best supportive care arm who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug (defibrotide or conditioning regimen).

The median (min, max) duration of treatment for participants in the DP arm during the prophylaxis 
phase of the study was 29.0 (1, 43) days (Table 6). The median (min, max) number of doses received 
was 111.0 (1, 172) doses and the median daily dose was 24.03 (0.0, 27.5) mg/kg/day. The median 
(min, max) duration of treatment during the rescue phase was 16.0 (1, 78) days in the DP arm and 
22.0 (1, 49) days in the BSC arm. The median (min, max) number of doses received was 61.0 (2, 284) 
and 82.0 (2, 192) in the DP and BSC, respectively, and the median daily dose was 23.06 (0.0, 26.5) 
and 23.23 (0.0, 25.9) mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Use of relevant prior medications were reported for most participants (333 of 372 participants 
[89.5%]; Table 14.1.7.1). The most frequently reported relevant prior medications overall were 
ursodeoxycholic acid (169 participants [45.4%]), Bactrim (125 participants [33.6%]), aciclovir (119 
participants [32.0%]), paracetamol (81 participants [21.8%]), and fluconazole (78 participants 
[21.0%]). 
Relevant concomitant medications reported in at least 50% of participants overall include aciclovir 
(319 participants [85.8%]), ursodeoxycholic acid (310 participants [83.3%]), paracetamol (307 
participants [82.5%]), furosemide (294 participants [79.0%]), ondansetron (238 participants 
[64.0%]), Bactrim (236 participants [63.4%]), magnesium sulfate (206 participants [55.4%]), 
filgrastim (201 participants [54.0%]), fluconazole (191 participants [51.3%]), and potassium chloride 
(186 participants [50.0%]). 
Due to an error in the original protocol and early versions of the ICFs, concomitant medications were 
not captured consistently in the clinical database. Per the EPAC, this inconsistent reporting did not 
impact their assessment of VOD, and concomitant medications were consistently captured in the 
pharmacovigilance database for reportable events described in the individual participant narratives 
(Section 11). The majority of participants received a conditioning regimen (354 of 372 participants 
[95.2%] overall). The most common conditioning regimens overall included fludarabine (186 
participants [50.0%]), busulfan (173 participants [46.5%]), cyclophosphamide (131 participants 
[35.2%]), antithymocyte immunoglobulin (127 participants [34.1%]), and melphalan (113 participants 
[30.4%]). The conditioning regimens for HSCT were generally similar across treatment arms. One 
participant received a conditioning regimen but did not undergo HSCT (Listings 16.2.1.1 and 16.2.6.3) 
and is not included in the mITT Analysis Set (Section 4.3).

Assessor's comment: 
Subjects in the best supportive care arm could receive defibrotide as rescue treatment for VOD. The 
median duration for rescue treatment was slightly shorter (16 days) than the recommended 
posology for severe VOD (minimum 21 days) in the defibrotide arm and 22 days in the BSC arm. As 
discussed above, it is assumed but should be verified that all subjects in the BSC arm who 
developed VOD as per the investigator’s assessment were treated with defibrotide (LoQ). 
For prior and concomitant medications, the presented data are in line with what could be expected 
for the population studied. It is however noted that concomitant medications were not consistently 
captured in the clinical database. This is not likely to have affected the incidence or assessment of 
VOD, for which no prophylactic treatment is approved, although ursodeoxycholic acid is often used 
(which was also used by more than 80% in the study in both treatment arms). For safety related to 
concomitant therapy, it is stated that concomitant medications were consistently captured in the 
pharmacovigilance database for reportable events. It is however unclear if treatment with other 
antithrombotic agents were consistently captured; since this is one of the safety concerns addressed 
by this study, the MAH should clarify whether subjects treated concomitantly with defibrotide and 
medications that increase the risk of haemorrhage were adequately captured, and provide outcome 
data in terms of VOD, bleeding events and TEAEs for these subjects (LoQ). 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are summarized by study phase and treatment arm in 
Table 12. During the prophylaxis phase of the study, all but 1 participant (DP arm) experienced 1 or 
more TEAEs. The proportion of participants with Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading 
to death were similar between the 2 treatment arms. Ten participants in each treatment arm 
experienced a TEAE leading to death. Treatment-relatedness was based on relatedness to defibrotide 
only (ie, relatedness to BSC was not assessed), and none of the TEAEs leading to death in the DP arm 
were considered treatment-related. During the rescue phase of the study, all participants experienced 
1 or more TEAEs. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to death were reported in 12 participants (48.0%) 
in the DP arm and 8 participants (25.8%) in the BSC arm. One participant in each treatment arm 
experienced a treatment-related TEAE leading to death.

Table 12. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events: Overall Summary – Safety Analysis Set 
Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
The most common TEAEs (those occurring in ≥ 20% of participants in either treatment arm) are shown 
for each study phase by treatment arm in Table 13. The most common TEAEs during the prophylaxis 
phase in the DP arm were Pyrexia (111 participants [61.3%]), Nausea (109 participants [60.2%]), 
Diarrhoea and Stomatitis (105 participants [58.0%] each), and Vomiting (103 participants [56.9%]). 
The incidence of these TEAEs were similar in the 2 treatment arms. The most common TEAEs during 
the rescue phase were VOD (14 participants [56.0%] in the DP arm, and 18 participants [58.1%] in 
the BSC arm), Pyrexia (6 participants [24.0%] in the DP arm, and 11 participants [35.5%] in the BSC 
arm), and Diarrhoea (7 participants [28.0%] in the DP arm, and 7 participants [22.6%] in the BSC 
arm). Note that the incidence of VOD as an AE is not identical to the number of cases of VOD reported 
in the efficacy analyses, as both the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were based on 
EPAC diagnosis. Furthermore, not all cases of VOD may have been reported as an AE by the 
investigator, as VOD was already captured as part of the efficacy analyses in this study.

Treatment-emergent AEs are summarized by SOC and PT and by treatment arm by age subgroup 
(pediatrics, ≤16 years of age; adults, >16 years of age) in Table 14.3.1.4. While some AEs were more 
common in one age subgroup versus the other, there were no trends observed when comparing the DP 
arm to the BSC arm to suggest a safety concern in either age subgroup. Assessor’s comment: Table 
14.3.1.4 presents a listing of all TEAEs divided by age group, using the total number of subjects in 
each treatment arm rather than the number of subjects in the age group as denominator for 
percentage calculations. No summary of the TEAEs in adults vs paediatric subjects has been provided. 
Treatment-related Adverse Events 
Treatment-related (per the investigator) TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 2% of participants in either 
treatment arm are summarized by SOC and PT for each study phase by treatment arm in

Table 14. Assessments of treatment relatedness were made only in the DP arm during the prophylaxis 
phase. 
During the prophylaxis phase, 41 participants (22.7%) in the DP arm experienced at least 1 treatment-
related TEAE. Those that occurred in ≥ 2% of participants in the DP arm included Epistaxis (8 
participants [4.4%]), and Haematochezia and Activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (4 
participants [2.2%] each). During the rescue phase, 7 participants (28.0%) in the DP arm and 6 
participants (19.4%) in the BSC arm experienced at least 1 treatment-related TEAE. The most 
common treatment-related TEAEs during the rescue phase were Epistaxis (1 participant [4.0%] in the 
DP arm, and 2 participants [6.5%] in the BSC arm), Haematuria (1 participant [4.0%] in the DP arm, 
and 1 participant [3.2%] in the BSC arm), and VOD (1 participant [4.0%] in the DP arm, and 1 
participant [3.2%] in the BSC arm).

Assessor's comment: 
During the prophylaxis phase of the study, all but 1 participant experienced 1 or more TEAE. This 
could be expected, given the severity of underlying disease and concomitant treatment and 
procedure (HSCT). It is stated that 10 subjects in each treatment arm had an TEAE leading to 
death; none of these deaths were considered related to defibrotide in the defibrotide arm. The 
number of deaths appear however not fully consistent with other presented analyses, see also 
Deaths below. 
During the rescue phase of the study, all participants experienced 1 or more TEAEs. Treatment-
emergent AEs leading to death were reported in 12 participants (48.0%) in the DP arm and 8 
participants (25.8%) in the BSC arm. In two subjects (assumed both to have been treated with 
defibrotide for rescue treatment) the TEAE leading to death was considered treatment-related. 
For the paediatric population, there are some difficulties to assess the safety data based on the 
presentation provided. The MAH is asked to provide a summary of the TEAEs and the treatment-
related TEAEs separated by children and adults using the number of children and adults respectively 
as the denominator when presenting percentages. Any differences between treatment groups as well 
as any differences between age groups should be addressed, including any implications for the 
labelling of adverse reactions (LoQ). 
TEAEs judged by investigator as treatment-related were reported for defibrotide only. Based on the 
presentation of treatment-related TEAEs occurring in ≥ 2% of Participants (safety analysis set), the 
treatment-related TEAEs are considered in line with the known safety profile of defibrotide and the 
current label for Defitelio. 
Serious adverse events 
During the prophylaxis phase, 74 participants (40.9%) in the DP arm and 61 participants (35.1%) in 
the BSC arm experienced 1 or more serious TEAEs. The most common serious TEAEs during the 
prophylaxis phase in the DP arm were Pyrexia (10 participants [5.5%]) and Respiratory failure (6 
participants [3.3%]). During the rescue phase, 16 participants (64.0%) in the DP arm and 22 
participants (71.0%) in the BSC arm experienced 1 or more serious TEAEs. The most common serious 
TEAEs during the rescue phase were VOD (8 participants [32.0%] in the DP arm, and 5 participants 
[16.1%] in the BSC arm), Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (3 participants [12.0%] in the DP arm, 
and 2 participants [6.5%] in the BSC arm), and Veno-occlusive liver disease (2 participants [8.0%] in 
the DP arm, and 3 participants [9.7%] in the BSC arm).

During the prophylaxis phase, 9 participants (5.0%) in the DP arm experienced a serious treatment-
related TEAE, with the most common being Gastrointestinal haemorrhage (3 participants [1.7%]) and 
Haematemesis (2 participants [1.1%]). During the rescue phase, 1 participant (4.0%) in the DP arm 
experienced a serious treatment-related TEAE (Haemorrhage intracranial), and 2 participants (6.5%) 
in the BSC experienced a serious treatment-related TEAE (1 participant [3.2%] each with Cerebellar 
haemorrhage and VOD).

Assessor's comment: 
There were slightly more subjects with at least 1 serious TEAE in the defibrotide arm as compared to 
BSC only, 74/181 (40.9%) vs 61/174 (35.1%) during the prophylaxis phase of the study. Of these, 
9 participants (5.0%) in the defibrotide arm experienced a serious treatment-related TEAE, with the 
most common being gastrointestinal haemorrhage/haematemesis (in total 5 participants). To aid in 
further assessment and since the prophylaxis phase included observational time up to D180 post-
HSCT (in subjects who did not develop VOD or died), the MAH is asked to present serious TEAEs 
occurring during the period when defibrotide was given for prophylaxis (up to D30 post-HSCT) by 
SOC and PT in both treatment arms, and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
(LoQ) 
During the rescue phase (assuming all 56 subjects included in this phase were treated with 
defibrotide), there were 16/25 or 64% TEAEs in patients randomised to prophylaxis with defibrotide 
and 22/31 or 71.0% TEAEs in patients randomised to prophylaxis with BSC. Of these, 3 participants 
experienced a serious treatment-related TEAE (1 each of intracranial haemorrhage, cerebellar 
haemorrhage and VOD). This is considered in line with the known safety profile of defibrotide, with 
cerebral haemorrhage being a labelled adverse reaction (frequency common) for Defitelio. 
Deaths 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to death are summarized by SOC and PT for each study phase by 
treatment arm in Table 16. 
During the prophylaxis phase, 10 participants (5.5%) in the DP arm and 10 participants (5.7%) in the 
BSC arm experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to death. The only TEAE leading to death that occurred in 
more than 1 participant overall was Respiratory failure (2 participants [1.1%] in each treatment arm). 
During the rescue phase, 12 participants (48.0%) in the DP arm and 8 participants (25.8%) in the BSC 
arm experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to death. The most common TEAEs leading to death were 
VOD (4 participants [16.0%] in the DP arm, and 2 participants [6.5%] in the BSC arm), Multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome (3 participants [12.0%] in the DP arm, and 2 participants [6.5%] in the BSC 
arm), Sepsis (1 participant [4.0%] in the DP arm, and 1 participant [3.2%] in the BSC arm), and 
Pneumonia (0 participants in the DP arm, and 2 participants [6.5%] in the BSC arm). 
There were no treatment-related TEAEs leading to death during the prophylaxis phase of the study. 
During the rescue phase, 2 participants (1 in each treatment arm) experienced a treatment-related 
TEAE leading to death. These events included Haemorrhage intracranial (DP arm) and VOD (BSC arm).

Post-hoc analyses of deaths 
All deaths reported during the study, including those that occurred outside of the protocol-defined AE 
reporting period, by Day +30, Day +100, and Day +180 post-HSCT are summarized by treatment arm 
in Table 17. For the participants who died by Day +30 post-HSCT, the cause of death was primarily 
due to AEs expected in patients undergoing transplant. By Day +100 post-HSCT, an additional 18 
participants in the DP arm and 15 participants in the BSC arm died. From Day +100 post-HSCT to Day 
+180 post-HSCT, 7 deaths in the DP arm and 10 deaths in the BSC arm were reported.

Assessor's comment: 
The numbers of deaths during study 15-007 as presented in the different analyses cannot be 
followed.  
According to the definition of ‘Prophylaxis Phase’ for safety evaluations, this phase was defined as 
the period between baseline and start date of rescue defibrotide, if applicable, or the period between 
baseline and Day +180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred. According to these data (Table 16 above), 
there were 10 participants in each treatment arm who suffered at least one TEAE leading to death 
during the prophylaxis phase, and 12 subjects in the defibrotide arm vs 8 subjects in the BSC arm 
who died due to TEAE during the rescue phase. Recurrent malignancies appear to have been 
included as a TEAE, and it is unclear if there were additional subjects who died during these phases 
(that were not reported as TEAEs). 
In the post-hoc analysis of deaths up to day 180 post-HSCT, however, 10 subjects in the defibrotide 
arm and 5 subjects in the BSC arm died by Day +30 post-HSCT (which was the time period during 
which defibrotide was administered in the defibrotide arm, and the time point for evaluation of the 
primary efficacy outcome). Up to day +180 post-HSCT, 35/190 subjects died in the defibrotide arm 
and 30/182 in the BSC arm out of which 23 deaths in each treatment arm had adverse events as 
primary cause of death. The MAH is asked to clarify why only 10 of these deaths were included in 
the presentation of TEAE leading to death during the prophylaxis phase (even adding those who 
were diagnosed with VOD and died due to adverse event, the figures are not congruent) (LoQ). In 
addition, the MAH should provide the total number of deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT divided by age 
groups (paediatric subjects vs adults) including causes of death (LoQ). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest included events in categories of pulmonary haemorrhage, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypersensitivity reactions. For either treatment arm, participant 
narratives were written for AESIs meeting any of the following criteria (Section 11): Grade >1 AESI or 
any grade if more than 1 AESI occurred, met serious criteria, assessed by the investigator as related 
to study treatment, led to a change in study drug (withdrawn or interrupted), and/or led to the 
participant discontinuing the study. 
Pulmonary Haemorrhage 
In the prophylaxis phase, 44 participants (24.3%) in the DP arm and 46 participants (26.4%) in the 
BSC arm experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of pulmonary haemorrhage 
(Table 14.3.1.17). The majority of the AEs reported were of Epistaxis in both the DP and BSC arms (39 
participants [21.5%] and 45 participants [25.9%], respectively). Excluding Epistaxis, the most 
common TEAEs in the DP arm were Haemoptysis (3 participants [1.7%]), Respiratory tract 
haemorrhage (2 participants [1.1%]), and Bronchial haemorrhage, Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage, 
and Pulmonary haemorrhage (1 participant [0.6%] each). In the BSC arm, excluding Epistaxis, 1 
participant (0.6%) experienced Pulmonary haemorrhage. In both treatment arms, the proportion of 
participants who experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of pulmonary 
haemorrhage during the prophylaxis phase was similar in the paediatric and adult subgroups. 
In the rescue phase, 4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm and 6 participants (19.4%) in the BSC arm 
experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of pulmonary haemorrhage (Table 
14.3.1.17). In the DP arm, these included 3 participants (12.0%) with Epistaxis (2 paediatrics and 1 
adult) and 1 participant (4.0%) with Haemoptysis (paediatric). In the BSC arm, these included 6 
participants (19.4%) with Epistaxis (5 paediatrics and 1 adult).

Gastrointestinal Bleeding 
In the prophylaxis phase, 16 participants (8.8%) in the DP arm and 14 participants (8.0%) in the BSC 
arm experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 
14.3.1.19). In both treatment arms of the prophylaxis phase, TEAEs of special interest in the category 
of gastrointestinal bleeding were experienced by a higher incidence of paediatric participants than 
adult participants (DP arm: 10 paediatric participants [5.5%], and 6 adult participants [3.3%]; BSC 
arm: 10 paediatric participants [5.7%], and 4 adult participants [2.3%]). 
In the rescue phase, 4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm and 6 participants (19.4%) in the BSC arm 
experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In the prophylaxis phase, 91 participants (50.3%) in the DP arm and 78 participants (44.8%) in the 
BSC arm experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of hypersensitivity reactions. 
In both treatment arms of the prophylaxis phase, TEAEs of special interest in the category of 
hypersensitivity reactions were experienced by a higher incidence of paediatric participants than adult 
participants (DP arm: 56 paediatric participants [30.9%], and 35 adult participants [19.3%]; BSC arm: 
46 paediatric participants [26.4%], and 32 adult participants [18.4%]). 
In the rescue phase, 8 participants (32.0%) in the DP arm and 1 participant (3.2%) in the BSC arm 
experienced 1 or more TEAEs of special interest in the category of hypersensitivity reactions. 
Assessor's comment: 
For adverse events of special interest, there was no difference in pulmonary or gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage between treatment arms during the prophylaxis phase.  
An imbalance is noted for hypersensitivity reactions, reported by 91 participants (50.3%) in the 
defibrotide arm and 78 participants (44.8%) in the BSC arm during the prophylaxis phase. A more 
pronounced difference is noted for the rescue phase, reported in 8 participants (32.0%) in the 
defibrotide arm and 1 participant (3.2%) in the BSC arm.  
For all three adverse events of special interest (which are also labelled adverse reactions for 
Defitelio), the reported event rates during rescue treatment appear higher than what would be 
expected based on the current label. The MAH should discuss these data in relation to the labelled 
frequencies and propose any label updates if warranted (LoQ). Also, since immunogenicity was an 
exploratory endpoint for which no data have been provided, given the difference between 
prophylaxis treatment arms in subjects who developed VOD and were treated with defibrotide, the 
MAH is asked to provide the immunogenicity data (LoQ). 
Other Safety Evaluations and Observations related to safety 
Vital sign results and changes from baseline are summarized by treatment arm for each phase of the 
study in Table 14.3.3.1. A shift table summarizing changes from baseline between low, normal, and 
high values at each assessment is provided in Table 14.3.3.3, and maximum increases/decreases from 
baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure are summarized in Table 14.3.3.2. There were no 
trends in either treatment arm suggesting a safety concern. Most participants had normal values at 
baseline, and values remained normal throughout the study.

Graft-versus-Host Disease 
Of the participants with allogenic donors, the proportion who were diagnosed with chronic GvHD by 
Day +180 post-HSCT were similar between the 2 treatment arms (14 of 147 participants [9.5%] in the 
DP arm, and 12 of 142 participants [8.5%] in the BSC arm). The proportion diagnosed with acute 
GvHD (Grade I-IV) by Day +180 post-HSCT was also similar between the 2 treatment arms (41 of 147 
participants [27.9%] in the DP arm, and 49 of 142 participants [34.5%] in the BSC arm). 
Graft Failure and Time to Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment 
Neutrophil engraftment was achieved by 156 participants (86.2%) in the DP arm and 162 participants 
(93.1%) in the BSC arm by Day +180 post-HSCT. The KM estimate (95% CI) of the median time to 
neutrophil engraftment is 17.0 (15.0, 18.0) days in the DP arm and 16.0 (14.0, 17.0) days in the BSC 
arm. 
Platelet engraftment was achieved by 154 participants (85.1%) in the DP arm and 163 participants 
(93.7%) in the BSC arm by Day +180 post-HSCT. The KM estimate (95% CI) of the median time to 
platelet engraftment is 24.0 (22.0, 26.0) days in the DP arm and 25.0 (21.0, 27.0) days in the BSC 
arm. Graft failure occurred in 4 participants (2.2%) in the DP arm and 3 participants (1.7%) in the 
BSC arm during the prophylaxis phase. During the rescue phase, 4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm 
and 3 participants (9.7%) in the BSC arm experienced graft failure. 
Karnofsky and Lansky Performance Scores 
Karnofsky and Lansky performance scores were high at baseline (median scores of 90.0 for both 
treatment arms and for both the Karnofsky and Lansky scores), indicating high functional status. Post-
HSCT scores were high or moderate during the prophylaxis phase and were generally similar between 
the 2 treatment arms. Scores were lower during the rescue phase, which was expected considering 
these participants had developed VOD. Karnofsky and Lansky performance status is summarized by 
participant in Listing 16.2.15. 
Abdominal Ultrasound 
Abdominal ultrasound results are provided by participant in Listing 16.2.16. 
Hospital Resource Utilization 
Duration of hospital stay was similar between the 2 treatment arms, with a median (min, max) 
hospital stay of 45.0 (1, 211) days in the DP arm and 47.5 (16, 193) days in the BSC arm (Table 
14.2.3.1). Resource utilization, including blood transfusion, ventilator use, dialysis, and number of 
biopsies, was generally comparable between the 2 treatment arms. Details on hospital and ICU stay 
and on inpatient resource utilization are provided by participant in Listings 16.2.17.1 and 16.2.17.2, 
respectively. 
Health-related Quality of Life 
For participants ≥ 16 years of age, EQ-5D-5L scores are summarized in Table 14.2.4.1. Across the 
dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L, conditions were unchanged from baseline in the majority of participants 
at Day +180 post-HSCT (Table 14.2.4.2). Similar results were observed in the 2 treatment arms. Post-
HSCT EQ VAS scores and change from baseline were similar between the 2 treatment arms (Table 
14.2.4.3). 
For participants ≥ 8 to ≤ 15 years of age and ≥ 4 to ≤ 7 years of age, EQ-5D-Y scores are summarized in 
Tables 14.2.4.4 and 14.2.4.7, respectively. Across the dimensions of the EQ-5D-Y in both paediatric 
age groups, conditions were unchanged from baseline in the majority of participants at Day +180 post-
HSCT, with the exception of anxiety in the ≥ 8 to ≤ 15 age group (Tables 14.2.4.5 and 14.2.4.8). In 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 67/194 
 
 
 
this age group, a similar proportion of participants had improved anxiety compared to unchanged 
anxiety (Table 14.2.4.5). In both paediatric age groups, similar results were observed in the 2 
treatment arms. In both paediatric age groups, post-HSCT EQ VAS scores and change from baseline 
were similar between the 2 treatment arms (Tables 14.2.4.6 and 14.2.4.9). 
Assessor's comment: 
For vital signs, the presentation of data is currently not sufficient. Of note, hypotension is one of the 
safety concerns addressed by this study. The MAH should summarise all vital sign variables recorded 
and present these for the respective treatment group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the 
prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue 
treatment period. These data should be provided for the overall study population (safety analysis 
set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
Chronic GvHD was diagnosed in slightly more participants with allogenic donors in the defibrotide 
arm as compared to the BSC arm by Day +180 post-HSCT (14/147 participants [9.5%] in the 
defibrotide arm, and 12/142 participants [8.5%] in the BSC arm). On the contrary, acute GvHD 
(Grade I-IV) by Day +180 post-HSCT was diagnosed in 41/147 participants [27.9%] in the 
defibrotide arm, and 49 of 142 participants [34.5%] in the BSC arm. GvHD not adjudicated by the 
EPAC but based on investigators’ assessments. 
Slightly lower engraftment occurred in the defibrotide arm: neutrophil engraftment was achieved by 
156/181 participants (86.2%) in the defibrotide arm and 162/174 participants (93.1%) in the BSC 
arm by Day +180 post-HSCT; platelet engraftment was achieved by 154 participants (85.1%) in the 
DP arm and 163 participants (93.7%) in the BSC arm by Day +180 post-HSCT. During the rescue 
phase, 4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm and 3 participants (9.7%) in the BSC arm experienced 
graft failure. The MAH is asked to discuss these findings on graft failure during the rescue phase in 
more detail, including any possible relation to defibrotide (LoQ). 
There were no differences between treatment arms regarding Karnofsky and Lansky performance 
scores, hospital resource utilization or health-related quality of life. For abdominal ultrasound 
results, no summary of data has been provided; the MAH is asked to provide a summary of the 
findings in each treatment group, for the overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided 
by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no clinically meaningful changes over time were observed for any haematology or chemistry 
laboratory parameter, and there were no notable differences in laboratory results between treatment 
arms. Table of selected laboratory results from baseline during each study phase is provided for the DP 
and BSC treatment arms in Tables 14.3.2.4.1 and 14.3.2.4.2, respectively. 
Haematology 
Given the condition of patients receiving HSCT, abnormal haematology parameters were expected 
during the course of the study. As such, shifts in haematology parameters to Grade 3 and Grade 4 
were observed during both the prophylaxis and rescue phases (Tables 14.3.2.4.1 and 14.3.2.4.2), but 
the quantitative nature of the shifts was similar between treatment arms (Table 14.3.2.1). Mean 
changes from baseline were similar between the treatment arms over time (Table 14.3.2.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 68/194 
 
 
 
 
 
Chemistry 
Shifts in chemistry parameters were similar between treatment arms during the prophylaxis and 
rescue phases of the study (Tables 14.3.2.4.1 and 14.3.2.4.2). Mean changes from baseline were also 
similar between the treatment arms over time (Table 14.3.2.2). 
Coagulation 
Mean changes from baseline in coagulation parameters were similar between the treatment arms over 
time (Table 14.3.2.3). 
Assessor's comment: 
For laboratory findings, the presentation of data is currently not sufficient. Coagulopathy is one of 
the safety concerns addressed by this study, and also the data on haematology and chemistry are of 
interest in line with the safety concerns (see below). The MAH should summarise the variables 
recorded for the laboratory findings and present these for the respective treatment group at baseline 
and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 post-
VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period. These data should be provided for the overall study 
population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
Immunological events 
The immunogenicity analysis will be reported separately. 
Assessor's comment: 
Immunogenicity is one of the safety concerns addressed by this study, of particular interest given 
the hypersensitivity data (see above). The immunogenicity analyses should be provided (LoQ). 
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
During the prophylaxis phase, 21 participants (11.6%) in the DP arm and 2 participants (1.1%) in the 
BSC arm experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. Of note, the 2 participants 
in the BSC arm, who were captured as having a TEAE leading to discontinuation during the prophylaxis 
phase, did not receive defibrotide during this time; the action taken with study treatment in these 
cases should have been captured as “not applicable”. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation that occurred in more than 1 participant overall during the prophylaxis phase included 
Epistaxis, n = 3 [1.7%] and Haemoptysis, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and Activated partial 
thromboplastin time, each n = 2 [1.1%]. Of the 21 participants in the DP arm with a TEAE leading to 
discontinuation, a majority (n = 16; 76.2%) had the event assessed as treatment related. The 
apparent imbalance in discontinuation due to TEAEs between the DP arm and the BSC arm is explained 
by the fact that participants in the BSC arm did not have TEAEs assessed as leading to treatment 
discontinuation during the prophylaxis phase as they did not receive defibrotide. 
During the rescue phase, a similar proportion of participants in the DP arm (24.0%) compared to the 
BSC arm (25.8%) experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to discontinuation. During this phase, Epistaxis 
was the only TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation that occurred in more than 1 participant 
overall (none in the DP arm; n = 2 [6.5%] BSC arm). Of the participants with a TEAE leading to 
discontinuation during the rescue phase, a similar percentage had the TEAE leading to discontinuation 
assessed as treatment related: n = 2 [8.0%] in the DP arm (n = 1 each with Rectal haemorrhage and 
Haemorrhage intracranial), and n = 3 (9.7%) in the BSC arm (n = 2 [6.5%] with Epistaxis and n = 1 
[3.2%] with Haematuria).

Assessor's comment: 
Discontinuations due to adverse events were applicable for the defibrotide arm only during the 
prophylaxis period. In the defibrotide arm, 21 participants (11.6%) discontinued defibrotide due to 
TEAEs, primarily due to bleeding events; only 16 of these TEAEs were however considered 
treatment-related. This discrepancy is not further pursued. 
During the rescue phase when assumably all participants received defibrotide, 6/25 (24.0%) in the 
defibrotide prophylaxis arm and 8/31 (25.8%) in the BSC arm had at least 1 TEAE leading to 
treatment discontinuation. Of these 14 participants, 7 had bleeding TEAEs. 
7.3.  Discussion 
The main safety concern is the numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care for VOD-free 
survival both during the prophylaxis period of study 15-007 and more pronounced during the rescue 
treatment period. The population studied is similar to the population covered by the approved 
indication and these data are in line with previous prophylaxis data indicating increased mortality with 
defibrotide treatment, especially in the paediatric population. The MAH should discuss the apparent 
imbalance in mortality with defibrotide treatment, in relation to the approved indication (LoQ). 
For the safety analyses, 2 study phases were defined with respect to the administration of rescue 
defibrotide: 
•Prophylaxis Phase – For the overall safety population, this phase was defined as the period between 
baseline and start date of rescue defibrotide, if applicable, or the period between baseline and Day 
+180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred. (End date of Prophylaxis Phase = start date of rescue defibrotide 
– 1 or Day +180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred) 
•Treatment Phase – For the subset of patients in the safety population who developed VOD and 
received rescue defibrotide, this phase is defined as the period between start date of rescue defibrotide 
and Day +180 post-HSCT. (Start date of Treatment Phase = start date of rescue defibrotide) 
Of note, however, during the ‘prophylaxis phase’, defibrotide was only administered up to at maximum 
Day +30 post-HSCT. Given the severity of underlying disease and concomitant treatments as well as 
the short half-life of defibrotide, safety data during and shortly after the administration of defibrotide 
are considered to have the strongest clinical impact. For the treatment phase, it is assumed but should 
be verified that all subjects in the BSC arm who developed VOD as per the investigator’s assessment 
were treated with defibrotide (LoQ). 
For prior and concomitant medications, the presented data are in line with what could be expected for 
the population studied. It is however noted that concomitant medications were not consistently 
captured in the clinical database. This is not likely to have affected the incidence or assessment of 
VOD, for which no prophylactic treatment is approved, although ursodeoxycholic acid is often used 
(which was also used by more than 80% in the study in both treatment arms). For safety related to 
concomitant therapy, it is stated that concomitant medications were consistently captured in the 
pharmacovigilance database for reportable events. It is however unclear if treatment with other 
medications that could increase the risk of bleeding were consistently captured; since this is one of the 
safety concerns addressed by this study, the MAH should clarify whether subjects treated 
concomitantly with defibrotide and medications that increase the risk of haemorrhage were adequately 
captured, and provide outcome data in terms of VOD, bleeding events and TEAEs for these subjects 
(LoQ).

Adverse events 
During the prophylaxis phase of the study, all but 1 participant experienced 1 or more TEAE. This could 
be expected, given the severity of underlying disease and concomitant treatment and procedure 
(HSCT). The majority of TEAEs were not considered treatment-related. During the rescue phase of the 
study, all participants experienced 1 or more TEAEs. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to death were 
reported in 12 participants (48.0%) in the DP arm and 8 participants (25.8%) in the BSC arm. In two 
subjects (assumed both to have been treated with defibrotide for rescue treatment) the TEAE leading 
to death was considered treatment-related. 
There were slightly more subjects with at least 1 serious TEAE in the defibrotide arm as compared to 
BSC only, 74/181 (40.9%) vs 61/174 (35.1%) during the prophylaxis phase of the study. Of these, 9 
participants (5.0%) in the defibrotide arm experienced a serious treatment-related TEAE, with the 
most common being gastrointestinal haemorrhage/haematemesis (5 participants in total). To aid in 
further assessment and since the prophylaxis phase included observational time up to D180 post-HSCT 
(in subjects who did not develop VOD or died), the MAH is asked to present serious TEAEs occurring 
during the period when defibrotide was given for prophylaxis (up to D30 post-HSCT) by SOC and PT in 
both treatment arms, and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
During the rescue phase (assuming all 56 subjects included in this phase were treated with 
defibrotide), there were 16/25 or 64% TEAEs in patients randomised to prophylaxis with defibrotide 
and 22/31 or 71.0% TEAEs in patients randomised to prophylaxis with BSC. Of these, 3 participants 
experienced a serious treatment-related TEAE (1 each of intracranial haemorrhage, cerebellar 
haemorrhage and VOD). This is considered in line with the known safety profile of defibrotide, with 
cerebral haemorrhage being a labelled adverse reaction (frequency common) for Defitelio. 
For the paediatric population, there are some difficulties to assess the safety data based on the 
presentation provided. The MAH is asked to provide a summary of the TEAEs and the treatment-
related TEAEs separated by children and adults using the number of children and adults respectively as 
the denominator when presenting percentages. Any differences between treatment groups as well as 
any differences between age groups should be addressed, including any implications for the labelling of 
adverse reactions (LoQ). 
For adverse events of special interest, there was no difference in pulmonary or gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage between treatment arms during the prophylaxis phase.  
An imbalance is noted for hypersensitivity reactions, reported by 91 participants (50.3%) in the 
defibrotide arm and 78 participants (44.8%) in the BSC arm during the prophylaxis phase. A more 
pronounced difference is noted for the rescue phase, reported in 8 participants (32.0%) in the 
defibrotide arm and 1 participant (3.2%) in the BSC arm.  
For all three adverse events of special interest (which are also labelled adverse reactions for Defitelio), 
the reported event rates during rescue treatment appear higher than what would be expected based 
on the current label. Haemorrhage is one of the safety concerns to be further characterised by this 
study. The MAH should discuss these data in relation to the labelled frequencies and propose any label 
updates if warranted (LoQ). Also, immunogenicity is also a safety concern to be further addressed by 
this study; given the difference in hypersensitivity between prophylaxis treatment arms (defibrotide vs 
BSC) in subjects who developed VOD and were treated with defibrotide, the MAH should provide the 
immunogenicity data that were captured but have not been presented (LoQ). 
Discontinuations due to adverse events were applicable for the defibrotide arm only during the 
prophylaxis period. In the defibrotide arm, 21 participants (11.6%) discontinued defibrotide due to

TEAEs, primarily due to bleeding events; only 16 of these TEAEs were however considered treatment-
related. This discrepancy is not further pursued. 
During the rescue phase when assumably all participants received defibrotide, 6/25 (24.0%) in the 
defibrotide prophylaxis arm and 8/31 (25.8%) in the BSC arm had at least 1 TEAE leading to 
treatment discontinuation. Of these 14 participants, 7 had bleeding TEAEs. 
Deaths 
Clarifications are warranted regarding the numbers of deaths during study 15-007 and the assessment 
of treatment-relatedness: 
According to the definition of ‘Prophylaxis Phase’ for safety evaluations, this phase was defined as the 
period between baseline and start date of rescue defibrotide, if applicable, or the period between 
baseline and Day +180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred. According to these data (Table 15 above), there 
were 10 participants in each treatment arm who suffered at least one TEAE leading to death during the 
prophylaxis phase, and 12 subjects in the defibrotide arm vs 8 subjects in the BSC arm who died due 
to TEAE during the rescue phase. Recurrent malignancies appear to have been included as a TEAE, and 
it is unclear if there were additional subjects who died during these phases (that were not reported as 
TEAEs). 
In the post-hoc analysis of deaths up to day 180 post-HSCT, however, 10 subjects in the defibrotide 
arm and 5 subjects in the BSC arm died by Day +30 post-HSCT (which was the time period during 
which defibrotide was administered in the defibrotide arm, and the time point for evaluation of the 
primary efficacy outcome). Up to day +180 post-HSCT, 35/190 subjects died in the defibrotide arm 
and 30/182 in the BSC arm out of which 23 deaths in each treatment arm had adverse events as 
primary cause of death. The MAH is asked to clarify why only 10 of these deaths were included in the 
presentation of TEAE leading to death during the prophylaxis phase (even adding those who were 
diagnosed with VOD and died due to adverse event, the figures are not congruent) (LoQ). In addition, 
the MAH should provide the total number of deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults) including causes of death (LoQ). 
Other Safety Evaluations and Laboratory findings 
For vital signs, the presentation of data is currently not sufficient. Of note, hypotension is one of the 
safety concerns addressed by this study. The MAH should summarise all vital sign variables recorded 
and present these for the respective treatment group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the 
prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue 
treatment period. These data should be provided for the overall study population (safety analysis set) 
and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
Chronic GvHD was diagnosed in slightly more participants with allogenic donors in the defibrotide arm 
as compared to the BSC arm by Day +180 post-HSCT (14/147 participants [9.5%] in the defibrotide 
arm, and 12/142 participants [8.5%] in the BSC arm). On the contrary, acute GvHD (Grade I-IV) by 
Day +180 post-HSCT was diagnosed in 41/147 participants [27.9%] in the defibrotide arm, and 49 of 
142 participants [34.5%] in the BSC arm. GvHD not adjudicated by the EPAC but based on 
investigators’ assessments. 
Slightly lower engraftment occurred in the defibrotide arm: neutrophil engraftment was achieved by 
156/181 participants (86.2%) in the defibrotide arm and 162/174 participants (93.1%) in the BSC arm 
by Day +180 post-HSCT; platelet engraftment was achieved by 154 participants (85.1%) in the DP 
arm and 163 participants (93.7%) in the BSC arm by Day +180 post-HSCT. During the rescue phase, 
4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm and 3 participants (9.7%) in the BSC arm experienced graft

failure. The MAH is asked to discuss these findings on graft failure during the rescue phase in more 
detail, including any possible relation to defibrotide (LoQ). 
There were no differences between treatment arms regarding Karnofsky and Lansky performance 
scores, hospital resource utilization or health-related quality of life. For abdominal ultrasound results, 
no summary of data has been provided; the MAH is asked to provide a summary of the findings in 
each treatment group, for the overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
For laboratory findings, the presentation of data is currently not sufficient. Coagulopathy is one of the 
safety concerns addressed by this study. The MAH should summarise the variables recorded for the 
laboratory findings and present these for the respective treatment group at baseline and at day 30 
post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for 
the rescue treatment period. These data should be provided for the overall study population (safety 
analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). (LoQ) 
Rapporteur’s conclusion on safety 
Several clarifications of the safety data are warranted before any conclusion on the safety profile of 
defibrotide in study 15-007 can be made. Although this study primarily addressed prophylaxis of VOD, 
the safety data are of importance also for the approved indication, since defibrotide was used for VOD 
rescue treatment (in line with the approved indication albeit for severe VOD only) and since the 
population studied (post-HSCT) is similar to the population covered by the approved indication. The 
main safety concern is the numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care for VOD-free survival 
both during the prophylaxis period of study 15-007 and more pronounced during the rescue treatment 
period; an in-depth discussion on this imbalance in relation to the approved indication and in light of 
previous data is warranted (MO). 
Study 15-007 is a Category 2 study in the Defitelio RMP, addressing the following safety concerns: 
Haemorrhage, Hypotension, Coagulopathy, Immunogenicity, Thromboembolic events, Patients treated 
concomitantly with defibrotide and medications that increase the risk of haemorrhage (including the 
newer oral anti-coagulants direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors), Patients with pre-existing liver or 
severe renal insufficiency (aetiologies other than VOD) and Patients with intrinsic lung disease. No 
clear presentation of data relating to each of these safety concerns has been provided; this is expected 
with the response to the RSI.  
Overall, the safety data from study 15-007 that are considered of most relevance are the data from 
the prophylaxis period when defibrotide was administered to subjects in the defibrotide arm (up to Day 
+30 post-HSCT), and the data from the rescue treatment period (when assumably all subjects 
diagnosed with VOD by investigators received defibrotide). Serious treatment-related TEAEs during 
both treatment periods include serious bleeding events, which could be expected given the known 
safety profile of defibrotide. However, it should be clarified when in the study and in what age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults) serious TEAEs occurred, given that the safety profile could differ 
between children and adults, and since the data on efficacy indicate worse outcome in the defibrotide 
arm especially in the paediatric population. 
Additional clarifications are also warranted regarding the frequency of adverse events of special 
interest (including any implications for the Defitelio label), deaths, graft failures and laboratory 
findings.

8.  PRAC advice 
At the meeting of PRAC held 2 – 5 May 2022, the draft DHPC and communication plan, as provided by 
the MAH on 28 April, 2022 and further commented by the rapporteurs were discussed by the PRAC.  
The PRAC noted the CHMP assessment of study 15-007, which is a study undertaken in a non-
approved population, but nevertheless is included in the RMP as a category 3 study. The PRAC also 
noted the conclusions drawn in the assessment report; that the main efficacy results from this study, 
together with the already well-established safety profile of defibrotide, further support that the 
benefit/risk balance for the use of defibrotide as prophylaxis for VOD after HSCT is negative.  
The PRAC also noted results from other procedures, such as variations II-48 and II-58, which point to 
relatively extensive off label use of defibrotide as prophylaxis for VOD after HSCT.   
Given the well-established safety profile, the lack of benefit as shown in study 15-007,  and the 
documented off label use as prophylaxis for VOD after HSCT, the PRAC agrees with the CHMP that 
there is a need to clearly communicate this to health care professionals.  The PRAC also finds is 
appropriate that health care professionals are advised not to use defibrotide as prophylaxis for VOD 
after HSCT, to protect such patients from harm without potential benefits of the exposure. Therefore, a 
revised DHPC is proposed, as available in an Annex. A revised draft communication plan is also 
provided.   
9.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes

Study 15-007 has been removed as additional pharmacovigilance activity for the safety concerns as

Annexes 
Annex 2 has been updated to move study 15-007 from ongoing to completed studies. 
Assessor's comment: 
Study 15-007 has been completed. Formally, removal of this study from the RMP could be accepted; 
however, there are several outstanding issues regarding the safety concerns (for which this study 
was one additional PhV activity) that warrant clarification within this procedure before the proposed 
RMP updates could be approvable. This includes haemorrhage, hypotension, coagulopathy, 
thromboembolic events, immunogenicity, concomitant treatments and patients with pre-existing 
liver disease/renal insufficiency/intrinsic lung disease. (LoQ) 
9.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP and the changes to the conditions and obligations of MA could be acceptable 
provided satisfactory responses to the request for supplementary information are submitted.  
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, the MAH proposes only to remove study 15-007 from the Opinion Annex II 
conditions as detailed in the recommendations section above. 
However, since previous prophylactic studies have been included in the SmPC and since study 15-007 
also includes study data on treatment with defibrotide for VOD, the SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 should 
be updated to include data from study 15-007. 
Additional amendments of the SmPC will depend on the responses to the RSI. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) should be updated accordingly.

11.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
Safety 
1.  There was a numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care for VOD-free survival both 
during the prophylaxis period of study 15-007 and more pronounced during the rescue treatment 
period. These data are in line with previous prophylaxis data indicating increased mortality with 
defibrotide treatment, especially in the paediatric population. These data may question the safety 
of defibrotide also in the approved indication considering that the populations studied in the 
prophylaxis studies are similar to the population covered by the approved indication. To further 
address the safety profile and in particular the apparent imbalance in mortality with defibrotide 
treatment, and to address this issue in relation to the approved indication, the MAH should: 
a. clarify the number of events of VOD and deaths respectively in study 15-007 that contributed 
to the primary efficacy endpoint for the entire study population and divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults) 
b. present the ‘other reasons’ for censoring in the presentation of the primary efficacy outcome 
events in more detail, including any imbalance between treatment groups 
c. provide the total number of deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT in study 15-007 divided by age 
groups (paediatric subjects vs adults) including causes of death. 
d. provide survival data separated by subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 who 
received defibrotide and those diagnosed with VOD who did not receive defibrotide 
e. clarify the severity of VOD in those who received VOD for rescue treatment, and provide 
survival data for severe VOD for the entire study population and divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults) 
f. discuss the above findings in relation to the totality of data on survival in subjects treated with 
defibrotide, both in prophylaxis studies and VOD-treatment studies, with a separate discussion 
on paediatric patients

11.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
2.  A clarification is warranted on the apparently discrepant number of subjects with VOD recognised 
by investigators and subjects who actually received defibrotide for VOD rescue treatment in study 
15-007. 
3.  The MAH should discuss the vast difference between investigators and EPAC assessments of VOD 
and date of VOD diagnosis in more detail, including the diagnostic criteria used and their clinical 
relevance. 
4.  The MAH should present the data on VOD-resolution in subjects diagnosed with VOD (including 
severity assessment) during study 15-007, divided by those who received defibrotide and those 
diagnosed vid VOD who did not receive defibrotide, for the entire study population and divided by 
age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
5.  One third of the ITT population in study 15-007 had major protocol deviations, primarily related to 
study “procedures/assessments”. The MAH should provide the most frequent reasons for deviation 
in study procedures/assessments and discuss the integrity of the study given the large number of 
major protocol deviations. 
Safety 
6.  The MAH should clarify whether subjects treated concomitantly with defibrotide and medications 
that increase the risk of haemorrhage were adequately captured in study 15-007, and provide 
outcome data in terms of VOD, bleeding events and TEAEs for these subjects. 
7.  A summary of the TEAEs and the treatment-related TEAEs in study 15-007 should be provided, 
separated by children and adults using the number of children and adults respectively as the 
denominator when presenting percentages. Any differences between treatment groups as well as 
any differences between age groups should be addressed, including any implications for the 
labelling of adverse reactions. 
8.  The MAH is asked to clarify why only 10 of the deaths that occurred in each treatment arm during 
the “prophylaxis phase” of study 15-007 were included in the presentation of TEAE leading to 
death up to day +180 post-HSCT; even when adding those who were diagnosed with VOD and 
died due to adverse events, the figures are not congruent with the overall presentation of death 
during the study. 
9.  For all three adverse events of special interest (pulmonary, haemorrhage, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, hypersensitivity) which are also labelled adverse reactions for Defitelio, the reported 
event rates during rescue treatment appear higher than what would be expected based on the 
current label. The MAH should discuss these data in relation to the labelled frequencies and 
propose any label updates if warranted. 
10. 
Immunogenicity was an exploratory endpoint for which no data have been provided. However, 
this is one of the safety concerns addressed by this study. Considering also the difference in 
hypersensitivity reactions between prophylaxis treatment arms in subjects who developed VOD 
and were treated with defibrotide, the MAH should provide the immunogenicity data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 78/194 
 
 
 
11. 
A summary of all vital sign variables recorded should be presented for the respective treatment 
group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD 
and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period. These data should be 
provided for the overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults). 
12.  During the rescue phase, 4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm and 3 participants (9.7%) in 
the BSC arm experienced graft failure. The MAH is asked to discuss these findings on graft failure 
during the rescue phase in more detail, including any possible relation to defibrotide.

For abdominal ultrasound results, no summary of data has been provided; the MAH is asked to 
provide a summary of the findings in each treatment group, for the overall study population 
(safety analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
14. 
A summary of the variables recorded for the laboratory findings should be presented for the 
respective treatment group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at 
diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period. These data 
should be provided for the overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults). 
15. 
For the additional safety concerns addressed by this study that are not covered by the above 
RSI, a summary of the main clinical findings should be presented. This pertains to thromboembolic 
events, patients with pre-existing liver disease, patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency and 
patients with intrinsic lung disease. Data should be presented for the respective treatment group 
at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at 
day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period, and should be provided for the 
overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs 
adults). 
SmPC 
16. 
Since previous prophylactic studies have been included in the SmPC and since study 15-007 
also includes study data on treatment with defibrotide for VOD as well as paediatric data, the 
SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 should be updated to include data from study 15-007.

12.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
Safety 
Question 1. There was a numerical imbalance in favour of best supportive care for VOD-free survival both during 
the prophylaxis period of study 15-007 and more pronounced during the rescue treatment period. These data are in 
line with previous prophylaxis data indicating increased mortality with defibrotide treatment, especially in the 
paediatric population. These data may question the safety of defibrotide also in the approved indication considering 
that the populations studied in the prophylaxis studies are similar to the population covered by the approved 
indication. To further address the safety profile and in particular the apparent imbalance in mortality with 
defibrotide treatment, and to address this issue in relation to the approved indication, the MAH should: 
a. clarify the number of events of VOD and deaths respectively in study 15-007 that contributed to the 
primary efficacy endpoint for the entire study population and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs 
adults) 
b. present the ‘other reasons’ for censoring in the presentation of the primary efficacy outcome events in 
more detail, including any imbalance between treatment groups 
c. provide the total number of deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT in study 15-007 divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults) including causes of death. 
d. provide survival data separated by subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 who received 
defibrotide and those diagnosed with VOD who did not receive defibrotide 
e. clarify the severity of VOD in those who received VOD for rescue treatment, and provide survival data for 
severe VOD for the entire study population and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults) 
f. discuss the above findings in relation to the totality of data on survival in subjects treated with defibrotide, 
both in prophylaxis studies and VOD-treatment studies, with a separate discussion on paediatric patients 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
1a. clarify the number of events of VOD and deaths respectively in study 15-007 that 
contributed to the primary efficacy endpoint for the entire study population and divided by 
age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults) 
The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 15-007 was veno-occlusive disease (VOD)-free survival at Day 
+30 post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) as per the independent Endpoint Adjudication 
Committee (EPAC). Note that the EPAC charter on evaluation of VOD was included as an appendix to 
the Study 15-007 clinical study report (CSR) submitted April 2021: Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Section 8.9.7. An event for the primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a VOD diagnosis (as 
assessed by the EPAC) or death from any cause, whichever occurred earlier, up to and including Day 
+30 post-HSCT. 
Overall, of 372 total participants included in the study, 90 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. 
Fifty participants (pediatric n=32, adults n=18) in the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm and 40

participants (pediatric n=20, adult n=20) in the best supportive care (BSC) arm contributed to the 
primary efficacy endpoint. 
Of the 90 participants, the majority of events were VOD (DP arm 94.0%; BSC arm 95.0%) and the 
rest were Death without VOD (DP arm n=3, BSC arm n=2). No substantial difference was observed 
between the treatment arms in the event rates that contributed to the primary endpoint overall or by 
age group.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified the number of deaths respectively that contributed to the composite primary 
efficacy outcome of VOD-free Survival by Day +30 post-HSCT. Of the 50 primary efficacy outcome 
events in the defibrotide group, 47 were VOD and 3 were deaths without VOD. The majority of events 
(N = 32) in the defibrotide group occurred among paediatric subjects (</=16 years of age); 31 of 
these were VOD and 1 was death without VOD. For best supportive care, there were 40 events; 38 
were VOD and 2 were deaths without VOD with a similar number of events among paediatric subjects 
as in adults (20 event each). 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.

1b. present the ‘other reasons’ for censoring in the presentation of the primary efficacy 
outcome events in more detail, including any imbalance between treatment groups 
The majority of participants who were censored in either the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm (84.3%) 
and the best supportive care (BSC) arm (83.1%) were censored for having “No VOD or No Death by 
Day +30 post-HSCT”. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 15-007 was veno-occlusive disease (VOD)-free survival at Day 
+30 post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) as adjudicated by the independent Endpoint 
Adjudication Committee (EPAC). An event for the primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a VOD 
diagnosis (as assessed by the EPAC) or death from any cause, whichever is earlier, up to and including 
Day +30 post-HSCT. VOD diagnosis by EPAC had the following options: VOD Yes/No; Not applicable 
(no HSCT), or Not evaluable. The adjudication process and adjudication criteria are described in the 
EPAC charter (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 8.9.7). Analysis of the primary endpoint, 
including reasons for censoring, is described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP; Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/CSR Section 8.8.6/SAP Section 10.1). 
A total of 140 participants (73.7%) in the DP arm and 142 participants (78.0%) in the BSC arm were 
censored in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.2.1.1).  
Table 19 below summarizes number and percent of participants in each treatment arm who were 
censored in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis and the reason for censoring. Censoring rules and 
rationale are pre-specified in the Statistical analysis Plan (SAP), Section 10.1. A higher percentage of 
participants in the DP arm compared to the BSC arm were censored because they were not evaluable 
by Day +30 post-HSCT (DP arm 6.4%; BSC arm 2.8%) or because the participant did not undergo 
HSCT (DP arm 7.9%; BSC arm 5.6%). Eleven (7.7%) participants in the BSC arm received defibrotide 
as rescue treatment but were not diagnosed with VOD by EPAC and were, therefore, censored for the 
primary endpoint analysis at the date of rescue treatment initiation. Further details of difference 
between EPAC and investigator assessment of VOD are described in response to Question 3. A small 
number (DP arm n=2, BSC arm n=1) were censored due to having VOD or dying prior to HSCT.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified the ‘other reasons’ for censoring. It is noted that in the table above, individuals 
without VOD (based on EPAC assessment) but were considered to have VOD by investigators and 
received rescue treatment with defibrotide are separated from the group ‘no VOD/death’; this is not 
considered appropriate as the assessment of VOD for the primary efficacy outcome events was solely 
based on the blinded EPAC assessment. 
There were more subjects who were not evaluable by Day +30 post-HSCT in the defibrotide group 
(6.4%) as compared to best supportive care (2.8%); further, there were more participants in the 
defibrotide group that did not undergo HSCT (7.9%) as compared to best supportive care (5.6%). 
Thus, at Day +30 post-HSCT include fewer evaluable subjects who had actually undergone HSCT in the 
defibrotide group as compared to best supportive care. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved; see also below for discussion on diagnosis of VOD by EPAC vs investigators. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
1c. provide the total number of deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT in study 15-007 divided by 
age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults) including causes of death. 
Listing 16.2.21 presents all deaths by Day +30 post-HSCT for each age subgroup (pediatric 
participants [≤ 16 years old] and adult participants [> 16 years]) by treatment arm and includes 
participant ID and relevant demographics, date of HSCT, date of death, and primary cause of death (as 
captured on the death electronic case report form [eCRF]), and any Grade 5 adverse event (AE), if 
reported on the AE eCRF. A participant could have had more than one Grade 5 AE recorded, and all are 
listed. 
Through Day +30 post-HSCT, a total of 15 participants died (defibrotide arm [DP] arm n=10 [5.7%]; 
Best Supportive Care [BSC] arm, n=5 [2.9%]). Of these 15 participants, 6 were pediatric participants 
(DP arm n=4; BSC arm, n=2), and 9 were adult participants (DP arm n=6; BSC arm, n=3). None of 
the causes of death were assessed by the investigator as related to defibrotide treatment. Further 
details regarding the 6 pediatric participants included in this analysis who died (DP arm n=4; BSC arm, 
n=2) by Day +30 post-HSCT are as follows: 
• 
DP arm: 1 participant died due to Candida sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) 
syndrome; 1 participant cause of death included Haemorrhage intracranial, 1 participant died from 
Histiocytosis haematophagic, and 1 participant due to Pseudomonal sepsis. 
• 
BSC arm: 1 participant died due to Respiratory failure and 1 from Pulmonary haemorrhage. 
No pediatric participant died from VOD in either arm of the study by Day +30 post HSCT. 
A total of 9 adult participants died (DP arm n=6; BSC arm, n=3) by Day +30 post-HSCT. Further 
details regarding cause of death for adult participants are as follows: 
• 
DP Arm: causes of death included MOD syndrome with VOD (n=1), VOD (n=1), Posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome (n=1), Septic shock (n=1), Acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent 
(n=1), and 1 participant had 3 AEs reported as Grade 5/fatal (Acute kidney injury, Bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis, and VOD). For this last participant (Participant ID 8205-1001), the coded Preferred Term 
(PT) of VOD was captured as a cause of death (Listing 16.2.21), yet the AE verbatim term was 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 83/194 
 
 
 
 
reported as “early VOD” (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.10.5). On Day +8 post-HSCT, 
the participant experienced Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Acute kidney injury, and on the same 
day, the participant was diagnosed with VOD-associated MOD (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 
16.2.8.2). On Day +18 post-HSCT, the participant experienced Grade 5 serious adverse events of 
Venooclusive disease, worsening of Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and Acute kidney injury. 
 • 
BSC Arm: Causes of death for the 3 adult participants in the BSC included MOD syndrome with 
VOD, Pneumonia, and Sepsis (n=1 each). Of the Grade 5 AEs, none were assessed by the investigator 
as related to defibrotide treatment (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.10.5). 
Individual participant narratives describing all deaths (through Day +180 post-HSCT) are provided in 
Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 11. 
The MAH would like to clarify that the total number of deaths by Day +30 post-HSCT in this analysis 
(pediatric n=6, adult n=9) appears different from the total number of deaths (pediatric n=3, adult 
n=2) presented in response to Question 1a. The reason for this is that, per the protocol and statistical 
analysis plan, the definition of an event that contributed to the primary endpoint was VOD or death 
from any cause, whichever is earlier, up to and including Day +30 post- HSCT (response to Question 
1a). Therefore, only deaths that occurred first (DP arm n=3, BSC arm n=2) contributed to the primary 
endpoint, while all deaths (including the 5 deaths that contributed to the primary endpoint) from any 
cause in all participants that occurred by Day +30 post HSCT are included in this response. 
In summary the number of deaths, overall and by age group, were comparable between the 2 
treatment arms in the study. Our data are consistent with what has been published in the literature 
regarding the main causes of mortality post-HSCT (particularly allogeneic) being primary disease 
relapse, early treatment-related mortality, including infections, toxicity, and graft-vs-host disease 
(Styczyński 2020). The participants who died by Day +30 post-HSCT in this study had causes of death 
that were primarily due to transplant-associated adverse events and are consistent with reported 
evidence on early mortality post-HSCT. 
Reference: Styczyński J, Tridello G, Koster L et al,. Death after hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation: changes over calendar year time, infections and associated factors. BMT (2020) 
55:126–136. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
There were 10 deaths up to day 30-post-HSCT in the defibrotide group and 5 in the best supportive 
care group. Of these, 6 were paediatric participants (defibrotide group, n=4; best supportive care 
group, n=2), and 9 were adult participants (defibrotide group n=6; best supportive care group, n=3). 
It is stated that no paediatric participant died from VOD in either arm of the study by Day +30 post 
HSCT; however, at least one child died due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in the defibrotide 
group during this period. Further, one child died due to intracranial haemorrhage (which is a labelled 
adverse event for defibrotide). 
Apparently, given the difference between total number of deaths and deaths contributing to the 
primary efficacy outcome, there majority of deaths occurred in subjects who were first diagnosed with 
VOD and then died (7 subjects in the defibrotide group and 3 subjects in the best supportive care 
group). 
Conclusion 
Issue partly resolved; further discussion on mortality requested.

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
1d. provide survival data separated by subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 
who received defibrotide and those diagnosed with VOD who did not receive defibrotide 
The MAH would like to highlight that survival analysis, as requested by the Agency, separated by 
participants diagnosed with VOD during Study 15-007 who received defibrotide and those diagnosed 
with VOD who did not receive defibrotide, is not feasible nor a valid comparison. The reason is 
described as follows: 
Per study 15-007 protocol, the analysis was based on the blinded Endpoint Adjudication Committee 
(EPAC) assessment of VOD. EPAC assessment of VOD was done retrospectively based on electronic 
forms, and it did not influence the decision regarding participants receiving defibrotide rescue 
treatment, which was made by the Principal Investigator (PI). Defibrotide rescue treatment was 
administered to participants only based on clinical assessment and diagnoses of VOD by the PI. All 
participants who were diagnosed with VOD based on PI assessment (n=57) received defibrotide rescue 
treatment, except for 1 participant who was withdrawn from the study before receiving defibrotide 
rescue treatment. 
A total of 96 participants were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC: 
• 
Of these 96 participants, 38 were also diagnosed with VOD by the PI (100% concordance, 
Question 3) and received defibrotide rescue treatment. This group (n=38) represents those with VOD 
who received defibrotide rescue treatment. 
• 
The remaining 58 participants (n=96-38) who were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC but who were 
not diagnosed by the PI and did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment. These participants most 
likely did not experience clinical VOD warranting treatment. 
This clinical study was designed to test the potential for defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) to prevent VOD 
and included a provision for participants with a VOD diagnosis according to the PI to receive rescue 
therapy with defibrotide (25 mg/kg/day) in either the DP and BSC arms of the study. It was not 
designed to evaluate defibrotide in the treatment of VOD. The study was not randomized at the rescue 
phase for those participants who developed VOD; therefore, based on EPAC retrospective assessment 
of VOD, 2 different groups resulted 1) a VOD group (diagnosed by both EPAC and PI) and treated with 
rescue defibrotide and 2) a group with VOD diagnosis only (by EPAC) who did not receive defibrotide 
rescue treatment. The latter group likely did not experience clinical VOD, hence, cannot be considered 
“VOD who did not received defibrotide treatment” but rather, “no VOD who did not receive defibrotide 
rescue treatment”. Therefore, a treatment comparison is not valid. As evidenced from the literature, 
patients diagnosed with VOD have a much poorer prognosis than patients not diagnosed with VOD 
(Coppell 2010).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH argumentation that EPAC adjudicated VOD was not actually VOD cannot be followed. Based 
on this argumentation, the entire study design would be questioned as VOD adjudicated by the EPAC 
formed the basis for the primary efficacy outcome assessment. The very strength of this study is the 
blinded external adjudication committee. This is also a strength that appears unique for this defibrotide

study since previous defibrotide studies have not had any blinded assessments. There is a clear 
discordance between VOD as assessed by investigators and VOD as assessed by a blinded external 
committee. The discordance was most pronounced among subjects who received defibrotide, which 
could implicate a potential bias among the open-label investigators. 
According to the protocol, it is understood that both investigators and the EPAC were to apply modified 
Seattle criteria for the assessment/diagnosis of VOD. All data of interest was provided to the EPAC as 
outlined in Q3 below. There is no data or discussion on e.g., potential differences in severity of VOD 
that could have affected the outcome (see also assessment of Q3 below). 
This question is of clear interest to assess the safety profile of defibrotide also for the approved 
indication and the requested data should be provided. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. The requested data should be provided. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
1e. clarify the severity of VOD in those who received VOD for rescue treatment, and provide 
survival data for severe VOD for the entire study population and divided by age groups 
(paediatric subjects vs adults) 
The MAH would like to clarify that in the Agency request above, the phrase “…who received VOD for 
rescue treatment, …” is interpreted by the MAH to indicate “…who received defibrotide for rescue 
treatment…” 
A total of 56 subjects received rescue treatment, 30/56 (54%) were pediatric and 26/56 (46%) were 
adult participants. (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.1.2.3). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was 
not classified by severity in the Study 15-0007; therefore, we are providing data on VOD cases with 
Multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). Of those with VOD, 19/56 (34%) (pediatrics n=10, adult n=9) had 
VOD with MOD (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15- 007/Table 14.2.2.5 and Listing 16.2.8.2). The remaining, 
37/56 (66%) (pediatric n=20, adult n=17) had VOD with no MOD. 
Per Study 15-007 protocol, the primary endpoint analysis was based on the blinded Endpoint 
Adjudication Committee (EPAC) assessment of VOD; however, the severity of VOD was not defined per 
protocol nor per EPAC charter. Participants with severe VOD could only be identified if they had 
concomitant VOD-associated MOD reported based on investigator assessment. 
A total of 19 participants (pediatric n=9 and adult n=10) who were diagnosed with VOD by the 
Principal Investigator (PI), and had a VOD associated MOD reported in eCRF, were also diagnosed with 
VOD by EPAC (100% concordance). These 19 participants were the total number of participants in the 
study population (n=372) who had reported VOD associated MOD, and as such can be considered as 
severe VOD (VOD with MOD) and all received rescue treatment with defibrotide. The 19 participants 
with VOD with MOD comprised 20% (n=19/96) and 33% (n=19/57) of the total participants diagnosed 
with VOD by the EPAC and PI, respectively. 
Survival in participants with VOD with MOD for the entire study population and divided by age group 
A survival analysis for participants with severe VOD who received defibrotide rescue treatment is 
provided in Table 20 below by treatment arm and by pediatric or adult. The analysis was performed 
from the date of VOD diagnoses for each participant. Of the 19 participants who were diagnosed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 86/194 
 
 
 
severe VOD described above, 18 participants were included in this analysis. One participant was 
excluded due to the date of VOD diagnosis by EPAC after completion of defibrotide rescue treatment, 
which was initiated by the PI. 
Overall, 9 of the 18 (50%) participants with VOD with MOD died. For the overall population with VOD 
with MOD, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate of median survival time in days was 99.0 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 25.0, not estimable [NE]).  In pediatric participants, 4/10 (40%) died with a KM estimate 
of median survival time in days of 146.0 (95% CI 12.0, NE). In adult participants, 5/8 (62.5%) died 
with a KM estimate of median survival time in days of 47.0 (95% CI 9.0, NE). In summary, the 
estimated proportion of participants who were diagnosed with VOD with MOD (19 to 33%) is in line 
with evidence from published literature (Coppell 2010).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The majority of subjects who received defibrotide for treatment of VOD had no multi-organ 
dysfunction/failure. When defibrotide was approved, severe VOD was defined as VOD with MOD/MOF. 
Since then, the terminology has changed, see also introduction; severe VOD in adults is diagnosed 
according to the following (Mohty et al 2016; at least two criteria are required): time since first clinical 
symptoms of VOD =/< 4 days, bilirubin (μmol/L) between 85 and 136, bilirubin levels doubling within 
48 h, transaminases more than 5 and less than 8 x UNL, weight increase between 5 and 10% and 
renal function impaired by more than a factor 1,5 and less than 2 as compared to at transplant. Of 
note, with these criteria, patients are not required to have multi-organ dysfunction/failure to be 
classified as ‘severe’ – if multi-organ failure is present, the patient is classified as very severe VOD. For 
severe VOD in paediatric patients, the following criteria are included: liver function tests > 5 x 
ULN, persistent refractory thrombocytopenia > 7 days, bilirubin (μmol/L) >34, ascites with necessity 
for paracentesis, impaired coagulation and impaired renal function with GRF (mL/min) 29-15, need for 
invasive pulmonary ventilation and normal CNS function (Corbacioglu 2018). Also for paediatric 
patients, if MOD/MOF is present, the severity is graded as ‘very severe’. 
Based on the protocol, it would likely be possible to assess the severity of VOD in those who received 
defibrotide for rescue treatment during the initial +30 days post-HSCT, since extensive clinical 
laboratory testing including parameters of interest were scheduled for daily sampling during 
hospitalization, as were weight, physical examination/vital signs and hospitalization data. Assessments 
of VOD and VOD-associated MOD were scheduled twice weekly during the initial +30 days and weekly 
up to day +60. Although it is recognized that the terminology was changed at the same time that this 
study was initiated (or during the study for paediatric patients), an attempt to discuss the outcomes in 
patients treated with defibrotide based on severity of VOD would have been appreciated to this aid in 
assessing outcomes based on the current label and thus the appropriateness of the current label. 
However, the MAH states that the severity of VOD was not defined per protocol nor per EPAC charter. 
The Table 20 above is thus interpreted to actually be participants with VOD as per EPAC that had MOF 
as per investigators’ assessments. 
The presented data on survival in subjects with VOD with multiorgan dysfunction are thus representing 
patients with ‘very severe VOD’ based on current terminology. All these subjects received defibrotide 
for rescue treatment. The grouping into defibrotide arm and best supportive care is based on the initial 
randomization. It is found worrisome that initial randomization to defibrotide was apparently 
associated with a shorter median survival time in subjects who developed VOD with MOD and who 
were treated with defibrotide.

1f. discuss the above findings in relation to the totality of data on survival in subjects 
treated with defibrotide, both in prophylaxis studies and VOD-treatment studies, with a 
separate discussion on paediatric patients 
Study 15-007 was an adaptive design Phase 3 clinical study (15-007) comparing the efficacy and 
safety of defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) versus best supportive care (BSC) in the prevention of hepatic 
veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in adult and pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) who are at high risk or at very high risk of developing VOD. Study 15-007 was a 
Post- Marketing Requirement (PMR)/ Specific Obligation to collect additional data to support the safety 
of defibrotide in a randomized multicenter clinical trial. The prevention Study 15-007 was used for this 
PMR due to ethical limitations in performing randomized studies in the treatment of VOD, a critical 
condition with a mortality of > 80% if left untreated, and to collect such safety data given the 
availability and the established efficacy of defibrotide as a valid treatment option. 
Prior data suggested that defibrotide could be effective in preventing VOD. Several studies have 
previously shown the benefit of defibrotide in prophylaxis of VOD vs standard of care (Corbacioglu 
2012, Chalandon 2004, Zhang 2004). In addition, a more recent pooled analysis was conducted using 
19 studies totaling 2929 participants that evaluated intravenous (IV) defibrotide for VOD/SOS 
prophylaxis (Corbacioglu 2021). In this metanalysis, the overall VOD/SOS incidence with IV defibrotide 
was 5%, (5% incidence of VOD in adults and 8% in pediatric patients). In 8 studies evaluating IV 
defibrotide prophylaxis versus controls (eg, heparin, no prophylaxis), VOD/SOS incidence in controls 
was 16%. The risk ratio for developing VOD/SOS with defibrotide prophylaxis versus controls was 0.30 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12, 0.71; p=0·0002). The current study 15-007 was based on the 
earlier evidence, albeit with confounding factors in the study design, discussed herein, which need to 
be taken into consideration in interpreting the results and comparison to earlier studies in defibrotide 
prevention of VOD. 
In April 2020, new enrolment into the study was stopped due to futility. The decision for early stopping 
was based on a recommendation from an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after a pre-
planned interim analysis on the first 280 patients randomized in the study. The DMC concluded that 
the study was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint should enrollment continue to the total of 400 
participants originally planned or increase in size. The DMC conducted multiple periodic safety analyses 
during the study and reported no new safety concerns, including the point at which the IDMC 
recommended stopping the trial for futility with respect to the primary endpoint. Defibrotide was well 
tolerated in this study when given as prophylaxis for patients at high risk/very high risk of developing 
VOD. 
The final analysis of study 15-007, based on a total of 372 randomized participants (pediatric n=198, 
adults n=174), showed that the safety data between the 2 arms (defibrotide prophylaxis [DP] and best 
supportive care [BSC]) of the study, were comparable. A comparable percentage of subjects 
experienced any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to Death 
and AESIs (AEs of Special Interest). No new adverse reactions were identified, and there were no 
changes to the frequencies of previously identified adverse reactions in either treatment arm of the 
study, including pediatric patients. The number of deaths in the study population are comparable 
between the 2 study treatments arms. The Agency is referred to Question 1c and safety questions. The 
safety results of the study are consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide in treatment and 
also the published literature on defibrotide in prophylaxis. 
Design and confounding factors 
The efficacy endpoint in Study 15-007, evaluating defibrotide in the prevention of VOD, was added 
based on evidence from earlier studies (Corbacioglu 2012, Chalandon 2004, Zhang). It is worth 
highlighting that: Study 15-007 was powered to detect a difference in prevention of VOD with DP vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 89/194 
 
 
 
BSC; it was not powered nor designed to detect a difference in treatment arms nor evaluate the 
benefit of defibrotide per se in the treatment of VOD. Study 15-007 had a lower number of paediatric 
participants (n=198) compared to the earlier paediatric prevention study (n=356) (Corbacioglu 2012), 
on which our study was based. 
In addition, several factors inherent in the design of Study 15-007 limit the potential for post-hoc 
analyses such as for Question 1d, and also limit the potential for cross- study comparisons to prior 
studies showing defibrotide benefit in prevention of VOD. Per Study 15-007 protocol, the analysis was 
based on the blinded Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC) assessment of VOD; however, rescue 
defibrotide treatment was administered only when VOD was diagnosed by Principal Investigators. EPAC 
assessment of VOD was done retrospectively, and it did not influence the PI's decision to administer 
defibrotide treatment in participants who developed VOD during the study. Extensive or detailed data 
on disease status, details of transplant source and were not appropriately captured nor analyzed. The 
vast difference between PIs’ and EPAC assessments of VOD, as it was also noted by the Agency 
(Question 3), resulted in 2 different subgroups of participants (VOD treated with defibrotide vs VOD 
not treated with defibrotide) that are considered not comparable. Participants who were assessed with 
VOD by EPAC and not by the PI likely did not experience a clinical case of VOD. As such a comparison 
between those who received and did not receive DP among EPAC designated VOD participants is not 
appropriate. 
At the final analysis, the study primary endpoint of VOD-free survival at Day+30, based on EPAC 
assessment of VOD, was consistent with the conclusion from the DMC at the interim analysis, ie, VOD-
free survival by Day +30 post HSCT was similar in the DP arm compared to BSC (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007/Section 5.1.1.1).  
However, it is worth noting that VOD-free survival at Day +30 post HSCT based on PI diagnosis of VOD 
was numerically higher in the DP arm vs BSC, though not statistically significant (see response to 
Question 3). 
In summary, the study provided additional safety data on defibrotide in a randomized setting, to fulfill 
the Specific Obligation. The safety results from this study are consistent with the defibrotide safety 
profile in treatment of VOD and evidence from earlier prevention studies. No comparison on the 
efficacy in the treatment of VOD can be made.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
This request was a discussion of the totality of data on survival in subjects treated with defibrotide, 
both in prophylaxis studies and VOD-treatment studies, with a separate discussion on paediatric 
patients. No discussion on survival has been provided, only a statement that ‘the number of deaths in 
the study population are comparable between the 2 study treatments arms’ which appears incorrect as 
there were twice as many deaths in the defibrotide arm as in the best supportive care arm, see Q1c. 
The SOB pertaining to this study explicitly points out that comparative safety data are expected from 
this study; since these data indicate a higher mortality in participants treated with defibrotide, the 
mortality data from this study should be discussed in relation to previous data on survival both in 
prophylaxis studies and VOD-treatment studies, with a separate discussion on paediatric patients. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. The requested discussion should be provided. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

Clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
Question 2 A clarification is warranted on the apparently discrepant number of subjects with VOD recognised by 
investigators and subjects who actually received defibrotide for VOD rescue treatment in study 15-007. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Per Study 15-007 protocol, all participants who were diagnosed with VOD, as per Principal Investigator 
(PI) assessment, in both defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) and best supportive care (BSC) arms, received 
defibrotide rescue treatment, except 1 participant who withdrew from study (please see below). As 
such, no discrepancies are noted. 
Overall in study 15-007, a total of 57 participants (57/372, 15.3%) experienced veno-occlusive disease 
(VOD) by Day +180 post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) as diagnosed by the PI (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.7.3). Of these, 56 participants received defibrotide as rescue 
therapy: 25 participants (25/190, 13.2%) in the DP arm and 31 participants (31/182, 17.0%) in the 
BSC arm (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.1.2.3 and Figure 2). 
One participant 8108-1002, in the BSC arm, was diagnosed with VOD by the PI and subsequently 
withdrew from the study, based on PI decision, hence rescue defibrotide treatment was not 
administered. 
In summary, there are no discrepancies noted. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The reasoning behind this request was clearly outlined in the AR, pertaining to the presented data on 
investigators’ assessment of VOD vs EPAC assessment which contrasts with the presentation of 
participant flow. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 91/194 
 
 
 
The MAH asked for a clarification on this topic after the circulation of the LoQ in July 2021; the 
Rapporteur then replied through a letter to the EMA at 15th July 2021: it remains unclear why it 
appears in the participant flow that there were 56 subjects who developed VOD during the prophylaxis 
phase and received defibrotide as rescue treatment, whereas the decision to start rescue treatment 
based on the investigator’s assessment of VOD was noted in 40 cases of VOD recognised by 
investigators (Table 11 in AR from CSR Table 14.2.1.11). A further explanation with the responses to 
the RSI is warranted. 
Despite this, no response to this question has been submitted. However, is assumed that the 
discrepancy is due to meaning ‘prophylaxis phase’ as up to Day +180 post-HSCT (or up to Day +100 
post-HSCT, see Q4 below) whereas the data on investigator’s assessment of VOD pertains to up to Day 
+30 post-HSCT only (see Q4 below). It is noted that there appears to be remaining inconsistencies 
with regards to the number of VOD-events as per the investigators’ assessment, see Q4 below. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved; further pursued based on assessment of Q4, see below. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 3 The MAH should discuss the vast difference between investigators and EPAC assessments of VOD and 
date of VOD diagnosis in more detail, including the diagnostic criteria used and their clinical relevance. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Per protocol, diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was based on Modified Seattle Criteria (MSC) 
by both blinded EPAC and the PI. The blinded EPAC based their assessment of VOD up to Day +100 
post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), per the MSC and on clinical data and information that 
were provided to them electronically for a retrospective analysis. 
A total of 96 participants (DP arm n=53, BSC arm n=43) were assessed to have VOD by the EPAC by 
Day +100 post-HSCT ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 92/194 
 
 
 
 
Table 21). Overall, a total of 56 (DP arm n=25, BSC arm n=31) participants were diagnosed as VOD 
by PI by Day +100 post-HSCT (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.7.3). 
The EPAC and PI were concordant, in the assessment of VOD, on a total of 190 (53.8%) participants, 
of which the concordance on the presence of VOD was on 38 (38/353, 10.8%) participants (Table 4). 
Discordance between PI and EPAC was on 132 (37.4%) participants. 
In general, EPAC assessed VOD more often than the PI in both treatment arms.

Table 21 presents additional analysis on the concordance between EPAC and PI diagnosis of VOD by 
Day +100 post-HSCT, which was based on modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set (n=353). The

HSCT.

aOf the 353 participants in the mITT Analysis Set, 322 had VOD evaluations included in this concordance analysis. 
Thirty-one participants were not included in the analysis due to the following reasons, as specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP; Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/CSR Section 8.8.6/SAP Section 10.1): 18 participants (DP arm 
n=9; BSC arm n=9) died and had EPAC assessment as “No VOD”; 3 participants (DP arm n=2; BSC arm n=1) had 
PI-assessment of VOD as “No VOD” and the EPAC assessment of VOD was prior to the HSCT date; 10 participants 
(all BSC arm) had VOD diagnosis not confirmed by EPAC. Of the 20 participants in the BSC arm not included in this 
analysis, 12 participants were diagnosed as having VOD by the PI, but no confirmed or assessed as “No VOD” by 
EPAC and thus not included in the table. 
Source: Table 14.2.2.1.1 
Per the Study 15-007 protocol, the diagnosis of VOD was based on the Modified Seattle Criteria or liver 
biopsy (if performed; this was not mandatory per study protocol). This applied to both investigator 
diagnosis of VOD and the EPAC assessment for VOD as per the EPAC Charter (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-
007 CSR/Section 8.9.7). A summary description of the diagnosis of VOD per protocol (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/CSR Section 8.1.6/Protocol Section 6.3.1) and the EPAC charter is provided 
below. 
Per study protocol, VOD diagnosis as per the Modified Seattle Criteria required at least 2 of the 
following criteria: 
• 
• 
Total bilirubin >2 mg/dL or 34 μmol 
Hepatomegaly post-HSCT (with or without right upper quadrant pain) or an increase from 
baseline in hepatomegaly. Hepatomegaly (both adults and pediatrics) is defined as a >15% increase in 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 95/194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liver size and an absolute increase of at least 1 cm in length in the mid-clavicular line compared with 
baseline as determined by ultrasonography 
• 
Unexplained weight gain of ≥ 5% above baseline or ascites 
The EPAC were blinded to the study treatment. Given the known challenges in VOD diagnosis, the 
study was set up to provide all relevant clinical information to EPAC to facilitate their assessment of 
VOD in the absence of being in the clinic with the participants. The MAH made all possible efforts to 
provide the relevant clinical, laboratory and imaging information, and guidance to standardize the 
diagnosis of VOD in the study. 
Blinded participant characteristics and relevant clinical information in individual participant profile 
packages were provided to EPAC members, including parameters for Modified Seattle Criteria (bilirubin 
results, weight, and abdominal ultrasound scans from central imaging reports), transplant data, 
adverse event (AE) listings, concomitant medications reports, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) 
reports, laboratory values, and other clinical information available. The diagnosis of VOD by Modified 
Seattle Criteria required the participant to have undergone allogeneic (adults or pediatric participants) 
or autologous (pediatric participants only) HSCT and to have at least 2 of the above-listed Modified 
Seattle Criteria present OR a liver biopsy (if done) that was positive for VOD. 
Each EPAC member was to base their adjudication decision on review of the following as outlined in the 
EPAC Charter: 
• 
• 
• 
ascites 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Weight gain ≥5% from baseline (yes/no, date of assessment) 
Total bilirubin >2 mg/dL (yes/no, date of assessment) 
Imaging reports from the central imaging facility providing data regarding liver size and/or 
Physical exam data (assessment of right upper quadrant pain) 
Additional data as clinically indicated 
Biopsy data (any organ) 
For hyperbilirubinemia/liver dysfunction (such as GvHD, intravascular hemolysis, viral
infection(s), prior liver disease) 
For ascites and/or weight gain (fluid overload, cardiac failure, capillary leak syndrome) 
Challenges in VOD diagnosis are well known and expected, and may be attributed to the following 
(Carreras 2019): 
• 
Lack of a specific test for the diagnosis of the condition, apart from liver biopsy; while 
considered as gold standard, it is not frequently performed in clinical practice due to associated risks in 
such a critically ill population 
• 
• 
Differences in clinical practice and transplant approach between regions and institutions 
Individual physicians’ experience and the importance of applying clinical judgement. 
It appears that the diagnosis assessment of VOD from by the EPAC was made following strict rules in 
applying the Modified Seattle Criteria in their decision; this may not have always been optimal based 
on diagnosis made strictly on data and not being in close monitoring with the patient. It is apparent 
that more participants were diagnosed with VOD than what actually occurred clinically. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 96/194 
 
 
 
 
There are other post-transplant conditions that have similar clinical/laboratory features to VOD 
(Carreras 2019); therefore, clinical judgement and patients’ careful monitoring day to day are of 
paramount importance in the assessment, diagnosis, and management of VOD. 
In addition, as evidenced from the literature, Modified Seattle Criteria is more sensitive but less 
specific for the diagnosis of VOD compared to using Baltimore criteria (14% vs 9%, respectively) 
(Coppell 2010). The latter is a more stringent criteria that is more likely to diagnose severe VOD. 
Furthermore, fluctuations in participants’ level of bilirubin and weight post-HSCT were reported, a 
change that is expected in such a patient population, hence diagnosing VOD strictly on individual 
parameter levels without a trend can be challenging. It appears that some assessments were made by 
EPAC on the day the second Modified Seattle Criteria was met regardless of the limited consistency in 
the changing parameter. 
It is worth noting that VOD free survival at Day +30 post HSCT based on PI diagnosis of VOD was 
numerically higher in the DP arm vs BSC, though not statistically significant as the study was not 
designed to analyze these data as such (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.2.1.13).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Per protocol, diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease VOD was based on modified Seattle Criteria by both 
blinded EPAC and the PI. The blinded EPAC based their assessment of VOD up to Day +100 post-HSCT, 
per the modified Seattle Criteria and on clinical data and information that were provided to them 
electronically for a retrospective analysis. The MAH describes the endeavours made to provide the 
EPAC with all relevant data, including bilirubin results, weight, abdominal ultrasound scans, transplant 
data, adverse event listings, concomitant medications reports, graft-versus-host disease reports, 
laboratory values, and other clinical information available. Despite this, the MAH concludes that the 
EPAC-diagnosed participants with VOD did not have clinically relevant VOD. Since the modified Seattle 
Criteria relies primarily on objective components, this conclusion is not clearly justified. 
The obvious difference between the EPAC and the investigators is that the EPAC was blinded to study 
treatment whereas investigators were not. Given that the discrepancy between EPAC and investigators 
was larger in the defibrotide group (with more study subjects diagnosed with VOD by the EPAC) as 
compared to the best supportive care, these data can also be interpreted that investigators were less 
able or prone to diagnose VOD, especially in the open-label defibrotide group. 
No discussion has been provided regarding any medically relevant differences in characteristics and/or 
severity of VOD that could potentially explain a discordance of VOD assignment between the EPAC and 
investigators. The meaning of ‘being in close monitoring with the patient’ (assumed by the MAH to 
correlate with a better diagnostic ability) has not been discussed in more detail, such as what data 
would be collected by such monitoring that were not captured by the laboratory or clinical data that 
were provided to the EPAC. It is therefore questioned whether such allegedly close monitoring would 
correlate with a more stringent VOD diagnosis. Furthermore, the data on survival for those diagnosed 
Assessment report

with VOD by investigators and those diagnosed with VOD by the EPAC has not been provided, despite 
being requested; see also Q1d above. It is also noted that the approval of defibrotide for treatment of 
severe VOD was based on one open-label pivotal trial with a historical control group; thus, for that 
study, retrospective assessment of VOD was utilised. 
As an additional remark, it is noted that in  
Assessment report

Table 21 above (from table 4 in the response document) there are 96 events of VOD as assessed by 
the EPAC and 43 events of VOD as assessed by investigators (38 + 3 + 2) by Day +100 post-HSCT. 
However, with a reference to listing 16.2.7.3, it is stated that there were 56 participants diagnosed 
with VOD by investigators by Day +100. The MAH should clarify why these 13 participants are not 
included in the description of concordance as outlined in Response Table 4 (LoQ).

Question 4 The MAH should present the data on VOD-resolution in subjects diagnosed with VOD (including 
severity assessment) during study 15-007, divided by those who received defibrotide and those diagnosed vid VOD 
who did not receive defibrotide, for the entire study population and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs 
adults). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH would like to clarify that the resolution of VOD divided by those participants diagnosed with 
VOD and received defibrotide and those who were diagnosed with VOD and did not receive defibrotide 
is not feasible nor a valid analysis from this study. 
Resolution of VOD is provided only for those participants who were diagnosed with VOD by the 
Principal Investigator (PI) and who received rescue treatment. If participants were diagnosed with VOD 
based on Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC) assessment only but who were not diagnosed also 
by the PI, then those participants did not receive rescue treatment. These participants had no 
assessment of VOD resolution performed nor captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF). This 
is further described below: 
Per study protocol, the analysis was based on the retrospective blinded EPAC assessment of VOD; 
however, administration of rescue defibrotide treatment and resolution of VOD was based on PI 
assessment of VOD and reporting. Participants designated as having VOD by EPAC but not by PI would 
not have a resolution recorded, ie would default to not resolved. In addition, per Study 15-007, 
severity of VOD was not defined; therefore, classification of participants with severe VOD was based on 
participants diagnosed with VOD who had associated MOD reported by the investigator (Question 1e). 
Overall, a total of 56 (pediatric n=30, adult n=26) participants were diagnosed as VOD by PI (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.7.3) and received defibrotide rescue treatment. Of the 56, a total 
of 19 participants (pediatric n=9 and adult n=10) were diagnosed with VOD who had a VOD associated 
MOD reported in eCRF and were also diagnosed with VOD by EPAC (100% concordance). These 19 
participants were the total number of participants in the study population (n=372) who had reported 
VOD associated MOD, and as such can be considered as severe VOD (VOD with MOD). All 19 
participants with severe VOD received rescue treatment with defibrotide. The remaining 37 out of the 
56 participants had VOD with no reported associated MOD, hence considered non-severe VOD.

VOD resolution was provided in the final CSR (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.8.3). 
Of the 19 participants with severe VOD, overall 6 (31.6%) had VOD resolution. In pediatrics, resolution 
of severe VOD occurred in 4/10 (40%) participants and in adults with severe VOD resolution occurred 
in 2/9 (22%) participants. In participants with non-severe VOD, resolution occurred in 16/37 (43%). 
In pediatrics, 12/20 (60%) participants reported VOD resolved, and 4/17 (24%) adult participants 
reported VOD resolved. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Given the extensive follow-up of participants up to Day +180 post-HSCT according to the protocol, 
with weekly assessment of VOD and VOD-associated MOD up to day +60 post-HSCT, and at Day +100 
post-HSCT and day +180 post-HSCT, there should be data on VOD resolution for all participants 
diagnosed with VOD during the course of the study. 
As discussed above, this SOB pertains to comparative safety data for defibrotide. If there is no 
difference on resolution of VOD in participants with VOD (regardless if they were diagnosed by 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 100/194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
investigators or EPAC), then this is a matter of lack of efficacy, which is not necessarily a safety 
problem. However, if there was less resolution of VOD among those who received defibrotide for 
rescue treatment as compared to those who did not receive defibrotide for rescue treatment, then this 
is a potential safety problem. The Rapporteur fully agrees that no such evaluation was prespecified in 
the protocol and thus should be interpreted with some caution, however, these data are nevertheless 
of interest for the currently approved indication. Since there was an assessment of VOD mandated 
throughout the study as per the protocol at several time points, these data should have been captured 
and should be presented.

Question 5 One third of the ITT population in study 15-007 had major protocol deviations, primarily related to 
study “procedures/assessments”. The MAH should provide the most frequent reasons for deviation in study 
procedures/assessments and discuss the integrity of the study given the large number of major protocol deviations. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As described in the Study 15-007 clinical study report (CSR), a total of 123 participants (33.1%) had a 
major protocol deviation, with a similar proportion of participants in each treatment arm: 64 (33.7%) 
in the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm and 59 (32.4%) in the best supportive care (BSC) arm (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 4.2). Major deviations were primarily categorized as “study 
procedures/assessments” and were reported for 54 (15.4%) participants overall with a similar 
incidence in each treatment arm: 26 (13.7%) in the DP arm and 28 (15.4%) in the BSC arm. 
None of the major deviations were concluded by the MAH nor the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to 
impact to the data integrity, and no participant was excluded from the analyses due to a major 
protocol deviation. All deviations were reviewed and assessed per the Protocol Deviation Management 
Plan (PDMP) (v2.0, 30 June 2020) 
Listing 16.2.2.5 presents each major deviation for the category “study procedures/assessments” by 
participant with the action/resolution of the deviation. Of the 64 major protocol deviations categorized 
as “study procedures/assessments”, the majority (45/64) were due to missed assessments of vital 
signs — primarily, missed respiratory rate measurements. Other major study procedure/assessment 
deviations were due to missed assessments of weight (9/64), bilirubin (6/64), and ultrasound (4/64). 
Study 15-007 required multiple assessment of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and 
body temperature) as described in the study protocol (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/CSR Section 
8.1.6/Protocol Section 6.8.3). While this is compatible with the close monitoring performed for 
transplant patients in clinical practice, per standard of care, only abnormal results are reported. This 
has led to seemingly numerous missed assessments and hence multiple protocol deviations, which 
based on the conservative prespecified definition of a vital signs major deviation (please see PDMP 
below), comprised approximately 15% of major deviations. 
Although other major deviations were related to missed bilirubin, weight, and ultrasound, the missed 
assessments were intermittent, and therefore, had no impact on VOD assessments in those 
participants. The exception was for 4 participants (2 in each arm) who had major protocol deviations 
due to multiple missed weight measurements and were marked as ‘not evaluable’ by (Endpoint 
Adjudication Committee) EPAC. Both participants in the DP arm had no investigator- assessment of 
VOD, and were therefore, assessed as ‘no VOD’ for analysis: Participant 3903- 1004/64 years/Female 
Assessment report

discontinued study on Day +19 post-HSCT, and Participant 9707-1005/12 years/Female, discontinued 
study on Day +5 post HSCT; these early terminations from study might have contributed to the ‘not 
evaluable’ assessment by the EPAC. Of the 2 participants in the BSC arm, 1 participant (3906-1001/54 
years/Female) was assessed as ‘yes VOD’ by the PI and discontinued on Day 48 from study and 
participant 3304-1005/66 years/Female who was assessed as ‘no VOD’ by the PI and completed the 
study to end. 
Throughout the study, major protocol deviations were reviewed by the sponsor’s medical monitor and 
clinical trial manager and were assessed for impact on participant safety. In addition, DMC members 
reviewed safety data from all participants enrolled at regular intervals throughout the study as per the 
DMC charter Section 6.3 Safety Analyses, which states: “The DMC will review safety for the two 
treatment groups, including AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs (including peri-infusional 
vital signs for patients who receive defibrotide), GvHD, neutrophil and platelet engraftment and graft 
failure, and Karnofsky/Lansky performance scales.” All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
reported for all participants were made available to Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC) members 
for their review of VOD assessment for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
All deviations reported in the study was reviewed and assessed for minor and major protocol 
deviations per the Protocol Deviation Management Plan (PDMP) developed in conjunction with the 
protocol for Study 15-007 (v2.0, 30 June 2020) to outline and define the study-specific requirements 
for the reporting, review, and assessment of minor and major protocol deviations.  
Per this plan, a major protocol deviation was defined as a departure from the approved protocol 
relating to the conduct of the study which may affect the safety and/or wellbeing of study participants 
or the study outcomes or data quality. A prospective list of potential major deviation categories with 
examples of each type was presented in Appendix A of the PDMP. In some cases, continued recurrence 
of minor deviations were classified as a major deviation. Potential major deviations under the category 
of “Study Procedures/Assessments and Visit Scheduling” included: 
Key missed clinical laboratory tests: 
•  Bilirubin 
−  ≥ 30% during Hospitalization (defined as from HSCT to Day 30) 
−  4 or more consecutive timepoints during Hospitalization

−  ≥ 10% during Hospitalization (defined as from HSCT to Day 30) 
−  3 or more consecutive timepoints during Hospitalization

•  Day +30 post-HSCT visit efficacy assessments 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified the most frequent major protocol deviations; for the category ‘study 
procedures/assessments’, this pertains primarily to missed assessments of vital signs, mainly missed 
respiratory rate measurements. This is not part of the VOD diagnosis criteria used in this study. Other 
missed assessments were relatively few. It is stated that only abnormal results were reported; this 
appears not in line with the protocol requirements and would indeed be a very different way of 
collection of data. It is assumed that this is a typo and that also data within normal limits were actually 
collected. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Safety 
Question 6. The MAH should clarify whether subjects treated concomitantly with defibrotide and medications that 
increase the risk of haemorrhage were adequately captured in study 15-007, and provide outcome data in terms of 
VOD, bleeding events and TEAEs for these subjects. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In Study 15-007, participants treated concomitantly with defibrotide and medications that increase the 
risk of haemorrhage were adequately captured. Per the protocol, all medications and therapies taken 
between baseline and Day +60 post-HSCT were recorded as concomitant medications. Per study 
protocol, medications that increase the risk of bleeding were prohibited within 24 hours of the first 
dose of study treatment (defibrotide prophylaxis or as rescue treatment for veno-occlusive disease 
[VOD]) and throughout the duration of defibrotide administration. Patients were permitted to receive 
heparin or other anticoagulants for routine central venous line management, and intermittent dialysis 
or ultrafiltration (Module 5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/Section 8.1.6/ Section 5.7.6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 103/194 
 
 
 
As requested by the Agency, analyses have been conducted specifically for participants who received 
defibrotide concomitantly with any medications that may increase the risk of bleeding (ie, 
anticoagulants) during both the prophylaxis and rescue phases of the study. 
In the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set, 218 patients were identified as having received concomitant 
anticoagulants as defined by a comprehensive list of medications with antithrombotic or fibrinolytic 
effects (Table 23): 97 participants in the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm and 121 participants in the 
best supportive care (BSC) arm. The VOD-free survival rate at Day +30 post-hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) per the independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC), the primary efficacy 
endpoint of Study 15-007, was slightly higher for participants in the DP arm treated concomitantly with 
anticoagulants (69.0%) compared to all participants in the DP arm (N=190; 66.8% [Module 5.3.5.4/ 
Study 15-007 CSR/Table 14.2.1.1]). Therefore, concomitant treatment with anticoagulants did not 
negatively impact VOD-free survival rates in participants treated with defibrotide. Furthermore, the 
VOD- free survival rate by Day +30 post-HSCT for participants in the DP arm who were treated 
concomitantly with defibrotide and anticoagulants (69.0%) was comparable to those in the BSC arm 
treated with anticoagulants (72.6%), as well as all participants in the BSC arm (N=182; 72.5%). The 
incidence of VOD/Death by Day +30 post-HSCT was comparable between participants in the DP arm 
treated concomitantly with anticoagulants (27.8%) and for participants in the BSC arm (24.8%).

Similar results were observed for VOD-free survival rate by Day +100 post-HSCT, where the rate for 
participants in the DP arm treated concomitantly with anticoagulants (62.6%; Table 24) was 
comparable to those participants in the BSC arm treated with anticoagulants (60.6%). The incidence of 
VOD/Death by Day +100 post-HSCT was comparable between participants in the DP arm treated

Table 24. VOD-free Survival by Day +100 post-HSCT for Participants Treated Concomitantly 
with Medications that Increase the Risk of Hemorrhage (ITT Analysis Set) 
A total of 95 participants (which represents approximately 50% of the DP arm population) in the 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS) were identified who received a concomitant anticoagulant in the defibrotide 
prophylaxis (DP) arm during the prophylaxis phase (Table 14.2.8.3). During the prophylaxis phase, the 
types of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported and their frequencies were similar 
between participants treated concomitantly with anticoagulants and the entire DP arm of the SAS. Of 
the most commonly reported TEAEs, by Preferred Term (PT) in participants treated concomitantly with 
anticoagulants during the prophylaxis phase (incidence ≥ 15% [ 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 105/194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 25]), no individual PT was reported with a ≥ 5% incidence relative to the entire DP arm of the 
SAS. Since the number of participants who were treated concomitantly with anticoagulants was 
approximately equal to the number of patients who never received anticoagulants in the DP arm, none 
of these TEAEs would have occurred with a greater than 10% frequency difference between these 2 
sub-groups. Participants treated concomitantly with anticoagulants did not contribute disproportionally 
to the incidence of the most commonly reported TEAEs. Overall, the safety profile of participants 
treated concomitantly with anticoagulants was consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide.

The small sample sizes in the rescue phase of Study 15-007 limits any conclusions on the available 
safety data. A total of 25 and 31 participants received defibrotide as rescue treatment in the DP and 
BSC arms, respectively. Of these, 17 of 25 participants (68%) in the DP arm and 25 of 31 participants 
(80.6%) in the BSC arm were treated concomitantly with anticoagulants (Table 14.2.8.3). Since the 
majority of participants received treatment with concomitant anticoagulants during the rescue phase, 
the safety profile of the overall population, in the rescue phase, is largely based on the safety profile of 
these participants who received concomitant anticoagulant with defibrotide. 
In participants treated concomitantly with defibrotide and anticoagulants, the most commonly reported 
bleeding terms (PTs) during the prophylaxis phase of the study were Epistaxis, Haematuria, 
Haematochezia, and Mouth haemorrhage (Table 14.2.8.3). The incidences of these PTs were 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 107/194 
 
 
 
comparable with those reported in the entire DP arm of the SAS (N=181): Epistaxis (21.1% vs 21.5%, 
respectively), Haematuria 8.4% vs 9.9%, respectively), Haematochezia (4.2% vs 2.8%, respectively), 
and Mouth haemorrhage (4.2% vs 2.8%, respectively) (Module 5.3.5.4/ Study 15-007 CSR/Table 
14.3.1.2). Since the number of participants who were treated concomitantly with anticoagulants was 
approximately equal to the number of patients who never received anticoagulants in the DP arm, none 
of these TEAEs would have occurred with a greater than 3% frequency difference between these 2 
sub-groups. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified that in Study 15-007, participants treated concomitantly with defibrotide and 
medications that increase the risk of haemorrhage were adequately captured (this is assumed to be 
despite previous statement that concomitant medications were not captured consistently in the clinical 
database). Systemic anticoagulation was not allowed in patients treated with defibrotide; per study 
protocol, medications that increase the risk of bleeding were prohibited within 24 hours of the first 
dose of study treatment (defibrotide prophylaxis or as rescue treatment for VOD) and throughout the 
duration of defibrotide administration. Patients were permitted to receive heparin or other 
anticoagulants for routine central venous line management, and intermittent dialysis or ultrafiltration. 
Please note that all medications that may increase the risk of bleeding are not anticoagulants. The 
large number of subjects that are stated to have been treated with anticoagulants in study 15-007 
could thus have been treated with any medication having antithrombotic or fibrinolytic properties. The 
actual types of such medications have not been discussed, therefore, whether subjects were treated 
with anticoagulants or not cannot be assessed. Further, it cannot be assessed whether any subjects 
were treated with systemic anticoagulation or only in relation to CVC 
management/dialysis/ultrafiltration; the risk of e g bleeding is likely different depending on these 
different scenarios.  
In line with the overall study population, among subjects concomitantly treated with medications that 
increase the risk of haemorrhage, there was a higher proportion of subjects in the defibrotide group 
who had VOD/death by Day +30 post-HSCT (27/97 or 27.8%) as compared to the best supportive 
care (30/121 or 24.8%). The proportion and type of reported TEAEs are comparable between those 
receiving defibrotide in addition to “anticoagulation” (assumed to be any medication that could 
increase the risk of bleeding) and the entire defibrotide group. 
The current label contraindicates use of thrombolytic therapy concomitantly with defibrotide, whereas 
use of medicinal products that increase the risk of haemorrhage within 24 hours of Defitelio 
administration (within 12 hours in the case of unfractionated heparin) is not recommended. For 
concomitant systemic anticoagulant therapy, careful monitoring is required with consideration to 
discontinue Defitelio during use of such therapy. Medicinal products that affect platelet aggregation 
(e.g., NSAIDs) should be administered with care, under close medical supervision, during Defitelio 
administration. It cannot be assessed whether medications that could increase the risk of bleeding 
were used in accordance with the label for Defitelio in study 15-007 as no details on the type and 
administration route of such medications have been provided.

Question 7. A summary of the TEAEs and the treatment-related TEAEs in study 15-007 should be provided, 
separated by children and adults using the number of children and adults respectively as the denominator when 
presenting percentages. Any differences between treatment groups as well as any differences between age groups 
should be addressed, including any implications for the labelling of adverse reactions. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by treatment arm and age subgroup 
(pediatrics, ≤ 16 years of age; adults, > 16 years of age) have been prepared using the number of 
participants in each subgroup, respectively, as the denominator to calculate incidences. The results 
from Study 15-007 demonstrate that the safety of defibrotide is comparable between adults and 
pediatric subgroups. While some TEAEs were observed as more common in one age subgroup versus 
the other, there were no trends observed, and results were comparable between the 2 treatment arms 
of the study. The safety results from Study 15-007 are consistent with the known defibrotide safety 
profile; accordingly, no changes will be required to the current Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) and the Reference safety information (RSI). 
A total of 187 pediatric participants (defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm, n = 99; best supportive care 
(BSC) arm n = 88) and 168 adult participants (DP arm, n = 82; BSC arm n = 86) were included in the 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS). Demographic and baseline characteristics for these subgroups are 
summarized in Module 5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/Section 9.1/Table 14.1.4.4 (pediatric) and Table 
14.1.4.6 (adults). Treatment-emergent AEs were summarized by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) and by treatment arm and age subgroup (pediatrics, ≤ 16 years of age; adults, > 
16 years of age) in Module 5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/Section 9.3/Table 14.3.1.4. However, the 
denominator used for the subgroups in this previously-submitted summary table was the number of 
participants in the overall population, rather than the number of participants in each subgroup. Table 
14.3.1.27 and Table 14.3.1.28, provided at the request of the Agency, summarize the TEAEs and 
treatment-related TEAEs, respectively, in Study 15-007 by treatment arm and by age subgroups using 
the number of participants in the respective subgroup as denominator. The most common TEAEs 
(those occurring in ≥ 20% of participants (by SOC or PT) overall and in any subgroup in either 
treatment arm) are shown for the prophylaxis and rescue phases in Table 26. 
Prophylaxis Phase 
Nearly all participants, regardless of age group, had at least 1 TEAE during the prophylaxis phase. The 
most common TEAE PTs for the pediatric population were similar for the 2 treatment arms during the 
prophylaxis phase and included Pyrexia, Vomiting, Stomatitis, Nausea, and Diarrhoea. The most 
common TEAE PTs for the adult population was similar to the pediatric population and similar for the 2 
treatment arms during the prophylaxis phase. 
In the prophylaxis phase, higher incidences (> 10%) of TEAEs for the pediatric subgroup compared to 
the adult subgroup were observed for several PTs, eg: Hypomagnesaemia, Platelet Count Decreased, 
Activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, Febrile Neutropenia, Pyrexia, Pain, Tachypnoea, and 
Sinus Tachycardia (Table 14.3.1.27). However, the incidences of these PTs were comparable between 
the DP and BSC treatment arms within the pediatric subgroup. 
In the prophylaxis phase, higher incidences of TEAEs by PT for the adult subgroup compared to the 
pediatric subgroup were observed including Headache, Back pain, Haemorrhoids, Anxiety, and 
Insomnia. Similarly, the incidences were comparable between the DP and BSC arms within the adult 
subgroup. 
As expected in this open-label study where the comparator arm consists of supportive care, 
assessments of treatment relatedness were made only in the DP arm during the prophylaxis phase

(Table 14.3.1.28). During the prophylaxis phase, more adult participants compared to pediatric 
participants experienced a TEAE assessed as related to defibrotide treatment (pediatric 16 [16.2%]; 
adult 25 [30.5%]). Treatment-related TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 2% of participants in either age 
subgroup of the DP arm included Epistaxis (pediatric 4 [4.0%]; adult 4 [4.9%]), Haematochezia 
(pediatric 3 [3.0%]; adult 1 [1.2%]), Activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (pediatric 2 
[2.0%]; adult 2 [2.4%]), Haematemesis (pediatric 2 [2.0%]; adult 1 [1.2%]), and Gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage (pediatric 1 [1.0%]; adult 2 [2.4%]). 
Rescue Phase 
A total of 30 pediatric participants (DP arm, n = 15; BSC arm n = 15) and 26 adult participants (DP 
arm, n = 10; BSC arm n = 16) were included in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS) of the rescue phase. All 
participants, regardless of age group, had at least 1 TEAE during the rescue phase (Table 26). The 
most common TEAE Preferred Terms (PTs) for the pediatric population during the rescue phase 
included Veno-occlusive disease, Constipation, Vomiting, Hypertension. Worthy of note, for pediatric 
participants, the incidences of Pyrexia (DP arm [13.3%], BSC arm [53.3%]) and Hypotension (DP arm 
[0], BSC arm [33.3%]) were greater in the BSC arm vs DP arm. During the rescue phase, both 
treatment arms received defibrotide; therefore, assessment of relatedness to defibrotide treatment 
could be made for either arm (Table 14.3.1.28). Only Epistaxis occurred in more than 1 participant 
within a treatment group (n = 2, BSC arm) — 1 pediatric participant and 1 adult participant. All other 
PTs were reported for 1 participant each per treatment group and age subgroup. 
AESIs (pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypersensitivity reactions) were 
summarized by age subgroup and presented in M2.7.4 Addendum 1/Section 5.1. During the 
prophylaxis phase, the incidence of AESI of gastrointestinal bleeding was less than 10% overall. 
Although, there was a higher incidence of these events in the pediatric subgroup compared with the 
adult subgroup, the number of events were comparable between the 2 treatment arms in both 
subgroups (DP arm: n = 10 pediatric [5.5%], n = 6 adult [3.3%]; and BSC arm: n = 10 pediatric 
[5.7%], n = 4 adult [2.3%]). A similar observation was made during the rescue phase. The higher 
incidence of bleeding events in the pediatric subgroup is consistent with the current defibrotide SmPC. 
However, the observation from Study 15-007 with the BSC reference therapy arm indicates that this 
observation may not be a reflection of defibrotide treatment, but rather, the pediatric subgroup is 
inherently at a higher risk for some bleeding events. 
In conclusion, the above results from study 15-007 demonstrates that the safety of defibrotide is 
comparable between adults and pediatric subgroups. While some AEs were observed as more common 
in one age subgroup versus the other, there were no trends observed and results were comparable 
between the 2 treatment arms of the study. 
The safety results from Study 15-007 are consistent with the known defibrotide safety profile; 
accordingly, no changes will be required to the current SmPC and the RSI.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The requested data on TEAEs in the paediatric and adult subgroups have been provided. The MAH 
states that the safety results from Study 15-007 are consistent with the known defibrotide safety 
profile and that no changes will be required to the current SmPC. In the provided tables 14.3.1.27 and 
14.3.1.28, there is no grouping of events describing similar entities which hampers assessment; 
however, based on the summary of TEAEs occurring in at least 20% of participants during the 
prophylaxis phase, there are no clear differences between age groups that warrant further 
investigations. 
During the rescue phase however, although it is stated that the proportion of participants who 
experienced at least one AESI of pulmonary haemorrhage during the rescue phase was similar in the 
paediatric subgroup and adult subgroup, this is contradicted by the actual data. Again, all subjects 
received defibrotide for rescue treatment; arm assignment pertains to the randomised arm for the 
prophylaxis phase only. In the paediatric group, there were 8 events of pulmonary haemorrhage 
(original DP arm [n = 3; 12.0%], BSC arm [n = 5;16.1%]) whereas in adults, there were 2 events of 
pulmonary haemorrhage (original DP arm [n = 1; 4.0%], BSC arm [n = 1; 3.2%]). It appears however 
that ‘pulmonary haemorrhage’ included epistaxis, which was the actual event behind the majority of 
events termed ‘pulmonary haemorrhage’.

Issue resolved.

Question 8. The MAH is asked to clarify why only 10 of the deaths that occurred in each treatment arm during 
the “prophylaxis phase” of study 15-007 were included in the presentation of TEAE leading to death up to day +180 
post-HSCT; even when adding those who were diagnosed with VOD and died due to adverse events, the figures are 
not congruent with the overall presentation of death during the study. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
For Study 15-007, the seeming discordances in the number of deaths reported as a treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) and the total number of deaths in the study are due to the following 
reasons: 
Per Study 15-007 protocol, the collection of TEAEs were defined within a pre-specified period 
(described below). All deaths and cause of death were captured on the Death electronic case report 
form (eCRF). Causes of death were not always due to adverse events (AEs). If the fatal event occurred 
outside the AE reporting period, no fatal AE was captured on the AE eCRF, as it would not be 
considered as treatment emergent per the protocol. In summary, all deaths were reported; a subset of 
deaths were also reported as AEs with fatal outcome if the onset date was within the prespecified 
reporting period. 
A total of 65 (defibrotide prophylaxis arm [DP] n=35, best supportive care [BSC] arm n=30) deaths 
were reported for the entire study population to Day +180 post-HSCT. Of these 65, a total of 46 
deaths (DP arm n=23, BSC arm n=23) were due to AEs. Of the 46 deaths with AE as cause of death 
40 participants had at least 1 TEAEs with a fatal outcome, and the remaining 6 participants (DP arm 
n=1, BSC arm n=5) died due to an AE with an onset date outside AE reporting period. 
Over the duration of the study, 40 participants had at least 1 TEAE with a fatal outcome: 
• 
• 
Prophylaxis phase: 20 participants (DP n=10 [5.5%]; BSC n=10 [5.7%]). 
Rescue Phase: 20 participants (DP n=12 [12/25; 48.0%]; BSC n=8 [8/31; 25.8%] 
In short, deaths associated TEAEs occurred for a similar number of participants between the 
prophylaxis phase and rescue phase, as well as, between the DP and BSC arms. A detailed summary of 
the number of adverse events leading to death is described below. 
Per the protocol, at a minimum, the investigator recorded all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
that occur from the time written informed consent was obtained until screen failure if applicable, or 
Day +60 post- hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), regardless of their relationship to study 
drug or procedure (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 8.1.6/Protocol Section 6.8.1.5). Even if the 
minimum of Day +60 post-HSCT was met, the investigator continued to record all AEs and SAEs that 
occur within 30 days after the last dose of defibrotide, regardless of their relationship to study drug or 
procedure. Any SAE assessed as related to defibrotide or study procedures by the investigator was 
reported regardless of time after study termination. 
In Study 15-007, the occurrence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and the administration of rescue 
defibrotide represent a clinical landmark time point for safety. As described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP; Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 8.8.6), the safety analyses was conducted using 2 
study phases, which were defined with respect to the administration of rescue defibrotide, as follows: 
Prophylaxis Phase: 
If VOD occurred, the prophylaxis phase started on the Baseline date and ends on the day before the 
start date of rescue defibrotide (ie, rescue treatment start date – 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 114/194 
 
 
 
If VOD does not occur, the prophylaxis phase starts on the Baseline date and ends on the date of study 
completion/early termination. 
Rescue Treatment Phase: 
For the subset of participants who developed VOD and received rescue defibrotide, the rescue 
treatment phase began on the start date of rescue defibrotide and ended on the date of study 
completion/early termination. 
Twenty participants in the prophylaxis phase had at least 1 TEAE reported on the AE electronic case 
report form (eCRF) with a fatal outcome: 10 participants (5.5%) in the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) 
arm and 10 participants (5.7%) in the best supportive care (BSC) arm (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Table 14.3.1.14). In addition, 20 participants in the rescue phase had at least 1 TEAEs with a fatal 
outcome: 12 participants (12/25; 48.0%) in the DP arm and 8 participants (8/31; 25.8%) in the BSC 
arm. Therefore, overall, 40 participants had at least 1 TEAE that lead to death. The small number of 
participants in each treatment arm during the rescue phase limits the interpretation of these safety 
data, as just 1 reported event can dramatically affect the percentage. With the exception of VOD and 
multiorgan dysfunction (MOD), no specific TEAE PT with a fatal outcome was reported in more than 1 
participant during the rescue phase; as such, no trend or association with defibrotide treatment was 
observed. 
All deaths were captured on the Death eCRF, regardless of whether they were captured as a fatal TEAE 
on the AE eCRF. The cause of death was captured on the Death eCRF; however, if the cause of death 
was an AE, this was captured as a non-specific event (ie, “adverse event”) with no additional field to 
capture an event term. In addition to the safety analysis of TEAEs leading to death described above, 
based on the AE eCRF, the MAH prepared an ad hoc summary of all deaths (any cause) by Day +30, 
Day +100, and Day +180 post-HSCT by treatment arm, which is based upon the Death eCRF (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.2.5). Through Day +180 post-HSCT, a total of 65 participants died. 
The proportion of participants who died during the study was similar in the 2 treatment arms (DP arm 
n=35 [32.1%]; BSC arm, n=30 [29.4%]). Of the 65, a total of 46 participants died due to an AE 
(unspecified) per the ad hoc analysis (23 participants in each treatment arm). 
The seeming discrepancy between the number of participants (n=40 for both treatment arms and both 
study phases) with a TEAE leading to death, per the safety analysis, and the number of participants 
with a primary cause of death as AE (n=46), per the ad hoc analysis, is due to the fact that some 
participants within the study died outside of the protocol-defined AE reporting period as described 
above, and therefore, the death and cause of death were captured on the Death eCRF, with no fatal AE 
reported on the AE eCRF. 
Despite this discrepancy, individual participant narratives describing all deaths were prepared and 
provided in Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 11. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified that deaths due to AEs were only captured as AEs with fatal outcome if they 
occurred during the specific AE reporting period, which could thus be different as compared to the 
overall number of participants with a primary cause of death as AE. The specific AE reporting period 
was up to Day +60 post-HSCT or up to 30 days after last defibrotide dose; SAEs assessed as related to 
defibrotide or study procedures by the investigator were however to be reported regardless of time 
after study termination. 
The definition of prophylaxis phase is somewhat different in this response as compared to the 
definition of the CSR as included in section 8 Safety above, where it was stated that for the overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 115/194 
 
 
 
safety population, this phase was defined as the period between baseline and start date of rescue 
defibrotide, if applicable, or the period between baseline and Day +180 post-HSCT if no VOD occurred 
(assumably based on VOD diagnosed by investigators). During the prophylaxis phase, 10 participants 
in each treatment arm had a TEAE with a fatal outcome. During the rescue phase, however, there is a 
clear imbalance between treatment arms. All subjects in the rescue phase received defibrotide, 
therefore, the impact of the initial randomised groups is less clear, however, it is noted that TEAEs 
with a fatal outcome occurred in 12 participants (12/25; 48.0%) in the defibrotide arm and 8 
participants (8/31; 25.8%) in the best supportive care arm. There is no in-depth discussion on this 
finding by the MAH, only a statement that the number of participants in each treatment arm is small 
which limits the interpretation of these data, and that no specific TEAE PT with a fatal outcome was 
reported in more than 1 participant during the rescue phase with the exception of VOD and MOD (the 
number of which is however not presented). There could be several possible reasons for this finding; 
one could be that participants in the best supportive care arm had less severe VOD (since severity, 
especially whether MOF/MOD is present at diagnosis or not, is known to affect the outcome), however, 
another reason could be that participants who had already been exposed to defibrotide had a worse 
prognosis related to the previous defibrotide treatment as such. The MAH should discuss this finding in 
more detail including any need to include a recommendation to avoid repeated use of defibrotide in the 
label. Further, as previously requested, the immunogenicity data should be provided. (LoQ) 
Conclusion 
Issue partly resolved; further discussion on the clear imbalance between the randomised groups 
regarding TEAEs with a fatal outcome during the rescue phase is warranted. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 9 For all three adverse events of special interest (pulmonary, haemorrhage, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, hypersensitivity) which are also labelled adverse reactions for Defitelio, the reported event rates 
during rescue treatment appear higher than what would be expected based on the current label. The MAH should 
discuss these data in relation to the labelled frequencies and propose any label updates if warranted. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The incidence of related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within the adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) categories of pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and 
hypersensitivity occurred at the same or lower frequency categories during both the prophylaxis and 
rescue phases of Study 15-007 when compared to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) presented in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). As such, no updates to the ADRs listed in the SmPC or 
their respective frequencies would be supported by the new data. 
When performing a frequency analysis of TEAEs between Study 15-007 and safety data presented in 
the SmPC, the MAH would like to emphasize the process by which section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of 
the SmPC was created. The original tabulated list of adverse reactions in the SmPC included any 
Preferred Term (PT) assessed as treatment related in at least 2 subjects within a pooled analysis of 
safety (SAF3 pool, N=419) that included several clinical studies. The frequency categories of each ADR 
subsequently were determined from the incidence of treatment-related occurrences as well. On a 
limited basis, which affected approximately a dozen ADRs in the SmPC, synonymous PTs were grouped 
together and included as single PTs. The frequencies of some ADRs in the SmPC were subsequently 
updated and increased after comparison with data from the completed T-IND (2006-05) Study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 116/194 
 
 
 
 
For the AESI of Pulmonary hemorrhage, the current SmPC only includes Pulmonary haemorrhage as an 
ADR. In creating the SmPC, the term of Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage was grouped under 
Pulmonary haemorrhage, and the frequency was determined as common. The Statistical Analysis Plan 
for Study 15-007 included a broad range of PTs to use in the analysis for Pulmonary hemorrhage. 
Bleeding terms of the upper respiratory tract such as Epistaxis were also included in the overall 
summary table. When excluding Epistaxis, the incidences of bleeding within the lower respiratory tract 
and the lungs themselves were very low. During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, the incidence 
of Pulmonary haemorrhage and Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage TEAEs deemed related to defibrotide 
treatment were both < 1%, or uncommon, in frequency (Table 27). As expected in this open-label 
study where the comparator arm consists of supportive care, assessments of treatment relatedness 
were made only in the DP arm during the prophylaxis phase. The incidence of Pulmonary haemorrhage 
and Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage events, regardless of causality, were very low and comparable in 
the DP and BSC arms. The incidence of these events were also lower in Study 15-007 compared to the 
SAF3 pool (Table 28). Within the system organ class (SOC) of Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders, Epistaxis is also listed as a bleeding ADR in the SmPC. This PT occurred with comparable 
incidence (both common in frequency in Study 15-007 [4.4%] and the SAF3 pool [4%] as a treatment-
related TEAE). Epistaxis, regardless of causality, was reported at a higher incidence in Study 15-007 
compared to the SAF3 pool (21.5% vs 8%, respectively). However, the incidence of Epistaxis was 
actually lower in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm (21.5%) than the best supportive care arm (25.9%) 
within Study 15-007 (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15- 007 CSR/Table 14.3.1.3), suggesting the incidence is 
driven by the underlying disease of the study population and the conditioning regimen rather than 
exposure to defibrotide. During the rescue phase of Study 15-007, the incidences of hemorrhage 
events within the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC were lower than in the 
prophylaxis phase for both study arms.

For the AESI of Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the current SmPC includes several bleeding ADRs under 
the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC. This includes the PTs of Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
Haematemesis, and Mouth haemorrhage, which are listed as common in frequency, and the PT of 
Melaena that has a frequency of uncommon. Additionally, in creating the SmPC the terms of Gastric 
haemorrhage, Haematochezia, and Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage were grouped together under 
the PT of Gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The incidences of both treatment-related and all causality 
bleeding PTs were generally comparable within the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders between the 
prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007 and the SAF3 pool (

Table 29 and

of treatment-related TEAEs in Study 15-007. During the rescue phase of Study 15- 007, the incidence 
of hemorrhage events within the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were generally comparable or lower 
than in the prophylaxis phase for both study arms.

For the AESI of Hypersensitivity, the current SmPC includes the PTs of Hypersensitivity and 
Anaphylactic reaction as ADRs, which are assigned uncommon frequency classifications. In the SAF3 
pool, no treatment-related events of these PTs were actually reported. These PTs were added to the 
SmPC due to cases of hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis being reported from a previously 
marketed formulation of defibrotide. In addition, the SmPC includes non-specific terms that may 
represent hypersensitivity reactions, including the PTs of Rash and Pruritis (both classified as common 
in frequency). In creating the SmPC, the term of Pruritis generalized was grouped under the PT of 
Pruritis, and the term of Purpura was grouped under the PT of Rash. 
The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs were very low (Table 31) during the prophylaxis phase of 
Study 15-007 and would not change the frequency categorizations of the any of these identified ADRs 
in the SmPC. The incidences of hypersensitivity reactions and rash, regardless of causality, were higher 
in Study 15-007 compared to the SAF3 pool (

Table 32). However, the incidences of these events was again comparable between the defibrotide 
prophylaxis and best supportive care arms within Study 15-007. During the rescue phase of Study 15-
007, the incidences of hypersensitivity and rash/pruritis events were lower than in the prophylaxis 
phase for both study arms.

5.3.5.3/Integrated Summary of Safety/Table 109: All Adverse Events and Occurrence Rates, SAF3 pool column 
A frequency analysis of treatment-related TEAEs from the AESIs in Study 15-007 compared to the 
SmPC shows no changes to the frequency categorizations of specific ADRs identified in the label. As 
such no updates to the list of adverse reactions or their frequencies are required based on the data 
and results from Study 15-007. When comparing all TEAEs regardless of causality some individual PTs 
(such as Epistaxis, Drug hypersensitivity, and Rash) did occur with a higher incidence in Study 15-007 
than in the SAF3 pool. However, the incidences of these events were comparable between the 
defibrotide prophylaxis and the best supportive care arms within Study 15-007. The comparable 
results between the study arms suggests transplant related toxicities, within the proximity of 
transplant, as the likely contributing factors for the increased incidence in the prophylaxis phase. It is 
well established that many agents used in conditioning regimens in preparation of the transplant, 
including myeloablative conditioning, have strong association with hypersensitivity reactions and rash. 
This differs from prior clinical studies evaluating the treatment of severe VOD where defibrotide is 
typically initiated at least several weeks after transplant. 
Overall, the safety results from Study 15-007 are consistent with the known safety profile of 
defibrotide. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has clarified that the incidence of related TEAEs within the AESI categories of pulmonary 
haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and hypersensitivity occurred at the same or lower 
frequency categories during both the prophylaxis and rescue phases of Study 15-007 when compared 
to ADRs presented in the SmPC, and that no updates to the ADRs listed in the SmPC or their 
respective frequencies are warranted. Previous prophylaxis studies are included in the SAF3 pool used 
for SmPC ADR determination; thus, also the prophylaxis data from study 15-007 would be expected to 
be included. However, the MAH states that all frequency classifications within the SmPC would remain 
unchanged using the incidence of treatment-related TEAEs in Study 15-007.

Question 10. Immunogenicity was an exploratory endpoint for which no data have been provided. However, this 
is one of the safety concerns addressed by this study. Considering also the difference in hypersensitivity reactions 
between prophylaxis treatment arms in subjects who developed VOD and were treated with defibrotide, the MAH 
should provide the immunogenicity data. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Sponsor is committed to providing the immunogenicity report associated with this study. It is a 
post-marketing commitment of the US New Drug Application for Defitelio and will be available for 
submission in Q1 2022. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
A commitment to provide these data later is not acceptable. Immunogenicity is one of the safety 
concerns addressed by this Category 2 study. The requested data should be provided with the 
Response to the LoQ. 
Conclusion 
Issue not resolved. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 11. A summary of all vital sign variables recorded should be presented for the respective treatment 
group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 
post-VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period. These data should be provided for the overall study population 
(safety analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) included all participants randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) 
arm who received at least 1 dose of defibrotide (n = 181) and all participants randomized to the best 
supportive care (BSC) arm who received at least 1 dose of study drug (n = 174) (Module 
5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/Figure 2). Of these, 25 participants in the DP arm and 31 participants in the 
BSC arm developed VOD, based on investigator assessment, and received defibrotide as rescue 
treatment. 
Table 14.3.3.4.1 provides a summary of vital signs by treatment arm for baseline and Day +30 post- 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with changes from baseline to Day +30 post- HSCT. Table 
14.3.3.4.2 provides a summary of vital signs by treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of veno-
occlusive disease (VOD) and Day +30 post-VOD treatment with changes from VOD diagnosis to Day 
+30 post-VOD rescue treatment. Both analyses were performed for the overall SAS and by age 
subgroups (pediatric participants [≤ 16 years old] and adult participants [> 16 years]). 
Overall, no clinically meaningful differences in the mean and median weight, temperature, pulse, blood 
pressure, and respiratory rate were observed between the DP and BSC treatment arms at the 
timepoints specified. Mean changes in vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT were similar 
between the treatment arms for the overall SAS, as well as both age subgroups. Although some 
substantial changes in vital signs from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment are 
observed between the 2 treatment arms, the results should be interpreted with caution as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 124/194 
 
 
 
 
numbers of participants included the rescue phase were small, and those with vital signs captured at 
both time points were even smaller. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
For vital signs at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT, changes from baseline were overall small and 
without clear differences between treatment groups. 
However, for the vital signs at VOD diagnosis and 30 days after VOD diagnosis, no assessment can be 
made due to lack of data. Of the 25 subjects in the randomized defibrotide group who were diagnosed 
with VOD by investigators, only 6 have blood pressure measurements at the day of VOD diagnosis. For 
the best supportive care group, 31 subjects were diagnosed with VOD by investigators and 27 have 
blood pressure measurements at the day of VOD diagnosis. After day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment 
(n b not post-HSCT), blood pressure measurements were available for 12 subjects in the defibrotide 
group and 20 subjects in the best supportive care group; there was a mean/median decrease of 
systolic blood pressure in the defibrotide group of 19/13 mmHg whereas mean/median systolic blood 
pressure was stable in the best supportive care group; however, there were only 3 subjects for whom 
blood pressure was available at both day of VOD diagnosis in the defibrotide group (17 in the best 
supportive care group). For diastolic blood pressure, the overall picture is similar but again, only 3 
subjects are available for assessment in the defibrotide group. Also, for pulse rate, respiratory rate, 
temperature, and weight, there is data for only 6 subjects in the defibrotide group on the day of 
investigators’ VOD diagnosis (as compared to data for 27 subjects in the best supportive care group for 
pulse rate and temperature, 22 for respiratory rate and 23 for weight) and for only 3 subjects, there 
are vital sign data both on date of VOD diagnosis and after 30 days in the defibrotide group. 
Although it cannot by the protocol be expected to have vital signs data at exactly day +30 after 
initiation of VOD rescue therapy in all participants, it would be expected to have these data at the day 
of VOD diagnosis. The paucity of data at the day of VOD diagnosis further entails that a proper 
assessment of concomitant multiorgan failure/dysfunction cannot be made. 
Conclusion 
Issue not pursued. 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 12. During the rescue phase, 4 participants (16.0%) in the DP arm and 3 participants (9.7%) in the 
BSC arm experienced graft failure. The MAH is asked to discuss these findings on graft failure during the rescue 
phase in more detail, including any possible relation to defibrotide. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
At the final analysis of study 15-007, a total of 8 participants in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm (DP; 4 
during each of the prophylaxis and rescue phases of the study) and 6 participants in the Best 
Supportive Care arm (BSC; 3 in each study phase) were reported to have experienced engraftment 
failure (Module 5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/Table 14.3.5.3). However, investigating the data on 
engraftment listing (Listing 16.2.14.2), an additional 3 participants — all in the BSC arm (Participant 
IDs: 1102-1003, 4904-1001 and 6102-1010) — were reported to have experienced engraftment 
failure (Prophylaxis phase=1, Rescue phase=2); yet they were not captured in the analysis of graft 
failure (Table 14.3.5.3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 125/194 
 
 
 
 
Per the statistical analysis Plan (SAP) engraftment failure was analyzed based on participants who 
reported to have both neutrophil and platelet engraftment prior to engraftment failure. As such, 
although these 3 participants had both neutrophil and platelet engraftment (Module 5.3.5.4/Study 15-
007 CSR/Listing 16.2.14.1 and Listing 16.2.14.2), only 1 engraftment occurred prior to the reported 
date of graft failure hence they were excluded in the final study analysis Table 14.3.5.3. Including the 
3 participants described above who were initially excluded from the graft failure analysis based on the 
SAP definition, a total of 17 participants were had engraftment failure. 
Table 33 presents a listing of all participants (n=17) who experienced engraftment failure by treatment 
arm and study phase (Listing 16.2.14.2). Disease characteristics and relevant clinical information with 
respect to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) engraftment are provided. 
From Table 33, in the prophylaxis phase, 4 (2.2%) participants in the DP arm and 5 (2.7%) 
participants in the BSC arm (including 2 participants in the BSC arm who were excluded from the graft 
failure in Table 14.3.5.3) arm had engraftment failure. 
In the rescue phase, including the 1 additional participant in BSC who experienced graft failure but was 
not captured in the original analysis, 4 (16.0%) participants in the DP arm and 4 (12.9%) participants 
in the BSC arm had engraftment failure. 
Per the investigator assessment of reported adverse events, no graft failure was related to defibrotide 
treatment. 
In summary, the proportion of participants who experienced graft failure are comparable between the 
DP arm and the BSC arm in both the prophylactic (4/181 [2.2%] and 5/174 [2.9%], respectively) and 
rescue phases (4/25 [16%] and 4/31 [12.9%], respectively) of the study. There does not appear to be 
any relationship between graft failure and defibrotide treatment; rather, the graft failures experienced 
by participants in Study 15-007 are attributed to the underlying factors that are inherent in the 
participants and/or related to the type of transplant and known to increase the likelihood of graft 
failure (eg, allogenic transplant, HLA mismatch).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It appears that only secondary graft failure was analysed in study 15-007, since per the SAP, 
engraftment failure was analysed based on participants who reported to have both neutrophil and 
platelet engraftment prior to engraftment failure. 
There was a similar proportion of graft failure in the prophylaxis phase, with 4/181 (2.2%) participants 
in the defibrotide group and 5/174 (2.7%) participants in the best supportive care group experiencing 
graft failure. During the rescue phase, however, when all participants received defibrotide, the 
proportions of graft failures was higher: 8/56 (14%), with more participants in the original defibrotide 
prophylaxis group as compared to the previous best supportive care group. The conditioning regimen 
used (majority MAC) could imply a lower risk of graft failure, however, based on the degree of match, 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 128/194 
 
 
 
 
there appears to be more participants with secondary graft failure during the rescue phase who had a 
lower degree of match which could increase the risk of graft failure and potentially explain the higher 
proportion of graft failures among these participants. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 13 For abdominal ultrasound results, no summary of data has been provided; the MAH is asked to 
provide a summary of the findings in each treatment group, for the overall study population (safety analysis set) 
and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As per the Study 15-007 protocol (Module 5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/CSR 
Section 8.1.6/Protocol Section 6.3.1.1), VOD diagnosis as per the Modified Seattle Criteria required at 
least 2 of the following criteria: 
• 
• 
Total bilirubin >2 mg/dL or 34 μmol 
Hepatomegaly post-HSCT (with or without right upper quadrant pain) or an increase from 
baseline in hepatomegaly. Hepatomegaly (both adults and paediatrics) is defined as a >15% increase 
in liver size and an absolute increase of at least 1 cm in length in the mid-clavicular line compared with 
baseline as determined by ultrasonography 
• 
Unexplained weight gain of ≥5% above baseline or ascites (Ascites is defined as the presence 
of any amount of free fluid greater than trace fluid in the abdomen as determined by ultrasonography 
in a patient with “ascites absent” at baseline.) 
Listing 16.2.22 and Table 14.3.10 provide ultrasound results (liver measurements and ascites) for all 
participants in the safety analysis set (n=355). Ultrasound measurement were done at defined 
timepoints per study protocol. 
Table 34 presents a summary of the number of participants who had ultrasound abnormalities, per the 
above protocol definition, from baseline by subgroups of pediatric (≤16 years of age) and adult (>16 
years of age) participants, and by treatment arm, as per Agency's request. In addition, abdominal 
ultrasound results are presented by treatment arm and participant ID for both the pediatric and adult 
subgroups (Listing 16.2.22). A similar number of participants in each treatment arm had hepatomegaly 
over the course of the study; and of those, most (~90%) experienced hepatomegaly by Day +30 post-
HSCT. Similar results were observed for both the pediatric and adult subgroups. During the study, 
ascites occurred in fewer participants than hepatomegaly, but similarly, minimal differences were 
observed between the treatment arms overall or for the age subgroups. The majority of observed 
ascites occurred by Day +30 post-HSCT. Fewer participants in the DP arm (n=24) reported both 
ascites and hepatomegaly while on study compared to participants in the BSC arm (n=33). Regardless 
of treatment arm, most of these observations were by Day +30 post-HSCT. It is worth noting that 
ascites and hepatomegaly can be experienced by patients post-HSCT and are not specific to VOD.

The requested abdominal ultrasound results have been provided; there were no clear differences in 
findings between treatment groups or age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
Conclusion

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 14. A summary of the variables recorded for the laboratory findings should be presented for the 
respective treatment group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis period, and at diagnosis of 
VOD and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period. These data should be provided for the 
overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) included all participants randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) 
arm who received at least 1 dose of defibrotide (n = 181) and all participants randomized to the best 
supportive care (BSC) arm who received at least 1 dose of study drug (n = 174) (Module 
5.3.5.4/Study 15-007 CSR/Figure 2). Of these, 25 participants in the DP arm and 31 participants in the 
BSC arm developed VOD, based on investigator assessment, and received defibrotide as rescue 
treatment.

Table 14.3.2.5.1, Table 14.3.2.6.1, and Table 14.3.2.7.1 provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, 
and coagulation laboratory results by treatment arm at baseline and Day +30 post- HSCT, with 
changes from baseline to Day +30 Post-HSCT. Table 14.3.2.5.2, Table 14.3.2.6.2, and Table 
14.3.2.7.2 provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, 
respectively, by treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD treatment, with 
changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment. All 6 analyses were performed 
for the overall SAS and by age subgroups (pediatric participants [≤ 16 years old] and adult participants 
[> 16 years]). 
Overall, no clinically meaningful differences in the mean and median laboratory values were observed 
between the DP and BSC treatment arms at the timepoints specified. Mean changes in laboratory 
parameters from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT were similar between the treatment arms for the 
overall SAS, as well as both age subgroups. Although some substantial changes in laboratory values 
from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment are observed between the 2 treatment 
arms, the results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants included the rescue 
phase were small, and those with laboratory values captured at both time points were even smaller. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
For the prophylaxis period and the overall safety analysis set as well as for paediatric subjects vs 
adults, no clear differences between the treatment groups are noted with regards to haematology, 
chemistry or coagulation laboratory values. 
Laboratory data on the day of VOD diagnosis as well as Day 30 post-VOD rescue treatment initiation is 
missing for many subjects diagnosed with VOD by investigators; no conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 15. For the additional safety concerns addressed by this study that are not covered by the above RSI, 
a summary of the main clinical findings should be presented. This pertains to thromboembolic events, patients with 
pre-existing liver disease, patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency and patients with intrinsic lung disease. Data 
should be presented for the respective treatment group at baseline and at day 30 post-HSCT for the prophylaxis 
period, and at diagnosis of VOD and at day +30 post-VOD treatment for the rescue treatment period, and should be 
provided for the overall study population (safety analysis set) and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs 
adults). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In study 15-007, the safety of defibrotide in patients with pre-existing liver disease, renal insufficiency, 
or intrinsic lung disease was generally consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide. The 
incidence of hemorrhage and thromboembolic events (important identified and potential risks, 
respectively in the defibrotide Risk Management Plan) were comparable in these subgroups between 
the DP and BSC arms of the study. In general, the safety profile of defibrotide was comparable 
between pediatric and adult participants. For events with a difference in incidence between pediatric 
and adult participants, these differences were consistent between the DP and BSC arms, suggesting 
age specific explanations rather than an effect of defibrotide. No new safety signals were identified in 
any of these subgroups overall or for the pediatric and adult age groups.

Participants with pre-existing liver disease 
Safety analyses, for the overall population and for pediatric (≤ 16 years old) and adult (> 16 years) 
subgroups, were performed for participants with pre-existing liver disease. A participant was 
determined to have pre-existing liver disease if they had any medical condition at baseline within the 
broad Hepatic disorders standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) or if they had abnormal hepatic function 
laboratory values at baseline that included asparagine aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin greater than the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, a similar number of participants were identified as 
having pre-existing liver disease in the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) and best supportive care (BSC) 
arms (DP n=111; BSC n=110). There were more pediatric than adult participants with pre-existing 
liver disease in the DP arm (pediatric n=70; adult n=41), and a relatively equal number of pediatric 
versus adult participants with pre-existing liver disease in the BSC arm (pediatric n=54; adult n=56) 
during the prophylaxis phase. In the rescue phase of the study, a similar number of participants were 
identified as having pre-existing liver disease in the DP and BSC arms (DP n=20; BSC n=21). There 
were also similar numbers of pediatric and adult participants with pre-existing liver disease in both the 
DP (pediatric n=11; adult n=9) and BSC (pediatric n=10; adult n=11) arms during the rescue phase. 
During the prophylaxis phase of study 15-007, the overall safety results in participants with pre-
existing liver disease were comparable between the DP and BSC arms. The frequencies of the most 
common adverse events (defined by occurrence in ≥ 15% of participants in either study arm, see Table 
35) were generally comparable between the DP and BSC arms. The most common Preferred Terms 
(PTs) that were reported with a ≥ 5% higher frequency in the DP arm compared to the BSC arm 
included Headache, Hypomagnesaemia, Hypotension, Abdominal pain, Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, 
and Nausea. The most common PTs that were reported by a ≥ 5% higher frequency in the BSC arm 
compared to the DP arm included Insomnia, Neutrophil count decreased, Platelet count decreased, 
Acute GvHD in skin, Alanine aminotransferase increased, Diarrhea, Stomatitis, and Constipation. The 
only PTs reported with a ≥ 10% difference between the DP and BSC arms were Insomnia and 
Neutrophil count decreased, and these both occurred with higher frequencies in the BSC arm.

During the prophylaxis phase, SAEs were reported in a higher percentage of participants with pre-
existing liver disease in the DP arm (42.3%) compared to the BSC arm (34.5%) (Table 14.3.7.5.2). 
There was no specific pattern to the PTs that accounted for this difference. The only SAEs reported in ≥ 
3 participants in the DP arm were Pyrexia (5.4%), Respiratory failure (4.5%), and Gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage (2.7%); and the only SAEs reported in ≥ 3 participants in the BSC arm were Pyrexia 
(5.5%), Diarrhoea (2.7%), Stomatitis (2.7%), and Acute GvHD in intestine (2.7%). 
During the prophylaxis phase, treatment-related AEs were reported in 20.7% of participants with pre-
existing liver disease in the DP arm (Table 14.3.7.5.3). The only treatment-related AEs reported in ≥ 3 
participants were associated with bleeding and included the PTs of Epistaxis (3.6%), Gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage (2.7%), and Haematochezia (2.7%). Bleeding events are consistent with the known 
safety profile of defibrotide. As expected in this open-label study where the comparator arm consists of 
supportive care, assessments of treatment relatedness were made only in the DP arm during the 
prophylaxis phase. 
During the prophylaxis phase, the overall incidence of bleeding events in participants with pre-existing 
liver disease was comparable between the DP (44.1%) and BSC (47.3%) arms (Table 14.3.7.5.6). The 
overall incidence of thromboembolic events in participants with pre-existing liver disease was low and 
comparable between the DP (3.6%) and BSC (6.4%) arms (Table 14.3.7.5.7). 
For participants with pre-existing liver disease during the rescue phase, the most commonly reported 
PTs in the DP arm were Venoocclusive disease, Diarrhoea, and Pyrexia; and for the BSC arm, 
Venoocclusive disease, Pyrexia, Acute kidney injury, and Hypotension (Table 36). The most common 
events in either arm were associated with VOD that developed as a complication of hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT). While the small populations of participants with pre-existing liver disease 
in the rescue phase limits the safety analysis, no new safety signals associated with defibrotide were 
evident.

Table 36. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events ≥ 20% in Either the DP or BSC Arm for 
Subjects with Pre-Existing Liver Disease (Rescue Phase) 
Within the DP arm, during the prophylaxis phase, some PTs were reported with a ≥ 10% difference 
between the pediatric and adult subgroups with pre-existing liver disease. Adverse events occurring 
more frequently for the pediatric subgroup include Sinus tachycardia, Hypomagnesaemia, Febrile 
neutropenia, Neutropenia, Vomiting, and Platelet count decreased (Table 14.3.7.5.1). Adverse events 
occurring more frequently for the adult subgroup include Headache, Nausea, Diarrhoea, Acute GvHD in 
skin, and Decreased appetite. For these events that showed a difference in incidence between pediatric 
and adult participants, a consistent and comparable difference was also generally seen between the 
pediatric and adult subgroups within the BSC arm. In the pediatric and adult subgroups of the DP arm, 
the overall incidence of SAEs (41.4% vs 43.9%, respectively), treatment-related AEs (20.0% vs 
22.0%, respectively), and bleeding events (42.9% vs 46.3% respectively) were comparable (Table 
14.3.7.5.2, Table 14.3.7.5.3, and Table 14.3.7.5.6, respectively). There were less thromboembolic 
events in pediatric (1.4%) than adult (7.3%) participants in the DP arm (Table 14.3.7.5.7). The small 
populations of participants with pre-existing liver disease in the rescue phase limits the safety analysis 
by age sub-groups during this study phase. Overall, while there were some differences in the safety 
results between pediatric and adult participants, they were generally consistent and comparable 
between the DP and BSC arms. 
For participants with pre-existing liver disease (overall, adult, and pediatric), Table 14.3.7.1.1 provides 
a summary of vital signs by treatment arm for baseline and Day +30 post- HSCT, with changes from 
baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.7.1.2 provides a summary of vital signs by 
treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD treatment with changes from 
VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment. Table 14.3.7.2.1, Table 14.3.7.3.1, and Table 
14.3.7.4.1 provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, 
respectively in participants with pre-existing liver disease by treatment arm at baseline and Day +30 
post-HSCT, with changes from baseline to Day +30 Post- HSCT. In these same populations, Table 
14.3.7.2.2, Table 14.3.7.3.2, and Table 14.3.7.4.2 provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, and 
Assessment report

coagulation laboratory results, respectively, by treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day 
+30 post-VOD treatment, with changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment. 
Overall, no clinically meaningful differences in the mean and median laboratory values and vital signs 
were observed between the DP and BSC treatment arms at the timepoints specified. Mean changes in 
laboratory parameters and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT were similar between the 
treatment arms for the overall population of participants with pre-existing liver disease, as well as both 
age subgroups. Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from VOD 
diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment are observed between the 2 treatment arms, the 
results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants included the rescue phase 
were small, and those with laboratory values and vital signs captured at both time points were even 
smaller. 
In this study, the safety of defibrotide in participants with pre-existing liver disease was consistent 
with the known safety profile of defibrotide and events commonly experienced in the study population. 
No new safety signals were detected in participants with pre-existing liver disease. 
Participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency 
Safety analyses, including for the overall population and for pediatric and adult participants, were 
performed for participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency. A participant was determined to have 
pre-existing renal insufficiency if they had abnormal renal function labs at baseline, including a serum 
creatinine elevated above the normal reference range or glomerular filtration rate/creatinine clearance 
below the normal reference range. 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, only a small number of participants were identified as 
having pre-existing renal insufficiency at baseline in either the DP (n=19) or BSC arms (n-25; Table 
14.3.8.5.1). There were more adult than pediatric participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency in 
both the DP (adult n=15; pediatric n=4) and the BSC arms (adult n=21; pediatric n=4) during the 
prophylaxis phase. In the rescue phase of the study, only 3 participants (all adults) in each treatment 
arm were identified as having pre-existing renal insufficiency. 
The analysis of safety in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency was limited due to the small 
populations in Study 15-007. During the prophylaxis phase, the overall safety results in participants 
with pre-existing renal insufficiency were comparable between the DP and BSC arms (Table 37). The 
frequencies of the most common adverse events (defined by occurrence in ≥ 20% of participants in 
either study arm) were generally comparable between the DP and BSC arms. The most common PTs 
that were reported with a ≥ 10% higher frequency in the DP arm compared to the BSC arm included 
Hypertension, Hypoalbuminaemia, Hypomagnesaemia, and Abdominal pain. The most common PTs 
that were reported by a ≥ 10% higher frequency in the BSC arm compared to the DP arm included 
Stomatitis, Acute GvHD in skin, Fatigue, Acute GvHD in intestine, and Hypotension.

Table 37. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events ≥ 20% in either the DP or BSC arm for 
Subjects with Pre-Existing Renal Insufficiency 
Serious adverse events were reported in similar percentages of participants with pre-existing renal 
insufficiency in the DP arm (31.6%) compared to the BSC arm (32%) during the prophylaxis phase 
(Table 14.3.8.5.2). No specific PT was reported as an SAE in more than 2 participants. A total of 6 
participants (31.6%) reported a treatment related AE in the DP arm during the prophylaxis phase 
(Table 14.3.8.5.3). Consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide, the majority of treatment 
related AEs represented bleeding events: Epistaxis (n=2) and Haemorrhage subcutaneous, Angina 
bullosa haemorrhagic, Gingival bleeding, and Catheter site haemorrhage [n=1 each]). As expected in

this open-label study where the comparator arm consists of supportive care, assessments of treatment 
relatedness were made only in the DP arm during the prophylaxis phase. 
During the prophylaxis phase, the overall incidence of bleeding events in participants with pre-existing 
renal insufficiency was comparable between the DP (57.9%) and BSC (52.0%) arms (Table 
14.3.8.5.6). The overall incidence of thromboembolic events in participants with pre-existing liver 
disease was comparable between the DP (10.5%) and BSC (12.0%) arms (Table 14.3.8.5.7). The 
small numbers of participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency during the rescue phase limits the 
analysis of safety during this phase of the study. 
An analysis of the safety of defibrotide in pediatric participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency at 
baseline is limited by the fact that overall only 4 such participants were identified in either arm of 
Study 15-007, with no pediatric participants receiving rescue treatment. 
For participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency (overall, adult, and pediatric), Table 14.3.8.1.1 
provides a summary of vital signs by treatment arm for baseline and Day +30 post-HSCT, with 
changes from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.8.1.2 provides a summary of vital 
signs by treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and Day +30 post-
VOD treatment with changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment. Table 
14.3.8.2.1, Table 14.3.8.3.1, and Table 14.3.8.4.1 provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, and 
coagulation laboratory results, respectively, in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency by 
treatment arm at baseline and Day +30 post- HSCT, with changes from baseline to Day +30 Post-
HSCT. In these same populations, Table 14.3.8.2.2, Table 14.3.8.3.2, and Table 14.3.8.4.2 provide 
summaries of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, respectively, by treatment 
arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD treatment, with changes from VOD 
diagnosis to Day +30 Post- VOD rescue treatment. 
Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-
HSCT and from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment are observed between the 2 
treatment arms, the results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants with pre-
existing renal insufficiency is very small, and those with laboratory values and vital signs captured at 
both time points were even smaller. 
In this study, the safety of defibrotide in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency was 
consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide and events commonly experienced in the study 
population. While the safety analysis was limited by the small number of participants with pre-existing 
renal insufficiency, no new safety signals were detected in these participants. 
Participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease 
Safety analyses were performed for participants (overall, pediatric, and adult populations) with pre-
existing intrinsic lung disease. A patient was determined to have pre-existing intrinsic lung disease if 
they had any medical condition at baseline within the High Level Group Terms (HLGTs) of Bronchial 
disorders (excl neoplasms), Congenital respiratory tract disorders, Lower respiratory tract disorders 
(excl obstruction and infection), Neonatal respiratory disorders, Respiratory disorders NEC, and 
Respiratory tract neoplasms. 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, only a small number of participants were identified as 
having pre-existing intrinsic lung disease at baseline in either the DP (n=8) or BSC arms (n=9; Table 
14.3.9.5.1). In the prophylaxis phase, there were more pediatric than adult participants with pre-
existing intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm (pediatric n=7; adult n=1) and less pediatric than adult 
participants in the BSC arm (pediatric n=3; adult n=6). Few participants with pre-existing intrinsic 
lung were included in the rescue phase (DP n=1; BSC n=2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 138/194 
 
 
 
The analysis of safety in participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease was limited due to the 
very small populations in Study 15-007. During the prophylaxis phase, for patients with pre-existing 
intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm, the most commonly PTs reported included Hypokalaemia (n=6), 
Pyrexia (n=5) and Anaemia, Neutropenia, and Hypomagnesaemia (n=4 each) (Table 14.3.9.5.1). For 
the BSC arm, the most common reported PTs included Stomatitis (n=6) and Diarrhoea, Epistaxis, 
Hypomagnesaemia, and Platelet count decreased (n=4 each). 
During the prophylaxis phase, SAEs were reported in 4 participants (50%) with pre-existing intrinsic 
lung disease in the DP arm and 2 participants (22.2%) in the BSC arm (Table 14.3.9.5.2). No PT was 
reported as serious in more than 1 participant in the DP arm. Treatment-related AEs were reported in 
2 participants with intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm of the prophylaxis phase; events included 
Cerebral haemorrhage and Haemoptysis (Table 14.3.9.5.3), consistent with the known safety profile of 
defibrotide. As expected in this open-label study where the comparator arm consists of supportive 
care, assessments of treatment relatedness were made only in the DP arm during the prophylaxis 
phase. 
An analysis of the safety of defibrotide during the rescue phase and in pediatric versus adult 
participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease is limited by the small populations. 
For participants with pre-existing lung disease, Table 14.3.9.1.1 provides a summary of vital signs by 
treatment arm for baseline and Day +30 post-HSCT, with changes from baseline to Day +30 post-
HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.9.1.2 provides a summary of vital signs by treatment arm at the time of 
diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD treatment with changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 
post-VOD rescue treatment. Table 14.3.9.2.1, Table 14.3.9.3.1, and Table 14.3.9.4.1 provide 
summaries of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, respectively, in participants 
with pre-existing lung disease by treatment arm at baseline and Day +30 post-HSCT, with changes 
from baseline to Day +30 Post-HSCT. In these same populations, Table 14.3.9.2.2, Table 14.3.9.3.2, 
and Table 14.3.9.4.2 provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, 
respectively, by treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD treatment, with 
changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment. 
Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-
HSCT and from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment are observed between the 2 
treatment arms, the results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants with pre-
existing intrinsic lung disease are very small, and those with laboratory values and vital signs captured 
at both time points were even smaller. 
While very few participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease received defibrotide in this study, 
limiting the analysis of safety, no new safety signals were detected in these participants. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH states that in study 15-007, the safety of defibrotide in patients with pre-existing liver 
disease, renal insufficiency, or intrinsic lung disease was generally consistent with the known safety 
profile of defibrotide, and that the incidence of haemorrhage and thromboembolic events (important 
identified and potential risks, respectively in the defibrotide RMP) were comparable in these subgroups 
between the DP and BSC arms of the study as well as between paediatric and adult participants; 
differences in incidence between paediatric and adult participants were consistent between the DP and 
BSC arms, suggesting age specific explanations rather than an effect of defibrotide. No comparison 
between the population who had the respective disease at baseline and the entire safety population in 
study 15-007 has been provided.

For liver disease, this was defined as any medical condition at baseline within Hepatic disorders or if 
they had abnormal hepatic function laboratory values at baseline including AST, ALT, or total bilirubin 
greater than ULN. This definition is considered very broad as especially laboratory fluctuations in liver 
function tests are common also necessarily relate to underlying liver disease. Based on this definition, 
the majority of subjects in Study 15-007 had pre-existing liver disease; 111 subjects in the defibrotide 
group (out of 190 randomised subjects) and 110 subjects in the best supportive care group (out of 182 
randomised subjects). To aid in assessment of this issue, an analysis of subjects in study 15-007 who 
had pre-existing liver disease based on a defined medical condition of hepatic disorder should be 
provided. The safety profile should be discussed not only in relation to best supportive care but also in 
relation to the overall safety population (including a division by paediatric and adult subjects). (LoQ) 
For pre-existing renal insufficiency, it is found reasonable to consider participants with abnormal renal 
function tests at baseline, although this is also considered a somewhat broad definition that will 
capture also those with a transient decrease in glomerular filtration. Nevertheless, rather few subjects 
were identified as having pre-existing renal insufficiency; 19 subjects in the defibrotide group and 25 
subjects in the best supportive care group. Some findings are of interest, including the discrepancy in 
hypertension and hypomagnesaemia that were more frequently reported in both paediatric and adult 
subjects who received defibrotide as compared to best supportive care among subjects with pre-
existing renal insufficiency, as well as hypokalaemia that was observed in 3 out of 4 paediatric subjects 
in the defibrotide group and 0 of the 4 paediatric subjects in the best supportive care group. These 
findings should be discussed in more detail, including a discussion in relation to the overall safety 
population (including a division by paediatric and adult subjects). (LoQ) 
There were few participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease at baseline: 8 subjects in the 
defibrotide group and 9 subjects in the best supportive care group. Despite that the numbers are few, 
also for this safety concern, the MAH is asked to discuss the safety findings in relation to the overall 
safety population. (LoQ) 
Conclusion 
Issue partly resolved. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
SmPC 
Question 16. Since previous prophylactic studies have been included in the SmPC and since study 15-007 also 
includes study data on treatment with defibrotide for VOD as well as paediatric data, the SmPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 
should be updated to include data from study 15-007. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges the request to update the mentioned sections of the SmPC with the data from 
study 15-007 and provides the following response per section: 
4.8 
• 
No changes to the ADR table will be proposed. Even though the patient population in Study 
2004-000592-33 is similar to that of the PVOD study, the decision to further pool the table would not 
be in alignment with the indicated population of the label. At the time of the original MAA, there was 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 140/194 
 
 
 
 
limited safety data available under the indication of treatment of severe VOD. Inclusion of data in other 
indications, such as PVOD, provided a more robust safety analyses for the SmPC. However, extensive 
safety data is now available from multiple sources, such as the completed phase III treatment-IND 
Study (Study 2006-05) and years of safety reports from post-marketing use, which have both 
confirmed the known safety profile of defibrotide. As such, the inclusion of data in unapproved 
indications is no longer warranted, in particular since no new safety signals have been identified in 
Study 15-007. Furthermore, the MAH would not consider it appropriate to pool the data from the VOD 
treatment and the VOD prevention studies, given the differences in study designs. Specifically, the 
administration of Defitelio for treatment typically occurs several weeks after transplant, unlike the 
current study. 
• 
In regards to the pediatric sub-section, again no updates will be proposed. The current SmPC 
describes an increased incidence of any bleeding events in the defibrotide group compared with the 
treatment group in the paediatric prevention study at 25 mg/kg/day (Study 2004-000592-33). In 
Study 15-007, the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage events were generally comparable between 
pediatric and adult participants (12.7% vs 11.6%, respectively [Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 
14.3.1.18]) during the prophylaxis phase. The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding events were low 
overall, but moderately higher in pediatric versus adult participants (5.5% vs 3.3%, respectively 
[Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.3.1.20]). However, differences in the incidence of bleeding 
events between pediatric and adult participants were consistent between the DP and BSC arms of the 
study, suggesting defibrotide was not a contributing factor. Overall, no new safety signals were 
detected in the pediatric population of Study 15-007. 
5.1 
• 
• 
A summary of the efficacy results from the primary endpoint is now provided. 
In the pediatric sub-section although not directly associated with Study 15-007 the MAH has 
updated this section to clarify that the efficacy and safety of Defitelio use has been identified in several 
studies other than the prevention study. Studies being: 2005-01 Pivotal study, 2006-05 T-IND (Full 
CSR) and 99-118: Dose finding 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The argumentation that safety data from study 15-007 should not be included for the pooled safety 
data in section 4.8 is somewhat difficult to follow, given that at least one previous prevention-study 
has been included in that pool. However, the MAH has previously stated that the safety data from 
study 15-007 are in line with the label for section 4.8. Thus, no amendments are warranted. 
For section 5.1, the proposed summary is not sufficient. The findings form study 5.1 should be 
provided in an unbiased manner including actual numbers for the relevant data. This pertains primarily 
to the results from the primary efficacy endpoint, but also other relevant data, especially safety data, 
could be of clear interest for prescribers; the actual data to include will be further assessed within the 
next round depending on the data presented with responses to the 2nd LoQ. 
For the paediatric sub-section, the proposed amendments are not fully accepted; see attached SmPC 
with comments.

13.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
Safety 
1. The numerical imbalance in study 15-007 on mortality both during the prophylaxis phase, with a 
higher mortality in the defibrotide group as compared to best supportive care, as well as during the 
rescue phase, especially among those initially randomised to defibrotide, should be further addressed. 
These data are in line with previous prophylaxis data indicating increased mortality with defibrotide, 
particularly in the paediatric population. The response should include the following: 
a. The survival data separated by subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 who received 
defibrotide and those diagnosed with VOD who did not receive defibrotide. Any difference should be 
discussed, including any differences in clinical findings between these groups that could be of 
relevance. 
b. A discussion on the findings of higher mortality in the rescue phase among those initially 
randomised to defibrotide as compared to those initially randomised to best supportive care, including 
any differences in clinical findings between these groups that could be of relevance. 
c. A discussion of the mortality findings during both prophylaxis and treatment of VOD in study 15-007 
in relation to the totality of data on mortality based on relevant previous prophylaxis studies and VOD-
treatment studies. This should include whether there are any clinical characteristics that could be 
relevance in relation to mortality risk as well as a separate discussion on paediatric patients.

Clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
2.  In table 4 in the response document, there are 96 events of VOD as assessed by the EPAC and 
43 events of VOD as assessed by investigators (38 + 3 + 2) by Day +100 post-HSCT. 
However, with a reference to listing 16.2.7.3, it is stated that there were 56 participants 
diagnosed with VOD by investigators by Day +100. The MAH should clarify why these 13 
participants are not included in the description of concordance between EPAC and investigators 
as outlined in Response Table 4. 
Safety 
3.  Data on VOD-resolution in subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 should be 
provided, divided by those who received defibrotide and those diagnosed with VOD who did not 
receive defibrotide, for the entire study population and divided by age groups (paediatric 
subjects vs adults).

4.  The immunogenicity data should be provided within this procedure. 
5.  An analysis of subjects in study 15-007 who had pre-existing liver disease based on a defined 
medical condition of hepatic disorder at baseline should be provided. The safety profile should 
be discussed not only in relation to best supportive care but also in relation to the overall 
safety population. 
6.  The findings of hypertension, hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia in the defibrotide group

Question 1. The numerical imbalance in study 15-007 on mortality both during the prophylaxis phase, with a 
higher mortality in the defibrotide group as compared to best supportive care, as well as during the rescue phase, 
especially among those initially randomised to defibrotide, should be further addressed. These data are in line with 
previous prophylaxis data indicating increased mortality with defibrotide, particularly in the paediatric population. 
The response should include the following: 
a. The survival data separated by subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 who received defibrotide and 
those diagnosed with VOD who did not receive defibrotide. Any difference should be discussed, including any 
differences in clinical findings between these groups that could be of relevance. 
b. A discussion on the findings of higher mortality in the rescue phase among those initially randomised to 
defibrotide as compared to those initially randomised to best supportive care, including any differences in clinical 
findings between these groups that could be of relevance. 
c. A discussion of the mortality findings during both prophylaxis and treatment of VOD in study 15-007 in relation to 
the totality of data on mortality based on relevant previous prophylaxis studies and VOD-treatment studies. This 
should include whether there are any clinical characteristics that could be relevance in relation to mortality risk as 
well as a separate discussion on paediatric patients.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Study 15-007 was designed to collect additional data to support the safety of defibrotide in a 
randomized multicenter clinical trial. The study was a phase 3 clinical study using an adaptive design 
comparing the efficacy and safety of defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) in addition to best supportive care 
(BSC) versus BSC alone in the prevention of hepatic VOD in adult and pediatric participants undergoing 
HSCT who were at high risk or at very high risk of developing VOD. The study was not designed to 
assess or compare the efficacy and safety of defibrotide treatment of VOD during the rescue phase of 
the study. A total of 372 participants were randomized and included in the final analysis of the study, 
which was in line with the originally anticipated study sample size. A schematic diagram of study 15-
007 design is presented in Figure 1. 
All participants in either arm of the study who were diagnosed with VOD based on Principal 
Investigator (PI) assessment received defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day as rescue treatment. 
The prophylaxis phase of the study started on the baseline date and ended on the date of study 
completion/early termination. If VOD occurred, the prophylaxis phase started on the baseline date and 
ended on the day before the start date of rescue defibrotide (ie, rescue treatment start date minus 1). 
The rescue phase was defined as the start date of rescue defibrotide treatment and ended on the date 
of study completion/early termination. 
The MAH has performed an in-depth investigation of the study data and found that mortality results 
are in fact not imbalanced, but similar, for participants by the randomized treatment arms. After 
investigating the safety data in great detail, the MAH concludes that there was no imbalance in 
mortality between the 2 study arms, no new safety signals for defibrotide have been observed in this

study and that the safety results are comparable between the 2 arms in both phases (prophylaxis and 
rescue) of the study. Safety data from Study 15-007 are consistent with the known safety profile of 
defibrotide. The MAH will illustrate the following foundational points related to the design and analyses 
of Study 15-007 and highlight several factors that have contributed to the observed results presented 
in the Study 15-007 final CSR. 
•Randomization to DP arm versus BSC arm only occurred once – at the start of the prophylaxis phase. 
Results from the study prophylaxis phase provide interpretable comparisons and are presented in 
response to Question (Q)1c. Study 15-007 was not designed to evaluate defibrotide for the treatment 
of VOD, which would have required randomization to defibrotide or comparator to occur after VOD 
diagnosis with or without preceding prophylaxis. Doing so would enable evaluation of treatment 
efficacy between the 2 treatment arms; however, in the absence of this, there is no reliable 
comparison for treated vs untreated VOD events as it would be confounded by the clinician's diagnosis 
of VOD, since all participants (except one participant who withdrew at VOD diagnosis) determined to 
have VOD by the treating physician (ie, Principal Investigator [PI]) were given defibrotide as rescue 
treatment. Therefore, any group/s resulting post-randomization are not valid comparators and violate 
the principle of randomization. 
•Per study protocol and final Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the primary and key secondary endpoints 
of the study were based on an independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC) assessment of 
VOD diagnosis. Both EPAC and PIs used the Modified Seattle Criteria (MSC) in their assessment of VOD 
diagnosis. However, the following are important differences: 
−The diagnosis of VOD, based on the MSC criteria (a highly sensitive and less specific criteria 
[McDonald, 1993]), requires real-time clinical judgement, close monitoring of patients with a 
multidisciplinary team approach to ensure correct diagnosis and management. EPAC assessment of 
VOD was performed using treatment-blinded, electronic review of participants’ data; the assessment 
was performed remotely and retrospectively. 
−VOD events identified by the EPAC for the most part are not the same as VOD events identified by 
the PI, who deemed defibrotide rescue treatment necessary hence, more severe VOD. Any comparison 
during the rescue phase between defibrotide-treated VOD (specifically, VOD diagnosed by both PI and 
EPAC) and EPAC-only identified VOD, yet untreated with defibrotide, is confounded because cases 
identified by EPAC only would be either incorrect or so mild as to not require treatment with defibrotide 
according to the assessment of the PI and the multidisciplinary clinical care team. 
−Survival of participants who were diagnosed with VOD by PI and treated with defibrotide rescue 
treatment is consistent with efficacy data of defibrotide from previous studies (Richardson, 2019; 
Richardson, 2016). A retrospective review by the MAH of data from EPAC adjudication indicates that 
participants diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only (ie, not by PI), and who therefore did not receive 
defibrotide rescue treatment, had not experienced clinical VOD (refer to Q1a andQ1c) hence, do not 
make a valid comparator group for those who received defibrotide rescue treatment. 
Based on the Agency request, the MAH has performed the requested analyses, and further details are 
provided on the differences in survival analyzed by VOD diagnosis and defibrotide rescue treatment 
(Q1a), as well as mortality during the rescue phase by randomized groups (Q1b) with an assessment 
of relevant clinical findings. Furthermore, the MAH provides a detailed discussion on the overall 
mortality findings during both phases of the Study 15-007 (prophylaxis phase and rescue treatment 
phase) in context with all previously-completed VOD-prophylaxis and VOD-treatment studies 
evaluating defibrotide, including an additional discussion with respect to pediatric patients (Q1c).

MAH response to 1a, survival data: 
In Study 15-007, an Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC) was set up to provide independent, 
blinded, medical review and adjudication of VOD diagnosis for the analyses of the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints in the study. EPAC-assessed VOD diagnosis was based on the Modified 
Seattle Criteria (MSC), per study protocol, and was conducted from electronic review of participants’ 
data, remotely and retrospectively. EPAC assessment of VOD did not dictate or influence whether the 
participant received defibrotide rescue treatment. Only participants with Principal Investigator (PI)-
assessed VOD were administered defibrotide rescue treatment as is the case in everyday clinical 
practice. 
Per the Agency’s request, additional analysis on survival data is provided for participants diagnosed 
with VOD by EPAC who then received defibrotide rescue treatment (thus were also diagnosed with VOD 
by the PI) versus those diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only who did not receive defibrotide treatment 
(as they were not diagnosed with VOD by the PI). 
Based on the revised concordance analysis by Day +100 post-HSCT, a total of 104 participants were 
diagnosed with VOD based on EPAC-assessment (please refer to Q2). A total of 57 participants were 
diagnosed with VOD by the PI; however, one participant (Participant ID 8108-1002) was withdrawn on 
the day of VOD diagnosis and did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment (shown in Table 3). 
A total of 44 participants had VOD diagnosed both by EPAC and PI, all of whom received defibrotide 
rescue treatment, with the exception of 1 participant (Participant ID 8108-1002) who was withdrawn 
from the study on the date of VOD diagnosis by PI. In cases where the PI did not diagnose VOD by 
Day +100 post-HSCT (n=60), none of the participants were administered defibrotide rescue treatment 
as per the study design. The 1 participant mentioned above, who withdrew from the study, is included 
in the 61 participants in Table 1 since defibrotide rescue treatment was not administered despite the 
VOD being diagnosed by both EPAC and PI. 
Table 1 presents the survival analysis for participants diagnosed with VOD by EPAC and by 
administration of defibrotide rescue treatment (yes or no).

As per Table 1, the participants who were diagnosed with VOD by both EPAC and PI and who therefore 
received defibrotide rescue treatment had worse survival than participants diagnosed with VOD by 
EPAC only. Of the participants diagnosed by both EPAC and PI, 23 (53.5%) died. In this subgroup, the 
median survival was 110 days from the date of HSCT (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.0, not 
estimable [NE]). For participants with VOD diagnoses by both EPAC and PI, the survival rate by Day 
+100 post-HSCT was 54.7% (95% CI: 37.9%, 68.8%) (Table 14.2.6.1.7b), which is consistent with 
published evidence on efficacy of defibrotide on survival in patients diagnosed with VOD (Richardson, 
2016; Richardson 2019). 
On the other hand, of the participants diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only, who did not receive 
defibrotide rescue therapy, 11 (18.0%) died. In this subgroup, the median survival was not reached. 
Importantly, survival in this subgroup, the estimated survival rate at Day +100 post-HSCT (n=61; 
82.8% [95%CI: 70.3%, 90.4%]), was similar to the estimated survival rate at Day+100 for 
participants who were not diagnosed with VOD by either PI or EPAC in Study 15-007 (n=255; 92.6% 
[95%CI: 88.3%, 95.3%];Table 14.2.6.1.7a), and is also consistent with published evidence of the high 
survival rate observed in patients post-HSCT who are not diagnosed with VOD (Baker, 2003).

With respect to the Agency’s request and analysis presented in Table 1, the MAH will present below 
that major differences in baseline factors existed between the 2 groups of participants diagnosed with 
VOD by EPAC (those who were treated and not treated with defibrotide); as well, as the criteria that 
defined their VOD events. Indeed, a higher survival rate in the group diagnosed with VOD only by 
EPAC is expected and is consistent with survival in patients who do not develop VOD post-HSCT 
(Baker, 2003). A detailed review and post hoc analysis of the EPAC assessment of VOD and relevant 
clinical findings between these 2 groups of participants (VOD treated and not treated with defibrotide 
rescue) are described below. This survival analysis cannot be interpreted as a sound estimate of the 
treatment effect of defibrotide for the following reasons: 
The data analysis requested by the Agency to compare groups of participants who were diagnosed with 
VOD by EPAC who received or did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment is not an appropriate or 
valid comparison. The study was not designed to evaluate defibrotide treatment of VOD. Furthermore, 
there was no additional randomization following the diagnosis of VOD by the PI. In the absence of this 
post-VOD randomization, no definitive comparison between treated participants versus untreated 
participants can be made. The 2 groups of participants (treated and untreated) are defined by 
disagreement in VOD diagnosis between EPAC (who did not influence treatment of VOD) and the PI 
(who did dictate treatment of VOD based on their own diagnosis). Upon further review of the EPAC 
assessment, participants who were diagnosed with VOD only by EPAC (but not by PI) likely did not 
experience clinical VOD (n=60), and thus, are not a valid comparator group for the additional analysis. 
VOD cases that were diagnosed by both EPAC and the PI and required defibrotide treatment, as 
determined by the PI, were at higher risk of developing VOD as shown in Table 2 and had a more 
severe presentation of VOD. Thus, any comparison between defibrotide-treated VOD (specifically, VOD 
diagnosed by both PI and EPAC) and EPAC-identified, but untreated VOD, is confounded by the clinical 
diagnosis of VOD made by the PI and the multidisciplinary treatment team. The 43 participants who 
had VOD diagnosed by both EPAC and PI represent only a proportion (43/56, 76.8%) of all participants 
diagnosed with VOD by PI who received defibrotide rescue treatment. Therefore, any analysis based on 
EPAC diagnosis of VOD and treatment with defibrotide (yes or no) does not include all participants 
diagnosed with VOD by PI who received defibrotide rescue treatment. The results could be biased and 
are difficult to interpret correctly. Furthermore, Table 2 presents baseline characteristics that are 
known risk factors associated with developing VOD post-HSCT (Cairo, 2020; Mohty, 2020) for 
participants in Study 15-007 with EPAC-assessed VOD who were treated with defibrotide compared 
with those who were not treated with defibrotide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 148/194 
 
 
 
 
All risk factors listed in Table 2, with the exception of matched unrelated transplant, were higher in 
participants diagnosed with VOD by both EPAC and PI and who therefore received defibrotide 
(diagnosis agreement) compared to patients with VOD diagnosed by EPAC only who did not receive 
defibrotide (diagnosis disagreement). This is consistent with the inference that the PI diagnosed the 
more severe form of VOD while EPAC-only VOD cases were either incorrectly classified or much milder. 
Prior use of ozogamicin (gemtuzumab or inotuzumab) is the number one risk factor associated with the 
development of VOD (> 10-times greater risk) (Cairo, 2020). The prior use of ozogamicin was 13.0% 
greater for the participants treated with defibrotide rescue treatment. The use of myeloablative 
conditioning, which may have included busulfan or fludarabine-based regimens), and is associated with 
a 3- to 10-times greater risk of developing VOD, was another notable difference with a 23.8% greater 
incidence of use for participants who received defibrotide rescue treatment. 
In addition, the incidence of participants who had haploidentical HLA mismatched donor transplants 
was 21.1% greater in the participants who received defibrotide rescue treatment (ie, diagnosed with 
VOD by both EPAC and PI) versus did not (ie, diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only). 
Taken together, these clinical data illustrate that these 2 groups of participants were not balanced at 
baseline and participants who ultimately developed VOD as assessed by both PI and EPAC were at a 
much greater risk, and likely had more severe cases of VOD compared to those diagnosed only by 
EPAC. 
It is clear that diagnosis of VOD requires a holistic view of the patient’s condition over time and often 
involves a multidisciplinary team decision. The PI, within a multidisciplinary team, was closely 
monitoring the participant’s condition daily, and had access to more details of the participant’s case 
history, enabling clinical judgement to provide a differential diagnosis other than VOD and to rule out a 
diagnosis based on an isolated or transitory elevation in an MSC criterion parameter. In contrast, given 
the remote and retrospective assessment by EPAC, it is unlikely that all of the relevant clinical factors 
could be taken into consideration (please see below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 149/194 
 
 
 
 
The use of MSC is regarded as a guideline (not an algorithm) for diagnosis but does not guide 
treatment decisions. MSC is a high-sensitivity, low-specificity tool with a limitation in assessing the 
severity of VOD (McDonald ,1993). Study 15-007 illustrated some of the challenges with diagnosing 
VOD in this manner, namely the tendency for EPAC to over-diagnose VOD based on point estimates 
such as isolated or transient conditions (weight increase, elevated bilirubin, hepatomegaly, and 
ascites) using MSC as an algorithm in isolation. While the EPAC adjudication process used in this study 
was a recommended 2+1+1 model, significant discrepancies in their diagnosis of VOD were evident 
even between the adjudicators themselves. On examining the EPAC activity report, the following were 
observed: 
Note: The adjudication model (2+1) included 3 rounds as follows: Round 1- two EPAC adjudicators 
reviewed participants' data independently to assess if the participant had VOD. If both adjudicators 
arrived at the same diagnosis, the adjudication was considered complete. If the two adjudicators were 
discrepant in their diagnosis, the patient data was reviewed in Round 2 by a 3rd independent 
adjudicator. If this 3rd adjudicator agreed with either one from round 1 the patient was considered 
complete in Round 2. If the 3rd adjudicator’s diagnosis did not agree with either adjudicator in the first 
round the patient was adjudicated in a consensus meeting in round 3. (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Section 8.9.7) The majority of participants (67/104 [64.4%]) diagnosed with VOD by EPAC in 
Study 15-007 required 2 or more rounds of review before a final diagnosis was confirmed due to 
discrepancy in the diagnosis by the different adjudication members (EPAC Activity Report - 
spreadsheet available upon request). Of the cases with disagreement in diagnosis by EPAC and PI, 
approximately one-third of cases were potentially disputed or borderline cases as annotated by the 
EPAC, in which a differential diagnosis/causal factor (preparative regimen, chemotherapy, pre-existing 
liver disease, underlying malignancy, or temporary condition – often volume overload from fluid 
management leading to isolated weight gain) was more likely the cause for meeting an MSC parameter 
than a true VOD diagnosis. In the cases with agreement in diagnosis by EPAC and PI, very few 
participants were notated by the EPAC as borderline or potentially disputable, and no cases were given 
a differential diagnosis. Over half of the cases with disagreement in diagnosis by EPAC and PI relied on 
a transient or isolated parameter to meet MSC for diagnosis. In many of these cases, 2 criteria led to 
the diagnosis and an isolated and/or transient increase in weight was the determining factor for EPAC 
diagnosis. As noted by an EPAC member on many of these cases, the transient increase in weight was 
likely due to volume overload, which is a common occurrence due to fluid management given as 
standard of care in this setting, yet the VOD diagnosis was not overturned. Evaluating the details of 
the MSC criteria used in each case for VOD diagnosis by EPAC and specifically, between the cases with 
VOD diagnosis by PI (“diagnosis agreement”) or no diagnosis by PI (“diagnosis disagreement”), there 
were notable clinically-meaningful differences observed. In the “diagnosis agreement” cases, 91% 
involved an elevation of bilirubin; whereas, in the “diagnosis disagreement” cases, only 28% involved 
an elevation of bilirubin (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/ Listing 16.2.7.1 and Listing 16.2.7.2). Based 
on published evidence, patients with VOD and hyperbilirubinemia have reduced Day +100 post-HSCT 
survival (54% versus 87%) and a higher incidence of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD; 41% versus 
26%) (Corbacioglu, 2020). In one study, anicteric VOD cases (VOD cases without hyperbilirubinemia) 
were observed in 15% and 29% of adult and pediatric cases, respectively (Corbacioglu 2020). In Study 
15-007, 72% of participants with “diagnosis disagreement” cases were anicteric, which is significantly 
higher than historical evidence, while for the “diagnosis agreement” cases, incidence of anicteric VOD 
(9% of cases) was more in-line with published literature. 
The discrepancies in VOD diagnosis largely explains the difference in survival between the cases where 
diagnosis of VOD was by EPAC only and therefore, the participants did not receive defibrotide (ie, were 
unlikely true clinical cases of VOD), and the cases of VOD diagnosed by both EPAC and PI (severe 
cases of VOD diagnosed also by PI, and therefore, received defibrotide rescue treatment). Since any 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 150/194 
 
 
 
comparison between these 2 subgroups of participants is confounded, a high-level comparison 
between Study 15-007 results and historical data was assessed. The estimated Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
survival at Day +100 post-HSCT in participants who had VOD diagnosis by both EPAC and PI and who 
received defibrotide rescue (54.7%; Table 14.2.6.1.7b) is consistent with historical/published Day 
+100 survival rates from defibrotide treatment studies ranging between 38.2 to 56% (Richardson, 
2019; Richardson, 2016). 
Since the cases diagnosed by both EPAC and PI did not include all participants who received defibrotide 
rescue treatment, a survival analysis based on PI assessment of VOD is more appropriate. Table 3 
presents the survival analysis for participants diagnosed with VOD based on PI assessment. Overall, of 
the 56 participants with PI-diagnosed VOD, fewer than half (n=27; 48.2%) died on study. The KM 
estimated survival rate at Day +100 post-HSCT in the PI diagnosed VOD cases who were treated with 
defibrotide rescue treatment is 59.6% (95% CI: 44.9%, 71.6%; Table 14.2.6.1.7a), consistent with 
known efficacy data of defibrotide in treatment VOD (Richardson, 2019; Richardson, 2016). 
In summary, the overall survival in participants who developed VOD and received defibrotide rescue 
treatment is consistent with known survival data on defibrotide from published literature (Richardson, 
2019; Richardson, 2016). The survival in participants with VOD diagnosed only by EPAC, and 
therefore, who did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment, is consistent with the overall survival in 
patients undergoing HSCT without developing VOD (Baker, 2003). The cumulative results of the 
analyses presented, which are consistent with the literature, provides strong evidence that the 2 
groups of participants with VOD diagnosed by EPAC (treated and not treated with defibrotide) are very 
different: 1 group who did not experience true clinical VOD and had a better overall prognosis, and 
another group that had very high risk for developing VOD and developed severe VOD and, hence, 
required rescue treatment with defibrotide. Thus, no comparison or conclusion can be drawn regarding 
defibrotide VOD treatment in Study 15-007, which was designed to evaluate defibrotide prophylaxis 
and not treatment of VOD.

Assessor's comment: 
A clear strength of study 15-007 is the external blinded endpoint adjudication committee (EPAC), 
that was provided with clinical data to assess whether VOD occurred or not. It is fully agreed that 
establishing the diagnosis of VOD could be difficult. The limitations with the modified Seattle criteria 
are also well known. Nevertheless, for this study, both the EPAC and the principal investigators had 
access to similar clinical data and utilised the same criteria for diagnosis. The argument that ‘real-
time clinical judgement, close monitoring of patients with a multidisciplinary team approach’ could 
strengthen the diagnostic ability has not been justified by any actual clinical data that were taken 
into account by investigators but not provided to the EPAC. Thus, the discordance between 
investigators and the EPAC could be due to underlying bias resulting from investigators being non-
blinded to study treatment. 
Notably, the authorisation of defibrotide relied on clinical data from one open-label pivotal trial with 
a historical control group for which VOD was retrospectively assessed. Therefore, the MAH 
argumentation warrants some caution regarding any lack of robustness of retrospective, remote 
assessment of VOD. 
The overall survival among those who received defibrotide as rescue treatment was clearly higher 
among those who were diagnosed by the EPAC only (and therefore were not treated with 
defibrotide); 11/61 or 18% of these subjects died as compared to 23/43 or 53.5% of those who 
were diagnosed as VOD by both EPAC and investigators (and were therefore treated with 
defibrotide). The survival at Day +100 post-HSCT among individuals in study 15-007 who did not 
develop VOD (n = 255) was higher (92.6%) as compared to those who developed VOD as diagnosed 
by the EPAC only (n = 61, survival 82.8%). 
The attempt to present data on risk factors for VOD at baseline is appreciated; some differences are 
noted between those with a VOD diagnosis by the EPAC and those diagnosed by investigators only. 
However, several well recognised risk factors were not included among the presented data, such as 
(degree of) liver disease, pulmonary function and underlying disease (ie cause of HSCT). Unrelated 
donors appear more frequent among those diagnosed by the EPAC only, whereas myeloablative 
conditioning was more frequent among those who received defibrotide as rescue treatment 
(including busulfan and fludarabine conditioning). More than half of patients in both these groups 
had a ‘very high risk’ of VOD, 27/43 or 62.8% among those diagnosed by investigators and 32/61 or 
52.5% of those diagnosed by the EPAC. Nevertheless, the relevance of these data to support 
whether subjects actually developed VOD or not are unclear. 
The extensive argumentation on why EPAC-diagnosed subjects with VOD actually did not actually 
have VOD is noted; notably, this could question the entire study design given that the primary 
endpoint was EPAC-adjudicated VOD. It is argued that among EPAC-adjudicated cases of VOD, a 
differential diagnosis or causal factor was often more likely than actual VOD, examples including 
preparative regimen, chemotherapy, pre-existing liver disease, underlying malignancy, or temporary 
condition such as volume overload. However, these factors are well known risk factors and/or 
symptoms of VOD and thus, the argumentation is somewhat difficult to follow. The only clinical 
factor that is described to differ between subjects diagnosed as VOD by both investigators and the 
EPAC, and those diagnosed by the EPAC only, is elevation of bilirubin; notably, however, subjects 
diagnosed only by investigators were older (median age 17 years; Table 1 above) than EPAC-
diagnosed subjects (median age 10 years); anicteric VOD is well known to be more frequent among 
paediatric patients.

A comparison between survival in EPAC-diagnosed VOD and patients post-HSCT without VOD in a 
publication from 2003 is not considered valuable, given that EPAC-diagnosed subjects were indeed 
considered to have VOC by the EPAC and that there are considerable differences in treatment 
regimens used for conditioning as well as regarding the populations eligible for HSCT between 
contemporary care as compared to older data. 
MAH response to 1b, mortality data: 
All, except one, participants who were diagnosed by the PI with VOD in both randomized treatment 
arms of the study (defibrotide prophylaxis [DP] and best supportive care [BSC]) received defibrotide 
rescue treatment. One participant, in the BSC arm withdrew from the study on the date of VOD 
diagnosis and did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment (Participant ID 8108-1002). As noted by the 
Agency and acknowledged in the background section above, a seemingly higher mortality rate was 
observed in participants who were randomized to the DP arm versus those randomized to the BSC 
arm, as reported in the final CSR for non-relapse mortality (NRM) and TEAEs leading to death in the 
rescue phase (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 5.1.2.4 and Section 5.2.1.4). Contributing 
factors for the observed imbalance are as follows: 
• Per the study electronic case report form (eCRF) completion guidelines, detailed reporting on the 
cause of death was not mandatory. 
• The definition of NRM used in the final analysis of the study (Module 5.5.3.4/JZP 15-007 CSR/Section 
3.7.1) did not include non-malignant relapse/disease progression. This introduced a biased estimate of 
NRM. 
• Not all causes of death were reported as adverse events (AEs) or were considered treatment 
emergent; for example, not all cases of VOD were reported as a TEAE since VOD was an endpoint in 
the study. 
The MAH has now investigated all causes of death that were reported on all relevant eCRFs, including 
Grade 5 (fatal) AEs and pharmacovigilance reporting (captured in the MAH safety database) and has 
prepared an additional listing of all deaths (any cause) post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the 
rescue phase of the study (HSCT) (Listing 1.2a). Individual participant narratives describing all deaths 
are provided in Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 11. 
Per the Agency’s request, an additional analysis was completed to provide incidence of death, for 
participants with PI-diagnosed VOD who received defibrotide rescue treatment, by randomized 
treatment arm (ie, randomized prior to the prophylaxis phase) and by age group (Table 4). However, 
please note that treatment arms/groups defined by post-randomization occurrence of VOD are not 
randomized groups, and hence, may not be comparable with respect to baseline prognostic 
characteristics nor in the severity of VOD (please refer to Q1a). 
In total, 27 participants died during the rescue phase of the study. Of the 27 deaths, the number of 
participants who died by the randomized treatment arm is similar: 14 deaths among those randomized 
to the DP arm and 13 deaths among those randomized to BSC arm. 
Per the safety analysis of fatal TEAEs presented in the CSR, during the rescue phase, 12 participants in 
the DP arm and 8 participants in the BSC arm experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to death (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 16). However, as shown in Table 4 and Listing 1.2a, there were 
additional deaths compared to the summary of TEAEs leading to death in the CSR final analysis. These 
fatal TEAEs were not included in the final analysis, as the fatal events were outside the study reporting

period. This has resulted in the imbalance observed in the final CSR while, in fact, there were no 
differences in the number of deaths between the treatment arms in the study. 
Among the 12 pediatric participants in the rescue phase who died, 7 participants were in the DP arm 
and 5 participants in the BSC. However an equal number of pediatric participants by treatment arm 
died due to TEAEs: n=5, DP arm and n=5, BSC arm (Listing 1.2a). The additional 2 participants in the 
DP arm who died during the rescue phase both died due to disease progression/disease relapse. 
In the rescue phase, causes of death among the 5 pediatric participants who died due to TEAEs in the 
DP arm were: cardiac arrest (n=1), multiple organ failure (MOF) and VOD (n=1), pseudomonal sepsis 
(n=1), MOF and candida sepsis (n=1), and intracranial haemorrhage (n=1) (Listing 1.2a). Of these, 
the TEAE of intracranial haemorrhage was the only TEAE leading to death reported by the PI as related 
to defibrotide treatment (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Listing 16.2.10.5). This participant (Patient 
ID 1603-1004), with the intracranial hemorrhage had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with severe 
thrombocytopenia prior to VOD diagnosis and the start of defibrotide rescue treatment; in addition, 
this participant was receiving heparin as a concomitant medication. These factors are all associated 
with increased risk of bleeding. 
In the rescue phase, causes of death among the 5 pediatric participants in the BSC arm were: brain 
death (n=1), respiratory failure (n=1), chronic respiratory failure/ microangiopathy/ pulmonary 
haemorrhage (n=1), adenoviral infection (n=1) and sepsis (n=1). 
Of the 15 adult participants who died in the rescue phase in the study, a similar number of participants 
were randomized to the DP arm (n=7) and the BSC arm (n=8) (Table 4). For the adult participants in 
the DP arm who died, causes of death were reported as infection (sepsis; n=4) – one of whom also 
had VOD, VOD was given as cause of death for 2 additional participants, and 1 participant died of 
leukoencephalopathy. Causes of death among adult participants in the BSC arm were similar to those 
in the DP arm: VOD (n=2), sepsis (n=1), pneumonia (n=2), device infection (n=1), MOF (n=1) and 
respiratory failure (n=1). 
Relevant clinical findings: The following clinical findings for participants in the DP arm who died in the 
rescue phase compared to the participants in BSC arm who died in the rescue phase are of relevance 
as these are known poor prognostic factors associated with poor outcome and increased mortality

(Listing 1.4). Despite this difference, a similar number of participants died in either treatment arm of 
the study: 
• Participants in the DP arm who died had more recurrent disease (≥ 2 recurrence, n = 8), indicating 
refractory/resistant disease versus participants in the BSC arm (≥ 2 recurrence, n = 2) 
• The 2 participants in the DP arm who had disease progression/disease relapse had associated risks 
including participant age, primary diseases, and Asian race, which are recognized as high risk for 
recurrence and poor outcome (Carreras, 2019): Participant ID 3905-1007, a 2-year-old with advanced 
stage neuroblastoma; Participant ID 6102-1008, a 4-year-old Asian with familial hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). 
• A higher number of graft manipulation and T-cell depletion among participants who died in the DP 
arm (n=6) versus those in the BSC arm (n=2). T-cell depletion is associated with primary disease 
relapse (Carreras, 2019). 
• Delay in defibrotide administration. One pediatric participant in each treatment arm had a primary 
disease of osteopetrosis. However, the participant in the DP arm was less than 1 month of age at study 
entry, and defibrotide administration was delayed until the participant became eligible (> 1 month). 
Delay in defibrotide administration combined with participant age is considered likely to have 
contributed to the adverse outcome in this participant (Richardson, 2017; Carreras, 2019; Parikh 
2019). 
Overall, a similar number of participants died during the rescue phase of the study regardless of 
randomized treatment arm (ie, randomized prior to the prophylaxis phase) and regardless of age 
subgroup. An equal number of pediatric participants died in each treatment arm due to non-relapse 
causes. Two pediatric participants in the DP arm died due to relapse/progression of primary disease. A 
similar number of adult participants died during the rescue phase due to NRM, regardless of 
randomized treatment arm. Given the evidence above, there is no increase in mortality reported in the 
DP arm compared with the BSC arm in the rescue phase and causes of death are similar for both 
treatment arms. In Study 15-007, mortality rates reflect those anticipated in this patient population 
undergoing HSCT (Richardson, 2016; Styczyński, 2019).

Assessor's comment: 
Non-relapse mortality was a secondary endpoint of study 15-007 and was defined as death that 
occurs after HSCT in participants who were noted as having malignant primary disease on the 
disease history eCRF and who did not have primary disease relapse post-HSCT. Only participants 
with malignant primary disease at baseline were included in the analysis. As discussed in previous 
rounds, some caution is warranted given that the primary endpoint was not met; however, a cause 
of concern was the numerical imbalance in non-relapse mortality between participants in the 
defibrotide arm and the best supportive care arm. Of the participants with malignant primary 
disease history, 22 of 147 participants (15.0%) in the DP arm and 11 of 139 participants (7.9%) in 
the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +100 post-HSCT. Of the participants with malignant primary 
disease history, 25 of 147 participants (17.0%) in the DP arm and 16 of 139 participants (11.5%) in 
the BSC arm experienced NRM by Day +180 post-HSCT. 
Although it is reassuring that there was no difference in overall mortality between initial 
(randomised) treatment groups during the ‘rescue phase’, the discussion on prevalence of risk 
factors for poor prognosis among those who actually died is of little relevance; rather, a discussion 
on risk factors for poor outcome for the respective entire treatment groups could have been of 
value. The clear numerical difference in non-relapse mortality between patients initially randomised 
to defibrotide as compared to those initially randomised to best supportive care is considered to 
further substantiates that the benefit-risk of defibrotide for prophylaxis of VOD is negative. 
MAH response to 1c, mortality during prophylaxis and treatment of VOD: 
In the final study analysis of Study 15-007, a seemingly higher mortality rate was observed in 
participants who were randomized to the DP arm versus those randomized to the BSC arm 
(randomization was prior to the prophylaxis phase) — data that were reported in the final CSR for non-
relapse mortality (NRM) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to death in the 
rescue phase (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 5.1.2.4 and Section 5.2.1.4). The MAH has 
performed an in-depth investigation of the study data, as was described in the responses to major 
objection Q1a and Q1b and substantiated that mortality results for participants by the randomized 
treatment arms are, in fact, comparable. 
By investigating the safety data in greater detail, the MAH concludes that no new safety signal was 
observed in this study with the safety results being comparable between the study treatment arms. 
Safety data from Study 15-007 are consistent with the known refence safety information of 
defibrotide. The MAH highlights that several factors have contributed to a misrepresentation of data 
leading to a numerical mortality imbalance presented in the final CSR. 
• Study 15-007 was powered to detect a difference in prevention of VOD with DP in addition to BSC 
compared to BSC alone; it was not designed to detect a difference between treatment arms in the 
treatment of VOD during the rescue phase. 
• The definition of NRM used in the final analysis of the study (Module 5.5.3.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 
3.7.1) did not include non-malignant relapse/disease progression. This introduced a biased estimate of 
NRM (refer to Q1b and see below). 
• The final analyses of the study were based on specific fields in the eCRF with limited allowance for 
cross-form capturing of data. This has resulted in unforeseen incomplete or missing follow-up data in 
the final analysis, despite the data being available via other study capturing methods (eg, VOD 
resolution, disease relapse, and fatal events/causes of death).

• Randomization to the DP arm versus BSC arm occurred once – at the start of the prophylaxis phase. 
Results from this study phase provide interpretable comparisons and are presented below. Therefore, 
any subgroups that resulted post-VOD diagnosis in the rescue phase (ie, post-randomization) are not 
valid comparators and violate the principle of randomization. 
The MAH reviewed the study data in more detail, including additional analyses presented in the 
responses to Q1a and Q1b, and concluded that the safety results from Study 15-007 are similar 
between the randomized treatment arms. No new safety signals are observed, and the results are 
consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide. This conclusion is consistent with that of the 
independent study Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) who reviewed the safety data at regular 
intervals (every 6 months), including at the interim and the final analysis of the study. While utilization 
of a central blinded adjudication for study efficacy endpoints is generally preferred versus treating 
physician/Principal Investigator (PI) assessment to alleviate potential bias, the method used and 
misalignment between the local and central assessment highly impact interpretation of the results. The 
study was designed with best knowledge at the time and following recommendations, but in 
retrospect, a deep evaluation of the study data have highlighted the consequences for how the study 
was conducted and ultimately analyzed. Further, this underscores the complexity around VOD 
diagnosis and therapy. Available evidence on central adjudication versus local PI assessment has 
shown high variability and has largely been dependent on the methods used, parameters used for 
adjudication, design of the study, and the clinical endpoints (Ford, 2016). 
Modified Seattle Criteria (MSC) was used in Study 15-007 for VOD assessment by both the EPAC and 
the PI. MSC is highly sensitive but has low specificity (Volin, 2016) and has high limitations in 
assessing severity of VOD, for which defibrotide is approved. EPAC VOD assessment was conducted 
from electronic review of participants’ data, remotely (outside the clinic) and in a retrospective manner 
(ie, not “real time”), while the PI had the advantage of close and continuous monitoring of participants 
in real time and with participants whom they likely had a clinical history. The decision to administer 
defibrotide rescue treatment was at the discretion of the PI, as was the assessment of VOD resolution, 
and management of TEAEs. EPAC had no influence on defibrotide rescue treatment nor on the 
assessment of VOD resolution. 
Furthermore, VOD diagnosis has been shown to be best addressed by a multidisciplinary approach and 
is highly-dependent on expert clinical judgement given the variable differential diagnosis of post-
transplant complications sharing similar non-specific clinical signs and symptoms (Volin, 2016). In 
examining the adjudication process, while a model of 2+1 (a recommended process [Ford, 2016]), was 
used in this study, there appears to be significant discrepancies between the adjudicators in their 
diagnosis of VOD (described in the response to Q1a). This resulted in several rounds of adjudication for 
a significant number of participants. In addition, the criteria that EPAC reported in their final diagnoses 
appear to have been based solely on the 4 criteria from MSC (bilirubin, weight, hepatomegaly and 
ascites), with the majority of diagnoses being based on hepatomegaly and ascites or weight (see Q1a). 
EPAC provided no description or discussion with respect to baseline characteristics (eg, primary 
disease, age, race) or other clinical conditions, which may have been risk factors of the participants 
and/or indicate potential diagnosis other than VOD. 
Given the substantive discrepancy between PI and EPAC diagnosis of VOD (refer to response Q2), 
analyses based on EPAC assessment of VOD likely provide distorted results. The participant subgroups 
derived from EPAC assessment of VOD (those treated or not treated with defibrotide) are not 
appropriate nor valid for comparison. After careful evaluation of the study data, the MAH would like to 
highlight that participants diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only and who did not receive defibrotide 
rescue treatment are highly unlikely to have experienced clinical VOD (please refer to Q1a). Indeed, 
the following evidence indicate that EPAC-only VOD diagnosis not treated with defibrotide rescue are

unlikely true VOD: The criteria EPAC used in substantiating the VOD diagnosis in these participants; 
the difference in major baseline prognostic factors presented in Q1a/Table 2; the similar survival rate 
at Day +100 post-HSCT for the subgroup diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only and not treated with 
defibrotide with the subgroup of participants not diagnosed with VOD and survival in non-VOD patients 
from published literature (Baker, 2003) strongly indicate that this subgroup diagnosed with VOD by 
EPAC only were likely not true clinical VOD. Given the above, it is clear that using EPAC diagnosis of 
VOD was not optimal for the primary endpoint in the design of study 15-007. 
The final analysis of Study 15-007, based on a total of 372 randomized participants (pediatric n=198, 
adults n=174), showed that the safety data between the 2 treatment arms (DP arm and BSC arm) of 
the study were similar (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 5.2). Overall, there were 65 deaths by 
the end of the study (Day +180 post-HSCT) (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 19): DP arm, n=35 
and BSC arm, n=30. 
Mortality in the rescue phase, as presented in response to Q1b, was similar between the 2 treatment 
arms: for the overall safety population (DP arm, n=14 versus BSC arm, n=13), as well as in both 
pediatric (DP arm, n=7 and BSC arm, n=5) and adult participants (DP arm, n=7 and BSC arm, n=8) 
(Table 4). In fact, an equal number of pediatric participants died in the DP arm (n=5) versus BSC arm 
(n=5) during the rescue phase due to causes other than relapse/disease progression. The 2 additional 
deaths in the DP arm were due to primary disease relapse (Q1b) and had not been highlighted as such 
in the final analyses, hence resulted in a seeming imbalance in the NRM (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Section 5.1.2.4) and the TEAEs leading to death (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 16). 
Primary disease relapse is a common finding in both clinical practice and published studies as a cause 
of death early post-transplantation (Styczyński, 2020). Fatal TEAEs assessed by the PI as related to 
defibrotide were reported in 2 participants, both during the rescue phase of the study (DP arm, n=1 
[intracranial hemorrhage] and BCS arm, n=1 [VOD]) (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 
5.2.1.4). 
Similarly, mortality in the prophylaxis phase (NB up to Day +180 post-HSCT for those who did not 
develop investigator-diagnosed VOD, Assessor’s comment) of the study (total n=38) was similar 
between the randomized treatment arms: DP arm, n=21 and BSC arm, n=17 (Listing 1.3a). Of these, 
15/38 were due to primary disease relapse: DP arm, n=8 and BSC arm, n=7. In the prophylaxis phase 
of Study 15-007, of the participants with NRM (23/38 [DP arm, n=13; BSC arm, n=10]), 4 pediatric 
participants in the DP arm died compared to 4 pediatric participants in the BSC arm. Therefore, the 
slight imbalance in mortality observed within the prophylaxis phase of the study is with respect to the 
adult participants (DP arm, n=9; BSC arm, n=7). Causes of mortality are provided in the listing on 
causes of death during the prophylaxis phase provided for this response submission (Listings 1.3a). 
Causes of death were consistent with transplant-related TEAEs that are commonly reported for 
patients undergoing transplant (Styczyński, 2020). 
Indeed, based on the detailed information provided above and in Q1b, combining the mortality in the 
prophylaxis and the rescue phase in Study 15-007, NMR was similar between the randomized 
treatment arms: DP arm, n=25 and BSC arm, n=23. Therefore, no imbalance in mortality is observed 
in Study 15-007 for either the prophylaxis and rescue phases of the study, nor for pediatric or adult 
participants. 
As presented in response to Q1a, the estimated survival at Day +100 post-HSCT of 54.7% (in cases 
diagnosed with VOD by both EPAC and PI who received defibrotide rescue treatment) and 59.6% 
based on PI VOD assessment (all of whom received defibrotide rescue treatment) (Table 14.2.6.1.7a) 
are consistent with the known survival rates following defibrotide treatment of VOD reported in 
previous studies during the clinical development program of defibrotide (Richardson, 2016; Kernan, 
2018; Richardson 2010), and real-world data from post marketing registries (Module 5.3.6/EBMT 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 159/194 
 
 
 
Registry CSR, Module 5.3.5.4/CIBMTR 2021 CSR, and Module 5.3.5.2/DEFIFrance CSR). As expected, 
in study 15-007, the estimated survival at Day +100 Post HSCT was noticeably higher in the non-VOD 
subgroup of participants (no VOD diagnosis by EPAC nor PI) and was similar to the Day +100 post 
HSCT survival in the subgroup diagnosed with VOD by EPAC (who did not receive defibrotide rescue 
treatment) and HSCT patients who develop no VOD in published literature. This strongly suggest that 
EPAC-only VOD diagnosis does not represent a true clinical VOD. Therefore, the requested survival 
comparison of participants in this study who developed VOD (EPAC assessment) and who received and 
did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment is neither statistically nor clinically valid. These groups 
were not randomized and have only resulted due to differences in VOD diagnosis between EPAC and 
PI. As described in Q1a, there are substantial differences in prognostic characteristics and VOD events; 
the 2 groups are not appropriate comparators. Furthermore, the high disagreement among the EPAC 
adjudicators, the multiple rounds of assessment, and the criteria on which VOD was diagnosed, in 
addition to the substantial differences in clinically-relevant VOD risk factors observed (Q1a/Table 2) 
between the EPAC-only VOD diagnoses and the PI diagnosed VOD are all indicative that VOD 
diagnosed by EPAC only who did not receive defibrotide rescue are not true clinical VODs, or at most 
mild VODs that did not require defibrotide rescue treatment based on the PI judgment. As such, the 
EPAC-only VOD group is not a valid comparator for survival analysis as requested by the agency. 
Several studies have previously shown the benefit of defibrotide in prophylaxis of VOD versus standard 
of care (Corbacioglu, 2012; Chalandon, 2004; Zhang, 2012). The largest study, the pediatric 
prophylaxis Study 2004 (Corbacioglu 2012) was the basis for Study 15-007. Study 2004 was a phase 
3, multicenter randomized study for prevention of VOD using defibrotide versus standard of care 
(control) in high-risk pediatric patients undergoing HSCT (Module 5.3.5.1/Study 2004 CSR). The study 
was conducted in 28 European study centers and included 356 participants (Safety Analysis Set 
N=353: DP arm, n=177, control arm, n=176). In Study 2004, overall, 32 (18%) participants in the 
defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm, and 29 (16%) participants in the control arm had an AE leading to 
death. Of these, 24 participants in each arm (DP arm, 13% and control arm, 14%) died before day 
+180 (Module 5.3.5.1/Study 2004 CSR/Section 12.3.1.1). For all 48 participants (24 in each arm), 
causes of death included Neoplasms, Malignant and Unspecified (7% and 8% of participants died due 
to recurrent malignancy, respectively); Infections and Infestations (3% and 6% of participants died 
due to sepsis or infection, respectively). One death due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage was reported 
for each treatment arm (possibly related to defibrotide for Participant LZ01SEP2004F285 randomized 
to DP arm; not related for Participant GF27MAY2001M285 randomized to the control arm without 
having received defibrotide). In addition, Participant LZ01SEP2004F285 in the DP arm who 
experienced gastrointestinal haemorrhage, also experienced 2 additional unrelated AEs with outcome 
of death, including candida sepsis and liver disease. All participants in Study 2004 who developed 
VOD, regardless of treatment arm, received defibrotide treatment per study protocol. During the VOD 
treatment phase, 5/24 (21%) participants in the DP arm and 11/36 (31%) participants in the control 
arm experienced at least 1 TEAE with an outcome of death (Module 5.3.5.1/Study 2004/Table 36). In 
the DP arm, 1 participant died of disease progression, multiorgan failure (n=2), cardiac arrest (n=1) 
and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (n=1). In the control arm, fatal TEAEs in more than 1 participant 
during VOD treatment with defibrotide included sepsis (n=3), multiorgan failure (n=2), disease 
progression (n=2), respiratory failure (n=1), and veno-occlusive liver disease (n=1), and hepatobiliary 
disease (n=2). Given the above, the 2 treatment arms in Study 2004 were generally similar with 
respect to AEs leading to death. Only 1 participant randomized to the DP arm reported a drug-related 
serious adverse event (SAE) while receiving defibrotide for prophylaxis (gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
occurring in a participant with multiple other co-existing SAE/AEs leading to death). A similar AE 
(gastrointestinal haemorrhage leading to death was experienced by a participant in the control arm 
without receiving defibrotide prophylaxis or rescue treatment. In summary, study 15-007 data and 
data from Study 2004 do not support a detrimental effect of defibrotide on mortality.

A number of adult patients have been included in previous studies evaluating the efficacy of defibrotide 
in prevention of VOD in pediatric and adult patients (Chalandon 2004, Zhang 2012). No safety 
concerns with respect to defibrotide or increase in mortality have been reported in any of these 
studies. A more recent pooled analysis was conducted using 10 studies, totaling >1000 participants, 
that evaluated defibrotide for VOD prophylaxis (Corbacioglu 2020). In this meta-analysis, the overall 
VOD/SOS incidence following administration of defibrotide was 5% (5% in adults and 8% in pediatric 
patients). Of the 10 studies, 8 studies evaluated IV defibrotide prophylaxis versus controls (eg, 
heparin, no prophylaxis), VOD/SOS incidence in controls was 16%. The risk ratio for developing 
VOD/SOS with defibrotide prophylaxis versus controls was 0.30 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12, 
0.71; p=0·0002). No new safety concerns were reported in these studies. 
The efficacy and safety of defibrotide in treatment of VOD have been extensively evaluated through 
the clinical development program over the last 20 years including approximately 2000 patients with 
VOD in multiple clinical trials and expanded access/compassionate use programs. In addition, 
defibrotide uses in clinical practice with > 15,000 patients treated with defibrotide post approval 
globally (Module 5.3.6/2020 PBRER) provides further evidence of the favorable safety profile of 
defibrotide in the currently-approved indication. Hepatic VOD remains a serious and life-threatening 
condition for thousands of patients in the world that if left untreated or sub-optimally treated can 
rapidly progress to multiple organ dysfunction and death (Coppell 2010). There is still a substantial 
unmet medical need to better manage patients with this condition. Defibrotide in the approved 
indication is well established in treatment of severe hepatic VOD. Efficacy of defibrotide was further 
supported with results from the pooled analysis of available evidence on defibrotide efficacy studies in 
the treatment of patients with VOD, including 17 studies representing 2598 patients. From this meta-
analysis, survival rates at Day +100 were estimated at 54% pooled across all doses of defibrotide, and 
56% in the approved dose of 25 mg/kg/day, which included n=2073 from 10 of the 17 studies 
(EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0043, June 2019). This represents comprehensive evidence on the efficacy and 
safety of defibrotide in the treatment of VOD, a potentially fatal condition post-HSCT, with a mortality 
>80% if left untreated (Coppell 2010). Estimated survival at Day +100 post-HSCT of 59.6% in 
participants who developed VOD and were treated with defibrotide rescue treatment (Table 
14.2.6.1.7a) in Study 15-007 is consistent with results from previous studies and the above-described 
pooled analysis. No new safety concern has been raised from reported studies to date. The recently 
completed phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy of defibrotide in the prevention of acute GvHD 
included 152 adults and pediatric patients has shown similar safety data between defibrotide 
prophylaxis versus standard of care (Module 5.3.5.1/JZP963-201 CSR). Safety data in this additional 
randomized study on defibrotide were consistent with the safety profile of defibrotide. Furthermore, it 
is worth noting that defibrotide has been available since the 1980's and has been used in thousands of 
patients globally. No new safety signals have been raised from multiple use both in previous 
indications and currently. 
In summary, Study 15-007 provided additional safety data on defibrotide in a randomized setting, to 
fulfil the EMA-required Specific Obligation on safety. Overall mortality is similar by the randomized 
treatment arms, in both the prophylaxis and rescue phase and by age group in the study. The safety 
results from this study are consistent with the defibrotide safety profile in treatment of VOD and 
evidence from earlier prevention and treatment studies in both pediatrics and adults. Comparison of 
the efficacy of defibrotide in the treatment of VOD in Study 15-007 is not appropriate. The group of 
participants who were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only and did not receive defibrotide rescue 
treatment either did not have clinical VOD or had only very mild VOD for whom defibrotide rescue was 
deemed unnecessary per PI assessment; therefore, not appropriate or valid to compare with clinically-
established severe form of VOD diagnosed by the PI and who received defibrotide rescue. These 
subgroups defined by post-randomization occurrence of VOD are not randomized groups and hence not

comparable in the severity of VOD and prognostic characteristics. Caution should be exercised when 
comparing subgroups that were not prespecified nor anticipated from the study design.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Differences in outcome between EPAC-adjudicated cases of VOD and investigator-assessed cases of 
VOD 
The external blinded endpoint adjudication committee (EPAC) is considered a clear strength of study 
15-007, given the open-label study design, the severity of underlying disease in the study population, 
the need of stringency in establishing the diagnosis of VOD and and the difficulties in assessing other 
clinical data on use of defibrotide. The EPAC was provided with clinical data to assess whether VOD 
occurred or not. It is fully agreed that establishing the diagnosis of VOD could be difficult. The 
limitations with the modified Seattle criteria are also well known. Nevertheless, for study 15-007, both 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 162/194 
 
 
 
the EPAC and the principal investigators appear to have had access to similar clinical data and utilised 
the same criteria for diagnosis. There appears to be no actual clinical data of importance for the 
diagnostic process that were taken into account by investigators but not provided to the EPAC. Thus, 
the discordance between investigators and the EPAC may not only be accounted for by the investigator 
being close to the patient, but also by an underlying bias resulting from investigators being non-
blinded to study treatment. Notably, the authorisation of defibrotide relied on clinical data from one 
open-label pivotal trial with a historical control group for which VOD was retrospectively assessed. 
Therefore, the MAH argumentation warrants some caution regarding any lack of robustness of 
retrospective, remote assessment of VOD. 
The overall mortality among those who received defibrotide as rescue treatment was higher as 
compared to those who were diagnosed by the EPAC only (and were not treated with defibrotide); 
11/61 or 18% of EPAC-only diagnosed subjects died as compared to 23/43 or 53.5% of those who 
were diagnosed by both EPAC and investigators (and were treated with defibrotide). A key question is 
if any clinical differences were reported at the time of diagnosis between those diagnosed by 
investigators and those diagnosed by the EPAC but not by investigators. No such comprehensive 
discussion has been provided; rather, the discussion provided pertains to differences in risk factors for 
VOD, which may not translate into differences in severity if VOD actually occurs, and a difference in 
the proportion of cases with elevated bilirubin: 
For risk factors for VOD at baseline, some differences are noted between those with a VOD diagnosis 
by the EPAC and those diagnosed by investigators only. However, several well recognised risk factors 
have not been included among the presented data, such as (degree of) liver disease, pulmonary 
function and underlying disease (ie cause of HSCT). Unrelated donors appear more frequent among 
those diagnosed by the EPAC only, whereas myeloablative conditioning was more frequent among 
those who received defibrotide as rescue treatment (including busulfan and fludarabine conditioning). 
More than half of patients in both groups had a ‘very high risk’ of VOD, 27/43 or 62.8% among those 
diagnosed by investigators and 32/61 or 52.5% of those diagnosed by the EPAC. Nevertheless, the 
relevance of these data to support whether subjects actually had VOD or not is unclear. 
The extensive argumentation on why EPAD-diagnosed subjects with VOD actually did not actually have 
VOD is noted; notably, this could question the entire study design given that the primary endpoint was 
EPAC-adjudicated VOD. It is argued that among EPAC-adjudicated cases of VOD, a differential 
diagnosis or causal factor was often more likely than actual VOD, examples including preparative 
regimen, chemotherapy, pre-existing liver disease, underlying malignancy, or temporary condition 
such as volume overload. However, these factors are well known risk factors and/or symptoms of VOD 
and thus, the argumentation is somewhat difficult to follow. The only clinical factor that is described to 
differ between subjects diagnosed as VOD by both investigators and the EPAC, and those diagnosed by 
the EPAC only, is elevation of bilirubin; notably, however, subjects diagnosed only by investigators 
were older (median age 17 years; Table 1 above) than EPAC-diagnosed subjects (median age 10 
years); anicteric VOD is well known to be more frequent among paediatric patients. Further, according 
to the protocol, defibrotide was used for treatment of VOD regardless of severity with VOD diagnosis 
as per the modified Seattle criteria in either the DP or BSC arms. Thus, it appears that defibrotide was 
not only to be used in cases of severe VOD (labelled indication) but for any VOD that developed as per 
investigators assessment. 
A comparison between survival in EPAC-diagnosed VOD and patients post-HSCT without VOD in a 
publication from 2003 is not considered of limited value, given that EPAC-diagnosed subjects appear to 
have fulfilled the modified Seattle criteria and that there are considerable differences in treatment 
regimens used for conditioning as well as regarding the populations eligible for HSCT between 
contemporary care as compared to older data.

Mortality 
Non-relapse mortality was a secondary endpoint of study 15-007 and was defined as death that occurs 
after HSCT in participants who were noted as having malignant primary disease on the disease history 
eCRF and who did not have primary disease relapse post-HSCT. Only participants with malignant 
primary disease at baseline were included in the analysis. As discussed in previous rounds, some 
caution is warranted given that the primary endpoint was not met; however, a cause of concern was 
the numerical imbalance in non-relapse mortality between participants in the defibrotide arm and the 
best supportive care arm. Of the participants with malignant primary disease history, 22 of 147 
participants (15.0%) in the DP arm and 11 of 139 participants (7.9%) in the BSC arm experienced 
NRM by Day +100 post-HSCT. Of the participants with malignant primary disease history, 25 of 147 
participants (17.0%) in the DP arm and 16 of 139 participants (11.5%) in the BSC arm experienced 
NRM by Day +180 post-HSCT. The vast majority of subjects had malignant disease as reason for their 
HSCT, and study deaths related to relapse or progression of malignant disease may be considered 
more likely not related to any study treatment as compared to non-malignant disease. 
Despite the differences in NRM, it is however reassuring that there was no difference in overall 
mortality between the initial randomised treatment groups during the ‘rescue phase’. The discussion on 
prevalence of risk factors for poor prognosis among those who actually died is not clearly relevant; 
rather, a discussion on risk factors for poor outcome for the respective entire treatment groups could 
have been more valuable. Notably, the treatment groups were balanced with regards to underlying 
disease. The numerical difference in non-relapse mortality between patients initially randomised to 
defibrotide-prophylaxis as compared to those initially randomised to best supportive care is considered 
to further substantiate that the benefit-risk of defibrotide for prophylaxis of VOD is negative. 
A recent meta-analysis/systematic review on defibrotide prophylaxis of VOD is referred (Corbacioglu 
2020), funded by the MAH and provided as a conference poster. Among the defibrotide prophylaxis 
studies included, the only new randomised controlled study included was Kikuta 2018, in which 50 
patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning before allogenic HSCT were randomised to open-label 
defibrotide (N=33) or SoC (N =17). VOD/SOS occurred by day +30 post
HSCT in 1 (3.1%) patient in 
the defibrotide prophylaxis group vs no (0%) patients in the control group. Serious adverse events 
‐
were reported in 8 (24.2%) patients in the defibrotide group and 2 (11.8%) were reported in control.  
During the MA assessment and re-examination procedure, the data on prophylaxis (primarily the 
randomised study 2004) were not considered to support a relevant efficacy based also on the study 
design (open-label, investigator-based diagnosis of VOD). For safety, it was pointed out that the death 
rate was higher in the prevention study when children who did not develop VOD and received 
defibrotide were compared with subjects in the control arm who did not develop VOD still remained 
unexplained. Overall in the prevention trial a higher death rate of 25 (17%) in the defibrotide arm 
compared with 18 (13%) in the control arm was noted. Although most deaths occurred more than 1 
month after cessation of defibrotide, in 7 cases AEs related to the death occurred during treatment 
with defibrotide or within one week of stopping defibrotide. 
In conclusion, the requested data have been provided. Patients diagnosed as VOD by the EPAC only, 
and not receiving ‘rescue treatment’ with defibrotide had a clearly more favourable outcome regarding 
mortality. The MAH argumentation that those diagnosed by the EPAC actually did not have VOD, or 
had very mild VOD, is not considered adequately supported by clinical data. Thus, no firm conclusions 
can be drawn, and it is not likely that additional analyses could be of value. Notably, however, the 
discordance between investigators and the EPAC may not only be accounted for by the investigator 
being close to the patient, as argued by the MAH, but also by an underlying bias resulting from 
investigators being non-blinded to study treatment.

The difference in mortality disfavouring defibrotide prophylaxis during the first 30 days post HSCT 
remains unexplained. In addition to the concerns on overall mortality in the previous randomised 
defibrotide prophylaxis study (study 2004), the higher proportion of non-relapse mortality among 
patients randomised to defibrotide-prophylaxis as compared to best supportive care in study 15-007, 
and the absence of effect on prevention of VOD in study 15-007, the benefit-risk of defibrotide for 
prophylaxis of VOD is clearly negative.

Efficacy 
Question 2. In table 4 in the response document, there are 96 events of VOD as assessed by the EPAC and 43 
events of VOD as assessed by investigators (38 + 3 + 2) by Day +100 post-HSCT. However, with a reference to 
listing 16.2.7.3, it is stated that there were 56 participants diagnosed with VOD by investigators by Day +100. The 
MAH should clarify why these 13 participants are not included in the description of concordance between EPAC and 
investigators as outlined in Response Table 4. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In the previously generated concordance analysis by Day +100 post-HSCT (Table 14.2.2.1.1), there 
are 31 participants in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set who were excluded from the 
analysis using the VOD-free survival censoring rules for the primary efficacy endpoint (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 8.8.6/Section 10.1). In one of those censoring rules, VOD-free 
survival is censored at the start of defibrotide rescue treatment. Out of these 31 participants, 13 were 
diagnosed with VOD by the Principal Investigator (PI) and started defibrotide rescue treatment, and 
therefore, were censored by this rule. The other 18 participants were censored for other reasons 
(EPAC-diagnosed VOD before HSCT [n=3] and death without VOD by Day +100 [n=15]). For the 
updated concordance analysis by Day +100 post-HSCT, these 31 subjects are included. 
Since the final analysis of Study 15-007 was done, the MAH implemented a revised standard for 
concordance analyses that aligns with current best practice for this type of time-to-event analysis in 
hematology/oncology clinical trials. Under the revised standard, concordance is defined for all 
participants in the mITT Analysis Set as agreement between the EPAC and the PI on the diagnosis of 
VOD (both yes or both no), and in the case that VOD is diagnosed, diagnosis dates within 3 days. The 
Agency is asked to refer to the revised concordance analyses provided in this response (Table 5 and 
Table 6) instead of the previous ones. The results from the revised concordance analysis have been 
used in the responses to the major objection, Question 1. 
The overall concordance between EPAC and PI diagnosis of VOD at Day +30 post-HSCT was 73.7% 
(Table 5). There was agreement that 233/353 participants (66%) did not have VOD and that 27/353 
(7.7%) did have VOD with diagnosis dates within 3 days. Another 10/353 participants (2.8%) were 
diagnosed with VOD by both EPAC and PI, but the diagnosis dates were more than 3 days apart. At 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 165/194 
 
 
 
Day +100 post-HSCT, the concordance rate was 51.6% (Table 6): 152/353 (43.1%) participants did 
not have VOD by EPAC and PI and 30/353 (8.5%) did have VOD with diagnosis dates within 3 days. 
To explain this decrease in the concordance rate between Day +30 and Day +100 post-HSCT, consider 
the change in EPAC assessment from Day +30 to Day +100. There were 85 participants who were 
assessed by the EPAC as not having VOD by Day +30 ('No') who were assessed as 'Not Evaluable' or 
'Yes' by EPAC at Day +100. Of the n=353 participants in the mITT Analysis Set, 14/353 (4.0%) had 
VOD assessed by EPAC as not having VOD by Day +30 and then as having VOD ('Yes') by Day +100 
and matched the PI assessment by Day +100. Therefore, 71/353 (20.1%) changed from 'No' by Day 
+30 to 'Not Evaluable' by Day +100. Those who were not evaluable by EPAC could not be concordant. 
Similarly, of the 353 participants in the mITT Analysis Set, 43/353 (12.2%) were diagnosed by both 
EPAC and PI at Day +100; 30/353 (8.5%) had diagnosis dates within 3 days and were concordant, but 
13/353 (3.7%) diagnosed by both EPAC and PI at Day +100 had dates that were more than 3 days 
part, further reducing the overall concordance rate.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has presented a revised analysis of the concordance between the EPAC and investigators 
diagnosis of VOD. The full rationale and extent of which the new analyses differ as compared to the 
previously presented ones are however unclear. It appears, however, that all subjects treated with 
defibrotide as ‘rescue treatment’ in line with being diagnosed with VOD by investigators are now 
included in the Table pertaining to the +100 Day post-HSCT. A further comment is that with the new 
analyses, there appears to be more subjects who were not evaluable by the EPAC at Day + 30 post-
HSCT  (N = 17) as compared to what was previously presented (N =13) which could have some 
relevance for the primary efficacy outcome assessment; however, the rationale for the 
reclassification/new analyses is unclear. Given the low absolute number, this issue is not pursued. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued.

Question 3. Data on VOD-resolution in subjects diagnosed with VOD during study 15-007 should be provided, 
divided by those who received defibrotide and those diagnosed with VOD who did not receive defibrotide, for the 
entire study population and divided by age groups (paediatric subjects vs adults). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In Study 15-007, an Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EPAC) was set up to provide independent, 
blinded, medical review and adjudication of VOD diagnosis for the analyses of the primary and key 
secondary endpoints in the study. EPAC-assessed VOD diagnosis was based on the Modified Seattle 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 167/194 
 
 
 
 
Criteria (MSC), per study protocol, and was performed from electronic review of participants’ data, 
remotely and retrospectively. The Principal Investigators (PIs) assessed individual participants for 
presence of VOD in real time based on MSC, per study protocol, and as part of the participants’ clinical 
care and management. Upon the diagnosis of VOD and when applicable, defibrotide rescue treatment 
was administered as per PI’s clinical judgement. Assessment of VOD resolution was also performed in 
real time by the PI and reported in the study electronic case report form (eCRF). Per EPAC charter, no 
data for assessment of VOD resolution was provided to EPAC. 
Per the study protocol, all participants diagnosed with VOD by the PI received defibrotide rescue 
treatment, except for 1 participant in the best supportive care (BSC) arm (Participant ID 8108-1002), 
who was diagnosed with VOD by the PI but did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment. This 
participant was withdrawn from Study 15-007 on the date of VOD diagnosis. Since assessment of VOD 
resolution was based on PI assessment only, data on VOD resolution (Yes/No) are available only for all 
participants who were diagnosed with VOD by the PI (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 5.1.2.6). 
Per the agency’s request, the MAH performed an additional analysis on VOD resolution in participants 
who were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC and received defibrotide rescue treatment (cases diagnosed by 
EPAC and PI with VOD, n=43) versus those who did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment 
(participants who were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only, n=61). Further, it is important to point out 
that an additional 13 participants were diagnosed with VOD by the PI, but not by EPAC, who received 
defibrotide treatment. Therefore, a total of 57 participants were diagnosed with VOD by PI, all of whom 
but one (Participant ID 8102-1008), received defibrotide rescue treatment (Figure 1). These 2 groups 
(VOD treated with defibrotide and not treated) were defined from the substantive discrepancy between 
the PI- and EPAC-assessment of VOD (see Q2) and represent groups that are invalid for comparison, 
as described in responses to Q1a and Q1c. An analysis comparing the 2 groups described above is 
invalid for the following reasons: 
• Participants with VOD diagnoses by EPAC and PI represent only a proportion (43/56 [76.8%]) of all 
VOD participants diagnosed by PI who received defibrotide rescue treatment and subsequently had 
assessment of VOD resolution (n=56), and hence the analysis is incomplete and invalid for 
interpretation. 
• The study was not designed to evaluate defibrotide in treatment of VOD. If the PI and EPAC 
diagnoses, including diagnosis dates, were fully concordant, the group of participants with VOD who 
were not treated with defibrotide rescue treatment would not have resulted. Exploration into the 
diagnosis discrepancy is described in the response to Q1a, which indicate that EPAC-only diagnosed 
VOD not treated with defibrotide rescue are not true clinical VODs. 
• VOD resolution data are not available for the participants diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only, and not 
deemed by the PI as needing rescue treatment; therefore, the requested comparison is not possible. 
These participants were not diagnosed with VOD by the PI, and it is highly unlikely that these 
participants diagnosed with VOD only by EPAC had experienced true clinical VOD (please refer to 
response to Q1a and discussion in Q1c). 
Both analyses (based on EPAC- or PI-diagnosis of VOD) are presented for the overall intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population and by age groups (pediatric participants [≤ 16 years old] and adult participants [> 16 
years]) as requested. 
For this analysis, the MAH has reviewed the study data in more detail, looking at all relevant data 
collected, as well as the individual participant safety narratives. The MAH would like to clarify the 
following: Some data on VOD resolution were missing from the data field on the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) that was utilized for the final report analysis. However, upon further investigation, VOD 
resolution was captured within a different eCRF page. To add more clarity on VOD resolution, all 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 168/194 
 
 
 
available and relevant data on VOD resolution as reported by the PI were captured to provide a 
complete picture for the participants with missing data (Listing 3.4). In Table 7 and Table 8 below, the 
analyses in the left column were done based on VOD resolution captured within a specific data field on 
the VOD assessment eCRF, hence include a number of participants with VOD resolution status missing. 
The tables also include an additional column to the right, presenting VOD resolution that includes 
additional information on VOD resolution from the participant safety narratives that was not properly 
captured in the VOD assessment eCRF. Listing 3.4 is provided for the participants who had VOD 
resolution changed based on available information from the narratives for clarity and reference. 
Post hoc analysis of VOD resolution of participants diagnosed with VOD based on EPAC assessment by 
those who received or did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment: A total of 43 participants were 
diagnosed with VOD by both EPAC and PI and received defibrotide rescue treatment: 21 pediatric 
participants and 22 adult participants. (Table 7). Overall, among these 43 participants VOD resolution 
was 28.0%. A higher VOD resolution was seen in pediatric participants (42.8%) versus adults 
(13.6%). Based on the additional information available (Table 7, right column), a higher VOD 
resolution is observed in the overall population at 44.2%; pediatrics 47.6% and adults 40.9% 
compared with the previous analysis with several incomplete fields for VOD resolution status. An 
additional 61 participants (34 pediatric and 27 adult) were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC did not 
receive defibrotide rescue treatment nor had assessment for VOD resolution, therefore 100% of these 
participants are presented as VOD resolution unknown. Additional substantial differences in VOD risk 
factors between this group (VOD diagnosed by EPAC only who did not receive defibrotide rescue 
treatment) and VOD diagnosed by EPAC and PI (who then received defibrotide rescue) were presented 
in Q1a/Table 2. As such and per the discussion in Q1a, it is likely that this group did not experience 
clinical VOD, hence is not an appropriate comparator group for those who did. Please note that one of 
the 61 participants was diagnosed with VOD by PI but was withdrawn from the study on the date of 
VOD diagnosis (Participant ID 8108-1002), hence did not receive defibrotide rescue treatment and 
therefore, was included in the participants not treated with defibrotide as rescue treatment in Table 7. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 169/194 
 
 
 
  
Post hoc analysis of VOD resolution in participants diagnosed with VOD based on PI assessment and 
who received defibrotide treatment: Of the 56 participants diagnosed with VOD by the PI, an equal 
proportion had VOD resolved (39.3%) and not resolved (39.3%); 21.4% had missing VOD resolution 
status (Table 8). A higher percentage of pediatric participants (53.3%) had VOD resolution compared 
with adult participants (23.1%). Evaluation of the analysis that includes the additional information on 
VOD resolution from missing status cases (Table 8, right column), showed among the 56 participants 
with VOD diagnoses by PI, 50.0% had VOD resolution and 50.0% did not. The higher resolution of 
VOD in pediatric participants (56.7%) was maintained versus adult participants (42.3%).

In summary, the additional investigation of VOD resolution, utilizing all relevant clinical and safety data 
collected and specifically, individual participant safety narratives, provides a more complete picture of 
VOD resolution. Regardless of VOD diagnosis by EPAC or PI, VOD resolution was higher for pediatric 
participants compared to adult participants following treatment with defibrotide. 
VOD resolution for participants who were diagnosed with VOD by EPAC only (and not the PI) is not 
available. Because this group was not diagnosed with VOD by PI, these participants did not receive 
defibrotide rescue treatment, nor did they have assessment of VOD resolution. The MAH would like to 
highlight that these participants either did not experience clinical VOD or at most may have had mild 
VOD cases that required no defibrotide rescue treatment, as assessed by the PI. Whereas, as 
described in response to Q1a, the participants with VOD diagnosed by the PI and treated with 
defibrotide were more definitive clinical cases of VOD with more advanced presentations (ie, the 
indication population per the Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]). These 2 groups are not 
valid comparators. 
Despite the discrepancy in EPAC and PI VOD diagnoses, results on VOD resolution in participants who 
received defibrotide rescue treatment are consistent with known efficacy of defibrotide (Defitelio SmPC 
2021). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH states that VOD resolution data are not available for the participants diagnosed with VOD by 
EPAC only, and thus, no comparison can be made. As discussed in the previous round, based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023

protocol, given the extensive follow-up of participants up to Day +180 post-HSCT according to the 
protocol, with weekly assessment of VOD and VOD-associated MOD up to day +60 post-HSCT, and at 
Day +100 post-HSCT and day +180 post-HSCT, it should likely be possible to assess whether patients 
diagnosed with VOD by the EPAC had VOD resolution during the course of the study. 
These data were requested given that this SOB also pertains to comparative safety data for 
defibrotide. If there is no difference on resolution of VOD in participants with VOD depending on 
treatment with defibrotide or not, then this is primarily a matter of lack of efficacy, which may not 
necessarily be a safety problem. However, if there was less resolution of VOD among those who 
received defibrotide for rescue treatment as compared to those who did not receive defibrotide for 
rescue treatment, then this is a potential safety problem. 
The Rapporteur however agrees that no such evaluation was prespecified in the protocol; it is assumed 
that the MAH has carefully reviewed these data without considering any safety issue to be found. This 
issue is not pursued. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 4. The immunogenicity data should be provided within this procedure  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Study 15-007 immunogenicity report has been provided, located in Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Immunogenicity Report): 
The MAH efforts to develop an assay to detect the formation of anti-defibrotide Anti-Drug Antibodies 
(ADA) in humans have been unsuccessful as per report 0058-17, titled “Generation and Purification of 
Polyclonal Antibodies against Defibrotide in Rabbits” (Appendix 1). Since a validated ADA assay could 
not be developed, the commercially available anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test, which can detect anti-
DNA antibodies, has been employed in lieu of the ADA assay and neutralizing antibodies assays to 
evaluate and characterize defibrotide immunogenicity potential, and its results are presented in the 
current report. 
In total 302 participants (out of 355 in the safety set) were included into the Immunogenicity Analysis 
Set, 157 in the defibrotide prophylaxis group and 145 in the best supportive care group; the weight 
restrictions limited the number of participants contributing to Immunogenicity Analysis Set. 
Of the 136 participants who received defibrotide as prophylaxis and did not develop investigator 
diagnosed VOD, none had positive baseline ANA results. Most participants in this group had negative 
post-baseline results through Day +180 post-HSCT, and only 1 participant had a single positive post-
baseline ANA result at Day +180 post-HSCT, measured as a low ANA titer (1:80). Of the 21 
participants who received defibrotide as prophylaxis but developed investigator diagnosed VOD and 
then also received defibrotide as a rescue treatment, none had positive baseline or post-baseline ANA 
results. Of the 118 participants who received BSC as prophylaxis and did not develop investigator 
diagnosed VOD, 1 participant had a positive baseline ANA result measured as a high ANA titer 
(1:2560). A limited number of participants in this group had their post-baseline samples analyzed, but 
none had positive post-baseline results. Of the 27 participants who received BSC as prophylaxis but 
developed investigator diagnosed VOD and then received defibrotide as a rescue treatment, none had 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 172/194 
 
 
 
 
positive baseline or post-baseline ANA results. These results indicate that defibrotide has a low 
immunogenicity risk in the studied population. There were no trends in ANA positive results or titer 
over the course of the study. There is no potential for predictive relationship between ANA status and 
clinical or safety measures of defibrotide.  
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
There is no assay to detect anti-defibrotide ADAs as it was not possible to generate a positive control. 
Instead, a commercially available anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test was employed, which is expected to 
be less specific to anti-defibrotide antibodies. As no positive control anti-defibrotide antibody is 
available, it is not possible to assess the adequacy of the ANA method either. There is no discussion on 
the immunogenicity findings in relation to the reports of hypersensitivity, and there is no further 
testing provided for those individuals who presented with ANA positivity. 
Conclusions 
Issue not further pursued. No conclusions on immunogenicity can be drawn due to the lack of a test 
to detect anti-defibrotide ADAs. 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 5. An analysis of subjects in study 15-007 who had pre-existing liver disease based on a defined 
medical condition of hepatic disorder at baseline should be provided. The safety profile should be discussed not only 
in relation to best supportive care but also in relation to the overall safety population. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Safety analyses using the requested definition of pre-existing liver disease were performed for the 
subset of participants with hepatic disorders at baseline. A participant was determined to have pre-
existing liver disease only if they had a medical condition at baseline within the broad Hepatic 
disorders standardized MedDRA query (SMQ). This included analyses for the overall Safety Analysis Set 
for Study 15-007 in the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) arm (N=181), as well as the pediatric (≤ 16 years 
old; n=99) and adult (> 16 years, n=82) subgroups in the DP arm. Of note, baseline was defined in 
the Study 15-007 protocol as the day before conditioning begins for participants in the DP arm, and on 
the day that conditioning begins for participants in the best supportive care (BSC) arm. 
The safety profile in participants (all ages) with pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm (n=59) was 
compared with those participants having pre-existing liver disease in the BSC arm (n=62), as well as 
those participants who did not have pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm (n=122). This latter 
analysis was performed to determine if there was any impact on the overall safety population (in 
participants who received defibrotide for prophylaxis). The most common types of pre-existing liver 
disease seen in the DP arm included alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased/aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased, hepatic enzyme increased, hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, and 
transaminases increased (3 participants each; Table 14.1.6a). The most common types of pre-existing 
liver disease in the BSC arm included hepatic function abnormal (5 participants), hepatic steatosis and 
transaminases increased (4 participants each), and hepatic enzyme increased, hepatomegaly, 
aspartate aminotransferase increased, and hepatitis B (3 participants each). 
The first portion of this response will describe the comparison of safety of defibrotide in participants 
with pre-existing liver disease across the 2 treatment arms (DP and BSC arms). The review will cover 
safety in the prophylaxis and rescue phases separately. The latter half of the response will evaluate the 
impact participants in the DP arm with pre-existing liver disease had on the overall safety population 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 173/194 
 
 
 
by comparing this group to participants in the DP arm without pre-existing liver disease. The review 
will cover safety in the prophylaxis and rescue phases separately. 
Comparison of Participants with Pre-existing Liver Disease by Treatment Arm – Prophylaxis Phase 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, a similar number of participants were identified as 
having pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm (n=59) and BSC arm (n=62). More pediatric 
participants (n=39) than adult participants (n=20) with pre-existing liver disease were randomized to 
the DP arm, and a similar number of pediatric and adult participants with pre-existing liver disease 
were randomized to the BSC arm (pediatric n=29; adult n=33). 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, the overall safety results in participants with pre-
existing liver disease were similar in the DP and the BSC arms. The frequencies of the most common 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; defined by occurrence in ≥ 15% of participants in either 
treatment arm) were generally similar in participants with pre-existing liver disease in the DP and BSC 
arms. 
In a tabulated summary (see Table 9 of response document), the Preferred Terms (PTs) that were 
reported with a ≥ 10% higher frequency in the DP arm compared with the BSC arm included abdominal 
pain, blood bilirubin increased, headache, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypomagnesaemia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and vomiting. The PTs that were reported by a ≥ 10% higher 
frequency in the BSC arm compared with the DP arm included hyperphosphataemia, insomnia, and 
neutrophil count decreased. 
A notable pattern in this analysis was the higher incidences of TEAEs by PTs associated with 
myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) for the participants with pre-existing 
liver disease in the DP arm compared with the BSC arm. This difference is partially offset by the higher 
incidences observed in the BSC arm for the equivalent PTs falling under the System Organ Class (SOC) 
of Investigations (neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased). A likely contributing factor 
to the higher rates of myelosuppression terms observed for these participants in the DP arm is the 
higher proportion of pediatric to adult participants in this subgroup and arm compared to the same 
subgroup in the BSC arm. There were approximately twice as many pediatric versus (vs) adult 
participants in the DP arm with pre-existing liver disease compared to a roughly equivalent number of 
pediatric to adult participants in the BSC arm with pre-existing liver disease. The safety analysis 
performed for the overall Safety Analysis Set showed the incidence of myelosuppressive terms were 
significantly higher in pediatric compared with adult participants in both treatment arms (Module 
5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.3.1.4). For example, in the overall safety population, a higher 
percentage of pediatric participants compared to adult participants reported febrile neutropenia 
(19.9% vs 8.8%, respectively in the DP arm; 19.5% vs 15.5%, respectively in the BSC arm), anaemia 
(16.0% vs 10.5%, respectively in the DP arm; 18.4% vs 11.5%, respectively in the BSC arm), and 
neutropenia (10.5% vs 6.6%, respectively in the DP arm; 9.8% vs 5.7%, respectively in the BSC 
arm). Of note, all TEAEs associated with myelosuppression were considered unrelated to study drug 
during both the prophylaxis and rescue phases (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Table 14.3.1.6). 
Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are likely to experience higher 
rates of myelosuppression due to differences in their underlying malignancy and a greater likelihood of 
treatment with myeloablative chemotherapy. Although many factors are considered in the selection of 
conditioning regimens, older age and poor performance status generally favors use of reduced 
intensity conditioning by physicians (Lee, 2008). 
During the prophylaxis phase, serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in a 
higher percentage of participants with pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm (44.1%) compared with 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 174/194 
 
 
 
 
the BSC arm (32.3%; Table 14.3.7.5.2a). There was no specific pattern to the PTs that accounted for 
this moderate difference, as the majority of PTs were reported in only 1 participant. The only serious 
TEAEs reported in ≥ 2 participants with pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm were gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage (5.1%), hypotension (3.4%), pyrexia (3.4%), respiratory failure (3.4%) and sepsis 
(3.4%); and the only serious TEAEs reported in ≥ 2 participants with pre-existing liver disease in the 
BSC arm were acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in intestine (3.2%), febrile neutropenia (3.2%), 
respiratory distress (3.2%), and stomatitis (3.2%). The percentage of participants with pre-existing 
liver disease who experienced at least 1 TEAE leading to death during the prophylaxis phase was 
similar in the DP and BSC arms (3.4% vs 3.2%, respectively; Table 14.3.7.5.5a). 
During the prophylaxis phase, treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 22.0% of participants with 
pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm (Table 14.3.7.5.3a). The only treatment-related TEAEs 
reported in ≥ 2 participants were associated with bleeding and included the PTs of gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage (5.1%) and haematochezia (3.4%). Bleeding events are consistent with the known safety 
profile of defibrotide. As expected in this open-label study where the comparator arm consists of best 
supportive care, assessments of treatment relatedness were made only in the DP arm during the 
prophylaxis phase. During the prophylaxis phase, the overall incidence of bleeding events in 
participants with pre-existing liver disease was similar in the DP arm (47.5%) and BSC arm (43.5%; 
Table 14.3.7.5.6a). The overall incidence of thromboembolic events in participants with pre-existing 
liver disease was low and similar in the DP (6.8%) and BSC (4.8%) arms (Table 14.3.7.5.7a). 
During the prophylaxis phase, within the DP arm, some PTs were reported with a ≥ 10% difference 
between the pediatric and adult participants having pre-existing liver disease. TEAEs occurring more 
frequently for the pediatric participants included engraftment syndrome, febrile neutropenia, 
hypomagnesaemia, neutropenia, pain, pyrexia, and thrombocytopenia (Table 14.3.7.5.1a). TEAEs 
occurring more frequently for the adult participants include diarrhoea, epistaxis, headache, 
hyperglycaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, nausea, and rash. For the events that showed a higher incidence 
in pediatric participants compared with adult participants in the DP arm, a consistent and similar 
difference in incidence was also generally seen between the pediatric and adult participants with pre-
existing liver disease within the BSC arm. The pediatric participants with pre-existing liver disease in 
the DP arm had a lower incidence compared to the respective adult participants for serious TEAEs 
(41.0% vs 50.0%), treatment-related TEAEs (20.5% vs 25.0%), bleeding events (43.6% vs 55.0%), 
and thromboembolic events (2.6% vs 15.0%) (Table 14.3.7.5.2a, Table 14.3.7.5.3a, Table 
14.3.7.5.6a, and Table 14.3.7.5.7a, respectively). 
Comparison of Participants with Pre-existing Liver Disease by Treatment Arm – Rescue Phase 
In the rescue phase of the study, a similar number of participants were identified as having pre-
existing liver disease in the DP arm (n=12) and BSC arm (n=10). In addition, a similar number of 
pediatric and adult participants with pre-existing liver disease were included in the rescue phase by 
randomized treatment arm: DP arm (pediatric n=5; adult n=7) and BSC arm (pediatric n=5; adult 
n=5). 
For participants with pre-existing liver disease during the rescue phase, the most commonly reported 
TEAE by PTs for those participants from the DP arm were VOD, diarrhoea, blood bilirubin increased, 
pleural effusion and pyrexia; and from the BSC arm, VOD, diarrheoa, acute kidney injury, 
hypertension, and hypotension (see Table 10 in response document). The most common events in 
either arm were associated with VOD that developed as a complication of HSCT. While the small 
subpopulations of participants with pre-existing liver disease in the rescue phase limits the safety 
analysis, no new safety signals associated with defibrotide were evident. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 175/194 
 
 
 
Further dividing the small numbers of participants with pre-existing liver disease in the rescue phase 
by age subgroups limits interpretation of any comparison. Overall, while there were some differences 
in the safety results between pediatric and adult participants with pre-existing liver disease, they were 
generally consistent and similar between the DP and BSC arms. 
Comparison of Participants with Pre-existing Liver Disease by Treatment Arm – Vital Signs and 
Laboratory Results 
For participants with pre-existing liver disease (overall, adult, and pediatric), Table 14.3.7.1.1a 
provides a summary of vital signs by treatment arm for baseline and Day +30 post- HSCT, with 
changes from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.7.1.2a provides a summary of 
vital signs by treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment, 
with changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment. 
Table 14.3.7.2.1a, Table 14.3.7.3.1a, and Table 14.3.7.4.1a provide summaries of hematology, 
chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, respectively, in participants with pre-existing liver 
disease by treatment arm at baseline and Day +30 post-HSCT, with changes from baseline to Day +30 
Post-HSCT. In this same subpopulation, Table 14.3.7.2.2a, Table 14.3.7.3.2a, and Table 14.3.7.4.2a 
provide summaries of hematology, chemistry, and coagulation laboratory results, respectively, by 
treatment arm at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment, with changes 
from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment. 
Overall, no clinically meaningful differences in the mean and median laboratory values and vital signs 
were observed between the DP and BSC treatment arms at the time points specified. Mean changes in 
laboratory parameters and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT were similar between the 
treatment arms for the overall population of participants with pre-existing liver disease, as well as both 
age subgroups. Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from VOD 
diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment were observed in the 2 treatment arms, the results 
should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants included in the rescue phase were 
small, and those with laboratory values and vital signs captured at both time points were even smaller. 
Comparison of Participants in the DP arm with Pre-existing Liver Disease to those without Pre-existing 
Liver Disease – Prophylaxis Phase 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, a smaller number of participants in the DP arm were 
identified as having pre-existing liver disease at baseline (n=59) compared with the number of 
participants in the DP arm without pre-existing liver disease (n=122; Table 14.3.7.5.1b). Of this 
subpopulation with pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm, there were more pediatric (n=39) than 
adult (n=20) participants; however, for participants without pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm, a 
similar number of participants were included in these age subgroups (pediatric n=60; adult n=62). 
The small number of participants with pre-existing liver disease and the imbalance between the 
subgroups with and without pre-existing liver disease should be considered when comparing the safety 
results. Participants with pre-existing liver disease represented only 32.6% (59/181) of the DP arm 
Safety Analysis Set. 
During the prophylaxis phase, the overall safety results were similar for participants with and without 
pre-existing liver disease (Table 11). The frequencies of the most common TEAEs (defined by 
occurrence in ≥ 15% of overall participants) were generally similar in participants with and without pre-
existing liver disease. The PTs that were reported with a ≥ 10% higher incidence for participants with 
pre-existing liver disease compared to those without pre-existing liver disease included abdominal 
pain, anaemia, blood bilirubin increased, engraftment syndrome, febrile neutropenia, 
hypoalbuminaemia, hypomagnesaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, and weight

increased. Again, it is noted that participants with pre-existing liver disease showed a higher incidence 
of TEAEs associated with myelosuppression (anaemia, febrile neutropenia/neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia). This appears to be primarily driven by the higher proportion of pediatric 
participants in this pre-existing liver disease subgroup compared with participants without pre-existing 
liver disease. In general, as described above, pediatric participants had higher rates of 
myelosuppression-related TEAEs regardless of treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 177/194 
 
 
 
 
 
During the prophylaxis phase, participants with and without pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm 
had similar incidences of serious TEAEs (44.1% vs 39.3%, respectively), fatal TEAEs (3.4% vs 6.6%, 
respectively), treatment-related AEs (22.0% vs 23.0%, respectively), bleeding events (47.5% vs 
47.5%, respectively) and thromboembolic events (6.8% vs 4.9%, respectively). 
Comparison of Participants in the DP arm with Pre-existing Liver Disease to those without Pre-existing 
Liver Disease – Rescue Phase 
In the rescue phase, a similar number of participants identified as having pre-existing liver disease at 
baseline in the DP arm (n=12) compared with the number of participants without pre-existing liver 
disease in the DP arm (n=13; Table 12). 
Within the rescue phase, for participants in the DP arm with pre-existing liver disease, the most 
commonly reported TEAE by PTs were VOD, diarrhoea, blood bilirubin increased, pleural effusion and 
pyrexia; and for participants in the DP arm without pre-existing liver disease, events included VOD, 
venoocclusive liver disease, and constipation. The most common events reported in the rescue phase 
for participants with or without pre-existing liver disease were associated with VOD that developed as 
a complication of HSCT. While the small numbers of participants with and without pre-existing liver 
disease included in the rescue phase limits the safety analysis, no new safety signals associated with 
defibrotide were evident. 
For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing liver disease, Table 14.3.7.1.1a and Table 
14.3.7.1.1b, respectively, provide summaries of vital signs for baseline and Day +30 post-HSCT, with 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023

changes from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.7.1.2a and Table 14.3.7.1.2b 
provide summaries of vital signs for participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing liver, 
respectively, at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment, with changes 
from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment. 
For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing liver disease, respective summaries at 
baseline, at Day +30 post-HSCT, and with changes from baseline to Day +30 Post-HSCT are provided 
for hematology (Table 14.3.7.2.1a and Table 14.3.7.2.1b), chemistry Table 14.3.7.3.1a and Table 
14.3.7.3.1b, and coagulation (Table 14.3.7.4.1a and Table 14.3.7.4.1b) laboratory results. For 
participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing liver disease, respective summaries at the 
time of diagnosis of VOD, at Day +30 post-VOD treatment, and with changes from VOD diagnosis to 
Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment are provided for hematology (Table 14.3.7.2.2a and Table 
14.3.7.2.2b), chemistry (Table 14.3.7.3.2a and Table 14.3.7.3.2b), and coagulation laboratory results 
(Table 14.3.7.4.2a and Table 14.3.7.4.2b). 
Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-
HSCT and from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment were observed between the 
subpopulations of participants with and without pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm, the results 
should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants with pre-existing liver disease were 
small, and smaller yet for those with laboratory values and vital signs captured at both time points 
analyzed. 
Summary of Safety in Participants with Pre-existing Liver Disease 
In this study, the safety of participants with pre-existing liver disease treated with defibrotide was 
generally consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide and with clinical events commonly 
experienced in the population studied. Some differences in TEAE frequencies in participants in the DP 
arm with pre-existing liver disease compared to the respective subpopulation in the BSC arm, as well 
as participants in the DP arm without pre-existing liver disease may have resulted from the 
disproportional number of pediatric participants with pre-existing liver disease in the DP arm. In 
general, pediatric patients following HSCT may experience a different profile of clinical adverse events 
compared to adults, given differences in underlying malignancies and exposure to myeloablative 
conditioning regimens. No new safety signals were detected for participants with pre-existing liver 
disease and administered defibrotide.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The requested analyses have been provided. 
A similar number of participants had pre-existing liver disease, based on a defined medical condition of 
hepatic disorder at baseline, in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm (n=59) and BSC arm (n=62); however, 
among those, more paediatric subjects with pre-existing liver disease were randomised to the 
defibrotide arm. A higher rate of myelosuppression was reported among subjects with pre-existing 
liver disease in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm as compared to best supportive care. This is explained 
by the MAH to pertain to the higher proportion of paediatric subjects with pre-existing liver disease in 
that arm. Overall, serious TEAEs were reported in more subjects with pre-existing liver disease in the 
defibrotide arm as compared to best supportive care (44.1% vs 32.3%). Among serious TEAEs 
reported in 2 or more participants in the defibrotide arm, gastrointestinal haemorrhage was most

frequent (reported in 5.1% of subjects; haematochezia was however also reported among 3.4%); this 
is considered in line with an increased risk of bleeding with defibrotide as labelled. 
The number of patients with pre-existing liver disease who were considered to have VOD by 
investigators and received rescue treatment with defibrotide was low (n = 22); there were no clear 
differences between those initially randomised to defibrotide prophylaxis and those randomised to best 
supportive care. 
Extensive tabulations of PTs pertaining to laboratory test abnormalities, other hepatic findings and vital 
signs have been provided, divided by treatment arm and age group. There is no grouping of such PTs 
that could be considered related which hampers the assessment. However, overall, there are no 
apparent unexpected safety findings. Similar to the overall study population, laboratory values and/or 
vital signs were missing in many study participants. 
For the comparison between patients with pre-existing liver disease in relation to those without such 
pre-existing disease, there are some differences regarding prophylaxis phase TEAEs that occurred 
more frequently among those with pre-existing liver disease, especially myelosuppression (anaemia, 
febrile neutropenia/neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia). The MAH again highlights that this could be 
due to a higher proportion of paediatric patients having pre-existing liver disease; however, there 
appears to be a higher proportion of anaemia and febrile neutropenia also among adults. Given the low 
absolute numbers of events, however, no conclusions can be made. It is somewhat reassuring that 
fatal TEAEs and bleeding events were balanced between participants with and without pre-existing liver 
disease in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm. 
Overall, no firm conclusions on the safety of defibrotide in patients with pre-existing liver disease can 
be made, however, there are no new unexpected findings. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Question 6. The findings of hypertension, hypomagnesaemia and hypokalaemia in the defibrotide group among 
subjects with pre-existing renal insufficiency should be discussed in more detail, also in relation to the overall safety 
population. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As in the previously-submitted analyses, a participant was determined to have pre-existing renal 
insufficiency if they had an abnormal renal function laboratory result at baseline, including a serum 
creatinine elevated above the normal reference range or glomerular filtration rate/creatinine clearance 
below the normal reference range. 
Comparison of Participants in the DP arm with Pre-existing Renal Insufficiency to those without Pre-
existing Renal Insufficiency – Prophylaxis Phase 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, only a small number of participants in the DP arm were 
identified as having pre-existing renal insufficiency at baseline (n=19) compared to participants 
without pre-existing renal insufficiency (n=162; Table 13). Of these subpopulations, there were more 
adult (n=15) than pediatric participants (n=4) with pre-existing renal insufficiency; and more pediatric 
(n=95) than adult participants (n=67) without pre-existing renal insufficiency in the DP arm. A 
meaningful comparison of safety for participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency to those without 
pre-existing renal insufficiency was limited due to the small population of such participants in Study 
15-007. Participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency represented only 10.5% (19/181) of the DP 
arm safety population.

During the prophylaxis phase, the overall safety results were similar in participants with and without 
pre-existing renal insufficiency (Table 13). The frequencies of the most common treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs, defined by occurrence in ≥ 20% of participants) were generally comparable 
between participants with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency. The preferred terms (PTs) that 
were reported with a ≥ 10% higher frequency in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency than 
without pre-existing renal insufficiency included decreased appetite, hypertension, and 
hypoalbuminaemia. The PTs that were reported by a ≥ 10% higher frequency in participants without 
pre-existing renal insufficiency than with pre-existing renal insufficiency included pyrexia, stomatitis, 
and vomiting. 
Serious TEAEs were reported in a higher percentage of participants in the DP arm without pre-existing 
renal insufficiency (42.0%; Table 14.3.8.5.2b) than with pre-existing renal insufficiency (31.6%; Table 
14.3.8.5.2) in the prophylaxis phase. Of note, no specific PT was reported as a serious event in more 
than 2 participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency. Fatal TEAEs in the prophylaxis phase were 
reported in a similar percentage of participants in the DP arm with pre-existing renal insufficiency 
(5.3%; Table14.3.8.5.5) and without pre-existing renal insufficiency (5.6%; Table14.3.8.5.5b). 
Treatment-related TEAEs in the prophylaxis phase were reported in a higher percentage of participants

in the DP arm with pre-existing renal insufficiency (31.6%; Table 14.3.8.5.3) than without pre-existing 
renal insufficiency (21.6%; Table 14.3.8.5.3b). Consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide, 
the majority of treatment-related TEAEs represented bleeding events in participants with and without 
pre-existing renal insufficiency. 
During the prophylaxis phase, bleeding events overall were reported in a higher percentage of 
participants in the DP arm with pre-existing renal insufficiency (57.9% [Table 14.3.8.5.6]) than those 
participants without (46.3% [Table 14.3.8.5.6b]). Participants in the DP arm with pre-existing renal 
insufficiency had a moderately higher incidence of thromboembolic events (10.5% [Table 14.3.8.5.7]) 
than participants without pre-existing renal insufficiency (4.9% [Table 14.3.8.5.7b]). As discussed in 
the initial response document, the incidence of thromboembolic events in participants with pre-existing 
renal insufficiency was comparable between the DP (10.5%) and BSC (12.0%) arms (Table 
14.3.8.5.7). 
A meaningful comparison of the safety of defibrotide in pediatric participants with and without pre-
existing renal insufficiency is limited as only 4 pediatric participants had pre-existing renal insufficiency 
during the prophylaxis phase. 
Of the 25 participants from the DP arm who were included in the rescue phase, only 3 had pre-existing 
renal insufficiency (Table 14.3.8.5.1). This precludes the analysis of safety for this small subpopulation 
during this phase of the study. 
For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency, Table 14.3.8.1.1a and 
Table 14.3.8.1.1b, respectively, provide summaries of vital signs for baseline and Day +30 post-HSCT, 
with changes from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.8.1.2a and Table 14.3.8.1.2b 
provide summaries of vital signs for participants with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency, 
respectively, at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD treatment, with changes from 
VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment. 
For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency, respective summaries 
at baseline, at Day +30 post-HSCT, and with changes from baseline to Day +30 Post-HSCT are 
provided for hematology (Table 14.3.8.2.1a and Table 14.3.8.2.1b), chemistry (Table 14.3.8.3.1a and 
Table 14.3.8.3.1b), and coagulation (Table 14.3.8.4.1a and Table 14.3.8.4.1b) laboratory results. For 
participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency, respective summaries at 
the time of diagnosis of VOD, at Day +30 post-VOD treatment, and with changes from VOD diagnosis 
to Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment are provided for hematology (Table 14.3.8.2.2a and Table 
14.3.8.2.2b), chemistry (Table 14.3.8.3.2a and Table 14.3.8.3.2b), and coagulation (Table 14.3.8.4.2a 
and Table 14.3.8.4.2b) laboratory results. 
Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-
HSCT and from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment were observed between the 
subpopulations of participants with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency in the DP arm, the 
results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants with pre-existing renal 
insufficiency are small, and smaller yet for those with laboratory values and vital signs captured at 
both time points analyzed. 
Hypertension 
Among participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency, hypertension was reported during the 
prophylaxis phase in a higher percentage of participants in the DP arm (11/19 [57.9%]) compared 
with the BSC arm (5/25 [20.0%]; Table 14.3.8.5.1). The percentage of participants in the DP arm that 
reported hypertension during the prophylaxis phase was also higher (although the difference was 
smaller) in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency (57.9%) compared with participants 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 182/194 
 
 
 
without pre-existing renal insufficiency (35.3% [Table 14.3.8.5.1b]). Renal disease and hypertension 
are often closely linked disorders in which one can be a precursor for the other. Frequent changes in 
blood pressure are also common in patients undergoing HSCT given their increased risk for infections, 
organ dysfunction, and other complications. 
For the 11 participants in the DP arm with pre-existing renal insufficiency who experienced 
hypertension event(s), the majority of events were of Grade ≤ 2, and all cases were considered 
nonserious and unrelated to study treatment (Listing 6; Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 
10.7/Listing 16.2.10.1). None of the hypertension events led to any action being taken with the study 
drug. 
For participants in the DP arm with pre-existing renal insufficiency, the baseline mean and median 
systolic (113.3 mmHg and 111.0 mmHg, respectively) and diastolic pressures (68.0 mmHg and 68.5 
mmHg, respectively) were within normal parameters (Table 14.3.8.1.1a). The mean and median 
changes from baseline to Day +30 Post-HSCT in systolic pressure were small (5.1 mmHg and 2.0 
mmHg, respectively), and these values remained within normal parameters. Similarly, the mean and 
median changes in diastolic pressure were small (3.7 mmHg and 6.0 mmHg, respectively) and 
remained within normal parameters. 
For the participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency, a summary of shift changes (low, normal, and 
high) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure values from baseline to each assessment (Table 
14.3.3.3a), as well as a summary of maximum increases/decreases from baseline in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (Table 14.3.3.2a) were prepared. Most participants with pre-existing renal 
insufficiency in either treatment arm had normal blood pressure values at baseline, and values 
remained normal throughout the study. For this same subpopulation, the mean and median maximum 
increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar for the 2 treatment arms during the 
prophylaxis phase. 
Given the very small population of participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency, limited data are 
available to support any conclusion regarding a causal association between defibrotide treatment and 
the higher incidence of hypertension TEAEs in this subpopulation of participants in the DP arm 
compared with the BSC arm. Given the co-morbidities and complications seen in patients undergoing 
HSCT, frequent changes in blood pressure are expected in this population. 
Hypomagnesaemia 
Among participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency, hypomagnesaemia was reported during the 
prophylaxis phase in a higher percentage of participants in the DP arm (36.8%) compared with the 
BSC arm (16.0%; Table 14.3.8.5.1). The percentage of participants in the DP arm that reported 
hypomagnesaemia during the prophylaxis phase was similar in participants with pre-existing renal 
insufficiency (36.8%) compared with participants without pre-existing renal insufficiency (39.5% 
[Table 14.3.8.5.1b]). For participants in the DP arm with pre-existing renal insufficiency, all reports of 
hypomagnesaemia were nonserious, of Grade ≤ 2, and considered unrelated to study treatment 
(Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 10.7/Listing 16.2.10.1). None of the hypomagnesaemia 
events led to any action being taken with the study drug. 
While there was a difference in the reported incidence of hypomagnesaemia TEAEs, the percentage of 
participants with abnormally low laboratory values for blood magnesium levels during the study was 
similar between participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency in the DP and BSC arms, regardless of 
being captured as a TEAE per investigator decision (refer to laboratory shift tables: Table 14.3.8.7.1 
and Table 14.3.8.7.2). Of participants with an available baseline value for blood magnesium, 91.7% 
(22/24) participants in the DP arm and 94.4% (17/18) participants in the BSC had an abnormally low 
blood magnesium level during the prophylaxis phase of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 183/194 
 
 
 
There was only a moderate difference in the incidence of hypomagnesaemia between the overall safety 
population in DP arm and BSC arm (39.2% vs 33.3%, respectively [Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Table 14.3.1.4]). The percentage of participants with hypomagnesaemia reported as a TEAE was 
actually numerically lower than the overall population, but similar in participants with pre-existing 
renal insufficiency than without pre-existing renal insufficiency (36.8% vs 39.5%, respectively) in the 
DP arm (Table 13). 
Overall, there is insufficient data for participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency from Study 15-
007 to support a causal association between defibrotide treatment and the higher incidence of 
hypomagnesaemia TEAEs observed in the DP arm compared with the BSC arm. In general, a high 
incidence of electrolyte abnormalities (in particular low electrolyte levels) is expected in patients 
undergoing HSCT. There are multiple pathophysiologic explanations for this observation, including but 
not limited to gastrointestinal symptoms leading to electrolyte loss, renal disease, abnormal bone 
metabolism, and the engraftment itself, leading to intracellular uptake of electrolytes. In one 
retrospective study of 48 patients who underwent autologous HSCT, high incidences of electrolyte 
abnormalities were observed: hypokalaemia, 81% (39/48), hypomagnesaemia, 67% (32/48), 
hypocalcaemia, 49% (17/35) and hypophosphataemia, 91% (39/43) (Philibert, 2008). The incidence 
of low electrolyte levels in Study 15-007 is consistent with the published incidence for similar 
populations. 
Hypokalaemia in Pediatric Participants 
Among participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency, hypokalaemia was observed in 3 of 4 pediatric 
participants in the DP arm and 0 of the 4 pediatric participants in the BSC arm during the prophylaxis 
phase (Table 14.3.8.5.1). Hypokalaemia was a very common TEAE in the 95 pediatric participants 
without pre-existing renal disease in the DP arm and was reported in 40.1% of these participants 
during the prophylaxis phase. For participants in the DP arm without pre-existing renal insufficiency, 
the incidence of hypokalemia was also modestly higher for pediatric participants (42.1%) compared 
with adult participants (37.3%; Table 14.3.8.5.1b). 
The pediatric participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency in the DP arm who reported 
hypokalaemia included younger participants ≤ 6 years of age. All hypokalaemia events in these 
pediatric participants were nonserious adverse events, and all were considered unrelated to study drug 
(Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 10.7/Listing 16.2.10.1). No action was taken with the study 
drug due to any of the hypokalaemia events. In all but one case, hypokalaemia resolved within 2 days 
of onset; the remaining event resolved 38 days after onset. In each participant, there were multiple 
factors that likely contributed to these episodes of hypokalaemia. 
• Participant 1202-1002 was a 3-year-old male who experienced 5 separate TEAEs of hypokalaemia; 3 
of which, were Grade 2 in severity and 2 events that were Grade 3 in severity. This participant was on 
the concomitant medication of furosemide (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 10.4/Listing 
16.2.6.2), a diuretic, which is frequently associated with hypokalaemia. His serum creatinine levels 
fluctuated during Study 15-007 (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 CSR/Section 10.8/Listing 16.2.11.2.1), 
and he experienced a nonserious TEAE of acute kidney injury. 
• Participant 3206-1002 was a 6-year-old female who experienced 1 event of hypokalaemia, Grade 2 
in severity. She was on the concomitant medication of furosemide. 
• Participant 9707-1003 was a 16-month-old female who experienced 1 event of hypokalaemia, Grade 
2 in severity. She was on the concomitant medication of furosemide. In addition, she experienced 
several concurrent nonserious gastrointestinal TEAEs (including vomiting and diarrhoea), which may 
have contributed to electrolyte imbalances. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 184/194 
 
 
 
While there was a difference in the reported incidence of hypokalaemia TEAEs, the percentage of 
pediatric participants with abnormally low laboratory values for blood potassium levels during the 
study was similar between participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency in the DP and BSC arms, 
regardless of being captured as a TEAE per investigator decision (refer to laboratory shift tables: Table 
14.3.8.7.1a and Table 14.3.8.7.2a). Of pediatric participants with an available baseline value for blood 
potassium, 75.0% (3/4) in the DP arm and 50% (2/4) in the BSC arm had an abnormally low blood 
potassium level during the prophylaxis phase of the study. 
Overall, hypokalaemia was a very commonly-reported TEAE during the prophylaxis phase with 39.2% 
participants in the DP and 33.3% in the BSC arms reporting this event (Module 5.3.5.4/JZP15-007 
CSR/Table 14.3.1.4), representative of the incidence in this population. Given the very small 
population of pediatric participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency limited data are available to 
support any conclusion regarding a causal association between defibrotide treatment and 
hypokalaemia. The incidence of low electrolyte abnormalities in Study 15-007 was consistent with that 
in the literature for patients undergoing HSCT. 
Summary of Safety in Participants with Pre-existing Renal Insufficiency 
In this study, the safety of defibrotide in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency was 
consistent with the known safety profile of defibrotide and with events commonly experienced in the 
study population. While the safety analyses were limited by the small number of participants with pre-
existing renal insufficiency compared with the total safety population in the DP arm, no new safety 
signals were detected.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Overall, it is somewhat reassuring that serious TEAEs were reported in a higher proportion of 
participants in the defibrotide group without pre-existing renal insufficiency than with pre-existing 
renal insufficiency in the prophylaxis phase, and that no specific PT was reported as a serious event in 
more than 2 participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency. However, the number of participants 
with pre-existing renal insufficiency was low, and a higher proportion of bleeding events was reported 
in participants with pre-existing renal insufficiency (57.9%) as compared to those without (46.3%). 
Based on the presentation of data on changes in laboratory values and vital signs from baseline to Day 
+30 post-HSCT (and from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment) in patients with and 
without renal insufficiency in the defibrotide group, no conclusions can be made. 
For hypertension among patients with renal insufficiency, the MAH has provided data on the change in 
mean and median systolic and diastolic pressures from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT in the 
defibrotide group, with an increase in systolic pressure of mean 5.1 mmHg and median 2.0 mmHg, and 
an increase in diastolic pressure in mean 3.7 mmHg and median 6.0 mmHg. These changes are 
considered small and of unclear clinical significance given that they are based on a low number of 
subjects. Of note, hypertension was reported during the prophylaxis phase of study 15-007 in a higher 
proportion of participants in the defibrotide arm (11/19 [57.9%]) compared with the best supportive 
care arm (5/25 [20.0%]); however, this is contrasted with a statement that most participants with 
pre-existing renal insufficiency in either treatment arm had normal blood pressure values at baseline, 
and values remained normal throughout the study. It is noted that mean and median systolic blood 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 185/194 
 
 
 
pressure values were lower in the defibrotide group as compared to the best supportive care group at 
baseline (median 111.0 mmHg and 123.5 mmHg respectively) and similar, for diastolic blood pressure, 
median was 68.5 mmHg in the defibrotide group and 77.0 mmHg in the best supportive care group. 
Thus, despite a lower blood pressure at baseline in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency, more 
patients in the defibrotide group were reported to have hypertension during the prophylaxis phase. 
However, the reported events of hypertension appear not to be related to any clinically significant 
increase in blood pressure at Day +30 post-HSCT. 
For hypomagnesaemia, there was a higher proportion of patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency 
during the prophylaxis phase in the defibrotide arm as compared to best supportive care. However, 
there was no difference between patients with and without pre-existing renal insufficiency based on 
reported hypomagnesaemia in the defibrotide arm, and there was no difference in proportion of 
patients with low blood magnesium levels (based on laboratory values instead of reported TEAEs) 
between the two treatment arms among those with an available magnesium value at baseline. No 
conclusions can be made. 
For hypokalaemia, it is unclear why the response has focused on the paediatric population only, with 
numerically very few events. No conclusions can be made. 
Overall, no firm conclusions on the safety of defibrotide in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency 
can be made. Despite the MAH responses not being satisfactory, it is not likely that additional analyses 
will be of value.

Question 7. For participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease at baseline in study 15-007, the MAH is asked 
to discuss the safety findings in relation to the overall safety population. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH previously provided safety analyses for participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease by 
treatment arm for the overall safety population of Study 15-007 and for pediatric and adult 
participants. To supplement the prior comparison, additional safety analyses were performed to 
compare the safety profile of defibrotide in participants randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis (DP) 
arm who had pre-existing intrinsic lung disease to those without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease. 
This comparison provides an assessment of the impact of participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung 
disease on the overall safety population. As in the previously-submitted analyses, a participant was 
determined to have pre-existing intrinsic lung disease if they had any medical condition at baseline 
within the High Level Group Terms (HLGTs) of bronchial disorders (excl neoplasms), congenital 
respiratory tract disorders, lower respiratory tract disorders (excl obstruction and infection), neonatal 
respiratory disorders, respiratory disorders NEC, and respiratory tract neoplasms. Baseline was defined 
in the Study 15-007 protocol as the day before conditioning begins for participants in the DP arm, and 
on the day that conditioning begins for participants in the best supportive care (BSC) arm. 
Comparison of Participants with Pre-existing Intrinsic Lung Disease to those without Pre-existing 
Intrinsic Lung Disease in the DP arm – Prophylaxis Phase 
During the prophylaxis phase of Study 15-007, only a small number of participants in the DP arm were 
identified as having pre-existing intrinsic lung disease at baseline (n=8 [Table 14.3.9.5.1]) compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 186/194 
 
 
 
 
with the number of participants without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm (n=173 [Table 
14.3.9.5.1b]). More pediatric participant (n=7) had pre-existing intrinsic lung disease compared to 
adults (n=1); whereas, the number of participants in the DP arm without pre-existing intrinsic lung 
disease was similar for pediatric (n=92) and adult (n=81) participants. The types of pre-existing 
intrinsic lung disease seen in the DP arm included peripheral oedema (in 2 participants) and interstitial 
lung disease, lung consolidation, lung disorder, metastases to lung, pulmonary mass/respiratory 
distress, and respiratory acidosis (1 participant each). The types of pre-existing intrinsic lung disease 
seen in the BSC arm included pulmonary mass (in 3 participants), lung disorder and respiratory failure 
(2 participants each), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive pulmonary disease (1 
participant each) (Table 14.1.6b). A comparison of safety data for participants with pre-existing 
intrinsic lung disease to those without pre-existing lung disease was limited due to the very small 
numbers of such participants in Study 15-007. Participants with pre-existing lung disease represented 
only 4.4% (8/181) of the safety population in the DP arm. During the prophylaxis phase, for 
participants in the DP arm with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease, the most commonly reported TEAE 
by preferred terms (PTs) included hypokalaemia, pyrexia, anaemia, neutropenia, and 
hypomagnesaemia (Table 14). For participants in the DP arm without pre-existing intrinsic lung 
disease, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) by PTs included 
nausea, pyrexia, diarrhoea, stomatitis, and vomiting. The small size of the population of participants 
with pre-existing lung disease prevents the meaningful identification of any trends and for any 
conclusions to be made. 
Assessment report  
EMA/52066/2023 
Page 187/194 
 
 
 
  
During the prophylaxis phase, participants with and without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease reported 
a similar incidence of serious TEAEs (50.0% vs 40.5%, respectively [Table 14.3.9.5.2 and Table 
14.3.9.5.2b]) and treatment-related TEAEs (25% vs 22.5%, respectively [Table 14.3.9.5.3 and Table 
14.3.9.5.3b]). No TEAE by PT was reported as serious in more than 1 participant with pre-existing 
intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 2 participants with pre-
existing intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm; events included cerebral haemorrhage and haemoptysis. 
The majority of treatment-related TEAEs in participants without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease were 
also related to bleeding events. These results are consistent with the known safety profile of 
defibrotide. During the prophylaxis phase, there were no participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung 
disease who experienced a fatal TEAE (Table14.3.9.5.5) compared to 5.8% of participants without pre-
existing intrinsic lung disease (Table14.3.9.5.5b). 
Overall, bleeding events were reported in a higher percentage of participants with pre-existing intrinsic 
lung disease (6/8 [75%]; Table 14.3.9.5.6) than those without (80/173 [46.2%]; Table 14.3.9.5.6b). 
There were no thromboembolic events reported in participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease 
(Table 14.3.9.5.7), while such events were reported in 5.8% of participants without pre-existing 
intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm (Table 14.3.9.5.7b). 
Comparison of Participants in the DP arm with Pre-existing Intrinsic Lung Disease to those without Pre-
existing Intrinsic Lung Disease – Rescue Phase: A comparison of the safety results for participants in 
DP arm with and without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease was not possible during the rescue phase, 
since only 1 of 25 participants was identified as having pre-existing intrinsic lung disease (Table 
14.3.9.5.1). 
Comparison of Participants in the DP arm with Pre-existing Intrinsic Lung Disease to those without Pre-
existing Intrinsic Lung Disease – Vital Signs & Laboratory Results 
For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease, Table 14.3.9.1.1a 
and Table 14.3.9.1.1b, respectively, provide summaries of vital signs for baseline and Day +30 post-
HSCT, with changes from baseline to Day +30 post-HSCT. Similarly, Table 14.3.9.1.2a and Table 
14.3.9.1.2b provide summaries of vital signs for participants with and without pre-existing intrinsic 
lung disease, respectively, at the time of diagnosis of VOD and Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment 
with changes from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment.

For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease, respective 
summaries at baseline, at Day +30 post-HSCT, and with changes from baseline to Day +30 Post-HSCT 
are provided for hematology (Table 14.3.9.2.1a and Table 14.3.9.2.1b), chemistry (Table 14.3.9.3.1a 
and Table 14.3.9.3.1b), and coagulation (Table 14.3.9.4.1a and Table 14.3.9.4.1b) laboratory results. 
For participants in the DP arm with and without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease, respective 
summaries at the time of diagnosis of VOD, at Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment, and with changes 
from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 Post-VOD rescue treatment are provided for hematology (Table 
14.3.9.2.2a and Table 14.3.9.2.2b), chemistry (Table 14.3.9.3.2a and Table 14.3.9.3.2b), and 
coagulation (Table 14.3.9.4.2a and Table 14.3.9.4.2b) laboratory results. 
Although some substantial changes in laboratory values and vital signs from baseline to Day +30 post-
HSCT and from VOD diagnosis to Day +30 post-VOD rescue treatment were observed between the 
subpopulations of participants with and without pre-existing intrinsic lung disease in the DP arm, the 
results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of participants with pre-existing intrinsic 
lung disease were very small, and smaller yet for those with laboratory values and vital signs captured 
at both time points analyzed. 
Summary of Safety in Participants with Pre-existing Intrinsic Lung Disease 
While very few participants with pre-existing intrinsic lung disease received defibrotide in this study 
limiting any comparisons of safety to participants without pre-existing lung disease, no new safety 
signals for defibrotide were detected. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested analyses. Due to the low number of patients in the defibrotide 
prophylaxis arm who had pre-existing lung disease at baseline, no firm conclusions can be drawn, 
however, based on the data provided, there are no unexpected safety findings.

Safety / RMP  
Given the clear lack of benefit shown in this study, the well documented off label use in the 
prophylactic setting (See also EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0058) raises substantial concerns, as the safety 
profile of this product is not benign. It is therefore considered important to communicate directly to 
concerned health care professionals about these new data. The MAH is asked to submit a draft for a 
Direct Healthcare Professionals Communication (DHPC) together with a draft Communication plan 
(see also GVP Module XV – Safety communication including Annex II with templates for the DHPC and 
Communication plan). The key points to address include the main efficacy results in the prophylactic 
setting together with a summary of the main safety problems with the product.

16.  Assessment of the responses to the 3nd request for 
supplementary information 
Q1 Safety / RMP  
Request for DHPC 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges the request from EMA and appreciates the expeditious review. We would like 
to provide the following clarification in response to this request and highlight that additional Direct 
Healthcare Professional (DHPC) communication would be unnecessary as the overall benefit-risk 
balance of defibrotide remains unchanged. 
The MAH would like to highlight that no new safety concerns from the study have been raised, as 
agreed by the EMA in the assessment report “For the safety concerns addressed by this study, overall, 
no firm conclusions can be drawn; however, no new safety concerns have been identified”. The safety 
profile of defibrotide from the clinical development programme and post marketing use globally 
(>15000 patients) has also been shown to remain positive as reflected in the PRAC approved PBRER 
reports. This provides extensive evidence on the favourable benefit-risk balance of defibrotide in the 
approved indication. The MAH is concerned that since DHPC letters are sent out when there is a clear 
new safety signal, a DHPC communication additional to the communication (as described below) 
already implemented by the MAH may create confusion among HCPs on the use of defibrotide also in 
the approved indication. This in-turn may risk patient best care management. 
In addition, the MAH has made changes to the SmPC (as per EMA request) and implemented an 
extensive global communication plan communicating the results (efficacy and safety) from study 15-
007 to Healthcare Professionals globally both directly and publicly. 
The global communication plan, regarding study 15-007 futility (not meeting the primary endpoint of 
the study) and summary of the efficacy and safety results, included the following: 
•  A press release worldwide following the Interim analysis on 29 April 2020 (copy enclosed). 
Direct communication and presentation of the final study results (efficacy and safety) to all 140

study sites (including PI and site study team), regardless of the site enrolment status, globally. 
This personal communication comprised of three Virtual Zoom regional meetings (US, 
EU/Israel and Middle East and APAC) held on 29 April 2021. The 140 study sites are comprised 
of transplant centres in Europe and globally that perform at least 100 transplants annually. 
The final study results have been published on global Health Authority clinical trial websites 
(including but not limited to EudraCT, Clintrials.gov). 
In addition, the final efficacy and safety results have been presented at international 
congresses 
• 
• 
(ASH 2021 and EBMT 2022) with extensive presence of transplant physicians from Europe and 
worldwide. A full manuscript is also being prepared for publication in peer reviewed scientific journals. 
Importantly, it is not common regulatory practice to provide a DHPC to proactively address an off-label 
indication, especially in the absence of a clear new safety signal and would represent a significant 
regulatory shift in purpose and management of communications to HCPs. DHPC are typically used to 
highlight safety risks for an approved indication, and not to address unmet efficacy results from a 
study investigating an unapproved indication where no new safety concerns were found. The guidance 
and EMA DHPC template are specifically for safety concerns (GVP Module XV – Safety communication 
including Annex II with templates for the DHPC and Communication plan), which is not the case here 
for defibrotide. 
The MAH would like to emphasize that the use of defibrotide off-label is not promoted by Jazz and is 
entirely at the discretion of the treating HCP, as the case with many other products, and is out of 
control of the MAH. The MAH has no direct means of measuring and monitoring off label use. However, 
enrolment data from DefiFrance showed a decline in the number of patients who received defibrotide 
prophylaxis over the previous years. 
Of note, as part of commitments by the MAH and in compliance with regulatory requirements, study 
15- 007 results and the final CSR were also submitted to other global regulatory authorities and Post- 
Marketing Requirements (PMR) closure approved. 
Given the above, we hope that the PRAC and CHMP Rapporteur agree that additional DHPC 
communication is unwarranted. We also hope that the EMA agree that the communication plan already 
implemented by the MAH in sharing the results from the 15-007 study has been sufficiently 
comprehensive, and that the overall benefit-risk profile of the drug remains unchanged as no new 
safety signals have been identified as part of this study. As the MAH, we confirm our commitment to 
continued monitoring of safety of defibrotide within the EU and globally with the ultimate aim of 
helping to improve patients’ best care management. 
PRAC Rapp's comment: 
The MAH is reluctant to send out a DHPC as there is no new safety signal changing the overall B/R. In 
this case however, the rational for the DHPC is to avoid exposure (and thus possibly severe adverse 
events) in a population where lack of efficacy has been shown. The efforts made by the MAH to 
present data from the study is acknowledged. Nevertheless, as shown in DefiFrance (see 
EMEA/H/C/002393/II/0058) the off label use for prevention has been extensive with a large number of 
patients at risk for adverse events without anticipated benefit of use it is important that the 
information is distributed to all concerned bodies not only the academic community and study centres.

Thus a DHPC with a communication plan is still requested. The comments from PRAC (See section 9 
and attachments) should be taken onboard (LoOI). 
Issue not resolved. 
Q2 SmPC Section 5.1 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges and accepts all of the changes made by the authorities but has made slight 
amendments as followed:  
1. In the last paragraph prior to the paediatric population subsection in 5.1 of the SmPC the MAH has 
rejected the deletion of “During prophylaxis” and re-introduced this into the label. Per responses 
provided in sequence 0132 this paragraph presents data from the prophylaxis phase of the study and 
therefore this should be explicitly stated to ensure the context of the information is interpreted 
correctly.  
2. In the same paragraph prior to the paediatric population subsection in 5.1 of the SmPC the MaH 
acknowledges the comment by the authorities related to overall mortality and has accept the new 
wording describing mortality at day +30. The MAH however has rejected the deletion of data 
presenting fatalities related to TEAEs “...,and fatal TEAEs (5.5% vs 5.7%, respectively)”. This data 
again provides more context for prophylaxis phase of the study, further is more clinically relevant to 
clinicians. With the addition of the new proposed wording for deaths at day+30 post HSCT this should 
provide a balanced presentation of the relevant data from the study.  
3. In the paediatric population subsection of 5.1 in the SmPC the MAH acknowledges the rationale by 
the authorities to not mix the populations of prophylaxis and treatment. The MAH however believes the 
number of paediatric patients provides valuable context to clinicians considering the rare nature of the 
disease VOD and the limited availability of paediatric data in general. The MAH has therefore included 
the figure of ped patients from the three treatment studies only: Subjects <18 years who received 
Defitelio at the 25 mg/kg/day dose level.

PRAC Rapp's comment: 
Most concerns raised in the last round of assessment are addressed but there are three points 
where the PRAC’s proposal was not implemented.  
Re point 1 above: The whole context is about study 15-007 and thus it appears confusing rather 
than clarifying to repeat the information about prophylactic use when presenting data on adverse 
events. For clarity the study could be presented in one single paragraph instead of split in three.  
Re point 2: It is not acceptable to retain this text. The data to be presented is the number of deaths 
as now included (and which the MAH accepts to retain) and it would be confusing to add in addition 
numbers of fatal events as these numbers differs. It is not agreed that the latter would be more 
relevant for the prescribers, rather the contrary.  
Re point 3: The inclusion of the number of paediatric subjects treated is accepted. However, the text 
in brackets should be moved to avoid misinterpretation.  
Thus, further updates to the SmPC are warranted (LoOI) 
Issue partly resolved. 
17.  4rd Request for supplementary information 
RMP 
The MAH is asked to submit a draft for a Direct Healthcare Professionals Communication (DHPC) 
together with a draft Communication plan (see also GVP Module XV – Safety communication including 
Annex II with templates for the DHPC and Communication plan). The key points to address include the 
main efficacy results in the prophylactic setting together with a summary of the main safety problems 
with the product. The comments from the PRAC at its meeting on 2-5 May, should be taken onboard.  
SmPC 
Please see appended SmPC. 
18.  Responses to the 4rd Request for supplementary 
information 
RMP 
The MAH provided a draft DHPC with communication plan which was assessed and found not 
acceptable at the PRAC May meeting. Following up to this PRAC drafted a proposal which was accepted 
by the MAH with some proposals for minor amendments. This text (entitled: Defitelio (defibrotide): Not 
recommended for prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after post-hematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation (HSCT) is deemed acceptable.  
Issue resolved.

SmPC 
The MAH has submitted an updated SmPC revised as requested by CHMP. A few additional editorial 
changes were made, which are all acceptable. Nevertheless, the version of the SmPC submitted did not 
include the update of Annex E agreed in procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/S/0057. Whereas study 15-007 
(subjected to the present procedure) is accurately no longer listed as a specific obligation, the new 
measure (In order to further characterise the efficacy and safety of Defitelio in the treatment of severe 
hepatic veno-occlusive disease, the MAH should provide yearly updates on any new information 
concerning the safety and efficacy of Defitelio) is not included.  
The company has provided an updated PI to list the new specific obligation as agreed in the annual- 
reassessment procedure EMEA/H/C/002393/S/0057.   
Issue resolved. 
At the CHMP meeting in May 2022, the CHMP requested to the company to change the DHPC and 
communication plan: This text (entitled: Defitelio (defibrotide): Dot not use for prophylaxis of veno-
occlusive disease (VOD) after post-hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT)  
This update was agreed with the MAH.

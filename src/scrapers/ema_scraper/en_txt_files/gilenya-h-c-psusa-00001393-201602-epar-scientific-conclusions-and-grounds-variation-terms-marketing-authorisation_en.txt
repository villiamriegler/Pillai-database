Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for fingolimod, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
305  cases  of  thrombocytopenia  (180  serious  and  125  non  serious)  were  reported  cumulatively  and 
80  cases  (41  serious  and  39  non  serious)  during  the  reporting  interval.  Among  the  180  serious 
cases  of  thrombocytopenia cumulatively the MAH identified 31 Grade 4 among the cases where 
laboratory value is  reported. 24 cases of positive dechallenge were reported cumulatively including 5 
new cases in this PSUR  period. 4 cases of rechallenge were reported cumulatively. 
3  cases of Kaposi’s sarcoma  were  reported  cumulatively 16  months, 15 months  and  3.5  years  after 
the  start  of  fingolimod.  Another  case  was  also  reported  following  the  literature  assessment  after 
the  Data  Lock Point of this PSUR on fingolimod treatment. All the 4 cases were biopsy confirmed and 
occurred > 1  year  (16  months,  15  months,  3.5  years  and  4  years)  after  the  start  of  fingolimod, 
with  no  history  of  immunosuppressive agent, HIV negative serology. In those 4 cases there are no 
other aetiology reported  to  explain  Kaposi’s  sarcoma  except  fingolimod  exposure.  Even  if  the 
time  to  onset  is  short,  the  chronology  is  compatible  with  a  relationship  between  Kaposi’s 
sarcoma  and  fingolimod  treatment.  It  is  important to consider that healthcare professionals should 
have this information to correctly monitor their  patient  on  fingolimod  therapy.  4  cases  of  Kaposi’s 
sarcoma  represent  already  a  signal  and  Kaposi’s  sarcoma should be added to the SmPC. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the  product information of medicinal products containing fingolimod were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for fingolimod the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fingolimod is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes  to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol, 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A total of 30 spontaneous cases were received describing 31 adverse events according to the pre-defined 
preferred terms for urinary adverse events associated with umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol (UMEC/VI).  
From those, a total of 12 spontaneous case reports were considered detailed enough to perform a full 
evaluation, and they comprised 13 urinary adverse events: 8 serious events of urinary retention, 2 serious 
events of urinary tract obstruction reported, 2 non-serious cases of urine flow decreased and 1 micturition 
frequency decreased. A close latency to onset (≤ 2 weeks) following start of treatment with UMEC/VI was 
reported in 7/12 evaluable cases. In 8 cases, there was evidence of positive dechallenge following 
discontinuation of UMEC/VI.  
“Urinary retention” is a known class effect of anticholinergic drugs (Halpin, 2015 Stephenson, 2011; Afonso, 
2011) and a warning is already included in the SmPC recommending the use of UMEC/VI with caution in 
patients with urinary retention.  
Based on the results of the cumulative evaluations and considering the pharmacological plausibility of 
anticholinergic effect on urinary function, there is sufficiently robust evidence to warrant an update of the 
Product Information with ‘urinary retention, bladder outlet obstruction and dysuria" as ADRs associated to 
UMEC/VI.  
Therefore,  in  view  of  the  data  presented  in  the  reviewed  PSUR,  the  PRAC  considers  that  changes  to  the 
product information of medicinal products containing umeclidinium bromide /vilanterol are warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.  
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

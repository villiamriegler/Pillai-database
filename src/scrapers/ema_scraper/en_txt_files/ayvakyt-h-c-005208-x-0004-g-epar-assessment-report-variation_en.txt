2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM 
AHN) or mast cell leukaemia (MCL). 
The claimed therapeutic indication reads as follows: 
•  AYVAKYT  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  systemic 
mastocytosis (AdvSM), including aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with 
an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one 
systemic therapy. 
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare clonal mast cell (MC) neoplasm, primarily driven by MCs carrying the 
KIT D816V mutation that results in constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor tyrosine 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

kinase. This causes the proliferation, infiltration, and abnormal activation of MCs, leading to debilitating MC-
mediator symptoms and, in a subset of patients, organ damage and poor survival (Gilreath et al, 2019; 
Pardanani 2019). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The SM subclassification based on WHO criteria is provided in the table below: 
Table 1 Systemic Mastocytosis Subclassification Based on WHO Criteria 
Systemic mastocytosis preferentially affects Caucasians and there is no sex predominance. Most cases of 
systemic mastocytosis are sporadic and not inherited, occurring in people with no family history of the 
condition. 
Patients with nonadvanced SM (90% to 95% of SM patients) primarily have ISM, but a small number of patients 
have the SSM variant, which is associated with increased organ infiltration and MC burden (Swerdlow et al, 
2017). Although organ infiltration by MCs is less extensive in patients with ISM, MC activation leads to severe, 
even life-threatening, MC mediator-related symptoms and a poor quality of life (Pardanani 2019; Gilreath et 
al, 2019). Patients with ISM progress to AdvSM in approximately 2% of cases. Patients with SSM progress to 
AdvSM or transform to leukemia in approximately 9% of cases and have a worse survival compared with ISM 
patients (Trizuljak et al, 2020; Sperr et al, 2019).  
Patients  with  both  nonadvanced  and  advanced  SM  suffer  from  a  wide  variety  of  severe  and  unpredictable 
symptoms and reduced quality of life. Patients have limited treatment options, and the low awareness of SM 
can result in diagnosis being delayed for several years (Jennings et al, 2018), suboptimal patient care, and 
exacerbation of the high unmet medical need in this population. 
SM  with  the  copresence  of  an  AHN  (SM-AHN)  comprises  75%  of  AdvSM  cases  (Lim  et  al,  2009).  The  AHN 
component  is  typically  myeloid,  including  CMML,  MDS,  MPN,  CEL,  and  AML  (Pardanani  2019).  SM-AHN 
commonly presents with C-findings and has a median OS of 24 to 35 months (Lim et al, 2009; Sperr et al, 
2019). 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 10/155 
 
 
 
SM with C-findings, but without additional adverse pathologic features, is rare and known as ASM, which has 
a median OS of 41 to 68 months (Lim et al, 2009; Sperr et al, 2019). 
The presence of excess (≥ 20%) MCs in the BM aspirate smear is characteristic of a rare, highly aggressive SM 
variant known as MCL. MCL commonly presents with C-findings and can co-occur with AHN. MCL has the worst 
prognosis of all SM variants, with a median survival of 2 to 23 months (Lim et al, 2009; Sperr et al, 2019). 
An overview of prevalence and incidence of SM in the EU is provided in the following table: 
Table 2 Overview of Prevalence and Incidence of Systemic Mastocytosis 
2.1.3.  Biologic features Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Systemic mastocytosis is a clonal mast cell neoplasm, driven by the KIT D816V mutation, where abnormal 
activation of MC leads to debilitating life-threatening symptoms. Although heterogeneity characterizes the 
clinical presentation and prognosis of SM, the pathogenesis is largely shared, with gain of function D816 KIT 
mutations occurring in 93% of SM cases, regardless of subtype (Garcia-Montero et al, 2006). This shared 
molecular pathogenesis suggests that a potent, selective, targeted agent against the KIT D816V mutation 
could be effective across SM subtypes, regardless of the clinicopathological presentation.

EMA/135619/2022 
Page 11/155 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The formal diagnosis of SM is based on pathologic and laboratory criteria established by the WHO (Swerdlow 
et al, 2017). A diagnosis of SM can be made with the documentation of multifocal dense infiltrates of neoplastic 
MCs in BM and/or other extracutaneous organs (major criterion) and at least 1 of the following minor criteria: 
•  Atypical MC morphology in BM and/or extracutaneous tissues 
• 
Presence of the KIT D816V mutation in BM, blood, or other extracutaneous organ 
•  Abnormal expression of CD25 with or without CD2 on MCs in BM, blood, or other extracutaneous 
organ 
• 
Elevated serum tryptase levels 
If the major criterion is not present, a diagnosis of SM can still be made if 3 of the 4 minor criteria are fulfilled. 
SM can be broadly divided into advanced and nonadvanced disease, based on the degree of organ infiltration 
(B-findings) and organ damage (C-findings) present, as well as the presence of adverse pathologic features 
(Table 1). 
Table 3: B- and C-Findings in Systemic Mastocytosis 
The advanced forms of SM have features of aggressive leukemias. Patients with AdvSM (comprising 5% to 10% 
of patients with SM) have adverse clinicopathologic features and poor OS, even with available therapies; see 
below. These adverse features include organ damage due to MC infiltration (C-findings), copresence of an AHN, 
and/or excess MCs in the marrow aspirate (Cohen et al, 2014). C-findings are heterogeneous and may occur 
throughout the body. 
There are three subtypes within AdvSM: ASM, SM-AHN and MCL. A diagnosis of ASM requires the presence of 
WHO C-findings in the absence of adverse pathological features. It is characterized by findings such as low 
blood cell count, enlarged spleen and decreased bone density, leading to fractures. Median overall survival is 
41–68 months. SM-AHN and MCL are often, but not always, associated with WHO C-findings and do not 
require this for diagnosis. The MCL diagnosis requires the presence of > 20% MCs in the bone marrow 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 12/155 
 
 
 
aspirate smear. MCL is further characterized by findings such as infiltration of the abnormal mast cells in 
bone marrow, blood, and other organs. MCL may occur de novo or secondary to previous mastocytosis. The 
rapid accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow ultimately results in multi-organ failure. Median overall 
survival is 2-23 months. A diagnosis of SM-AHN requires the copresence of AHN. This is the most common 
subtype of AdvSM, with approximately 70% of cases. The AHN component is often underdiagnosed resulting 
in frequent reclassification whenever patients are referred to centers of excellence. Median overall survival is 
24-35 months for SM-AHN. 
As indicated above, the prognosis for patients with systemic mastocytosis varies between subtypes. Features 
that may be associated with a poorer prognosis may include: elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia,  hypoalbuminemia,  excess  bone  marrow  blasts,  high  alkaline  phosphatase, 
hepatosplenomegaly and ascites. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Patients with AdvSM have limited treatment options. In AdvSM, current recommended therapies include 
midostaurin (approved in US and EU for all subtypes of AdvSM), cladribine, interferon-alfa (both used off-
label), and imatinib (approved in US only for a subset of ASM patients). Despite the approval of midostaurin 
for treatment of AdvSM in 2017, cladribine is still recommended for patients who need rapid debulking or for 
patients who have to discontinue midostaurin due to toxicity, and interferon is recommended for patients 
with slow PD without the need for rapid cytoreduction (NCCN 2020; Pardanani 2019; Sperr et al, 2019). In 
addition, a number of medicines are used for symptom management. Antihistamines are commonly used. 
Cromolyn sodium, ketotifen and leukotriene-modifying agents are additional medications which may provide 
benefit. 
2.2.  About the product 
Avapritinib (BLU-285) is a small molecule protein kinase inhibitor (ATC classification code L01EX18). It is a 
potent and selective inhibitor of mutated KIT kinase (including mutations of the D816 codon) and of the 
structurally related PDGFRA, targeting the active conformation of the kinase. 
Avapritinib shows broad inhibitory activity against both primary and secondary KIT and PDGFRA mutants with 
most potent activity against activation loop mutants. 
The KIT D816V activation loop mutation targeted by avapritinib is present in >95% of patients with SM 
(Garcia-Montero et al, 2006). 
Avapritinib is currently approved for treatment of GIST. The recommended starting dose is 300 mg. 
The claimed new indication is: “AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm 
(SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy.”

For AdvSM, the recommended starting dose of avapritinib is 200 mg orally once daily, on an empty stomach 
(see Method of administration). This once daily 200 mg dose is also the maximum recommended dose that 
must not be exceeded by patients with AdvSM. Treatment should be continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Treatment with avapritinib is not recommended in patients with platelet count < 50 x 109/L (see Table 2 and 
section 4.4). 
Concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If concomitant 
use with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib must be reduced 
from 200 mg to 50 mg orally once daily (see section 4.5). 
Dose modifications for adverse reactions 
Interruption of treatment with or without dose reduction may be considered to manage adverse reactions 
based on severity and clinical presentation.  
The dose should be adjusted based on safety and tolerability.  
The recommended dose reductions and modifications for adverse reactions are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

ranging from 25,000 to 50,000/µL at baseline who were treated at a starting dose of 100 mg QD. With 
Protocol Amendment 5, patient with platelet counts < 50,000/µL were excluded from enrollment. 
Initial scientific advice (SA) from the CHMP, SAWP, regarding the SM program for avapritinib was received on 
31 May 2018 (procedure EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III). This SA procedure addressed the nonclinical and 
clinical  development  of  avapritinib  as  well  as  the  development  of  PRO  questionnaires  for  the  AdvSM  and 
ISM/SSM indications in the EU. The SA procedure also included advice on the planned efficacy and safety data 
to be submitted in support of an indication for treatment of AdvSM.  
During  the  SA  the  proposed  design  of  the  single-arm  open-label  study  BLU-285-2202  was  questioned 
particularly with regards to the inclusion of both midostaurin-naïve patients and experienced patients under 
the same protocol: “While investigating patients with prior exposure in a single arm trial might be considered 
acceptable,  and  whilst  authorisation  based  on  a  single-arm  trial  cannot  be  precluded,  a  single  arm  trial  for 
midostaurin-naïve  patients  is  not  supported  and  a  randomised  study  versus  midostaurin,  appropriately 
designed  to  ensure  blinding,  is  strongly  recommended.  To  comply  with  this  recommendation,  whilst  still 
investigating the benefit /risk of avapritinib in the proposed broad population, an acceptable protocol design 
could include a comparison of midostaurin-naïve patients randomized to midostaurin or avapritinib, along with 
an uncontrolled cohort investigating avapritinib in midostaurin pre-treated patients, analysed separately.” 
Additionally, the CHMP expressed concerns regarding the proposed sample size: “In a study including only 60 
patients, divided by three different disease entities with very different prognosis, one cannot expect to obtain 
reliable and interpretable efficacy and safety results.  Acknowledging the difficulty in recruiting patients, the 
Applicant is recommended to increase the study size.”  
 Upon consideration of the CHMP scientific advice, the MAH continued with the initial study design and size.” 
On 18 September 2020, a request for Simultaneous National Scientific Advice was submitted to the Spanish 
Agency of Medicines and Medical Products and to the Norwegian Medicines Agency for a planned external-
control, observational, retrospective study (BLU-285-2405). The objective is to generate real-world data on 
the best available therapy used to treat patients with AdvSM and to conduct comparative analyses of clinical 
outcomes between patients treated with avapritinib vs. best available therapy. A meeting was held on 17 
November 2020.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The scope of this extension application is the addition of two strengths, i.e. 25 mg film-coated tablets and 50 
mg film-coated tablets, indicated for in adult patients to reduce and adjust the dose in the event of adverse 
reactions following a starting dose of 200 mg once daily. 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets  containing 25 mg or 50 mg of avapritinib as active 
substance, respectively.  
Other ingredients are:

EMA/135619/2022 
Page 17/155 
 
 
 
 
 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, copovidone, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate 
Tablet coat: talc, macrogol 3350, poly(vinyl alcohol), titanium dioxide (E171) 
The product is available in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with child-resistant cap (polypropylene) 
with foiled induction seal liner (pulp backed heat induction foil) and a desiccant in canister as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance documentation is identical to that of the previously approved authorised strengths and 
is acceptable.  
Physico-chemical properties of the active substance that are relevant for the new strengths have been 
adequately addressed in the pharmaceutical development of the finished product. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white round tablet with debossed text. One side reads ‘BLU’ and other 
side reads ‘25’ or ‘50’; they measure approximately 5 mm and 6.35 mm in diameter respectively. All tablet 
strengths are manufactured using a common blend and are therefore proportional in active substance and 
excipients. All strengths of the proposed commercial tablets are the same colour but they have different size 
and marking. The different tablet strengths are distinguishable at a level sufficient to avoid mistakes among 
the different strengths by the final user. 
The goal of the pharmaceutical development was to develop two new strengths, i.e. 25 mg film-coated 
tablets and 50 mg film-coated tablets. 
The quality target product profile product (QTPP) and development targets for the 25 mg and 50 mg tablets 
are the same as those of the approved tablets (see initial EPAR).  
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) for the new strengths are the same as those of the approved ones. The 
physical and chemical properties of the active substance that were measured to facilitate the identification of 
possible active substance CQAs and material attributes, that could influence the performance or 
manufacturability of the new strengths are the same as for the approved tablets. All finished product CQAs 
are monitored by means of a comprehensive control strategy that includes process design and validated 
methods for process inputs, in-process controls and final product release tests. The control strategy of the 
new strengths is the same as the control strategy of the approved strengths. 
All the excipients used for the new strengths are the same as those of the approved tablets, with the 
exception of Opacode blue printing ink, which is not used for the 25 mg and 50 mg strength tablets as they 
are debossed. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 18/155 
 
 
 
Details of formulation development have been previously provided for the already approved strengths and 
are applicable to the new strengths, with the exception of the omission of the printing ink.   
The dissolution method used in the 25 mg and 50 mg strength tablets is the same as the approved 
commercial dissolution method. The data provided confirm that the method is able to discriminate between 
batches showing differences in those parameters/attributes. 
Since the tablet is manufactured from a common blend, the 50 mg tablet was considered bracketed in this 
study and the current commercial dissolution method was determined to be acceptable for the additional 
dosage strengths. 
A biowaiver was requested for 25 mg and 50 mg strength based on f2 equivalence to the 100 mg tablet. This 
was accepted due to similarity of the formulations, linear pharmacokinetics are established, and have 
comparable dissolution profiles. 
The finished product used in the bioequivalence studies (25 mg and 100 mg) is coated but the tablets do not 
have any marking: they are neither printed nor debossed; the clinical material was manufactured at a 
different site from the proposed manufacturing site of the finished product. When the manufacturing process 
was transferred to the commercial site, the manufacturing process flow remained unchanged and the 
equipment was similar with some exceptions, not expected to impact the CQAs of the finished product. Data 
from in-process testing and release testing confirmed the comparability of the commercial finished product 
with the product used in the bioequivalence study. Characterisation and optimisation studies were performed 
to ensure that the process was suitably robust and well-controlled prior to validation.  
Historical manufacturing data were reviewed, a risk assessment conducted, and additional processing ranging 
(DoE) studies were conducted along with other studies. This work has resulted in a thorough understanding 
of the manufacturing process and appropriate points of control. Critical process parameters have been 
defined and appropriate ranges have been established for all process parameters.  The applicant references 
to  design spaces in the manufacturing process development have been amended as  the information 
submitted of these DoEs is not sufficient to establish design spaces and only NORs and PARs are established. 
Therefore, the applicant does not claim a design space and the relevant sections of the Module 3 have been 
updated accordingly. 
The primary packaging is high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with child-resistant cap (polypropylene) 
with foiled induction seal liner (pulp backed heat induction foil) and a desiccant. The material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The new proposed strengths of finished product are manufactured by one manufacturing site which is 
different from the currently approved manufacturing site for the 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg strengths.  
 The manufacturing process of the 25 mg 50 mg is the same as that for the approved 100 mg, 200 mg and 
300 mg strengths, with the exception of imprinting, as the Patheon 25 mg and 50 mg tablets are debossed. 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
A satisfactory validation scheme to support the manufacture of the 25 mg and 50 mg tablets has been 
provided, this is acceptable for a standard manufacturing process. The results of in-process controls and the 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 19/155 
 
 
 
analysis of the samples performed at each step demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identity (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), content 
uniformity (Ph. Eur .), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities for the 25 and 50 mg tablets has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or 
the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  The Reference Standards used for the analysis of the finished product is the same as for 
the active substance and they have considered satisfactory. 
Batch analysis results are provided for batches of 50 mg confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the approved specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from  primary (registration) pilot scale  batches of the  strength 25 mg  and 100 mg batches of 
finished product stored for up to 12 months under  long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product 
are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay  (HPLC),  degradants,  dissolution,  water  content,  solid  form  and 
microbial enumeration. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed under long term and accelerated conditions. 
A temperature cycling study was initiated for the 25 mg and 50 mg tablets to study the effect of exposure to 
extreme temperatures on product quality when stored in the commercial container closure system.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 20/155 
 
 
 
 The data showed that exposure to these extreme temperatures has little to no impact to product quality or 
tablet performance. In addition, the finished product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products The photostability data showed that the finished 
product is not sensitive to light; no changes were observed . 
A degradation study exposing tablets to extreme temperature and humidity conditions (80°C/75%RH)  was 
performed on  bulk tablet manufactured with the intended commercial manufacturing process. The results 
show a lower amount of degradation than the authorised strengths.  
A simulated in-use study was initiated  to study the effect of use of the product in practice via opening and 
closing the bottle daily at 15.0 – 25.0°C over 97 days. Complete study data were provided; the results for 
appearance, assay, degradation, dissolution, and water content were presented. No degradant growth was 
observed during the study. 
Bulk tablet hold time studies for the 25 mg and 50 mg strengths, stored in the proposed commercial 
packaging components have been initiated, and the available data were submitted. The current available data 
are within the acceptance criteria with negligible changes in any finished product test attribute. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years, without special storage conditions, as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their manufacturing 
process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies related to primary and secondary pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology, 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions, distribution, excretion or environmental risk assessment with avapritinib 
have been provided. These investigations were submitted in the original application (Gastrointestinal Stromal 
Tumour indication). 
New studies submitted with this application pertain to: 
• 
• 
absorption and pharmacokinetic drug interactions of avapritinib.  
repeated dose toxicity studies, genotoxicity study and fertility. 
All analytical methods used were already validated in the original application of avapritinib, with no additional 
information in terms of matrix effect, selectivity, accuracy, precision, linearity, recovery dilution integrity, 
range, or limit of qualification. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
For the new indication (Systemic Mastocytosis), the MAH previously showed the pharmacological activity of 
avapritinib by inhibiting PDGFRa and KIT. In the case of KIT mutations (D816V), they have been identified 
with the pathogenesis of this new indication.  
In cellular assays, avapritinib inhibited the autophosphorylation of KIT D816V and PDGFRA D842V with IC50 
of 4 nM and 30 nM, respectively. In cellular assays, avapritinib inhibited the proliferation in KIT mutant cell 
lines, including a murine mastocytoma cell line and a human mast cell leukaemia cell line. Avapritinib also 
showed growth inhibitory activity in a xenograft model of murine mastocytoma with KIT exon 17 mutation. 
Reference is made to the published EPAR.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
New data related to absorption and pharmacokinetic drug interactions of avapritinib have been submitted in 
this procedure. No new data on distribution, metabolism or excretion were produced or incorporated. 
2.5.3.1.  Absorption 
Plasma determinations from rat fertility study (study 0124844), and chronic administration studies both in 
rats (study 00124815) and dogs (study 00124816) are summarized.  
In the fertility study, plasma levels (males only) of avapritinib were analysed on a daily basis for 9 weeks. 
Data reported on day 64 showed Cmax values of 644, 2620, and 8120 ng/mL for 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, 
respectively; and AUC(0-24) values of 9170, 49500, and 134000 ng.h/mL for 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. Peak concentrations were reported at 6, 12 and 3 hours, respectively for increasing dose levels. 
Half-life parameter could not be calculated due to limited data in the terminal phase.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 22/155 
 
 
The chronic repeat dose toxicity study in rats was conducted in male and female rats. They were daily dosed 
(oral gavage) for 6 months with avapritinib at 1, 3, or 10 mg/Kg/day. Data revealed accumulation after daily 
administration (day 1 vs. day 182), and higher levels in females than in males.  
In the 9-month repeat toxicity study, male and female dogs were administered with avapritinib at dose levels 
of 0.5, 1.5, or 5 mg/Kg/day. No accumulation was observed after chronic administration in dogs, with no sex 
differences in terms of exposure.  
2.5.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Avapritinib metabolism in pooled and single donor human liver microsomes,  Identification of the UGT 
enzymes involved in the metabolism of avapritinib hydroxylamine and  Drug transporter substrate 
identification. 
These in vitro studies related to metabolism of avapritinib complemented the previous information, and 
further characterised metabolic aspects. These studies showed that BLU-285 is catalysed in the presence of 
CYP3A5 (with no relation to the different genotypes *1*1, *1*3, *3*3). Also, in such studies it was found 
that avapritinib is metabolized to its hydroxylamine M514 first and subsequently M514 was metabolized 
either to the glucuronide conjugate M690 or to the oxidative deaminated product M499. Both metabolites had 
been previously identified in the original dossier as the major metabolites. The formation of these metabolites 
was found to be mediated by UGT1A3 and CYP3A4 (mainly), respectively. Finally, avapritinib did not appear 
to be a substrate for human transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, 
BCRP, P-gp, or BSEP 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Two additional GLP repeated dose toxicity studies, one genotoxicity study and one fertility study have been 
submitted. These studies encompassed chronic assessment in rats (6-month) and in dogs (9-months), a 
Comet assay in rats, while the reprotoxicity study was carried out in rats (fertility and early-embryonic 
development). 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
N/A 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
26-week (once daily) oral (gavage) toxicity study in sprague dawley rats with an 8-week recovery 
period: In this study, male and female rats were orally dosed with avapritinib (1, 3, or 10 mg/Kg/day) for 26 
weeks on a daily basis, followed by an 8-week recovery period. In addition to the standard endpoints (body 
weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology, necropsy findings, organ weights and 
histopathology), TK parameters were also analysed (as described in TK section). Microscopic changes at 
terminal necropsy were reported at different tissues and organs (adrenal gland, bone (femur), bone marrow 
(sternum), thymus, spleen, ovary, vagina, and prostate, most of them observed at 3 and 10mg/Kg/day dose 
levels). After considering all the findings reported, the MAH established the NOAEL value at 3 mg/Kg/day, 
corresponding to mean AUC0-t values of 9710 and 19,900 h•ng/mL and mean Cmax values of 622 and 1260 
ng/mL for males and females, respectively, on Day 182 (Week 26).

39-week (once daily) oral (gavage) toxicity study in beagle dogs with an 8-week recovery period: 
For this study, Beagle dogs were administered with avapritinib (oral gavage) at 0.5, 1.5, or 5 mg/Kg/day for 
39 weeks, followed by an 8-week recovery period. As in the case of rat study, TK parameters were also 
analysed (as described in TK section). Based on clinical observations, changes in serum chemistry and 
histopathologic findings at terminal necropsy the NOAEL value of the study was found to be 5 mg/Kg/day, 
corresponding to mean (sexes combined) AUC0-t of 7590 h•ng/mL on Day 273. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In vivo alkaline Comet assay in rat: The doses tested were 37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg/day for males and 25, 
50, 100 mg/kg/day for females. There was no mortality in this study, and no DNA damage was observed in 
the liver in the in vivo comet assay. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
N/A 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
An oral (gavage) study of the effects of avapritinib on fertility and early embryonic development 
to implantation in rats: In this study, male (3, 10 or 30 mg/Kg/day) and female (3, 10 or 20 mg/Kg/day) 
rats were treated (oral gavage) with avapritinib on a daily basis. Males received the test item for 28 days 
before mating until a minimum of 9 weeks, while females were dosed for 14 days before mating until 
gestation day 7. Based on the results from the study, it was concluded that the NOAEL for male reproductive 
toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for female reproductive toxicity 20 mg/kg/day. Based on effects 
on embryonic survival at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for early embryonic toxicity was considered to be 
3 mg/kg/day. 
Avapritinib partitioned into seminal fluids up to 0.5 times the concentration found in human plasma at 200 
mg. In female rats there was an increase in pre-implantation loss at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (12.6 times 
the human exposure at 200 mg) and in early resorptions at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg (6.3 times the human 
exposure at 200 mg) with an overall decrease in viable embryos at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg. Cystic degeneration of 
corpora lutea and vaginal mucification was also observed in female rats administered avapritinib for up to 6 
months at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.0 times the human exposure based 
on AUC at the 200 mg dose).”

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new data regarding environmental risk assessment of avapritinib have been submitted. 
In the initial application, the MAH estimated 14,200 patients to cover the targeted populations of ‘adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the PDGFRα D842V mutation, regardless of prior 
therapy’, and ‘adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST who have been treated with at least 3 prior 
lines of therapy’. A GIST prevalence of 2.8 in 10,000 people in the EU was considered for the calculations. 
The total number of GIST patients in the EEA (i.e. 145,600) was then reduced to approximately 9,000 
patients considering that patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours 
harbouring the PDGFRα D842V mutation are approximately 5-6% of all GIST patients. In addition, since no 
prevalence data on fourth line GIST is available, the MAH, based on the argumentation that treatment with 
regorafenib (third line) is less effective with few responders (less than 10%), proposed that the third-line 
GIST prevalence was suitable for the purpose of environmental risk analysis. This was estimated as 1 in 
100,000 in the UK, which in the EEA represents 5,200 patients. This proposed approach and related 
data/results were already assessed in the initial application. 
In the current line extension, the prevalence for AdvSM has been estimated as 0.1 in 10,000 people 
(conservative prevalence, based on Cohen et al 2014 and Schwaab et al 2020), resulting in 5,200 patients in 
the EU, considering population of 520 million people. As for the authorized GIST indication, the MAH used the 
prior calculation of 9,000 patients (see above). The total number of patients is therefore set at 14,200 
patients (5,200+9,000), which is the same number considered in the initial application.  
In essence, the PECsw value remained unchanged and below the action limit. The conclusion is that 
avapritinib does not to pose a risk to the environment following approval of the new proposed indication.   
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Avapritinib is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated. In the current line extension, the prevalence for AdvSM has been estimated as 0.1 in 
10,000 people (conservative prevalence, based on Cohen et al 2014 and Schwaab et al 2020), resulting in 
5,200 patients in the EU, considering population of 520 million people. As for the authorized GIST indication, 
the MAH used the prior calculation of 9,000 patients (see above). The total number of patients is therefore 
set at 14,200 patients (5,200+9,000), which is the same number considered in the initial application. 
Therefore, Avapritinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
The MAH has presented a new set of nonclinical data. This update included toxicokinetic analysis of chronic 
nonclinical studies, metabolic assays (drug interactions and transporters), an additional genotoxicity study, 
fertility assessment in male and female rats, and the results of the chronic administration of avapritinib in 
nonclinical species (rat and dog).  
Toxicokinetic analysis was done by using analytical methods already validated in the original application of 
avapritinib, with no additional information in terms of matrix effect, selectivity, accuracy, precision, linearity, 
recovery dilution integrity, range, or limit of qualification.  
The in vitro studies related to metabolism of avapritinib complemented the previous information, and further 
characterised metabolic aspects.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 25/155 
 
 
 
In the original application, avapritinib was tested in the standard battery for genotoxicity testing. It resulted 
negative in bacterial test and in non-mutagenic or clastogenic in vivo, although a positive result was 
observed in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay. Overall, it was considered as non-genotoxic. In the 
study submitted in the current procedure (in vivo alkaline assay), avapritinib resulted in no DNA damage in 
the liver in male and female animals administered.  
Given the adverse histopathological changes in the reproductive organ in rats and dogs, and pointing to the 
potential effects on male and female fertility, a fertility and early embryonic development study was 
conducted. No effects on fertility (reproductive performance, sperm parameters, oestrous cyclicity, or 
precoital intervals) were noted at the highest dose level tested (30 and 20 mg/Kg/day for males and rats, 
respectively). However, effects on implantation were reported at medium and highest dose levels, identifying 
the NOAEL value for early embryonic toxicity as 3 mg/Kg/day. 
In the case of the effects observed after chronic administration of avapritinib (6- and 9-month in rats and 
dogs, respectively), it is noted that they are not considered necessary for oncology indication, in accordance 
with ICH S9. The MAH conducted such studies for potential nononcology indications, which is not the case of 
the intended new indication (Systemic Mastocytosis). However, the results can be evaluated in view of any 
other potential new indications. Appropriate information has been included in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a nonclinical point of view, the new data do not modify the benefit risk assessment previously 
established in the original application of avapritinib. The new data cover some aspects that were not 
completely investigated, such as potential drug interactions or fertility. Also, an additional genotoxicity study 
was conducted. As for chronic administration of avapritinib, the MAH presented two chronic studies. They 
should be carefully considered in the case of non-oncologic indications. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical  Methods 
The analytical methods used in all three studies were previously assessed and found acceptable in a previous 
application (EMEA/H/C/005208). An addenda to the validation reports were provided to include new stability 
data, interference and concomitant medications and lipemic effect experiments. Both in-study validations 
show acceptable calibration standards and QCs. The reasons for the samples re-assayed are considered 
acceptable. Incurred Sample Reproducibility was performed and the reanalysis confirms the validity and 
performance of the Analytical Method Procedure for all analytes. 
All samples were analysed within the known stability period for BLU-285 (1774 days at -70 °C). The 
bioanalytical addendum containing additional stability data was submitted during the procedure. New 
information was provided by the MAH during the procedure, i.e. in the Validation addendum Report where the 
long term stability data of BLU111207 and BLU111208 were investigated. Data provided still do not cover the 
maximum storage time for the enantiomers in study BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202. Additional long term 
stability tests will be performed in first quarter (Q1) of 2023 to cover the maximum storage time for both 
studies (see also discussion section below). 
The bioanalytical report for the study BLU-285-2203 was submitted during the procedure. This was required 
as those study samples were used to support the application of the strength-based biowaiver. The in-study 
validation shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs. The reasons for the samples re-assayed are 
considered acceptable. Incurred Sample Reproducibility was performed and the reanalysis confirms the 
validity and performance of the Analytical Method Procedure for all analytes. 
Non-compartmental PK analysis 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 28/155 
 
 
 
Non-compartmental analyses were applied to report pharmacokinetic parameters of avapritinib and the 
metabolites BLU111207 and BLU111208 in study BLU-285-2101, using the pharmacokinetic R package 
maNCA. The package and associated code were run in R version 3.3. The following PK parameters were 
derived using NCA: Cmax, Cmax,ss,  Tmax, T24, AUClast, AUC0-24, AUClast,ss, AUC0-24,ss, C24, t1/2, CL/F, CL/Fss, Vz/F. 
Actual time points were used in the analysis. The AUC values were estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule 
(linear up-linear down). The terminal-phase disposition rate constant (λz) was estimated by linear regression 
of the terminal log-linear phase of the log-transformed concentration vs. time data, and t½ was estimated as 
ln(2)/λz. Apparent oral CL was estimated as dose/AUC0-∞, and Vz/F was estimated as dose/(AUC0-∞* λz).  
In study BLU-285-2203 Part 1, the PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analyses using 
Phoenix 32 Build 8.1.0. 
Bioavailability of capsules and tablets 
Two different formulations, drug-in-capsule not marketed and marketed tablets were used in the Phase 1 
study BLU-285-2101 where PK analysis was performed, merging the data irrespective of the formulation 
used. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the PK of avapritinib after single-dose administration of 
either 1 × 200 mg (commercial) tablet or 2 × 100 mg capsules in healthy subjects (Study BLU-285-0101), 
the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) values for Cmax and AUC parameters were contained within 
the equivalence limits of 80.00% to 125.00%, except for the lower bound for Cmax (78.5%). The 200 mg 
tablet and 2 × 100 mg capsule formulations of avapritinib were therefore considered to have similar 
bioavailability, and no dose adjustment was needed when switching from the capsule to the tablet 
formulation. It was concluded that no differences in exposure are expected between both formulations that 
would require any covariate effect in the population PK model. 
Absorption  
No new bioavailability studies were submitted. From the refined model, the bioavailability (F) in patients with 
AdvSM is estimated at 79.3% of the population estimated F in patients with GIST (i.e., ~20% lower).  
Distribution 
No new clinical distribution studies were submitted. Volume of distribution was estimated using the 
population PK approach. From the refined model, the population estimated apparent central volume of 
distribution (Vc/F) is 999 L. Population estimated mean volume of distribution of avapritinib at steady-state 
(Vss/F) is 1232 L at median lean body weight of 56.8 kg. 
Metabolism 
Incubations of avapritinib with NADPH-fortified HLM, recombinant human CYP3A4, or human hepatocytes led 
to the formation of its hydroxylamine metabolite M514, which was subsequently metabolized to either the 
glucuronide conjugate M690 or the oxidative deaminated product M499. The formation of these metabolites 
was found to be mediated by UGT1A3 and CYP3A4 (mainly), respectively. 
Elimination  
No new clinical elimination studies were submitted. Apparent clearance (CL/F) was estimated using the 
population PK approach. From the refined model, the population estimated mean apparent clearance (CL/F) 
of avapritinib is 16 L/h in GIST. Population estimated CL/F of avapritinib in AdvSM is 21.1 L/h at treatment 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

initiation, followed by a time-dependent decline towards 15.9 L/h after 15 days. This prediction is consistent 
with a time-dependent effect on CL/F in patients with AdvSM which is expected to reach a maximum at Day 
15, and that the steady-state CL/F of avapritinib in patients with AdvSM will be close to that in patients with 
GIST. Following single doses of AYVAKYT in patients with GIST and in patients with AdvSM, the mean plasma 
elimination half-life of avapritinib was 32 to 57 hours and 20 to 39 hours, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the initial MAA, dose proportionality was investigated and established over the range of 30 mg to 400 mg 
in patients with GIST. 
In the current application, two separate dose proportionality analyses have been conducted: (i) In patients 
with AdvSM using data from Study BLU-285-2101 (30 mg – 400 mg), and (ii) In patients with indolent 
systemic mastocytosis (ISM) or smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) using data from Study BLU-285-
2203 Part 1 (25 mg – 100 mg). The second analysis was used as a basis to support the biowaiver for the 
new tablet strengths 25 mg and 50 mg. 
Dose proportionality was assessed using the confidence interval criteria (power model).  
The steady state geometric mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC0-24 of avapritinib at 200 mg once daily was 377 ng/mL 
(62%) and 6600 h•ng/mL (54%), respectively. The geometric mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing 
(30-400 mg) was 2.6 to 5.8. 
Study BLU-285-2101 (AdvSM patients) - (30-400 mg): This open label, 2-part study, included a dose 
escalation (Part 1, n=32) and an expansion (Part 2, n=54). Patients in Part 1 received daily oral avapritinib 
starting doses of 30 mg (n=3), 60 mg (n=6), 100 mg (n=3), 130 mg (n=3), 200 mg (n=4), 300 mg (n=6), 
and 400 mg (n=7). Of the 54 patients receiving at least 1 dose of avapritinib in Part 2, 17 had a starting 
dose of 200 mg and 37 had a starting dose of 300 mg.  
Avapritinib Cmax and AUC0-24 at C1D1 and at steady state (C1D15) are summarised in Table 8 
The slope of the linear model for Cmax was 0.78 (90% CI 0.561 – 0.996) on C1D1 and 0.88 (90% CI 0.711 – 
1.05) on C1D15. Similarly, for AUClast the slope of the linear model was 0.78 (90% CI 0.563 – 0.989) on 
C1D1 and 0.90 (90% CI 0.723 – 1.08) for AUClast,ss on C1D15 (results not shown). The 90% CI for the slope 
were not within the abbreviated critical interval (0.732 – 1.27) except for Cmax,ss and AUClast,ss on C1D15.

Given the small number of subjects in the dose groups 30 mg – 130 mg (n=3-5) and the high variability, it 
was not possible to conclude dose proportionality. Subsequently, dose proportionality was conducted over the 
range 200 mg – 400 mg. A dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure to avapritinib was observed 
across the dose range after single-dose administration (C1D1) and at steady state (C1D15) for Cmax and 
AUClast. 
Study BLU-285-2203 Part 1 (25-100 mg) in support of biowaiver claim: Approximately 40 patients, 
diagnosed with ISM or SSM, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 doses of avapritinib (25, 50, and 100 mg) or 
to placebo. Plasma samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) of avapritinib were collected at the following time 
points at Day 1 (C1D1) and Day 15 (C1D15): Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. 
Avapritinib Cmax and AUC0-24 at C1D1 and at steady state (C1D15) are summarised in Table 9.  
For Cmax, the linear model had a slope of 1.15 (90% CI 0.854 – 1.44) on C1D1 and 0.95 (90% CI 0.665 – 
1.23) for Cmax,ss on C1D15. Similarly, for AUC0-24 the linear model had a slope of 1.14 (90% CI 0.901–1.38) 
on C1D1 and 0.98 (90% CI 0.704 – 1.26) for AUC0-24,ss on C1D15. The 90% CI for the slope of both PK 
parameters on both observation periods were within the pre-specified critical interval of 0.5 – 1.5, and dose 
proportionality of avapritinib was concluded over the dose rage 25 – 100 mg.

Time dependency: In the popPK model a time-dependent covariate effect was included on CL/F in AdvSM 
patients only. The maximum decrease in CL/F compared to healthy volunteers or patients with GIST was 
38.1%, and the time at half maximum decrease of CL/F was estimated to be 211 hours (9 days) since the 
first dose. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites: After single- and repeat-dose administration of avapritinib at doses of 30 to 
400 mg in patients with AdvSM in study BLU-285-2101, the interindividual variability for PK parameters 
generally ranged between 15% and 121% for Cmax, AUC0-24, and C24. In the popPK analysis, intra-individual 
variability on F (i.e. between-occasion variability) was estimated to a coefficient of variation (CV) of 25.1% 
and inter-individual variability in CL/F was estimated to a CV of 42.1%. Inter-individual variability in Vc and 
Vp was combined and estimated to a CV of 48%. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population: 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis (NCA) of avapritinib (BLU-285) and its Metabolites, BLU111207 and BLU111208 in 
Study BLU-285-2101 was performed.  A popPK model was provided in the initial application but was refined 
upon request from the CHMP. 
In the final model, compared with healthy subjects, patients with AdvSM have a lower overall exposure. In 
addition, patients with AdvSM appeared to have a time dependent decrease in CL/F. The additional covariate 
included in the final model were concomitant PPI use decreased KTR. The covariates that were identified in 
the previous model in patients with GIST (lean body weight on Vc/F and concomitant PPI use on F) were 
retained in the updated model, but with updated estimated values.  PvcVPCs were generated across 
subgroups (gender, race, PPI use) and indicated adequate predictive performance (not shown here). 
The model-predicted impact of patient population on the concentration-time profile is shown in the figure 
below.

The updated popPK model did only identify two covariates significantly impacting on avapritinib exposure: 
lean body weight on Vc/F and concomitant PPI use on F. Sex and race were no longer significant. The forest 
plots provided show that the range of lean body weights (30 kg to 80 kg) have modest impact on Cmax,ss 
(+/ 5%), while concomitant use of PPIs led to ~17% reduction in AUC and Cmax. The combination of high 
lean body weight and use of PPIs was predicted to reduce Cmax,ss by 19% and is thus of no increased 
concern than the use of PPIs alone. 
The updated popPK modelling data set included 323 males (66%) and 164 females (34%), and the updated 
modelling did not identify sex as a significant covariate on CL/F. The popPK dataset included mostly White 
subjects, with a low number of black (n=26) and Asian (n=25) subjects. Caution is advised when interpreting 
findings for these subgroups. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age (18-90 years), body weight (40-156 kg), and albumin 
concentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on both population and 
noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses for patients with GIST and AdvSM taking gastric acid reducing 
agents, the effect of gastric acid reducing agents on the bioavailability of avapritinib is not clinically relevant. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-efficacy  
The E-R efficacy analysis dataset included patients with AdvSM from Studies BLU 285 2101 and BLU-285-
2202 who had at least 1 prior systemic therapy.  
Best overall response: No clear relationship was evident between avapritinib exposure and BOR in the RAC-
RE population, while patients with stable disease in the PPRE tended to have lower Cave. 
Progression-free survival and duration of response: No clear relationship with avapritinib exposure were 
evident in the RAC-RE or PPRE population. 
Time to response: Higher Cave was significantly associated with faster response in the RAC-RE population. The 
probability of a confirmed response by 6 months in patients who responded was 0.33 in the 1st quartile of 
Cave (95% CI 0 to 0.70). Approximately ≥70% of patients in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of Cave with a confirmed 
response had responded by 2 months (first measure of efficacy). 
Exposure-safety 
The E-R safety analysis dataset included 144 patients with AdvSM from Studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-
2202, and 383 patients with GIST from BLU-285-1101 and BLU-285-1303, who had safety data and matching

avapritinib exposures. All E-R analyses for safety outcomes were conducted using the E-R safety analysis 
dataset, which constituted the E-R Safety Population. 
Grade 3+ adverse events: Approximately 56% of patients (n=296) experienced at least one Grade 3+ related 
AE  throughout  the  studies.  A  statistically  significant  relationship  was  evident  between  Cave  and  Grade  3+ 
related AEs, with patients who experienced an event having marginally greater Cave than patients who did not 
have an event. 
Cognitive  effects:  A  total  of  199  patients  (37.9%)  experienced  a  cognitive  effect  (pooled;  all  Grades). 
Avapritinib Cave was significantly greater in patients with a cognitive effect. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  analytical  methods  used  in  both  studies  were  previously  assessed  and  found  acceptable  in  a  previous 
application (EMEA/H/C/005208), and both in-study validations show acceptable calibration standards and QCs. 
However, concerns are raised regarding LTS experiments to cover at least the maximum sample storage period 
for both metabolites. The MAH agreed that additional long term stability tests will be performed in first quarter 
(Q1) of 2023 to cover the maximum storage time for both studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202. 
This grouped variation procedure includes an application for an extension of indication and also a line 
extension application to include two additional strengths 25 and 50mg. In order to demonstrate that the new 
strengths are bioequivalent to the currently approved strengths, the MAH has not submitted clinical 
bioequivalence studies, but instead presented a rationale for a strength-based waiver for the 25 mg and 50 
mg tablets. The CHMP Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**) 
lists general criteria that must be met for a strength-based biowaiver to be approvable. The MAH has 
demonstrated that these are met: i.e.: same manufacturing process, identical qualitative composition of the 
different strengths, quantitatively proportional compositions between the previously approved strengths and 
the two new strengths, and appropriate in vitro dissolution data. The MAH also showed that a dose-
proportional increase in systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of avapritinib was observed across the dose range 
of 25 to 100 mg (Study BLU-285-2203). Hence, a strength based biowaiver for the additional strengths of 
25 and 50 mg is acceptable. 
Dose proportionality data originally provided in the SmPC is following a single dose administration, while in 
AdvSM a more relevant exposure metrics would be steady-state exposure (avapritinib steady-state Cmax and 
area under the curve AUC, at C1D15) due to chronic administration. As seen in the results presented by the 
MAH (Table 8), steady-state Cmax and AUC of avapritinib increased proportionally over the dose range of 30 
mg to 400 mg. It was agreed that the steady state measures will be more informative for the AdvSM 
population. It was agreed to include the latter updated knowledge in the SmPC under Pharmacokinetics in the 
target population (Section 5.2). 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics in the target population have been characterized by assuming a similar 
population PK model as developed for GIST patients, showing minor concerns on the role of clearance values 
considered.  The  following  patient  characteristics  were  found  to  significantly  influence  avapritinib  PK  across 
indications:  lean  body  weight  on  volume  of  distribution  and  use  of  PPIs  on  bioavailability.  The  SmPC  was 
updated to reflect this information. The updated popPK modelling did not identify age as a significant covariate 
after investigation of a broad range of ages, which is in line with previous findings for avapritinib. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 34/155 
 
 
 
The exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety have not been reliably characterised for avapritinib 
in AdvSM due to shortcomings in the clinical data set in terms of sample size, exposure ranges represented 
and  clinical  dose  adaptations  that  limit  the  information  that  can  be  inferred  from  the  presented  analyses. 
Therefore,  the  uncertainties  regarding  the  optimal  avapritinib  dose  from  the  initial  application  in  the  GIST 
population  remain.  It  is  unknown  whether  a  lower  avapritinib  starting  dose  could  have  resulted  in  similar 
efficacy in AdvSM, but it is likely that the risk of AEs would be reduced.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Additional long term stability tests will be performed in first quarter (Q1) of 2023 to cover the 
maximum storage time for both studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The claimed indication in the current Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is for the use of avapritinib for 
the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  AdvSM,  including  ASM,  SM-AHN,  and  MCL,  after  at  least  one  systemic 
therapy. This application is based on the efficacy results from the ongoing phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 2-
cohort  study  BLU-285-2202  (PATHFINDER)  supported  by  the  phase  1,  open-label  dose  escalation  study 
BLU-285-2101 (EXPLORER). Both studies include patients with prior systemic therapy as well as treatment-
naïve patients.

Initial Scientific Advice from the CHMP regarding the SM program for avapritinib was received on 31 May 
2018 (procedure EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III). Later, Simultaneous National Scientific Advice was 
obtained from the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Products and the Norwegian Medicines Agency 
for a planned external-control, observational, retrospective study (BLU-285-2405). SA is further discussed 
under “The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice”. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study BLU-285-2101 is an ongoing, open-label, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
PK,  pharmacodynamics,  and  antineoplastic  activity  (efficacy)  of  avapritinib,  administered  orally,  in  adult 
patients with AdvSM and relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. As of the data cut-off date of 27 May 
2020, enrolment in the study is complete at 86 patients and patients remaining on study are being followed 
for response and safety assessments. 
The primary objective was to establish the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose.  
This 2-part study included: 
• 
an initial dose escalation (Part 1, complete) to evaluate safety and tolerability of increasing doses of 
avapritinib (from 30 to 400 mg QD) in patients with a local diagnosis of AdvSM or other relapsed or 
refractory myeloid malignancies,  
•  and  an  expansion  (Part  2,  ongoing)  to  further  evaluate  the  safety,  PK,  pharmacodynamics,  and 
efficacy  (according  to  mIWG-MRT-ECNM  response  criteria)  of  avapritinib  in  the  treatment  of  AdvSM 
when administered at starting doses of 200 or 300 mg QD.  
Part  2  enrolled  patients  with  a  WHO  diagnosis  of  AdvSM.  A  central  pathologic  review  was  implemented  to 
confirm diagnosis for all patients and to assess response for patients in Parts 1 and 2 of the study.

The primary objectives of Part 1 were to determine the MTD, RP2D as well as the initial safety and tolerability 
of avapritinib. Part 1 was designed to enroll patients with a local diagnosis of AdvSM or relapsed or refractory 
myeloid malignancy. Patients had a confirmed diagnosis of 1 of the following, based on WHO diagnostic criteria: 
•  ASM; 
•  SM-AHN and ≥ 1 C-finding attributable to SM. The AHN was to be myeloid, with the following exceptions 
that  were  excluded:  AML,  very  high-  or  high-risk  MDS  as  defined  by  the  IPSS-R,  and  Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive malignancies; 
•  MCL; 
•  Histologically or cytologically-confirmed myeloid malignancy that was relapsed or refractory to standard 
treatments  (excluding  AML,  very  high-  or  high-risk  MDS,  and  Philadelphia  chromosome-positive 
malignancies),  and  other  relapsed  or  refractory  potentially  avapritinib-responsive  hematologic 
neoplasms (eg, evidence of aberrant KIT or PDGFR signaling). 
A standard 3+3 dose escalation design was employed. The first cohort of 3 patients received avapritinib at a 
starting  dose  of  30  mg  QD.  Cohorts  were  expanded  to  include  6  patients  if  a  dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT) 
occurred,  with  replacement  of  non-evaluable  patients.  Additional  accrual  to  dose  levels  determined  to  be 
tolerable was allowed in enrichment cohorts. There were 32 patients enrolled in Part 1 of the study across 7 
dose cohorts. No DLTs were reported in the 30, 100, 130, 200, or 300 mg dose cohorts. 
The MTD was not reached up to doses of 400 mg QD, and doses above 400 mg QD were not evaluated because 
Study BLU-285-1101 in patients with GIST identified an MTD of 400 mg QD. In Study BLU-285-2101, the 400 
mg QD dose was not well tolerated long-term in SM patients, as evidenced by frequent dose reductions in later 
cycles. It was also noted that evidence of activity of avapritinib, based on decreases in MC burden, including 
BM MC, and serum tryptase, and reduction in spleen volume, were observed in the lower dose cohorts. 
Therefore, based on safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity, 300 mg QD was determined to be 
the RP2D for Part 2. Investigators initially were permitted to dose escalate patients stepwise (up to 400 mg 
QD) to potentially increase antitumor activity, provided the prior dose level was tolerated for ≥ 2 cycles (i.e., 
no treatment-related AEs Grade ≥ 3 were reported).

Table 11 
Part 2: Expansion 
Patients enrolled in Part 2 of the study had 1 of the following confirmed diagnoses based on WHO diagnostic 
criteria:  ASM,  SM-AHN,  or  MCL.  Patients  were  enrolled  based  on  local  diagnosis,  which  was  retrospectively 
confirmed by an independent central pathologist and central committee adjudication.  This confirmation was 
not required for study entry. 
At the initial Part 2 study design, groups of patients with specific target enrollment by AdvSM subtypes (ie, 
ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL) were defined and treated at the RP2D of 300 mg QD. 
Based on data demonstrating efficacy at all  tested dose  levels and emerging safety data showing improved 
tolerability at the 200 mg QD, a second expansion cohort (Cohort 2) with a starting dose of 200 mg QD was 
added in Part 2 enrolling patients with AdvSM (regardless of subtype) who had ≥ 1 measurable C-finding by 
mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria.  
This  change  was  introduced  with  Protocol  Amendment  6.  With  Protocol  Amendment  7,  all  patients  newly 
enrolling into Cohort 1 received a starting dose of 200 mg QD. 
As of the data cut-off date, 54 patients had been enrolled in Part 2 of the study (CSR BLU-285-2101). Of these, 
37  patients  received  avapritinib  at  the  RP2D  of  300  mg  QD  and  17  patients  received  avapritinib  at  a 
starting dose of 200 mg QD (in addition to the 4 patients enrolled in Part 1 of the study).

Results 
Overall, in the safety population (N=69: 8 ASM, 48 SM-AHN; 13 MCL), median (range) treatment duration was 
18.79 (1.0 to 50.6) months. Median (range) relative dose intensity was 62% (20% to 293%) in patients treated 
at all doses, 64% (20% to 139%) in patients treated  at 200  mg  QD, and  56%  (25%  to 106%) in patients 
treated at 300 mg QD. 
Overall,  the  ORR  (CR  +  CRh  +  PR  +  CI)  was  75.5%  (40/53),  which  was  higher  than  the  prespecified  null 
hypothesis of 28% (p <0.0001, Wald test). No patient had PD as their best response. Responses occurred in 
all subtypes of AdvSM. The CR + CRh + PR rate was 69.8% with 37 of 53 AdvSM patients achieving a best 
confirmed response of CR, CRh, or PR. The  CR +  CRh  + PR rate of 69.8% was significant compared to the 
prespecified null of 17% (p < 0.0001, Wald test).

treatment are eligible. 
o  MCL, including diagnoses with an AHN component. 
3.  Patients with SM-AHN should have received prior treatment for the AHN component of disease if, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, such therapy was appropriate. 
4.  Patient must have a BM biopsy taken within 56 days of C1D1, assessed by the Central Pathology Laboratory. 
5.  Cohort 1 only: Patient must have at least 1 of the following measurable C-findings, per modified IWG-

•  Treatments 
Avapritinib was administered orally, at a starting dose of 200 mg QD (Amendment 1), from D1 to D28 in 28-
day cycles. Dosing was continuous, with no inter-cycle rest periods.  
Initially, to manage thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk avapritnib was reduced to 100 mg QD for patients with 
platelet  counts  from  25,000  to  50,000/μL  at  baseline  (Amendment  3).  This  was  later  updated  to  exclude 
patients  with  platelet  counts  <50,000/μL  at  baseline  from  enrolment  (Amendment  5).  In  total,  2  patients 
received a starting dose of 100 mg QD. 
Avapritinib doses were administered with a glass of water (≥ 8 ounces or 250 mL) in a fasted state, with no 
food intake from 2 hours before until 1 hour after avapritinib administration. Each dose was administered at 
approximately the same time each day. 
Patients were instructed to not chew but swallow the tablets whole. Antacids were not to be taken  within 3 
hours before or after avapritinib administration. 
If a patient forgot to take a dose, he/she had to take it until 4:00 PM (morning dose schedule) or 12:00 AM 
(evening dose schedule) that day. If the dose was not taken by the specified time, then that dose was omitted, 
and the patient resumed treatment with the next scheduled dose. If the patient switched from a morning dose 
schedule to an evening dose schedule, he/she had to ensure the doses were taken ≥ 8 hours apart. If a patient 
vomited during or after taking avapritinib, redosing was not permitted and the patient should resume treatment 
with the next scheduled dose. 
•  Objectives 
Primary:  
To determine adjudicated ORR (CR+CRh+PR+CI) based on mIWG-MRT-ECNM consensus response criteria in 
patients with AdvSM treated with avapritinib and enrolled in Cohort 1. 
The ORR is tested for superiority versus midostaurin (see Statistical methods)

Key secondary:  
To assess mean change from baseline in AdvSM-SAF total symptom score (TSS) in patients in Cohorts 1 and 
2; 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: 
•  Adjudicated ORR (CR+CRh+PR+CI) based on mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, confirmed 12 weeks after initial 
response in patients in Cohort 1 only; 
Sensitivity analyses defined as secondary endpoints were conducted for ORR using algorithm-derived IWG-
MRT-ECNM  responses  and  investigator-assessed  responses  based  on  mIWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria,  and  for 
pathologic ORR using Pure Pathologic Response (PPR) criteria. 
Algorithm-derived IWG-MRT-ECNM responses were based on a computer algorithm that derived responses 
per the original, published IWG-MRT-ECNM without modifications. The computer algorithm used the same 
source data as the SSC, including adjudicated diagnosis by SSC. 
Morphologic response by PPR criteria proposed by the SSC were used for all patients with measurable MC 
burden. PPR was derived by a computer algorithm using the same assessments that were used for mIWG-
MRT-ECNM derivation and additionally KIT D816V Mutant Allele Fraction by central assay. The PPR criteria 
define  responses  as  a  direct  measure  of  the  disease  burden.  The  PPR  criteria  are  a  modification  of  the 
mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria and focus on objective changes (bone marrow MC burden, serum tryptase, and 
complete blood count). 
This study was the first to use the IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, and some issues were identified that led to 
modification  of  the  published  criteria,  leading  to  the  modified  IWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria  as  shown  in  the 
following table:

•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This  is  an  open-label,  single-arm  study  with  no  randomization  or  stratification  and  no  blinding.  All  eligible 
patients  who  consented  to  participate  and  were  enrolled  in  the  study  received  avapritinib.  Patients  were 
assigned to 1 of the 2 cohorts based on SSC confirmation of eligibility by mIWG-MRT-ECNM and AdvSM subtype. 
•  Statistical methods 
A  pre-planned  interim  analysis  for  superiority  against  the  null  hypothesis  of  ORR  28%  was  conducted  to 
determine whether avapritinib is effective in treating patients with AdvSM. Analyses are presented by starting 
dose  of  200  mg  QD  and  all  doses  for  the  safety  population  and/or  by  disease  subtype  for  RE  (Response 
evaluable) and PPRE (Pure pathologic response-evaluable) populations. 
The  null  hypothesis  was  generated  using  midostaurin  ORR  of  28.3%  by  IWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria  (Rydapt 
2017b). With the initial application only results of the interim analysis as of data cut-off date of 23 June 2020 
were  submitted.  Additional  data  were  however  submitted  later  during  the  procedure  from  a  later  cut-off 
(additional 10 months of follow up, DCO date of 20 April 2021) and including additional patients.  
Disease subtypes are presented separately for Investigator-reported diagnosis and SSC-determined disease 
diagnosis. 
Analyses of demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior therapies for the underlying malignancy 
were performed for all 3 analyses populations. 
Efficacy  data  presentation:  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  analysis  is  presented  for  RE  population,  with 
sensitivity analyses performed in both the RE and PPRE populations. All other secondary/exploratory efficacy 
endpoints analyses were performed for the RE population, PPRE population, and/or the safety population. The 
primary endpoint was SSC-adjudicated ORR (CR+CRh+PR+CI) based on mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, a modified 
version of the original, published IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria that were modified in consultation with experts and 
regulatory authorities.  
The key secondary endpoint as well as secondary analyses of bone marrow mast cells, serum tryptase, KIT 
D816V  MAF,  spleen  and  liver  measurements,  PGIS,  EORTC  QLQ-C30,  and  all  exploratory  endpoints  are

presented for the safety population. Time to event analyses, DOR, and PFS are presented for RE population, 
with sensitivity analyses performed in RE and PPRE populations. 
Overall  survival  is  presented  for  both  safety  and  RE  populations.  Event-free  survival  is  presented  for  RE 
population. Subgroup analyses are presented for RE population (ORR, DOR, and PFS) and for safety population 
(OS). 
Summary statistics for continuous variables included n (non-missing observations), mean, StdDev, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Summary statistics for categorical variables were presented in terms of frequencies 
and percentages. Time to event data were summarized and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, including 
the estimated median with 95% confidence intervals, and 25th and 75th percentiles. 
Unless otherwise specified, baseline was defined as the last observation before first dose date of avapritinib, 
including predose assessments on the first dose date. 
Sample size 
The sample size of approximately 63 patients in Cohort 1 was estimated based on the primary objective and 
was intended to provide 93.5% power at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025 for testing the assumption of 
the null hypothesis ORR of 28% vs the alternative ORR of 50%. 
Enrolment of the SM-AHN subgroup was capped at 70% of 63 patients (ie, maximum of 45 patients) to ensure 
the study population reflects the general AdvSM patient population. 
This sample size also allowed statistical testing of the key secondary objective and was intended to provide > 
90% power at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025 for testing the assumption of the null hypothesis mean 
change of TSS ≥ 0 vs the alternative mean change of TSS ≤ −10. All treated patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 
2 were included in the analysis. Testing for this key secondary endpoint was sequential to ensure control of the 
study wise type I error rate (ie, it was only performed when the null hypothesis for the primary objective was 
rejected). 
The non-mIWG-MRT-ECNM evaluable cohort (Cohort 2) of approximately 40 patients, for a total of 103, was 
intended for an approximate 88% probability of observing ≥ 1 AE at 2% frequency, instead of 3.5% frequency 
with 60 patients. 
Interim analysis 
As per Protocol, an interim analysis was planned once the first 32 patients (with the SM-AHN subgroup capped 
at  approximately  70%)  were  enrolled  in  the  mIWG-MRT-ECNM-evaluable  cohort  and  were  evaluable  for 
response. The results initially presented for this submission were those corresponding to the interim analysis, 
DCO date 23 June 2020.  
The final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was planned to occur after all 63 patients (with the SM-AHN 
subgroup capped at approximately 70%) were enrolled in the cohort 1 and have had the opportunity to receive 
avapritinib treatment for at least 10 cycles or had discontinued treatment earlier, and was to be tested at a 1-
sided alpha level of 0.02178.  
Analysis Populations – Data Sets Analysed 
The following analysis populations were defined as follows: 
•  Safety Population: All patients who received ≥ 1 dose of avapritinib; 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 59/155 
 
 
•  Response-evaluable  (RE)  Population:  All  patients  who  received  ≥  1  dose  of  avapritinib,  were  deemed 
evaluable per mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria at baseline as assessed by SSC review, and had 1 of the following 
conditions: 
− ≥ 2 complete postbaseline bone marrow assessments, and had been on study for ≥ 6 cycles (6 x 28 
days); 
− had an EOS Visit; 
• 
Pure Pathologic Response-evaluable (PPRE) Population: All patients who received 
-  ≥ 1 dose of avapritinib, and had 1 of the following conditions: 
−  ≥ 2 complete postbaseline bone marrow assessments, and had been on study for ≥ 6 cycles (6 x 
28 days); 
− had an EOS Visit. 
The safety population was used for the key secondary analysis and all safety analyses, patient reported outcome 
analyses, and efficacy analyses that are not based on mIWG-MRT-ECNM response criteria.  
The RE population was used for the primary efficacy analysis and for all secondary efficacy analyses 
related to response, such as objective response, time to response, DOR, PFS, CI rate, and clinical benefit 
rate. 
The PPRE population was used as analysis population for PPR, such as objective response rate, time to 
response, DOR, and PFS. 
Results 
Results from the pre-planned IA, DCO date of 23 June 2020, for 32 response evaluable patients (23 having 
received at least one systemic therapy, which corresponds to the target indication) were initially presented in 
the application. 
During the procedure, updated efficacy data from study BLU-285-2202 were submitted from a later data cut-
off (20 April 2021) including additional RE patients (post IA population), i.e. up to 47 patients having 
received prior systemic therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg QD of avapritinib, who are considered the 
primary efficacy population in the context of the applied indication. Data/results from this subset of patients 
are presented below.

•  Recruitment 
•  Date first patient enrolled (C1D1): 21 November 2018 
•  Date last patient enrolled (C1D1) for the interim analysis: 17 June 2020 
•  Data cut-off date for the interim analysis: 23 June 2020 
•  Data cut-off date for the updated analysis: 20 April 2021 
•  Date last patient enrolled in the study: 21 January 2021 
At the time of data cut-off, 18 sites enrolled patients and entered data, including 10 sites in North America 
(1 site in Canada and 9 in the United States) and 8 sites in Europe (3 in Germany, 1 in Italy, 1 in Norway, 1 
in Poland, 1 in Spain and 1 in the UK).  
At the time of the initial DCO, enrolment was still ongoing. Data from additional patients were submitted during 
the procedure. 
•  Conduct of the study 
•  Protocol amendments  
•  There were a total of 10 amendments to the original Protocol (09 January 2018). Amendments 1, 3 
and 5 referred to changes in the starting dose of avapritinib. The recommended Phase 2 dose was 
initially identified as 300 mg QD, which was finally not selected given the observed higher toxicity and 
lower tolerability. With Protocol Amendment 1, the starting dose of avapritinib was reduced from 300 
mg to 200 mg QD  with no patient  in study BLU-285-2202 enrolled under  the  initial  protocol. With 
Protocol Amendment 3, a 100 mg QD starting dose was permitted for patients with platelet counts 
from 25,000 to 50,000/μL at baseline. However, with Protocol Amendment 5, patients with platelet

counts <50,000/μL at baseline were excluded from enrolment. Amendments 1, 3, 5, 7, and 7.1 were 
incorporated  globally.  All  patients  contributing  data  to  analyses  in  this  CSR  were  enrolled  under 
Protocol Amendment 1 or later. The amendments to the protocol do not seem to adversely affect the 
interpretability of the study. 
• 
•  Protocol deviations  
•  No patient was excluded from any analysis population as a result of a protocol deviation. 
•  The  observed  protocol  deviations  were  considered  unlikely  to  affect  the  study  efficacy  or  safety 
conclusions.

The assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint was based on a total of 47 AdvSM patients, evaluable 
according to the modified IWG-MRT-ECNM response criteria, enrolled in the study, who received at least one 
prior systemic therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg AYVAKYT once daily with 78.7% of patients having 
received prior midostaurin, 17.0% prior cladribine, 14.9 % prior interferon alpha, 10.6% prior 
hydroxycarbamide and 6.4% prior azacytidine. Thirty seven (79%) out of the 47 patients with 
AdvSM who received at least one prior systemic therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg AYVAKYT 
had one or more dose reductions during the course of therapy with a median time to dose

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
Overall Response Rate by Centrally Adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM Criteria  
The ORR (CR+CRh+PR+CI) by centrally adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria was 59.6 % (95% confidence 
interval:  44.3, 73.6) in all AdvSM patients in the RE  population having  received prior systemic therapy and 
treated with a starting 200 mg QD dose (see table above), with 28 of the 47 evaluable patients achieving a 
best confirmed response of CR (1), CRh (4), PR (19), or CI (4). The ORR was statistically significant compared 
to the prespecified null hypothesis of 28% (p < 0.0001, Wald test). One patient achieved a CR as of the time 
of data cut-off (20 April 2021), and 4 (8.5%) patients achieved a CRh. Responses occurred in all subtypes of 
AdvSM. The ORR was 62.5% and 65.5% in patients with ASM (5 of 8 patients) and SM-AHN (19 of 29 patients),

respectively.  The  ORR  in  the  MCL  group  was  40%,  based  on  3/10  MCL  patients,  who  showed  PR,  and  one 
patient achieving best response of CI. 
The CR+CRh+PR rate by centrally adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria was 51.1% (95% confidence interval: 
36.1, 65.9) in patients with AdvSM treated at all doses in the RE population, with 24 of 47 patients achieving 
a  best  confirmed  response  of  CRh  or  PR.  This  was statistically  significant  compared  to  the  prespecified  null 
hypothesis of 17% (p < 0.0001, Wald test). Responses occurred in all subtypes of AdvSM.

Key Secondary Endpoint 
Total Symptom Score (TSS) 
As shown in the figure below (DCO date 20 April 2021), in patients with a starting dose of 200 mg QD, the 
mean (StdDev) TSS score at baseline was 17.60 (11.81) out of 80 maximal points (10 points per symptom), 
where  0  represents  absence  of  symptoms  and  80  the  most  severe  symptom  experience.  In  patients  on 
treatment for >10 cycles, mean change in AdvSM SAF TSS from baseline to C11D1 was statistically significant 
(p < 0.001) with a mean reduction from baseline of –-6.07 points (95% confidence interval: –9.45 to –2.69). 
A  decrease  on  C11D1  was  also  seen in  the  skin  and  GI  domains  as  well  as  the  symptoms  abdominal  pain, 
nausea, spots, itching, flushing, fatigue, diarrhoea count, and diarrhoea severity.

Time to Response 
Median (range) time to response  (TTR) by  centrally  adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria in the  28  AdvSM 
responders treated in the 200 mg QD group in the previously treated RE population was rapid and occurred at 
1.94 (0.5, 12.2) months. 
Responses deepened over time. 
Median (range) time to CR+CRh (5 patients) was 3.71 (1.8, 14.8) months.  
Median time to response was similar in patients with ASM, SM-AHN, but median time to response and CR + 
CRh  +PR  was  slightly  longer  for  MCL,  the  more  aggressive  disease  subtype  with  a  higher  MC  burden  (3.6 
months and 5.59 months respectively).

Progression-free Survival 
In the RE population of patients who had received prior systemic therapy and were treated with an avapritinib 
starting dose of 200 mg QD, 35 of 47 patients (74.5%) were censored for the analysis and 12 (25.5%) had a 
PFS event (DCO date 20 April 2021). Median PFS by centrally adjudicated mIWG MRT ECNM criteria in the 47 
AdvSM patients was NE at the time of data cut-off (95% confidence interval: 17.5, NE). The estimated PFS 
rate was 87.2% at 3 months and 65.5% at 24 months. Median PFS was not reached in any disease subtype.

Overall Survival 
Most AdvSM patients (91.9%) in the safety population were alive at the time of data cut-off (Table 24). Kaplan-
Meier  estimate  for  median  OS  could  not  be  determined  (NE  [95%  confidence  interval:  NE,  NE]).  The 
estimated OS rate was 94.1% at 6 months and 86.2% at 9 and 12 months. Median (range) OS follow-up 
duration was 7 (5.6 to 8.1) months. Overall survival was similar among patients with ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL. 
In the RE population, with a median follow up of 14.6 months, 36 (76.6%) of the 47 patients who had received 
prior systemic therapy and were treated with an avapritinib starting dose of 200 mg QD were alive at the time 
of the DCO (20 April 2021). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for proportion of AdvSM patients alive were 82.7% at 
12 months and 67.8% at 24 months.  
Median OS follow-up was longer in RE patients with SM-AHN (17.8 months; 95% confidence interval: 13.2, 
20.7) and MCL (14.6 months; 95% confidence interval: 11.1, 17.9) who had received prior systemic therapy 
as compared to patients with ASM (8.6 months; 95% confidence interval: 7.3, 16.9,).

Change in Bone Marrow Mast Cells 
The mean (StdDev) percentage of BM MC at baseline in the 65 patients who had received prior systemic therapy 
and were treated with an avapritinib starting  dose  of 200 mg QD  in the Safety population who had BM  MC 
measurements at baseline was  51.2%  (26.92, 20 April 2021). A  total  of 54 (83.1%)  patients in the Safety 
population (200 mg) had a ≥ 50% reduction in BM MC and 38 (58.5%) patients had complete elimination of 
BM MC aggregates. Of the 54 patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in BM MC 36 (55.5%) patients sustained the 
decrease for ≥ 2 consecutive biopsies (20 April 2021). Results were generally similar between ASM and SM-
AHN patients and lower for MCL patients.  
Over time, bone marrow response deepened. By the time of the first bone marrow biopsy on C3D1, 41.2% of 
patients had CR in bone marrow while by C7D1, 55.3% of patients who reached that time point had a bone 
marrow CR. Patients with ASM and SM-AHN had deeper responses compared with MCL patients. 
Change in Serum Tryptase Level 
The mean (StdDev) serum tryptase at baseline in the 67 patients who had received prior systemic therapy and 
were treated with an avapritinib starting dose of 200 mg QD in the Safety population was 338.4 μg/L (259.68) 
(20  April  2021).  A  total  of  59  (88.1%)  patients  had  a  ≥ 50%  decrease  in  serum  tryptase  and  43  patients 
(64.2%) had sustained the decrease for ≥2 cycles (20 April 2021). In 34 (49.3%) patients, serum tryptase 
level was reduced to < 20 ng/mL. A total of 64 patients with AdvSM had baseline serum tryptase ≥40 ng/mL. 
Of  those  56  (87.5%)  patients  had  ≥50%  reduction  in  serum  tryptase  from  baseline,  41  (64.1%)  patients 
sustained the decrease for ≥2 cycles, and 31 (48.4%) had reduced serum tryptase <20 ng/mL. Results were 
generally similar between ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL patients (20 April 2021).

The mean (StdDev) KIT D816V MAF at baseline in the 67 patients with AdvSM who had received prior systemic 
therapy and were treated with an avapritinib starting dose of 200 mg QD in the Safety population was  20.4 
(16.67). Of the 67 patients with a baseline assessment in blood, 46 (68.7%) patients had a ≥ 50% decrease 
and  28  (41.8%)  sustained  the  decrease  for  ≥2  cycles.  Thirteen  (19.4%)  patients  had  a  reduction  to  MAF 
< 0.17% and 24 (35.5%) patients had a decrease to < 1%. A total of 57 patients with AdvSM had baseline 
assessments of MAF ≥ 1% in blood, of those, 16 (28.1%) had a reduction to MAF < 1%. A total of 41 (71.9%) 
patients had ≥ 50% reduction in MAF from baseline and 26 (45.6%) patients sustained the decrease for ≥ 2 
cycles. Results were generally similar between ASM and SM-AHN patients and lower for MCL patients. 
Responses deepened over time, with 52.2% of patients with KIT D816V MAF experienced a ≥ 50% reduction 
from baseline by C3D1. 
Change in Spleen and Liver Volume 
Mean (StdDev) spleen volume at baseline in 65 AdvSM patients who had received prior systemic therapy and 
were  treated  with  an  avapritinib  starting  dose  of  200  mg  QD  in  the  Safety  population  and  who  had  spleen 
measurement  at  baseline  was  968.03  mL  (582.831).  A  total  of  39  of  the  65  (60.0%)  AdvSM  patients  with 
baseline spleen volume assessments and 11 of the 20 (55.0%) AdvSM patients with baseline spleen palpation 
≥ 5 cm had ≥ 35% spleen volume reduction from baseline. Of the 34 AdvSM patients with palpable spleen at 
baseline, the spleen became non-palpable in 23 (67.6%) patients. Results were generally similar between ASM, 
SM-AHN, and MCL patients.  
Patient-reported Outcomes 
Results included below correspond to patients enrolled in study BLU-285-2202 following prior systemic therapy 
(AdvSM/safety population, all doses). Patient’s Global Impression of Symptom Severity 
Mean (StdDev) PGIS score in AdvSM patients treated in the safety population decreased (improved) from 2.6 
(1.11) out of 4 maximal points at baseline to 0.9 (1.00) points at C17D1, where 0 represents no symptoms 
and 4 very severe symptoms.  
Decreases were reported over the entire course of the study. Results were generally similar among patients 
with ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL. 
Among patients with a baseline PGIS score greater than the median, a greater improvement of the score was 
noted compared with all patients. 
Quality of Life Assessment 
Mean (StdDev) global health status score in all AdvSM patients in the safety population improved from 37.90 
(24.549) out of 100 maximal points to 59.72 (18.060) points at C17D1, where 0 represents low quality of life 
and  100 high  quality  of  life.  Increases  were  reported  over  the  entire  course  of  the  study  (Table  35.2.11.1, 
attached) 
Results were generally similar among patients with ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL. 
Among  patients  with  baseline  values  below  the  median,  a  greater  improvement  of  the  score  was  noted 
compared with all patients (Figures 35.2.11.2 and 35.2.11.2a, attached).

Results included below correspond to data from response evaluable patients enrolled in study BLU-285-2202 
following prior systemic therapy (200 mg starting dose) based on the 20 April 2021 data cut-off date. 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  ORR  by  prior  midostaurin  treatment,  baseline  S/A/R  genotype,  age 
group, sex, and geographic regions. Subgroup analyses used centrally adjudicated data by mIWG-MRT-ECNM 
criteria. 
Overall  there  are  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  ORR  between  the  respective  subgroups.  The  95% 
confidence intervals were generally wide and overlapping. See table below.

Primary ORR analysis was based on SSC 
adjudicated responses in the RE Population. 
ORR was estimated using frequency, 
percentage, and two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals based on the exact binomial 
distribution (Clopper-Pearson). Statistical test 
on binomial proportion against a null of 28% 
were performed using one sided α=0.025. Wald 
test p-value was presented.  
There is one interim analysis when 32 patients

Pathologic ORR is defined as the proportion of 
patients with a confirmed best response of 
morphologic CR (mCR), morphologic CRh 
(mCRh), or morphologic PR (mPR) by PPR 
criteria. Pathologic ORR is analyzed in the PPRE 
Population and RE Population. Pathologic ORR is 
estimated using frequency, percentage, and 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals based on 
the exact binomial distribution (Clopper-
Pearson). 
Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time 
from the start of treatment to the time a 
response (CR/CRh/PR/CI) by mIWG or PPR 
criteria is first met. Patients without confirmed 
response are excluded from this analysis. 
Time to CR is defined as the time from the start 
of treatment to the time a CR/CRh by mIWG is 
first met. Patients without confirmed CR/CRh 
are excluded from this analysis. 
DOR is defined as the time from first 
documented response (CR/CRh/PR/CI) to the 
date of first documented PD/LoR or death due 
to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses 
are determined by mIWG or PPR criteria.

Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
The primary efficacy analysis of ORR by mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria is primarily 
based on assessment of resolution of evaluable organ damage (C-findings). 
Therefore, enrolled AdvSM patients must be assessed by central review as 
having one or more baseline evaluable C-findings (except for MCL, which is 
evaluable regardless of C-findings). In addition, patients must have sufficient 
follow up for response assessment, which is on study for 6 months (with at 
least 2 post-baseline marrow assessments) or off study. These patients are 
the Response Assessment Committee-Response Evaluable (RAC-RE) 
population. 
Patients were analyzed according to AdvSM disease subtype and the starting 
dose. Other secondary/exploratory efficacy endpoints analyses were 
performed for the RAC-RE population, AdvSM PPRE population, and/or the 
safety population.

BLU-285-2405 
Study Design 
Study BLU-285-2405 was designed as an external control, observational, retrospective study to compare the 
effectiveness of avapritinib in patients treated in studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202 and real-world 
patients treated with Best Available Therapy (BAT). The primary endpoint was OS, while secondary endpoints 
included: duration of therapy (DOT), change in serum tryptase from baseline to two months and the 
maximum reductions in serum tryptase. Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint of OS were conducted in 
patients who initiated avapritinib at dose ≤200mg compared to patients who received BAT as 1L+, in 
patients who initiated avapritinib at a ≤200 mg dose compared to all patients who received BAT, in the 2L+ 
setting; and in patients who received avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg QD in both trials compared to 
all patients who received BAT in the 2L+ setting.  
Individual patient-level data for the BAT cohort were collected retrospectively up to October 4, 2021, from 
the medical charts of adult patients with AdvSM, who received systemic treatment at participating study sites 
in Europe and the US on or after January 1, 2009. The avapritinib cohort consisted of patients treated with 
avapritinib in studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202, at any dose, included in the data cut as of April 20, 
2021.  
Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
assess the association between receiving avapritinib vs. BAT and outcomes of OS and DOT, adjusting for 
differences in key covariates defined a priori, between the two treatment groups. Key covariates included, 
but were not limited to, age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, number of prior lines of 
therapy (LOTs), and types of prior therapy.  
Results 
Primary Analysis  
Overall, 176 patients from studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202 in the avapritinib cohort and 141 real-
world patients in the BAT cohort were included in the comparative analysis. Patients in the BAT cohort could 
have received multiple LOTs at participating sites, and data on all eligible LOTs was collected, therefore the 
141 patients in this cohort contributed data on 250 LOTs. Among 196 LOTs with agent-level information 
available, midostaurin and cladribine were the most commonly used, representing 50.5% and 25.0% of these 
LOTs, respectively. Of note, midostaurin was only approved for treatment of AdvSM in 2017. Other 
treatments included TKIs (ripretinib (2.0%), ibrutinib (1.5%), dasatinib (1.0%), and imatinib (1.0%)), 
cytotoxic treatments (hydroxyurea (8.7%) and azacitidine (1.5%)), and biologics (interferon-alpha (5.6%), 
pegylated interferon (4.1%), brentuximab vedotin (2.0%), and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (0.5%)). 
Based on an unweighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis, median OS was not reached (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 46.9, not estimable [NE]) for the avapritinib cohort and was 23.4 months (95% CI: 19.5, 32.6) for the 
BAT cohort (log-rank P<0.001). In the IPTW-weighted, adjusted analysis, OS was improved in the avapritinib 
cohort compared with the BAT cohort (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 0.48 [0.29, 0.79]; P=0.004), after 
adjustment for key covariates. Similar results were obtained in the subgroup analyses (see table below).

Table 37 Summary of Overall Survival in Patient Subgroups 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH applied for the addition of two new strengths (25mg and 50 mg film-coated tablets) and for a new 
therapeutic  indication.  This  new  claimed  indication  is  for  the  use  of  daily  avapritinib  200  mg,  administered 
orally in 28 day-cycles, for the “treatment of adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM), 
including aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological 
neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy”. 
This application is based on the efficacy results from the ongoing phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 2-cohort 
study BLU-285-2202 (PATHFINDER) and supported by the phase 1, open-label dose escalation study BLU-
285-2101  (EXPLORER)  as  described  below.  Both  studies  were  conducted  in countries  in  Europe  and  North 
America. Data of study BLU-285-2202 (PATHFINDER) in the initial submission came from a pre-specified interim 
analysis (n=32 in the mIWG-MRT-ECNM-evaluable cohort 1). 
Results from these two studies, and from a pooled analysis including patients previously treated with at least 
one systemic therapy and who have received various avapritinib starting doses (ranging from below 200 mg 
to  400  mg)  were  the  initial  basis  proposed  to  support  efficacy  (and  safety)  of  avapritinib  in  the  intended 
indication.  Differences  were  noted  in  the  baseline  characteristics  and  prognostic  factors  in  the  relevant 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

populations (200mg, focus on 2L+), which constitutes an important drawback of this pooled analysis. Efficacy 
data from the pooled analysis are therefore not presented in this report. 
Additionally, results from  a Real-World Evidence (RWE) trial (study BLU-285-2405) designed as an external 
control,  observational,  retrospective  study  assessing  the  effect  of  avapritinib  compared  with  best  available 
therapy (BAT) for patients with AdvSM have been provided during this procedure.  Inclusion of these RWE data 
in the SmPC is however not accepted. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose response study 
Study BLU-285-2101 (EXPLORER) is an ongoing, open-label, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antineoplastic activity (efficacy) of avapritinib, administered orally, in 
adult patients with AdvSM and relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. As of the data cut-off date of 27 
May  2020,  enrolment  in  the  study  was  complete  at  86  patients  and  patients  remaining  on  study  are  being 
followed for response and safety assessments. Its primary objective was to establish the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose.  
The BLU-285-2101 two-part study included: 
• 
an initial dose escalation (Part 1, complete) to evaluate safety and tolerability of increasing doses of 
avapritinib (from 30 to 400 mg QD) in patients with a local diagnosis of AdvSM or other relapsed or refractory 
myeloid malignancies,  
• 
and  an  expansion  (Part  2,  ongoing)  to  further  evaluate  the  safety,  PK,  pharmacodynamics,  and 
efficacy  (according  to  mIWG-MRT-ECNM  response  criteria)  of  avapritinib  in  the  treatment  of  AdvSM  when 
administered at starting doses of 200 or 300 mg QD. 
The recommended Phase 2 dose was initially identified as 300 mg QD; however, based on efficacy, time to 
response, and long-term safety and dosing data from the Phase 1 study (BLU-285-2101), a starting dose of 
200  mg  QD  was  selected.  Therefore,  a  dose  of  200  mg  QD  was  used  in  the  BLU-285-2202  study  for  the 
treatment of patients with AdvSM. This is considered acceptable, although the trial design limits the possibility 
to quantify how the risk potentially changes in relation to different dose- and exposure levels. The 3+3 design 
with the allowance of intrapatient dose increases, and abundant dose modifications, makes it difficult to assess 
any relationship between dose and response. For efficacy, relationships cannot be determined since patients 
were not kept at lower dose levels for sufficient periods to assess objective responses at the actual starting 
dose  levels.  The  separate  exposure-efficacy  analyses  (presented  in  3.3.2  Pharmacodynamics)  are  also 
inconclusive. 
A total of 53 patients from BLU-285-2101 study were considered as response evaluable for the pooled efficacy 
analysis initially provided, of whom 32 received prior systemic therapy and 9 were treated with a starting dose 
of 200 mg QD (DCO 27 May 2020). Of note, three additional patients previously treated with systemic therapy 
and receiving a starting dose 200 mg QD became RE at a later DCO of 20 April 2021. 
Main clinical study  
Study  BLU-285-2202  (PATHFINDER)  is  an  ongoing,  open-label,  single-arm,  Phase  2  study  evaluating  the 
efficacy and safety of avapritinib 200 mg QD in patients with a WHO diagnosis of AdvSM, who were enrolled 
into 1 of 2 cohorts: 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 88/155 
 
 
•  Cohort  1:  patients  with  ≥  1  mIWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria  for  evaluable  disease  (with  an  evaluable  C-
finding or MCL), as determined by the Study Steering Committee (SSC). 
•  Cohort 2: patients who were not considered eligible for an adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM response, 
as determined by the SSC. 
At the first data cut-off date the study was ongoing with 62 patients across both cohorts having received ≥ 1 
avapritinib dose through the data cut-off of 23 June 2020 (safety population). Screening in study BLU-285-
2202 was completed on 17 Nov/2020, with the last patient enrolled on 21 Jan/2021.  
Patients in Cohort 1 support the primary objective of determining SSC-adjudicated ORR by mIWG-MRT-ECNM 
criteria (primary endpoint). The RE population was used for the primary efficacy analysis and for all secondary 
efficacy  analyses  related  to  response.  Data  from  both  cohorts  were  used  in  the  analyses  of  the  remaining 
secondary and exploratory endpoints.  
During the study a total of ten amendments to the original protocol (09 January 2018) were issued. A number 
of  deviations  were  also  noted,  primarily  due  to  the  large  number  of  assessments  required  to  adjudicate 
response by mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the amendments to and 
deviations from the protocol do not seem to adversely affect the interpretability of the study. 
As mentioned, no patient in study BLU-285-2202 received a starting dose of 300 mg QD. There were two 
patients who received 100 mg as an initial dose at the time of the interim analysis data cut-off. Of the two 
patients, one met the criteria for response evaluable population and was included in the primary analysis. This 
patient never received a 200 mg dose during following cycles. The patient was continuing on 100 mg at the 
time of the data cut-off (20 April 2021, cycle 26) with ongoing CI (TTR 5.8 months) and DOR of 15.7 months. 
In addition, one patient who received a starting dose of 100 mg became response evaluable at the time of the 
most recent data cut-off (20 April 2021).  
The  proposed  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  considered  overall  acceptable.  Of  note,  with  the 
exception  of  study  sites  in  Germany,  midostaurin-naïve  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study  based  on 
encouraging results from study BLU-285-2101 where the majority of patients were midostaurin-naïve as study 
BLU-285-2101 was initiated before the approval of midostaurin. In study BLU-285-2202, 9 patients, out of the 
32 response evaluable patients at the time of the IA, were treatment naïve. None of them had a clear absolute 
or relative contraindication to midostaurin, as reported by the MAH following a review they conducted on data 
available from patients (the specific information was not recorded in the CRFs).  
The  primary  endpoint  in  the  study  is  adjudicated  ORR  (CR+CRh+PR+CI)  based  on  mIWG-MRT-ECNM 
response criteria, confirmed 12 weeks after initial response, which is considered an acceptable primary endpoint 
in the context of a single arm trial, indicating drug activity. The use of the modified IWG-MRT-ECNM response 
criteria  was  discussed  and  agreed  at  the  time  when  scientific  advice  was  sought.  Inclusion  of  clinical 
improvement,  in  line  with  what  was  done  in  the  midostaurin  trials,  was  also  agreed  at  that  time  and  is 
considered acceptable.  
The IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria were used for the first time in BLU-285-2101, and based on this experience, the 
applicant modified the IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria to construct the mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria. The modified criteria 
have  not  been  published,  although  requested  at  the  time  when  SA  was  sought.  The  main  difference  in the 
mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria compared to the original was the revision and expansion of the definition of a C-
finding, which likely led to the inclusion of a larger patient population compared to the patient group that would 
have  been  eligible  according  to  the  original  IWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria.  This  could  lead  to  an  observed 
enhancement  of  effect  compared  with  evaluation  by  IWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria.  The  applicant  has  provided 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 89/155 
 
 
sensitivity  analyses  with  the  IWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria  to  address  this  issue  (data  not  shown).  Another 
modification in the mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria was the introduction of the CRh (Complete remission with partial 
recovery  of  peripheral  blood  counts)  response  category,  which  required  the  absence  of  neoplastic  MC 
aggregates, serum tryptase < 20ng/mL, complete resolution of all evaluable C-findings, partial hematologic 
recovery with ANC≥0.5x109/L, Hgb≥8g/dL and Platelets≥50x109/L. In the SA it was stated that this response 
should be considered in the category of partial response and not be taken into account as a CR. 
Overall, in the absence of a RCT, an indirect comparison of ORR rates in the precedent midostaurin study and 
BLU-285-2202, although not exempt from limitations, does provide information about avapritinib efficacy. In 
this regard, the validity of comparing ORR for the current study, assessed by the mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, 
against ORR for midostaurin, assessed by the unmodified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, was questioned, and for a 
better  comparison,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  an  analysis  where  the  response  for  avapritinib  treated 
patients  was  assessed  according  to  similar  unmodified  IWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria.  The  MAH  provided  the 
requested analyses (data not shown) of ORR for avapritinib compared to the ORR observed for midostaurin, 
i.e. 28%, using unmodified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria. Again, ORR for avapritinib was found to be statistically 
significantly  superior  to  an  ORR  of  28%.  While  it  is  necessary  to  recognize  that  midostaurin  is  an  external 
control group and the results of this comparison should be interpreted with caution, the comparison seems 
overall favourable for avapritinib. 
Secondary endpoints include among others: time to event outcomes (including time to response, DOR, PFS, 
and OS) as well as changes in bone marrow mast cells and serum tryptase which are related to disease activity. 
All are considered reasonable. Of particular relevance in the context of the conducted single arm trial is the 
duration of response (DOR) as it provides relevant information on the clinical value of the achieved responses.  
From a methodological perspective the targeted sample size of 63 patients in cohort 1 can be considered 
adequate also taking into account that AdvSM is a very rare disease. At the time when scientific advice was 
sought (EMEA/H/SA/3738/2/2018/SME/III) the CHMP expressed concerns regarding the intended sample size  
of only 60 patients, especially since three different disease entities with different prognosis are included. The 
MAH increased the target for enrolment in study BLU-285-2202 (up to 103 patients, approximately 63 patients 
in cohort 1 and 40 patients in cohort 2) but only cohort 1 will provide data on the primary endpoint of ORR 
based on mIWG-MRT-ECNM response criteria. As reported above, study enrolment completed with a total of 
107 patients enrolled, including 85 (74 currently RE) in Cohort 1 and 22 in Cohort 2. 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) is dated 29th June 2020, whereas the data cut-off date is 23rd June 2020: 
the statistical analysis plan was therefore finalised after the data cut-off date. Ideally in an open label study 
(with confirmatory intent) the SAP should have been finalised before.  
An interim analysis was planned and added to the protocol as part of amendment 3, to be conducted once 
the first 32 patients (with the SM-AHN subgroup capped at approximately 70%) were enrolled in the mIWG-
MRT-ECNM-evaluable cohort and were evaluable for response. Only ORR results (primary efficacy endpoint) 
from the 23 previously treated patients (out of the 32 patients evaluable for response at the time of the IA) 
were initially considered for efficacy evaluation together with data from additional patients in study BLU-285-
2101. Additional data was however submitted during the procedure as reported below. 
RWE study 
Study BLU-285-2405 was designed as an external control, observational, retrospective study to compare the 
effectiveness of avapritinib in patients treated in studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202 and real-world 
patients treated with BAT. Individual patient-level data for the BAT cohort were collected retrospectively up 
to October 4, 2021, from the medical charts of adult patients with AdvSM, who received systemic treatment

at participating study sites in Europe and the US on or after January 1, 2009. The primary endpoint was 
overall OS, while secondary endpoints included: duration of therapy, change in serum tryptase from baseline 
to two months and the maximum reductions in serum tryptase (data for secondary endpoints not shown). 
Subgroup analyses were performed, reflecting the indication and posology applied for. The final CSR for this 
study was submitted during the procedure. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study BLU-285-2202 
The updated dataset (DCO date of 20 April 2021) included 42 additional response evaluable (RE) patients 
from study BLU-285-2202 so that the current sample size is more than double of the previous submitted IA-
population. The combined IA  and post IA population (n=74 patients, 49 received at least one prior systemic 
therapy) showed a slightly lower ORR in both subpopulations compared to that reported in the initial submission 
(ORR 67.6% vs. 75% in the “Regardless of prior systemic therapy population” / ORR 59.2% vs. 73.9% in the 
“After at least one prior systemic therapy population”), with a median follow-up of 14 months which remains 
short particularly for the post-IA population where median follow is 9.6-9.9 months. The lower response rate, 
in  spite  of  similar  follow-up  time,  reported  in  the  post-IA  population  compared  to  the  initially  reported  IA 
population, in patients who received at least one prior therapy (46.2% vs. 73.9%), is explained by the MAH as 
being  driven  by  fewer  CI  responses  but  with  a  similar  rate  of  deeper  responses  (CR/CRh/PR),  i.e.  38.4% 
vs.43.4%. This is acknowledged though it should also be noted that a lower number of CRh is also reported 
(13% in the IA population vs. 3.8% in the post-IA population). In addition, the point estimate in the IA analysis 
falls outside the 95% CI in the post-IA population. The lower limit of the confidence interval is also clearly lower 
in the 2L+ post-IA population, extending down to 26.6%. Patient numbers are, however, small and follow-up 
too short to conclude on whether these differences are of concern. Overall,  the updated data from the BLU-
285-2202 study supports previously reported results from the IA population. 
Median  (range)  time  to  response  by  centrally  adjudicated  mIWG-MRT-ECNM  criteria  in  the  24  AdvSM 
responders treated in the all doses group in the RE population, initial dataset, was rapid and occurred at 2.04 
(0.3 to 12.2) months. 
Median DOR by centrally adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria in the 24 AdvSM responders treated in the all 
doses group in the RE population was not reached at the time of data cut-off (nor for the updated analysis). 
Median PFS was also not reached at the time of data cut-off (nor for the updated analysis), with an estimated 
PFS rate of 78.3% at 12 months (combined IA and post-IA population, patients having received at least one 
prior therapy, DCO date 20 April 2021). OS at 12 months was 87.3% (combined IA and post-IA population, 
DCO date 20 April 2021).  
Efficacy data for the 3 subdiagnoses of AdvSM have also been presented for the 200mg, 2L+ RE population 
(n=47) which is considered the main efficacy population in the context of the applied indication. Data/results 
for this subset of patients are presented in the efficacy section of this report and are reflected in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC instead of the originally proposed pooled analysis. There are 8 patients with ASM, 10 patients with 
MCL and 29 patients with SM-AHN in the updated analysis. The numbers of patients are still very low especially 
for  ASM  and  MCL.  From  the  results  in  the  subgroups,  it  may  however  be  concluded  that  clinically  relevant 
response  can be obtained  with  avapritinib  in  all  subgroups,  although  MCL  seems  to  be  the  most difficult  to 
treat.

Results from secondary endpoints, albeit exploratory, can be considered to support the reported ORR findings. 
Of special relevance are data on DOR which are critical to judge the expectation of a reported very high ORR 
to translate into clinically meaningful benefit. Follow-up is limited and, as noted, median DOR is still not reached 
with a median updated follow–up of 14 months, which remains limited particularly in the newly enrolled patients 
/ post-IA patient population.  
Besides data being currently immature, interpretation of time to event endpoints, in particular PFS and OS, is 
hampered in the context of a single arm trial and should therefore be considered with caution.  
Results  on  other  secondary  endpoints  e.g.  the  observed  reduction  of  bone  marrow  mast  cells  and  changes 
observed in serum tryptase level are also encouraging. Both endpoints are related to the level of disease activity 
with maintenance of observed reductions over time associated with control of the disease.  
Notwithstanding the above outlined limitations, it can be concluded that clinically relevant responses can be 
obtained  with  avapritinib treatment  in  AdvSM  patients  after  at  least  one  systemic  therapy  and  in  whom  an 
improvement in symptoms and control of the disease can be considered to represent clinical benefit. Provision, 
post-approval, of the final CSR of study BLU-285-2202, for further confirmation of currently reported results 
and of long-term benefit is in any case expected (REC). 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  ORR  by  prior  antineoplastic  therapy,  prior  midostaurin  treatment, 
baseline S/A/R genotype, age group, sex, and geographic regions (data presented in this report corresponds 
to the original dataset). The submission of results from subgroup analyses is acknowledged. However, given 
the  low  numbers  results  from  these  analyses  are  difficult  to  interpret.  Of  note,  according  to  the  submitted 
subgroup analysis by prior midostaurin treatment, patients previously treated with midostaurin seem to have 
better outcomes that those who did not received previous treatment with midostaurin though the 95% CIs are 
wide and overlapping.  
No dedicated studies have been conducted in special populations: elderly patients and patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment. However, 67.7% of patients from the safety population (n=62) of the main study (BLU-
285-2202) were 65 years old or older. The MAH has included information in the SmPC, i.e. of the percentages 
of patients above 65 years of age and 75 years and older among patients who received avapritinib (all doses) 
and  who  received  at  least  one  prior  systemic  therapy  in  EXPLORER  or  in  PATHFINDER  highlighting  that  no 
overall differences in efficacy were observed between these patients and younger adult patients.  
RWE Study: BLU-285-2405 
Analysis of the primary endpoint, OS, showed improved OS for avapritinib compared to BAT (HR [95% CI]: 
0.48 [0.29, 0.79]; P=0.004), after adjusting for differences in key prognostic factors and confounders between 
the  patients  who  received  avapritinib  in  clinical  trials  and  patients  who  received  BAT  in  real-world  practice. 
Subgroup analyses agreed with the primary analysis. In particular, the subgroup of patients who received an 
avapritinib starting dose of 200mg in 2L+ had a 63% decreased risk of death (adjusted HR  [95% CI]: 0.37 
[0.18, 0.75]; P=0.006) compared to BAT patients in 2L+. However, there are several limitations to study BLU-
285-2405 and these analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution. For one, BLU-285-2405 was not 
able  to  fully  recapitulate  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  from  BLU-285-2101  and  BLU-285-2202.  Further, 
AdvSM diagnoses for the avapritinib cohort were centrally confirmed, while diagnoses in the BAT cohort were 
not. In BLU-285-2405, patients were included from January 1, 2009. Treatment options for advanced systemic 
mastocytosis have improved during this time, most notably through the introduction of Rydapt (midostaurin) 
in 2017. Thus, though median OS appears better for avapritinib than for BAT in BLU-285-2405, it cannot be 
concluded from the study whether avapritinib also gives better median OS than midostaurin, which has shown 
good results in patients with AdvSM. Further possible biases in BLU-285-2405 may arise from the censoring of 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

Page 92/155 
 
 
patients  upon  starting  avapritinib  treatment  and  from  the  inclusion  of  several  lines  of  therapy  from  some 
patients, though sensitivity analyses to assess these two issues show results consistent with the main analysis. 
Overall,  study  BLU-285-2405  provides  some  support  for  an  improved  median  OS  in  the  avapritinib  cohort 
compared with the BAT cohort, bearing in mind that there are several uncertainties surrounding study BLU-
285-2405 and the comparison between BLU-285-2405 and BLU-285-2101/BLU-285-2202. 
Wording of the indication  
A  slight  rewording  of  the  indication  was  proposed  for  clarity.  This  was  accepted  by  the  MAH  and  the  final 
indication reads:  
 “AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic 
mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) or mast 
cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy” 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data submitted to support the new claimed indication for avapritinib come from two uncontrolled 
single arm studies where a relevant ORR by centrally adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria in patients with 
aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm 
(SM-AHN) and mast cell leukaemia (MCL) after at least one systemic therapy, have been reported. These 
ORR results, which are supported by secondary endpoints, including duration of response, are expected to 
translate into clinically meaningful benefit, and appear to be rather consistent regardless of prior systemic 
therapy, subtype of the disease and starting dose cohort, though data are limited. A number of 
methodological limitations are identified that are considered to be outweighed by the relevance of the 
reported efficacy results in the context of a very rare disease with limited treatment alternatives. Even if 
follow-up time is limited, particularly for the post-IA population, currently available updated efficacy data 
show that clinically relevant responses can be obtained with avapritinib treatment in AdvSM patients after at 
least one systemic therapy in whom an improvement in symptoms and control of the disease can be 
considered to represent clinical benefit. Final data from study BLU-285-2202 (CSR), anticipated to be 
available in December 2026, will be submitted as a post-authorization commitment (REC). 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety database to support this indication expansion consists of 2 studies in patients with AdvSM (studies 
BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202) and updated safety data from 2 studies in patients with GIST (studies BLU-
285-1101 and BLU-285-1303). Safety data from these 4 studies were pooled for analysis (Table 1). Several 
other ongoing and completed avapritinib studies were considered out of scope for the integration of safety data 
into pooled analyses, including 5 clinical pharmacology studies (all subjects were healthy volunteers), study 
BLU-285-2203  (ongoing  Phase  2  study  in  ISM  using  smaller  doses  of  avapritinib),  an  EAP,  and  data  from 
individual patients treated under a CUP. 
Data presented with the initial submission included events occurring up to 27 May 2020 for Studies BLU-285-
1101, BLU-285-1303, and BLU-285-2101, and through 23 June 2020 for BLU-285-2202, the data cut-off 
dates for this marketing application. During the procedure, the MAH provided a safety update for studies 
BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202, with a cut-off date of 21 Apr 2021. Pooled safety data were also updated

and provided. For some of the analyses concerning the 200mg QD group (also referred to as “extended” or 
“overall” group), separate data for the 81 original patients were also provided at the CHMP’s request.

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In  the initial  submission,  a  total  of  148  AdvSM  patients  across  all doses  of  avapritinib  were  included in  the 
Safety Population. Of them, 81 patients received a starting dose of 200 mg QD, 50 patients received a starting 
dose of ≥ 300 mg QD, and 17 patients received a starting dose of < 200 mg QD. Studies BLU-285-2101 and 
BLU-285-2202 contributed 86 and 62 AdvSM patients, respectively to the Safety Population. 
During the procedure, the MAH provided an integrated analysis of safety with a data cut-off date of 20 April 
2021. The updated safety population included 193 patients (i.e., extended population) that had received 
avapritinib in studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202, including 126 patients who initiated treatment with 
avapritinib at 200 mg once daily (QD) and 50 patients who initiated dosing at ≥ 300 mg QD.  
•  Disposition 
A total of 193 AdvSM patients received ≥ 1 dose of avapritinib as of 21 April 2021. Overall, 99/126 (78.6%) of 
patients starting with avapritinib 200mg QD continued on treatment. The updated patient disposition is shown 
in the table below.

Table 39 Updated patient disposition as of 21 April 2021 
•  Study Drug Exposure 
In the original submission, median treatment duration for the all-doses safety population (n=148) was 41.29 
(range: 0.9 to 220.0) weeks for all AdvSM patients (n= 148) treated at all doses of avapritinib, with 39.2% 
having been exposed to avapritinib for > 56 weeks.  
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  indicated  that  median  treatment  duration  for  the  all-doses  safety 
population (n=193) was 60.29 weeks (range: 0.9-266.9). Median duration in the 200mg QD group (n=126) 
was  41.00  (0.9  to  188.1)  weeks  for  patients  with  AdvSM  treated  at  200  mg  QD,  with  42.9%  having  been 
exposed  to  avapritinib  for  >  56  weeks.  As  expected,  due  to  the  addition  of  new  patients  in  the  200 mg 
“extended” group (that included the original 81 patients and the new patients), the median duration for the 81 
original patients in the 200mg QD group was slightly higher (67.14 week, range: 0.9-188.1).  
Most recent patient exposure data are shown in table 12, below.

In  the  Updated  Safety  Population  (all  doses),  159 of  the  patients  (82.4%)  with  AdvSM  had  ≥ 1 dose 
modification  129 patients  (66.8%) had  ≥ 1 dose  interruption  due  to  an  AE,  and  140 patients  (72.5%)  had 
≥ 1 dose  reduction  due  to  an  AE.  In  the  200mg  QD  group,  the  proportion  of  patients  requiring  ≥ 1 dose 
modification/interruption was slightly lower (Table 41). 
There were no meaningful differences in dose modifications between the 200 mg QD original group and 200

•  Demographics and other characteristics of the study population (Safety population) 
Demographics and Baseline disease characteristics 
Among  the  126 patients  with  AdvSM  treated  at  200 mg  QD,  74 were  male  (58.7%)  and  52 were  female 
(41.3%). Median (range) age was 68.0 (31 to 88) years, with 37.3% of patients < 65 years of age (Table 42). 
Most patients self-identified as white (86.5%) and not Hispanic or Latino (85.7%). 
A  total  of  52.4%  of  patients  with  AdvSM  treated  at  200 mg  QD  had  received  prior  midostaurin.  In 
Studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202, 79 patients had prior antineoplastic therapy and 46 had not.

Most  patients  with  AdvSM  treated  at  200 mg  QD  (96%)  had  a  baseline  platelet  count  ≥ 50,000/µL  during 
screening. 
Demographics in the overall population were comparable to those of the 200mg QD group. (Table 42). 
There were no meaningful differences in demographics and baseline characteristics between the 200 mg original 
and the 200 mg extended groups.

Adverse Drug Reactions 
A comprehensive approach was undertaken to identify potential adverse drug reactions for avapritinib to be 
used in the proposed product label. Medical review of the AEs reported for patients with AdvSM who received 
treatment with avapritinib was performed with a focus on events assessed as related to study treatment (as 
assessed by the investigator). PTs that represented the same or a similar medical concept were grouped as 
appropriate. In addition, events that may be related to nonclinical findings were assessed for plausibility as 
adverse drug reactions. 
A summary of related AEs (as assessed by the  Investigator) by PT reported in ≥ 10% of AdvSM patients is 
provided in table 34.

Deaths 
Table  37  provides  a  summary  of  AEs  leading  to  death  for  all  patients  in  the  Safety  Population.  Overall,  15 
patients (7.8%) treated with avapritinib died during the studies due to AEs. Most deaths were related to the 
patients’ underlying disease.  
Eight (6.3%) patients with AdvSM who initiated  treatment at 200 mg QD  died during the study due to AEs 
compared with 6 patients (12.0%) who initiated treatment at ≥ 300 mg QD. In the 200 mg group, no patients

died due to a related AE compared with 1 patient in the ≥ 300 mg QD group. The single fatal event that was 
assessed as avapritinib-related was a case of intracranial bleeding.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
• 
Intracranial Bleeding 
Intracranial bleeding is an important identified risk in avapritinib-treated patients.  
In the overall clinical development of avapritinib, the incidence of intracranial bleeding was considerably higher 
in patients with AdvSM treated at all doses (updated data: 6.2%, initial submission: 7.4 %) than in patients 
with GIST treated at all doses (updated data: 2.1%, initial submission: 1.8 %, SmPC: 1.7 %) (Table 11). Most 
of the intracranial bleeding events in avapritinib-treated patients (76.0%; 19 of 25 events) were serious, and 
36% (9 of 25 events) were Grade 1 in severity. The majority of the intracranial bleeding events resolved or 
resolved with sequelae (88%; 22 of 25 events). 
Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to resolution demonstrated that, for  patients with AdvSM treated at all doses 
who experienced Grade ≥ 2 intracranial bleeding, the probability of resolution was 25% by 2.4 weeks and 50% 
by 8.1 weeks

a  A discrepancy in the number of intracranial bleeding events for GIST patients was noted. An additional event of 
nonserious haemorrhage intracranial Grade 2 was captured in the safety database which was not reflected in the clinical 
database or in the source tables listed below. Numbers shown in the table above include this patient. 
During Study BLU-285-2101, a significantly higher frequency of intracranial bleeding events was observed in 
AdvSM patients initiating treatment at the 300 mg dose (16.0 %, n = 8) as compared with GIST patients (1.8 
%), most of whom were treated at ≥300 mg.  
With  all  risk  minimization  measures,  at  the  data  cut-off  date  (27  May  2020/23  June  2020)  for  the  initial 
application the intracranial bleeding incidences in AdvSM patients in the 200 mg group were overall 3.7 % (n 
= 3) and 2.6 % (n = 2) when patients with pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia were excluded.  With the 
most recent data cut-off date (April 2021), the corresponding incidences were 3.2 % and 2.5%, respectively.

No notable differences in the frequency of intracranial bleeding events were seen through the update period 
compared to what was reported in the initial application. One patient in study BLU 285-2202 had an ICB (grade 
3  haematoma)  following  the  original  data  cut-off  dates.  This  patient  initiated  at  200  mg,  experienced  on-
treatment severe thrombocytopenia and interrupted dosing; however, the event was confounded by accidental 
head trauma and concomitant use of aspirin.  
Kaplan-Meier analyses of TTO of any grade of intracranial bleeding for all patients with AdvSM are summarized 
in figure below:

A  side-by-side  comparison  of  intracranial  bleeding  AEs  reported  in  the  200  mg  original  group  and  200  mg 
extended group is provided in Table 53. There were no meaningful differences in the incidences of intracranial 
bleeding AEs between both groups. Pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia was present in an equal proportion 
of patients experiencing intracranial bleeding events in the 200 mg original group and in the 200 mg extended 
group (Table 54).

The updated data are consistent with what was presented in the initial submission, and the incidence of ICB 
appear to be reliably constant in the 200 mg group. The estimates of the incidence of this important safety 
issue are considered to be acceptably accurate.  
•  Cognitive Effects 
A systematic approach was used by the MAH in the identification of cognitive effects events comprising the 
AESI of cognitive effects. Based on this methodology, the current PTs comprising the AESI cognitive effects are 
as follows: Memory impairment, Cognitive disorder, Confusional state, Amnesia, Somnolence, Speech disorder, 
Delirium,  Hallucination,  Mood  altered,  Agitation,  Personality  change,  Dementia,  Mental  status  changes, 
Psychotic disorder, Disorientation, Mental impairment, and Encephalopathy. 
Among the 193 patients with AdvSM, 59 patients (30.6%) experienced cognitive effects (Table 55). The most 
commonly reported event was memory impairment (14.5%), followed by cognitive disorder (14.0%). Thirty-
five patients (18.1%) reported Grade 1 events, 17 patients (8.8%) reported Grade 2 events, and 7 patients 
(3.6%) reported Grade 3 events, which according to the CTCAE definition had clinical relevance (eg, interfered 
with  activities  of  daily  living  or  self-care);  ≥Grade 4  events  were  reported.  Five patients  (2.6%)  reported 
cognitive effects that led to permanent discontinuation of avapritinib (Table 55). 
Of the 59 patients who experienced cognitive effects, 5 patients reported serious cognitive effects. Confounders 
for serious cognitive effects were reported in all 5 patients and included advanced age > 70 years in 3 patients; 
a  history  of  psychiatric  conditions  or  insomnia  in  4 patients;  and  psychiatric  or  opioid  medication  use  in 
5 patients. 
In general, the incidence of cognitive effects was lower in the AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg QD compared 
with  AdvSM  patients  treated  at  ≥ 300 mg  QD,  largely  attributed  to  the  differences  in  exposure  and  in  its 
duration (41 weeks vs ~96 weeks, respectively) which was supported by findings in the exposure-response 
analysis, that included data from patients with AdvSM or GIST (original submission). In addition, with longer 
treatment durations the probability of experiencing a cognitive effect event increases, see figure below:

Source: Updated Figure 99.2.1.1.1 
The median time to occurrence of cognitive effects was 12.1 weeks and 13.3 weeks for the 200 mg and ≥ 300 
mg groups, respectively. There are cases of cognitive effects reported later then 24 months, which is important 
information to convey.  
Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to improvement (defined as a reduction from Grade ≥ 2 to Grade < 2) showed 
that, for patients with AdvSM treated at all doses who experienced Grade ≥ 2 cognitive effects, the probability 
of  improvement  was  50%  by  8.0 weeks  and  75%  by  24.1 weeks.  For  patients  treated  at  200 mg  QD,  the 
probability of improvement was 50% by 6.1 weeks and 75% by 9.1 weeks. 
Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to resolution demonstrated that, for patients with AdvSM treated at all doses 
who experienced Grade ≥ 2 cognitive effects, the probability of resolution was 25% by 5.4 weeks and 50% by 
13.1 weeks.  For  patients  at  200 mg  QD,  the  probability  of  resolution  was  50%  at  6.1 weeks  and  75%  at 
9.1 weeks.  
The majority of AdvSM patients with cognitive effects events continued treatment with avapritinib, with only 
2.6% of all AdvSM patients and 1.6% of patients who initiated treatment at 200 mg experiencing cognitive 
effects leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

A higher proportion of patients in the 200 mg original group experienced AEs in the SOC of General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions compared to those in the 200 mg extended group (Table 57). This increase 
was primarily driven by higher incidence of peripheral edema (51.9% vs 42.9%) and fatigue (19.8% vs 16.7%) 
in the original 200 mg group as compared to extended 200 mg group, respectively.

Original 200 mg safety population from initial submission (data cut-off date 20 April 2021) 
Updated safety population (data cut-off date 20 April 2021) 
•  Gastrointestinal Disorders  
In  AdvSM,  mast  cells  can  accumulate  in  the  GI  tract  and  GI  symptoms  are  expected.  Nausea,  diarrhea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, and gastric hemorrhage are  commonly reported in patients with AdvSM (Jensen, 
2000). 
Overall,  161 of  the  patients  with  AdvSM  treated  at  all  doses  (83.4%)  experienced  AEs  in  the  SOC  of 
Gastrointestinal  Disorders;  the  most  common  AEs  were  diarrhoea  (34.7%),  nausea  (31.1%),  vomiting 
(26.4%), constipation (17.6%), and abdominal pain (16.6%). 
Regarding intensity,  
In this SOC, the majority of patients experienced grade <3 AEs (n=124, 64.3%). 
A total of 31 patients (16.1%) experienced SAE in this SOC, most commonly ascites (3.1%), gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage (2.1%), abdominal pain, gastric haemorrhage, and vomiting (1.6% each), and intra-abdominal 
haemorrhage, large intestine perforation, pancreatitis, and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (1.0% each). 
Three patients  died  due  to  an  AE  in  this  SOC  (gastric  haemorrhage,  gastritis  erosive,  and  intra-abdominal 
haemorrhage), none of them were considered treatment-related. 
A  total  of  30 patients  (15.5%)  experienced  AEs  in  this  SOC  that  led  to  dose  interruption,  most  commonly 
vomiting (2.6%), ascites (2.1%), gastrointestinal haemorrhage and nausea (1.6% each). 
A total of 15 patients (7.8%) experienced AEs in this SOC that led to dose reduction, most commonly diarrhoea 
and nausea (2.1% each), ascites and vomiting (1.6% each). 
The most common AEs, related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to dose interruption or reduction experienced by 
patients with AdvSM treated at 200 mg QD were similar to those experienced by patients with AdvSM treated 
at all doses. 
•  Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders  
Anemia,  leukopenia,  and  other  cytopenias  are  features  of  AdvSM  resulting  from  dense  mast  cell  infiltrates 
within  the  bone  marrow  (Pardanani  2016)  and  expected  toxicities  of  avapritinib  related  to  on-target  KIT

inhibition  (Demetri  et  al,  2002;  Gleevec,  2016).  These  findings  are  generally  manageable  with  supportive 
treatment  and/or  dose  interruption/reduction  when  related  to treatment  and may  improve  as  the  mast  cell 
burden decreases. 
Overall, 144 (74.6%) of the patients treated at all doses experienced AEs in this SOC. The most common AEs 
were  anaemia  (47.2%),  thrombocytopenia  (39.9%),  and  neutropenia  (18.7%).  Regarding  intensity,  91 
(47.2%) patients experienced grade ≥ 3; the most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 events were anaemia (23.8%), 
thrombocytopenia  (15.0%),  and  neutropenia  (10.9%).  The  most  common  (≥ 5%)  Grade 4  event  was 
thrombocytopenia (7.3%) and neutropenia (5.2%).  
A total of 12 patients (6.2%) experienced SAEs in this SOC, most commonly anaemia (4.1%). No patient died 
due to an AE in this SOC. 
A  total  of  59 patients  (30.6%)  experienced  AEs  in  this  SOC  that  led  to  dose  interruption,  most  commonly 
thrombocytopenia (15.5%), neutropenia (8.8%), anaemia (8.3%). A total of 63 patients (32.6%) experienced 
AEs in this SOC that led to dose reduction, most commonly thrombocytopenia (15.5%), neutropenia, (8.8%), 
anaemia (8.3%). 
The most common AEs, related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to dose interruption or reduction experienced by 
patients with AdvSM treated at 200 mg QD were similar to those experienced by patients with AdvSM treated 
at all doses. 
The incidence of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders was lower in AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg QD 
(69.0%) as compared with AdvSM patients treated at ≥ 300 mg QD (86.0%). 
•  General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions  
Overall, 135 of the patients with AdvSM treated at all doses (69.9%) experienced AEs in this SOC; the most 
common AEs were oedema peripheral (42.5%), fatigue (26.4%), and face oedema (13.0%). 
Fatigue  is  a  prominent  feature  in  patients  with  AdvSM  (Jennings  et  al,  2018).  Oedema  is  an  expected  and 
manageable toxicity related to on-target KIT/PDGFRA inhibition, which was first demonstrated with imatinib 
treatment (Demetri et al, 2002). 
In this SOC, the majority of patients (n=114, 59%) experienced Grade <3 AEs. The  most common (≥ 5%) 
Grade 3 event was fatigue (5.2%).  
Eight patients (4.1%) experienced SAEs in this SOC, namely pyrexia (2.1%) and disease progression, oedema, 
oedema peripheral, and pain (< 1% each). 
One patient died due to an AE in this SOC (disease progression). 
A total of 18 patients (9.3%) experienced AEs in this SOC that led to dose interruption, most commonly fatigue 
(2.1%), influenza like illness, oedema peripheral and  pyrexia (1.6%  each), and asthenia (1.0%). A total of 
24 patients (12.4%) experienced AEs in this SOC that led to dose reduction, most commonly oedema peripheral 
(5.7%), fatigue (3.1%), asthenia (2.1%), and pain (1%). 
The most common AEs, related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to dose interruption or reduction experienced by 
patients with AdvSM treated at 200 mg QD were similar to those experienced by patients with AdvSM treated 
at all doses.

•  Nervous System Disorders  
Overall, 123 of the patients with AdvSM treated at all doses (63.7%) experienced AEs in the SOC of Nervous 
System Disorders (Table 56). The most common AEs were dysgeusia (18.1%), headache (17.1%), dizziness 
and memory impairment (14.5% each), and cognitive disorder (14.0%) 
In this SOC, the majority of patients (n=103, 54.4%) experienced Grade <3 AEs. 
A total of 13 patients (6.7%) experienced SAEs in this SOC, most commonly haemorrhage intracranial (2.1%), 
dementia and encephalopathy (1.0% each).  
Two patients (1.0%) died due to haemorrhage intracranial and ischaemic stroke. 
A  total  of  23 patients  (11.9%)  experienced  AEs  in  this  SOC  that  led  to  dose  interruption,  most  commonly 
cognitive disorder (5.7%), memory impairment (2.1%), and dementia (1.0%). Twenty-two patients (11.4%)

experienced AEs in this SOC that led to dose reduction, most commonly cognitive disorder (6.2%), memory 
impairment (3.6%), and dysgeusia (1.0%).  
In this SOC, the most common AEs experienced by patients treated at 200 mg QD were generally lower than 
those experienced by patients with AdvSM treated at all doses AEs leading to dose interruption or reduction 
experienced in this group were similar to those experienced by patients treated at all doses. 
•  Renal and urinary disorders  
Eleven (5.7%) of the 193 patients with AdvSM who received treatment with avapritinib (all doses) in clinical 
trials reported 12 events of acute kidney injury (AKI), and 1 (<1%) patient reported 1 event of renal failure. 
All but 1 patient (grade 5) reported events that were Grade 1-3 in severity, and the majority of the events 
resolved and did not lead to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Risk factors/confounders were present in 
11 of the 12 patients, (predominantly hypertension, diabetes, pre-renal azotaemia or infections). Two of the 
thirteen reported events were designated as related.  
In  the  AdvSM  200  mg  group,  acute  kidney  injury  is  reported  in  5  patients  (4.0  %,  considered  related  in  1 
patient) and renal failure in 1 patient (< 1 %, not considered related). One patient in the 200 mg group had 
AKI that led to discontinuation of avapritinib.    
For the GIST indication, the reported frequencies are: AKI (n=17, 2.8 %) and renal failure (n=7, 1.1 %). 
Risk factors/confounders were present in all these 24 patients, but half of the events were considered related 
to treatment.

•  Summary of AEs of Torsade de Pointes/QT Prolongation 
A search of the clinical database for AdvSM studies (BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202) and GIST studies (BLU-
285-1101  and  BLU-285-1303)  was  performed  using  the  standardized  MedDRA  query  (SMQ)  Torsade  de 
pointes/QT  Prolongation.  The  search  revealed  39  patients  (4.9%)  overall  (14  patients  with  AdvSM  and  25 
patients with GIST) who experienced 41 events including Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, syncope, cardiac 
arrest, ventricular tachycardia, loss of consciousness, and ventricular arrhythmia. Serious events were reported 
in 4 patients (< 1%), (2 patients with AdvSM and 2 patients with GIST), and included cardiac arrest, syncope, 
and ventricular tachycardia. These events were all assessed as not related to avapritinib and were described in 
the initial AdvSM submission. There were no new serious events reported during the update period. Eighteen 
patients  (2.2%)  reported Grade  1  events;  6  patients  (<  1%)  reported  Grade 2  events,  13  patients  (1.6%) 
reported Grade 3 events, and 1 patient each (< 1%) reported Grade 4 and Grade 5 events. 
Events from the SMQ Torsade de pointes/QT Prolongation are summarized in Table 23.

Table 62 
One patient with AdvSM had 3 events of electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged; 1 patient with GIST had 2 
events of ventricular arrhythmia and an event of electrocardiogram QT prolonged. One patient with AdvSM had 
a Grade 4 event of cardiac arrest that occurred in the context of haemorrhagic shock with massive blood loss 
due to oesophageal varices haemorrhage; the event was managed with massive transfusion protocol and was 
assessed as not related to avapritinib. The majority of the events (30 of 44; 68.2%) resolved, 13 events were 
ongoing, and 1 event had a fatal outcome. Twenty-one events (47.7%) were assessed as related to avapritinib, 
and 23 events (52.3%) were assessed as not related to avapritinib. All but 4 events were nonserious and there 
were no new serious events during this update period.  
-- Information from Post-Marketing Sources 
Cumulatively as of 20 April 2021, there has been 1 case report containing 1 serious event within the Torsade 
de Pointes/QT prolongation SMQ since marketing authorization. The event was not HCP-confirmed.

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors  
Subgroup  analyses  of  AEs  and  AESIs  were  performed  for  intrinsic  factors  (age,  gender,  race,  nadir  platelet 
count during screening and extrinsic factors (region, prior midostaurin). 
Interpretation  of  these  individual  analyses  is  limited  given  the  small  number  of  patients  within  certain 
subgroups, which may be influenced by the differences in design and populations across studies in the pooled 
Safety  Population.  Due  to  the  risk  mitigation  strategies  implemented  to  minimize  the  risk  for  intracranial 
bleeding, the analysis of nadir platelet count during screening was uninterpretable as most patients had platelet 
counts ≥ 50,000/μL. 
Subgroup analyses relevant for AdvSM are discussed in this section. 
Table 81 summarizes the incidence of AEs,  related  AEs, Grade ≥ 3 AEs, related Grade ≥ 3  AEs,  SAEs,  and 
related SAEs in the subgroup analyses performed for AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg QD.

The overall incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was lower in males (70.3%) than females (82.7%); the greater 
incidence in females was driven by Grade ≥ 3 AEs of neutrophil count decreased (17.3% in females, 1.4% in 
males). 
Serious AEs were reported more frequently in males (47.3%) than in females (25.0%).  
The  incidence  of  intracranial  bleeding  was  similar  for  males  (2.7%)  and  females  (3.8%).  The  incidence  of 
cognitive effects was lower for males (12.2%) than females (28.8%). Memory impairment was experienced 
only by females (13.5%), and more females experienced cognitive disorder (17.3%) than males (8.1%). 
•  Race 
Among the 126 patients with AdvSM treated at 200 mg QD, 109 patients (86.5%) were white, 1 patient (< 1%) 
was Asian, 14 patients (11.1%) were other race, and 2 patients (1.6%) were of unknown race. The incidence 
of AEs overall was the same (100%) across the 3 racial groups of white, non-white, and unknown race and the 
incidence of related AEs was similar (94.5%, 100%, and 100%, respectively) (Table 64). 
Differences across the subgroups for the most commonly reported AEs are summarized in Table 70.

Grade ≥ 3  AEs  were  experienced  by  all  patients  of  unknown  race  (100.0%)  and  most  white and  non-white 
patients (75.2% and 73.3%, respectively); the small number of patients of unknown race  (n=2) should be 
considered  in  evaluating  these  comparisons.  Serious  AEs  were  more  frequently  reported  for  patients  of 
unknown race (100.0%) and white patients (39.4%) than for non-white patients (20.0%). 
Intracranial bleeding events were reported for 3.7% of white patients. No intracranial bleeding events were 
reported for non-white patients and patients of unknown race. The incidence of cognitive effects was similar 
for white (20.2%) and non-white (13.3%) patients, and no patients of unknown race reported this event.

Drug Interactions 
Information  in this  section  was  submitted  previously  and  is  available  in  Module  2.7.4,  Section  5.3,  Original 
Application. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no data in pregnant women exposed to avapritinib, the secretion of avapritinib in human milk or its 
effects on the breastfed infant, or on milk production to assess the risks. 
Further discussion was submitted previously and is available in Module 2.7.4, Section 5.4, Original Application. 
Overdose 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 129/155 
 
 
 
 
No cases of overdose have been reported. The highest dose of avapritinib studied clinically is 600 mg PO QD. 
Adverse reactions observed at this dose were consistent with the safety profile at 300 or 400 mg QD. 
There is no known antidote for avapritinib overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, avapritinib dosing 
should be interrupted and supportive care instituted. Based on the large volume of distribution of avapritinib 
and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of avapritinib. 
Drug Abuse 
There  have  been  no  reports  of  patient  abuse  of  or  dependence  on  avapritinib.  Because  avapritinib  is  not 
pharmacologically or structurally related to drugs known to have abuse potential, drug abuse with avapritinib 
is unlikely. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No formal studies of withdrawal or rebound effects associated with avapritinib treatment have been conducted. 
There have been no AEs of “drug withdrawal syndrome” (MedDRA PT) reported to date. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No formal studies on the effects of avapritinib on the ability to drive or operate machinery have been performed. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
•  Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation 
A total of 40 of the patients with AdvSM (20.7%) treated at all doses experienced AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug (including “disease progression” reported as an AE term and AEs that represented 
symptoms of disease progression). The most common AEs (occurring in > 1% of patients) were acute myeloid 
leukaemia and thrombocytopenia (2.1% each) and ascites, cognitive disorder, haemorrhage intracranial, and 
subdural haematoma (1.6% each). 
The incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug for AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg 
QD (18.3%) was lower than for AdvSM patients treated at ≥ 300 mg QD (26.0%). There were no meaningful 
differences in the incidences of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation between the 200 mg original group 
and 200 mg extended group.

There were no meaningful differences in the incidences of AEs leading to dose interruption and dose reduction 
between the 200 mg original group and 200 mg extended group. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Avapritinib  was  first  approved  in  the  US  on  09  January  2020  by  the  FDA  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with 
unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. 
The approved pharmaceutical strengths of avapritinib are 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg tablets.  
Cumulatively as of 20 April 2021, 238 unique patients (verified unique through specialty pharmacy and HUB) 
have received commercial AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT globally, for an overall estimated exposure of 125.08 patient-
years. Overall, 3,021 AEs in 768 case reports have been reported for avapritinib in the post-marketing setting 
through 20 April 2021.  The most frequently reported  AEs are  fatigue (146 case  reports), nausea  (120 case 
reports)  and  diarrhoea  (96  case  reports),  similar  to  observations  in  clinical  trials  of  GIST  and  AdvSM.  AEs 
reported in ≥ 20 case are shown in Table 16. The majority of AEs reported in the post-marketing setting are 
consumer reports that are not medically confirmed, and therefore, AE severity is not usually reported. No data 
can be provided on Grade ≥ 3 AEs. Additional details on the post-marketing safety of avapritinib will be provided 
in Periodic Safety Update Report #02 (data lock point 08 July 2021), which was submitted on 16 September 
2021.

All Serious Post-Marketing AEs: 
Cumulatively, 366 SAEs in 205 case reports have been reported in the post-marketing setting of avapritinib. 
The most frequently reported SAEs are  death  (23  case  reports), fall (9 case reports) and dementia (9 case 
reports). Most death cases contain very limited information and do not provide consent for follow-up; therefore, 
complete medical assessment cannot be performed. SAEs reported in ≥ 5 case reports are shown in Table 17.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The present application is seeking approval for an extension of the indication to treatment of adult patients 
with AdvSM, including ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL, after at least 1 systemic therapy. The recommended dose of 
avapritinib  is  200  mg  once  daily  (QD),  with  the  possibility  to  perform  dose  adjustment  down  based  on 
tolerability.  
To support this variation, the Applicant originally provided safety data from 2 studies in patients with AdvSM 
(studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202) and updated safety data from patients with GIST. For the purpose 
of the present assessment, the subset of AdvSm patients treated with avapritinib 200mg QD is considered to 
be  the  main  safety  population,  whereas  data  pooling  all  avapritinib  doses  used  in  patients  with  AdvSM  are 
considered supportive.   
During the procedure, the Applicant has provided a safety update with a cut-off date of 20 April 2021, which 
amounts to approximately 10 additional months of follow-up for the patients included in the original submission. 
As a result, the safety population is now composed by 193 patients that received at least one avapritinib dose, 
126 of them treated with 200mg QD (81 from the original submission, 45 new ones), and 50 patients treated 
with 300mg QD. The 23-patient difference between the “all treated” patient cohort and the sum of the dose 
cohorts appears to be due to only 176 patients having their diagnoses confirmed centrally. No new patients 
have been included in the 300mg QD starting dose group.  
Patient exposure 
Among the 126 patients treated with 200mg QD (the “200mg QD extended group”), the median duration of 
treatment  with  avapritinib  was  41.00  weeks  (range  0.9-188.1);  for  the  81  patients  originally  treated  with 
200mg QD, the median updated treatment duration was 67.14 weeks (range: 0.9-188.1), which amounts to 
approximately 37 additional weeks of exposure. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 134/155 
 
 
 
 
Although the overall size of the AdvSM safety database is small, the inclusion of 45 new patients to the 200 
mg QD group is welcomed. The safety update also increased follow-up time and median treatment duration. 
Nevertheless,  the  uncontrolled  nature  of  the  study  design  poses  some  limitations  for  an  adequate 
characterization  of  the  safety  profile  of  avapritinib  in  the  intended  indication,  in  particular,  making  the  AE 
causality assessment difficult. 
With the most recent cut-off date, a total of 38 (30.2%) of the 126 patients treated with avapritinib 200mg QD 
had discontinued treatment, the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment being AE (23 patients, 18.3%), 
followed by withdrawal of consent (6 patients, 4.8%) and disease progression (5 patients, 4.0%).  
Overall, avapritinib appears to be tolerated acceptably at the 200mg QD dose (intended for this indication), 
while  the  300mg  QD  dose  is  no  longer  sought  by  the  MAH  due  to  poor  tolerance.  The  possibility  to 
decrease/interrupt doses, permitted as a way to manage toxicities, appears to be a useful tool, with treatment 
discontinuations due to AE around 18% (for the 200mg QD extended group).  
Regarding the population included, it appears to be representative of the intended target population, although 
some baseline differences in medical history were noted between the ≥300 mg and 200 mg AdvSM populations, 
which could be interpreted as a better baseline status in 200 mg AdvSM population and could contribute to the 
apparent higher tolerability of 200 mg compared to ≥300 mg. Even if differences in health status cannot be 
excluded as a contributing factor, the same types of AEs are observed in both dose groups. Apart from the 
AESIs that are discussed separately, uncertainties in assigned frequencies to AEs due to other health factors 
are not expected to affect the characterization of risks in a clinically significant manner.  
Adverse events 
All AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg QD in the updated safety analysis experienced at least 1 AE, and 78 
(96.3 %) experienced AEs related to avapritinib, which is similar to data from the initial submission.  
In comparison with the original data, the frequencies of AEs, grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs appeared to increase over 
time. For example, the frequencies in the original 200 mg group (updated/initial data) of SAEs (44.4%/33.3%), 
related SAEs (16.0%/11.1%), grade ≥3 AEs (79.0%/71.6%) and related grade ≥3 AEs (63.0%/54.3%) have 
all increased. However, these numbers are lower than the numbers in the ≥300 mg group, both compared to 
initial and updated data, which are similar: SAEs (updated/initial 74.0%/72.0%), related SAEs (32.0%/32.0%), 
grade ≥3 AEs (94.0%/94.0%) and related grade ≥3 AEs (74.0%/74.0%). 
The most common AEs (reported in > 20% of 200mg QD patients) were peripheral oedema (42.9%), anaemia 
(40.5%), periorbital oedema (39.7%), thrombocytopenia (39.7%), diarrhoea (27.8 %) and nausea (23.8 %). 
The  most  common  (≥  5%)  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  in  the  200mg  QD  extended  group  were  anaemia  (21.4%), 
thrombocytopenia  (18.3%),  and  neutropenia  (16.7%),  ,  neutrophil  count  decreased  (57.9%),  and  platelet 
count decreased (6.3 %) 
The most common SAEs were anaemia (4 patients, 3.2 %), subdural haematoma (4 patients, 3.2 %), ascites 
(3 patients, 2.4 %). The most common related SAEs were subdural haematoma (3 patients, 2.4 %), anaemia 
and hamorrhage (2 patients, 1.6 % each).  
Overall,  18.5%  of  patients  (200mg  QD  extended  group)  experience  an  AE  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation,  the  most  frequent  were  thrombocytopenia  and  subdural  haematoma  (3 patients,  2.4  % 
each), while the proportion of patients with any AEs leading to dose interruption or dose reductions were 
69.1% and 74.1%, respectively. The most common AEs leading to dose interruptions were: thrombocytopenia 
(17.5%), neutropenia (11.1%), anaemia (6.3%) and cognitive disorder (6.3%). The most common AEs leading 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 135/155 
 
 
to dose reductions were: thrombocytopenia (19.0%), periorbital oedema (7.9 %), neutropenia (9.5%), oedema 
peripheral (7.1 %), cognitive disorder (6.3%) and platelet count decreased (6.3 %).  
In  this  (200  mg)  dose  group,  5  (6.2%)  patients  died  due  to  AEs,  none  of  them  considered  related  to 
avapritinib. One avapritinib-related death was reported in the ≥300 mg group (intracranial bleeding).  
The  incidence  of  SAEs,  Grade  ≥  3  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment,  AEs  leading  to  dose 
interruption, AEs leading to dose reduction, was generally higher for AdvSM patients treated with ≥300 mg QD 
(and all-dose group) compared with patients treated at 200 mg QD. Likewise, the incidence of AEs leading to 
death was slightly lower for AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg QD than for AdvSM patients treated at ≥300 
mg QD.  
Overall, these  findings point to a worse  tolerance  for the  ≥300mg QD  dose, supporting  the proposed initial 
dosing of 200mg QD.  
The  safety  profile  of  avapritinib in  AdvSM  patients appears  to  be  mostly  consistent  with  the one previously 
observed in the GIST indication and in line with other TKIs.  
 AESIs 
Intracranial  bleeding  is  an  important  identified  risk  for  avapritinib  treatment,  included  in  the  RMP  and 
followed in the post-marketing by means of routine  Pharmacovigilance  and 2 PAES.  In  general,  intracranial 
haemorrhage can lead to marked mortality and morbidity. This type of event is a serious adverse event that 
has been reported for certain other TKIs and could, hypothetically, be pharmacologically driven through the 
inhibition of PDGFRβ, which plays a role in pericyte development and integrity. 
In the original submission, 7.4% of AdvSM patients (11/148) experienced intracranial bleeding events (6 AE 
subdural haematoma and 5 haemorrhage intracranial). Eight patients experienced ≥1 serious events, most of 
them grade 1-2. The incidence of intracranial bleeding was significantly higher in patients with AdvSM (≥300 
mg: 16.0 %, 200 mg: 3.7 %, All doses: 7.4%) than the one observed in patients with GIST (1.8%), which is 
a worrisome safety concern. For the AdvSM studies, the Applicant implemented some risk mitigation strategies 
(exclusion of patients with a platelet count < 50,000/μL at baseline, periodic platelet count monitoring, dose 
modifications,  and  defining  a  lower  starting  dose  [200  mg  QD]).  To  validate  the  effectiveness  of  these  risk 
minimization measures (RMM) and to exclude the possibility that the frequency of ICB in the 200 mg group 
was underestimated compared to the ≥300 mg group due to shorter treatment duration (200 mg: 30.29 weeks 
vs ≥300 mg: 89.64 weeks), the Applicant was requested to provide updated safety data in the response.   
With the provided safety update, only one additional case of ICB has been reported (occurred in the AdvSM 
200 mg extended group). Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/μL) was identified as the primary 
risk factor for intracranial bleeding in AdvSM. Most intracranial bleeding events in AdvSM patients (83.3%; 10 
of 12 patients) have been associated with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/μL) prior to or at 
the time of the event. Two additional reports were received in the post-marketing setting, both of them after 
the patients had experienced a fall. The review of the individual ICB cases occurred in the AdvSM and GIST 
studies (data not shown) indicated that most patients had confounders. 
In the original safety analysis, the incidences of ICB in the 200 mg AdvSM group were 3.7 % (n = 3) overall 
and 2.6 % (n = 2) when patients with pre-existing severe thrombocytopenia were excluded. In the updated 
analysis, the corresponding numbers were 3.2 % and 2.5%, respectively. This supports the effectiveness of 
the  risk  minimization  measures  implemented,  since  a  lower  number  of  cases  were  observed  after  their 
implementation into the studies.  Further, the incidence of ICB appears to be reliably constant in the 200 mg 
group,  which  is  reassuring.  Although  follow  up  is  longer  in  the  ≥  300  mg  group  overall,  greater,  or  similar

numbers of patients have experienced the 200 mg starting dose up to almost 20 months of therapy, the time 
frame  in  which  nearly  all  ICB  events  occurred  (usually  within  6  months).  The  overall  shorter  duration  of 
treatment for patients in the 200 mg group was unlikely to lead to underestimation of the incidence of ICBs. 
Thus, the estimates of the incidences are considered to be acceptably accurate. 
Since the risk of ICB is an important safety issue, the wording originally included in the SmPC was revised 
during the procedure in order to properly reflect this risk and the importance of platelet monitoring and 
(starting and maximum) dose.  
Further, since determining causality in cases of ICB in AdvSM patients is particularly challenging, and in order 
to account for any uncertainties considering the gravity of these events, in the final text agreed for the SmPC 
all cases (all causality) and related cases are presented.  
Cognitive effects are also an important identified risk, incidence in the 200mg QD group went from 14.8% in 
the original submission to 19.0% in the update, compared to 56 % in the ≥300 mg group. The most frequent 
AESIs in this group were cognitive disorder (11.9%), memory impairment (5.6%) and confusional state (2.4%). 
Most  of  these  AESI  were  mild-moderate  in  intensity  and  very  few  led  to  the  permanent  discontinuation  of 
avapritinib. The MAH has provided a listing with the individual cognitive effect AESIs occurred in the AdvSM 
and GIST indications (data not shown).  A large proportion of the patients presented confounders, such as prior 
neuropsychiatric history or medicines with a CNS depressor effect. At this time, the mechanism behind these 
effects  is  not  known.  Currently  available  data  suggest  that  for  the  most  part,  they  are  mild-moderate  in 
intensity,  manageable  by  dose  adjustment  with  a  very  low  incidence  of  permanent  discontinuations,  but 
resolution may be slow (weeks to months).  
Safety  data  in  elderly  patients  (≥65  years  old)  is  limited.  Data  suggest  that  avapritinib  could  be  worse 
tolerated in the elderly population than in younger adults, however, the numbers in some of the subgroups are 
small, particularly for patients over 75 years of age. It is agreed that some of the risks identified for avapritinib 
(e.g.,  oedema,  cognitive  effects,  cytopenias,  among  others)  may  also  occur  more  frequently  in  the  elderly 
population than in younger adults. These risks and their management have been addressed either in the SmPC 
(sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8) or the RMP (e.g., as important identified or potential risks). Overall, no new signals or 
concerning findings have been identified.  The SmPC has been revised to reflect that grade ≥3 AEs occur more 
frequently in the elderly.  
Changes in laboratory parameters, including liver function parameters (i.e., bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline 
phosphatase), blood counts (anemia, neutropenia, mainly) have been observed during avapritinib therapy. No 
new or alarming concerns have been identified. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The characterization of the safety prolife of avapritinib in the intended indication present two main limitations: 
the size of the safety database in patients with AdvSM is small and the AdvSM safety database mainly derives 
from 2 uncontrolled, on-going studies. As a result, there are some uncertainties related to these limitations. 
Prior knowledge on the safety of avapritinib in the GIST indication and its similarities to other TKIs may alleviate 
these concerns to some extent.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 137/155 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of adverse events (100%), severe AEs (81.9%) and SAEs (50.3%) in the overall AdvSM 
patient population was high, suggesting that avapritinib is poorly tolerated, especially at higher doses. Toxicities 
due  to  the  200mg  QD,  for  the  most  part,  appear  to  be  acceptably  tolerated  and  manageable  with  dose 
modification. In addition, the safety profile is mostly consistent to that previously reported for other TKIs, with 
the exception of intracranial bleedings and cognitive disorders. The incidences of these events are concerning, 
but they have been addressed through risk mitigation measures (dose adjustments and platelet monitoring in 
the case of ICBs), which are considered acceptable.    
In summary, the overall safety profile of avapritinib appears consistent with that seen in other indications and 
similar to other TKIs.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, AYVAKYT (avapritinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The current MAA is a grouped application involving both a line extension for two additional strengths (25 mg 
and 50 mg) of avapritinib and an extension of indication (AdvSM). For the benefit risk assessment concerning 
the extension of indication, see section below. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 143/155 
 
 
 
Line extension  
Avapritinib is currently available as an immediate-release tablet for the following strengths 100, 200 and 300 
mg.  
The MAH has now applied for two additional strengths to be approved: 25 mg and 50 mg in order to approve 
the dosing scheme required for the EoI in advanced systemic mastocytosis. The supporting clinical data 
showed that dose-reductions based on tolerability are recommended, with the dose reduction scheme 
200mg-100mg-50mg-25mg. These scheme explains the need for the new strengths 
The new strengths are considered approvable from a quality perspective. 
In order to demonstrate that the new strengths are bioequivalent to the currently approved strengths, the 
MAH has not submitted clinical bioequivalence studies, but instead presented a rationale for a strength-based 
waiver for the 25 mg and 50 mg tablets. The CHMP Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**) lists general criteria that must be met for a strength-based 
biowaiver to be approvable. The MAH has demonstrated that these are met: i.e.: same manufacturing 
process, identical qualitative composition of the different strengths, quantitatively proportional compositions 
between the previously approved strengths and the two new strengths, and appropriate in vitro dissolution 
data. Dose proportionality of avapritinib was confirmed over the dose rage of 25 – 100 mg and supports the 
biowaiver for 25 and 50 mg tablet strength.  
Based on the above the new strengths i.e. avapritinib 25 mg and 50 mg immediate-release tablets, are 
considered approvable.  
Extension of indication 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is: 
“AYVAKYT  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  aggressive  systemic 
mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an  associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) or  mast 
cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy.” 
Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a clonal mast cell neoplasm, driven by the KIT D816V mutation, where 
abnormal activation of MC leads to debilitating and life-threatening symptoms. To set the diagnosis of 
systemic mastocytosis, certain criteria must be met. Either one major plus one minor criterium or 3 minor 
criteria have to be fulfilled. Major criterion: dense infiltrates of >15 mast cells in the bone marrow or an 
extracutaneous organ. Minor criteria: aberrant phenotype on the mast cells (positivity for CD2 and/or CD25), 
aberrant mast cell morphology (spindle-shaped), finding of mutation in KIT(D816V) and S-tryptase >20 
ng/ml. 
SM can be broadly divided into non-advanced and advanced SM, on the basis of so-called B- and C-findings in 
these patients. AdvSM encompasses a group of high-risk subtypes with a poor prognosis, including ASM, SM-
AHN, and MCL. SM with the copresence of an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) comprises the 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 144/155 
 
 
majority of AdvSM cases. The AHN component is typically myeloid, including CMML, MDS, MPN, CEL, and AML. 
SM-AHN  commonly  presents  with  C-findings.  SM  with  C-findings,  but  without  additional  adverse  pathologic 
features, is rare and known as aggressive systemic mastocyotsis (ASM). The presence of excess (≥ 20%) MCs 
in the BM aspirate smear is characteristic of a rare, highly aggressive SM variant known as MCL. MCL commonly 
presents with C-findings and can co-occur with AHN.  
Although heterogeneity characterizes the clinical presentation and prognosis of SM, the pathogenesis is 
largely shared, with D816 mutations in KIT found in 93% of SM cases, regardless of subtype (Garcia-Montero 
et al, 2006). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients  with  AdvSM  have  limited  treatment  options.  Current  recommended  therapies  include  midostaurin 
(approved in the EU and the US), cladribine and interferon alfa (both used off-label), and imatinib (approved 
in the US only for a small subset of adult patients with ASM without KIT D816V or with unknown KIT mutation 
status). 
Despite the approval of midostaurin for treatment of AdvSM in 2017, cladribine is still recommended for patients 
who need rapid debulking or have to discontinue midostaurin due to toxicity, and interferon is recommended 
for patients with slow PD without the need for rapid cytoreduction (Pardanani, 2019). 
However,  MC  burden  has  proven  difficult  to  eradicate  with  current  therapies,  and  thus  improvement  in 
symptoms  of  organ  damage,  rather  than  MC  burden  reduction,  has  historically  been  the  endpoint  used  in 
assessing response in AdvSM. Current therapies improve organ damage in 35% to 70% of patients (per Valent 
consensus criteria), but these responses are often not durable, and CR is rare. BM MC burden and elevations 
in serum tryptase typically persist both during and after therapy (Pardanani, 2021)..Cladribine, interferon alfa, 
and imatinib may be effective in some patients with AdvSM, but complete responses are rarely achieved and 
the symptom relief they provide is often transitory. On the other hand, currently used systemic therapies are 
often associated with significant, sometimes life-threatening, side effects. (Pardanani, 2021). 
While midostaurin provides proof of principle for targeting KIT D816V as a disease-driver mutation in AdvSM, 
most responses to treatment are incomplete and/or not sustained 
Overall, given the poor survival with the current standard of care, and the modest activity and tolerability of 
currently used therapies, there is a need for more treatment options for patients with AdvSM. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on the efficacy results from the ongoing phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 2-cohort 
study BLU-285-2202 (PATHFINDER) n=107) and supported by the phase 1, open-label dose escalation 
study BLU-285-2101 (EXPLORER) (n=86) as described below. The studies were conducted in countries in 
Europe and North America. Both studies include patients with prior systemic therapy as well as treatment-
naïve patients. 
Study BLU-285-2101 (EXPLORER) is an ongoing, open-label, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antineoplastic activity (efficacy) of avapritinib, administered orally, in 
adult patients with AdvSM and relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. As of the data cut-off date of 27 
May 2020, enrolment in the study is complete at 86 patients and patients remaining on study are being followed 
for response and safety assessments. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 145/155 
 
 
The primary objective was to establish the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose.  
This 2-part study included: 
• 
an initial dose escalation (Part 1, complete) to evaluate safety and tolerability of increasing doses of 
avapritinib (from 30 to 400 mg QD) in patients with a local diagnosis of AdvSM or other relapsed or 
refractory myeloid malignancies,  
• 
and  an  expansion  (Part  2,  ongoing)  to  further  evaluate  the  safety,  PK,  pharmacodynamics,  and 
efficacy  (according  to  mIWG-MRT-ECNM  response  criteria)  of  avapritinib  in  the  treatment  of  AdvSM 
when administered at starting doses of 200 or 300 mg QD.  
Part 2 enrolled patients with a WHO diagnosis of AdvSM. 
The  main  study  BLU-285-2202  (PATHFINDER)  is  an  ongoing,  open-label,  single-arm,  Phase  2  study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of avapritinib 200 mg QD in patients with a WHO diagnosis of AdvSM. Patients 
with a centrally confirmed WHO diagnosis of AdvSM were enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1: patients with ≥ 1 mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria for evaluable disease (with an evaluable C-finding 
or MCL), as determined by the Study Steering Committee (SSC) (n=85). 
•  Cohort  2:  patients who were not considered eligible  for an  adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM response, as 
determined by the SSC (n=22). 
Patients in Cohort 1 support the primary objective of determining SSC-adjudicated ORR by mIWG-
MRT-ECNM  criteria.  Both  cohorts  are  included  in  the  analyses  of  secondary  and  exploratory  efficacy 
objectives. 
A  pre-planned  interim  analysis  was  performed  when  32  patients  enrolled  in  Cohort  1  were  considered 
evaluable for response. Results of this interim analysis were included as part of the initial submission. At that 
time the population evaluable for the primary endpoint (RE Population), i.e. ORR by mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, 
included 32 patients (Cohort 1), (DCO for the interim analysis 23 June 2020), with 23 patients having received 
prior systemic therapy and enrolment ongoing. Follow-up was limited. Updated data with a DCO of 20 April 
2021  and  including  42  additional  RE  patients,  ,    were  submitted  during  the  procedure,  thus  providing 
approximately 10 months of additional follow-up. Twenty six  out  of the  new  42 patients had  received prior 
systemic therapy. The combined IA and post IA population (n=74 patients) therefore includes 49 patients who

.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Both studies BLU-285-2101 and BLU-285-2202 are uncontrolled single arm trials with associated well known 
limitations, e.g. risk of selection bias and potential overestimation of  the effect. In addition,  the  number of 
patients,  even  considering  data  from  new  patients  submitted  during  the  procedure,  is  low,  especially 
considering the three different disease entities/subgroups (of very different prognosis) that have been included. 
The  reported  ORR  data  from  study  BLU-285-2202  submitted  in  the  initial  application  and  updated  data 
submitted during the procedure are considered to be overall consistent although follow-up time remains limited 
particularly  in  the  newly  enrolled  patients  /  post-IA  patient  population.  Median  DoR  is  still  not  reached.  
Therefore, the applicant is recommended to submit the final clinical study report from study  BLU-285-2202, 
anticipated to be available in December 2026 (REC). 
Besides data being currently immature, interpretation of time to event endpoints, in particular PFS and OS, is 
hampered in the context of a single arm trial and should therefore be considered with caution. Even if follow-
up is still short, particularly in newly included patients, with median DOR not yet reached, (updated) efficacy 
data currently available show that clinically relevant responses can be obtained with avapritinib treatment in 
AdvSM patients after at least one systemic treatment in whom an improvement in symptoms and control of 
the disease can be considered to represent clinical benefit 
In the absence of an RCT, comparison with an external control, efficacy data from the midostaurin registrational 
trial (CPKC412D2201), was performed. The direct comparability of the patients in these two trials, as well as 
their  management,  cannot  be  ensured.  In  addition,  the  criteria  used  for  assessment  of  response  in  the 
avapritinib  trials  (mIWG-MRT-ECNM)  are  distinct  from  the  criteria  used  for  evaluation  of  efficacy  in  the 
midostaurin trial (IWG-MRT-ECNM). For the RWE retrospective trial, BLU-285-2405, similar issues with ensuring 
comparability of the patient populations apply. 
The  addition  of  an  interim  analysis  for  the  phase  2  trial  was  triggered  post-hoc.  The  interim  analysis  was 
included in the protocol plan almost 7 months after the start of the recruitment (protocol amendment 3, 18 
June 2019). The single arm design poses further concerns since this change can be considered data-driven, 
and therefore, no formal adjustment for inference is feasible. Consequently, results should be interpreted with 
caution since there is no type I error control in this scenario.  
In the SmPC, dose-reductions based on tolerability are recommended, with the dose reduction scheme 200mg-
100mg-50mg-25mg.  No  exposure-response  relationship  has  been  characterised,  and  there  are  limited data 
available for the efficacy at the lower doses in patients that have received dose reductions. However ORR in 
study BLU-285-2202 was promising despite the majority of patients had a dose reduction”

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse reactions of any grade during treatment with AYVAKYT at a starting dose of 200 mg 
were periorbital oedema (38%), thrombocytopenia (37%), oedema peripheral (33%), and anaemia (22%).   
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients receiving avapritinib. The most common serious adverse 
reactions during treatment with avapritinib were subdural haematoma (2%), anaemia (2%), and haemorrhage 
(2%).  
In  AdvSM  patients  treated  at  200 mg,  7.1%  had  adverse  reactions  leading  to  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation. In two patients (1.6%), subdural haematoma occurred. Cognitive disorder, depressed mood, 
diarrhoea,  disturbance  in  attention,  haemoglobin  decreased,  hair  colour  changes,  libido  decreased,  nausea, 
neutropenia,  premature  menopause  and  thrombocytopenia  occurred  in  one  patient  (0.8%  each).  Adverse 
reactions leading to a dose reduction included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, periorbital oedema, cognitive 
disorder, oedema peripheral, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, anaemia, asthenia, fatigue, 
arthralgia,  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  and  white  blood  cell  count 
decreased.” 
Overall,  18.5%  of  patients  (200mg  QD  extended  group)  experience  an  AE  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation,  while  the  proportion  of  patients  with  any  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  or  dose 
reductions were 69.1% and 74.1%, respectively.  
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and subdural haematoma (3 patients, 
2.4  %  each).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruptions  were  thrombocytopenia  (17.5%), 
neutropenia (11.1%), anaemia (6.3%) and cognitive disorder (6.3%). The most common AEs leading to dose 
reductions  were  thrombocytopenia  (19.0%),  periorbital  oedema  (7.9  %),  neutropenia  (9.5%),  oedema 
peripheral (7.1 %), cognitive disorder (6.3%) and platelet count decreased (6.3 %). 
Cognitive effects and intracranial bleedings were considered AESI and were reported by 24 (19.0%) and 
4 (3.2%) of AdvSM patients treated in the 200mg QD extended group, respectively, a majority of the cases 
were considered as treatment-related.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main limitations of the safety database are related to the small size (126 AdvSM patients treated with the 
intended 200mg QD dose, 193 overall), and difficulties in establishing a causal relationship with avapritinib for 
key adverse events in the context of non-controlled, on-going studies and of a severe underlying condition.  
Thus,  there  are  some  uncertainties  related  to  these  limitations.  However,  prior  knowledge  on  the  GIST 
indication and similarities observed in the safety profile alleviate this concern to some extent.  
Events of intracranial bleedings (ICB) can cause  severe morbidity and mortality. Underlying mechanisms of 
how avapritinib cause intracranial haemorrhage are not understood. The increased prevalence of intracranial 
bleedings in AdvSM patients (≥300 mg group: 16.0 %, 200 mg group: 3.2 %) compared to GIST patients (1.8 
%) is attributed, in part, to thrombocytopenia. Reduction of the starting dose to 200 mg, platelet monitoring 
and treatment interruption for levels < 50,000/µL were implemented to mitigate the risk of ICB (see section 
4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 148/155 
 
 
 
A  mechanistic understanding  of  how  avapritinib  induces  cognitive  effects  is  lacking,  but  these  AEs  are  very 
frequently reported. It appears that cognitive effects manifest for many patients within study week 30, but 
may debut late (> 1 year). Resolution is slow and partial (the probability of resolution of a grade ≥2 event was 
50 % by 24.1 weeks). It is not fully elucidated to what extent this affects normal life.   
Overall, the safety profile is consistent to that previously reported for the GIST indication, with the exception 
of ICBs and cognitive effects. These events are important safety concerns, but they are now considered to be 
adequately addressed with the proposed risk minimisation measures, updated text in the SmPC and through 
post-marketing studies

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The reported ORR by centrally adjudicated mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria for avapritinib in patients with a rare and 
aggressive  disease  such  as  AdvMS  previously  treated  with  at  least  one  systemic  therapy,  i.e.  with  limited 
treatment alternatives, is considered promising and expected to translate into clinically meaningful benefit, in 
particular if supported by long duration of achieved responses. Median DOR has not been reached which can 
be interpreted as encouraging but also reinforces the need for additional follow-up data to confirm long-term 
benefit. This noted, currently  available efficacy data show  that clinically relevant responses can be obtained 
with avapritinib treatment in AdvSM patients after at least one systemic therapy in whom an improvement in

symptoms and control of the disease can be considered to represent clinical benefit. Observation of clinically 
relevant responses apply to all included disease entities, although MCL seems to be the most difficult to treat 
with also less representation in the efficacy dataset.  
In the absence of an RCT, the applicant has compared the response in the main study against that observed 
for  midostaurin.  The  comparison  seems  overall  favourable  to  avapritinib.  However,  patients  treated  with 
midostaurin are an external control group and therefore the results of this comparison should be interpreted 
with  caution,  particularly  in  view  of  differences  in  the  patient  populations  and  assessment  criteria  used  for 
evaluation of efficacy (See EPAR for midostaurin).  
Data on time to event endpoints, PFS and OS, are currently immature and their evaluation is hampered in the 
context of a single arm trial.  
The  applicant  has  provided  results  from  a  retrospective  RWE  trial  showing  an  improved  median  OS  in  the 
avapritinib  cohort  compared  with  the  BAT  cohort.  The  results  of  this  indirect  comparison  are  only  to  be 
considered  supportive,  for  contextualization  purposes,  in  view  of  the  well-known  limitations  with  ensuring 
comparability between populations and overall interpretation.  
The overall safety database for avapritinib is small and based on on-going, non-controlled studies, making any 
causality assumption challenging. Thus, there are  some uncertainties related to these  limitations. However, 
prior knowledge on the GIST indication and similarities observed in the safety profile alleviate this concern to 
some extent.  The overall incidence of adverse events (100%), including serious (38.1%), and severe (grade 
≥3) AEs (75.4%) is high for the intended dose (i.e., 200mg QD). Avapritinib was poorly tolerated based on the 
high frequency of AEs leading to dose interruptions/reductions (66.7%, and 72.5% of patients, respectively). 
The recommendations for dose adjustments (to 200 mg) appeared to mitigate these toxicities to an acceptable 
level, with only 18.5% discontinuing study treatment due to an AE.  
The tolerability profile and benefit/risk balance could potentially be improved with even lower initial avapritinib 
doses. However, as lower starting doses have not been prospectively tested, and the dose-response relationship 
is not characterised, it is unknown whether lower initial doses would maintain similar clinical benefit. In general, 
the toxicities appear to be manageable with dose adjustment/temporary treatment interruptions. Considering 
the  severity  of  the  study  disease,  this  safety  profile  could  be  considered  favourable/acceptable  in  front  of 
outstanding benefits.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The reported ORR  by centrally adjudicated  mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria  for avapritinib  in  patients with AdvMS 
previously  treated  with  at  least  one  systemic  therapy,  i.e.  in  a  rare  disease  setting  with  limited  treatment 
alternatives, is considered promising and expected to translate into clinically meaningful benefit in the long-
term,  in  particular  if  supported  by  long  duration  of  achieved  responses.  Even  if  follow-up  is  short  in  many 
patients  and    a  median  DOR  not  yet  reached,  efficacy  data  currently  available  show  that  clinically  relevant 
responses can be obtained with avapritinib treatment in AdvSM patients after at least one systemic therapy in 
whom an improvement in symptoms and control of the disease can be considered to represent clinical benefit.  
The overall safety profile of avapritinib appears consistent with that seen in the GIST indication and similar of 
that for other TKIs. Avapritinib is tolerable, with a safety profile that appears to be manageable.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation  
EMA/135619/2022 
Page 151/155 
 
 
 
With this in mind, it is considered that the benefit reported with avapritinib in the intended patient population 
in  the  context  of  a  manageable  safety  profile,  translates  in  a  positive  benefit  risk  ratio  with  (outstanding) 
efficacy results outweighing/mitigating the methodological concerns discussed.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of AYVAKYT is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ayvakyt is not similar to Rydapt within the meaning of Article 3 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, AYVAKYT new strengths 25 and 50 mg and existing strengths 100 and 200 mg 
film coated tablets is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) 
AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha 
(PDGFRA) D842V mutation. 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) 
AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic 
mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) or mast 
cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for AYVAKYT subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

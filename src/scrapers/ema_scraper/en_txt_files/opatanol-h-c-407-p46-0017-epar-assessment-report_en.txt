Methods 
Objective 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the ocular safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% 
ophthalmic solution compared to vehicle in patients 2 years of age or older with asymptomatic eyes, 
when administered once daily in both eyes for up to 6 weeks. 
Study design 
Phase III, multi-centre, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study. The 
expected duration of patient participation in this study was 7 weeks, with 4 office visits (Baseline and 
Weeks 1, 3, and 6) and 4 telephone contacts (Weeks 2, 4, 5, and 7). At the Baseline Visit (Day 0), 
patients whose eligibility was confirmed were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive olopatadine 
hydrochloride 0.77% ophthalmic solution or vehicle (placebo) respectively.  
Patients < 6 years of age were randomized from 1 randomization schedule and patients ≥ 6 years of 
age were randomized from another randomization schedule. All randomized patients were to receive 1 
drop of either olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% ophthalmic solution or vehicle once daily in both eyes 
for 6 weeks. 
Study population /Sample size 
All patients who completed screening were randomized (500 patients; 100%) at Baseline (Visit 1, Day 
0); of these, 331 patients were randomized to receive olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77%, while 169 
patients were randomized to receive vehicle. 
The mean age of the overall patient population was 32.1 (± 16.6) years, and ranged from 2 to 74 
years. Most of the patients (424 patients; 85.0%) were ≥ 18 years of age, while a total of 75 
patients (15.0%) were < 18 years of age, i.e. paediatric patients. Most paediatric patients 
were 2 to 11 years of age (68 patients; 13.6%); of these, 56 patients (11.2%) were < 6 
years of age. The remainder (7 patients; 1.4%) were 12 to 17 years of age. The majority of 
the patients were not contact lens wearers (424 patients; 85.0%). 
A total of 325 patients (65.1%) included in this study were female, while 174 patients (34.9%) were 
male. The majority of the patients (429 patients; 86.0%) were White. 
Treatments 
•  Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77%, 
•  Vehicle solution/placebo 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety variables and assessments included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp examinations 
(SLEs), intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, dilated fundus examinations (DFEs), vital signs 
(pulse and blood pressure), and adverse events (AEs). 
Statistical Methods 
Of the 500 randomized patients, 1 patient in the olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% group was excluded 
from the safety analysis set because the patient was randomized in error and, therefore, did not 
receive study drug.

The safety analysis set included all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. Patients were 
analyzed according to the actual treatment received. Descriptive statistics including mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum were provided for ocular safety and vital signs parameters 
by treatment group. In addition, counts and percentages were presented by treatment group for 
patients exceeding pre-specified thresholds on the ocular safety and vital signs parameters as well as 
for patients with occurrence of adverse experiences. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was 
planned or conducted. The safety analysis also included an evaluation of both AEs and safety related 
parameters according to age. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall, 518 patients were screened, of whom 500 patients completed screening, while 18 patients 
failed screening. All patients who completed screening were randomized (500 patients; 100%) at 
Baseline (Visit 1, Day 0); of these, 331 patients were randomized to receive olopatadine hydrochloride 
0.77%, while 169 patients were randomized to receive vehicle. 
Baseline data 
Efficacy results 
Not applicable for this safety study. 
Safety results 
Adverse Events 
An overview of deaths, serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs leading to study discontinuation was presented for 
the safety analysis set. There were no deaths or SAEs reported during the study. 
A total of 2 patients (1.2%) in the vehicle group discontinued the study due to non-serious AEs, none 
of which were considered to be related the study drug, while no patients in the olopatadine 
hydrochloride 0.77% group were discontinued from the study due to AEs. 
A review of significant AEs (i.e. AEs that lead to an intervention, including withdrawal of study 
medication, dose reduction, or significant concomitant therapy) reported during the study identified no 
safety issues for olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77%. 
Best-corrected visual acuity 
No clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups in terms of visual acuity for the overall 
safety population or for the individual age groups were observed over the course of the study. 
Ocular signs 
An assessment of ocular sign parameters was performed at Baseline and at each subsequent office 
visit (Weeks 1, 3, and 6) using a slit-lamp. A change in an ocular sign parameter was defined as an 
increase of ≥ 1 units from Baseline for either eye compared to the same eye at Baseline.No clinically 
relevant differences between the treatment groups in terms of ocular signs for the overall safety 
population or for the individual age groups was observed over the course of the study. 
Intraocular pressure 
An assessment of IOP was performed for both eyes for all patients at Baseline and at the last office 
visit (Week 6).

No clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups in terms of IOP for the overall safety 
population or for the individual age groups were observed over the course of the study. 
Dilated fundus examination 
Dilated fundus examination was performed for all patients at Baseline and at the last office visit (Week 
6) No clinically relevant differences between treatment groups in terms of DFE for the overall safety 
population or for the individual age groups were observed over the course of the study 
Vital signs 
Cardiovascular parameters were measured for all patients at Baseline and at the last office visit (Week 
6). 
A review of these data revealed that mean changes in cardiovascular parameters from Baseline were 
minimal, with no discernible trend towards increases or decreases for the overall safety population or 
individual age groups over the course of the study. No clinically relevant differences was observed over 
the course of the study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Overall, there were no unexpected safety findings in the 499 patients with asymptomatic eyes, 
following treatment with olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% ophthalmic solution or vehicle, when 
administered once daily in both eyes for up to 6 weeks. 
Based upon a review of AEs which included an assessment of incidence, seriousness (serious/non-
serious), treatment-relatedness, rate of discontinuation due to AEs, and individual AE characteristics 
(e.g. severity, onset, duration), olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% ophthalmic solution was well-
tolerated and no clinically relevant differences were identified between the olopatadine hydrochloride 
0.77% group and the vehicle group. 
No discernible trends from baseline or clinically relevant differences between the olopatadine 
hydrochloride 0.77% group and the vehicle group were observed, based upon a review of safety 
parameters which included BCVA, ocular sign parameters, IOP, dilated fundus parameters, and vital 
signs. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk assessment for olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% ophthalmic solution 
remains positive for the currently approved indications and justifies the continued use of the product in 
the approved paediatric patient populations No changes to the paediatric information of the current 
olopatadine hydrochloride Company Core Data Sheet or the Summary of Product Characteristics are 
proposed as a result of this study.

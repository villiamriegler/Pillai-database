SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 Introduction 
Chronic  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterized  by 
autoantibody-induced  platelet  destruction  and  reduced  platelet  production,  leading  to  a  low 
peripheral blood platelet count (<150,000/μL). The epidemiology of ITP shows an overall incidence 
of ITP among adults from 1.6 to 3.0 per 100,000 person years of observation. Prevalence estimates 
range from 2.1 to approximately 36.4 per 100,000 persons. The estimated adult prevalence is 24.6 
per 100,000 persons. 
The  exact  aetiology  of  ITP  is  unknown  and  the  diagnosis  of  ITP  remains  one  of  exclusion.  The 
clinical  hallmark  of  the  disease  is  an  increased,  pathological  tendency  to  bleed,  spontaneously  or 
after  minimal  trauma.  Routine  diagnostic  tools  are  blood  count,  peripheral  blood  film,  patient 
history, physical examination and prompt response to high-dose corticosteroids 
Disease management decisions in patients with chronic ITP are based primarily on platelet count and 
severity of bleeding. The goal of treatment is to elevate platelet counts to a safe range (≥50,000/μL to 
250,000/μL) to minimise the risk of bleeding. Medical treatment to elevate platelet counts to a safe 
range  is  recommended  if  patients’  platelet  count  is  below  30,000/μL  or  if  bleeding  symptoms  are 
present.  
Currently immunoglobulins (anti-D and IVIg) are used for the treatment of ITP. Additional drugs to 
treat  chronic  ITP  include  corticosteroids,  azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide,  or  vincristine.  Based  on 
the  literature,  first-line  treatment  with  intravenous  immunoglobulins  or  corticosteroids  results  in 
normal  or  sufficient  platelet  counts  in  about  70%  of  patients  with  chronic  ITP.  IVIg  typically 
provides a temporary elevation of platelet counts within up to 5 days and for an average duration of 
3-4  weeks.  Corticosteroids  will  induce  a  response  within  up  to  two  weeks,  although  the  effect  is 
often not sustained upon dose reduction or cessation of treatment, and long-term administration of 
corticosteroids  is  limited  by  the  development  of  side  effects.  Furthermore,  corticosteroid-treated 
patients are at increased risk of infections. Second-line therapy typically involves splenectomy. Two-
thirds of patients with ITP who undergo splenectomy will achieve a normal platelet count, which is 
often sustained with no additional therapy. Patients who do not have a complete response can still 
expect some improvement in platelet counts (e.g. partial response) or transient increases in platelet 
count.  When  adult  patients  fail  to  first  and  second  line  therapies,  they  are  considered  as  chronic 
refractory ITP. The actual percentage of patients defined as having refractory ITP varies from 11% 
to  35%.  Romiplostim  (Nplate),  a  recombinant  protein  that  increases  platelet  production  through 
activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R), was authorised in the EU in February 2009. 
This  application  seeks  marketing  authorization  for  Revolade  (eltrombopag)  as  a  centralised 
procedure  according  to  (EC)  No  726/2004,  Mandatory  scope  (Article  3(1)),  Annex  (4)  Orphan 
designated medicinal product. Eltrombopag received an orphan medicinal product designation in the 
European  Union  on  03  August  2007  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  ITP  (Community  Register  of 
OMP´s EU/3/07/467).  
The claimed therapeutic indication is: 
‘Revolade  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  previously  treated  patients  with  chronic  idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to increase platelet counts and reduce or prevent bleeding.’ 
The approved therapeutic indication is: 
5/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered as second line treatment for adult 
non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated”. 
A  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  for  the  condition  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP) 
has been agreed by the PDCO. The subset of the paediatric population concerned by the paediatric 
development included children from 1 year to less than 18 years. Newborns and infants from birth to 
less than 1 year have been waived on the grounds that ITP does not occur in this paediatric subset. 
The  paediatric  plan  included  the  development  of  new  a  powder  formulation  for  oral  suspension  in 
fixed  single-dose  sachets  and  a  clinical  study  to  investigate  the  safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  of 
eltrombopag  in  patients  diagnosed  with  ITP  from  1  year  to  less  than  18  years  old.  A  deferral  has 
been granted for completion of the quality study and for the initiation and completion of the clinical 
study. 
Revolade  is  a  small  molecule  for  oral  administration  that  increases  platelet  production  through 
activation  of  the  TPO-R.  The  recommended  initial  dose  for  eltrombopag  is  50  mg  once  daily 
administered orally. If after 2 to 3 weeks of initial therapy, the platelet counts are below the clinically 
indicated levels (e.g. 50,000/μL); the dose may be increased to a maximum of 75 mg once daily. A 
dose reduction is recommended for patients with platelet counts between 150,000 and 250,000/μL. 
Once  the  platelet  count  is  <100,000/μL,  therapy  should  be  reinitiated  at  a  reduced  daily  dose. 
Eltrombopag  treatment  should  only  be  initiated  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  treatment  of 
thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed 
by the exclusion of other clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia. Consideration should be 
given to performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy over the course of the disease and treatment, 
particularly in patients over 60 years of age, those with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs. 
2.2 Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Revolade  is  presented  in  the  form  of  film-coated  tablets  containing  31.9  mg  or  63.8  mg  of 
eltrombopag  olamine  equivalent  to  25  mg  or  50  mg  of  eltrombopag  respectively.  The  tablets  are 
packaged  in  blisters  composed  of  polyamide  /  aluminium  foil  /  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  laminate 
sealed with aluminium foil lidding with a vinyl acrylic seal coating. 
Other excipients in the product are listed in Section 6.1 of the SPC. 
Active Substance 
Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small molecule TPO-R agonist present in the form of the bis-
monoethanolamine (olamine) salt.   
It  is  a  crystalline  solid,  red/brown,  sparingly  soluble  in  water.  The  molecule  does  not  contain 
asymmetric centres although it exists as the  
6/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Z - conformer in the solid state. It is thermally stable up to about 125°C. One solid state form (Form 
1), is consistently obtained by the synthetic process described, and this is the form that appears in the 
product. The active substance is milled to produce a consistent particle size distribution.   
•  Manufacture 
The  manufacturing  process  is  correctly  described,  and  specifications  for  reagents,  solvents  and 
auxiliary materials used in the process are satisfactory. All critical in-process controls parameters are 
well established and justified. The isolated intermediate is controlled by well described and validated 
methods.  A  single  route  of  synthesis  has  been  used  throughout  the  chemical  development  of 
eltrombopag olamine. Based on knowledge gained during development of the process, together with 
tools  such  as  a  Parameter  Attribute  Matrix  (PAM)  and  FMEA  risk  assessment,  the  process 
parameters most likely to have the greatest impact on API quality have been identified. 
The chemical structure is well characterised by the usual range of spectroscopic and physicochemical 
studies. All relevant characteristics of this substance have been studied and established. 
Concerning  the  impurities  likely  to  arise  during  the  synthesis,  a  reasoned  discussion  has  been 
provided  according  to  ICH  Q3A  (R2)  Guideline,  including  their  origin  according  to  the 
manufacturing process described and the main degradation pathways.  
•  Specification 
In  general,  the  specification  proposed  is  suitable  to  control  the  quality  of  the  drug  substance.  In 
addition to the potential impurities, those impurities routinely found to arise during the synthesis of 
the active substance have been identified and controlled using validated methodology. Furthermore, 
the  specified  limits  have  been  justified  with  reference  to  toxicology  studies.  Results  of  over  30 
batches used in clinical, non-clinical and stability studies were provided during the evaluation phase 
and all recent batches at the intended commercial scale complied with the agreed specification.  
•  Stability 
The drug substance is stored in HDPE containers lined with anti-static LDPE bags and sealed with 
plastic ties. The main degradation pathways of eltrombopag olamine have been defined.   
The  stability  studies  and  conditions  are  in  agreement  with  ICH  Q1A  Guideline  and  the  tests 
performed  are  considered  stability  indicating.  Based  on  the  accumulated  stability  data  so  far,  a 
suitable and practical retest period has been defined.  
Medicinal Product 
The  tablets  have  been  formulated  to  contain  the  following  excipients:  Microcrystalline  cellulose, 
mannitol,  povidone  K-30,  sodium  starch  glycolate,  magnesium  stearate  and  Opadry  White  YS-1-
7706-G  or  Opadry  Brown  03B26716.  The  Opadry  White  film  coat  consists  of  hypromellose, 
macrogol 400, polysorbate 80 and titanium dioxide (E171). The Opadry Brown film coat consists of 
hypromellose,  macrogol  400,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  Iron  oxide  Yellow  (E-172)  and  Iron  oxide 
Red (E-172). The excipients and packaging are usual for this type of dosage form. 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  product  has  been  adequately  performed  and  the  choice  of 
excipients  is  justified  and  their  functions  explained.  Appropriate  multivariate  experimental  plans 
were designed based on the prior knowledge and the risk analysis. Based on the multivariate design 
of  experiments,  a  design  space  for  the  manufacturing  process  parameters  has  been  defined.  The 
process inputs and the Critical Quality attributes are clearly defined in the design space. The choice 
of the packaging is justified. The composition of the batches used for clinical studies are similar to 
the final drug product.

•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  covers  dry  mixing  of  ingredients,  granulation,  wet  milling,  drying, 
milling  blending  (pre-lubrication  and  lubrication),  compression,  coating  and  packaging.  A 
manufacturing  process  flow  diagram  and  a  description  of  the  manufacturing  operations  are   
provided.    There  is  evidence  of  a  significant  level  of  manufacturing  experience  obtained  during 
development, scale-up, and production of clinical supplies. 
•  Product Specification 
The  product  specifications  cover  appropriate  parameters  for  this  dosage  form  and  include  specific 
references to PhEur where applicable.  The analytical  methods have been adequately described and 
validated.  The  analytical  methods  used  are  a  combination  of  traditional  methods  and  methods 
developed  using  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  principles.  Batch  analytical  data  from  the  proposed 
production site have been provided, demonstrating compliance with the release specifications.  
•  Stability of the Product 
Results  of  long-term  and  accelerated  primary  stability  studies  when  stored  at  30°C/65%  RH  or  
40°C/75%  RH,  respectively,  have  been  provided.  At  submission,  twenty-four  months’  data  were 
provided  for  these  batches  stored  under  long  term  condition,  and  6  months’  data  provided  for  the 
batches  stored  under  accelerated  condition.  All  results  from  both  primary  stability  and  supportive 
stability batches comply with the limits and no significant changes and trend were observed in all the 
tested parameters. , generated from market image packs or supporting data from other presentations. 
Forced degradation studies and photostability studies have also been carried out. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  this  sparingly-soluble  drug  product  has  been  performed  in  a 
satisfactory way. Attention has focussed on the physical state of the active substance, in particular 
the particle size, in order to obtain consistent bioavailability. A risk-based approach is applied to the 
development  of  the  active  substance  (in  the  synthesis  process  of  eltrombopag  free  acid  and  the 
synthesis of eltrombopag olamine) in order to establish the design space and control strategy for the 
process parameters. Concerning pharmaceutical development of the product, the design intent was to 
develop  an  oral  formulation,  with  a  minimal  number  of  tablets  per  dose.  A  risk  based  approach 
(FMEA  and  BRITEST)  was  utilised  during  development,  to  identify  and  mitigate  risks  by  dosage 
form design, the manufacturing process and controls where appropriate. 
Therefore the synthesis of the active substance and the manufacture of the product are under control 
and  can  deliver  a  consistently  high  quality  active  substance  or  product,  controlled  from  batch  to 
batch by relevant and validated test methodology and specification limits. 
2.3 Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
A range of in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to investigate the primary and secondary 
pharmacology  of  eltrombopag,  including  a  battery  of  safety  pharmacology  studies.  Absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion studies have been performed with eltrombopag to assess the 
suitability of the animal species used during toxicological evaluation. 
As claimed by the applicant, all safety pharmacology studies, a number of pharmacokinetic studies 
and  all  pivotal  toxicity  studies  (including  the  toxicokinetic  investigations)  were  carried  out  in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. All other studies were conducted in 
line  with  Company  Divisional  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  Policies,  and  in  general 
accordance with the principles of GLP.

Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
In vitro studies 
In  murine  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (BAF3)-TPO  cells  stably  transfected  with  human  TPO-R 
eltrombopag  half  maximal  effective  concentration  (EC50)  was  0.27  μM,  and  in  32D-mpl  cells 
(murine cells transfected with human TPO-R and gpIIb promoter linked to luciferase) the EC50 was 
0.1μM.  
Activation of the STAT and MAPK pathways by eltrombopag was observed using phospho-specific 
antibodies  in  western  blots.  Eltrombopag  (10  μM)  stimulated  STAT  3  and  STAT5  (STAT-based 
transduction  pathways)  and  activated  p42/44  MAPK,  with  a  similar  kinetics  to  that  observed  for 
TPO.  However,  eltrombopag  was  only able  to  induce  minimal  phosphorylation  of  STAT 1 and  no 
phosphorylation of AKT. In addition to activation of the STAT and MAPK signal transduction paths, 
the expression of certain early response genes associated with proliferation and TPO activation, i.e., 
Fos, EGR-1 and thyroid-like receptor 3 was upregulated following treatment with eltrombopag (30 
μM). 
Eltrombopag induced proliferation of a megakaryocyte cell line (N2C-TPO, also named UT7/TPO) 
with an EC50 of 0.03 μM. Eltrombopag also showed to be able to increase differentiation of human 
CD 34+ marrow progenitor cells into CD41+ megakaryocytic cells in a dose dependent manner with 
an  EC50  of  0.1  μM.  Megakaryocyte  differentiation  equivalent  to  that  observed  following  treatment 
with  TPO  (0.1  μg/mL)  was  observed  at  an  eltrombopag  concentration  of  3  μM.  Comparison  of 
eltrombopag potency with TPO potency in terms of EC50 (μM) showed that TPO is between 7 to 9 
orders  of  magnitude  more  potent  than  eltrombopag  in  the  CD34+  megakaryocyte  differentiation 
assay,  as  well  as  in  the  N2C-TPO  proliferation  assay.  When  comparing  the  maximum  effect 
achieved by TPO and eltrombopag in these two assays, maximum eltrombopag effect is between 95 
and 155% the maximum effect achieved by TPO. 
Eltrombopag showed an additive effect with TPO on STAT activation, and in a proliferation assay in 
N2C-TPO cells. In an apoptosis assay, both eltrombopag and TPO were additive in their ability to 
prevent cell death; the level of maximal activity was demonstrated at 0.1 μg/mL TPO and at 0.3 μM 
eltrombopag. 
There was no activity of eltrombopag (over a 3 log concentration range) in the BAF3 parental line 
and in additional proliferation, reporter gene or STAT activation assays in cells that did not express 
TPO-R  but  that  utilize  STAT  signalling  pathways  (UT7-EPO,  BAF3/GCSFR,  HepG2  and  BAF 
parental). 
Eltrombopag  inhibited  the  proliferation  of  fifteen  out  of  seventeen  leukaemia  and  lymphoma  cell 
lines (IC50 = 0.56 to 15.4 μg/mL) and of liver cancer cell line HepG2 (IC50= 5.61 μg/mL). The cell 
lines  NOMO-1  and  OCI-M1  (AML)  were  resistant  to  eltrombopag  with  IC50  >  40  μg/mL,  the 
maximum  tested  dose.  Other  two  cell  lines  N2C-TPO  and  HEL  92.1.7,  demonstrated  increased 
proliferation  at  eltrombopag  concentrations  from  0.006  to  1.7  μg/mL,  and  0.1  to  0.4  μg/mL, 
respectively. Additional studies were performed in other tumour cell lines which included 4 different 
lung carcinoma cell lines, 2 prostate tumour cell lines and 3 ovarian tumour cell lines. There was no 
increase in proliferation of any of the additional cell lines tested. 
TPO-R mRNA expression was low in the majority of the 376 tumour cell lines tested, as measured 
by qRT-PCR. Nevertheless, two AML cell lines, HEL 92.1.7 and KG-1, and the lung carcinoma cell 
line NCI-H510 had greater than 9500 normalized abundance for TPO-R mRNA. 
In contrast to TPO, eltrombopag (1 to 10 μM) has no direct effect on in vitro platelet aggregation or 
activation,  nor  does  it  influence  the  ability  of  ADP  (3  μM),  collagen  (2  μg/mL)  or  the  thrombin 
receptor activating peptide (TRAP) (20 μM) to induce platelet aggregation. 
9/79 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Eltrombopag showed a marked specificity for human and chimpanzee TPO-R. The transmembrane 
domain  and  amino  acid  residue  His499  in  particular,  was  demonstrated  to  be  necessary  for 
eltrombopag/TPO-R  interaction.  Threonine  492  and  zinc  also  contribute  to  the  in  vitro  activity  of 
eltrombopag in transient transfection models as well. 
In vivo studies 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo studies were performed in chimpanzees. Five daily doses of 10 
mg/kg/day  produced  increases  between  1.3-  to  2.4-  fold  in  platelet  counts  approximately  1  week 
after the last dose and returned to baseline values within 2 weeks. A similar trend was observed in 
reticulated platelet counts. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The selectivity of eltrombopag was assessed in a panel of standard in vitro radio-ligand binding and 
enzyme  activity  assays  against  41  physiologically  relevant  receptors,  enzymes  and  ion  channels. 
Eltrombopag  showed  activity  (defined  as  >  25%  inhibition) on 4  targets: α2B-receptor  (38%,  IC50= 
15.5  μM),  I2-receptor  (88%,  IC50=  1.7  μM),  oestrogen-α-receptor  (85%,  IC50=  0.3  μM)  and 
oestrogen-β-receptor (33%, IC50= 1.9  μM). 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
- In vitro studies on the effect on cardiac ion channels:  
The  effects  of  eltrombopag  (10  or  25  μM)  on  action  potential  duration  at  30%,  60%  and  90% 
repolarisation,  maximum  rate  of  depolarization  (MRD),  upstroke  amplitude  (UA)  and  resting 
membrane  potential  (RMP)  were  investigated  in  isolated  dog  Purkinje  fibres  paced  at  stimulation 
frequencies of 1 and 0.5 Hz. In fibres paced at 3 Hz (control and 25 μM), only MRD was measured. 
In fibres stimulated at frequencies of 0.5 and 1 Hz, exposure to eltrombopag at concentrations of 10 
and  25  μM  had  no  effects  on  resting  membrane  potential  and  action  potential  duration  at  30% 
repolarisation. In the presence of 10 μM (4.4 μg/mL) and 25 μM (11.1 μg/mL) eltrombopag induced 
decreases  in  maximum  rate  of  depolarization,  upstroke  amplitude  and  action  potential  duration  at 
60% and 90% repolarisation. The effects on MRD at 1 and 0.5 Hz suggested that eltrombopag may 
produce a tonic inhibition of cardiac sodium channels. 
A  study  was  conducted  to  measure  the  effect  of  eltrombopag  on  hERG  currents  recorded  from 
HEK293 cells stably transfected with hERG-1 cDNA. A series of concentrations up to the maximum 
soluble concentration of eltrombopag (21.7 μM) were tested. E-4031 (0.1 μM), a known inhibitor of 
the IKr , current was used as a reference substance. Eltrombopag was found to inhibit hERG channel 
tail  current  in  a  concentration-  dependent  manner.  The  nominal  IC25,  IC50  and  IC75  values  were 
estimated to be 0.09, 0.69 and 5.13 μM, respectively. 
In vivo studies 
- Overt Central and Peripheral Effects: 
Male Sprague Dawley rats (10 per group) were administered eltrombopag as single oral doses at 0, 3, 
10  or  40  mg/kg.  Eltrombopag  did  not  affect  any  of  the  measures  of  the  functional  observational 
battery (FOB). The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for this study is 40 mg/kg (6-fold the 
maximum proposed human Cmax of eltrombopag when administered at 75 mg/day (12.7 μg/mL). 
- Actions on Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems: 
Conscious male Sprague Dawley rats (n=4) were administered eltrombopag as single oral doses at 0, 
3, 10 and 40 mg/kg on separate days in a crossover study design with 7 days between treatments.  
10/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ventilatory  parameters  (tidal  volume,  respiratory  rate  and  minute  volume)  and  airway  resistance 
(total  pulmonary  resistance)  were  recorded  before  dosing,  around the  times  of  Cmax  (1  and  4  hours 
post  dose)  and  at  approximately  24  and  48  hours  post  dose.  Eltrombopag  did  not  produce  any 
adverse  effect  on  respiratory  function  in  the  male  rat.  The  no-observed-adverse-effect-level 
(NOAEL) for this study is 40 mg/kg. 
Conscious male Beagle Dogs (n=4) were administered eltrombopag as single oral doses at 0, 3, 10 
and 30 mg/kg on separate days in a crossover study design with 7 days between treatments. 
Eltrombopag  had  no  effect  on  arterial  blood  pressures,  heart  rate  or  ECG  intervals  during  the  48 
hours  post  dose.  There  was  no  evidence  of  ECG  waveform  abnormalities  or  arrhythmias  in  ECG 
tracings at tmax (1 hour post dose), and at approximately 4, 24 and 48 hours post dose. Additionally 
no evidence of cardiac abnormalities was observed in dogs in the 52 week repeat dose study at doses 
up to 30 mg/kg/day (3-fold higher exposure than expected at maximum human dose). 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies have been submitted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
toxicokinetic 
investigations,  plasma  samples  were  analyzed  for 
For  pharmacokinetic  and 
eltrombopag  (parent  compound)  by  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass 
spectrometry  (HPLC/MS/MS)  analysis,  preceded  by  protein  precipitation.  The  lower  limit  of 
quantification for eltrombopag was 10 ng/mL and the higher limit of quantification was 2500 ng/mL 
using a 50 μL plasma sample. 
Determination of the radioactivity in biological samples following the administration of 14C-labelled 
eltrombopag was carried out by either direct liquid scintillation counting (LSC) or by LSC following 
combustion of the sample. For radioactivity levels in tissues, whole body autoradiographic technique 
with quantitative imaging was used. The profiling and identification of metabolites of eltrombopag 
was  performed  using  a  variety  of  techniques  including  HPLC  with  radiochemical  and  ultraviolet 
(UV)  detection,  liquid  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS),  liquid  chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and/or NMR analysis. 
•  Absorption 
Following  single  intravenous  administration,  plasma  clearance  of  eltrombopag  (parent  compound) 
was 0.45 mL/min/kg in rats, 0.44 mL/min/kg in dogs and 3.3 mL/min/kg in monkeys, with half-lives 
of 12, 14 and 7.7 hours, respectively. Volume of distribution corresponded to 2 times the total body 
water in the monkey (1.39 L/kg), but less than one-half total body water in rats and dogs (0.196 L/kg 
and 0.47 L/kg, respectively).  
Following a single oral administration in solution, eltrombopag was more quickly absorbed in rats, 
dogs,  or  humans  (tmax  of  1.35  to  2.5  hours)  than  in  the  monkey  (tmax  of  4.25  hours).  In  mice,  tmax 
values ranged from 1 to 4 hours. 
Oral bioavailability of eltrombopag (parent compound) when administered in solution was between 
12 to 34% in rats, 83% in dogs and 89% in monkeys. In dogs, when administered in a capsule, the 
oral bioavailability of eltrombopag was higher when given as the bis-monoethanolamine salt (48%) 
than  that  following  administration  of  the  parent  compound  (21%).  When  comparing  oral 
bioavailability  of  eltrombopag  (parent  compound)  administered  in  solution,  suspension  or  in  a 
capsule, the highest bioavailability was for the solution, being F values of 83%, 15.8% and 7.09%, 
respectively. 
11/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repeat administration of the salting agent, monoethanolamine, at 32.4 mg/kg/day to mice for 7 days 
(equivalent  to  eltrombopag  bis-monoethanolamine  salt  at  150  mg/kg/day)  did  not  increase 
monoethanolamine above normal endogenous levels in plasma. 
In  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  eltrombopag  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs,  systemic 
exposures of eltrombopag increased with dose (approximately proportionally in mice and dogs, but 
greater  than  proportionally  in  rats).  In  juvenile  rats  systemic  exposures  of  eltrombopag  decreased 
with dose.  There were no marked differences in systemic exposure between males and females and 
no consistent indication of accumulation upon repeat administration in any species. In general there 
were  no  differences  in  exposure  between  pigmented  and  non-pigmented  animals.  In  embryofoetal 
development  studies  in  rabbits,  systemic  exposures  of  eltrombopag  increased  above  dose-
proportionally. 
•  Distribution 
Eltrombopag-related  material  was  widely  distributed  into  peripheral  tissues  in  mice  and  rats, 
although  higher  levels  were  generally  associated  with  tissues  involved  in  absorption  and/or 
elimination  (gastrointestinal  tract,  liver  and  renal  cortex);  the  concentrations  in  most  tissues  were 
lower than in blood. Drug-related material did not extensively penetrate into central nervous system 
or  the  lens  of  the  eye,  nor  was  it  selectively  retained  in  melanin  containing  tissues.  There  was  no 
evidence of tissue accumulation of drug-related material in mice, including eyes, kidneys and skin, 
although  the  levels  of  the  radioactivity  in  the  tissues  after  repeated  administration  in  rats  were 
slightly higher and declined slower than those observed following a single dose. 
Eltrombopag was highly bound to plasma proteins in mouse (93.7%-99.8%), and very highly bound 
(99.0%-99.8%) in rats, dogs, monkeys and humans; with low association to blood cells.  
•  Metabolism 
Following incubation of [14C]eltrombopag with human liver microsomes and supersomes resulted in 
the formation of metabolite J (a mono-oxygenation product of eltrombopag). CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 
were the primary enzymes involved in the in vitro oxidative metabolism of eltrombopag. UGT1A1 
and  UGT1A3  metabolized  eltrombopag  to  form  metabolite  K  (glucuronide  conjugate).    Following 
incubation  of  [14C]eltrombopag  with  human  hepatocytes,  the  major  metabolic  pathways  observed 
were  conjugation  with  glucuronic  acid  (metabolite  K)  or  cysteine  (metabolite  G).  Other  minor 
pathways were conjugation with glutathione (metabolite F) and oxidation that led to formation of an 
M+14  metabolite.  Additional  metabolites  detected  included  metabolite  J  (mono-oxygenated)  and 
metabolite  O  (oxidation  of  a  methyl  to  a  carboxylic  acid).  Human  kidney  microsomes  exhibited 
minimal capacity to metabolize eltrombopag in vitro. 
The metabolic profiles of eltrombopag in vitro were qualitatively similar in rats, dogs and monkeys. 
There  has  been  no  evidence  for  the  formation  of  any  human  specific  metabolites.  In  vivo 
eltrombopag  was  the  predominant  circulating  component  in  all  species.  In  rats  there  was  adequate 
coverage for the circulating metabolites in humans. M14 which accounts for a 20% in human urine 
excretion was present up to 9.2% in mice urine but was not detected in rats and information is not 
available in dogs.  
•  Excretion 
Eltrombopag  was  primarily  eliminated  as  unchanged  drug  in  the  faeces  with  renal  elimination  of 
cleavage products contributing as a minor route. Gut microbes readily cleaved eltrombopag based on 
in vitro incubation of eltrombopag with human faeces and mouse and rat cecal contents in anaerobic 
conditions.  Qualitatively,  all  of  the  major  metabolites  of  eltrombopag  observed  in  humans  were 
observed in the non-clinical species. 
•  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies show that eltrombopag was an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 with IC50 values of 
24.8  and  20.2  μM,  respectively,  but  was  not  an  inhibitor  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11 at concentrations up to 100 μM.  
12/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eltrombopag was only a weak activator of human Pregnane X receptor (PXR) with low efficacy and 
was  not  an  activator  of  rat  PXR.  Furthermore,  in  conjunction  with  oral  toxicity  studies,  repeat 
administration  of  eltrombopag  for  up  to  14  days  did  not  result  in  notable  changes  in  activities  of 
CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2E, CYP3A and CYP4A in rat or dog. Eltrombopag did not cause induction 
of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in cultured human hepatocytes. 
Eltrombopag  was  found  to  be  an  in  vitro  inhibitor  of  several  uridine  diphosphate  glucuronosyl 
transferases (UGTs) with IC50s ranging from 3 to 30 μM (UGT1A9, UGT1A3, UGT1A1, UGT2B15, 
UGT1A6, UGT2B7 and UGT1A4).  
In vitro eltrombopag is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. According to the Applicant, only 21% 
of the dose could be subjected to hepatic conversion mediated by CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. 
Eltrombopag was neither an inhibitor nor a substrate of human Pgp and was not a substrate of human 
OATP1B1, although it was an inhibitor of this transporter and the potential for such an interaction 
was confirmed clinically following co-administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin (a substrate 
of OATP1B1 and BCRP). Eltrombopag inhibited OATP1B1-mediated uptake of [3H]estradiol 17β-
D-glucuronide  with  and  IC50  of  2.71  μM.  In  addition,  eltrombopag  was  an  in  vitro  inhibitor  and  a 
substrate  of  human  BCRP.  Eltrombopag  inhibited  also  BCRP-mediated  transport  of  cimetidine  in 
vitro with an IC50 of 2.7 μM. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of eltrombopag has been investigated in a battery of studies including a single 
dose study in dogs, repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in mice, 28 weeks in rats and 52 
weeks  in  dogs,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies,  reproductive  toxicity  studies  and  local 
tolerance studies. Pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with GLP regulations. 
•  Single dose toxicity 
Beagle dogs (n= 1 male and 1 female) were administered a single oral dose of eltrombopag at 100 or 
300 mg/kg, 7 days apart, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in dogs by the oral route. 
A  dose  of  100  mg/kg  was  tolerated  with  clinical  signs  limited  to  slight  reductions  in  food 
consumption  and  body  weight  (4  to  7%).  A  dose  of  300  mg/kg  was  poorly-tolerated  and  was 
associated  with  emesis,  abnormal  stool  consistency,  decreased  activity,  inappetence  and  moderate 
body weight reduction.  
Toxicokinetic data were determined on Days 1 and 8 – pre-dose, and approximately 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 
and 72 hours post-dose. A 3-fold increase in dose supposed a more than dose proportional increase in 
exposure in the male dog (~ 5-fold), and a 3-fold decrease in exposure in the female dog.  Exposures 
ranged  from  12.6-fold  to  86-fold  the  maximum  proposed  clinical  exposure  (exposure  margins  are 
presented based upon comparison of the animal systemic exposure with that reported for ITP patients 
receiving  the  maximum  proposed  oral  therapeutic  dose  of  75  mg/day  eltrombopag:  AUC=  168 
μg.h/mL, Cmax= 12.7 μg/mL).  
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
The  toxicity  of  repeated  oral  doses  of  eltrombopag  has  been  assessed  in  mice  (5  studies),  rats  (6 
studies),  rabbits  (2  studies)  and  dogs  (4  studies)  in  studies  of  up  to  13,  28,  1  and  52  weeks, 
respectively. In addition, repeat dose toxicity was assessed in 2 year carcinogenicity studies in mice. 
The major findings are summarised in Table 2.

a: Due to mortality, 300 mg/kg/day was discontinued at Week 3. In females, 150 mg/kg/day was lowered to 115 mg/kg/day at Week 21 due to clinical signs. 
Dosing in both males at 150 mg/kg/day and females at 150/115 mg/kg/day was discontinued at Week 43 and the animals were euthanized at Week 64.  
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
The  effects  of  eltrombopag  on  fertility  and  general  reproductive  performance,  peri-  and  post-natal 
development and juvenile toxicity have been investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats, while the effects 
on  embryofoetal  development  have  been  investigated  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  and  New  Zealand 
white rabbits. 
In  a  male  fertility  study  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats  testicular  weights  were  slightly  increased  at  40 
mg/kg/day, but there were no effects of eltrombopag on mating and fertility of the treated males, nor 
any  effects  on  survival,  growth  or  external  morphology  of  the  foetuses  sired  by  the  treated  males. 
The no observed adverse effect dose for male fertility in this study was 40 mg/kg/day. In a rat repeat 
dose oral toxicity study for up to 10 days vacuolar changes in the testes were noted at 40 and 120 
mg/kg/day, as well as spermatid retention/ degeneration at 120 mg/kg/day eltrombopag (2.3- to 5.1-
fold  greater  than  the  maximum  proposed  clinical  exposure).    These  were  not  associated  with 
systemic toxicity. 
In  a  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats,  decreases  in 
maternal  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  noted  at  60  mg/kg/day  (6.2-fold  the 
maximum proposed clinical exposure). Embryotoxicity was observed at 60 mg/kg/day in the form of 
increased pre- and post-implantation loss (leading to a 27% decrease in live litter size) and a 20% to 
21% decrease in foetal weight. Under the conditions of this study, the No Observed Adverse Effect 
Level  (NOAEL)  for  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  was  20  mg/kg/day  (2-fold  the 
maximum proposed clinical exposure). 
In one embryofoetal development study in rat, animals given eltrombopag orally at 60 mg/kg/day for 
11 days, showed decreased maternal body weight (9%) and food consumption (8%-11%), as well as 
decreased foetal weights in males and females (6%-7%), and increased incidence of cervical ribs. No 
test  article-related  changes  were  observed  for  any  caesarean  section  parameters  (corpora  lutea, 
implants,  pre-  and  post-  implantation  loss  and  number  of  live  foetuses).  These  studies  were 
performed at 60 mg/kg/day eltrombopag, 6.2-fold the maximum proposed clinical exposure. 
One embryofoetal development study was performed in New Zealand rabbits. Eltrombopag did not 
produce effects on uterine or teratogenicity parameters. 
In  a  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  in  rats,  there  were  no  adverse  effects  on  pregnancy, 
parturition or lactation of female rats and no effects on the growth, development, neurobehavioral or 
reproductive function of the offspring at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. 
Two juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in rat pups dosed eltrombopag from Days 4 to 32 pp. 
At doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (2274 μg.h/mL, 13.5-fold the maximum proposed clinical exposure) some 
deaths occurred, as well as evident toxicity clinical signs (decreased activity, weakness, thinness and 
cold  to  touch).  Pale  yellow  discoloration  of  the  fur/skin,  carcass,  salivary  gland  and  thymus, 
revealing  hepatic  affectation,  was  reverted  in  the  30  mg/kg/day  dose  group  during  the  4  week 
recovery period. Ocular opacities were noted grossly in five animals in the  middle dose group (30 
mg/kg/day). There were no treatment related findings at 10 mg/kg/day (977 μg.h/mL; 5.8- fold the 
maximum proposed clinical exposure). 
In one of the studies there was a slight decrease in red blood cell count, haemoglobin, and mean cell 
haemoglobin  concentration  values  for  males,  a  slight  increase  in  absolute  reticulocyte  counts  for 
females, and slight increases in red cell distribution width for males and females at 15 mg/kg/day.  
Due  to  age-dependent  development  of  hepatic  excretory  pathways,  and  additional  juvenile  toxicity 
study was conducted at higher doses in slightly older rats. Pups were dosed eltrombopag orally once 
daily from Day 32 to 63 post partum. There were no deaths or treatment-related effects on clinical 
17/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observations, body weight, food consumption or ophthalmology at doses up to 40 mg/kg /day. At the 
highest  dose  group  (40  mg/kg/day),  effects  on  red  blood  cell  parameters  to  the  same  extent  than 
observed in the previous study in younger pups were also noted. In this case, these findings were not 
considered adverse.  
At 40 mg/kg/day dose group, increased urinary protein was noted in males, It was considered to be 
related to an increased incidence of tubular hyaline droplets observed in the kidneys of males given 
15  and  40  mg/kg/day.  Immunohistochemical  staining  indicated  that  the  hyaline  droplets  contained 
alpha-2  microglobulin,  a  male-rat  specific  protein.  Changes  were  only  accompanied  by  slight 
proteinuria and were not accompanied by histologic evidence of renal damage. 
As a conclusion from these three studies, toxicity was observed at lower eltrombopag doses in the 
youngest animals dosed from Day 4 to 32 pp (NOAEL: 10-15 mg/kg/day), when compared to older 
animals, administered from Day 32 to 63 pp (NOAEL: 40 mg/kg/day).  
•  Local tolerance  
Local  tolerance  studies  included  in  vitro  ocular  and  dermal  irritancy  studies  and  an  ex  vivo  ocular 
irritancy assay. Eltrombopag was considered not to be skin irritant but a severe ocular irritant. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
An in vivo study on skin sensitisation potential in the mouse local lymph node assay was submitted. 
Eltrombopag was considered to be a non-sensitizer under the conditions of this assay.  
Immunotoxicity 
A study was performed to investigate the effects of eltrombopag on the primary antibody response to 
T-cell dependent antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). There was no treatment-related effect 
on  immunology  parameters  in  females.  Male  rats  in  the  highest  dose  group  showed  a  decrease  in 
group geometric mean anti-KLH IgM antibody concentration, compared to the male control group (3 
versus 19 μg/mL; p≤0.01). The decrease in anti-KLH IgM response in the 40 mg/kg/day male group 
is considered related to drug treatment; however, whether it is a direct drug effect or secondary to the 
slight  decrease  (12  and  15%)  in  body  weight  gain  at  the  time  of  immunization  and  IgM 
measurement,  is  uncertain.  The  finding is  considered  non-adverse  based  on  nominal  differences  in 
anti-KLH  IgG  response  which  were  neither  statistically  nor  biologically  significant  in  the  40 
mg/kg/day  male  group,  compared  to  controls.  In  conclusion,  eltrombopag  at  doses  up  to  40 
mg/kg/day does not adversely affect immune function.  
Phototoxicity 
Eltrombopag was demonstrated to be phototoxic in vitro (3T3 NRU phototoxicity test).  
There was no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity in SKH1-hr mice at ~1 hour, 4 hours (tmax) and 3 
days post UVR exposure (dose equivalent to ~ 0.5 MED) at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day  for 14 days 
(Cmax of 167 μg/mL and AUC of 1607 μg.h/mL, corresponding to 13.1- and  9.5- fold maximum 
proposed clinical exposure, respectively). 
Studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  phototoxic  potential  of  eltrombopag  on  the  eyes  of 
pigmented  and  non-pigmented  (albino)  mice  and  rats.  The  overall  incidence  and  progression  of 
cataracts  was  generally  increased  in  pigmented  female  mice  (B6C3F1)  versus  albino  female  mice 
(CD-1) given eltrombopag (100 or 150 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks, with or without UVR exposure (0.6 
MED/day or 3 MED/week). There were 6 deaths (6 out of 35) in albino mice given 150 mg/kg/day 
eltrombopag  (3  exposed  and  3  no  exposed).  No  adverse  clinical  observations  or  deaths  related  to 
treatment were noted in pigmented mice 
18/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  adverse  ophthalmological  or  histological  findings  were  noted  in  eyes  of  male  Long  Evans 
(pigmented) and Sprague Dawley (albino) rats given 40 mg/kg/day eltrombopag orally for 14 days 
followed by a single UVR exposure (∼0.5 MED). 
Renal effects 
A  four-week  investigative study  on  potential  eltrombopag-induced  renal  toxicity  was  performed  in 
female CD-1  mice (n=12/group; ~ 11 weeks of age at the start of dosing). Eltrombopag dose: 150 
mg/kg/day,  p.o.,  for  4  weeks;  or  250  mg/kg/day,  p.o.,  for  11  days.  Toxicokinetics:  additional  20 
animals/group. 
Mortality and deteriorating clinical condition at 250 mg/kg/day between Days 9 and 11 resulted in 
the  early  termination  (Day  11)  of  the  remainder  of  that  group.  Renal  findings  associated  with  the 
spontaneous  syndrome  of  chronic  nephropathy  in  mice,  tubular  basophilia  and  interstitial 
inflammatory  infiltrates  were  present  in  eltrombopag-treated  mice  at  an  increased  incidence  (0 
control vs. 6 mice given 150 mg/kg/day, Day 28) and tubular casts were present at 250 mg/kg/day at 
an increased number and localization (cortex and medulla vs. confined to the medulla in controls or 
mice  given  150  mg/kg/day).  Eltrombopag-related  tubular  degeneration,  tubular  dilation  and/or 
regenerative  changes  were  observed  at  low  incidence  (approximately  20%)  and  minimal  to  mild 
severity at doses of 150 or 250 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure was similar (AUC ≈ 2300 μg.h/mL) at 
doses of 150 mg/kg/day on Day 28 or 250 mg/kg/day on Day 11. tmax occurred at 8 or 2 hours post 
dose at 150 or 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
A  second  investigative  study  on  potential  eltrombopag-induced  renal  toxicity  was  performed  in 
female  CD-1  mice  (n=40/group;  ~  6  weeks  of  age  at  the  start  of  dosing).  Eltrombopag  dose:  150 
mg/kg/day  p.o.,  for  up  to  28  or  32  weeks.  Mice  given  150  mg/kg/day  had  decreased  body  weight 
gain and 4 of 40 mice died or were euthanized in moribund condition (following 81 to 193 doses of 
eltrombopag; Weeks 12 to 28). Degeneration and necrosis noted in cortical and medullar tubules of 3 
of  these  mice  were  considered  secondary  changes  associated  with  moribundity  and  vascular 
compromise. Increases in urine protein-to-urine creatinine ratios (up to 3.9X control) were observed 
in  mice  given  150  mg/kg/day  following  87  to  196  days  of  dosing  (Weeks  13  to  28).  Tubular 
basophilia,  inflammatory  infiltrates  within  interstitial  and  tubular  casts,  associated  with  the 
spontaneous syndrome of chronic nephropathy in  mice, were found in both the treated and control 
group with no differences in the incidence and severity, which increased with age. There were no test 
article-related microscopic renal findings following up to 193 days of dosing. 
Studies on impurities 
A review of the synthetic route for eltrombopag and possible degradation chemistry of reagents used 
therein  highlighted  a  number  of  synthetic  intermediates  and  degradation  products  as  potential 
genotoxins: SB-611855-AAB, SB-601205, SB-564758, GSK560666A and SB-710620-A. 
SB-611855-AAB and SB-601205 were negative in Ames bacterial mutation assays in the presence 
and absence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix) when tested up to 5000 μg/plate. SB-564758, 
an isolated intermediate, was not mutagenic in an Ames assay in the presence and absence of S9-mix 
at  up  to  5000 μg/plate  but  was  clastogenic  in  an  in  vitro  chromosomal  aberration  assay  in  human 
lymphocytes  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  S9-mix.  SB-564758  was  negative  in  a  rat  oral 
micronucleus  assay  at  doses  up  to  600 mg/kg/day.  Based  on  these  findings,  SB-611855-AAB, 
SB-601205 and SB-564758 are considered non-genotoxic impurities. 
SB-710620-A  and  GSK560666A  were  positive  in  an  in  vitro  bacterial  mutation  HTFT  (high 
throughput fluctuation test) mutagenicity screen. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Using the Phase I calculation without marketing penetration factor (Fpen) refinement for prediction 
of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC), the calculated PEC for eltrombopag (0.35 μg/l) 
was  above  the  trigger  value  of  0.01  μg/l.  According  to  published  epidemiological  data 
19/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Abrahamson  et  al.  2009),  an  incidence  of  0.39  in  10,000  is  equivalent  to  0.0039%  of  the 
population  and  use  of  this  refined  figure  in  the  standard  Phase  I  calculation  of  worst  case  PEC 
would give a PEC value of 0.0015 µg/L which is significantly below the nominal trigger value of 
0.01 µg/L. 
The study OECD 107 for the determination of logKow showed a log Kow above 4.5 at pH7.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The in vitro inhibitory effects on α2B, I2-, oestrogen-α- and oestrogen-β-receptors were not correlated 
with in vivo findings in clinical trials or in non-clinical species at exposures approximately 3- to 6-
fold  maximum  clinical  exposure  (based  on  AUC  and  Cmax).  The  potential  for  secondary 
pharmacodynamic effects on these receptors in patients receiving eltrombopag is unlikely and thus, 
potential interactions associated with a particular medical condition or with concomitant medications 
are not expected. 
According  to  Guideline  3BS1a  on  Single  dose  Toxicity,  single-dose  toxicity  studies  must  be 
conducted  on  at  least  two  mammalian  species.  For  eltrombopag  only  one  study  in  dogs  was 
performed. According to the same Guideline, two different routes of administration should be used. 
In  the  only  study  provided,  eltrombopag  was  just  administered  orally,  the  intended  route  for  man. 
However, this approach has been considered acceptable based on the battery of repeat dose toxicity 
studies provided. 
The  principal  toxicological  findings  associated  with  eltrombopag  administration  include  cataracts 
(mice and rats), renal toxicity (mice) and hepatotoxicity (mice, rats and dogs). In vitro phototoxicity 
(3T3 and CHO cells) has also been observed. This information has been addressed in section 5.3 of 
the SPC. 
Observed  effects  on  red  blood  cells  including  decreased  reticulocyte  counts  (in  rats  and  dogs)  and 
regenerative  bone  marrow  erythroid  hyperplasia  (rats  only)  observed  in  short  term  studies  and 
endosteal hyperostosis (rats only) have been addressed in section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (included in section 5.3 of the SPC). Studies in 
animals  have  shown  that  eltrombopag  is  likely  secreted  into  milk,  therefore  a  risk  to  the  suckling 
child cannot be excluded and a warning has been included in section 4.6 of the SPC.  
Study OECD 107 for the determination of logKow presented in the ERA showed a log Kow above 4.5 
at pH7; therefore a PBT-assessment is necessary. The substance should be screened in a step-wise 
procedure  for  persistence  (OECD  308),  toxicity  (OECD  210,  OECD  211)  and  bioaccumulation 
(OECD 305) and the Applicant has committed to submit these studies as a follow up measure. 
2.4 Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Two Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies RAISE (TRA102537) and 
TRA100773B and two open-label studies REPEAT (TRA108057) and EXTEND (TRA105325) 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in adult patients with previously treated chronic 
ITP.  Overall, eltrombopag was administered to 277 patients for at least 6 months and 202 patients 
for at least 1 year. 
The therapeutic indication for Revolade claimed by the Applicant was: Revolade is indicated for the 
treatment of previously treated patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to 
increase platelet counts and reduce or prevent bleeding. 
The approved therapeutic indication is: Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. 
20/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered as second line treatment for adult 
non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated. 
The  Applicant  received  Protocol  Assistance  from  the  CHMP  on  clinical  aspects  of  the  dossier 
focusing on the study design for the pivotal trials.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

•  Methods 
Analytical methods 
Plasma  samples  were  analysed  for  eltrombopag  using  a  method  based  on  protein  precipitation, 
followed  by  high  performance 
tandem  mass  spectrometry 
(HPLC/MS/MS)  analysis.  Data  on  BQL,  within  and  between-run  precision,  accuracy  and  sample 
stability show values within the accepted range of suitability for a human plasma analysis. 
liquid  chromatography  with 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  firstly  explored  on  the  basis  of  an  individual  approach  by  using  non-
compartmental  PK  analysis  (WinNonlin  software).  Population  pharmacokinetic  methods,  using  the 
program  NONMEM VI,  have also been used to analyse PK data from 5  studies: 3 Phase I studies 
(TRA102860, TRA105580, SB-487115/002), 1 Phase II study (TRA100773A) and 1 Phase III study 
(TRA100773B). 
Statistical analyses conducted with PK data were standard and appropriate in each case. 
•  Absorption 
The  plasma  eltrombopag  concentration-time  data  was  collected  in  88  subjects  with  ITP  in  Studies 
TRA100773A  and  TRA100773B  (see  Table  5).  Plasma  eltrombopag  concentrations  were 
quantifiable  within  approximately  1  h,  with  peak  concentrations  occurring  2  to  6h  after  oral 
administration  of  single  and  repeat  doses  of  eltrombopag.  The  plasma  elimination  half  life  of 
eltrombopag is approximately 21 to 32 h.

Plasma  eltrombopag  AUC  and  Cmax  increased  with  increasing  dose  and  the  evaluation  of 
proportionality was dose dependent. Plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-τ) increased in a dose proportional 
manner between 50 mg and 200 mg; Cmax increased in a dose proportional manner between 50 mg 
and 150 mg. At doses below 50 mg, plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞) and Cmax increased in a greater 
than  dose-proportional  manner.  Between-subject  variability  (%CVb)  in  AUC  and  Cmax  was 
generally between 30 and 40%. 
A population PK analysis was performed using the data from 111 healthy subjects from three Phase I 
studies  (TRA102860,  TRA105580,  SB-497115/002)  and  88  ITP  patients  from  one  Phase  II  study 
(TRA100773A) and one Phase III study (TRA100773B). The PK of eltrombopag following single- 
and  repeat-oral  administration  were  adequately  described  by  a  linear  2-compartment  model  with 
absorption  lag  time,  dual  sequential  first  order  absorption,  inter-occasion  variability  on  absorption 
and first order elimination. The absorption rate constant at 1.9 hours post dose increased from 0.5 hr-
1 to 10.4 hr-1, indicating that eltrombopag absorption rate is much faster in the small intestine than 
in  the  stomach.  The  estimated  mean  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI))  parameter  values  for  an  ITP 
male Caucasian patient that weighed 70 kg and did not take corticosteroids are shown in Table 6.

Table 6: Final estimates of the population PK model  
In healthy subjects receiving eltrombopag once daily for 10 days, the accumulation ratio (90% CI) 
was 1.44 (1.20,1.63) for 50 mg once daily and 1.56 (1.23,1.97) for 75 mg once daily. Eltrombopag 
demonstrated time-invariant PK over the dose range of 5 mg to 75 mg administered once daily for 10 
days.  Based  on  a  population  PK  analysis,  the  apparent  oral  clearance  for  eltrombopag  was,  on 
average, 17% higher in healthy subjects as compared to patients with chronic ITP. 
Influence of food  
The absorption of eltrombopag was significantly reduced when administered with the standard high-
fat  breakfast  with  milk  (corresponding  to  427mg  calcium);  whereas,  low-calcium  meals  (<50mg 
calcium),  regardless  of  fat  content,  had  minimal  impact  on  plasma  eltrombopag  exposure.  In 
addition,  the  absorption  of  eltrombopag  was  significantly  reduced  when  co-administered  with  a 
polyvalent cation-containing antacid. 
•  Distribution 
Distribution was well characterized in the final population PK model by assuming a 2-compartment 
PK model. Thus, two volumes of distribution have to be estimated as fixed parameters: volume of 
central  compartment  (Vc/F)  and  volume  of  the  peripheral  compartment  (Vp/F).  Interindividual 
random  effects  (IIV)  on  both  were  firstly  included  using  exponential  models  with  a  diagonal 
variance  –covariance  matrix.  The  apparent  volumes  of  distribution  for  the  Vc/F  and  Vp/F 
compartments were estimated to be low (8.76L and 11.3L, respectively). IIV on Vp/F resulted to be 
quite  high: 45%.  Correlation  between CL/F  and  Vc/F  was  also  included  in  the  final  popPK  model 
(0.81). Weight and low dose (< 20 mg) were the most significant determinants on apparent volume 
of the central compartment. The effects of weight on Vp/F were fixed to the same as for Vc/F.  
In vitro data showed that eltrombopag is highly bound to human plasma proteins (> 99.9 %), 
predominantly to albumin.

•  Elimination 
In a human radiolabel study (Study TRA102861), 75 mg eltrombopag were administered by single 
dose. Eltrombopag accounted for approximately 64% of plasma radiocarbon AUC0-t suggesting the 
presence of metabolites. On average, 59% of the dose was recovered in faeces, 20% as unchanged 
eltrombopag and 21% as three co-eluting metabolites including a glutathione, glutamyl-cysteine, and 
cysteine  adduct.  On  average,  31%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  in  urine,  none  as  unchanged 
eltrombopag,  and  20%  as  a  glucuronide  of  the  phenylpyrazole  moiety  resulting  from  hydrazine 
cleavage. Hydrazine cleavage products identified in human urine suggested that eltrombopag might 
be  metabolized  by  bacteria  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  The  remaining  unaccounted  dose  in  the 
excreta was comprised of multiple metabolites that could not be identified because their levels were 
close to or below background radioactivity (19% of dose overall, 8% in faeces and 11% in urine), 
and losses incurred during sample processing and analysis (10% of dose in faeces). 
Plasma eltrombopag half-life in humans following a single oral administration ranged from 21 to 32 
hours.  Data  from  the  mass  balance  study  show  that  the  mean  total  recovery  of  radioactivity  was 
89.6%  (range  of  83.8  to  93.2%)  of  the  dose.  Faecal  elimination  was  the  predominant  route  of 
elimination with a  mean  of 58.9% (range of 40.9 to 69.8%) of the total radiocarbon dose. Urinary 
excretion  accounted  for  a  mean  recovery  of  30.7%  (range  of  23.4  to  45.4%)  of  the  administered 
dose.  Urinary  elimination  was  essentially  complete  in  the  first  48  hours  post dose  while  faecal 
elimination  continued  for  several  more  days.    Most  of  the  dose  was  recovered  by  144 hours  after 
dosing. 
The  in  vivo  metabolism  of  eltrombopag  was  investigated  in  six  healthy  male  subjects  (CD 
2006/01628/00)  following  a  single  oral  administration  of  [14C]eltrombopag  at  dose  of  75  mg. 
Eltrombopag  was  the  predominant  radiocomponent  in  plasma  extracts.  Minor  metabolites,  each 
accounting  for  approximate  10%  or  less  of  plasma  radioactivity  were  also  detected  and  were 
products  of  glucuronidation  or  oxidation.  Parent  eltrombopag  was  not  detected  in  urine.  The 
predominant radiometabolite present in the human urine (accounting for about 20% of the dose) was 
a glucuronide of the phenylpyrazole moiety (lower portion) of the molecule following the cleavage 
of  the  hydrazine  linkage.  NMR  analysis  confirmed  that  a  glucuronide  conjugate  of  the  biphenyl 
moiety (unlabelled top portion after cleavage) of eltrombopag was also present in urine. In faeces, 
unchanged  eltrombopag  and  three  co-eluting  glutathione-related  conjugates  were  the  predominant 
radio-components. Eltrombopag accounted for approximately 20% of the administered dose and the 
co-eluting  metabolites  (a  glutathione,  a  glutamyl-cysteine,  and  a  cysteine  adduct  of  eltrombopag) 
together accounted for approximately 21% of the dose. 
Based on the  metabolic profile characterized in the human  mass balance study, it is estimated that 
approximately  21%  of  a  dose  could  be  metabolised  through  the  CYP  system  and  CYP1A2  and 
CYP2C8  were  identified  in  vitro  as  enzymes  responsible  for  the  oxidative  metabolism  of 
for 
eltrombopag.  UGT1A1  and  UGT1A3  were 
glucuronidation. Eltrombopag, administered as 75 mg QD for 7 days, did not inhibit or induce the 
metabolism  of  probe  substrates  for  CYP  1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  and  3A4  in  healthy  male  subjects.  In 
addition, there has been no evidence for the formation of any human specific metabolites. 
the  enzymes 
identified  as 
responsible 
Eltrombopag  is  not  a  substrate  or  inhibitor  of  P-glycoprotein.  Eltrombopag  is  not  a  substrate  for 
OATP1B1, but is an inhibitor of this transporter with an IC50 value of 2.7μg/mL). Eltrombopag is a 
substrate and inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP with an IC50 value of 2.7 μg/mL), 
and  has  been  shown  to  increase  plasma  concentrations  of  the  OATP1B1  and  BCRP  substrate 
rosuvastatin (Study TRA105120). 
Elimination was well characterized in the final population PK model by assuming a 2-compartment 
PK model with first order absorption and first order elimination. The final covariate model included 
the influence of body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F, and Vp/F, and influence of the disease (ITP versus 
healthy), race, gender, and concomitant corticosteroids on CL/F. Mean (95% CI) apparent clearance 
was 33% (26%, 41%) lower in Asians compared to all other races, 26% (7%, 45%) lower in patients 
24/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
taking  corticosteroids  concomitantly,  and  19%  (7%,  31%)  lower  in  females  compared  to  males. 
Healthy subjects had 17% (0%, 34%) higher CL/F than ITP patients. 
Eight polymorphisms were identified as significantly associated with PK variability using the tiered 
approach  in  Asian  or  White  HVT  subjects.  None  of  these  polymorphisms  was  associated  with  PK 
variability in both Asian and White HVT samples. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following  administration  of  single  oral  doses  of  eltrombopag  as  granules  in  a  capsule,  plasma 
eltrombopag exposure increased more than proportionally with dose over the range of 3 mg to 9 mg; 
the slope (95% CI) estimate was 1.59 (1.21, 1.97) for AUC(0-t), 1.51 (1.14, 1.88) for AUC(0-∞), and 
1.68  (1.39,  1.97)  for  Cmax.  Plasma  eltrombopag  AUC  and  Cmax  increased  in  a  greater  than  dose 
proportional  manner  between  3mg  and  9mg  because  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  slope 
estimate was greater than one. 
No accumulation of plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-τ) was observed after QD dosing at 5 mg and 10 
mg; however, 37–56% accumulation was observed after QD dosing of 20 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 
mg for 10 days (49115/002). Single dose plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞) and Cmax values increased 
with  increasing  dose  in  a  slightly  greater  than  dose  proportional  manner  where  the  slope  estimate 
(90%) CI) 1.13 (1.04, 1.22) for AUC(0-∞) and 1.15 (1.07, 1.24) for Cmax over a range of 5 mg to 75 
mg.  Steady-state  plasma  eltrombopag  AUC(0-τ)  and  Cmax  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  a 
slightly  greater  than  dose  proportional  manner  where  the  slope  estimate  (90%  CI)  was  1.19  (1.11, 
1.26) for AUC(0-τ) and 1.20 (1.12, 1.27) for Cmax over a range of 5 mg to 75 mg QD. 
No time dependent changes in plasma eltrombopag pharmacokinetics were observed across the dose 
levels (49115/002). After receiving a dose of 75 mg qd of eltrombopag, AUC, Cmax and half-live 
values at the first and the tenth day were quite similar with no statistically significant differences (72 
vs.79 mg*h/L; 6 vs.7 mg/L; 16 vs.14h, respectively).  
•  Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
An  open-label,  non-randomized  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  50  mg 
eltrombopag  was  performed  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment.  Plasma 
eltrombopag AUC(0-∞) was on average 32%, 36% and 60% lower in subjects with mild, moderate 
and  severe  renal  impairment,  respectively,  compared  with  healthy  subjects.  Moderate  to  high 
between-subject  variability  (CVb%)  was  observed  in  the  PK  parameters  and  variability  increased 
with  increasing  severity  of  renal  impairment.  The  impact  on  half-life  was  not  so  evident but  CL/F 
showed a significant increase from healthy subjects to severe renal impairment subjects. 
Impaired hepatic function 
An  open-label,  non-randomized  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  50  mg 
eltrombopag  was  performed  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  volunteers  with  mild,  moderate  or  severe 
hepatic  impairment.  AUC0-∞  of  eltrombopag  was  41 %  higher  in  subjects  with  mild  hepatic 
impairment  and  80  %  to  93 %  higher  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment 
compared with healthy volunteers. 
Gender 
The influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (14 females) and 88 patients with ITP (57 females).  
Based  on  estimates  from  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  female  ITP  patients  had 
approximately  50 %  higher  plasma  eltrombopag  AUC(0-τ)  as  compared  to  male  patients,  without 
adjustment for body weight differences. 
Race 
25/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The influence of East Asian ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (31 East Asians) and 88 patients with ITP 
(18  East  Asians).  East  Asian  ITP  subjects  had  approximately  87%  higher  plasma  eltrombopag 
AUC(0-τ)  values  compared  to  non-East  Asian  ITP  subjects  who  were  predominantly  Caucasian, 
without adjustment for body weight differences. Similar differences in plasma eltrombopag PK were 
observed between East Asian and non-Asian healthy subjects. Evaluation of platelet response across 
the  ITP  studies  suggests  that  East  Asian  ITP  subjects  were  more  likely  to  achieve  platelet  counts 
>400  ,000/μL.  In  addition,  there  was  a  trend  to  a  higher  incidence  of  hepatobiliary  laboratory 
abnormalities in East Asian ITP subjects.  
Weight 
Apparent clearance and volume were influenced by body weight. For the range of weights in the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis (43 kg to 122 kg), predicted typical (for ITP male Caucasian 
patient without corticosteroids) CL/F and Vc/F and are 0.495 to 0.941 L/h and 6.49 to 12.3 L, 
respectively. 
Elderly 
The  studies  included  patients  over  a  wide  range  of  age.  The  median  (range)  age  across  the  199 
subjects  included  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  30  (18-85)  years.  Age  did  not 
influence the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag.  
Children 
No studies have been submitted. 
Weight, gender, race (Asian vs. Non-Asian) and corticosteroid use were predictors of drug exposure 
in ITP patients; following the same dosing regimen lighter subjects, women, subjects of Asian origin 
and corticosteroid users would have greater eltrombopag exposures. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
A  clinical  drug  interaction  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential  impact  of  co-
administering  eltrombopag  on  the  PK  of  rosuvastatin,  an  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitor  used  to 
reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides, and an OATP1B1 and BCRP substrate.  Eltrombopag 75 
mg  once  daily  for  5  days  with  a  single  dose  of  rosuvastatin  10  mg  increased  plasma  rosuvastatin 
Cmax 103 % (90 % CI: 82 %, 126 %) and AUC0-∞ 55 % (90 % CI: 42 %, 69 %). 
A  clinical  drug  interaction  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential  impact  of  co-
administering  eltrombopag  with  a  polyvalent  metal  cation-containing  antacid.    Administration  of  a 
single  75  mg  dose  of  eltrombopag  with  an  antacid  (1524  mg  aluminium  hydroxide  and  1425  mg 
magnesium carbonate) decreased plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞) and Cmax by 70%.  
A clinical drug interaction study was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of co-administering 
eltrombopag on  the  PK of  CYP  substrates.  Administration  of  eltrombopag  75 mg  once  daily  for 7 
days  with  single  doses  of  CYP  substrates  did  not  inhibit  or  induce  CYP1A2  (caffeine),  CYP2C9 
(flurbiprofen),  CYP2C19  (omeprazole),  or  CYP3A4  (midazolam)  as  evidenced  by  no  change  in 
probe substrate PK. 
Study  TPL  111716  in  40  healthy  volunteers  was  a  phase  I,  open-label,  single  sequence  study  was 
aimed  at  providing  information  on  the  potential  drug-drug  interaction  between  eltrombopag  and 
lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of 
LPV/RTV on plasma eltrombopag PK following administration of LPV/RTV 400/100 mg BID for 
14 days with a single dose of eltrombopag 100 mg in healthy adult subjects. In addition the impact of 
eltrombopag  on  plasma  LPV/RTV  following  administration  of  LPV/RTV  400/100  mg  BID  for  14 
days with a single dose of eltrombopag 100 mg in healthy adult subjects was evaluated. 
The results obtained show that this inhibitor of HIV protease accelerates the metabolism/elimination 
of eltrombopag, decreasing the AUC(0-∞) of eltrombopag approximately 17%, (90% CI 6.6%, 
26/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26.6%). No information was provided for eltrombopag used in a dose repeating scheme, which is the 
one used in clinical practise. 
With regard to safety, the adverse events and laboratory findings of LPV/RTV observed in the study 
are those already covered in the SPC of Kaletra, and were consistent with the safety profile of this 
medicinal product. Similarly, the adverse events observed with eltrombopag, are in line with ones 
recorded during the clinical program of the product. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
No studies have been submitted. 
•  Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Dose dependent increases in platelet counts were observed in three clinical studies following repeat 
dose administration of eltrombopag to healthy adult subjects: 
Study  497115/002-  The  mean  maximum  change  from  baseline  in  platelet  counts  were  104,000 
platelets/μL for 30 mg QD, 156,100 platelets/μL for 50 mg QD, and 163,000 platelets/μL for 75mg 
QD  after  a  10-day  repeat  dose  administration  in  26  healthy  male  subjects.  Platelet  function,  as 
measured  by  platelet  aggregation  and  activation,  was  not  affected  by  the  administration  of 
eltrombopag. 
Study TRA105580- Platelet count increases of 10,700 platelets/μL for placebo, 128,500 platelets/μL 
for  25  mg  QD,  195,000  platelets/μL  for  50  mg  QD  and  202,200  platelets/μL  for  75  mg  QD  were 
observed  after  a  10-day  repeat  dose  administration  in  42  healthy  Japanese  male  subjects.  Platelet 
counts  reached  peak  level  on  Day  14  post-dose,  and  returned  to  baseline  values  during  follow-up 
periods. 
Study TRA102860- Platelet count increases of 14, 200 platelets/μL for placebo, 67,400 platelets/μL 
for 100 mg QD, 107,300 platelets/μL for 150 mg QD, and 149,600 platelets/μL for 200 mg QD were 
observed  after  a  5-day  repeat  dose  administration  in  33  healthy  subjects  (18  males/15  females). 
Platelet  counts  reached  peak  level  on  Day  14  post-dose,  and  returned  to  baseline  values  during 
follow-up periods. 
Pharmacodynamic response was not observed following single dose administration of eltrombopag 
in the following studies: 
Study  497115/001-Following  single  oral  administration  of  3,  6,  and  9  mg  of  eltrombopag  to  24 
healthy male subjects. 
Study 497115/002- Following single oral administration of  5, 10, 20, 50 and 75 mg of eltrombopag 
to 97 healthy male subjects. 
Study TRA105580- Following single oral administration of 25, 50 and 75 mg of eltrombopag to 42 
healthy male subjects. 
Study TRA104603- Following single oral administration of 30, 50, 75 and 100 mg of eltrombopag to 
16 healthy male Japanese subjects. 
A conventional sequential PK/PD approach was used to build the population PK/PD model. The PD 
data were fitted alone using the individual maximum a posteriori Bayesian PK parameter estimates 
(obtained from the population PK model) to predict the eltrombopag concentrations. The population 
PK/PD model assumes that platelet precursor production is the same in healthy volunteers and ITP 
patients, but that platelets are degraded much faster in ITP patients (larger KP), which is consistent 
with an increased rate of platelet destruction in ITP disease well described in the literature. Despite 
the  higher  platelet  count  variability  and  fixing  KIN  and  KOUT  to  the  estimates  from  the  healthy 
volunteer model, the ITP patient PK/PD model predictions were consistent with the observed platelet 
count  versus  time  data.  The  population  PK/PD  model  was  validated  (internal  validation:  visual 
predictive check (VPC) and non-parametric bootstrap analysis) to confirm the internal robustness of 
the model. 
27/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  final  model  was  used  to  simulate  platelet  counts  for  ITP  patients  following  10  weeks  of  once 
daily dosing of 50 mg eltrombopag. The results of the simulations indicated that steady-state platelet 
counts  were  achieved  by  week  3  and  that  90%  of  steady-state  was  achieved  by  week  2.  Thus, 
biweekly  dose  adjustments  are  a  reasonable  approach  to  titrate  each  patient.  Doubling  the 
eltrombopag  dose  from  25  to  50  mg  once  daily  would  increase  median  steady-state  platelet  count 
45%, and a 50% increase in dose from 50 to 75 mg once daily would increase steady-state median 
platelet count 31%. 
In healthy subjects, baseline platelet counts, gender and race (Asian versus non-Asian) were tested as 
covariates on the parameters KIN, KOUT, and SLOP, and gender was also tested on the parameter 
BASE. Finally, the only significant covariate-parameter relationship was gender on SLOP indicating 
females  had  a  36%  lower  slope  compared  to  males.  In  the  ITP  patients  population  PK/PD  model, 
gender and age were the only covariates which could be included in the model on KIN suggesting 
that female and older ITP patients (≥65 years) appear to be more sensitive to eltrombopag than men 
and younger patients.  
In healthy subjects, concomitant drugs were not included in the final population PK/PD model since 
no significant covariate-parameter relationship was found. Concurrent and prior ITP medications of 
interest  included:  corticosteroids,  intravenous  immunoglobulins  (IVIg),  vincristine/vinblastine, 
cyclophosamide,  danazol,  rituximab,  azathioprine,  cyclosporine,  dapsone  and  mycophenolate. 
Corticosteroids  were  the  only  concomitant  ITP  medication  group  used  by  more  than  10%  of 
population. The use of concurrent corticosteroids has been identified as a predictive factor of higher 
platelet counts following administration of eltrombopag to ITP patients, either due to higher plasma 
eltrombopag exposure (PK) or greater PD response. 
According to submitted data, samples from more than 200 patients with 8 different sorts of solid and 
non-solid tumours demonstrated levels of Mpl below the levels of accurate detection by microarray 
or qRT-PCR. No single non-megakaryocytic cell line tested has demonstrated increased proliferation 
when  treated  with  eltrombopag  up  to  100  μg/mL,  and  last  submitted  data  show  low  or  non 
quantifiable levels of Mpl expression in all the different tumours tested ex-vivo. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The gene encoding for TPO-R is a proto-oncogen, also known as c-Mpl, the increased expression of 
which  has  been  linked  to  poor  prognosis  in  myelodysplastic  syndrome  and  in  acute  myeloid 
leukaemia.  According  to  the  submitted  data  the  concern  on  the  potential  stimulatory  effect  of 
eltrombopag  on  the  proliferation  of  some  malignant  cell  lines  is  minimal,  although  it  cannot  be 
completely discarded. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC reflecting this risk and 
the Applicant will study long term effects in a post-marketing study included in the risk management 
plan.  
Data of concentration over time and platelet counts used in the population PK/PD analysis are rich 
enough  and  well  distributed  across  time  to  support  the  estimation  of  the  population  PK/PD 
parameters with fairly good precision. 
Based  on  estimates  from  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  East  Asian  (i.e.  Japanese, 
Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) ITP patients had approximately 87 % higher plasma eltrombopag 
AUC(0-τ) values as compared to non-East Asian patients who were predominantly Caucasian, without 
adjustment for body weight differences. Initiation of eltrombopag at a reduced dose of 25 mg once 
daily may be considered for patients of East Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese 
or Korean) and this information has been included in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC. The Applicant 
has  committed  to  further  investigate  the  ethnic  differences  observed  in  eltrombopag  exposure  in  a 
post-authorisation commitment. 
In  order  to  avoid  clinically  significant  reductions  in  plasma  eltrombopag  exposure,  eltrombopag 
should be administered at least 4 hours apart from antacids and other products containing polyvalent 
cations  such  as  mineral  supplements  and  dairy  products.  Administration  of  eltrombopag  with  a 
standard  high-calorie,  high-fat  breakfast  that  included  dairy  products  reduced  plasma  eltrombopag 
28/79 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
AUC0-∞ by 59 % and Cmax by 65 %. This information has been included in the SPC in sections 4.2 
and 4.5. 
Platelet counts should be monitored when combining eltrombopag with other medicinal products for 
the  treatment  of  ITP  (corticosteroids,  danazol,  and/or  azathioprine,  intravenous  immunoglobulin 
(IVIG), and anti-D immunoglobulin) in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the recommended 
range (relevant information included in section 4.2 of the SPC). 
Interactions of eltrombopag and rosuvastatin have been demonstrated in healthy adults. Interactions 
are also expected with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including pravastatin, simvastatin and 
lovastatin,  however,  clinically  significant  interactions  are  not  expected  between  eltrombopag  and 
atorvastatin  or  fluvastatin.  Concomitant  administration  of  eltrombopag  and  OATP1B1  (e.g. 
methotrexate)  and  BCRP  (e.g.  topotecan  and  methotrexate)  substrates  should  also  be  undertaken 
with caution. This information has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC. 
Co-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir may cause a decrease in the concentration 
of  eltrombopag.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  used  when  co-administration  of  eltrombopag  with 
lopinavir/ritonavir  takes  place.  Platelet  count  should  be  closely  monitored  in  order  to  ensure 
appropriate  medical  management  of  the  dose  of  eltrombopag  when  lopinavir/ritonavir  therapy  is 
initiated  or  discontinued.  This  interaction  has  been  included  in  section  4.5  of  the  SPC  for 
information.  In  addition  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  provide  further  information  on  the  co-
administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir as a post-authorisation commitment. 
The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied after administration of eltrombopag to adult 
subjects  with  hepatic  impairment.  There  was  substantial  variability  and  significant  overlap  in 
exposures between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. Unbound eltrombopag 
(active) concentration for this highly protein bound medicinal product were not measured. Therefore, 
eltrombopag should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score  ≥ 7)  unless  the  expected  benefit  outweighs  the  identified  risk  of  portal  venous  thrombosis.. 
Information  on  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  has  been  included  in  sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC. 
No  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Patients  with  impaired  renal 
function  should  use  eltrombopag  with  caution  and  close  monitoring,  for  example  by  testing  serum 
creatinine and/or performing urine analysis. This information has been included in sections 4.2 and 
5.2 of the SPC. 
Clinical efficacy  
The  primary  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  comes  from  3  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled studies (TRA100773A, TRA100773B, and RAISE, see Table 7). TRA 100773 consisted 
of two independent, sequentially conducted studies: the phase II dose-finding TRA 100773A study 
and the phase III TRA 100773B study, both with treatment periods for up to 6 weeks. RAISE was 
phase III study of 6 months treatment duration. 
Additional efficacy data from 2 single-arm, open-label studies (REPEAT and EXTEND, see Table 7) 
are ongoing. The REPEAT study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag 
following up to 3 intermittent treatment cycles of up to 6 weeks of eltrombopag administration. The 
EXTEND  study  was  designed  to  determine  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  in 
subject who has been previously participated in an eltrombopag study.

•  Dose response study 
TRA100773A Study 
The  first  part  of  study  TRA100773  (TRA100773A)  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-
controlled, parallel group study  comparing 30, 50 and 75 mg and placebo as oral tablets once-daily 
for 6 weeks to adult male and female subjects with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. This 
phase  II/III  investigated  the  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  as  short-term  therapy  (six  weeks)  for  patients 
with chronic ITP. The study was expected to determine an optimal dose (part A), whose efficacy and 
safety in the short-term treatment of patients with ITP were to be established in part B. 
Dose levels to be tested were chosen based upon the results obtained in previous PD and PK studies. 
Dose  dependent  increases  in  platelet  counts,  of  at  least  1.3-fold  above  baseline,  were  observed  in 
healthy male subjects who received 20, 30, 50 and 75mg once-daily for 10 days. In addition, there 
was an acceptable safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of up to 75mg eltrombopag once-daily 
for 10 days in healthy male subjects. 
Patients with chronic ITP that had failed at least one previous therapy were included. As an inclusion 
criterion,  a  baseline  platelet  count  below  30,000/μL  was  required.  Both  splenectomised  and  non-
splenectomised patients were allowed to enter the study. 
Stratification was done by use of ITP medication at randomization, splenectomy status and baseline 
platelet count ≤15,000/μL. The treatment phase included a daily dose of randomised medication for 
up  to  6  weeks.  Subjects  who  achieved  a  platelet  count  >200,000/μL  discontinued  treatment  with 
study medication.  Platelet counts were scheduled every week during the on-therapy period, and after 
2, 4 and 6 weeks post therapy. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of responders at day 43 (week 6 visit). Responders were 
defined  as  subjects  whose  platelet  count  reached  ≥  50,000/μL  at  the  day  43  visit  from  a  baseline 
count of <30,000/μL. Patients were also classified as responders if they achieved a platelet count of 
>200,000/μL prior to day 43. The final on-treatment value was carried forward for such patients for 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analyses.  Patients were classified as non-responders if they discontinued study 
medication  prior  to  the  day  43  visit  for  any  other  reason,  irrespective  of  their  last  on  treatment 
platelet  count.  The  baseline  score  was  carried  forward  for  these  patients  in  ITT  analyses.  The 
proportion  of  responders  was  compared  between  treatments  using  a  logistic  regression  model 
adjusted by the stratification factors used in the randomisation. 
The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  efficacy  population  (subjects  randomized  and  treated 
with  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  and  with  a  baseline  platelet  count  of  <30,000/μL). 
30/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional  supportive  analyses  were  performed  using  the  ITT  Population  (all  randomized  subjects 
who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one platelet count post-dosing) 
and the Per-Protocol (PP) Population, which excluded major protocol violators. 
Two  interim  analyses  were  scheduled.  The  first  analysis  was  to  be  done  when  on-therapy  platelet 
count  data  were  available  for  approximately  one-third  (~90)  of  subjects  and  the  second  interim 
analysis when data were available from two-thirds (~180) of the subjects. At each interim analysis, a 
dose could be stopped for either efficacy using a step-down procedure or for futility using a step-up 
procedure  or  for  safety  concerns.  The  critical  value  for  stopping  the  study  early  for  efficacy  was 
p≤0.0113  (1-sided)  for  the  first  interim  and  would  have  been  p≤0.0112  (1-sided)  for  the  second 
interim.  The  final  analysis  was  to  be  conducted  using  p≤0.0147  as  the  critical  value.  In  order  to 
protect the overall Type I error at 2.5% (1-sided), a closed testing procedure was applied.  
Patients’ baseline characteristics were properly balanced between groups (considering the relatively 
small sample size). 
The study was stopped at the first interim analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint showed that there 
was a dose-dependent effect as assessed by the rate of responders (27.6%, 70.4% and 80.8% in the 
groups of treatment 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg respectively) being the results of the  2 higher doses 
statistically significantly different from placebo (p<0.001) (see results in Table 8 and Figure 1). 
The logistic regression analysis (primary analysis defined in the protocol) showed a consistent effect 
regardless the population considered. An interaction between treatment and background therapy and 
baseline platelet count was found, especially for the 50 mg dose.

31/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  a  post-hoc  analysis  the  durability  of  the  response  was  assessed.  The  number  of  patients  who 
showed a sustained response during >4 weeks was 10%, 27% and 18 % in the groups of treatment 30 
mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg respectively. Due to the small sample size and the nature of the analysis these 
results should be interpreted with caution. 
In  conclusion,  study  TRA100773A  showed  a  dose  dependent  increase  in  the  number  of  patients 
whose  platelet  counts  increased  form  a  pre-dosing  level  of  <30,000/μL  to  >50,000/μL/  (primary 
endpoint)  over  the  six  weeks  duration  of  the  study.  This  effect  was  supported  by  the  analysis  of 
secondary  endpoints  (mean  platelet  count,  bleeding  events).  On  the  basis  of  these  results  the 
Applicant selected 50 mg/d as the starting dose for phase III studies.

screening. 
12. previous participation in a clinical study with eltrombopag. 
Treatments 
The doses for this study were eltrombopag 50mg or matching placebo once daily for up to 6 weeks. 
Subjects  with  platelet  counts  <50,000/μL  on  Day  ≥22  may  have  had  their  dose  increased  to 
eltrombopag 75mg (or matching placebo). Subjects reaching a platelet count above 200,000/μL were 
withdrawn from the study medication, but continued to attend follow-up visits. 
Subjects  were  permitted  to  use  stable,  maintenance  ITP  medications  (corticosteroids,  azathioprine, 
danazol,  cyclosporin  A  and  mycophenolate  mofetil)  during  the  treatment  period  of  the  trial.  Dose 
and duration of treatment were recorded during the on-therapy and follow-up periods. If the dose of 
concomitant maintenance ITP medication was modified, the subject was to be withdrawn from study 
medication. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of eltrombopag as a thrombopoietic 
agent,  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6  weeks  to  previously  treated  adult  subjects  with 
chronic ITP. 
Secondary objectives of the study were: 
•  To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  eltrombopag  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6 
weeks to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP; 
•  To  characterize  the  population  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  oral  eltrombopag  using  a  serial 
pharmacokinetic  sampling  strategy  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6  weeks  to  previously 
treated adult subjects with chronic ITP; 
•  To  assess  the  impact  of  eltrombopag  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  symptoms  of 
thrombocytopenia  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6  weeks  to  previously  treated  adult 
subjects with chronic ITP; and 
• To assess the impact of eltrombopag on the health-related quality of life when administered once 
daily for up to 6 weeks to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  a  shift  from  a  baseline  platelet  count  of  <30,000/μL  to 
≥50,000/μL  after  up  to  42  days  of  dosing  with  study  medication.  The  primary  analysis  of  this 
endpoint was performed on a dataset which classified subjects as either responders or non-responders 
(primary dataset). 
Criteria to determine response in the primary dataset: 
•  Subjects were classified as responders if they achieved a platelet count of ≥50,000/μL at the 
Day 43 Visit; 
•  Subjects were also classified as responders if they responded strongly with a platelet count 
>200,000/μL  and  discontinued  study  medication  prior  to  Day  43;  their  last  on  treatment 
platelet count was used to determine response; and 
•  Subjects  were  classified  as  non-responders  if  they  discontinued  treatment  with  study 
medication  prior  to  the  Day  43  Visit  for  any  other  reason,  irrespective  of  their  last  on 
treatment platelet count. 
Other secondary endpoints include: 
• Platelet counts; 
• Proportion of subjects responding to treatment during Weeks 2 to 6 of the study 
• Proportion of subjects with platelet counts ≥50,000/μL and at least twice their baseline 
• Incidence and severity of symptoms associated with chronic ITP, including bleeding, bruising, and 
petechiae, were measured using the WHO Bleeding Scale and the ITP Bleeding Score; and 
•  Physical  and  mental  health  status  using  the  Short  Form-36,  version  2  (SF-36v2)  health-related 
quality of life (HR-QoL) tool and Patient Preference Assessment.

Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  calculated  to  compare  the  differences  between  eltrombopag  50mg  versus 
placebo  in  the  proportion  of  responders  42  days  after  initiation  of  dosing  (Day  43  measurement). 
Assuming  25%  and  60%  responses  on  placebo  and  eltrombopag  50mg,  respectively,  87  evaluable 
subjects (58 on eltrombopag, 29 on placebo) were needed in order to provide 90% power at the 5% 
level  of  significance  (two-sided).  However,  in  order  to  provide  additional  safety  data,  66  subjects 
were  to  be  recruited  to  the  eltrombopag  treatment  group  and  33  subjects  to  the  placebo  treatment 
group. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized to treatment (eltrombopag 50mg or placebo) in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization 
was stratified based upon use or non-use of ITP medications at randomization, splenectomy status 
(refractory following splenectomy or non-splenectomised) and baseline platelet count (≤15,000/μL 
or >15,000/μL). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study and treatment allocation was blinded to the subjects, the site staff and 
sponsor personnel. Treatment blinding was maintained by use of matching placebo tablets. 
Statistical methods 
All programming was performed using SAS version 8, or a later release, in a UNIX environment. All 
confidence  intervals  were  calculated  at  the  95%  confidence  levels.  Any  analyses  requiring 
significance  testing  were  performed  using  a  two-sided  test  at  the  0.05  significance  level,  unless 
otherwise specified. 
The  proportion  of  responders  was  compared  between  treatments  using  a  logistic  regression  model 
adjusted for ITP medication use at randomization, splenectomy status and baseline platelet count. 
Summary statistics for the primary endpoint were presented for each stratum. Similar summaries for 
other  subgroups,  such  as  gender,  race  and  age,  were  also  provided.  The  level  of  significance  for 
interactions was set to 10%. If a significant treatment by strata interaction was seen in the primary 
endpoint, then the primary efficacy analysis table was produced for each level of the strata. Inference 
was only made for the primary and secondary endpoints above should the interaction be statistically 
significant and considered to be clinically relevant. 
There were no requirements for multiplicity adjustments in this study. The overall type I error rate is 
0.05 (two-sided).

Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 6 Feb 2006 – 31 Jan 2007. After the dosing period subjects were 
assessed at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks to assess the durability of the platelet response and safety parameters. 
Subjects were also to complete an ocular examination 6 weeks and 6 months following the final dose 
of study medication. 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  4  amendments  to  the  protocol  in  study  TRA100773,  however  only  Amendment  4 
pertained to Study TRA100773B. This amendment, dated 28 November 2005, addressed changes 
on  dose  selection  and  revised  sample  size  based  on  the  evaluation  of  interim  data  that  led  to 
termination  of  study  TRA100773A  (because  of  overwhelming  efficacy).  In  addition  it  added:  a 
secondary endpoint of “elevation of platelets to ≥50,000/μL and at least twice their baseline value”, 
an  additional  logistic  regression  analysis  of  responders  using  a  Generalized  Estimating  Equations 
(GEE) methodology, a follow-up visit at Day 50 and the ITP Bleeding Scale and Patient Preference 
assessments (as secondary efficacy endpoints). 
Six  subjects  had  one  or  more  major  protocol  violations  resulting  in  full  data  exclusion.  These 
subjects (placebo: 1 subject; eltrombopag: 5 subjects) were excluded from the PP Population. Two 
subjects  in  the  eltrombopag  treatment  group  were  excluded  due  to  evidence  that  the  subject’s 
underlying condition was not ITP and that the platelet count was ≥30,000/μL at Day 1 or within 24h 
prior to dosing on Day 1. 
Baseline data 
The summary of the demographic characteristics in the ITT Population is shown in Table 9. 
Table 9: Summary of Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population) 
Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  in  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag  groups  (50%  and  47%, 
respectively) were receiving ITP medication at randomization. Similar percentages of subjects (34% 
and  37%,  respectively)  had  a  prior  splenectomy  and  baseline  platelet  counts  of  ≤15  ,000/μL  (48% 
and 50%, respectively). 
All subjects in both treatment groups had ≥1 prior ITP therapy as determined by clinical review (see 
Table  10).  Approximately  50%  of  subjects  had  received  at  least  3  prior  treatments.  A  higher 
percentage of subjects in the eltrombopag treatment arm had ≥3 and ≥4 prior therapies compared to 
37/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo.  Prior  ITP  medications  used  by  subjects  were  similar  across  the  2  treatment  groups. 
Corticosteroids were the most commonly reported prior ITP medication taken by approximately 75% 
of subjects in both treatment groups. 
Table 10: Number of Prior ITP Therapies by Subject (Safety Population) 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 114 subjects were enrolled in the study, with 76 randomized to the eltrombopag treatment 
group, and 38 randomized to placebo. 
The  Efficacy  Population  was  the  primary  population  for  efficacy  analyses.  Additional  supportive 
analyses  were  performed  using  the  ITT  and  the  PP  Populations,  which  excluded  major  protocol 
violators. All safety analyses were reported using the Safety Population. The numbers of subjects in 
each population are presented in Table 11. 
Table 11. Populations analysed. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Responders at day 43 visit. 
The  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  showed  that  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  platelet  counts 
≥50,000/μL after up to 6 weeks of dosing was greater in the eltrombopag treated group compared to 
placebo. A total of 59% of subjects on eltrombopag attained a platelet count of ≥50,000/μL on Day 
43, compared to 16% of subjects on placebo (Efficacy Population). The odds ratio for active/placebo 
treatment  was  9.61  (95%  CI  3.31-27.86)  showing  a  statistically  significant  p-value  (two-sided) 
<0.001. 
At each visit, the percentage of responders was greater in the eltrombopag treatment group compared 
to  the  placebo  treatment  group  (see  Figure  2).  Other  thresholds  included:  Platelets  >200,000/μL, 
placebo 1/37 (3%) vs. eltrombopag 18/73 (25%); and Platelets >400,000/μL, placebo 0/371 (0%) vs. 
eltrombopag 2/73 (3%).

This  effect  of  eltrombopag  relative  to  placebo  was  significant  across  all  subgroups  regardless  of 
baseline  platelet  count,  use  of  concomitant  ITP  medication  or  splenectomy  status  (see  Table  12). 
This difference was observed in all study visits.

A total of 35 out of 76 patients in the eltrombopag group were uptitrated to 75 mg after day 22, of 
whom 31% (11/35) were responders after having their doses increased (see Table 13).  
Table 13. Summary of Number of Subjects Requiring a Dose Increase at Day 22 or Subsequent Visit 
Analysis of responders at Day 43 for the PP Population also showed a statistically significant 
treatment effect for the eltrombopag treatment group (Odds ratio= 8.51 p<0.001), confirming the 
results obtained with the Efficacy Population.

Secondary efficacy results 
-  Platelet counts 
Median platelet counts at nominal visits with 25th and 75th percentiles throughout the course of the 
trial are shown in Figure 3. 
Figure  3:  Median  Platelet  Counts  (Gi/L)  with  25th  and  75th  percentiles  (Efficacy  Population, 
Observed Dataset) 
- Bleeding 
Consistently  with  the  increase  in  platelet  count,  an  effect  on  bleeding  rates  was  observed.  A 
statistically  significant  decrease  in  any  bleeding  (WHO  grades  1  to  4)  at  day  43  was  observed  in 
secondary  analyses  in  subjects  treated  eltrombopag  compared  to  placebo  (OR=0.27,  p=0.029)  (see 
Table 14).

Secondary analyses based on updated results showed similar trend with 25/38 (66%) bleedings in 
placebo  treated  subjects  compared  to  30/76  (39%)  in  eltrombopag  treated  subjects  (ITT 
population,  WHO  bleedings  grade  1-4  at  Day  43).  The  odds  of  bleeding  were  observed  to 
remain significantly lower (p=0.010) in the eltrombopag treated group with an Odds Ratio (95% 
CI) of 0.30 (0.12, 0.75). Moreover, 11/38 (29%) of placebo treated subjects compared to 12/76 
(16%) of the eltrombopag treated subjects had a WHO bleeding grade 2-4 at Day 43. The odds 
of bleeding was lower in the eltrombopag treated group with an Odds Ratio (95% CI) of 0.46 
(0.18, 1.19) and p=0.111  
In  the  group  of  patients  treated  with  75  mg  a  similar  percentage  of  subjects  with  WHO  bleeding 
scales grades 1 to 4 in placebo (86%) and eltrombopag (83%) group were observed.

In  the  eltrombopag  arm,  baseline  WHO  bleeding  scale  score  grades  0  (43.7%),  grades  1  (35.2%), 
grades  2  (16.9%)  and  grades  3  (4.2%)  changed  to  grades  0  (60.8%),  grades  1  (29.4%)  grades  2 
(9.8%)  in week 6 on treatment, showing that changes mostly affected the lowest grades (0 through 
1) and largely by a transition from "petechaie" (grade1) to the absence of petechaie (grade 0). 
- Odds of Responding to Treatment during Weeks 2-6 
At any point during the 6 week treatment period, subjects in the eltrombopag treatment group had a 
greater odd of responding than subjects in the placebo treatment group (OR=8.79; CI=3.54, 21.86; 
p<0.001) 
- Response in Platelet Count to 50,000/μL or More and at Least 2x Baseline 
Logistic regression analysis of the percentage of subjects with a Day 43 platelet count ≥50,000/μL 
and at least 2x baseline using the primary dataset for the Efficacy Population showed a statistically 
significant treatment effect of eltrombopag compared to placebo (p<0.001).  
Study TRA102537 (RAISE) 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of eltrombopag olamine, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, administered for 6 months as 
oral tablets once daily in adult subjects with previously treated chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (ITP). 
METHODS 
Study Participants  
Study  sites  were  located  in  a  total  of  23  countries  from  the  following  continents/countries:  North 
America (16 Sites), South America (2 Sites), Europe (44 Sites), Africa (1 Site), Asia (8 Sites), and 
New Zealand (4 Sites). 
Inclusion criteria 
A subject was eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria applied: 
1. Subject signed and dated a written informed consent. 
2.  Adults  (≥18  years)  diagnosed  with  chronic  ITP  according  to  the  ASH/BCSH  guidelines,  and 
platelet  count  <30,000/μL  on  Day  1  (or  within  24  hours  prior  to  dosing  on  Day  1).  In  addition,  a 
peripheral  blood  smear  should  support  the  diagnosis  of  ITP  with  no  evidence  of  other  causes  of 
thrombocytopenia  (e.g.  pseudothrombocytopenia,  myelofibrosis).  The  physical  examination  should 
not suggest any disease which may cause thrombocytopenia other than ITP. 
3.  Subjects  who  previously  received  one  or  more  prior  ITP  therapies.  Previous  treatments  for  ITP 
included  but  were  not  limited  to  corticosteroids,  immunoglobulins,  azathioprine,  danazol, 
cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab. 
4. Subjects must have had either initially responded (platelet count >100,000/μL) to a previous ITP 
therapy  or  have  had  a  bone  marrow  examination  consistent  with  ITP  within  3  years  to  rule  out 
myelodysplastic syndromes or other causes of thrombocytopenia. 
5. Previous therapy for ITP with immunoglobulins (IVIg and anti-D) must have been completed at 
least 1 week prior to randomization and the platelet count must show a clear downward trend after 
the  last  treatment  with  immunoglobulins.  Previous  treatment  for  ITP  with  splenectomy,  rituximab 
and cyclophosphamide must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, or clearly 
be ineffective. 
6. Subjects treated with concomitant ITP medication (e.g. corticosteroids or azathioprine) must have 
been  receiving  a  dose  that  was  stable  for  at  least  4  weeks  prior  to  randomization.  Subjects  treated 
with  cyclosporine  A,  mycophenolate  mofetil  or  danazol  must  have  been  receiving  a  dose  that  was 
stable for at least 3 months prior to randomization. The medication should have been continued with 
a stable dose for the initial 6 weeks of study. 
41/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  Prothrombin  time/International  Normalized  Ratio  (PT/INR)  and  activated  partial  thromboplastin 
time  (aPTT)  must  have  been  within  80  to  120%  of  the  normal  range  with  no  history  of 
hypercoagulable state. 
8. A complete blood count (CBC), within the reference range (including white blood count (WBC) 
differential not indicative of a disorder other than ITP), with the following exceptions: 
• <30,000/μL on Day 1 (or within 24 hours of Day 1) was required for inclusion, 
•  Hemoglobin: Subjects with hemoglobin levels between 10 g/dL (100 g/L) and the lower limit of 
normal were eligible for inclusion, if anaemia was clearly attributable to ITP (excessive blood loss). 
•  Absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  ≥1500/μL  (1.5  x  109/L)  was  required  for  inclusion  (elevated 
WBC/ANC due to corticosteroid treatment is acceptable). 
9.  The  following  clinical  chemistries  must  not  have  exceeded  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN) 
reference  range  by  more  than  20%:  creatinine,  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. In addition, total albumin must not 
have been below the lower limit of normal (LLN) by more than 10%. 
10.  Subject  was  practicing  an  acceptable  method  of  contraception  (documented  in  chart).  Female 
subjects  (or  female  partners  of  male  subjects)  must  have  either  been  of  non  childbearing  potential 
(hysterectomy,  bilateral  oopherectomy,  bilateral  tubal  ligation  or  post-menopausal  >1  year),  or  of 
childbearing potential and using one of the following highly effective methods of contraception (i.e., 
Pearl  Index  <1.0%)  from  two  weeks  prior  to  administration  of  study  medication,  throughout  the 
study, and 28 days after completion or premature discontinuation from the study: 
• Complete abstinence from intercourse; 
• Intrauterine device; 
•  Two  forms  of  barrier  contraception  (diaphragm  plus  spermicide,  and  for  males  condom  plus 
spermicide); 
• Male partner was sterile prior to entry into the study and is the only partner of the female; 
• Systemic contraceptives (combined or progesterone only). 
11.  Subject  was  able  to  understand  and  comply  with  protocol  requirements  and  instructions  and 
intended to complete the study as planned. 
Exclusion criteria 
A subject was not eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria applied: 
1.  Any  clinically  relevant  abnormality,  other  than  ITP,  identified  on  the  screening  examination  or 
any  other  medical  condition  or  circumstance,  which  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  made  the 
subject  unsuitable  for  participation  in  the  study  or  suggested  another  primary  diagnosis  (e.g., 
thrombocytopenia secondary to another disease). 
2.  Concurrent  malignant  disease  and/or  history  of  cancer  treatment  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy. 
3. Any prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis (stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial 
infarction,  deep  vein  thrombosis  or  pulmonary  embolism),  AND  ≥  2  of  the  following  risk  factors: 
hormone  replacement  therapy,  systemic  contraception  (containing  estrogen),  smoking,  diabetes, 
hypercholesterolemia, medication for hypertension, cancer, hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g., 
Factor V Leiden, antithrombin III deficiency, etc), or any other family history of arterial or venous 
thrombosis. 
4. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Grade 
III/IV), or arrhythmia known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), 
or subjects with a QTc >450 msec. 
5.  Female  subjects  who  were  nursing  or  pregnant  (positive  serum  or  urine  β-human  chorionic 
gonadotrophin pregnancy test) at screening or pre-dose on Day 1. 
6. History of alcohol/drug abuse. 
7. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever was longer) 
preceding the first dose of study medication. 
8.  Subject  treated  with  drugs  that  affect  platelet  function  (including  but  not  limited  to  aspirin, 
clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs) or anti-coagulants for > 3 consecutive days within 2 weeks of the study 
start and until the end of the study. 
9. History of platelet agglutination abnormality that prevents reliable measurement of platelet counts. 
10.  All  subjects  with  secondary  immune  thrombocytopenia,  including  those  with  laboratory  or 
clinical  evidence  of  HIV  infection,  anti-phospholipid  antibody  syndrome,  chronic  hepatitis  B 
42/79 
 
infection,  hepatitis  C  virus  infection,  or  any  evidence  for  active  hepatitis  at  the  time  of  subject 
screening. If a potential subject had no clinical history that would support HIV infection or hepatitis 
infection, no further laboratory screening was necessary; however, standard medical practice would 
suggest further evaluation of subjects who had risk factors for these infections. 
11. Previous participation in a clinical study with eltrombopag. 
12. Subjects planning to have cataract surgery. 
13. In France, a subject was neither affiliated with nor a beneficiary of a social security category. 
Treatments 
The  starting  dose  was  either  eltrombopag  50  mg  or  matching  placebo  once  daily.  Throughout  the  six 
month treatment period, the dose of the study medication could be up- (75 mg/d) or down- (25 mg/d 
titrated according to platelet count monitoring). Subjects were allowed a dose increase on or after day 
22  if  a  subject’s  platelet  count  did  not  rise  above  50,000/μL  for  two  successive  platelet  count 
assessments. The subjects were to reduce their dose of eltrombopag when platelet count exceeded of 
200,000 /μL. When platelet counts reached 400,000/μL study medication was interrupted for at least 7 
days, until platelet counts fell below 150,000/μL. At that point subjects were re-administrated at next 
lower dose. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To determine the efficacy of eltrombopag as a thrombopoietic agent, when administered once daily 
for 6 months (RAISE) to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP. 
Secondary objectives 
Secondary objectives of the study were: 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered once daily for 6 months to 
previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP; 
•  To  assess  the  impact  of  eltrombopag  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  symptoms  of 
thrombocytopenia when administered once daily for  6  months to previously treated adult subjects 
with chronic ITP; 
• To assess the impact of eltrombopag on the health-related quality of life when administered once 
daily for  6 months to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP; 
• To assess the ability of eltrombopag to prevent the use of rescue treatment (rescue treatment was 
defined as a composite of: new ITP medication, increased dose of concomitant ITP medication from 
baseline, platelet transfusion and splenectomy); 
•  To  describe  the  pharmacodynamics  and  durability  of  eltrombopag  response  (maintenance  of  an 
elevated blood platelet count); 
• To determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag, when administered once daily, for 6 weeks duration, 
to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP; 
• To describe the effect of eltrombopag on reduction of concomitant ITP medications from baseline. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  odds  of  achieving  a  platelet  count  ≥50,000/μL  and  ≤400,000/μL 
during the 6-month treatment period, for subjects receiving eltrombopag relative to placebo. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
• Proportion of subjects receiving a rescue treatment (rescue treatment was defined as a composite 
of:  new  ITP  medication,  increased  dose  of  a  concomitant  ITP  medication  from  baseline,  platelet 
transfusion, and/or splenectomy) during the 6 month duration of the study. 
•  Proportion  of  subjects  for  whom  at  least  75%  of  their  assessments  were  ≥50,000/μL  and 
≤400,000/μL. 
• Maximum duration of response (≥50,000/μL and ≤400,000/μL) for each subject. 
• Proportion of subjects achieving a platelet count of ≥50,000/μL and ≤400,000/μL during weeks 2-6 
of study treatment. 
• Proportion of subjects with a reduction in use of concomitant ITP medications from baseline. 
43/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Incidence and severity of symptoms associated with chronic ITP, including bleeding, bruising, and 
petechiae, were measured using the WHO Bleeding Scale and the ITP Bleeding Score; and 
•  Physical  and  mental  health  status  using  the  Short  Form-36,  version  2  (SF-36v2)  health-related 
quality of life (HR-QoL) tool and Patient Preference Assessment. 
Sample size 
The primary analysis was to compare the odds of achieving a platelet count  ≥50 and ≤400,000/μL 
during the treatment period in the eltrombopag group relative to the placebo group. Assuming 60% 
and 25% positive response rates in the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively, 120 evaluable 
subjects were needed to provide ≥90% power at the 1% (two-sided) level of significance. To ensure 
sufficient power for both the primary and main secondary endpoints, a 30% increase in subjects was 
pre-specified to compensate for potential missing data and drop-outs during the full 6 month study 
duration, for a total of 189 subjects (63 placebo subjects; 126 eltrombopag subjects). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized 2:1, eltrombopag to placebo, and were stratified based upon 
splenectomy status, baseline use or non-use of ITP medication and baseline platelet count 
≤15,000/μL or greater than 15,000/μL. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  was  double-blinded.  Treatments  were  blinded  to  the  research  subjects  and  all  study  and 
sponsor personnel. Treatment blind was maintained by use of matching placebo medication. 
Statistical methods 
The  subject  response  profiles  during  the  6-month  treatment  period  were  compared  between 
treatments  using  a  repeated  measures  model  for  binary  data  adjusted  for  the  randomization 
stratification variables. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) methodology was used to estimate 
the  regression  model  parameters  with  the  correlation  of  an  individual  subject’s  responder  status 
between  visits  being  modelled  as  exchangeable  (i.e.  assuming  the  correlation  between  any  2 
measures for a subject is the same). 
All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 8 or a later release, in 
a  UNIX  environment.  Significance  testing  was  two-sided  at  the  1%  level  of  significance  for  the 
primary endpoint, and unless stated otherwise, significance testing was two-sided at the 5% level of 
significance  for  all  other  comparisons.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  95%  confidence  intervals  (CI) 
around the odds ratios or treatment differences, as appropriate were presented. 
There were no requirements for multiplicity adjustments in this study. The overall Type I error rate 
was  0.01  (two-sided)  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  and,  unless  otherwise  indicated,  0.05  (two-
sided) for all secondary and exploratory analyses. 
Populations for main analysis: 
Intent-to-Treat  Population:  The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  was  the  primary  population  for 
analysis and was comprised of all randomized subjects. 
Per-Protocol Population: The per-protocol (PP) population was defined as per the Intent-to-Treat 
population but excluded major protocol violators. Additional analysis based on this population was 
performed for the primary efficacy endpoint and the main secondary endpoints only. 
Safety  Population:  The  safety  population  was  comprised  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  had 
received at least one dose of the study treatment. All safety parameters were reported using the safety 
population, all subjects being analyzed under the treatment group to which they were randomized.

Recruitment 
The  study  period  was  22  November  2006  –  10  June  2008.  As  of  27  February  2008,  all  subjects 
completed the on therapy and 4-week follow-up visits of the off-therapy period. All data, including 
data obtained at the 3- and 6-month post-therapy visits, are reported through 10 June 2008, the date 
of database freeze and unblinding of treatment codes. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 4 amendments to the protocol. For each amendment, key revisions impacting the study 
are summarized below. 
Amendment 01 and 02 –country specific amendments for France to modify lifestyle and/or dietary 
restrictions  wording  to  meet  agency  restrictions  for  more  stringent  eye  and  skin  protection 
precautions. 
Amendment  03  -  included  modification  of  eligibility  criteria  to  add  clarity  based  on  regulatory 
feedback  and  the  addition  of  liver  chemistry  stopping  criteria,  platelet  count  assessments  after 
treatment  interruption,  modification  of  lifestyle  wording  concerning  precautions  to  direct  sunlight 
and/or UV exposure for all sites, and a revision to the prohibited medications. 
Amendment  04  –included  additions  of  enhanced  monitoring  for  the  potential  presence  of  renal 
toxicity and incorporated study population regulatory requirements for Tunisian subjects. 
Baseline data 
The summary of the demographic characteristics in the ITT Population is shown in Table 15. 
Table 15: Summary of Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population) 
Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  in  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag  groups  (50%  and  47%, 
respectively) were receiving ITP medication at randomization. Similar percentages of subjects (34% 
and 37%, respectively) had a prior splenectomy and baseline platelet counts of ≤15,000/μL (48% and 
50%,  respectively).  All  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  ≥1  prior  ITP  therapy  (including 
splenectomy) as determined by clinical review (see Table 16). Eighty-one percent of placebo-treated 
subjects and 78% of eltrombopag-treated subjects received at least 2 prior therapies, and more than 
30% of subjects in each group received ≥4 prior therapies.

Table 16. Number of Prior ITP Therapies by Subject (Safety Population) 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 197 subjects were enrolled in the study, with 135 subjects randomized to the eltrombopag 
treatment group, and 62 subjects randomized to placebo. 
The numbers of subjects in each population are presented in Table 17. 
Table 17: Subject Disposition. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
The  effect  of  eltrombopag  on  platelet  is  shown  in  Table  18.  The  odds  of  responding  over  the  6 
months  treatment  period  were  greater  and  significantly  different  between  eltrombopag-treated 
subjects  and  placebo-treated  subjects  (p<0.001).  Fifty-four  percent  of  the  eltrombopag-treated 
patients  and  13 %  of  placebo-treated  patients  achieved  this  level  of  response  after  6  weeks  of 
treatment. A similar platelet response was maintained throughout the study, with 52 % and 16 % of 
patients  responding  at  the  end  of  the  6-month  treatment  period.  This  response  was  observed 
regardless of splenectomy status, baseline platelet count and use of baseline ITP medications. 
Table  18.  Analysis  of  Responders–Primary  Dataset  Generalized  Estimating  Equations  (ITT 
Population) 
A sensitivity analysis using the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was consistent with these 
results. 
The table below (Table 19) presents the number and percentage of evaluable subjects who achieved a 
platelet response between 50-400,000/μL at each nominal on-therapy visit.

Platelet count 
The median platelet counts for eltrombopag treated subjects began to rise after 1 week of treatment 
and  remained  above  50,000/μL  throughout  the  6  month  treatment  period.  Two  weeks  after 
discontinuation of eltrombopag median platelet counts returned to near baseline levels (see Figure 4).  
Figure 4: Median Platelet Counts (25th and 75th percentiles) By Baseline Platelet Count – Baseline 
to 4-week Follow-up (ITT Population) 
The percentage of subjects treated with eltrombopag by dose at each nominal visit was studied. All 
subjects  initiated  treatment  with  eltrombopag  50  mg.  Beginning  as  early  as  Day  8,  a  subset  of 
subjects  who  were  sensitive  to  treatment  (achieved  platelet  counts  above  200,000/μL)  with 
eltrombopag  50  mg  were  down-titrated  to  25  mg  or  less;  approximately  20%  of  subjects  were 
maintained on ≤25 mg throughout the study. The majority of eltrombopag treated subjects received 
50 mg from Day 8 through Day 15 (99% and 93% respectively). After the Day 22 visit, subjects who 
did not achieve platelet counts above 50,000/μL on 50 mg were able to be uptitrated to eltrombopag 
75  mg.  From  Day  29  to  the  end  of  treatment,  29  to  53%  of  eltrombopag  treated  subjects  were 
48/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receiving  75  mg.  Response  to  eltrombopag  75  mg  was  observed  after  1  week  in  over  15%  of 
subjects and in between 30-46% of subjects throughout the remainder of the 6 month study. 
Duration of response 
Duration of response was assessed using data from all visits for both the continuous and cumulative 
number  of  weeks  of  response.  Summary  statistics  of  both  the  maximum  weeks  of  continuous 
response  (platelet  counts  between  50  and  400,000/μL)  and  the  cumulative  weeks  of  response  are 
provided in Table 20: 
Table 20: Maximum and Total Weeks of Platelet Response (ITT Population) 
Additional analyses assessing the durability of the response and further evaluations in the subset of 
subjects  who  attained  an  initial  platelet  rise  following  treatment  with  eltrombopag  (for  all 
subjects who had at least one assessment), are shown in Table 21:

Reduction in Use of Baseline ITP Medication 
At  baseline,  31  placebo  subjects  (50%)  and  63  eltrombopag  subjects  (47%)  reported  use  of  ITP 
medications, of which 10 (32%) and 37 (59%) subjects, respectively, reduced or discontinued at least 
one  concomitant  ITP  medication  (see  Table  21).  This  difference  was  statistically  significant 
(p=0.016).

Therapy (ITT Population)

Rescue treatment 
Rescue  treatment  was  defined  as  a  composite  of:  new  ITP  medication,  increased  dose  of  a 
concomitant ITP medication, platelet transfusion, and/or splenectomy. During the on-therapy period, 
25/62  subjects  (40%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  24/135  subjects  (18%)  in  the  eltrombopag  group 
required the use of protocol-defined rescue treatment. 
An analysis of the proportion of subjects initiating rescue treatment showed the odds of initiating a 
rescue  treatment  were  67%  lower  in  the  eltrombopag  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group 
(p=0.001). 
Bleedings 
Secondary  analyses  showed  that  the  observed  baseline  percentage  of  subjects  with  any  bleeding 
(Grades  1-4)  and  clinically  significant  bleeding  (Grades  2-4)  was  reduced  by  approximately  50 % 
from Day 15 to the end of treatment throughout the 6 month treatment period. Bleedings (Grades 1-
4)  were  reported  in  79%  of  the  patients  receiving  eltrombopag  versus  93%  receiving  placebo. 
Bleedings  (Grades  2-4)  were  reported  in  33%  of  the  patients  receiving  eltrombopag  versus  53% 
receiving  placebo.  At  each  time  point  in  both  treatment  groups,  more  than  half  of  the  bleeding 
observed  was  Grade  1  bleeding.  Throughout  the  treatment  period,  clinically  significant  bleeding 
occurred infrequently, generally in <25% of subjects in the placebo group and in <15% of subjects in 
the eltrombopag group. At baseline, more than 70 % of patients in each treatment group reported any 
bleeding  (WHO  Grades  1-4)  and  more    than  20 %  reported  clinically  significant  bleeding  (WHO 
Grades 2-4), respectively.  
Fourteen  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  (10%)  and  4  placebo-treated  subjects  (7%)  experienced  at 
least  one  haemostatic  challenge  during  the  study.  In  the  placebo  group,  2  of  the  subjects  (50%) 
required  rescue  therapy  despite  the  relatively  mild  nature  of  the  haemostatic  challenges  (tooth 
extraction and dental preventative procedure). No bleeding events were reported in conjunction with 
the  haemostatic  challenges.  In  the  eltrombopag  group,  4  of  the  14  subjects  (29%)  received  rescue 
therapy. Of the 4 subjects, 3 had not consistently responded to eltrombopag treatment (Subjects 406, 
407, and 589) and had platelet counts below 40,000/μL at the time of the haemostatic challenge. 
•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No studies have been submitted. 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
There were numerically more responders at each nominal visit amongst females compared to males 
in  both  treatment  groups;  however,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  response  to  eltrombopag 
relative to placebo between males and females (p=0.225). 
At all on therapy visits, except the Week 26 Visit, there was a higher percentage of Asian subjects 
who responded to eltrombopag compared to other racial groups. 
Subjects were prospectively categorized in the following age groups: 18-49 years, 50-64 years, 65-74 
years,  and  ≥75  years.  However,  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  in  the  ≥75 year  age  group  (2 
placebo  and  11  eltrombopag,  the  following  categories  were  defined  post-hoc  to  assess  any 
differences in the response to eltrombopag relative to placebo across age categories: 18-49 years, 50-
64  years,  and  ≥65  years).  This  analysis  indicated  no  evidence  of  a  difference  in  response  to 
eltrombopag relative to placebo between the age categories (p=0.342). 
•  Supportive studies 
REPEAT  (Repeated  ExPosure  to  Eltrombopag  in  Adults  with  Idiopathic  Thrombocytopenic 
Purpura) 
50/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is an open-label repeat dosing study of eltrombopag in adult subjects, with chronic idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP).  This  multi-centre,  open-label,  single-group,  repeat-dose,  Phase  II 
study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  eltrombopag,  initially 
administered as 50 mg oral tablets once daily, over 3 cycles of repeated, intermittent dosing. Other 
objectives were: 
• To assess the number of subjects requiring rescue treatments over 3 cycles of therapy. 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered over 3 cycles of therapy. 
• To assess anti-platelet antibody levels during the 3 cycles of eltrombopag treatment. 
•  To  assess  the  impact  of  eltrombopag  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  bleeding  symptoms  as 
measured by the World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale and ITP Bleeding Score over 3 
cycles of therapy. 
A  cycle  was  defined  as  an  eltrombopag  on-therapy  period  of  up  to  6  weeks  followed  by  an  off-
therapy period of up to 4 weeks. The duration of both the on-therapy and the off-therapy period was 
defined by the subject’s platelet count. Subjects interrupted treatment for the cycle if they achieved a 
platelet count >200,000/μL, or when they reached Week 6. Subjects began the next cycle when their 
platelet counts fell below 20,000/μL, or when they reached Week 4 of the off-therapy period and had 
platelet counts <50,000/μL. Subjects who did not respond in Cycle 1 (response defined as a platelet 
count ≥50,000/μL and at least 2x baseline at Day 43 or at treatment discontinuation due to platelet 
counts >200,000/μL) were not eligible to continue into Cycle 2 or 3. If a subject’s platelet count did 
not fall below 50,000/μL by Week 4 of therapy period, the subject did not begin the next cycle of 
treatment, but a medical monitor was contacted to discuss the subject’s case and continuation in the 
study. 
As  off-therapy  periods  were  necessary  to  examine  eltrombopag  re-treatment,  it  was  important  to 
minimize the bleeding risk patients might be exposed to by participation in the study. Therefore, in 
contrast  to  other  eltrombopag  studies,  a  higher  baseline  platelet  count  (between  ≥20,000/μL  and 
≤50,000/μL) was required for entry into this trial and eltrombopag re-treatment began after 4 weeks 
off-therapy in the previous dosing cycle, or when subject’s platelet counts fell below 20,000/μL. 
The study dosage regimen was similar to the Phase III Study TRA100773B. Subjects whose platelet 
count was below 50,000/μL for 2 successive weeks could have their eltrombopag dose increased to 
75 mg on or after Day 22 of the on-therapy period of each cycle. Subjects who had a dose adjustment 
began the next cycle at the same dose of eltrombopag they were receiving upon completion of the 
previous cycle. 
A total of 66 subjects entered the study. Sixty-six subjects entered Cycle 1, 55 subjects entered Cycle 
2  and  51  subjects  entered  Cycle  3.  Eleven  subjects  did  not  enter  Cycle  2  because  8  were  non-
responders  in  Cycle  1,  1  subject  had  a  prolonged  response,  1  subject  relocated,  and  1  subject 
withdrew due to an AE. Four additional subjects did not enter Cycle 3 because 3 of these were non-
responders in Cycle 2, and 1 subject had a prolonged response for >8 weeks after Cycle 2 and was 
withdrawn from study treatment.

The duration of response was evaluated by assessment  of responder status over time in each cycle 
(see Table 26). 
Table  26.  Durability  of  Platelet  Response  to  Eltrombopag  During  the  On-therapy  Period  (Subjects 
who Responded in Cycle 1) (ITT Population) 
Eight  subjects  experienced  10  haemostatic  challenges  during  the  study.  The  diagnostic  procedures 
and  surgeries  performed  varied  in  the  degree  of  bleeding  risk  associated  with  the  procedure,  from 
cardiac  catheterization  and  transurethral  resection  of  the  prostate  to  tooth  extraction  and  dental 
cleaning.  All  subjects  responded  to  eltrombopag  and  none  required  additional  treatment  to  elevate 
their platelet count before or after the procedure. No abnormal bleeding was reported for any of the 
procedures. 
EXTEND (Eltrombopag eXTENded Dosing Study) 
This is an extension study of eltrombopag in adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
previously  enrolled  in  eltrombopag  studies.  The  primary  objective  was  to  describe  the  long-term 
safety  and  tolerability  of  oral  eltrombopag  treatment  of  subjects  with  ITP  with  or  without 
concomitant ITP medication. 
For subjects receiving concomitant ITP medication, the study design included four stages: 
Stage 1: Eltrombopag Initial Dosing. To identify a dose of eltrombopag that increases platelet counts 
to a level high enough (≥100,000/μL) to support dose reduction of concomitant ITP medication. 
Stage  2:  Concomitant  ITP  Medication  Minimization.  To  reduce  or  eliminate  concomitant  ITP 
medication, while maintaining platelet counts ≥50,000/μL. 
Stage  3:  Eltrombopag  Dose  Adjustment.  To  identify  the  minimal  effective  dose  of  eltrombopag 
necessary  to  maintain  platelet  counts  ≥50,000/μL  in  conjunction  with  the  minimal  dose  of 
concomitant ITP medication. 
52/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Stage  4:  Eltrombopag  Long-term  Dosing.  To  monitor  safety  and  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  at  the 
minimal  effective  dose  that  in  conjunction  with  the  minimal  dose  of  concomitant  ITP  medications 
maintains platelet counts ≥50,000/μL. 
Subjects started the study receiving eltrombopag 50 mg once daily. Based upon the subjects’ platelet 
count  at  each  visit,  the  dose  of  eltrombopag  could  be  adjusted  (increased  or  decreased)  or  the 
frequency  reduced  to  less  than  once  daily,  for  example  25  mg  every  other  day.  Alternate  dosing 
schedules  to  achieve  average  daily  doses  in  between  25  mg,  50  mg  or  75  mg  were  also  allowed. 
Subjects  whose  platelet  count  exceeded  200,000/μL were  required  to  decrease  the  dosage  of  study 
medication in order to maintain platelet counts within the target range (50-400,000/μL) and to reduce 
the  possibility  of  having  platelet  counts  over  400,000/μL.  Subjects  whose  platelet  count  exceeded 
400,000/μL  were  asked  to  interrupt  study  medication  for  at  least  7  days,  until  platelet  counts  fell 
below  150,000/μL;  when  platelets  were  <150,000/μL,  subjects  were  re-administered  study 
medication at a lower dose. 
Subject disposition in the study is showed in Table 27. 
Table 27. Subject Disposition and Previous Eltrombopag Studies (All Subjects) 
The results of the study in terms of the number of subjects achieving platelet count of 50,000/μL or 
above are shown in Table 28: 
Table 28. Subjects Achieving Platelet Counts of 50,000/μL or More, 50 to 400,000/μL, and Greater 
Than 400,000/μL, by Baseline Disease Characteristics. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The superior efficacy of eltrombopag compared to placebo in terms of platelet count in ITP patients 
has  been  shown  based  on  the  pivotal  studies  submitted.  The  efficacy  database  was  robust  and 
included adequate analyses from pivotal and supportive studies.  
An association between eltrombopag and reduced bleedings has also been consistently observed in 
secondary  analyses  of  both  phase  III  studies,  though  the  effect  is  essentially  driven  by  mild  to 
moderate cutaneous bleedings. 
Eltrombopag dosing requirements must be individualised based on the patient’s platelet counts. The 
objective of treatment with eltrombopag should not be to normalise platelet counts but to maintain 
53/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
platelet  counts  above  the  level  for  haemorrhagic  risk  (> 50,000/μL).  On  the  other  hand  treatment 
with eltrombopag should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient 
to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 75 mg once daily. 
This information has been included in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
Eltrombopag is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to 
insufficient data on safety and efficacy. There are limited data on the use of eltrombopag in patients 
aged 65 years and older. In the clinical studies of eltrombopag, overall no clinically significant 
differences in safety of eltrombopag were observed between subjects aged at least 65 years and 
younger subjects. Initiation of eltrombopag at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily may be considered 
for patients of East Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese or Korean). 
Clinical safety 
The safety profile of eltrombopag has been evaluated in 26 completed or ongoing clinical studies in 
1616  eltrombopag-treated  and  247  placebo-treated  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  ITP, 
Hepatitis  C  or  chemotherapy-induced  thrombocytopenia  (see  Table  28).  The  doses  of  eltrombopag 
used  in  these  studies  ranged  from  3  mg  to  200  mg.  The  duration  of  treatment  with  eltrombopag 
ranged from 1 day in healthy volunteers up to 560 days in subjects with chronic ITP.  
A summary of the subjects contributing to the safety analysis and the main studies performed with 
eltrombopag in Chronic ITP is shown in Tables 29 and 30.

•  Adverse events  
Based  on  an  analysis  of  all  chronic  ITP  patients  receiving  eltrombopag  in  3  controlled  and  2 
uncontrolled  clinical  studies  (updated  cut-off  date  10  December  2008),  the  overall  incidence  of 
adverse  events  in  subjects treated  with  eltrombopag was  82 %  (367/446).   The  median  duration  of 
exposure to eltrombopag was 304 days and patient year’s exposure was 377 in this study population. 
Data  on  adverse  events  is  summarised  for  the  pooled  TRA100773A  and  B  and  RAISE  studies  in

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were a total of 8 deaths in the eltrombopag ITP programme as of 1 August 2008: 1 subject in 
study TRA100773A, 1 subject in RAISE, 1 subject in REPEAT, 5 subjects in EXTEND. 
One death was reported in a subject treated with eltrombopag 50 mg in TRA100773A; this subject 
had a history of pneumonectomy due to lung cancer and died of cardiopulmonary failure which was 
not considered related to drug by the investigator, although proximal events of renal insufficiency, 
embolism, pulmonary embolism and hepatitis were considered related to the drug.   
In RAISE, a 43-year old female who had a baseline platelet count of 2,000/μL in the placebo group 
suffered  a  fatal  brain  stem  haemorrhage  six  days  after  initiation  of  study  medication,  which  was 
considered unrelated. 
No deaths  were reported in REPEAT during the on-therapy or the 4-week follow-up period of the 
study.  One  subject  was  diagnosed  with  pancreatic  cancer  (reported  as  an  unrelated  SAE)  6  days 
following the last dose of eltrombopag. Six months post-therapy, the subject died from that cancer. 
All 5 deaths in EXTEND were reported as unrelated to study medication. Two deaths occurred while 
the  subjects  were  on-therapy  (passenger  in  a  fatal  motor  vehicle  accident;  sudden  death,  definitive 
cause of death unknown). Three subjects died >30 days following discontinuation of eltrombopag.

Serious adverse events 
Severe  adverse  events  observed  during  the  clinical  development  in  ITP  trials  are  summarised  in 
Tables 36 and 37. The rate of discontinuation due to AEs in double blind trial was similar in both 
treatment  groups,  eltrombopag  and  placebo,  although  specific  AEs  (e.g. 
thromboembolic 
complications)  were  numerically  higher  among  eltrombopag  patients.  In  the  open  label  EXTEND 
trial 9 subjects suffered from AEs (in 6 of them SAEs) leading to drug discontinuation. 
Table 36. On-Therapy (+1 day) SAEs in TRA100773A and TRA100773B – Pooled Data 
Table 37. All On-therapy SAEs by Subject in RAISE (Safety Population) 
Bleedings 
A  higher  proportion  of  placebo  subjects  experienced  bleeding  events  on-therapy  AE  in  the  pooled 
data from TRA100773A and TRA100773B. Thirteen percent (13%) of placebo subjects [9 subjects, 
13 events] experienced on-therapy bleeding events as compared to 8% [9 subjects, 11 events] in the 
eltrombopag  group.  All  of  these  events  were  reported  as  unrelated  to  study  treatment  with  the 
exception  of  3  SAEs  (Grade  2  gastrointestinal  [GI]  haemorrhage,  cerebral  haemorrhage  and 
haematuria)  that  occurred  in  1  subject  in  the  placebo  group.  Post-therapy  bleeding  rates  in  the  2 
double blind studies are shown below in Tables 38 and 39.

Table 38. Post-therapy Bleeding AEs in TRA100773A and TRA100773B Pooled Data 
Table 39. Post-therapy Bleeding AEs in RAISE 
The placebo controlled trials do not show a clinically or statistically significant difference relative to 
placebo  in  terms  of  platelet  counts,  bleeding  events  or  need  for  rescue  medication  in  the  4  weeks 
following  discontinuation  of  therapy  with  eltrombopag.  Observations  from  the  open  label  studies 
support  the  conclusion  that  there  is  not  an  excess  bleeding  risk  associated  with  interruption  of 
eltrombopag. 
In both placebo-controlled trials as well as in open-label studies transient decrease in platelets count 
after  eltrombopag  discontinuation  has  been  analysed  according  to  the  following  definition: “a  post 
therapy platelet count <10,000/μL and at least 10,000/μL less than the baseline within the 4 weeks of 
study medication discontinuation”. The results are summarised in Table 40. 
Tables 40. Frequency of platelets count and bleeding after eltrombopag discontinuation. 
In summary in the 3 controlled clinical studies, transient decreases in platelet counts to levels lower 
than  baseline  were  observed  following  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  8 %  and  8 %  of  the 
eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. 
Thromboembolic complications 
From all ITP studies, a total of 17 out of 446 (3.8%) patients experienced TEE which included (in 
descending  order  of  occurrence)  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism,  acute  myocardial 
infarction,  cerebral  infarction,  embolism,  transient  ischaemic  attack,  and  suspected  PRIND 
(prolonged  reversible  ischemic  neurologic  deficiency)  (see  Table  41).  Of  them  6  (35%)  achieved 
maximum platelet count >400,000/μL at some time of treatment but only just 1 experienced the TEE 
close to their maximum platelet count (407,000/μL).  The role of other thrombophilic risk factors and 
conditions  in  subjects  who  experienced  TEEs  during  the  eltrombopag  trials  was  examined 
retrospectively, including concomitant therapies. No apparent relationship was shown.

Table  41.  Cumulative  Summary  of  Subjects  with  Confirmed  or  Suspected  TEEs  (Safety  Update 
Dataset, cut-off date 10 December 2008). 
Safety data emerged from study TPL104054/ELEVATE in thrombocytopenic subjects with chronic 
liver  disease  and  the  study  was  prematurely  stopped  by  the  IDMB  for  safety  reasons.  As  of  20 
August  2009,  6  of  261  (2.3%)  subjects  treated  with  eltrombopag  75  mg  had  experienced  7  TEEs 
(Table 42; Figure 5). These consisted of 7 events of the portal vein system (4 portal vein thromboses 
[PVT], 3 mesenteric vein thromboses) in 6 subjects and 1 myocardial infarction (MI). The median 
(range)  time  to  onset  since  the  first  dose  of  study  medication  was  22  days  (15,  53).  None  of  the 
events occurred on-therapy, the median (range) days since last dose was 9 days (1, 38). Five of the 7 
subjects experienced the TEE within 2 weeks of the last dose of study medication. Six of the cases 
correlated with platelet counts above 200,000/μL (see Figure 5).

In addition the ELEVATE IDMC also reviewed TEEs from the ongoing HCV studies 
(TPL103922/ENABLE 1 and TPL108390/ENABLE 2), an ongoing Japanese chronic liver disease 
study (TPL111913, n=38 subjects; recruitment completed), and from post-marketing safety reports 
(n=1239 patients, approximately 240 patient years, as of 14 August 2009). 
The ENABLE studies are 2 ongoing phase III studies of eltrombopag in subjects with HCV 
associated thrombocytopenia (platelets <75Gi/L). All subjects initiated treatment with 25mg 
eltrombopag and were able to dose escalate to a maximum of 100mg to achieve platelet counts of 
>90 or 100Gi/L depending upon the study. A total of 11 of the1185 ENABLE subjects (0.9%) had

experienced a TEE as of 1 September 2009. These consisted of 4 PVT events, 5 venous thrombosis 
events of the lower extremities, 1 MI event and 1 proximal occlusion of the right superficial femoral 
artery.  
TPL111913 was a dose ranging study in Japanese subjects with chronic liver disease that used 12.5, 
25 and 37.5mg dose which may approximate to 25, 50 and 75mg in a non East Asian population. In 
Part A of this study, 12 subjects were dosed with 12.5mg eltrombopag for 14 days. In Part B of the 
study, subjects received either 25mg or 37.5mg eltrombopag (14 and 12 subjects, respectively). 
Subjects were dosed for 14 days or 21 days depending upon whether or not the platelet count was 
above 80Gi/L at Day 15. One of the 38 subjects (2.6%) experienced an SAE of portal vein 
thrombosis 34 days after initiation of 37.5mg eltrombopag and 21 days since the last dose of 
eltrombopag.  
In the post-marketing setting, as of 30 September 2009, a total of 1544 patients in the US REMS 
program were exposed to eltrombopag for approximately 356 patient years. Six of the 1544 patients 
had reported a TEE. Events included 3 pulmonary embolisms, 1 deep vein thrombosis, 1 embolism 
and 1 cerebrovascular accident. Of the 6 events 1 was unresolved, 2 had improved outcome and 1 
was fatal. 
Bone marrow toxicity 
In  RAISE  and  REPEAT  per  protocol,  bone  marrow  examinations  were  to  be  performed  prior  to 
enrolment to confirm the diagnosis of ITP and to rule out myelodysplastic syndromes or other causes 
of  thrombocytopenia  in  subjects  who  responded  insufficiently  to  corticosteroids  or  if  the  WBC 
differential  and  the  subsequent  peripheral  blood  smear  confirm  the  presence  of  immature  or 
dysplastic cells. 
In EXTEND, bone marrow examinations were performed for the following reasons: 
a) Prior to enrolment into the study, for subjects who had not responded to prior ITP therapies with a 
platelet count increase to ≥100,000/μL or had not had a bone marrow examination consistent with a 
diagnosis of ITP within 3; and 
b) During the study, for subjects who had immature or dysplastic cells in the white blood cell (WBC) 
differential that were confirmed by peripheral blood smear microscopy. 
c) After dosing with eltrombopag for one year in EXTEND 
d) At any time at the Investigator’s discretion 
Bone  marrow  examinations  were  not  required  in  the  6-week  TRA100773A  and  TRA100773B 
studies. 
Bone  marrow  toxicity  data  come  from  EXTEND  (cut-off  date  10  December  2008)  where  subjects 
were to have a bone marrow examination performed after 12 months of treatment with eltrombopag. 
Additionally  bone  marrow  examinations  may  have  been  performed  at  any  time  for  other  reasons 
based upon local standards of care.  
86 subjects had been dosed for a median time of 12 months, none of the bone marrow exams were 
prompted by an abnormal peripheral blood smear. Of the 86 subjects 46 had a bone marrow aspirate 
done,  none  of  which  had an  abnormal  karyotype  or an  increase  bone  marrow  blast  count. The  on-
treatment  reports  for  three  of  the  86  subjects  did  not  mention  testing  for  reticulin  or  fibrosis.  The 
remaining  83  subjects  were  evaluable  for  reporting  bone  marrow  fibre  information  and  it  is 
summarised below: 
• Forty-eight subjects had either an MF Grade of 0 recorded in the eCRF (42 subjects), or ‘no’, ‘no 
significant increase’, ‘no evidence of fibrosis’ or ‘Grade 0’ reticulin documented in the bone marrow 
report (6 subjects). 
•  Thirty  subjects  had  either  an  MF  Grade  of  1  (26  subjects)  recorded  in  the  eCRF  or  ‘focal  mild’ 
reticulin documented in the bone marrow report (4 subjects). 
o  One  of  these  subjects  (Subject  58)  had  a  MF  Grade  of  1  in  the  eCRF  and  “slight  increase”  in 
collagen documented in the bone marrow report (collagen not documented in the eCRF). 
• Five subjects (Subjects 53, 61, 67, 1058 and 1241) had an MF Grade of 2 in the eCRF; with the 
exception of Subject 67, these subjects were presented in the original MAA. 
64/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  3/5 had no collagen described in the bone marrow report (Subjects 53, 67 and 1058); 
- 2/5 had collagen mentioned in the bone marrow report (Subjects 61 and 1241). 
4  subjects  had  a  reticulin  assessment  prior  to  and  after  treatment  with  eltrombopag.  Changes  in 
reticulin are described in Table 43, further follow up assessments have not been completed

Malignancies 
Five  (1.2%)  cases  of  malignancies  in  eltrombopag  group  and  1(1.4%)  in  placebo  group  have  been 
detected in all ITP studies. Among the 6 cases of malignancies observed in ITP studies, there were 2 
cases of haematological malignancies: 1 in placebo group and one in eltrombopag group. 
Hepatotoxicity  
Across  the  3  placebo-controlled  studies,  1  patient  in  the  placebo  group  and  1  patient  in  the 
eltrombopag group experienced a Grade 4 liver test abnormality. 
A  review  of  all  cases  of  liver  injury  reported  in  the  completed  studies  and  up  to  10  December  08 
from the on-going EXTEND study was provided. Drug induced liver injury (DILI) screening criteria 
for hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities (HBLA) were defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
or  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  ≥3x  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  and/or  bilirubin  or 
alkaline  phosphatase  (AP)  >1.5xULN.  An  analysis  of  time  to  onset,  age,  sex,  dose,  concomitant 
medications,  repeated  exposure  to  eltrombopag  and  outcome/resolution  of  the  HBLA  has  been 
provided. 
A  total  of  69  cases  of  HBLA  have  been  reported  (any  dose  of  eltrombopag  or  placebo).  60  were 
receiving eltrombopag. Among the 60 cases, 5 cases occurring with the doses of 30 mg (3 cases) and 
75  mg  (2  cases)  were  not  included  in  the  analysis  except  for  the  evaluation  of  the  time  to  onset. 
Therefore, 55 cases have been analysed. Summaries of all cases of HBLA for studies TRA100773A 
and TRA100773B (pooled data) and RAISE are presented in Tables 44 and 45.

Table 45. Summary of Subjects Meeting the DILI Screening Criteria for HBLA-RAISE 
Time  to  onset  varied  broadly.  In  TRA100773A-B  and  RAISE  studies,  DILI  occurred  in  the  first 
month of treatment (median: 15, 29 days respectively) but in EXTEND the median of time onset was 
3.5  months.  Bilirubin  occurred  in  a  shorter  time  than  transaminases  in  all  studies,  except  in 
TRA100773A-B in which median of time to onset for both bilirubin and ALT was 8 days. 
HBLA  was  observed  across  all  age  ranges.  Of  the  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  who  developed, 
HBLA 66% were female and 34% were male. Hepatotoxicity was more frequent in Asian subjects. 
The outcome was analysed in 61 cases (7 of them occurred in both EXTEND and previous studies). 
In  37  cases  the  HBLA  resolved,  12  resolved  after  eltrombopag  discontinuation  and  2  after  dose 
decrease. The remaining 23 cases the event resolved despite eltrombopag therapy continued. Of the 
66/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24  cases  in  which  the  event  did  not  resolve,  10  were  only  bilirubin  elevation  (6  with  Gilbert’s 
Syndrome). 
Half of the patients experienced only bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. 5 patients had elevations of 
transaminases  with  bilirubin  increases  and  met  Hy’s  Rule  Criteria.  In  two  cases  alternative  causes 
were  identified  (thromboembolism  of  the  liver  and  cardiac  failure,  cholecystitis).  In  one  case  the 
patient  experienced  sudden  elevations  of  transaminases  and  bilirubin  1  year  after  starting  therapy 
with  eltrombopag.  The  other  two  cases  fluctuations  on  elevations  of  transaminases  and  bilirubin 
occurred  during  a  long  period  of  time  (1  year,  5  months).  Bilirubin  increase  was  due  to  indirect 
bilirubin in the 3 cases. 
A  pharmacogenetic  study  identified  the  UGT1A1*28  allele  as  being  associated  with  elevated 
total bilirubin in the White subjects included in the eltrombopag clinical development program. 
This allele has been associated with Gilbert’s Syndrome in populations of European ancestry as 
well  as  hyperbilirubinaemia  and  toxicity  following  administration  of  some  drugs  in  which 
UGT1A1 contributes to the elimination of parent drug or metabolites. In East Asian populations 
UGT1A1*28  is  of  lower  frequency  and  other  alleles  of  diminished  activity  such  UGT1A1*6 
(absent in European populations) and UGT1A1*60 are important and these alleles contribute to 
Gilbert’s syndrome and are associated with some drug toxicities. The eltrombopag PGx analysis 
did  not  report  an  association  of  UGT1A1  alleles  with  total  bilirubin  elevation  in  Asian  ITP 
patients; however, only a limited number of Asian patients could be included in this analysis (3 
Asians with elevated total bilirubin and 33 Asian controls). 
Cataracts 
In the double-blind RAISE study patients had an ocular exam prior to enter in study and after starting 
the study at month 3 and 6. The frequency of incident cases of cataracts was similar for eltrombopag 
group (4.5%) and placebo group (4.9%). The frequency in cataract progression was slightly higher in 
eltrombopag group compared with placebo group. Prior to enter in the study 25 patients had cataracts 
(13 placebo, 12 eltrombopag group) and during the study, 4(33%) patients had a cataract progression 
in the eltrombopag group and 3(23%) in the placebo group.  
The  frequency  of  cataracts  (incident/progression)  was  similar  in  open  label  studies  (REPEAT  3%, 
EXTEND  5%).  All  patients  who  developed  cataracts  in  ITP  studies  had  chronic  treatment  with 
corticosteroids. 
Phototoxicity 
No difference in the frequency of skin and subcutaneous adverse events was demonstrated between 
the eltrombopag and placebo groups in the controlled trials. The frequency reported in the open label 
studies was similar to the placebo controlled studies.

Renal laboratory values 
Across the pooled data from TRA100773, 22 subjects showed an increase from baseline in creatinine 
(placebo: 4 subjects; 30 mg: 3 subjects; 50 mg: 13 subjects; 75 mg: 2 subjects). Five of these subjects 
(all receiving eltrombopag) were considered of clinical interest because they had multiple on-therapy 
creatinine values ≥0.3 mg/dL above their individual baseline. These subjects did not experience any 
AEs  potentially  related  to  renal  function,  and  an  improvement  or  normalization  of  their  creatinine 
values  was  reported  while  continuing  on  drug,  except  for  one  subject  whose  creatinine,  albeit 
remaining within normal values, had not yet returned to baseline at the end of the study.  
In  the  RAISE  one  subject  treated  with  eltrombopag  had  at  least  2  consecutive  assessments  ≥0.3 
mg/dL  above  baseline  and  above  the  ULN  (peaked  at  1.5xULN).  Thereafter,  the  values  decreased 
during  treatment  with  eltrombopag.  A  summary  of  the  subjects  with  increases  in  serum  creatinine 
from baseline is presented in Table 44. 
Table 44. Summary of Subjects with Increase(s) in Serum Creatinine from Baseline (greater than or 
equal to 0.3 mg/dL) at any Post-Baseline Visit - RAISE 
The rate of serum creatinine abnormal values was similar in the open label studies. 
Enhanced  renal  monitoring  was  added  to  the  ongoing  RAISE,  REPEAT,  and  EXTEND  studies  to 
detect the potential occurrence of renal toxicity. In this review eltrombopag was associated with liver 
injury with a frequency of 10-13%. 
Platelet function and antiplatelet antibodies

•  Safety in special populations 
Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. No relevant 
difference  in  the  type  and  frequency  of  adverse  events  were  noted.  However,  both  the  number  of 
patients and duration of treatment are not appropriate to draw clinical safety conclusions. 
Gender and age did not appear to have a critical impact in the safety of the drug. Representation of 
elderly  (>65  years)  and  very  elderly  (>75  years)  is  limited,  though  age  and  gender  distribution  in 
clinical trials generally mimics the real prevalence of the disease. 
Hepatic impairment 
The risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) has been found to be increased in patients with chronic 
liver disease treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for two weeks in preparation for invasive 
procedures. In a placebo-controlled study where eltrombopag was administered for 2 weeks in 
preparation for invasive procedures, 6 of 261 patients with chronic liver disease experienced 7 
thromboembolic events of the portal venous system. One additional patient developed a myocardial 
infarction 20 days after the last dose of study medication, which remains blinded (see section on 
thromboembolic complications). 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies have been submitted. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
See section on “Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events”. 
•  Post marketing experience 
No studies have been submitted. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of eltrombopag has been evaluated in 26 completed or ongoing clinical studies in 
1616 eltrombopag-treated and 247 placebo-treated healthy volunteers and patients with ITP, hepatitis 
C or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The total exposure in the ITP safety database is 446 
patients, being the main limitation of this safety database the long-term treatment. 
The risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) has been found to be increased in patients with chronic 
liver disease treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for two weeks in preparation for invasive 
procedures. This data emerged from the study ELEVATE in thrombocytopenic subjects with chronic 
liver disease and the study was prematurely stopped for safety reasons. The CHMP consulted an ad 
hoc  expert  group  to  provide  guidance  on  the  significance  of  these  events.  The  questions  and 
responses from the expert group are summarised below: 
1.  Please discuss the possible mechanism for the observed increase in thromboembolic events in 
the ELEVATE study. 
The  group  agreed  that  it  is  difficult  to  speculate  on  the  possible  mechanism  for  the  observed 
thromboembolic  events  in  ELEVATE  as  the  study  remains  blinded.  A  plausible  explanation  was 
based  on  the  rapid  increase  in  platelet  counts  observed  in  the  liver  impaired  population  due  to  the 
administration  of  a  higher  dose  of  eltrombopag  (75  mg  compared  to  25  mg  or  50  mg  in  the  ITP 
population). However in order to be reassured on this point information on whether the patients that 
experienced  thromboembolic  events  received  transfusions  in  addition  to  drug  treatment  and  what 
platelet counts were achieved in the patients who had no TEEs was needed. In addition, it could not 
69/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be  excluded  that  an  enhancement  of  the  pro-thrombotic  state  (hypercoagulability)  due  to  an 
imbalance in coagulation factors and/or the presence of endothelial damage seen in liver disease had 
contributed to the thromboembolic events. 
In  order  to  clarify  the  pathophysiology  of  the  observed  events  the  experts  expressed  the  need  for 
further characterisation upon unblinding of the ELEVATE study: 
-  Levels  of  pro-  and  anti- coagulant  factors  in  all  patients (i.e. protein C, protein S, anti-thrombin, 
factor VIII, von Willebrand factor). Time points suggested were: pre eltrombopag/placebo, at day 15 
and at time of TEE/ end of monitoring period. 
- Platelet activation status. 
- Endothelial activation status. 
Although  the  group  acknowledged  that  some  of  these  studies  would  not  be  feasible  if  not  pre-
specified in the original protocol of ELEVATE, it was recommended exploring them pre- and post- 
treatment  with  eltrombopag/placebo  in  the  context  of  liver  impaired  patients  independently  of  the 
ELEVATE  study  if  needed.  Doppler  ultrasound  to  assess  asymptomatic  portal  vein  thrombosis 
should also be considered. 
2.  Do the experts consider that the safety findings triggering the decision of the IDMC results 
seen in the Elevate study are relevant to the ITP population? 
The group was of the opinion that the thromboembolic events observed in the ELEVATE study are 
unlikely  to be  relevant  to  the  ITP  patient  population.  The  main  reasons  for  this  conclusion  are  the 
different  pathophysiology of  the  two  diseases,  the  different  aetiology of  the  thrombocytopenia  and 
the different type and pattern of thromboembolic events observed in the two populations. 
3.  What additional precautions do the experts think that could be taken to ensure a safe use of 
Revolade in ITP patients? 
The  group  expressed  the  need  to  include  a  strong  warning  in  the  SPC  highlighting  the  risk  of 
thromboembolic events in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. In this regard a full 
contraindication was not supported, however it was recommended the inclusion of a clear statement 
indicating  that  eltrombopag  should  not  be  used  in  these  patients  unless  the  expected  benefit 
outweighs the risk of portal vein thrombosis and including a recommended dose in those cases. The 
group voiced that especially for those patients undergoing invasive procedures, platelet transfusion 
remains a safer option. 
The  experts  agreed  that  the  SPC  should  contain  a  clear  cut  definition  of  the  term  “moderate  to 
severe” liver impairment, including Child-Pugh and Meld scores. 
Regarding  posology,  the  group  agreed  that  the  revised  cut-off  values  of  platelet  counts  for  dose 
adjustment  and  treatment  interruption proposed  by  the  Rapporteurs  were  adequate  to  minimise  the 
risk of thromboembolic episodes in the ITP population. 
The CHMP concurred with the expert group recommendations and concluded that the TEE findings 
in  the  ELEVATE  study  are  unlikely  to  be  relevant  to  the  ITP  patient  population.  However,  it  was 
agreed  that  strong  warnings  hightlighting  the  risks  associated  with  moderate  to  severe  liver 
impairment should be included in the SPC (sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). The agreed wording was the 
following: 
“Eltrombopag should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh score ≥ 7) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous 
thrombosis. 
If the use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary, the starting dose must be 25 mg once daily. 
70/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) has been found to be increased in patients with chronic 
liver disease treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for two weeks in preparation for invasive 
procedures” 
In  order  to  further  characterise  the  risk  associated  with  liver  impairment,  the  Applicant  has 
committed  to  provide  to  the  CHMP  the  final  results  of  the  ELEVATE  study  (Study  TPL104054) 
including  PK  and  PD  data  when  they  become  available  (study  still  blinded,  report  expected  to  be 
available September 2010). Moreover, the Applicant will further assess, from stored samples in the 
ELEVATE study, the potential effect of eltrombopag on the unstable coagulation balance (pro- vs. 
anti-coagulant factors production) in this patient population.  
Based on the result ELEVATE study in which there was  an observable close relationship between 
high  platelet  counts  and  TE  complications  (five  out  of  7  patients,  thromboembolic  complications 
took  place  at  the  time  of  the  maximum  platelet  count  above  200,000/μL  for  each  individual)  the 
CHMP  requested  the  Applicant  a  revised  and  more  conservative  cut-off  points  for  dosing 
adjustment, taking on board that the key aspect in the ITP patient population is to maintain platelet 
count  above  the  threshold  considered  to  be  associated  to  bleeding  risk  (50,000/μL).  The  CHMP 
considered  that  there  was  no  clinical  justification  for  the  administration  of  eltrombopag  in 
patients with platelet count ≥ 250,000/μL. With this value there is a broad safety margin of 
bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (more than 200,000/μL). This was also agreed by experts 
consulted by the CHMP as summarised above. The following posology has been recommended 
in the SPC: 
Platelet count 
< 50,000/μL  following  at  least 
2 weeks of therapy 
≥ 50,000/μL to ≤ 150,000/μL 
Dose adjustment or response 
Increase daily dose by 25 mg to a maximum of 75 mg/day. 
Use  lowest  dose  of  eltrombopag  and/or  concomitant  ITP 
treatment  to  maintain  platelet  counts  that  avoid  or  reduce 
bleeding. 
> 150,000/μL to ≤ 250,000/μL 
Decrease  the  daily  dose  by  25 mg.  Wait  2 weeks  to  assess  the 
effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments. 
> 250,000/μL 
Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring 
to twice weekly.  
Once  the  platelet  count  is ≤ 100,000/μL,  reinitiate  therapy  at  a 
daily dose reduced by 25 mg. 
Several  risks  need  to  be  further  assessed  in  a  larger  population  than  the  one  studied,  therefore  the 
Applicant  has  submitted  a  comprehensive  risk  management  plan  and  has  committed  to  perform

including 
Serum ALT, AST and bilirubin should be measured prior to initiation of eltrombopag, every 2 weeks

serum liver tests should be evaluated with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are 
71/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confirmed, serum liver tests should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve, stabilise, or return 
to baseline levels.  Eltrombopag should be discontinued if ALT levels increase (≥ 3X the upper limit 
of  normal  [ULN])  and  are:  progressive,  persistent  for  ≥ 4  weeks,  accompanied  by  increased  direct 
bilirubin,  or  accompanied  by  clinical  symptoms  of  liver  injury  or  evidence  for  hepatic 
decompensation. Caution should be taken when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic 
disease. 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of eltrombopag in pregnant women therefore the 
potential risk for humans is unknown and eltrombopag is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  contraception.  In  addition  it  is  not  known  whether 
eltrombopag or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Warnings during pregnancy and lactation 
have been included in section 4.6 of the SPC. 
In order to further characterise the uncertainties associated with eltrombopag treatment, the applicant 
has provided new information clarifying how the risk of eltrombopag will be estimated. The US Risk 
Evaluation  and  Mitigation  Strategy  (REMS)  program  will  be  the  main  source  to  obtain  data  for 
eltrombopag-risk,  and  two  registries  included  in  the  pharmacovigilange  plan  (UK-ITP  and  PARC-
ITP  registries)  will  provide  information  on  the  background  risk  of  ITP  disease.  Comparison  on 
incidence rates among REMS and UK-ITP or PARC-ITP registry should be used to estimate risk of 
thromboembolic events and malignancies. 
In addition the applicant has committed to assess the levels of bone marrow fibers (reticulin and/or 
collagen) at baseline and any change from baseline after 1 and 2 years of treatment with eltrombopag 
in adult subjects with chronic ITP (study TRA112940). The final study report will be submitted as a 
post-authorisation commitment. 
Additional risk minimization activities have been agreed for hepatic events, thromboembolic events, 
reoccurrence  of  thrombocytopenia,  bone  marrow  fibrosis  and  malignancies.  These  risks  will  be 
addressed  in  a  healthcare  professional  information  pack  containing  educational  materials  to  be 
provided prior to launch to all physicians who intend to prescribe eltrombopag. 
An evaluation of the proposed risk minimization plan should be submitted periodically. Specifically, 
for  the  hepatic  monitoring  an  evaluation  should  be  presented  every  6  months  together  with  the 
PSURs and RMP updates.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the 
following  risk  minimisation  activities are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal 
product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report. 
2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  quality  of  the  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of 
the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Eltrombopag  does  not  stimulate  platelet  production  in  mice,  rats  or  dogs  because  of  unique  TPO 
receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animals do not fully model potential adverse effects 
related  to  the  pharmacology  of  eltrombopag  in  humans,  including  the  reproduction  and 
carcinogenicity studies. 
75/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment-related cataracts were detected in rodents and were dose and time-dependent. At ≥ 6 times 
the human clinical exposure based on AUC, cataracts were observed in mice after 6 weeks and rats 
after 28 weeks of dosing. At  ≥ 4 times  the human clinical exposure based on AUC, cataracts were 
observed  in  mice  after  13 weeks  and  in  rats  after  39 weeks  of  dosing.  Cataracts  have  not  been 
observed  in  dogs  after  52 weeks  of  dosing  (2  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC).  
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Renal tubular toxicity was observed in studies of up to 14 days duration in mice and rats at exposures 
that were generally associated with morbidity and mortality. Tubular toxicity was also observed in a 
2 year oral carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day.  Effects were less 
severe at lower doses and were characterized by a spectrum of regenerative changes.  The exposure 
at the lowest dose was 1.2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC.  Renal effects were not 
observed in rats after 28 weeks or in dogs after 52 weeks at exposures 4 and 2 times respectively, the 
human clinical exposure based on AUC.  The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Hepatocyte degeneration and/or necrosis, often accompanied by increased serum liver enzymes, was 
observed in mice, rats and dogs at doses that were associated with morbidity and mortality or were 
poorly tolerated.  No hepatic effects were observed after chronic dosing in rats (28 weeks) or dogs 
(52 weeks) at exposures up to 4 or 2 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC. 
At poorly tolerated doses in rats and dogs (> 10 times maximum human clinical exposure based on 
AUC), decreased reticulocyte counts and regenerative bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia (rats only) 
were observed in short term studies. There were no effects of note on red cell mass or reticulocyte 
counts  after  dosing  for  up  to  28  weeks  in  rats,  52  weeks  in  dogs  and  2  years  in  mice  or  rats  at 
maximally tolerated doses which were 2 to 4 times the maximum human clinical exposure based on 
AUC. 
Endosteal hyperostosis was observed in a 28 week toxicity study in rats at a non-tolerated dose of 
60 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum human clinical exposure based on AUC). There were no bone 
changes observed in mice or rats after lifetime exposure (2 years) at 4 times the  maximum  human 
clinical exposure based on AUC. 
Eltrombopag  was  not  carcinogenic  in  mice  at  doses  up  to  75 mg/kg/day  or  in  rats  at  doses  up  to 
40 mg/kg/day  (exposures  up  to  4  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC).  Eltrombopag 
was  not  mutagenic  or  clastogenic  in  a  bacterial  mutation  assay  or  in  two  in  vivo  assays  in  rats 
(micronucleus  and  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis,  10  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on 
Cmax).  In  the  in  vitro  mouse  lymphoma  assay,  eltrombopag  was  marginally  positive  (< 3-fold 
increase in mutation frequency). These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that eltrombopag does 
not pose a genotoxic risk to humans. 
Eltrombopag  did  not  affect  female  fertility,  early  embryonic  development  or  embryofoetal 
development  in  rats  at  doses  up  to  20 mg/kg/day  (2  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on 
AUC).    Also  there  was  no  effect  on  embryofoetal  development  in  rabbits  at  doses  up  to 
150 mg/kg/day,  the  highest  dose  tested  (0.5  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC).  
However, at a maternally toxic dose of 60 mg/kg/day (6 times the human clinical exposure based on 
AUC) in rats, eltrombopag treatment was associated with embryo lethality (increased pre- and post-
implantation loss), reduced foetal body weight and gravid uterine weight in the female fertility study 
and a low incidence of cervical ribs and reduced foetal body weight in the embryofoetal development 
study.  Eltrombopag did not affect male fertility in rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day, the highest dose 
tested (3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC). In the pre- and post-natal development 
study  in  rats,  there  were  no  undesirable  effects  on  pregnancy,  parturition  or  lactation  of  F0 female 
rats at maternally non-toxic doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) and no effects on the growth, development, 
neurobehavioral  or  reproductive  function  of  the  offspring  (F1).  Eltrombopag  was  detected  in  the 
plasma  of  all  F1  rat  pups  for  the  entire  22 hour  sampling  period  following  administration  of 
medicinal  product  to  the  F0  dams,  suggesting  that  rat  pup  exposure  to  eltrombopag  was  likely  via 
lactation. 
76/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  vitro  studies  with  eltrombopag  suggest  a  potential  phototoxicity  risk;  however,  in  rodents  there 
was no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity (10 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) or 
ocular phototoxicity (≥ 5 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC). 
Efficacy 
Eltrombopag increases platelet count in patients with chronic ITP unresponsive to at least one first 
line  therapy  (corticosteroids  or  immunoglobulins).  This  effect  has  been  shown  to  be  superior  to 
placebo in both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients in two well-designed and conducted 
placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  of  short-term  (6  weeks)  and  medium-term  (6  months)  duration. 
Open  label  extension  studies  have  confirmed  this  effect.  Duration  of  response  in  platelet  count  is 
longer with eltrombopag than with placebo, being consistently shown in the clinical database. 
Secondary  analyses  have  consistently  reported  an  association  between  eltrombopag  and  reduced 
bleedings. The association was essentially driven by mild to moderate cutaneous bleedings, however 
an effect on severe bleedings has also been consistently observed in secondary analyses. In addition, 
greater  discontinuation  of  concomitant  therapies  was  observed  with  eltrombopag  compared  to 
placebo. 
The response to eltrombopag shows variability, especially in cases with over-response (platelet count 
above 400,000/μL). This is particularly relevant considering that full therapeutic response can take 
place as early as during the first week of therapy. In addition, response to eltrombopag in patients 
with very low platelet count (<15,000/μL ) is considerably lower, although it is significantly different 
from placebo.  
Safety 
The safety profile of eltrombopag has been evaluated based on data from 26 completed or ongoing 
clinical studies in 1616 eltrombopag-treated and 247 placebo-treated healthy volunteers and patients 
with ITP, hepatitis C or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The doses of eltrombopag used in 
these studies ranged from 3 mg to 200 mg. The duration of treatment with eltrombopag ranged from 
1 day in healthy volunteers up to 560 days in subjects with chronic ITP. 
Adverse reactions observed during eltrombopag treatment included headache (13%); nausea, alanine 
aminotransferase  increased  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (4%);  diarrhoea  and  fatigue 
(3%);  paraesthesia,  constipation,  rash,  pruritus,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  cataract,  arthralgia, 
myalgia and hyperbilirubinaemia (2%), abdominal pain upper, alopecia, dry eye, oedema peripheral, 
muscle spasm, bone pain, hepatic function abnormal and insomnia (1%). 
Safety  concerns  included  hepatobiliary  laboratory  abnormalities,  thromboembolic  events,  post-
therapy recurrence of thrombocytopenia, bone marrow reticulin formation and risk of bone marrow 
fibrosis, haematological malignancies, cataracts and loss of response to eltrombopag. 
Eltrombopag administration can cause abnormal liver function. In clinical studies with eltrombopag, 
increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin 
were observed. Findings were mostly mild (Grade 1-2), reversible and not accompanied by clinically 
significant symptoms that would indicate an impaired liver function. Across the 3 placebo-controlled 
studies, 1 patient in the placebo group and 1 patient in the eltrombopag group experienced a Grade 4 
liver test abnormality. 
Among  446  adult  chronic  ITP  patients  receiving  eltrombopag,  17  subjects  experienced 
thromboembolic  events,  which  included  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism,  acute 
myocardial  infarction,  cerebral  infarction,  embolism,  transient  ischaemic  attack,  and  suspected 
PRIND (prolonged reversible ischemic neurologic deficiency). 
The  risk  of  thromboembolic  events  has  been  found  to  be  increased  in  patients  with  chronic  liver 
disease treated with eltrombopag. These findings have been considered unlikely to be relevant to the 
ITP patient population (conclusion supported by an ad hoc expert group). 
77/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  induction  of  reticulin  formation  and  the  potential  development  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis  is  a 
serious  safety  concern.  There  are  limited  data  suggesting  that  eltrombopag  is  associated  with 
reticulin  formation  in  the  bone  marrow  (collagen  formation  in  3  cases)  however  whether  this  is  a 
finding likely to have clinical consequences on the long term is still uncertain. In addition, for Mpl 
ligands,  such  as  eltrombopag,  there  is  a  theoretical  concern  that  they  may  stimulate  the  growth 
haematopoietic  malignancies,  or  increase  progression  of  MDS  to  acute  myelogenous  leukaemia 
(AML).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  
•  User consultation 
The Applicant performed a readability testing (“user consultation”) and a satisfactory report has been 
provided. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The benefits of eltrombopag in terms of platelet counts have been established in several independent 
clinical  trials  on  a  short  and  long-term  basis.  In  secondary  analyses,  eltrombopag  was  also 
consistently associated with a reduction of the risk of bleedings.  
Adverse reactions observed during eltrombopag treatment included headache (13%); nausea, alanine 
aminotransferase  increased  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (4%);  diarrhoea  and  fatigue 
(3%);  paraesthesia,  constipation,  rash,  pruritus,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  cataract,  arthralgia, 
myalgia and hyperbilirubinaemia (2%), upper abdominal pain, alopecia, dry eye, oedema peripheral, 
muscle spasm, bone pain, hepatic function abnormal and insomnia (1%). 
In  addition  during  treatment  with  eltrombopag  a  number  of  risks  and  uncertainties  have  been 
identified. These include hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities, thromboembolism events and post 
therapy  recurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  as  identified  risks  and  bone  marrow  reticulin  formation, 
haematological  malignancies,  renal  toxicity,  phototoxicity,  cataracts,  haematological  changes  and 
endosteal hyperostosis as potential risks.  
In  splenectomised  patients  refractory  or  intolerant  to  first  line  therapies  (corticosteroids  and 
immunoglobulins),  the  benefits  of  eltrombopag  outweigh  the  risks.  However,  considering  the 
unknown  risks,  the  benefit-risk  balance  cannot  be  considered  positive  for  non-splenectomised 
patients, for whom splenectomy is a therapeutic option that could potentially affect the course of the 
disease. Therefore, the indication for non-splenectomised patients has been restricted from the one 
that the Applicant initially applied and eltrombopag may be considered as second line treatment only 
when surgery is contra-indicated. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of 
the opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 
2.3. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Revolade is not similar to Nplate within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
78/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit balance of Revolade in the treatment of: 
‘Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered as second line treatment for adult 
non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated’ 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation. 
In  addition,  the  CHMP,  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  EC  No  141/2000,  considers 
Revolade not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to 
Nplate for the same therapeutic indication. 
Furthermore, the CHMP takes note that the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan is not completed yet 
as none of the measures are completed.

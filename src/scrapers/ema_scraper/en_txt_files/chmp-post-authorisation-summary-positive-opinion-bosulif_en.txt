On 22 February 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Bosulif. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Pfizer Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication for Bosulif as follows2: 
Bosulif is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: 
•  newly-diagnosed chronic phase (CP) Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML). 
•  CP, accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Ph+ CML previously treated with one or 
more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) [TKI(s)] and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are 
not considered appropriate treatment options. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

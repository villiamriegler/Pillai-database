1.  Introduction 
On January 30th 2015, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for study NO1159, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical clinical overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study NO1159 is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The study medication was provided as levetiracetam (LEV) 500mg tablets. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Description of the study 
Title:  
“A double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of adjunctive treatment with oral levetiracetam (L059) in epilepsy patients aged ≥16 years with 
generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures” 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of LEV treatment used as adjunctive therapy 
in Japanese and Chinese epilepsy patients aged ≥16 years with uncontrolled GTC seizures 
despite treatment with 1 or 2 AED(s). The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of LEV treatment. 
Study design 
N01159 was a double-blind, randomized, 2-arm (1:1), parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study in Japanese and Chinese subjects aged ≥16 years with uncontrolled GTC 
seizures, despite treatment with 1 or 2 concomitant AEDs. The study was conducted at 95 sites 
located in Japan and 20 sites located in China. Subjects were screened at 39 sites in Japan and 
19 sites in China. 
This study was conducted for 38 weeks and consisted of 4 periods, excluding the 4-week 
Retrospective Baseline. For those subjects without retrospective Baseline documentation, the 
Rapporteur’s assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/382391/2015 
Page 4/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study duration was 42 weeks. 
  Baseline Period (8 weeks: 4-week Retrospective Period and 4-week Prospective Period with 
single-blind placebo (PBO) treatment [or an 8-week Prospective Baseline Period for those 
subjects without retrospective Baseline documentation]) 
  Dose Adjustment Period (12 weeks) 
 
Evaluation Period (16 weeks) 
  Conversion (4 weeks) or Withdrawal Period (6 weeks including the 2-week follow-up) 
For a subject who completed the Evaluation Period, the investigator decided whether the subject would 
have benefited from continuing the treatment with open-label LEV at the end of the Evaluation Period. 
The treatment with open-label LEV was defined as LEV treatment in the long-term follow-up study 
N01361 in Japan or continuation of treatment with commercial Keppra® under the Named Patient 
Program in China. 
In case the investigator decided to discontinue the subject from the study treatment, the subject went 
through the Withdrawal Period in order to stop the study medication. 
Study population /Sample size 
A required sample size of 116 subjects per treatment group (232 in total) was planned; the required 
number of Japanese subjects was 13 subjects per group (26 in total) and the required number of 
Chinese subjects was 103 subjects per group (206 in total). 
A total of 361 subjects were screened at 58 sites: 303 subjects screened at 19 sites in China and 58 
subjects screened at 39 sites in Japan. A total of 251 subjects were randomized (125 to PBO and 126 
to LEV). Of the 251 subjects randomized and included in the Randomized Set (RS), 141 subjects 
(56.2%) completed the study; a greater proportion of subjects randomized to LEV (64.3%) completed 
the study compared with subjects randomized to PBO (48.0%). The majority of subjects (82.9%) 
entered the open-label study N01361 (in Japan [81.4%]) or the Named Patient Program (in China 
[83.2%]). 
A total of 15 subjects were <18 years old at study entry (10 subjects were 17 years old; 5 were 
16 years old). Four of these subjects were female; 11 were male. See Table 4-1. 
Main criteria for inclusion 
Male or female subjects aged ≥16 years at Visit 1 must have had GTC seizures that were classifiable 
according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of epileptic seizures 
(Commission on Classification and Terminology of the ILAE, 1981).  
Subjects must have had at least 3 GTC seizures during the 8-week Combined Baseline Period (at least 
1 GTC seizure during the 4-week Retrospective Baseline Period and at least 1 GTC seizure during the 
4-week Prospective Baseline Period). 
Historical seizure information (including type, frequency, and date) must have been 
prospectively recorded on a daily record card (DRC) in order to be acceptable. For subjects 
without retrospective Baseline documentation, an 8-week Prospective Baseline Period should

have been done. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of 1 or 2 AEDs for the last 4 weeks 
(potassium bromide and sodium bromide for the last 12 weeks) prior to the Combined Baseline 
Period and during the Combined Baseline Period. 
Treatment 
The study medication was provided as LEV 500mg tablets. The selected doses of this study were 
1000mg/day and 3000mg/day (2000mg/day for fallback option due to an issue of tolerability).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy variable was the percentage reduction from the Combined 
Baseline (a 4-week Retrospective Baseline + 4-week Prospective Baseline or 8-week Prospective 
Baseline) in the GTC seizure frequency per week over the 28-week Treatment Period (Dose 
Adjustment + Evaluation Periods). 
The secondary efficacy variables included: 
 
The percentage reduction in GTC seizure frequency per week from the Combined Baseline 
over the Evaluation Period

  GTC seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or more reduction 
from the Combined Baseline in the frequency of GTC seizures) during the Treatment Period 
  GTC seizures 50% responder rate (the proportion of subjects with 50% or more reduction 
from the Combined Baseline in the frequency of GTC seizures) during the Evaluation Period 
  GTC seizure freedom over the Evaluation Period 
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Levetiracetam plasma concentrations were determined. 
Safety: The following safety information was collected during the study: 
  Adverse events (AEs) 
 
 
Laboratory assessments, including blood biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
  Vital signs 
  Body weight 
Statistical Methods 
In general, summaries were presented: 
  By treatment group (LEV, PBO) 
 
For all subjects (ie, across treatment groups including PBO), with exception of exposure 
information and almost all safety presentations 
 
For LEV dose groups (LEV 1000mg/day, LEV 2000-3000mg/day): demography, epilepsy 
characteristics, and efficacy analyses 
Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses were performed for the FAS. The primary and 
secondary efficacy variables were also analyzed on the Per-Protocol Set (PPS) in order to verify 
the robustness of the results. Safety and exposure data were analyzed on the SS and PK data 
were analyzed on the Pharmacokinetic Per-Protocol Set (PK-PPS). 
Comparisons were made between LEV (total) and PBO treatment groups. Comparisons between 
LEV 1000mg/day and PBO (pooled) and between LEV 2000-3000mg/day and PBO (pooled) 
were exploratory and planned for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. 
Seizures, including seizure type, were documented in a DRC. This information was transferred 
into the Seizure Count electronic Case Report form (eCRF) at each visit retrospectively for the 
interval between the current and the previous visit. Seizure types for the Retrospective Baseline 
Period were documented in the Historical Seizure Count (and Historical Cluster Count) eCRF by 
the ILAE (1981) classification code. Seizures other than generalized seizures (IIA1, IIA2, IIB, 
IIC, IID, IIE, and IIF) were collectively reported as other seizures in the Seizure Count eCRF for 
Rapporteur’s assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Visit 1.5 and later. For this reason, seizures classified into IA, IB, IC, and III during the 
Retrospective Baseline Period were pooled into other seizures in the listings. Generalized tonic 
clonic seizures were seizures with the ILAE seizure code IIE. 
The primary efficacy variable was the percentage reduction from the Combined Baseline in the 
GTC seizure frequency per week over the 28-week Treatment Period. The percentage reduction 
was (B-T) / B*100 where B represented the Combined Baseline Period seizure frequency per 
week and T represented the Treatment Period seizure frequency per week. 
The derivation of the number of GTC seizures during the Combined Baseline standardized to a 
1-week period, also called GTC seizure frequency per week during Combined Baseline, 
depended on whether a subject had an “8-week Prospective Baseline” or a combined “4-week 
Retrospective + 4-week Prospective Baseline.” 
In general, seizures during Baseline were documented at Visit 1 in the Historical Seizure Count 
eCRF as well as in the Seizure Count eCRF at Visit 1.5 and Visit 2. 
The number of GTC seizures standardized to a week period, also called GTC seizure frequency 
per week, was computed for a period (eg, Evaluation, Treatment Period) or time interval 
(eg, time interval from one to the next visit) as: 
period)/(Number of days within this period with nonmissing seizure information)] × 7 
certain 
period)/(End date of the period - Start date (or time interval) - number of days with missing 
seizure information)] × 7 
where dates with missing seizure information, gaps in dates, days with nonmissing information, 
and days with zero seizure counts were derived as above for the subjects with an “8-week 
Prospective Baseline.” 
The confirmatory primary analysis was an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the endpoint 
“percentage reduction from Combined Baseline of GTC seizures per week” using “treatment”; 
ie, LEV and PBO, and “country” as factors (categorical predictors) and “Combined Baseline 
GTC seizure frequency per week” as a covariate (a continuous predictor). 
Least squares means for the treatment effects and their difference were provided together with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 2-sided p-value for the F-test for treatment effect was 
calculated. Inferences within ANCOVA were based on Type III sums of squares. 
The statistical hypotheses, null hypothesis (H0) and alternate hypothesis (H1), are as follows:

where μLEV and μPBO are adjusted means for LEV and PBO, respectively. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
Overall, a total of 361 subjects were screened at 58 sites: 303 subjects screened at 19 sites in 
China and 58 subjects screened at 39 sites in Japan. A total of 251 subjects were randomized 
(125 to PBO and 126 to LEV). Of the 251 subjects randomized and included in the RS, 
141 subjects (56.2%) completed the study; a greater proportion of subjects randomized to LEV 
(64.3%) completed the study compared with subjects randomized to PBO (48.0%). The majority 
of subjects (82.9%) intended to enter the Named Patient Program or the open-label study; 
83.2% of subjects in China intended to enter the Named Patient Program and 81.4% of subjects 
in Japan intended to enter the open-label study N01361. 
Overall, 110 subjects (43.8%) discontinued the study; there was a higher rate of discontinuation 
in the PBO group (52.0%) compared with the LEV group (35.7%). In both treatment groups, the 
most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy (LEV: 21.4%; PBO: 32.0%) 
followed by AE (LEV: 3.2%; PBO: 6.4%) and protocol violation (LEV: 4.0%; PBO: 4.8%). 
Paediatric subjects 
A total of 15 subjects were <18 years old at study entry (10 subjects were 17 years old; 5 were 
16 years old). Four of these subjects were female; 11 were male. Eight subjects were randomized 
to PBO and 7 to LEV. 
Efficacy results 
Levetiracetam was shown to be efficacious across a variety of endpoints when used as an 
adjunctive therapy with 1 or 2 other AEDs in Chinese and Japanese subjects aged ≥16 years of 
age. In N01159, subjects were first randomized to PBO or LEV 1000mg/day; subjects who 
reported no GTC seizures during the Dose Adjustment Period continued on the LEV dose of 
1000mg/day (or PBO) and those who reported at least 1 GTC seizure during the same period 
increased the dose to LEV 3000mg/day or PBO (and could have decreased their dosage back to 
2000mg/day as a fallback option if 3000mg/day was not tolerated). 
Overall, subjects treated with LEV had an adjusted mean percentage reduction in the frequency 
of GTC seizures per week between the Combined Baseline Period and Treatment Period of 
68.75%, which was a statistically significant improvement over PBO (12.62%, p<0.0001).

By LEV dose, the adjusted mean percentage reduction in the frequency of GTC seizures per 
week between the Combined Baseline Period and Treatment Period was 87.67% for subjects in 
the LEV 1000mg/day group and 54.76% for subjects in the LEV 2000 to 3000mg/day group; 
both dose groups showed statistically significant improvement over PBO (12.84%, p<0.0001). 
Subgroup analyses showed some descriptive differences in the median percentage reduction in 
GTC seizure frequency per week over the Treatment Period for Baseline GTC seizure frequency 
(subjects with <1 seizure per week at Baseline showed a greater reduction compared with 
subjects with ≥1 seizure per week). There did not appear to be any differences with regard to 
country, gender, weight, the number of concomitant AEDs, or whether the epilepsy was 
classified as idiopathic or symptomatic. 
Generalized tonic-clonic seizure frequency also showed improvement from the Combined 
Baseline Period over the Evaluation Period; subjects treated with LEV had an adjusted mean 
percentage reduction in the frequency of GTC seizures per week between the Combined Baseline 
Period and Evaluation Period of 68.51%, which was an improvement over PBO (4.16%, 
p<0.0001). 
The GTC 50% responder rates for the Treatment Period in the LEV group were higher compared 
with the PBO group (77.8% vs 28.4%, respectively). Subjects in the LEV group had higher odds of 
being a responder compared with subjects in the PBO group (OR: 9.222; p<0.0001). Similar 
results were observed for the Evaluation Period. 
Generalized tonic-clonic seizure freedom over the Evaluation Period in subjects in the LEV 
group was higher compared with the PBO group (29.6% vs 3.1%; p<0.0001). In addition, 
subjects in the LEV group had higher odds of being seizure free compared with subjects in the 
PBO group (OR: 14.237; p<0.0001). 
Overall, the time to first GTC seizure during the Evaluation Period for 50% of subjects (95% CI) 
was 54 days (23 to 82) in the LEV group compared with 9 days (6 to 13) in the PBO group. 
Similarly, the time to second GTC seizure during the Treatment Period for 50% of subjects (95% 
CI) was 55 days (41 to 117) for the LEV group compared with 19 days (15 to 24) in the PBO 
group. 
Safety results 
The following safety information was collected during the study: 
  AEs 
 
Laboratory assessments, including blood biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis

Overall, the incidence of any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar in the 
LEV and PBO groups (57.1% and 52.0% of subjects, respectively). Three subjects died during 
the study; all were in the PBO group and all were Chinese. A total of 5 subjects reported serious 
TEAEs during the Treatment Period; the incidence was lower in the LEV group (1 subject 
[0.8%]), compared with the PBO group (4 subjects [3.2%]). One subject in the LEV group 
(Subject 012-00329) experienced a serious AE during the Withdrawal Period. The incidences of 
discontinuations due to TEAEs, TEAEs requiring dose change, and severe TEAEs were similar 
in the LEV and PBO groups. The incidence of any TEAEs was slightly higher in the LEV group, 
compared with the PBO group during the Dose Adjustment Period (46.8% and 40.8%, 
respectively) and Evaluation Periods (37.7% and 31.4%, respectively); the incidence was higher 
during the Dose Adjustment Period, compared with the Evaluation Period. 
Overall, for the system organ classes (SOCs) with most frequently reported TEAEs (≥4% of 
subjects in any treatment group in the overall population), the incidence was higher in the LEV 
group, compared with the PBO group, for the Investigations SOC; and the incidence was lower 
in the LEV group, compared with the PBO group, for the Nervous system disorders SOC. The 
incidence of most frequently reported TEAEs was higher in the LEV group, compared with the PBO 
group, for the preferred terms (PTs) of protein urine present, diarrhoea, constipation, 
neutrophil count decreased, and GGT increased. The incidence of the TEAE of dizziness was 
lower in the LEV group, compared with the PBO group. The most frequently reported TEAE PT 
during all study periods was nasopharyngitis. During the Dose Adjustment and Evaluation 
Periods, the incidence of nasopharyngitis was similar in the LEV and PBO groups. For the 
TEAEs with higher incidences during the study in the LEV group, compared with the PBO 
group, the incidences of the PTs of diarrhoea and constipation were higher during the Dose 
Adjustment Period, compared with the Evaluation Period; the incidences of the PTs of protein 
urine present, neutrophil count decreased, and GGT increased were similar during the Dose 
Adjustment and Evaluation Periods. 
Overall, the incidence of any TEAEs was similar in male and female subjects in both the LEV 
and PBO groups. The incidence of TEAEs by SOC and PT was similar in male and female 
subjects, with the exception of nasopharyngitis (lower incidence in male subjects in both the

LEV and PBO groups), protein urine present (higher incidence in male subjects in the LEV 
group, and no gender difference in the PBO group), and pyrexia (lower incidence in male 
subjects in the LEV group and a higher incidence in male subjects in the PBO group). 
Overall, a total of 3 subjects died during the study; all subjects were in the PBO group and all 
were Chinese (2 events of drowning were considered not related and 1 event of sudden 
unexplained death in epilepsy was considered related to study medication). In addition to the 
3 fatal events, 1 Chinese subject reported a serious TEAE of epilepsy. In Japanese subjects, there 
were no deaths and 1 serious TEAE of pneumonia. 
Overall, the incidence of any adverse drug reaction (ADR) was higher in the LEV group 
(23.8%), compared with the PBO group (13.6%). There were higher incidences in the LEV 
group, compared with the PBO group, for the most frequently reported ADR PTs of protein urine 
present, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, and somnolence. Almost all ADRs 
were mild or moderate in intensity; only 1 Chinese subject in the PBO group had a severe ADR. 
The incidence of any ADR was higher during the Dose Adjustment Period, compared with the 
Evaluation Period, in both the LEV and PBO groups. The incidence of any ADR was higher in 
the LEV group, compared with the PBO group, during both the Dose Adjustment and the 
Evaluation Periods. During the Dose Adjustment Period, there were higher incidences in the 
LEV group, compared with the PBO group, of the most frequently reported ADR PTs of protein 
urine present, neutrophil count decreased, and somnolence; the incidence of platelet count 
decreased was similar in the LEV and PBO groups. During the Evaluation Period, there were 
higher incidences in the LEV group, compared with the PBO group, of the most frequently 
reported ADR PTs of protein urine present, platelet count decreased, and neutrophil count 
decreased. The ADR of somnolence was not reported by any subjects during the Evaluation 
Period. 
Overall, mean and median changes from Baseline in hematology and blood chemistry values 
were similar in the LEV and PBO groups, and did not show any trends. Few subjects in the LEV 
and PBO groups had hematology or blood chemistry parameter values that shifted from not 
possibly clinically significant (PCS) at Baseline to PCS during the study. There were few TEAEs 
related to abnormal hematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis parameter results. The most frequently 
reported TEAE related to abnormal clinical laboratory parameter results was the PT of protein urine 
present. 
Overall, the changes from Baseline in mean and median vital signs were similar in the LEV and 
PBO groups, and did not show any trends. Few PCS abnormalities in vital sign results were

reported. Few TEAEs related to vital signs were reported. 
Overall, no clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG findings were reported during the study 
and there were no shifts from normal or abnormal not clinically significant at Baseline to 
abnormal clinically significant post-Baseline. 
Paediatric subjects 
Thirteen of the 15 subjects <18 years old (7 subjects in the PBO group and 6 subjects in the LEV 
group) had TEAEs. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, not related to study 
medication, and resolved. 
One subject in the PBO group (Subject #019-00505) had a fatal TEAE of sudden unexplained 
death in epilepsy and 1 subject in the LEV group (Subject #117-00219) had a serious TEAE of 
pneumonia (N01159 CSR Listing 7.4). 
Conclusion 
Based on the study results, the following conclusions were made: 
 
LEV at doses of 1000mg/day or 3000mg/day was effective in reducing GTC seizure 
frequency when used as an adjunctive therapy with 1 or 2 other AEDs in Chinese and 
Japanese epilepsy subjects with uncontrolled GTC seizures aged ≥16 years of age. 
 
The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety 
concerns were identified in this study. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Results from study N01159 show that LEV at doses of 1000mg/day or 3000mg/day was effective in 
reducing GTC seizure frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with 1 or 2 other AEDs in Japanese 
or Chinese subjects aged ≥16 years. 
The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns 
were identified in this study. 
The MAH considers that no changes to the approved EU Product Information for Keppra are proposed 
following the completion of this study.  
At this time, the MAH considers that the standard immediate-release formulations of Keppra allow for 
appropriate use of LEV in paediatric patients in the EU. This study was solely submitted in accordance 
with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation.

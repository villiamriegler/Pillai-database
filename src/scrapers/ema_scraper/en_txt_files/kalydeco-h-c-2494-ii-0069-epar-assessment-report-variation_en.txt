2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The  underlying  cause  of  cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  is  a  defect  in  the  gene  encoding  the  CF  transmembrane 
conductance  regulator  (CFTR)  protein.  The  CFTR  protein  is  an  epithelial  chloride  channel  that  aids  in 
regulating  salt  and  water  absorption  and  secretion  in  various  tissues.  This  function  is  defective  in 
patients with CF due to a loss of cell surface expression and/or function of CFTR protein. The failure of 
mutated  CFTR  protein  to  regulate  chloride  transport  results  in  the  multisystem  pathology  associated 
with CF. 
Since  the  introduction  and  continued  advances  of  newborn  and  antenatal  screening,  many  patients 
with  CF  are  identified  through  a  positive  screening  test  and  subsequently  diagnosed  within  the  first 
year of life. Approximately 60% of patients with CF in the EU and 83% of patients with CF in the UK 
are  diagnosed  by  1  year  of  age.  In  the  US,  more  than  80%  of  patients  with  CF  are  diagnosed  by  2 
years  of  age.  CF  affects  the  paediatric  population  and  approximately  half  of  the  total  CF  patient 
population  in  the  US,  EU,  and  Australia  and  approximately  40%  in  Canada  are  less  than  18  years  of 
age. 
Even  before  the  widespread  adoption  of  newborn  screening,  the  majority  of  CF  patients  were 
diagnosed  in  infancy  or  early  childhood  due  to  manifestations  of  the  disease.  In  patients  with  severe 
genotypes  (with  gating  mutations  such  as  G551D),  pancreatic  destruction  leading  to  pancreatic 
exocrine insufficiency begins in utero, and lung involvement is manifested by pulmonary inflammation 
and infection that begins shortly after birth. Loss of lung function is the major cause of morbidity and 
mortality.  CF  patients  as  young  as  1  month  show  the  presence  of  lung  disease.  High-resolution 
computed  tomography  studies  of  infants  with  CF  who  were  diagnosed  by  newborn  screening  but 
considered clinically healthy showed that structural lung damage is common even very early in disease 
progression.  In  a  cohort  of  81  well-treated  CF  patients  in  Australia,  by  the  age  of  3  years,  10%  had 
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  infection,  and  84%  had  evidence  of  bronchiectasis.  This  is  consistent  with 
results of inflammatory marker studies that found that airway inflammation begins in infancy. Airway 
inflammation  signals  the  beginning  of  the  destructive  cycles  of  chronic  inflammation,  infection,  and 
irreversible lung damage that are characteristic of CF lung disease. 
Exocrine  pancreatic  insufficiency  and  poor  nutritional  status  are  among  the  most  significant  clinical 
manifestations of CF in infants. These factors often lead to poor growth with subsequent growth delay, 
poorer  cognitive  development,  and  other  clinical  comorbidities  such  as  decreased  lung  function  and 
survival.  Malnourishment  is  associated  with  worsening  lung  function  in  children  with  CF  and  is  an 
independent  predictor  of  mortality  in  this  population.39  Fat  malabsorption  was  present  in  79%  of 
infants tested at 6 months and 92% of infants by 12 months of age. Notably, 18% of children with CF 
fall  below  the  US  CDC’s  fifth  percentile  for  weight  and  16%  of  children  fall  below  the  CDC’s  fifth 
percentile for height. Additionally, increased energy expenditure and appetite suppression due to lung 
disease contribute to poor somatic growth and poor nutritional status in young CF patients.  
Data  in  the  literature  suggest  that  early  therapeutic  intervention  is  beneficial  to  young  children  with 
CF;  studies  have  demonstrated  benefits  such  as  improved  measures  of  growth,  nutrition,  and  lung 
disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening. Moreover, treatments 
that target the functional defect of the mutated CFTR protein at a young age could postpone or even 
prevent  the  onset  of  clinical  manifestations  of  CF,  such  as  CF  lung  disease  and  impaired  exocrine 
pancreatic function. However, this remains to be proven as long-term data may be needed to that end.

This  application  is  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Kalydeco  (ivacaftor,  IVA),  to  include  treatment  of 
cystic fibrosis in children age 12 to less than 24 months who have one of the currently approved gating 
mutations in the CFTR gene for Kalydeco 50 mg & 75 mg Granules. Submitted study 124 is included in 
the  IVA  pediatric  investigation  plan  (PIP)  in  the  EU.  The  PDCO  agreed  that  the  open-label  roll-over 
Study 126 would be captured in the Kalydeco Risk Management Plan. The applicant received scientific 
advice from the CHMP on the development plan in patients <6 years of age. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, apart from the Environmental Risk 
Assessment data, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
At the time of the initial Kalydeco (ivacaftor) marketing authorisation application (MAA), the Phase I 
ERA assessment was made based on market data, supported by published epidemiological data and by 
the prevalence adopted by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP). Since ivacaftor can 
now be used as monotherapy and in combination with lumacaftor or tezacaftor, the amount of 
ivacaftor present in the environment has increased. The ERA for ivacaftor has therefore undergone 
revision, with new experimental studies conducted and planned to assess the impact of ivacaftor in the 
environment, as recommended by the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use. An updated ivacaftor ERA (Kalydeco Monotherapy and in combination with 
lumacaftor or tezacaftor Environmental Phase I and II Risk Assessment) will be provided in supportive 
Type II variation for tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination regimen indication. The report will provide a 
revised Fpen based on the prevalence of relevant CFTR mutations that ivacaftor is prescribed for in 
Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symkevi. The Fpen was refined by mutation only and was not restricted by 
age, thereby incorporating the proposed Kalydeco monotherapy indication extension. The Phase II Tier 
B assessments of ivacaftor are on-going and the final ivacaftor ERA will be available in 2019. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable apart 
from the studies of updated ERA. Final ivacaftor ERA will refer to monotherapy medicinal products 
(Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets and Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 mg granules) and to combination 
therapy (Orkambi 100 mg/125 mg film-coated tablets and Orkambi 200 mg/125 mg film-coated 
tablets, Symkevy 100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets) and will be available in 2019. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
There is potential for patients with CF who are 12 to <24 months to benefit from IVA treatment based 
on  evidence  of  unmet  medical  need  and  data  showing  a  favorable  benefit  risk  profile  in  older  patient 
cohorts: 
• 
Evidence of efficacy in subjects ≥6 years of age with a G551D mutation (Studies 102, 103, and 
105) or a non-G551D mutation (Studies 111 and 112); 
•  Comparable effects on PK and sweat chloride (measure of CFTR function) in subjects 2 through 
5 years of age with a CFTR gating mutation (Study 108) and subjects ≥6 years of age;

• 
• 
• 
The well-characterized safety profile in subjects ≥2 years of age; 
Evidence  of  complications  of  CF  starting  very  early  in  life,  including  impaired  pancreatic 
exocrine function, lung inflammation and poor weight gain; and 
Evidence supporting the benefits of early therapeutic intervention. 
In the 12- to <24-month population, the rationale for IVA treatment is supported by the importance of 
slowing  disease  progression  and  the  prevention  of  the  negative  consequences  of  CF  such  as 
compromised lung and pancreatic function and impaired nutritional status, as claimed by the applicant. 
It  is  expected  that  the  primary  benefit  of  IVA  treatment  in  these  younger  CF  subjects  would  derive 
from the potential to reduce the progression of disease before sustaining irreversible damage.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  IVA  in  the  target  age  group  was  investigated  in  Study  124:  An 
ongoing, Phase 3, 2-Part, open-label study in subjects <24 months of age. The study has multiple 
cohorts  and  cohorts  1  and  5,  the  cohorts  that  enrolled  subjects  12  to  <24  months  of  age,  are 
complete.  In each age cohort, safety and PK were evaluated in Part A (4 days of IVA treatment), 
and safety, PK, pharmacodynamics  (PD), and efficacy were evaluated in Part B (24 weeks of  IVA 
treatment).  PK  of  IVA  and  its  metabolites  was  a  primary  objective  of  Part  A  and  a  secondary 
objective for Part B. 
Dose:  IVA  was  supplied  as  granules  packaged  in  a  foil-laminated  sachet/packet  and  was 
administered  orally every 12  hours  (q12h)  at  the  following doses  after  mixing  with  5  mL of  age-
appropriate  soft  food  or  liquid:  50  mg  for  subjects  weighing  7  to  <14  kg;  75  mg  for  subjects 
weighing 14 to <25 kg. At each study visit in Part B, the dose for each subject was adjusted based 
on body weight if necessary. 
Sampling: The PK sampling schedule was as follows: 
Part A       
Day  4:  predose,  between 2  and  4  hours,  between  6  and  8  hours,  and between 
24 to 60 hours after the day 4 morning dosing 
Part B    
Week 2: predose, between 2 and 4 hours, and between 6 and 8 hours after the 
morning dose 
Week 8: predose, 1 hour, and 4 hours after the morning dose 
Week 18: predose and between 2 and 4 hours after the morning dose 
Week 24: predose and between 2 and 4 hours after the morning dose 
Study  population:  From  Study  124  PK  data  was  available  for  Part  A  (7  subjects,  28  PK 
observations)  and  Part  B  Cohort  5  (18  subjects,  108  PK  observations).    Study  124  data  was 
added to a subset of the prior ivacaftor POP-PK data set that was previously constructed. 
Bioanalytics:  Validated  LC/MS/MS  methods  were  applied  to  quantify  ivacaftor  plasma 
concentrations  in  human  plasma  samples.    The  details  are  provided  in  two  separate  reports 
(Bioanalytical Report M315 and Method Validation Report N087). Two major metabolites were 
quantified besides ivacaftor. The stability of the samples was also checked by incurred sample 
reanalysis.  Samples  were  analyzed  by  PPD  Laboratories  (US)  which  operates  in  accordance 
with the GPL principles.   
Results:  Mean  IVA  plasma  concentrations  observed  in  Cohort  1  were  consistent  with  plasma 
concentrations  previously  observed  in  adult  subjects  (Study  102).  The  concentrations  of  IVA, 
M1-IVA, and M6-IVA, by nominal time point are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 below.

Results  from  the  population  PK  model  demonstrate  that  in  subjects  12  to  <24  months 
administered either 50 mg (7 to <14 kg) or 75 mg (14 to <25 kg) IVA granules in Study 124, 
IVA  exposure,  including  both  Cmin  and  AUC,  was  similar  to  that  observed  in  2-  through  5-
year-olds  administered  50  mg  (<14  kg)  or  75  mg  (≥14  kg)  IVA  granules  in  Study  108  and 
adults and adolescents in Phase 3 Studies 102 and 103, see Table 3 and Table 4 below.

Table 4 
Absorption 
Absorption  follows  zero-order  delivery  to  the  absorption  compartment  and  subsequent  first  order 
absorption. Although it was not possible to estimate the bioavailability, F was fixed to a value of 1 and 
random  effects  were  described  to  characterise  the  inter-ocassion  variability.  For  infants  the  SmPC 
recommends that ivacaftor granules should be mixed with 5 mL of age-appropriate soft food or liquid. 
The palatability of the food was checked on day 1 (Part B) and was assessed by the parent/caregiver. 
Regardless of the reaction of the patient (which was negative only in few cases) in all cases the whole 
amount  (5  ml  i.e.  a  teaspoon)  was  administered.  Therefore,  the  granule  formulation  is  palatable  and 
acceptable in the target population. 
Distribution 
The SmPC states that IVA is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA). Given that plasma binding protein levels are 
lower in the newborn than in the adult and gradually increase with age, the MAH was asked to discuss 
the plausibility of an age dependent shift in plasma protein binding (Free/Bound ratio) of ivacaftor and 
its metabolites taking also into account that a decreased plasma protein binding may be due not only 
to the reduction of the total amount of plasma proteins, but also to the diminished binding affinity and 
the high concentrations of endogenous competing substrates. 
In response, it has been clarified that in in vitro experiments using a range of protein concentrations, 
ivacaftor, M1, and M6 were found to be highly protein bound (>99%) independent of the HSA 
concentration. The same was true for IVA and AAG, with IVA being highly protein bound (>97%) 
independent of AAG concentration. In addition, this high levels of protein binging makes it unlikely that 
changes in protein binding affinity or competition from endogenous substrates (such as bilirubin) have 
an impact on the free/bound ratio of IVA.

Elimination 
In adults after 150 mg q12h of the commercial tablet formulation in the fed state, the mean exposure 
(AUCτ metabolite/AUCτ ivacaftor) ratio was approximately 6 for M1 and 2 for M6 (Study 008 from the 
initial submission). The IVA/M1 and IVA/M6 concentration ratios in study 124 are lower, between 2 and 
3. Therefore, the MAH was asked to address this issue. In response, it MAH clarified that the actual M1 
plasma concentrations in Study 008 are only 39 % of the initially reported vales (refer to 
EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0026). Using this factor, the MAH re-estimated the previously reported AUC 
values. Due to the small sample size the results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the 
age-related metabolite difference after the correction disappeared.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Ivacaftor does not inhibit neither induces the metabolic enzymes. When ivacaftor was administered as 
PEG solution formulation in the fasted state, over a single dose range of 25 to 800 mg in healthy male 
subjects, the AUC of ivacaftor from the time of dosing extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞) increased 
proportionally throughout the dose range, and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) increased 
proportionally between 25 and 375 mg, and less than proportionally at doses above 375 mg. 
Special populations 
Although moderate hepatic impairment is relatively rare in children <24 months with CF, such a level 
of  liver  disease  may  occur.  The  recommended  dose  for  patients  12  to  <24  months  with  moderate 
hepatic  impairment  is  the  same  as  recommended  for  older  CF  patients  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment: 
    14 to <25 kg: one 75-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
    7 to <14 kg: one 50-mg sachet/packet of granules qd 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but 
exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The use of IVA 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment is therefore not recommended unless the benefits outweigh 
the risks. In such case, the starting dose should be 1 tablet or 1 sachet/packet of granules qd or less 
frequently. Dosing intervals should be modified according to the clinical response and tolerability. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
There  are  no  new  experimental  data,  but  it  is  known  that  ivacaftor  is  a  sensitive  CYP3A  substrate. 
Medicinal  products  that  modify  CYP3A  activity  may  modify  the  exposure  of  ivacaftor.  Clinical  studies 
showed  that  ivacaftor  is  a  weak  CYP3A  inhibitor  and  is  not  a  CYP2C8  or  CYP2D6  inhibitor.  In  vitro 
studies  suggested  that  ivacaftor  is  not  a  P-gp  substrate  but  a  P-gp  inhibitor.  A  reduction  in  the  IVA 
dose  is  recommended  for  coadministration  with  strong  or  moderate  CYP3A  inhibitors.  The 
recommended IVA dose in patients ≥6 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg is 150 mg twice weekly 
with strong CYP3A inhibitors and 150 mg daily (qd) with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The recommended 
IVA  dose  for  2-  through  5-year-olds  is  50  mg  (<14  kg)  or  75  mg  (≥14  kg)  twice  weekly  during 
concomitant  dosing  with  strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  and  50  mg  (<14  kg)  or  75  mg  (≥14  kg)  qd  during 
concomitant dosing with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ivacaftor  is  a  selective  CFTR  potentiator.  Potentiators  are  pharmacological  agents  that  increase  the 
chloride ion transport properties of the channel in the presence of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase 
A (PKA) activation. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Loss  of  CFTR  function  in  the  sweat  gland  leads  to  an  elevation  in  chloride  concentration.  In  the 
epithelia  of  the  lungs  and  pancreas,  CFTR  dysfunction  causes  aberrant  ion  and  water  movement 
leading to obstruction and eventual destruction of both organ systems. In the Phase 3 trials of IVA in 
subjects  2  through  5  and  ≥6  years  of  age  with  CF,  results  showed  that  treatment  with  IVA  improved 
CFTR function, as evidenced by improvements in sweat chloride levels. The pancreas is of the earliest 
and most seriously affected organs in patients with  CF. Faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) and immunoreactive 
trypsin  and/or  trypsinogen  (IRT)  are  two  additional  diagnostic  measures  which  can  be  used  to  follow 
the  effect  effect  of  treatment  although  the  interpretation  of  the  results  of  IRT  in  the  absence  of  a 
control  group  is  difficult.  Sweat  chloride  levels,  FE-1  and  IRT  were  measured  in  Study  124  to  follow 
ivacaftor  action  in  the  12-24-month-old  patient  group.  All  these  parameters  showed  an  improvement 
after 24 weeks of IVA treatment. Further details are provided in the efficacy section. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A population PK model was used to evaluate IVA disposition in subjects 12 to <24 months from Study 
124  (Part  A/Cohort 1  and Part  B/Cohort  5)  and  in  subjects  ≥2  years  of  age  from  an  existing  dataset 
that  includes  Studies  102,  103,  104,  108,  110,  and  111.  Consistent  with  previous  iterations  of  the 
model,  IVA  PK  was  described  by  a  2-compartment  model  with  zero-order  delivery  to  the  absorption 
compartment  and  subsequent  first-order  absorption.  Goodness-of-fit  criteria  revealed  that  the  final 
model was consistent with observed data and that no systematic bias remained when stratified by age 
groups down to 12 months of age. Allometric relationships were incorporated in the base model for all 
structural  parameters  to  describe  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  IVA  PK.  Although  maturation  models 
were  explored,  none  of  these  models  demonstrated  improved  fit  when  compared  to  the  reduced 
allometric  weight  model.  Additionally,  population  PK  simulations  that  did  not  account  for  maturation 
effects  demonstrated  that  subjects  12  to  <24  months  of  age  had  similar  exposure  (AUCss)  to  older 
children administered 50-mg (<14 kg) or 75-mg doses (≥14 kg) q12h, and adult subjects administered 
150  mg  q12h.  These  results  suggest  that  changes  in  IVA  disposition  due  to  maturation  of  clearance 
processes in children 12 to <24 months of age are minimal. However, due to the small sample size this 
point should be further assessed when new data from younger infants are available. 
Data 
lvacaftor population PK in adults and paediatric subjects as young as two years old has been previously 
characterized in several analyses. The objectives of the population PK analysis were to characterize the 
PK of IVA in subjects with CF 12 to <24 months of age and to compare exposures to those previously 
obtained in older subjects. To achieve this goal data of Part A/Cohort 1 and Part B/Cohort 5 of Study 
124,  were  integrated  with  an  existing  dataset  of  Phase  3  studies  conducted  in  subjects  with  CF, 
including paediatric subjects ≥2 to 18 years of age. The ivacaftor PK data set comprised 197 patients 
contributing  a  total  of  1797  plasma  concentrations,  dosing  and  covariate  data.  The  study  population 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018

consisted  of  106  males  and  91  females  with  ages  ranging  from  6  months  to  18  years  and  weights 
ranging from 6.70 to 87.0 kg, see Table 5 below. 
Table 5 Summary of Continuous Covariates (POP-PK data set) 
Method 
Population  PK  analysis  for  repeated-measures  endpoints  was  conducted  via  nonlinear  mixed  effects 
modelling with NONMEM (Version 7). The previously developed population PK model was used as the 
starting point for model fitting, which consisted of a two-compartment model with sequential zero and 
first  order  absorption  and  allometric  scaling  describe  body  size  effects  on  ivacaftor.  To  investigate 
maturational  effects  on  ivacaftor  clearance,  a  model  to  describe  the  effects  or  age  on  clearance  was 
also  investigated.  Model  selection  was  guided  by  various  goodness-of-fit  criteria,  including  diagnostic 
scatter  plots,  convergence  with  at  least  2  significant  digits,  plausibility  of  parameter  estimates, 
precision of parameter estimates, correlation between model parameter estimation errors < 0.95, and 
the  AIC,  given  the  minimum  objective  function  value  and  number  of  estimated  parameters.  The  final 
population PK model was evaluated using a prediction-corrected visual predictive check (VPC). 
Model 
Consistent with the previous population PK model, IVA PK was described by a 2-compartment model 
with zero-order delivery to the absorption compartment and subsequent first-order absorption (Report 
N364). Allometric relationships using body weight were incorporated in the base model for all 
structural parameters to describe the effect of body size on IVA PK. 
This  model  was  further  refined  by  testing  different  structural  models  and  random  effects  models.  To 
investigate maturational effects on ivacaftor clearance the following model was evaluated:  
FMAT  is  the  fractional  maturation  of  ivacaftor  clearance,  PMA  is  post  menstrual  age,  TM50  is  the 
maturation half-time, and Hill is the Hill coefficient.  
Once a final model was obtained, the same population PK model was fit to a subset of the data that did 
not  include  Study  124  subjects,  to  provide  a  simulation  model  that  eliminated  the  impact  of  any 
maturation  effects  from  these  subjects.  Five  hundred  subjects  with  body  weights  randomly  sampled 
were  simulated  for  each  age  group  (up  to  6  months,  7-12  months,  13-18  months,  19-24  months). 
Distributions  of  AUCss  for  each  group,  and  also  re-stratified  by  weight  and  dosing  groups  were 
compared to the individual predicted values for Study 124. 
Results  
The  typical  estimates  of  PK  model  parameters  for  the  reference  weight  of  70  kg  were  21.4  L/h  for 
CL/F, 75.6 L for Vc/F, 76.5 L for Vp/F, 11.3 L/h for Q/F, 2.78 h for D1 and 0.160 h-1 for ka. Parameter 
estimates were relatively precise and were consistent with previously reported PK parameters for IVA. 
In prior population PK analyses, body weight was the most significant predictor of IVA disposition and 
other  covariates  (race,  gender,  and  patient  status  [CF  versus  healthy  subject])  did  not  explain  a 
significant  portion  of  the  intersubject  variability.  After  accounting  for  body  weight,  possible

maturational changes were explored for the 12- to <24-month-old subjects in Study 124. Plots of CL/F 
and Vc/F random effects showed no obvious trends with age that would indicate dispositional changes 
due  to  naturation.  A  two  compartment  model  with  allometric  body  weight  provided  an  adequate 
description confirmed standard model checking methods, see Figure 1 below.

The parameter estimates are provided in the following Table 6:

Although the evaluation of the observations did not show any maturation effect (see Figure 2 below), 
an asymptotic maturation model was explored with both estimated and fixed parameters, but none of 
these models improved model fit. All tested models increased the objective function value with respect 
to the simplest model. The results of the pcVPC indicate that the model reasonably fit the data in one 
to two year old subjects.

Although  results  from  this  figure  seem  to  indicate  that  no  maturation  effect  affects  clearance,  results 
from the simulated subjects for each age group, do not completely exclude the maturation effect. The 
predicted  AUCss  and  Cminss  show  a  clear  age  dependent  exposure  increase  in  the  1  –  11-year  age 
interval, as depicted in Table 7 below.  
Table 7 Predicted IVA Exposure in Subjects with CF by Age (younger than 18-year-old) 
The predicted concentrations for the 12-24-month-old are similar to what was measured for adults. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of ivacaftor in the target age group was investigated in Study 124. Study 124 was divided into 
initial part (part A) and maintenance part (Part B).  PK data was available from both parts, from Part A 
{7 subjects, 28 PK observations) and from Part B Cohort 5 (18 subjects, 108 PK observations) as well.  
To  carry  out  POP-PK  analysis,  the  data  from  Study  124  data  was  added  to  a  previously  constructed 
POP-PK  database.    Therefore,  with  the  results  from  the  previous  studies,  plasma  concentrations  data 
from  31  subjects  were  available  in  the  12-24-month  age  group.  Consistent  with  the  previous 
population PK model, IVA PK was described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order delivery to the 
absorption  compartment  and  subsequent  first-order  absorption.  Algometric  relationships  using  body 
weight were incorporated in the base model for all structural parameters to describe the effect of body 
size  on  ivacaftor  PK.  Model  fit  was  not  improved  by  incorporating  maturational  models.  The  results 
suggest that the maturation has no effect on the ivacaftor clearance. However, this needs to be further 
assessed  when  data  from  younger  infants  from  study  124  become  available.  The  observed  and  POP- 
PK predicted concentrations in the 12 to <24 age group was very similar what was observed in adults.  
Thus, the suggested dose recommendation is supported by the kinetic data.    
However,  there  were  some  points  which  had  to  be  clarified.  In  adults  after  150  mg  q12h  of  the 
commercial  tablet  formulation  in  the  fed  state,  the  mean  exposure  (AUCτ  metabolite/AUCτ  ivacaftor) 
ratio was approximately 6 for M1 and 2 for  M6 (Study 008 from the initial submission).  The  IVA/M1 
and IVA/M6 concentration ratios were lower, between 2 and 3  in study 124.  Thus it seemed that the 
parent  compound/metabolite  concentration  ratios  in  infants  are  different  from  what  was  observed  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 19/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adults.  It was clarified that due to a bioanalytical error the metabolite concentration data in the initial 
MAA are incorrect.  The MAH estimated that the actual M1 plasma concentrations in Study 008 are only 
39%  of  the  initially  reported  vales.  Using  this  factor,  the  MAH  re-estimated  the  previously  reported 
AUC values. Due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, 
the age-related metabolite difference after the correction disappeared. 
Different metabolism rate is only one of the factors which should be considered when PK processes 
between infants and adults are compared. Plasma binding protein levels are lower in the new-born 
than in the adult and gradually increase with age. At birth, human serum albumin (HSA) 
concentrations are close to adult levels (75%-80%), while alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) is initially 
half the adult concentration. The SmPC states that IVA is approximately 99% bound to plasma 
proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and HSA.  This warranted further discussion about the 
possibility of altered plasma protein binding of ivacaftor and its metabolites in infants. In response to 
the CHMP’s question, it has been clarified that in in vitro experiments using a range of HAS 
concentrations, ivacaftor and metabolites M1 and M6 were found to be highly protein bound (>99%) 
independent of the HSA concentration. The same was true for IVA and AAG, with IVA being highly 
protein bound (>97%) independent of AAG concentration. In addition, these high levels of protein 
binging make it unlikely that changes in protein binding affinity or competition from endogenous 
substrates (such as bilirubin) have an impact on the free/bound ratio of IVA.  
Overall,  the  exposure  is  steadily  increasing  starting  from  age  1  up  to  age  12.    The  essential  concern 
was  not  the  safety  of  the  patients,  but  rather  an  unknown,  unexplained  factor  which  has  significant 
impact  on  the  exposure  in  infants  and  children.    This  unknown  age  dependent  factor  was  not  well 
captured  by  the  POP-PK  model  and  quite  apparent  for  1-12-year-old  patients.    A  POP-PK  model  is 
considered only partially validated if a random component shows dependence on a covariate. The MAH 
agreed  that  an  unexplainable  negative  trend  can  be  observed  between  Cl  component  and  age.  The 
reason remained unknown but currently considered as an unresolved methodological problem without 
clinical implications. 
Hence,  the  SmPC,  section  5.2,  was  adequately  updated  with  the  following  PK  data  in  this  extended 
indication: 
Mean (SD) ivacaftor exposure by age group 
Age group

24 months 
(7 kg to <14 kg)

The population approach is considered useful to extrapolate and analyse the available data including 
PD data. Serial sweat chloride measurements can be used to follow the effects of therapies directly 
affecting CFTR function. The sweat chloride response is influenced by several factors such as   age 
gender, testing variability, recording biases, and the CFTR genotype itself. Previously the MAH 
developed POP-PK/PD models to characterize the effect between plasma concentration and FEV1.  It is 
problematic to measure FEV1 under a certain young age. Therefore, the MAH was encouraged to 
develop a simple PK/PD model which makes connection between the POP-PK estimated AUC and the 
sweat chloride response parameters (EC50, Emax and T50 the time when EC50 is achieved).  
However, due to the sparsity of sweat chloride data in this study, there was insufficient information to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 20/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
develop a linear or nonlinear exposure-response model. Instead, the MAH provided graphical analysis 
using the data of 10 children between age 1 and 2 years with sweat chloride values at baseline and at 
week 24. The plots did not reveal any trends between AUC and sweat chloride but this might be due to 
the small sample size (n=10) and high variability. The MAH focused on data in the 12 - 24-month age 
group but including data of older children would have been very useful.   
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The recommended dose of IVA granules for patients 12 to <24 months is 50 mg for patients weighing 
7  to  <14  kg  and  75  mg  for  patients  weighing  14  to  <25  kg,  administered  q12h  with  fat-  containing 
food. This dose recommendation is supported by the measured plasma values in the 1-2-year-old age 
group  and  by  the  updated  POP-PK  model.  Nevertheless,  some  observations  pointed  to  the  direction 
that  the  PK  results  obtained  in  adults  cannot  be  fully  extrapolated  to  children  and  infants.    In  the 
response  the  MAH  clarified  that  plasma  protein  concentrations  indeed  might  be  lower  than  in  older 
children  but  still in  the  normal  range.  However,  there  is  no  difference  between  the  metabolite  ratios, 
the reported difference was due to an already reported analytical error. Graphical analysis revealed no 
relationship between ivacaftor exposure and sweat chloride response. The observed trend between age 
and  Cl  remained  unexplained  but  currently  not  considered  clinically  relevant  problem.  The  updated 
wording of the SmPC is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data presented for this current extension of indication is based on an interim analysis for 
Study  124,  reporting  data  from  subjects  12  to  <24  months  of  age  who  completed  Part  A/Cohort  1 
and/or Part B/Cohort 5 (through 24 weeks of IVA treatment). 
Study  124  is  an  ongoing,  Phase  3,  2-part,  open-label  study  in  subjects  <24  months  with  1  of  the 
following  mutations  on  at  least  1  CFTR  allele:  G551D,  G178R,  S549N,  S549R,  G551S,  G1244E, 
S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D. Patients with an R117H mutation are eligible to enrol in regions where 
IVA is approved for use in patients 2 through 5 years of age with an R117H mutation. 
Given  the  underlying  pathophysiology  of  CF  and  as  outlined  in  the  ICH  guideline  E11  (Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population), efficacy in subjects 12 to <24 months 
of  age  can  also  be  extrapolated  from  data  from  older  populations  of  subjects.  Results  from  placebo-
controlled Phase 3 studies in subjects with CF ≥6 years of age who had the G551D mutation (Studies 
102  and  103)  or  a  non-G551D  gating  mutation  (Study  111)  showed  that  IVA  is  effective  in  the 
treatment  of  subjects  with  CF,  as  evidenced  by  sustained  improvements  in  CFTR  channel  function 
(measured  by  reduction  in  sweat  chloride  concentration)  and  corresponding  substantial  and  durable 
improvements in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and weight gain. 
The  safety,  PK,  PD  and  efficacy  of  IVA  treatment  in  subjects  2  through  5  years  of  age  with  a  gating 
mutation  was  evaluated  in  open-label  Study  108.  Results  of  Study  108  demonstrated  the  safety  and 
PK  of  IVA  treatment  in  subjects  2  through  5  years  of  age.  Furthermore,  results  from  Study  108 
demonstrated  that  IVA  improved  CFTR  function  in  subjects  2  through  5  years  of  age,  with 
corresponding positive effects on pancreatic function, and nutritional status. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-response study has been performed; however, selection of doses for Part A and Part B 
in Study 124 was supported by simulation exercise. Dosing regimen for 1-2 years olds is based on 
simulations performed to predict ivacaftor exposure in three weight groups of patients aged less than 2

years: 4.5 to <7 kg, 7 to <14 kg, and 14 to <25 kg. Previously developed population PK model was 
used, that included data from subjects 2 - 5 years of age. The same Cmin and AUC values were 
targeted as in adults. The simulations also incorporated a maturation function to determine the range 
of likely exposures given maturational changes in clearance. Based on results of these simulations, a 
lower weight bound of 5 kg was determined to be more appropriate for subjects receiving the 25-mg 
dose to maintain exposures within the targeted range. This approach was agreed by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study 124: A Phase 3, 2-Part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, 
and Pharmacodynamics of Ivacaftor in Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis Who Are Less Than 24 
Months of Age at Treatment Initiation and Have a CFTR Gating Mutation 
Methods 
This is an ongoing Phase 3, 2-part, open-label study of orally administered IVA in subjects with CF who 
were  <24  months  of  age  at  treatment  initiation  (Day  1)  and  have  a  CFTR  gating  mutation  or  R117H 
(currently  in  the  US  only)  on  at  least  1  allele.  Part  A  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  PK  of 
multiple-dose administration of IVA over 4 days of dosing, and to confirm (or adjust if necessary) the 
doses  for  Part  B.  Part  B  was  designed to evaluate  the  safety,  PK,  PD,  and  efficacy  of  IVA  in  subjects 
over 24 weeks. Subjects 12 to <24 months of age were enrolled in Cohort 1 of Part A and Cohort 5 of 
Part  B.  Younger  subjects  are  enrolled  in  subsequent  descending  age  cohorts  following  PK  and  safety 
assessments for each age cohort: 
• Cohort 1: subjects aged 12 to <24 months 
• Cohort 3: subjects aged 3 to <6 months 
• Cohort 2: subjects aged 6 to <12 months 
• Cohort 4: subjects aged 0 to <3 months 
Subjects will be enrolled in Part B sequentially in the following cohorts based on age at Day 1 of Part 
B: 
• Cohort 5: subjects aged 12 to <24 months 
• Cohort 6: subjects aged 6 to <12 months 
• Cohort 7: subjects aged 0 to <6 months

During the treatment periods of Parts A and B, 25 mg (for subjects 5 to <7 kg on Day 1), 50 mg (for 
subjects  7  to  <14  kg  on  Day  1),  or  75  mg  (for  subjects  ≥14  to  <25  kg  on  Day  1)  IVA  was  to  be 
administered  every  12  hours  (q12h).  Part  A  consisted  of  a  Screening  Period  (Day  -28  to  Day  -1),  a 
Treatment  Period  (Day  1  to  Day  5),  a  Follow-up  Telephone  Call  (Day  14),  and  a  Follow-up 
Ophthalmologic Examination (OE, 8 weeks after the last dose). Part B consisted of a Screening Period 
(Day -28 to Day -1), a Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 24), a Follow-up Visit (4 weeks after the last 
dose),  and  a  Follow-up  OE  (24  weeks  after  the  last  dose).  Subjects  who  completed  24  weeks  of  IVA 
treatment were eligible to enroll in the open-label treatment arm of an Extension Study, Study VX15-
770-126. This interim analysis includes all data from subjects 12 to <24 months of age who completed 
Cohort 1/Part A and/or Cohort 5/Part B (through 24 weeks of treatment), see Figure 3 below.

• 
For Cohorts 4 and 7 only, gestational age ≥38 weeks. 
•  Weight at screening within the weight limits as defined for the study drug dose levels 
Key exclusion criteria 
•  History  of  any  illness  or  condition  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  might  have 
confounded the results of the study or posed an additional risk in administering study drug to 
the subject 
•  An  acute  upper  or  lower  respiratory  infection,  or  PEx,  or  changes  in  therapy  (including 
antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 4 weeks before Day 1 
•  Colonization  with  organisms  associated  with  a  more  rapid  decline  in  pulmonary  status  (e.g., 
Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and Mycobacterium abscessus) at screening.  
•  Abnormal  liver  function  at  screening  or  any  prior  history  of  clinically  relevant  elevated  (>2  × 
upper  limit  of  normal  [ULN])  serum  aspartate  transaminase  (AST),  serum  alanine 
transaminase (ALT), or bilirubin (excluding newborn hyperbilirubinemia) 
•  Any  clinically  significant  "non-CF-related"  illness  within  2  weeks  before  Day  1.  "Illness"  was 
defined as an acute (serious or nonserious) condition (e.g., gastroenteritis) 
•  Use of any moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A within 2 weeks before Day 1 
• 
Presence  of  a  lens  opacity  or  cataract  identified  at  the  screening  OE  (excluding  those 
considered congenital and nonprogressive, such as a suture cataract) 
In  CHMP’s  view,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  appropriate  and  in  line  with  previous  studies 
conducted  with  ivacaftor  in  children.  Criteria  did  not  include  spirometry  limits.  This  is  agreed  as 
spirometry  usually  cannot  be  performed  in  children  aged  less  than  6  years  old,  due  to  compliance 
issues.  
Treatments 
For Cohorts 1 and 5, IVA granules were administered orally at a dosage of 50 or 75 mg q12h based on 
their weight. In Part A, doses administered from the evening dose on Day 1 through the evening dose 
on Day 3 were administered q12h at home, and the Day 1 and Day 4 morning dose was administered 
in the clinic. On Day 1 of Part B, subjects received a single dose of 50 mg or 75 mg IVA (by weight) in 
the clinic. At each study visit, the IVA dose for each subject was reassessed based on body weight and 
adjusted  if  necessary.  For  Cohort  5,  all  subjects  received  50  mg  IVA  based  on  their  weight  for  the 
duration of the 24-week treatment period, with the exception of 1 subject who received 75 mg IVA at 
the  Week  24  Visit.  Each  dose  of  granules  was  mixed  with  approximately  1  teaspoon  (5  mL)  of 
appropriate liquid or soft food and administered with an age-appropriate fat-containing meal or snack.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Assessment of the safety of IVA treatment in subjects with CF who are less than 2 years of age and 
have a CFTR gating mutation was a primary objective of Parts A and B. 
PK endpoints: refer to PK section of this report. 
Primary safety endpoints:  AEs, clinical laboratory values (haematology and serum chemistry), OEs, 
physical examinations, standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs 
Pharmacodynamic endpoint: sweat chloride test 
Tertiary efficacy endpoints: Absolute change from baseline for weight, length, weight-for-length, 
weight-for-age z-score, length-for-age z-score, weight-for-length-for-age z-score, lung clearance index 
(LCI) at qualified study sites (based on mass spectrometry analysis), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 
seconds, forced mid-expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, and functional residual capacity at 
qualified study sites, FE-1, IRT, markers of intestinal inflammation (calprotectin), qualitative 
microbiology cultures; pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CF-related hospitalizations, 
acceptability/palatability. 
Sample size 
A minimum of 5 subjects were planned to enrol in each of the cohorts for Parts A and B. In this interim 
analysis, the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Safety Set included: 
• 
• 
Part A: 7 subjects who enrolled in Cohort 1 and received at least 1 dose of IVA 
Part B: 19 subjects who enrolled in Cohort 5 and received at least 1 dose of IVA 
Randomisation 
This was a single-treatment-arm study.

Statistical methods 
Study  124  is  still  ongoing  study.    The  sample  size  of  a  minimum  of  20  subjects  in  Part  A  and  15 
subjects  in  Part  B  was  based  on  the  availability  of  the  subject  population  and  PK  analysis 
considerations,  and  not  on  statistical  consideration.  Therefore,  the  study  is  not  powered  to  detect  a 
significant  treatment  effect.  Continuous  variables  and  categorical  variables  were  summarized  by 
standard  descriptive  statistics.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  applied  descriptive  methods  were 
adequate for the limited study goals set in protocol.  
Results 
Participant flow 
PART A: A total of 7 subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set. All 7 subjects completed 4 
days of treatment. 
PART B: A total of 19 subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set. One subject participated 
in Part A and in Part B. Eighteen subjects (94.7%) completed the 24 weeks of treatment. One subject 
prematurely discontinued study drug treatment due to physician decision (due to difficulty in drawing 
blood), and consent was subsequently withdrawn. 
Seventeen  subjects  rolled  over  into  Study  126  and  therefore  did  not  have  the  Follow-up  Visit,  per 
protocol.  One  subject  reached  the  age  of  2  years  and  initiated  treatment  with  commercial  IVA  after 
completing the 24-week treatment period. 
Recruitment 
Subjects from Cohort 1 were enrolled at 7 sites in Australia, the UK, and the US. Subjects from Cohort 
5 were enrolled at 13 sites in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US. 
Conduct of the study 
Study initiation: 25 August 2016 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form for Part 
A) 
End of Interim Analysis: 01 November 2017 (date last subject from Cohort 5 completed Part B Week 
24 Visit) 
Study completion: Study is ongoing for subjects <12 months of age 
Amendments: 
The protocol was amended twice but neither change can be considered compromise appropriate study 
conduct.  Overall,  the  mean  study  drug  compliance  was  98.3%,  and  100%  of  subjects  were  ≥80% 
compliant with study drug.

Baseline data 
PART A   
Demographics: The mean age of the 5 subjects in the 50-mg group was 18 months (range: 14 to 23 
months). In the 75-mg group, the 2 subjects were aged 21 and 23 months. The number of male and 
female  subjects  was  similar  in  the  50-mg  group;  both  subjects  in  the  75-mg  group  were  male.  All 
subjects were White and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. All subjects had a G551D mutation, with 
the  exception  of  1  subject  who  had  a  G551S  mutation.  Overall,  the  most  prevalent  genotype  was 
G551D/F508del (4/7). 
Baseline  characteristics:  In  general,  weight,  length,  weight-for-length,  and  BMI  values  were  similar 
among  subjects  within  each  dose  group  and,  as  expected  from  the  weight-based  dosing,  generally 
greater in the 75-mg group than in the 50-mg group, see Table 8 below. 
Table 8 
Prior  and  concomitant  medications:  In  general,  concomitant  medication  use  was  typical  of  a  CF 
population.  The  most  commonly  reported  concomitant  medications  were  salbutamol,  pancreatin, 
dornase alfa, and sodium chloride, which were taken by over 50% of subjects overall. 
PART B 
Demographics: All subjects weighed <14 kg (range: 7.5 to 12.4 kg) and therefore received IVA 50 mg 
q12h. The number of male and female subjects was similar. All subjects were White and the majority

were  of  non-Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity.  The  majority  (16/19)  of  subjects  had  a  G551D  mutation;  2 
subjects  had  a  S549N  mutation;  and  1  subject  had a  G178R  mutation.  The  most  prevalent  genotype 
was G551D/F508del (11/19).

Sweat chloride values were available only for 14 children at baseline. The mean (SD) sweat chloride 
value was 104.1 (12.8) mmol/l with a minimum value of 72.0 mmol/l. Of the 19 subjects in Cohort 5, 
11 were considered to be pancreatic insufficient at baseline (based on a level of faecal elastase-1 [FE-
1] values <200 μg/g) and 8 were considered pancreatic sufficient. Mean (SD) FE-1 values at baseline 
were 13.4 (12.3) μg/g for pancreatic insufficient subjects and 414.4 (120.9) μg/g for pancreatic 
sufficient subjects. Mean (SD) immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) values at baseline were 1122.2 
(211.6) ng/mL for pancreatic insufficient subjects and 1200.0 (0.0) ng/mL for subjects who were 
pancreatic sufficient (upper limit of quantification of the assay was 1200 ng/ml). 
Upon CHMP request the MAH provided baseline weight-, length-, and weight-for-length z-scores and 
percentiles by sex. These are summarised in Table 10 below.

Medical history: the most frequent disease manifestation in these young children was lung disease 
followed by pancreatic failure and constipation.  
Prior  and  concomitant  medication:  The  most  commonly  reported  concomitant  medications  were 
pancreatin,  paracetamol,  salbutamol,  sodium  chloride,  dornase  alfa,  and  pancrelipase,  which  were 
taken by over 30% of subjects.

The waterfall plot of change from baseline at week 24 in sweat chloride is presented in Figure 5 below. 
Figure 5 
In  Part  B,  all  subjects  in  Cohort  5  had  very  high  sweat  chloride  values  (around  100  mmol/L),  as  all 
subjects harboured gating (majority G551D) mutations which result generally in severe phenotype of 
CF. Following 2 weeks of treatment a robust decrease in sweat chloride was apparent (mean decrease 
60  mmol/L),  some  patients  must  have  had  normal  Cl  values  (suggested  by  minimum  values).  This 
robust improvement increased further on through week 24 visit.  
The  pre-specified  analysis  of  sweat  chloride  as  described  in  the  protocol  and  the  statistical  analysis 
plan (SAP) was the mean absolute change at Week 24 from baseline in Part B only. No such analysis 
was planned for children in Part A and therefore these are not available. 
Overall, the analysis of change from baseline in sweat chloride was conducted as pre-specified in the 
protocol  and  SAP.  As  a  drawback  of  the  present  analysis,  data  at  baseline  and  at  week  24  are  only 
available  for  10  children  (based  on  the  waterfall  plot  provided).  The  descriptive  analysis  includes  14 
subjects at baseline and 14 at week 24 (that are not the same subjects as otherwise the waterfall plot 
should  have  included  data  for  14  children).  The  MAH  was  asked  to  clarify  the  reason  behind  the 
decreased  number  of  subjects  in the  analysis.  In  their  response,  it  was  stated  that  nineteen  subjects 
were enrolled in part B of study 124. Out of these 19 subjects, 18 completed the 24 week treatment 
period.  However,  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  show  that  for  many  of  these  children  efficacy 
outcomes that allow calculating the change from baseline were not available. In this respect, for sweat 
chloride  data  at  baseline  and  at  week  24  were  only  available  for  10  patients.  The  results  quoted  in 
section 5.1 of SmPC correspond to the change in sweat chloride observed for these 10 patients, which 
is agreeable.

Table 14 
Small children with CF generally have  normal lung function, as despite recurrent infections and small 
structural changes, lung compensates for a relatively long time. A more prominent sign of CF may be 
malnourishment  (if  any)  in  these  children.  However,  growth  parameters  were  normal  or  near-normal 
at baseline for most children enrolled in Cohort 5, part B of study 124. Pancreatic insufficient patients 
received enzyme-replacement therapy at baseline and during this study. Through week 24, all growth 
parameter increased. Considering that this population is normally a rapidly growing one, the MAH was 
requested to compare the change from baseline through week 24 in weight, length, BMI and respective 
z-scores  of  study  subjects  to  historical  values  in  those  who  were  not  treated  with  ivacaftor  and  had 
gating  mutation  at  least  on  one  allele  and  were  at  the  same  age.  In  addition,  the  MAH  was  also 
requested to provide the following:  
- Descriptive statistics of change from baseline in weight-, length-, and weight-for-length z-scores by 
sex (part B) based on subjects with available data as well as restricted to subjects with both baseline 
and week 24 data available. 
-  Descriptive  statistics  of  change  from  baseline  in  weight-for-age  z-score  restricted  to  subjects  with 
weight-for-age  z-scores  below  0  (part  B).  The  percentage  of  children  who  reach  after  24  weeks  a  z-
score equal or above 0 should be provided (by sex).  
The requested comparison versus an age-matched historical cohort of children who were not treated 
with ivacaftor and had gating mutation in at least one allele was not provided. Instead, the MAH stated 
that patients with Class I to III CF mutations, including gating mutations, who were <2 years of age 
had a median weight percentile of 44.3, a median length percentile of 29.2, and a median weight-for-
length percentile of 63.5 based on the 2016 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry Annual 
Data Report. At study 124 baseline, children enrolled in Cohort 5, part B had a mean weight-for-age 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 35/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentile of 60.3, a mean length-for-age percentile of 39.8 and a mean weight-for-length percentile of 
68.2 The mean (95% CI) change from baseline at week 24 in the above measures was 4.5 (-2.4, 
11.4), 11.1 (2.1, 20.0), and 1.5 (-7.3, 10.3) respectively for the overall population of Cohort 5.   
Regarding the requested data of change from baseline in weight-, length-, and weight-for-length Z-
scores by sex, these are summarised in Table 15 below.  
Table 15 
Of the 6 subjects who had weight z-scores less than 0 at baseline, 3 (50%) had a z-score ≥0 after 24 
weeks of treatment with IVA (1 of 3 males and 2 of 3 females). Overall, 14 of 19 (73.7%) subjects had 
a z-score ≥0 after 24 weeks of treatment with IVA. The mean (SD) change in weight-for-age Z-score 
from baseline to week 24 restricted to children with a weight-for-age Z-score below 0 at baseline was 
0.12 (0.18) for boys and 0.51 (0.55) for girls.  
When the results by sex are compared to those of the overall population it would appear that the 
change in weight-for-age z-score is driven by that observed in girls (0.22 vs. 0.10) while in the case of 
length-for-age z-score, boys experienced a change of 0.38 vs. 0.17 in girls. Regarding weight-for-
length z-score, the change experienced by boys was -0.06 vs. 0.21 in girls. The MAH is of the opinion 
that there is no clinical rationale for the discrepancy in growth parameters by sex and the results 
observed are an artefact of the small sample size and high variability in ages within the cohort. This 
could lead to false assumptions and the potential for different treatment decisions between sexes, thus 
proposed to retain only the ‘all patient’ data in the label. In this respect, the results quoted in section 
5.1, as agreed by the CHMP, are as follows:  
For patients with both baseline and Week 24 values available, mean (SD) weight for age z score at 
baseline was 0.32 (0.76), with a mean (SD) absolute change of 0.15 (0.42) at 24 weeks; mean (SD) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 36/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
length for age z score at baseline was -0.24 (0.83), with a mean (SD) absolute change of 0.28 (0.60) 
at 24 weeks; and mean (SD) weight for length z score at baseline was 0.62 (0.94), with a mean (SD) 
absolute change of 0.07 (0.65) at 24 weeks. 
Pancreatic function and inflammation 
Faecal elastase 
Increases  in  mean  FE-1  were  observed  by  Week  2  and  sustained  through  Week  24,  suggesting 
improvement  in  pancreatic  function  with  IVA  treatment  (Figure  6  below).  Mean  FE-1  at  Week  24 
(326.9  μg/g)  was  nearly  double that  at  baseline  (182.2  μg/g).  The  mean  (SD)  absolute  change  from 
baseline was 29.4 (109.7) μg/g at Week 2 and 164.7 (151.9) μg/g at Week 24. 
Subjects  with  CF  that  have  FE-1  levels  <200  μg/g  are  considered  pancreatic  insufficient.  Of  the  19 
subjects in part B, cohort 5, 11 were considered to be pancreatic insufficient. Mean (SD) FE-1 values at 
baseline  were  13.4  (12.3)  µg/g  for  pancreatic  insufficient  subjects  and  414.4  (120.9)  µg/g  for 
pancreatic  sufficient  subjects.    Nine  subjects  with  pancreatic  insufficiency  had  values  of  FE-1  at  both 
baseline  and  week  24.  The  mean  (SD)  change  from  baseline  was  248.1  µg/g  (132.9).  These  are  the 
results  quoted  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  Six  of  these  9  subjects  were  pancreatic  insufficient  at 
baseline  (FE-1  <200  μg/g)  and  had  FE-1  >200  μg/g  at  Week  24,  indicative of  pancreatic  sufficiency. 
No subject who was pancreatic sufficient at baseline became pancreatic insufficient after 24 weeks of 
treatment.  Although  these  results  are  supportive,  data  beyond  24  weeks  are  needed  to  conclude 
whether this effect is kept in the long term.

Immunoreactive trypsinogen 
There  was  a  rapid  decrease  in  mean  IRT  from  baseline  by  Week  2  that  was  sustained  through  Week 
24, suggesting a decrease in pancreatic inflammation. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline 
was -444.1 (363.6) ng/mL at Week 2 and -647.1 (339.3) ng/mL at Week 24. 
As  previously  stated,  out  of  the  19  subjects  in  Cohort  5;  11  were  considered  to  be  pancreatic 
insufficient at baseline and 8 were considered pancreatic sufficient. Mean (SD) IRT values at baseline 
were  1122.2  (211.6)  ng/mL  for  pancreatic  insufficient  subjects  and  1200.0  (0.0)  ng/mL  for  subjects 
who  were  pancreatic  sufficient.  All  8  pancreatic  sufficient  subjects  had  a  value  of  1200  ng/mL  at 
baseline,  which  was  the  upper  limit  of  quantification  for  this  assay.  The  mean  (SD)  change  from 
baseline  at  week  24  in  IRT  limited  to  subjects  with  pancreatic  insufficiency  who  had  values  at  both 
points in time was -533.1 (394.5) ng/ ml (n=10).  
While improvements in IRT are not numerically comparable to results from prior studies due to the 
change in assay, the MAH states that the rapid and large improvement from baseline are clear and 
directionally consistent across IVA studies. However, data on IRT are difficult to interpret in the 
absence of a control group. As for FE-1, data beyond of 24 weeks are also needed.  
Lipase, amylase 
Part A/Cohort 1: Lipase and amylase levels showed a rapid decline after the start of IVA treatment in 
Part A. The mean lipase level was 125.7 U/L (normal range: 4 to 31 U/L) at baseline and decreased to 
67.57 U/L at Day 5. The mean amylase level was 61.6 U/L baseline (normal range: 7 to 79 U/L) and 
decreased to 49.6 U/L at Day 5. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Day 5 was -58.14 
(58.35) U/L for lipase and -12.0 (16.4) U/L for amylase. 
Part B/Cohort 5: Rapid reductions in both lipase and amylase levels that persisted over the 24 weeks 
of IVA treatment were observed. Mean lipase was elevated at 285.26 U/L (normal range: 4 to 31 U/L) 
at  baseline,  and  decreased  to  67.44  U/L  at  Week  24.  Mean  amylase  was  also  elevated  at  102.2  U/L 
(normal  range:  8  to  79  U/L)  and  decreased  to  49.8  U/L  at  Week  24.  All  subjects  with  elevations  in 
lipase  and/or  amylase  at  baseline  were  asymptomatic.  Mean  (SD)  absolute  changes  in  lipase  from 
baseline were -224.06 (249.87) U/L at Week 2 and -228.39 (262.95) U/L at Week 24 
Mean  (SD)  absolute  changes  in  amylase  from  baseline  were  -46.4  (73.7)  U/L  at  Week  2  and  -54.8 
(70.5)  U/L  at  Week  24  (Study  124  IAR/Table  12-14).  These  results  suggest  an  improvement  in 
pancreatic inflammation.

A  Phase  3b,  2-part,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Crossover  Study  With  a 
Long-term Open-label Period to Investigate Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Aged 
3 Through 5 Years Who Have a Specified CFTR Gating Mutation 
Patients  with  1  of  the  following  CFTR  gating  mutations  on  at  least  1  allele  were  eligible  to  enrol: 
G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D.  
During Part 1, subjects received 50 mg or 75 mg IVA (by body weight) or placebo q12h for 16 weeks: 
during  Treatment  Period  1  (Day  1  through  Week  8),  approximately  half  of  the  subjects  received 
placebo,  and  the  remaining  subjects  received  IVA.  Following  an  8-week  washout  period,  during 
Treatment Period 2 (Week 16 through Week 24), subjects who had received IVA in Treatment Period 1 
received  placebo,  and  subjects  who  had  received  placebo  in  Treatment  Period  1  received  IVA.  The

primary  endpoint  was  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  LCI2.5;  secondary  endpoints  were  absolute 
change from baseline in IRT, FE-1, weight, and body mass index (BMI) at 8 weeks of treatment in Part 
1.  
Approximately  50  subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled.  Following  a  review  of  study  enrolment  and 
assessment  of  the  available  number  of  potential  subjects  for  the  study,  Vertex  terminated  the  study 
early  because  of  enrolment  futility.  Only  14  subjects  were  enrolled  and  therefore  no  efficacy 
conclusions can be made from this study.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study  124  is  an  ongoing,  open-label,  2-part  phase  3  study  to  assess  safety,  PK,  PD  and  efficacy  of 
ivacaftor  in  CF  patients  1-2  years  old,  who  have  a  gating  type  CFTR  mutation  in  at  least  one  allele. 
This submission is based on: 
• 
• 
• 
previous evidence from well-controlled studies in CF subjects aged 6 years or older with gating 
mutations, 
results of study 108 (children aged 2-5 years), 
interim analysis of Cohort 1 and 5 data form study 124. 
This approach is considered appropriate to support an extension of indication. Design of study 124, in 
principle,  was  supported  by  previous  CHMP  advice  2010  -  EMEA/H/SA/1448/2/2010/PA/III,  where 
CHMP indicated that a positive trend in clinical endpoints, such as z-scores for growth and height, may 
be  sufficient  to  bridge  efficacy  to  the  less  than  6-years-of-age  population,  though  this  should  be 
supported  by  adequate  safety  data.  CHMP  further  agreed  that  pulmonary  function  tests  need  not  be 
used as an endpoint. Inclusion not only of patients with a G551D mutation, but also other non-G551D 
gating mutations was encouraged. 
A dose-response study was not performed. The posology recommendation is based on the results of a 
simulation  study.  Previously  developed  population  PK  model  was  used,  that  included  data  from 
subjects  2  -  5  years  of  age.  The  same  Cmin  and  AUC  values  were  targeted  that  in  adults.  The 
simulations  also  incorporated  a  maturation  function  to  determine  the  range  of  likely  exposures  given 
maturational changes in clearance. Based on results of simulations, a lower weight bound of 5 kg was 
determined to be more appropriate for subjects receiving the 25-mg dose to maintain exposures within 
the targeted range.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in study 124 were very similar to studies previously conducted with 
ivacaftor  (exc.  of  age).  CF  diagnosis  was  confirmed  if  the  subject  had  a  sweat  chloride  value  ≥60 
mmol/L  (by  quantitative  pilocarpine  iontophoresis)  or  2  CF-causing  mutations.  The  number  of  male 
and female subjects was similar. Subjects 12 to <24 months of age were enrolled in Cohort 1 of Part A 
and  Cohort  5  of  Part  B.  Younger  subjects  are  enrolled  in  subsequent  descending  age  cohorts  in  the 
study after PK and safety assessment for each preceding age cohort. The majority (16/19) of subjects 
had  a  G551D  gating  mutation;  2  subjects  had  the  S549N  gating  mutation;  and  1  subject  had  the 
G178R gating mutation at least in one allele. 
It  was  recommended  that  subjects  remained  on  a  stable  CF  medication regimen;  thus,  ivacaftor  was 
added to standard treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 41/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Part A, subjects received ivacaftor granules based on body weight (50 or 75 mg q12h) for 4 days. 
PK and safety were assessed. During Part B, study subjects received ivacaftor treatment for 24 weeks 
which is far long enough to detect short-term efficacy and short-term safety. In Part B, PD/efficacy and 
safety were evaluated.  
Efficacy  evaluation  was  tertiary  objective  in  this  study  (Part  B,  Cohort  5).  Efficacy  was  assessed  by 
using  nutritional  parameters,  biomarkers  for  pancreatic  and  intestinal  inflammation,  pulmonary 
exacerbation and hospitalisation due to CF. Lung function cannot be measured in this age group and if 
it could it was not informative for disease. To measure ventilation inhomogeneity, lung clearance index 
measure was performed. This is a multiple breath washout parameter detected by inert gas inhalation. 
LCI is an encouraged parameter to test small children’s ventilation; however, the test requires specific 
centres. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study population of Cohort 1 and 5 reflected well the targeted population. Study subject had G551D or 
other  approved  gating  CFTR  mutation  at  least  in  one  allele.  Boys  and  girls  were  roughly  evenly 
included.  Per  protocol,  subjects  who  had  an  R117H-CFTR  mutation  were  eligible  in  regions  where 
ivacaftor  is  approved  for  use  in  subjects  2  through  5  years  of  age  with  an  R117H-CFTR  mutation. 
However, no patient with R117H was enrolled into this study; thus, no data could be provided in young 
children with R117H CFTR mutation by this study.  
In Cohort 5, part B of study 124 all subjects weighed <14 kg (range: 7.5 to 12.4 kg) and therefore 
received IVA 50 mg q12h. The number of male and female subjects was similar. All subjects were 
White and the majority were of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The majority (16/19) of subjects had 
a G551D mutation. 
In Part B, all subjects with available baseline data (N=14) had very high sweat chloride values (around 
100 mmol/L), as all subjects harboured gating mutations which result generally in severe phenotype of 
CF.  For  the  remaining  5  subjects  baseline  data  were  not  available  as  the  amount  of  sweat  collected 
was  insufficient.  Following  2  weeks  of  treatment  a  robust  decrease  in  sweat  chloride  was  apparent 
(mean decrease 60 mmol/L), some patients must have had normal Cl values (suggested by minimum 
values). This robust improvement increased further on through week 24 visit. Waterfall plot shows that 
even  the  smallest  decrease  in  sweat  chloride  was  40  mmol/L,  thus  ivacaftor  resulted  in  all  subjects 
robust  chloride  decrease,  which  is  a  proof  of  pharmacodynamic  effect  in  line  with  previous  study 
results. It should be noted, however, that data of only 10 patients were displayed (who had available 
baseline and week 24 data).  As the reason  for not including all patients in the waterfall analysis the 
MAH  clarified  that  only  10  of  the  19  subjects  had  paired  sweat  chloride  test  results  at  both  baseline 
and at Week 24, only these 10 patients were included in the analysis of change from baseline at Week 
24. The mean change in sweat chloride in these 10 children was 73.5 mmol/L (95% CI 86.0, 61.0) at 
week 24. 
Small children with CF generally have normal lung function, as despite recurrent infections and small 
structural changes, lung compensates for a relatively long time. A more prominent sign of CF may be 
malnourishment (if any) in these children. However, growth parameters were normal or near-normal 
at baseline for most children enrolled in Cohort 5, part B of study 124. Pancreatic insufficient patients 
received enzyme-replacement therapy at baseline and during this study. Through week 24, all growth 
parameter increased. Considering that this population is normally a rapidly growing one, the MAH was 
requested to compare the change from baseline through week 24 in weight, length, BMI and respective 
z-scores of study subjects to historical values in those who were not treated with ivacaftor and had 
gating  mutation and were at the same age.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 42/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instead of the requested comparison versus historical values, the MAH stated that patients with Class I 
to III CF mutations, including gating mutations, who were <2 years of age had a median weight 
percentile of 44.3, a median length percentile of 29.2, and a median weight-for-length percentile of 
63.5 based on the 2016 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry Annual Data Report. At study 
124 baseline, children enrolled in Cohort 5, part B had a mean weight-for-age percentile of 60.3, a 
mean length-for-age percentile of 39.8, and a mean weight-for-length percentile of 68.2. The mean 
(95% CI) change from baseline at week 24 in the above measures was 4.5 (-2.4, 11.4), 11.1 (2.1, 
20.0), and 1.5 (-7.3, 10.3) respectively for the overall population of Cohort 5.   
Of the 6 subjects who had weight z-scores less than 0 at baseline, 3 (50%) had a z-score ≥0 after 24 
weeks of treatment with IVA (1 of 3 males and 2 of 3 females). Overall, 14 of 19 (73.7%) subjects had 
a z-score ≥0 after 24 weeks of treatment with IVA. The mean (SD) change in weight-for-age Z-score 
from baseline to week 24 restricted to children with a weight-for-age Z-score below 0 at baseline was 
0.12 (0.18) for boys and 0.51 (0.55) for girls.  
When the results by sex are compared to those of the overall population it would appear that the 
change in weight-for-age z-score is driven by that observed in girls (0.22 vs. 0.10) while in the case of 
length-for-age z-score, boys experienced a change of 0.38 vs. 0.17 in girls. Regarding weight-for-
length z-score, the change experienced by boys was -0.06 vs. 0.21 in girls. The MAH is of the opinion 
that there is no clinical rationale for the discrepancy in growth parameters by sex and the results 
observed are an artefact of the small sample size and high variability in ages within the cohort. This 
could lead to false assumptions and the potential for different treatment decisions between sexes, thus 
proposed to retain only the ‘all patient’ data in the label. This was agreed by CHMP and the results 
quoted in section 5.1 of Kalydeco granules are therefore those of the overall population for whom data 
were available at both baseline and week 24.  
Faecal elastase-1 is a marker for pancreatic sufficiency/insufficiency. Values below 200 μg /g indicate 
pancreatic insufficiency. Out of the 19 subjects in part B, cohort 5, 11 were considered to be pancreatic 
insufficient.  Mean  (SD)  FE-1  values  at  baseline  were  13.4  (12.3)  µg/g  for  pancreatic  insufficient 
subjects  and  414.4  (120.9)  µg/g  for  pancreatic  sufficient  subjects.    Nine  subjects  with  pancreatic 
insufficiency  had  values  of  FE-1  at  both  baseline  and  week  24.  The  mean  (SD)  change  from  baseline 
was  248.1  (132.9)  µg/g.  These  are  the  results  quoted  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  Six  of  these  9 
subjects  were  pancreatic  insufficient  at  baseline  (FE-1  <200  μg/g)  and  had  FE-1  >200  μg/g  at  Week 
24,  indicative  of  pancreatic  sufficiency.  No  subject  who  was  pancreatic  sufficient  at  baseline  became 
pancreatic  insufficient  after  24  weeks  of  treatment.  Although  these  results  are  indicative  of  the 
potential  for  IVA  treatment  to  improve  and  recover  exocrine  pancreatic  function  and  protect  against 
progressive exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in subjects 12 to <24 months old, data beyond 24 weeks 
are needed to conclude whether this effect is kept in the long term. 
Immunoreactive  trypsinogen  (IRT)  can  be  considered  a  marker  for  pancreatic  duct  obstruction. 
Consistently  with  study  108  data  (Changes  from  baseline in  IRT  at  Week  24  the  mean  (SD)  absolute 
change from baseline in IRT was -20.70 ng/mL (23.991)), a rapid decrease in mean IRT from baseline 
by  Week  2  that  was  sustained  through  Week  24,  suggest  an  improvement  of  pancreatic  status.  The 
mean  (SD)  change  from  baseline  at  week  24  in  IRT  limited  to  subjects  with  pancreatic  insufficiency 
(based  on  FE-1  values  of  less  than  200  µg/g)  who  had  values  at  both  points  in  time  was  −533.1 
(394.5)  ng/  ml  (n=10).  While  improvements  in  IRT  are  not  numerically  comparable  to  results  from 
prior studies due to the change of the assay used (which was discontinued by the manufacturer), the 
MAH states that the rapid and large improvement from baseline are clear and directionally consistent 
across IVA studies. However, data on IRT are difficult to interpret in the absence of a control group. As 
Assessment report

for  FE-1,  data  beyond  of  24  weeks  are  also  needed.  No  statements  or  recommendations  can  be 
included in the SmPC for the prescribing physicians.  
Enzyme  values  such  as  amylase  and  lipase  showed  substantial  decrease  by  week  2  and  was 
maintained through week 24, suggesting functional/structural improvement. 
The lung clearance index (LCI) is a lung function parameter derived from the multiple-breath washout 
(MBW) test. LCI is sensitive to early CF lung disease in patients of all ages from infancy to adulthood. 
A workshop in January 2014 by the North American Cystic Fibrosis Foundation concluded that the MBW 
text  is  a  valuable  potential  outcome  measure  for  CF  clinical  trials  in  preschool-aged  patients  and  in 
older  patients  with  FEV1  in  the  normal  range  in  multicenter  clinical  trials  as  well  as  clinical  care 
(Subbarao, Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2015 Jun;12(6):932-9.). MBW test was performed in a single patient 
in Study 124 and the change from baseline to week 24 was -0.41 indicating improved ventilation. 
At  baseline,  neither  patients  had  positive  culture  with  species  of  particular  concern  (P.  aeruginosa, 
Burkholderia ssp, MRSA) at any time point, however, even at this low age group of children 8/18 had 
positive sputum microbiology (H. influenza) and2/18 subjects had methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) and 
1/18  subject  had  both  (H.  influenza  and  methicillin-sensitive  S  (aureus),  this  is  the  usual  pattern  of 
lung  colonisation  at  this  age.  From  the  results,  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  regarding  effect  on 
pulmonary exacerbation or microbiology. 
100% of the subjects fully consumed the dose. The majority of subjects (17 [89.5%]) liked the study 
drug very much or liked it a little as detected by study personnel/caregiver. 
Regarding  study  123,  only  14  subjects  were  enrolled  and  therefore  no  efficacy  conclusions  can  be 
made from this study. Efficacy data were available for these 14 subjects, but for some subjects there 
were  incomplete  efficacy  measures.  Changes  from  baseline  in  LCI2.5  suggested  a  trend  towards 
greater  improvement  in  lung  function  with  ivacaftor  than  with  placebo.  There  were  trends  towards 
improvement with ivacaftor treatment in the secondary endpoints IRT, FE-1, BMI-for-age z-score, and 
weight-for-age  z-score.  Notably,  efficacy  and  safety  this  population  has  been  studied  in  study  108 
already,  although  it  was  an  open-label  study,  results  could  justify  an  extension  of  indication  for 
children older than 2 years and who had gating mutation. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  lack  of  appropriate  efficacy  endpoints  in  young  children  who  are  minimally  symptomatic 
hampers a robust demonstration of efficacy. The potential benefit of initiating treatment with ivacaftor 
at an early age is thought to be related to halt disease progression and/or prevent organ damage. To 
that end long-term data are needed that are unlikely to be generated pre-authorisation due to the life-
threatening  nature  of  the  disease.  Given  that  there  is  an  ongoing  post-authorisation  efficacy  study 
starting  ivacaftor  at  the  age  of  2  years,  children  from  12  to  less  than  24  months  are  strongly 
encouraged  to  be  included  too.  The  data  provided  in  the  ongoing  study  124  support  the  notion  that 
ivacaftor  in  the  short-term  is  associated  with  an  overall  improvement  of  the  disease  in  these  young 
children.  The  CHMP  considers  therefore  that  the  efficacy  of  ivacaftor  in  the  extension  to  use  for 
children  aged  12  to  less  than  24  months  has  been  demonstrated  taking  into  account  the  similar 
decrease  in  sweat  chloride  that  has  been  observed  in  these  children,  the  data  provided  on  growth 
parameters and faecal elastase-1 and the results obtained in older children and adult subjects.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Ivacaftor is generally well tolerated; the majority of adverse events associated with ivacaftor are mild 
to moderate in severity. The number of subjects in some important subgroups of the target population 
(e.g.  population  from  2  to  11  years-old)  is  rather  limited.  The  most  common  adverse  events  in  the 
ivacaftor  group  were  cough,  CF  lung  (pulmonary  exacerbation),  headache,  dizziness,  URTI,  nasal 
congestion, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, and rash. More patients in ivacaftor reported bacteria isolated 
in sputum. The mechanism of nervous system disorders is not known. Ear and labyrinths disorder and 
breast  disorders  have  been  observed  with  ivacaftor.  The  adverse  events  that  are  believed to  have  at 
least plausible causal relationship with the use of ivacaftor (adverse reactions) have been reflected in 
the SmPC. The most common adverse reactions are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache, nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and rash. 
This extension is mainly based on an interim analysis of Study 124, reporting data from subjects 12 to 
<24 months of age who completed Part A/Cohort 1 and/or Part B/Cohort 5 (through 24 weeks of IVA 
treatment). Study 124 is an ongoing, Phase 3, 2-part, open-label study in subjects <24 months of age 
who  have  1  of  the  following  mutations  on  at  least  1  CFTR  allele:  G551D,  G178R,  S549N,  S549R, 
G551S,  G1244E,  S1251N,  S1255P,  or  G1349D.  Subjects  with  an  R117H-CFTR  mutation  on  at  least 1 
allele are eligible to enrol in regions where IVA is approved for use in patients 2 through 5 years of age 
with an R117H mutation. Safety data from study 123 were also analysed.  
Patient exposure 
Subjects 12 to <24 months of age were enrolled in Cohort 1 of Part A (4 days of IVA treatment), with 
a  goal  to  select  a  dose  for  Cohort  5  of  Part  B  (24  weeks  of  IVA  treatment).  Safety  is  a  primary 
objective  in  Parts  A  and  B.  IVA  granules  were  administered  orally  every  12  hours  (q12h)  at  the 
following doses, after mixing with 5 mL of age appropriate soft food or liquid: 
•  50 mg for subjects weighing 7 to <14 kg 
•  75 mg for subjects weighing 14 to <25 kg 
At  each  study  visit  in  Part  B,  the  dose  for  each  subject  was  adjusted  based  on  body  weight,  if 
necessary. 
Part A/Cohort 1: Seven subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set. One subject continued 
into Part B/Cohort 5; the remaining 6 subjects all aged out of the eligible age range for Part B/Cohort 
5. 
Part B/Cohort 5: Subject disposition data for Part B are presented in Table 17 below. Nineteen subjects 
were  enrolled  and  included  in  the  safety  set.  The  mean  treatment  duration  (SD)  was  22.9  (5.06) 
weeks (range: 2 to 25 weeks). Eighteen subjects received >18 weeks of treatment.

Table 18 
The most common AEs (>20% incidence) included cough, alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate 
transaminase (AST) elevations, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, otitis media, and upper respiratory tract infection 
(Table 19 below). The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity and were 
considered unlikely to be related or not related to study drug.

Table 19 
Two subjects had a total of 4 SAEs. All but one (constipation) were considered unlikely or unrelated to 
study drug.  
Five subjects had transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN). Three 
subjects had transaminase elevations (ALT) >3 to ≤5 × ULN and remained on study drug continuously. 
Two subjects had transaminase elevations (ALT) >8 × ULN, both had alternative etiologies (concurrent 
infections) and resumed treatment following a short period of study drug interruption with no further 
elevations. No subjects had total bilirubin levels above the normal range. No treatment-emergent 
cataracts (lens opacities) were observed. There were no notable safety trends in other clinical 
laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameters. 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild to moderate in severity. There were no AEs that were 
considered to be life-threatening in severity. Two subjects had AEs that were considered severe. 
One  subject  had  3  severe  AEs  of  eczema  herpeticum,  distal  intestinal  obstruction  syndrome  (DIOS), 
and constipation. The AE of eczema herpeticum resolved after treatment and was considered unlikely 
related  to  study  drug.  The  AE  of  DIOS  was  considered  unlikely  related  to  study  drug,  and  the  AE  of 
constipation was considered possibly related to study drug; both AEs resolved. All 3 severe AEs were 
considered serious.  
Another subject had 3 severe AEs that occurred at the same time of ALT increased (>3 × ULN), AST 
increased (>2 × ULN), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased (>2 × ULN). The AEs of AST

increased and GGT increased were considered unlikely related to study drug. The AE of ALT increased 
was considered possibly related to study drug. All 3 AEs resolved without treatment. 
ALT and AST increased were the only AEs considered related or possibly related to study drug by the 
investigator to occur in ≥5 subjects. 
Study 123 
Treatment with IVA for 8 weeks in Part 1 and up to approximately 31 weeks in Part 2 in Study 123 was 
well  tolerated  in  this  population  of  3-  through  5-year-old  subjects  with  CFTR  gating  mutations.  The 
most  common  AEs  among  the  14  subjects  were  cough,  infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  CF,  and 
vomiting. 
All AEs were assessed as mild or moderate in severity and not related or unlikely related to study drug. 
There were no deaths and no treatment-emergent SAEs. No AEs led to discontinuation or interruption 
of study drug. No subject had an ALT level above 3 × ULN, an alkaline phosphatase level above 1.5 × 
ULN, or an AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, or total bilirubin level above the ULN. Liver function test 
levels above the ULN did not occur more commonly during the IVA treatment periods than during the 
placebo treatment period. There were no notable safety trends in other clinical laboratory or vital sign 
parameters. No treatment-emergent cataracts (lens opacities) were observed during the study.  
No new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified in Study 124 Part A/Cohort 1, Part B/Cohort 5, 
or Study 123. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment interruptions or discontinuations. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no notable findings from clinical laboratory, vital sign, and ECG parameters. For liver 
function test results, please see Table 20 below. 
Table 20 
The  majority  of  subjects  had  maximum  on-treatment  ALT  or  AST  ≤2  ×  ULN.  Five  subjects  had 
transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 x ULN. Three subjects had transaminase elevations (ALT) >3

to  ≤5  ×  ULN  and  remained  on  study  drug  continuously.  Two  subjects  had  transaminase  elevations 
(ALT)  >8  ×  ULN,  both  had  alternative  etiologies  (concurrent  infections)  and  resumed  treatment 
following  a  short  period  of  study  drug  interruption  with  no  further  elevations.  No  subjects  had  AST 
and/or ALT elevations >5 to ≤8 x ULN. No subjects had total bilirubin levels above the ULN. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Assessment of drug-drug and other interactions was conducted and there were no unique findings due 
to age to suggest a safety concern. There were no AEs identified caused by DDI in Study 124. The DDI 
profile in children 12 to <24 months of age is expected to be the same as that in older subjects based 
on the following:  
•  CYP3A maturation has reached full adult activity by 12 months of age.  
• 
• 
Population  PK  analyses  support  that  changes  in  IVA  disposition  can  be  accounted  for  by 
changes  in  body  weight  and  that  the  impact of  CYP  maturation on  IVA  disposition  in  this  age 
group are minimal.  
IVA exposures were comparable to adults in this age group. 
The current SmPC adequately reflects necessary information for this age group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse event 
No such events were reported. 
Post marketing experience 
The ADRs identified from previously completed studies include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection, headache, nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, rash, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Most 
of  these  ADRs  are  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  resolved  with  continued  IVA  treatment.  Other 
potential  risks  include  elevated  transaminases,  drug-drug  interactions,  and  cataracts  (lens  opacities). 
These  risks  are  adequately  managed  through  product  labelling,  including  recommendation  of  close 
monitoring  of  unexplained  elevations  in  transaminase  levels  until  resolution  and  proper  dose 
adjustments when IVA is used concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors. 
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted as part of the safety study 126 included in the 
pharmacovigilance plan to further characterise the risk of chataract as in the postmarketing experience 
reports of lens abnormalities have been received. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Ivacaftor was well tolerated during the 4 days, 24 days or 8 weeks of in study 124, part A, part B and 
study 123, respectively. Of note, study 124 was conducted in 1-2 years old children, while study 123 
in  3-5  years  olds.  According  to  available  data  (interim  analysis  of  two  cohorts  or  incomplete  study 
results) both studies, AEs were generally those that are typical for CF patients of this age group. The 
most  common  AEs  were  cough,  ALT  or  AST  elevations,  pyrexia,  rhinorrhea,  otitis  media,  and  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  (or  vomiting  in  study  123).  The  majority  of  subjects  had  AEs  mild  or 
moderate in severity. There were no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to AEs. No treatment-
emergent  cataracts  (lens  opacities)  were  observed.  There  were  no  notable  safety  trends  in  other 
clinical  laboratory,  vital  sign,  or  ECG  parameters.In  study  124,  part  B,  Cohort  5,  two  subjects  had  a 
total of 4 SAEs. Seven subjects reported related AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018

Five subjects had transaminase elevations (ALT) >3 × ULN. Three subjects had transaminase 
elevations (ALT) >3 to ≤5 x ULN and remained on study drug continuously. Two subjects had 
transaminase elevations (ALT) >8 x ULN, both had alternative etiologies (concurrent infections) and 
resumed treatment following a short period of study drug interruption with no further elevations. No 
subjects had total bilirubin levels above the normal range. The hypothesis that elevated LTFs could 
rather be attributed to amoxicillin is not agreed for the first case, as ivacaftor treatment, interruption 
and resolution of laboratory parameters are paralleled. However, CF itself can cause liver injury and 
this is also a well-identified risk with ivacaftor treatment. This case was fully managed with treatment 
interruption and further LFTs were not detected. No further action was required. The risk of 
hepatotoxicity will be further characterised in a safety study in the post-marketing setting (i.e. study 
126). This study will also allow for the characterisation of use in children aged 12 months to 11 years 
due to the limited number of patients evaluated in study 124. 
No new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified in Study 124 Part A/Cohort 1, Part B/Cohort 5, 
or Study 123. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Acknowledging the shortcomings of the trial design, such as the lack of control, relative short duration 
of  study  124  (interim  analysis  of  completed  cohorts)  and  small  sample  size  due  to  the  rarity  of  the 
disease, a full safety evaluation of ivacaftor in 1-2 years old children with CF carrying gating mutations 
is  limited.  However,  all  available  data  suggest  similar  safety  profile  in  the  new  target  population 
compared to the already approved one. This is considered reassuring. In addition, further data will be 
generated in the ongoing studies with ivacaftor. 
Overall, no new adverse event or adverse drug reaction were identified. The adverse events, incidence 
and  relatedness  are  comparable  to  that  in  previous  Phase  3  studies  conducted  for  the  already 
approved indications. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
updates made to the package leaflets are minimal, and the structure and guidance for caregivers 
remains aligned to the principles agreed on in procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/X/0034/G 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is removed from the 
additional monitoring list as the imposed PASS (i.e. 5-year long term observational study) which is a 
condition to the marketing authorisation has been fulfilled.  
Therefore the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this 
will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle, is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CF  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disease  with  serious,  chronically  debilitating  morbidities  and  high 
premature  mortality  and,  at  present,  has  no  cure.  CF  affects  approximately  78,000  individuals 
worldwide,  with  approximately  29,000  individuals  in  the  US;  42,000  individuals  in  the  EU;  4,200 
individuals in Canada; and 3,200 individuals in Australia. CF greatly affects the paediatric population, 
as  approximately  half  of  the  total  population  with  CF  is  <18  years  of  age.  Pancreatic  destruction 
leading  to  pancreatic  exocrine  insufficiency  begins  in  utero,  and  lung  involvement  is  manifested  by 
pulmonary inflammation and infection that begins shortly after birth. Despite progress in the treatment 
of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 41.6 
years.  Although  the  disease  affects  multiple  organs,  progressive  loss  of  lung  function  is  the  leading 
cause of mortality. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no fully effective cure for CF. Hence, the goals of current CF therapies are to slow or 
reverse disease progression, manage symptoms and complications such as pancreatic insufficiency and 
respiratory  infections,  and  improve  quality  of  life.  The  majority  of  CF  therapies  currently  available, 
including  nutritional  supplements,  antibiotics,  and  mucolytics,  target  the  downstream  consequences 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 54/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  symptoms  of  the  disease.  The  CFTR  modulators  (i.e.,  correctors  and  potentiators)  target  the 
underlying cause of CF with the potential to alter the course of the disease. These CFTR modulators are 
not a cure for CF and must be taken chronically for the patient to maintain treatment benefits. 
Kalydeco  (IVA),  Orkambi  (lumacaftor/IVA),  and  Symdeko  (tezacaftor  [TEZ]/IVA  +  IVA)  are  the  CFTR 
modulators currently approved for CF patients. Kalydeco is approved in the US, Canada, EU, and other 
regions  for  treatment  in  patients  ≥2  years  of  age  with  certain  IVA-responsive  mutations.  Orkambi  is 
approved  in  the  US,  Canada,  and  EU  for  treatment  in  patients  ≥6  years  of  age,  homozygous  for 
F508del, and is approved in other regions for treatment in older populations. Symdeko is approved in 
the  US  for  treatment  in  patients  ≥12  years  of  age,  homozygous  for  F508del  or  with  a  TEZ/IVA-
responsive mutation. 
At this time, there is no approved CFTR modulator therapy available for CF patients <2 years of age. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Previously evaluated studies: 
Studies 102, 103, 110 and 111 were performed in subjects with gating or R117H mutation in at least 
one allele of CFTR gene (≥6 years of age).  
Study 108 was an uncontrolled OL study in subjects 2 through 5 years of age  
Studies  105,  112  and  109  were  OL-long  term  studies  in  subjects  ≥6  years  of  age  and  in  subjects  2 
through 5 years of age, respectively (Study 109) 
Registry studies: Long-term Safety Study (all patients with a record of Kalydeco use in the US and UK 
CF registries). 
Recently submitted study:  
Study  124  is  an  OL,  ongoing  study  in  patients  aged  <24  months,  interim  (week  24)  analysis  was 
submitted in two cohorts of this study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Treatment with ivacaftor targets the functional defect of the mutated CFTR protein and improves CFTR 
function,  resulting  in  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  improvements  in  PPFEV1,  Cystic 
Fibrosis  Questionnaire-Revised  respiratory  domain,  weight/BMI,  and  commensurate  changes  in  sweat 
chloride for subjects ≥6 years of age (Studies 102, 103, and 111).  
Results  from  Study  108  demonstrated  that  ivacaftor  improves  CFTR  function  in  subjects  2  through  5 
years of age, resulting in positive effects on nutritional status and pancreatic function. 
Sustained,  long-term  benefits  of  IVA  treatment  were  demonstrated  in  clinical  studies  of  ivacaftor  in 
subjects ≥6 years of age (Studies 105 and 112) and in subjects 2 through 5 years of age (Study 109). 
Furthermore,  up  to  5  years  of  data  in  the  Long-term  Safety  Study  (all  patients  with  a  record  of 
Kalydeco  use  in  the  US  and  UK  CF  registries)  showed  lower  risks  for  death,  organ  transplantation, 
hospitalizations,  PEx,  and  serious  safety  outcomes  in  IVA-treated  patients  relative  to  untreated 
comparators. 
Interim analysis of Cohort A and B of Study 124 demonstrated the ability of ivacaftor to increase CFTR 
function  in  subjects  12  to  <24  months,  as  evidenced  by  an  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  sweat 
chloride  of  -73.5(17.5)  [mean  (SD)],  mmol/L.  This  provides  additional  support  for  extrapolation  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/799967/2018  
Page 55/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efficacy.  For  children  with  available  data  at  both  baseline  and  week  24,  the  mean  (95%  CI)  change 
from baseline at week 24 in weight-, length-, and weight-for-length percentiles was 4.5 (-2.4, 11.4), 
11.1  (2.1,  20.0),  and  1.5  (-7.3,  10.3)  respectively  for  the  overall  population  of  Cohort  5.    In  nine 
children  who  were  pancreatic  insufficient  at  baseline,  the  mean  (SD)  change  at  week  24  in  faecal 
elastase-1 was 248.1 (132.9) µg/g. In six of them, the level at week 24 was above 200 μg/g.  
Overall,  the  clinical  benefits  of  ivacaftor  treatment  may  be  supported  in  children  12  to  less  than  24 
months by numerically positive effects on markers of pancreatic function and pancreatic inflammation 
(by  measuring  IRT  and  FE-1  and  IRT,  serum  lipase and  serum  amylase levels)  as  well  as  maintained 
generally  good  nutritional  status,  as  measured  by  growth  parameters,  such  as  absolute  change  from 
baseline in weight-for-age Z-score  (0.15 units) and absolute changes from baseline in length-for-age 
Z-score (0.28 units).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The level of evidence of an interim analysis in two cohorts of an open-label study is limited. However, 
it  can  be  considered  sufficient  for  support  extrapolation  efficacy  and  safety  from  already  approved 
population  to  1-2  years  old  children,  based  on  previous  experience.  The  duration  of  study  is  rather 
short and there is uncertainty whether the improvement is maintained. 
Lung function correlates with mortality in CF patients. There are no firm data to support lung function 
improvement  (as  spirometry  cannot  be  performed  at  this  age  and  LCI  could  not  be  systematically 
measured in this study) or slower rate of decline of lung function when starting treatment as early as 
of  1  year.  This  can  be,  however,  hypothesised  based  on  already  existing  long-term  data,  but  needs 
further  confirmation.  Long  term  data  are  needed  to  establish  a  beneficial  effect  of  ivacaftor  on  lung 
function and microbiological endpoints and to confirm positive results on nutrition in this age group. 
Graphical  analysis  revealed  no  relationship  between  ivacaftor  exposure  and  sweat  chloride  response. 
Thus, the claimed efficacy claim is not directly supported by exposure-response (POP-PK/PD) analysis.  
Additionally,  there  appears  to  be  a  negative  trend  between  age  and  clearance.    The  reason  of  age 
dependent  clearance  remained  unclarified  but  currently  not  considered  as  a  clinically  significant 
problem. 
Data at baseline and week 24 for some endpoints were not available for all children enrolled in Cohort 
5, part B of study 124. Appropriate explanation has been given by the MAH (e.g., the volume of sweat 
collected at baseline was insufficient in 5 children to determine sweat chloride which is not uncommon 
in young children). The SmPC only quotes results for children with both values available.  
The lack of a control group somehow hampers the appropriate interpretation of the efficacy data 
provided, but the consistency seen in all parameters measured is reassuring. Regarding faecal 
calprotectin levels, results may be indicative of reduction of inflammation, however, elevated faecal 
calprotectin naturally declines from birth to its nadir at 4 years and therefore the interpretation of the 
above results is confounded by this issue in the absence of a control group. The very similar 
consideration applies for IRT levels. Based on FE-1 levels (with a cut-off at 200 μg/g), the MAH states 
that 6 children became pancreatic sufficient. However, none of them apparently could stop pancreatic 
enzyme supplementation as this possibility was not pre-specified in the study protocol. Furthermore, 
data beyond 24 weeks of treatment are needed to confirm that the results in FE-1, IRT etc. are 
maintained.   
The effect of discontinuing prescribed therapies for CF while remaining on ivacaftor treatment has not 
been evaluated. During Study 124, subjects continued on their prescribed CF therapies. Thus, as is the

case for patients ≥24 months of age, ivacaftor will be recommended for use in addition to other 
prescribed therapies for CF. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  ivacaftor  has  been  well  characterised.  Adverse  drug  reactions  identified  from 
previously  completed  studies  include  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  headache, 
nasal  congestion,  oropharyngeal  pain,  rash,  abdominal  pain,  and  diarrhoea.  Most  of  these  ADRs  are 
mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  resolved  with  continued  ivacaftor  treatment.  Other  potential  risks 
include elevated transaminases, drug-drug interactions, and cataracts (lens opacities). These risks are 
properly  managed  through  product  labeling,  including  recommendation  of  close  monitoring  of 
unexplained elevations in transaminase levels until resolution and proper dose adjustments when IVA 
is  used  concomitantly  with  moderate  or  strong  CYP3A  inhibitors.  In  addition,  baseline  and  follow-up 
ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients treated with IVA. Safety results 
in subjects 12 to <24 months in Study 124 were generally consistent with those in subjects ≥2 years of 
age,  with  no  new  safety  concerns  identified.  Transaminase  elevations  were  observed;  however,  all 
subjects were able to either maintain or successfully resume ivacaftor treatment following interruption. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety of long-term ivacaftor treatment in subjects 12 to <24 months is being evaluated in the 96-
week  open-label  extension  Study  126,  final  results  of  which  are  due  in  March  2022  as  stated  in  the 
RMP .

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Reduction  in  decline  in  FEV1  correlates  with  mortality  in  CF.  In  young  children,  however,  spirometry 
cannot  be  performed,  as  they  have  generally  well-preserved  lung  function  at  this  age,  in  addition, 
small children cannot cooperate properly. In small children, nutritional status is more indicative about 
disease burden. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Interim  results  from  Study  124  demonstrated  that  ivacaftor  improves  CFTR  function  in  subjects  1 
through 2 years of age who have a mutation that causes CFTR gating defects, with positive effects on

sweat chloride, nutritional status and pancreatic function. According to ICH E11 (Clinical Investigation 
of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population) “when a medicinal product is to be used in younger 
paediatric patients for the same indication(s) as those studied in older paediatric patients, the disease 
process is similar, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be comparable, extrapolation of efficacy from 
older  to  younger  paediatric  patients  may  be  possible.  In  such  cases,  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the 
relevant age groups of paediatric patients likely to receive the medicinal product, together with safety 
studies, may be sufficient to provide adequate information for paediatric use.” Although the underlying 
defect  in  cystic  fibrosis  is  the  same  across  all  ages,  the  heterogeneity  of  disease  effects  in  target 
organs and the progression of the disease over time lead to clinical manifestations that vary according 
to  age.  The  implementation  of  newborn  screening  programmes  has  shown  that  early  interventions 
such  as  nutritional  support,  eradication  of  early  lung  colonisation/infection  etc.  are  associated  to 
improved health outcomes and quality of life. It can be assumed that drugs targeting the basic defect 
of  the  mutant  CFTR  protein  such  as  CFTR  modulators  may  have  the  potential  to  slow  disease 
progression  and  earlier  treatment  would  result  in  better  outcomes.  Some  uncertainties  regarding  PK 
were identified that do not preclude the use of ivacaftor for these young children. 
Based  on  the  principles  of  paediatric  extrapolation,  the  benefits  of  ivacaftor  treatment  could  be 
extended to patients with all approved gating CFTR mutations as some “other concerns” raised during 
evaluation have been resolved.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kalydeco is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Extension of Indication to include treatment of cystic fibrosis in children age 12 to less than 24 
months who have one of the currently approved gating mutations in the CFTR gene for Kalydeco 50 
mg & 75 mg Granules; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. Relevant consequential changes are made to the Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablet 
Product Information. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
The RMP version 8.1 has also been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0045/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol, Cayston and TOBI 
Podhaler within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
See appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include treatment of cystic fibrosis in children age 12 to less than 24 
months who have one of the currently approved gating mutations in the CFTR gene for Kalydeco 50 
mg & 75 mg Granules; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. Relevant consequential changes are made to the Kalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablet 
Product Information. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
The RMP version 8.1 has also been submitted.

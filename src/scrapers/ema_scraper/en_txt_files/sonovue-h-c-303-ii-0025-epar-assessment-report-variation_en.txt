2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
SonoVue is an ultrasound contrast agent (USCA). It contains sulphur hexafluoride (a gas) as 
microbubbles in suspension in a liquid, after made up into a solution (kit including one vial of gas and 
powder and one pre-filled syringe containing 5 ml of solvent). It is intravenous administered. 
Sonovue was centrally approved in Europe in 2001. Other USCA in European centralised procedure are 
Luminity (perflutren) and Optison (perflutren, authorised on 1998). SonoVue is approved in 36 countries 
world-wide and marketed in 25 countries world-wide. 
SonoVue is for use with ultrasound imaging to enhance the echogenicity of the blood, which results in 
an improved signal to noise ratio. SonoVue should only be used in patients where study without contrast 
enhancement is inconclusive: 
- Echocardiography: SonoVue is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in 
patients with suspected or established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac 
chambers and enhance left ventricular endocardial border delineation. 
- Doppler of macrovasculature: SonoVue increases the accuracy in detection or exclusion of 
abnormalities in cerebral arteries and extracranial carotid or peripheral arteries by improving the  
Doppler signal to noise ratio. SonoVue increases the quality of the Doppler flow image and the 
duration of clinically-useful signal enhancement in portal vein assessment. 
- Doppler of microvasculature: SonoVue improves display of the vascularity of liver and breast 
lesions during Doppler sonography, leading to more specific lesion characterisation.  
In May of 2004, SonoVue was temporarily suspended from the European market for the cardiac 
indication, based on reports of 3 cases of adverse events with fatal outcome and temporal relationship to 
SonoVue administered for echocardiography in patients with underlying severe cardiac disease. SonoVue 
remained on the market for use in extra cardiac indications. In July 2004, the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the re-instatement of the cardiac indication, but required 
the introduction of contraindications to avoid the use of the product in patients with recent acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease, including: evolving or on-going

myocardial infarction, typical angina at rest within last 7 days, significant worsening of cardiac symptoms 
within last 7 days coronary artery intervention or other factors suggesting clinical instability (for example, 
recent deterioration of electrocardiogram [ECG], laboratory or clinical findings), acute cardiac failure, 
Class III/IV cardiac failure, or severe rhythm disorders. Since 2004, additional information on the safety 
of SonoVue has become available from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, with estimated 
exposure of over 2 million patients. 
Current contra-indications are:  
• 
• 
• 
known hypersensitivity to sulphur hexafluoride or to any of the components of SonoVue. 
patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease, 
including: evolving or on-going myocardial infarction, typical angina at rest within last 7 days, 
significant worsening of cardiac symptoms within last 7 days, recent coronary artery intervention or 
other factors suggesting clinical instability (for example, recent deterioration of ECG, laboratory or 
clinical findings), acute cardiac failure, Class III/IV cardiac failure, or severe rhythm disorders. 
patients known to have right-to-left shunts, severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery 
pressure >90 mmHg), uncontrolled systemic hypertension, and in patients with adult respiratory 
distress syndrome. 
• 
pregnancy and lactation.  
In the currently submitted type II variation, the applicant is requesting the deletion in Section 4.3 of the 
contraindications for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac 
disease and the insertion of these patient populations into Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions 
for use, with editing of the wording as appropriate. These changes are also reflected in revised wording 
for the PIL.  
The principle of this deletion was subjected to an EMA scientific advice on 20 September 2012. In 
conclusion, the CHMP recommended to the Applicant to submit a type II variation where the proposed 
change to the SmPC would be supported by the following: 
•  A summary and discussion of similarities and differences in pharmaceutical composition of registered 
USCAs that could possibly be relevant to risk of adverse CV outcome. 
•  All relevant (comparative) haemodynamic or other (clinical) pharmacology data that could address 
the question of potential underlying mechanism for CV risk. The Applicant should explore options for 
additional investigations in a sensitive model. 
•  Meaningful observational/epidemiological / pharmacovigilance data that is relevant to the specific 
patient population at hand (in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome of clinically unstable 
ischaemic cardiac disease) and would enable a comparison between this agent and other similar 
USCARs (e.g. patient matching). 
It was not considered meaningful to expect that a prospectively planned comparative safety trial of 
feasible size will be sufficiently sensitive and informative to support a decision to remove the mentioned 
contraindications form the label.

Additional revisions to Product information (SmPC/PIL) in accordance to QRD v.9 are also proposed, 
following consultation and agreement by EMA. 
Note 
Narrative summaries for the 3 post-marketing surveillance cases with fatal outcome and temporal 
relationship to SonoVue which led to the temporary suspension of the product from the European market 
are described below. 
• Case BRO-005943 (Germany, 2002) describes a 69-year-old male patient with history of anterior and 
posterior myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) and stent 
placement in left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was admitted for an angiographic follow-up, 
which showed 3-vessel disease (occlusion of right coronary artery, RCA, high grade restenosis in distal 
LAD stent, and several stenoses in left circumflex artery, LCx). A new revascularization of LAD in-stent-
restenosis was performed successfully. The following day, the patient was feeling well except for an 
unusual restlessness and before undergoing echocardiography with SonoVue. About 4-5 minutes following 
the 2nd injection of 2-2.5 mL SonoVue, the restlessness increased, heart rate decreased from 90 bpm to 
50 bpm, blood pressure also decreased, accompanied by cold sweat. An anaphylactic shock was initially 
suspected and the patient treated accordingly, but the patient’s conditions continued to deteriorate. An 
emergency coronary angiography performed after the SonoVue study showed a complete, new 
thrombotic reocclusion of the LAD-stent and PTCA was performed successfully with restored TIMI III Flow. 
The patient’s blood pressure was recorded as approximately 100 mmHg and cardiac rhythm was 
normalized. The patient was transferred to ICU with intra-aortic balloon pump. Later at ICU, the patient 
developed bradycardia and a ventricular escape rhythm and despite treatment, the patient died of a 
cardiogenic shock. The fatal outcome was considered by the reporter to be related to the underlying 
severe cardiac disease and unrelated to the administration of SonoVue. 
• Case BRO-006772 (Germany, 2003) concerns a 49-year-old male patient with 3-vessel coronary artery 
disease and a history of multiple myocardial infarctions, severe reduction of left ventricular function 
(ejection fraction 31%) due to a new, recent acute anterior myocardial infarction. The patient underwent 
multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) of the LAD, but no revascularization procedure was 
performed on the significant, 80% to 90% narrowing of the LCx and RCA. One month after PCI, he 
underwent a rest echocardiogram with SonoVue to assess left ventricular function. The exam was 
eventless. The patient became unconscious after the exam while getting up from the examination table. 
No ECG was available at the onset of event. During the event the ECG showed asystole, blood pressure 
and pulse were not measurable. The patient was immediately treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
measures. Despite treatment, the patient developed pulseless electrical activity followed by ventricular 
fibrillation. The patient was announced dead 40 minutes after the resuscitation was started. No autopsy 
was performed. Due to the temporal relationship, a role of SonoVue in the development of the initial 
hypotension was considered possible. 
• Case BCM-000767 (Italy, 2003) describes a 51-year-old patient suffering from 40% occlusion of the 
common trunk and recent anterior myocardial infarction treated with PTCA of LAD. The patient developed 
a bundle branch block. An echocardiogram with SonoVue was performed one month later. About 2 
minutes after SonoVue injection, the patient reported throat burning and back pain. Echocardiogram 
showed asystole. Despite the reanimation procedures and pharmacological treatment with adrenaline, 
cortisone and fibrinolytic agents, the patient died. The autopsy showed a 90% stenosis at the ostium of 
the common trunk and a thrombus completely occluding the distal common trunk. The autopsy report 
indicated the cause of death as “presence of thrombus occluding common trunk”. Based on the autopsy 
report, the reporting physician excluded a role of SonoVue in the onset of the reported event and

subsequent fatal outcome and considered the observed events related to the thrombotic occlusion of the 
common trunk.  
2.2.  Quality  aspects 
SonoVue is formulated as a 25 mg sterile, non-pyrogenic lyophilized powder in a septum-sealed vial. The 
gas phase in the vial is SF6, an innocuous gas. The lyophilized powder is made of a combination of 
pharmaceutical grade polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, phospholipids, and palmitic acid. Phospholipids 
from chemical synthesis were selected for their high chemical purity and low pyrogenic potential. In 
SonoVue, the phospholipid component is a mixture of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and 
dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol sodium (DPPG.Na). 
The microbubble dispersion is prepared before use by injecting 5 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% w/v 
solution for injection, USP, into the content of the vial. The vial is then shaken for a few seconds to 
provide a homogeneous dispersion. Each mL of SonoVue dispersion contains 8 µL SF6 in the 
microbubbles. The desired volume of the dispersion can be drawn into a syringe at any time up to 6 hours 
after reconstitution. Just before drawing into the syringe, the vial should be agitated to re-suspend the 
microbubbles.

Conclusion on pharmaceutical comparability  
There are some differences among the agents: 
•  SonoVue and Luminity are both based on phospholipid-stabilized microbubbles. Unlike SonoVue 
and Luminity, Optison microbubbles are stabilized by protein (human serum albumin, HSA). 
•  SonoVue shows a more controlled bubble size distribution than Luminity and Optison. 
•  Maximum bubble size is smaller for Luminity and SonoVue (20 microns [µ]), than for Optison (32 
µ). 
•  SonoVue uses a lesser amount of phospholipids and contains lower gas volumes than Luminity.

Based on information provided in Table above based on the pharmaceutical composition of the 
three approved USCAs (Optison, Luminity and SonoVue), similarities and differences among the 
agents are summarized below: 
•  All three agents in the marketplace have in common a particulate structure. They differ with regard 
to composition (human serum albumin vs phospholipids) and concentrations (750 µg/mL vs 84 
µg/mL for Luminity and SonoVue, respectively). 
•  Risk of gas embolism is none or remote at the approved doses because: 
-  The number of bubbles and the volumes of gas administered with approved doses are 
comparable. Actually, only minute amounts of gas are administered with an imaging dose, 
especially with SonoVue (16 to 38 µL vs approx. 240 µL with Luminity and 0.1- 
1.7 mg with Optison); 
-  Maximum bubble size is 20 μm for Luminity and SonoVue, 32 μm for Optison; 
-  Mean bubble sizes range from 1.5 to 4.5 μm. This range provides strong echo 
enhancement over a broad frequency range (2-10 MHz); 
-  Coalescence of bubbles does not occur for any agent; 
-  While bubble numbers in the order of 3-13 x 10
8 
in each milliliter for SonoVue seems very large, 
9
the number of capillaries in the human body is many times larger (estimated at 40 x 10
). 
Microscopic examination of the capillary bed in animal models such as the hamster cheek pouch 
or rat spinotrapezius muscle do not reveal any bubbles after administration to the animal of 
doses equivalent to the human imaging dose.
Doses administered need to be at least 100 or 
200 times the equivalent human dose before the presence of bubbles in capillaries can be 
observed. Of note, the SonoVue microbubbles always exhibited microvascular transit properties 
similar to those of the red blood cells. 
•  All agents make use of low solubility gases in order to achieve longer persistence. SF6 and C3F8 are 
non-toxic and not metabolized. They are exhaled within minutes, also by patients with restrictive lung 
disease. 
•  SonoVue and Luminity are comparable since both are based on phospholipid-stabilized microbubbles. 
However; SonoVue shows a more controlled bubble size distribution, makes use of less phospholipids 
and contains lower gas volumes. 
•  Cardiovascular risk is not expected to depend on predictable adverse reactions to any of the 
components or agents’ composition. 
• 
Potential hypersensitivity to any of the components of these USCAs cannot be excluded, with the 
potential for unpredictable, serious hypersensitivity reactions. 
2.3.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects  
The clinical pharmacology studies included in this application are aimed at providing information that 
could reasonably exclude underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular risk in the general population and, 
more important, in critically ill patients. 
To this purpose, the following studies are included: 
•  Study BR1-112: single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-way crossover comparison of the 
Assessment report

effects on QTc interval of single IV injections of two bolus doses of SonoVue (0.1 and 0.5 mL/kg) 
with matched volumes of placebo in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD); 0.1 
and 0.5 mL/kg correspond to 7 and 35 mL in a 70-kg person, i.e., approx. 3.5 and 17.5 times the 
recommended single dose of SonoVue in echocardiography (2 mL, i.e., approx. 0.03 mL/kg in a 70-
kg person. 
•  Study BR1-113: single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 4-way crossover study to compare 
the effects on QTc of 0.1 mL/kg IV bolus of SonoVue and placebo in conjunction with continuous 
heart insonation mode at mechanical index (MI) settings of 0.4–0.5 and 1.5–1.6 in CAD patients. 
•  Study BR1-016: placebo-controlled, randomized study in patients with congestive heart failure 
(NYHA class II-III), Ejection Fraction (EF) < 45% and referred for right cardiac catheterization, 
echocardiography and multi-gated (MUGA) radionuclide angiography. 
•  Study BR1-133: single-blind, placebo controlled, study to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of 
SonoVue in subjects (at least 30) with and without pulmonary hypertension, scheduled for 
pulmonary artery catheterization. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as mean pulmonary arterial 
pressure ≥ 25.0 mmHg, according to the ACCF/AHA 2009 expert consensus document. 
•  Study BR1-022: randomized, single-blind, crossover comparison of the effects on respiratory 
function of 4 mL IV bolus of SonoVue or placebo in patients with moderate-to- severe COPD; 4 mL is 
two times higher than the single dose of SonoVue approved for its use in echocardiography. 
•  Study BR1-036: primarily conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SF6 following intravenous 
administration of 0.3 mL/kg SonoVue in patients with severe restrictive lung disease due to DIPF, the 
evaluation of safety was also a primary objective of the study (ECG, vital sings, oxygen saturation). 
The final Clinical Study Reports for 5 of this 6 clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted in 
previous applications (BR1-112, BR1-113, BR1-016, BR1-022, and BR1-036). The final report for study 
BR1-133 has not been submitted previously and the full final report is included in this submission.

MAH’s Conclusion from supportive clinical studies 
Clinical pharmacology studies did not show any significant effect, including after high dose 
administration or during continuous insonation at high mechanical index, on the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
pulmonary hemodynamics; 
pulmonary function; 
blood pressure and other vital signs; 
oxygen saturation; 
cardiac function; 
electrocardiographic parameters; and 
laboratory test results. 
Cardiovascular risk does not seem to depend on predictable adverse reactions to the 
administration of SonoVue, as demonstrated in several patient populations with chronic 
condition affecting cardiac and pulmonary functions. 
Assessment report

The mechanistic basis for rare unpredictable hypersensitive reactions to SonoVue, other USCAs and 
other types of contrast agents (used in radiographic or magnetic resonance exams) is still largely 
unknown. Potential hypersensitivity to one of the components of USCAs cannot be excluded, with 
the potential for unpredictable, serious hypersensitivity reactions. 
In conclusion, based on data from SonoVue clinical pharmacology studies, no significant risks are 
identified for ventricular repolarization or for pulmonary hemodynamics or function after 
administration of SonoVue in patient populations with several types of chronic clinical conditions with

2.4.  Clinical Safety aspects  
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Safety assessments of SonoVue include data from SonoVue clinical studies in humans; post-marketing 
surveillance from launch (26 March 2001) to 31 December 2012; and reports in the published literature 
with relevant safety data. 
Results 
1) Clinical trials 
Safety data from 75 completed studies have been pooled to provide the integrated safety database for 
the SonoVue clinical program conducted in North America, Europe, and Asia as of 31 December 2012.  A 
total of 6469 subjects have participated in the 75 completed studies included in the Integrated SonoVue 
Safety Database; 6307 subjects received SonoVue (either exclusively or in addition to control agent in 
cross-over studies) and 162 subjects received control agent only.  
Adverse Reactions Reported with the Use of SonoVue in Clinical Trials 
Of the 6307 subjects who received SonoVue in the All Completed Studies (including subjects who 
received SonoVue plus control in crossover studies), 675 (10.7%) experienced 1064 adverse events 
(Table O).  Study agent-related adverse events were reported by 331 subjects (5.2%).  The majority of 
events were mild and resolved without sequelae.  Only 9 subjects had adverse events that were 
considered severe in intensity (1 of which experienced hypertension and chills considered by the 
Investigator to be of ‘unknown’ relationship to study agent administration). Serious adverse events were 
reported for 27 subjects (0.4%); all except 5 events (2 of which had “unknown” relationship recorded in 
the clinical trial database, the third “probable” relationship; however subsequent information on all 3 
cases suggests a possibility of no relationship to the investigational product) were considered to be not 
related to study agent. One additional subject experienced a non-serious adverse event during study 
participation, which became serious when the subject was hospitalized due to worsening of symptoms 
outside of the protocol-defined reporting window (after the 24 hours post-dose monitoring period). The 
event was considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to the administration of SonoVue at both 
recordings. Twenty- three (23) subjects (0.4%) were discontinued due to adverse events, 12 of whom 
had events considered related to study agent. 
Of the 28 patients with serious adverse events, a total of 8 deaths (0.1%) were reported in all completed 
clinical studies conducted with SonoVue since 1993. All 8 deaths were considered to be unrelated to study 
agent by both the Investigators and the MAH. Deaths occurred in both cardiac and non-cardiac studies. In 
particular:

•  1 patient had procedural complications during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 1 other 
patient had procedural complications during acute ballooning of the left main artery following well-
tolerated echocardiographic exams with SonoVue; 
•  1 patient died 3 days after SonoVue administration and shortly after undergoing right hepatectomy; 
•  5 patients died 10 to 26 days after exposure to SonoVue. In none of these 5 cases did the death 
follow any reaction or complication related to the administration of SonoVue. 
In addition, 1 patient who reported 2 serious adverse events during the clinical trial, subsequently died 
outside of the protocol-defined adverse event reporting window, and are, therefore, not included in the 
integrated safety database as a death. One other death was reported in the completed clinical studies for 
a patient who died of acute myocardial infarction before receiving SonoVue. As this was a pre-dose event, 
this patient is also not included in the integrated safety database as a death. 
Further details about the deaths, including a narrative summary for each of the patients who died after 
receiving at least one administration of SonoVue during a study are provided in the Summary of Clinical 
Safety, Section 2.7.4 of this CTD.

The most frequently reported adverse event was headache (132 subjects, 2.1%), followed by nausea (54 
subjects, 0.9%), chest pain (48 subjects, 0.8%), and chest discomfort (31 subjects, 0.5%).  All other 
adverse events occurred at a frequency of <0.5%. 
A complete presentation of the adverse events that were reported in the completed studies (Healthy 
Volunteer and Patient populations) is provided in the Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 2.7.4 of this 
CTD. 
Overall MAH’s Conclusions from Clinical Trials 
SonoVue has been shown to be safe and well tolerated with minimal risk to patients. 
In clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse events was relatively low (10.7% overall, 5.2% 
investigational product-related) in subjects receiving SonoVue. The most frequently reported adverse 
events were headache (2.1%), nausea (0.9%), chest pain (0.8%), and chest discomfort (0.5%).  All 
other adverse events occurred at a frequency of <0.5%. Most adverse events were mild and resolved 
spontaneously within a short time without sequelae. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.43% of 
patients and only 0.08% of events were considered to be of some relationship to the administration of 
SonoVue (probable, possible, or unlikely). No product- related deaths were reported within MAH-
sponsored trials. 
The overall incidence of adverse events and the type of most frequently reported adverse events is 
similar among SonoVue, Optison and Luminity. 
2) Post-marketing Surveillance 
Exposure 
SonoVue is currently approved for intravenous use in 36 countries throughout the world and is marketed 
in 25 countries, indicated for use with echocardiography to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and 
enhance left ventricular endocardial border delineation, Doppler of macrovasculature, and Doppler of 
microvasculature. 
SonoVue should be administered using a 5-mL single vial per investigation (doses: 2.0 mL for endocardial 
border detection or 2.4 mL for Doppler sonography of vessels, repeated once if necessary). An estimate 
of patient exposure is thus calculated on the basis of the number of single dose vials sold from 01 April 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014

2001 to 31 December 2012. Denominators are estimated from sales statistics, with each unit sold 
representing a patient exposed to the agent. 
During market use (01 April 2001 through 31 December 2012), an estimated 2,447,083 patients have 
been exposed to SonoVue. 
Adverse Reactions 
Of the estimated 2,447,083 patients exposed to SonoVue during the market use of the product, adverse 
events for which both Reporter and MAH causality assessments did not exclude causal relationship to the 
administration of SonoVue were spontaneously reported for 719 cases (reporting rate: 0.0294%). A total 
of 322 cases (reporting rate: 0.0132%) of the 719 cases were classified as serious and 397 non-serious 
(reporting rate: 0.0162%). Adverse reactions (causality could not be ruled out by either the Reporter or 
MAH) were reported in 702 cases (reporting rate: 0.0287%), of which 307 were serious (reporting rate: 
0.0126%) and 395 were non-serious (reporting rate: 0.0161%).

Data source: post-marketing surveillance database. 
The total number of subjects with serious adverse events distributed in the last 11.5 years of marketing 
of SonoVue, with the exception of those events where both Reporter and the MAH excluded the causality 
relationship to the administration of SonoVue. The SonoVue serious cases reporting rate per year through 
31 December 2012 remains low (ranging from 0.0110% to 0.0196%) and stable across the last 11.5 
years of Pharmacovigilance surveillance. This by-quarter analysis excludes the first 6 months of 
marketing [01 April 2001 to 30 September 2001], during which only 470 patients were exposed to 
SonoVue; in this period 2 adverse reaction case reports were received, 1 serious case and 1 non-serious 
case. 
Serious Cases with Allergy-like Reactions 
Of the 307 patients reporting serious reactions, 176 (57%) were diagnosed by the initial reporter as 
allergy-like (e.g., anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity) reactions. 
According to a systematic review of the serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports performed by the 
MAH, an additional 53 ADR cases should be medically classified as allergy-like events. 
Therefore, a total of 229 out of 307 patients with serious ADRs had an allergy-like reaction and the 
overall incidence of serious allergic reactions is estimated to be in the order of 1:10,000 exposed to 
SonoVue as of 31 December 2012. In most cases allergy-like events presented an onset within a few 
minutes from the injection of the product. 
In 53 of the 229 serious allergy-like reactions, hypotension (preferred terms: hypotension, blood pressure 
decrease, blood pressure immeasurable, syncope, presyncope, circulatory collapse, and pulse pressure 
decrease) was reported at the onset of the allergy-like reaction. The severity of hypotension could range 
from a reduction of a few mmHg in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure to non-
measurable levels. 
The overall incidence of serious allergic reactions is estimated to be in the order of 1:10,000 exposed to 
SonoVue as of 31 December 2012. In most cases allergy-like events presented an onset within a few 
minutes from the injection of the product. 
Serious Cardiac Reactions 
A total of 94 patients experienced 106 cardiac-related ADRs during the post-marketing surveillance period 
of 01 April 2001 to 31 December 2012. Of these 94 patients, 77 patients (0.0031% of exposed patients) 
experienced serious cardiac-related adverse reactions. After a medical review of all PTs in the remaining 
serious cases, an additional 41 ADR cases (preferred terms: blood pressure decreased, blood pressure 
immeasurable, electrocardiogram ST segment elevation, heart rate decreased, pulse abnormal pulse 
absent, pulse pressure decreased, hypotension, shock, and circulatory collapse) were included in the 
count of serious cardiac- related cases for a total of 118 patients. Seventy-one (71) of these cases 
(60.2%) were associated with allergy-like/anaphylactoid reactions.

Reporting Rate of Serious Cardiac-Related Adverse Drug Reactions in the Last 
11.5 Years of SonoVue Marketing 
During the post-marketing surveillance period of 01 April 2001 to 31 December 2012, a total of 118 
patients (0.0048% of exposed patients) experienced serious cardiac-related adverse reactions. Seventy-
one (71) of these cases (60.2%) were associated with allergy-like/anaphylactoid reactions. 
Post-marketing Surveillance Death Cases 
Of the 2,447,083 patients exposed to SonoVue during the market use of the product (01 April 2001 to 31 
December 2012, the data cut-off for this document), 11 cases of fatal outcome have been reported 
(reporting rate: 0.0004%, a figure that compares favourably with the risk for fatal events reported for 
iodinated contrast agents that is approximately 0.001% to 0.003%). The association with the 
administration of SonoVue could not be ruled out in 9 of the 11 cases, whereas there was no relation to 
SonoVue reported for the remaining 2 cases. In all death cases, the poor underlying conditions of the 
patients played a major role in the fatal outcome: 6 patients had severe underlying CAD with ongoing or 
recent acute myocardial infarction, and history of multiple coronary interventions and left ventricular 
dysfunction; 1 patient had limited information on his cardiac condition except an apical left ventricular 
thrombus, which is often associated with myocardial infarction and is a condition characterized by 
substantial mortality rate; 3 patients had advanced stage cancer; 1 patient was a long-term smoker with 
a history of hypertension who shortly before SonoVue exposure was having a fever and was suspected to 
have liver abscesses with significantly elevated alpha fetoprotein and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. 
In addition to these 11 patients, 2 other patients experienced unrelated serious adverse events of after 
the administration of SonoVue and subsequently died, and 1 other patient who experienced a serious 
adverse event of anaphylactoid shock with recovered / resolved outcome, considered to be related to the 
administration of SonoVue, and subsequently died almost 7 weeks later due to their underlying cardiac 
disease.

MAH’s Comparison of Post-marketing Surveillance amongst the 3 USCAs 
In post-marketing surveillance data collected from 2001 to 2012, with close to 2,447,083 patients 
exposed, the reporting rate of serious adverse events for SonoVue is approximately 1 in 10,000 
exposures and is comparable to that of Optison and Luminity. No major trends or significant changes in 
the reporting rate of serious adverse events have been observed over time. Comparison of post-
marketing surveillance data gathered in the period 2008-2010 show similar reporting rates among the 
three approved USCAs.

MAH’s Conclusions from Post-Marketing Surveillance 
Experience from post-marketing surveillance of the estimated 2,447,083 patients exposed to SonoVue 
from 01 April 2001 through 31 December 2012 during the market use of this product shows: 
-  A total of 307 cases of serious adverse reactions (reporting rate: 0.0126%) considered to be related to 
the administration of SonoVue; 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014 
Page 17/33 
 
 
 
  
  
-  The observed pattern of serious adverse event cases possibly related to the administration of SonoVue 
is similar to that reported for anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions to other intravascular imaging 
agents; 
-  Serious hypersensitivity reactions are observed in approx. 1 in 10,000 exposures; 
-  The overall reporting rate of fatal cases during SonoVue market use is very low (14/2,447,083 exposed 
patients; 0.0006%) and favourably comparable with the risk for fatal events reported for iodinated 
contrast agents (approximately 0.001%); 
MAH’s Comparison of Adverse Reactions Reported for the 3 USCAs 
It has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies of the 3 registered USCAs that cardiovascular risk 
with the use of USCAs is not expected to depend on predictable adverse reactions to any of the individual 
components or the composition of the agents. 
Table below displays overall incidence rates in clinical trials for the 3 products available to date. SonoVue 
has been studied in more patients and has a lower percentage of patients reporting adverse events, and a 
lower rate of adverse events where the causal relationship to the investigational product could not be 
ruled out.

3) Retrospective Epidemiological Studies 
Retrospective Epidemiological Study BR1-132 in SonoVue 
SonoVue Study BR1-132 was a retrospective analysis investigating in-hospital mortality (within the same 
day as or the calendar day following performance of the echocardiography procedure) rate in 757 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014 
Page 18/33 
 
 
 
 
  
  
critically ill patients receiving echocardiography with the administration of SonoVue in comparison with 
3087 patients receiving echocardiography without contrast agent.  
Patients hospitalized from 01 September 2001 to 31 May 2010 meeting the following inclusion criteria 
were enrolled in the study: male or female at least 18 years of age at the time the rest- only 
echocardiography was performed; defined as critically ill according to at least one of the unstable 
cardiopulmonary conditions listed as the admitting diagnosis (i.e., worsening or clinically unstable heart 
failure [Class III/IV], recent ACS or clinically unstable ischemic cardiac disease, recent coronary artery 
intervention within 7 days prior to the echocardiogram, severe rhythm disorders, other factors suggesting 
clinical instability, severe pulmonary hypertension [pulmonary artery pressure >90 mmHg], adult 
respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], emphysema and/or COPD, other [each site was to specify from 
the patient’s medical history]); source medical records for primary clinical data were available and 
accessible; patients undergoing echocardiography with administration of SonoVue or without 
administration of any contrast agent; and echocardiography examination performed within 7 days from 
admission to the hospital for the unstable cardiopulmonary condition. 
Data from participating sites were abstracted by Investigator/Site personnel and included patient 
elements such as age, gender, race, admitting diagnosis, treatment received (i.e., contrast agent), and 
mortality status. The primary study variable was in-hospital mortality (within the same day of 
echocardiography procedure and/or the following calendar day).  The secondary study variables included 
patient demographic, baseline characteristics, co-morbidity conditions, and other risk factors. 
Univariate Analysis 
The incidences of in-hospital mortality were estimated for each study group. The crude odds ratio with 
the 95% CI for comparison of in-hospital mortality between the 2 groups was derived from univariate 
logistic regression model. The p-value from Wald chi-square test of logistic regression analysis was 
presented comparing the incidence of in-hospital mortality between the 2 groups. 
Of the 3844 critically ill patients who met all of the eligible criteria for the study, 53 (1.38%) were 
included in the in-hospital mortality count as having died the same day as the echocardiography 
procedure and/or the following calendar day. Among the 53 patients, 48 (48/3087 patients, 1.55%) had 
undergone unenhanced echocardiography examination, and 5 (5/757, 0.66%) had undergone a SonoVue-
enhanced echocardiography examination. There was no statistical difference between these 2 groups 
(p=0.067). The estimated crude odds ratio comparing the SonoVue Group with the Control Group was 
0.42 with 95% CI 0.17 - 1.06. 
Propensity Score Matched Analysis 
This was a non-randomized observational study, therefore, the distribution of patient baseline 
characteristics and risk factors were likely to vary systematically between the SonoVue and Control 
groups since assignment of study group was not randomly assigned but rather passively observed. 
Propensity score matching method was used to control for the imbalance in observable covariates 
between the 2 study groups and thus to reduce potential biases due to confounding factors in the 
estimation of treatment effect on the same day or next day mortality among study populations. The 
intent of propensity analysis was to mimic the conditions of a randomized trial such that patients were 
similar in every measurable respect except for treatment (SonoVue or Control) allocation. 
The first step was to calculate the propensity score for each patient from the logistic equation. Propensity 
score was the probability that each patient would get SonoVue-enhanced echocardiography and this 
probability was predicted using the following stepwise multivariate logistic regression model that included 
all observed variables from demographic, baseline characteristics, co-morbid conditions, risk factors, and 
hospital status. Covariates considered with best predictive power in the model for propensity score were: 
age, gender, admission to ER, CCU, respiratory distress syndrome, coronary syndrome, pulmonary heart

disorder, recent coronary artery intervention, severe rhythm disorder, worsening heart failure, anti-
coagulant treatment, dyslipidemia, and muscular-skeletal disorder. 
Control patients who met inclusion criteria were used as the control base for matching the SonoVue 
patients. For each SonoVue patient, 1 matched control patient will be assigned who showed the smallest 
difference in propensity scores using nearest neighbor matching method with greedy-matching algorithm. 
To compare in-hospital same day and/or the following calendar day mortality between matched SonoVue 
and Control patients, a conditional logistic regression model was applied to estimate treatment effects. 
Propensity score was included in the final conditional logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratio was 
estimated along with 95% confidence intervals presented. 
The propensity score matching procedure had more than 80% of SonoVue patients (615/757 patients) 
who could be matched 1-to-1 with Control patients based on their closest baseline risk status. Covariates 
considered with best predictive power in the model for propensity score were: age, gender, admission to 
Emergency Room, Cardiac Care Unit (CCU), ARDS, coronary syndrome, pulmonary heart disorder, recent 
coronary artery intervention, severe rhythm disorder, worsening heart failure, anti-coagulant treatment, 
dyslipidemia, and muscular-skeletal disorder. 
The overall similarity of the clinically important predictors indicates that the 2 groups were balanced after 
propensity score matching. Thus the analysis based on the matched subjects reduced potential 
confounding effect bias. 
The propensity score matched analysis had comparable results to the univariate analysis. Of those 615 
patients who had undergone unenhanced echocardiography, 10 (1.63%) died within the same day as the 
echocardiography procedure and/or the following calendar day. Of the 615 patients receiving SonoVue 
during echocardiogram, 5 (0.81%) died the same day as the echocardiography procedure and/or the 
following calendar day. There was no statistical difference between these 2 groups (p=0.068). The 
estimated adjusted odds ratio comparing the SonoVue Group with the Control Group was 0.30 with 95% 
CI 0.08 - 1.09. 
Composite Endpoint of Mortality and Major Adverse Events 
Adverse events were collected whenever such information was available in patients’ medical records. For 
the purpose of this retrospective study, an adverse event was defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence reported in the patient’s medical records which had occurred immediately after the start of the 
echocardiography within the same day of echocardiography procedure and/or the following calendar day.  
Any untoward medical occurrence that occurred outside of this period was not collected. 
A blinded medical review of all major adverse events was performed by 2 physicians to confirm major 
events of interest (e.g., new major cardiac events, worsening of cardiac condition, and hypersensitivity 
reactions). Major adverse events were identified as: 
-  Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactoid reaction 
-  Hypotension 
-  Chest Pain 
-  Acute MI 
-  Cardiac Arrhythmia requiring intervention and including: 
-  Third degree atrioventricular block 
-  Frequent multifocal R on T PVCs 
-  Bigeminy PVCs

-  Sustained and non –sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) 
-  Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) 
-  Q-T prolongation 
-  New onset of Atrial Fibrillation 
-  Severe Bradycardia 
-  Cardiac arrest 
-  Pulmonary embolism 
The incidences of death and major adverse events were estimated for each study group. The crude odds 
ratio with the 95% CI for comparison between the 2 groups was presented and the difference between 2 
groups was tested by Fishers Exact test. There was also no significant difference between the SonoVue 
Group versus the Control Group with respect to combined mortality and major adverse events in critically 
ill patients. 
Retrospective Epidemiological Studies of Other Contrast Agent Use in Critically ill Patients 
Retrospective epidemiological studies in critically ill patients have also been conducted for the other 2 
USCAs using a propensity-matched database. A comparison of the methods used amongst the 3 products 
is presented in Table below. The results were the same across all 3 studies: no increased risk of mortality 
was observed for patients undergoing echocardiography with a contrast agent compared with those 
undergoing unenhanced echocardiography.

Literature Review: Studies of the Safety and Effectiveness of USCAs in the Critically Ill 
Population 
With the current contraindications imposed on the use of SonoVue in the critically ill patient population, 
little to no evidence of its safety and effectiveness is available in published scientific literature. However, 
an extensive literature search was performed identifying additional retrospective and prospective studies 
with SonoVue and other USCAs published during the time period of 01 January 1996 to 31 December 
2012 that confirmed and extended the safety findings in the critically ill patient population. This search 
was performed utilizing PubMed, a service of the US National Library of Medicine, Medline, CancerLit, 
Derwent Drug File, Biosys Preview, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Embase, Biobase, Biological 
Abstracts, CAB Abstracts, CSA Life Science Abstracts, Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, and 
the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The search was conducted using the following key terms: 
(SonoVue OR Sulfur hexafluoride OR sulphur hexafluoride OR BR1 OR BR-1 OR Definity OR Optison OR 
perflutren OR ultrasound* OR ultrason* OR ultrasound contrast agent) AND (echocardio* OR cardiac 
disease OR critically ill patients OR acute coronary syndrome OR clinically unstable ischemic cardiac 
disease OR AMI OR myocardial infarct* OR acute cardiac failure OR typical angina at rest within last 7 
days OR coronary artery intervention OR PTCA OR cardiac ablation OR class III/IV cardiac failure OR class 
III cardiac failure OR class IV cardiac failure OR ventricular remodeling OR ventricular arrhythmia OR 
severe emphysema OR pulmonary emboli OR severe pulmonary hypertension OR adult respiratory 
distress syndrome OR respiratory failure OR apical thrombus OR unstable angina OR intensive care unit 
OR ICU OR cardiac care unit OR CCU). The search was limited to “human”. No other limits were applied. 
A total of 752 unique references were identified in the search results. All articles identified in the search 
were reviewed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

Gaibazzi et al conducted a single-center retrospective study of the safety of SonoVue in contrast-flash 
replenishment dipyrimadole-atropine (DASE) in 500 Emergency Department patients with chest pain but 
with normal ECGs and troponin I levels. The interval between the chest pain event and the DASE 
procedure was <5 days. Adverse were recorded during and immediately after DASE and at a 24-hour 
follow-up with each patient. The possible presence of arrhythmia after DASE was specifically determined 
by reviewing the following data sources for each patient: 12-lead ECG data acquired during each stage of 
the stress protocol, all the digitally- stored flash-replenishment clips, and the real-time ECG on the echo 
monitor during the DASE procedure. Adverse events were compared with an historical control group of 
500 patients who received DASE within the preceding year in which contrast was not used; in this group, 
the interval between the event of chest pain and the DASE procedure was up to 5 days. 
No fatalities, myocardial infarction, or acute coronary syndromes and no study-related severe AEs were 
reported during the DASE procedure or during the 24 hour follow-up. Troponin I did not rise to above 
normal level for any patient in the subgroup tested (n=95). All AEs were mild or moderate and self-
limiting or promptly resolving after aminophylline administration or with atropine administration (for 
vagal reaction). Common AEs (reported in >1% of patients) included mild headache and dry mouth 
(common side effects of dipyrimadole-atropine), premature ventricular complexes, vasovagal reaction 
without loss of consciousness, and supraventricular premature beats. Uncommon AEs (reported in >1% 
of patients) were hypotension, atrial fibrillation/flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, fatigue, non-
sustained ventricular tachycardia (1 patient), second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block; left bundle 
branch block, vomiting, and pain at injection site. There were no significantly differences between the 
SonoVue and the control group in AEs. However, the authors stated that the need to use an historical 
group for control patients was a limitation of the study. 
Kuznetsky et al studied acute mortality in a total of 18,671 hospitalized patients who underwent clinically 
indicated transthoracic echocardiographic examination with or without the use of a contrast agent 
(Definity). Incidence of death within 24 hours was compared by chi- square test between the contrast-
enhanced and unenhanced procedures. The vital status within 24 hours of each echocardiogram was 
obtained retrospectively from medical records and the Social Security Death Master File. Of the 18,671 
patients, 12,475 patients had undergone unenhanced echo, and 6,196 had undergone contrast-enhanced 
echocardiogram. Results indicated that there were 72 deaths reported within 24 hours in the total patient 
population of 18,671. Of the 72 deaths, 46 (0.37%; 46/12,475 patients) were in the group of patients

echocardiograms without contrast, and 26 deaths (0.42%; 26/6196 patients) were among the patients in 
the contrast group. There were no deaths within 1 hour of echocardiogram. There was no statistical 
difference between the 2 groups.  In addition, the authors discovered that in a random sampling from 
both groups, patients who underwent contrast enhanced studies exhibited higher clinical acuity and more 
significant comorbidities. In conclusion, this study indicated that there was no increased mortality risk 
associated with Definity-enhanced echocardiographic examination in hospitalized patients, despite 
evidence for higher clinical acuity and more comorbid conditions in patients undergoing contrast-
enhanced studies. 
In a multicenter retrospective study, Wei et al demonstrated the incidence of severe adverse events 
following exposure to USCAs during echocardiographic examination. The data were derived from a total of 
66,164 doses of Definity and 12,219 doses of Optison with rest and stress echocardiographic procedures 
during a period of 4.5+2.4 years. More than 10,000 doses of contrast were used in patients with acute 
chest pain of suspected cardiac origin or critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. A total 
of 8 serious reactions were reported as being probably related to Definity, 4 of which were consistent with 
anaphylactic reactions. All of the severe reactions occurred in outpatients. No deaths were reported. The 
limitation of the study was the adverse events were reported not under research protocols with a 
systematic approach, but as part of routine clinical care. It is unlikely that severe adverse events were 
missed, but mild symptoms may have gone unreported. This study demonstrated that the USCAs during 
echocardiography have a good safety profile in a large number of patients evaluated in a wide variety of 
settings including the critically ill. 
A comparison of mortality in critically ill hospitalized patients undergoing echocardiography with and 
without USCA has been reported in a retrospective multi-center study by Exuzides et al.7 A total of 
2,588,722 patients who underwent echocardiographic exam were identified by a hospital service-level 
database of which 22,499 received Optison during echocardiography. Of the 22,499 patients, only 2,900 
of them met the critically ill criteria which included the patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and 
emphysema.  Comorbidities, demographic factors, levels of care, mechanical ventilation status were used 
as variables in constructing the propensity score matching to control the differences between the critically 
ill patients who underwent echocardiography with or without contrast. Critically ill patients who 
underwent contrast- enhanced echocardiography were matched to 4 control patients who underwent an 
echocardiographic exam without contrast. Before matching, contrast patients showed greater morbidity 
than non-contrast patients (Deyo-modified Charlson comorbidity index score 2.45 vs.2.25, p<0.0001). 
These differences significantly were reduced following the prosperity score matching as an indicator of 
well-balanced groups. 
The primary outcome for this study was all-cause, same–day mortality, the secondary outcome was all-
cause, same-day or next day mortality. A total of 2,900 critically ill patients with contrast enhanced 
echocardiography were compared to 11,600 patients with non-contrast echocardiography as a control 
group. There were 167 same-day deaths in the study, 38 from the contrast group and 129 from the 
control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the contrast patients and the 
matched control patients for same day all-cause mortality (adjusted odd ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.71; 
p=0.37). There was 267 same day or next day deaths in the study, 62 from the contrast group and 205 
from the control group.  No statistical difference was found between the contrast and matched control 
groups for same-day or next day all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.64; 
p=0.18). 
Furthermore, the same day mortality was compared between the contrast group and non-contrast control 
matched in three different subgroups: patients who had mechanical ventilation, ICU patients without 
mechanical ventilation and CCU patients without mechanical ventilation. None of the sub-groups showed 
a statistically significant difference in same-day mortality. There were 108 same-day deaths in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014 
Page 25/33 
  
  
mechanical ventilation subgroup, 22 in the contrast group and 86 in the non-contrast control group 
reported (adjusted odds ratio: 0.83, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.42; p=0.51). 
There were 30 same-day deaths in the ICU subgroup, 9 in the contrast and 21 in the non-contrast control 
group (adjusted odds ratio: 2.168, 95% CI 0.89 to 5.27; p=0.09). 
In the CCU subgroup, 3 patients in the contrast group and 8 in the non-contrast control group totaling up 
to 11 same-day deaths were reported (adjusted odds ratio: 1.42, 95% CI 0.38 to 5.36; p=0.61). 
The study had some limitations. It was an observational study and treatment selection was non-random. 
The discrete time of death was not available in the Premier database, only the day of death was recorded. 
Overall, there were no statistical differences identified in same-day or next day mortality in the critically 
ill patients who underwent echocardiography with contrast versus patients who did not receive contrast. 
These findings were also confirmed in higher risk patient subgroups as the patients in ICU’s, CCU’s and 
patients who have mechanical ventilation. In critically ill patients undergoing echo with contrast, there 
was no increase in mortality compared with case-matched control patients who had echocardiographic 
exam without contrast. 
Abdelmonemin et al addressed the safety of USCA use during stress echocardiography in patients with 
increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) as determined by the peak tricuspid regurgitant 
velocity. A total of 16,434 patients who had RVSP measured at rest to evaluate the safety of contrast in 
patients with pulmonary hypertension have been studied. Of those, 6164 patients (39% had exercise 
echo and 61% had dobutamine stress echo) have received contrast (Optison and Definity) for left 
ventricular opacification and the remaining 10,270 (60% exercise echo, and 40 % had dobutamine stress 
echo) did not receive contrast. The primary outcome of the study was the short term safety (<72 hours 
and <30 days) of the contrast agents that were given to the patients with elevated RVSP during 
echocardiographic examination. End points analysed were death (all-cause mortality) and myocardial 
infarction. The secondary outcome of the study was the long term safety of contrast agent use and the 
time to the event (death or myocardial infarction). In addition, all the documented adverse effects related 
to contrast agents and arrhythmias were reported. Analysis was done for resting RVSP with cut points of 
>35, >50 and >60 mmHg and tricuspid regurgitation velocities with cut points of >2.7 and >3.5 ms-1, 
respectively. Contrast agent related adverse events only occurred in 0.98% (less than 1%) of patients. 
There were no significant differences were found between the contrast and non-contrast cohorts with 
respect to short term events in patients with RVSP >50 mmHg. Similarly, there were no significant 
differences between contrasts vs. non-contrast cohort for long term events. Furthermore, similar results 
were obtained with different RVSP and tricuspid regurgitation cut points. 
This retrospective cohort study addressed the safety of USCA use during stress echocardiographic 
examination in patients with increased RVSP as determined by resting tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity. 
There were no differences in rates for death and myocardial infarct in the group who had undergone 
echocardiographic exam with contrast compared with those who had not received contrast, despite a 
higher incidence of clinical comorbidities in the contrast cohort. In conclusion, the use of contrast agents 
during echocardiography in patients with elevated RVSP was not associated with increased short term or 
long term rates of death or myocardial infarction. 
Similarly, Gabriel et al also studied the safety of contrast agents (Optison and Definity) during 
echocardiography in patients with pulmonary hypertension. An accurate measurement of RVSP from 
contrast enhanced tricuspid regurgitation velocity was obtained in 3479 (35%) of total of 10,010 patients 
who had received contrast during echocardiographic exam. Mild pulmonary hypertension was documented 
in 1921 patients, and 346 patients had severe pulmonary hypertension. Within 24 hours of contrast 
administration, there was no documented cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis or sustained ventricular arrhythmia 
noted. Overall, in a total of 2267 patients with documented pulmonary hypertension who received USCAs 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014

during echocardiography, no serious adverse events were noted. This study confirms the safety of 
ultrasound contrast use during echocardiography in patients with pulmonary hypertension. 
Main et al studied retrospectively the safety of contrast agent use during echocardiography among 
critically ill patients including those who were mechanically ventilated in ICU setting. Of the 39,189 
critically ill patients who had echocardiograms performed while in the ICU, 19,318 received contrast 
(Definity and Optison) and 19,871 did not. Short term mortality (<48 hours) rates were 2.98% in 
patients who had an echo without contrast, and 2.3% for patients who had echo with contrast. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that short term mortality among critically ill patients was 
23% less in patients who had received contrast. This multicenter retrospective large cohort study results 
have confirmed that transthoracic echocardiography with contrast is associated with higher 48-hour 
survival in critically ill patients in ICUs. 
Further, Main et al assessed the short term (one day) mortality in a large multicenter cohort of 
hospitalized patients undergoing clinically indicated echocardiography with and without contrast agent.  In 
this observational retrospective study, consecutive 4,300,966 patients who had undergone transthoracic 
rest echocardiogram were selected from United States hospitals participating in the Premier Perspective 
database. Of those 4,300,966 patients, 4,242,712 had echocardiography without contrast and remaining 
58,254 with contrast.  Mortality rates were 1.08% (45,789 of 4,242,712) for patients undergoing non-
contrast studies and 1.06% (616 of 58,254) for patients undergoing contrast (Definity) enhanced 
echocardiography. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to 
mortality rate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed patients who had received contrast during 
echocardiography were 24% less likely to die within one day than patients who had not received contrast 
(adjusted odd ratio: 0.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.82). 
MAH’s Overall Conclusions from Retrospective Epidemiological Studies 
The results of Study BR1-132 indicated that there was no statistically significant difference noted between 
critically ill patients who had undergone contrast echocardiography with SonoVue and critically ill patients 
who had undergone echocardiography without the use of a contrast agent with respect to in-hospital 
mortality (i.e., within the same day of echocardiography procedure and/or the following calendar day). 
The comparison among the 3 USCAs revealed that same-day and next-day mortality rates for contrast-
enhanced echocardiography were either lower (SonoVue and Luminity) than or comparable (Optison) to 
that for non-contrast echocardiography. 
The published literature confirms the safe use of contrast in critically ill patients (including but not limited 
to ACS, AMI, and severe pulmonary hypertension) as there were no statistically significant differences 
observed between those administered contrast and those not.

Risk management plan 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  Risk  Management  Plan  (version  8,  dated  05  March  2014)  in  the 
context  of  the  type  II-25  variation.  In  this  procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  delete  the 
contraindications for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac 
disease in Section 4.3 and the insertion of these patient populations into Section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions  for  use,  with  editing  of  the  wording  as  appropriate.  These  changes  are  also  reflected  in 
revised wording for the PIL. The CHMP recommended the submission of an amended RMP and educational 
material accordingly to the proposed changes of Section 4.3 and 4.4 of the SPC.  
The RMP version 8 also includes changes requested by PRAC Rapporteur from preliminary PSUR No. 17 
(covering the period between 01 Oct 2012 to 30 Sep 2013) and RMP version 7 Assessment report. Off-
label use of Sonovue in the adult population has been removed from the important potential risk 
category. Although the MAH is continuing to monitor the off-label use of SonoVue, the risk minimisation 
measures are now more specifically directed to anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions in patients receiving 
SonoVue, including patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac 
disease 
2.4.3. Discussion 
Although there are differences in the pharmaceutical composition of the three USCAs approved in the EU, 
the safety and efficacy profile of these three products is very similar, as demonstrated by clinical and 
post-marketing surveillance data. SonoVue efficacy and safety is based on data from 75 clinical trials in 
6307 subjects and post-marketing surveillance over 11.5 years of market use in an estimated 2.45 
million patients. Hypersensitivity to any of the components of SonoVue, cannot be excluded, and there is 
potential for unpredictable, serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions. Further, 
such reactions may lead to life-threatening conditions if they occur in critically ill patients. However, 
serious hypersensitivity reactions after SonoVue administration are rare (estimated occurrence of approx.

1 in 10,000 exposures) and suboptimal EBD and inaccurate assessment of LV function (global and 
regional wall motion assessment) and/or cardiac anatomy are frequent in this patient population. This 
may severely limit the diagnostic performance of TTE, the imaging modality that represents a 
fundamental investigation used in the initial and on-going management of patients in the critical care 
setting because it is non-invasive, provides easy access, anytime and any day, can be performed at the 
bedside of the patient, and can be repeated as often as needed for monitoring. The balance of benefit of 
SonoVue use compared with its risks is also positively affected by the availability of acute care skills and 
settings that can promptly and effectively recognize and manage serious adverse events. 
Among critically ill patients, significant difficulties may limit optimal TTE imaging due to the complex and 
dynamic profile of critically ill patients in the ICU and emergency department. Many will be unable to 
assume an optimal position for imaging due to pain or inability to cooperate. Mechanical ventilation, lung 
disease, subcutaneous emphysema, surgical incisions, chest tubes and bandages are relatively common 
during critical illness and the percentage of suboptimal examinations in critically ill patients is reported to 
be at least twice that in the overall population referred for TTE.  
Although optional non-invasive modalities (SPECT, MRI, CT angiography) may provide diagnostic 
accuracy and valuable and detailed data, all pose greater risk than TTE. Probably the most critical 
drawback is the time delay in obtaining the data needed for urgent risk assessment and treatment, but 
safety concerns including exposure to radioactive material and risky patient transportation to the 
nuclear/magnetic imaging department are also present. Further, if an imaging agent is used, these 
imaging modalities carry the same risk of rare, serious hypersensitivity reactions and the same risk of 
serious, life-threatening complications. 
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is another optional procedure and, like TTE, it provides high 
accuracy real-time bedside data. But TEE is an invasive technique, introducing significant risks associated 
with anaesthesia and manipulation of the inserted probe as well as certain imaging limitations. 
As a result, TTE is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in critical care 
settings and both EAE and ASE guidelines recommend the use of ultrasound contrast in ICU patients with 
suboptimal endocardial border delineation. Clinical studies and wide post- marketing use of SonoVue have 
categorically demonstrated its significant benefit in enabling accurate LV volumes and LVEF in patients 
with suboptimal non contrast images, including critically ill patients. 
Conversion of suboptimal to optimal LV images translates to more efficient patient management including 
a reduction in the need for additional diagnostic procedures, unnecessary hospital admissions and more 
effective treatment regimens administered more expeditiously and can predict possible post-admission 
complications in these patients. Further, an accurate assessment of LV structure and function in these 
patients has additional prognostic value, which allows more accurate triage for preventive treatment for 
post-event complications. Hypersensitivity reactions were observed in SonoVue, including potentially 
serious anaphylactoid reactions, may be life threatening, the healthcare professional must be warned 
about the occurrence of these rare events.  
The applicant provided a comprehensive review of available clinical safety data derived from 6 clinical 
pharmacology studies, 75 clinical trials in which 6307 subjects received Sonovue, post-marketing 
surveillance and retrospective epidemiological studies including 8 publications focused on the safe use of 
USCAs in the critically ill patient population. 
Data from post-marketing surveillance (from 1 April 2001 to 31 December 2012 with an estimated 
number of patients of 2,447,083) indicated that a total of 118 patients (0.0048% of exposed patients) 
experienced serious cardiac-related adverse reactions. Seventy-one (71) of these cases (60.2%) were 
associated with allergy-like/anaphylactoid reactions. The overall incidence of serious allergic reactions is 
estimated to be in the order of 1:10,000 exposed to SonoVue as of 31 December 2012. In most cases 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014 
Page 30/33 
  
  
allergy-like events presented an onset within a few minutes from the injection of the product. Eleven 
cases of fatal outcome have been reported. The association with the administration of SonoVue could not 
be ruled out in 9 of the 11 cases. In all death cases, the poor underlying conditions of the patients played 
a major role in the fatal outcome: 6 patients had severe underlying CAD with on-going or recent acute 
myocardial infarction, and history of multiple coronary interventions and left ventricular dysfunction; 1 
patient had limited information on his cardiac condition except an apical left ventricular thrombus, which 
is often associated with myocardial infarction and is a condition characterized by substantial mortality 
rate; 3 patients had advanced stage cancer; 1 patient was a long-term smoker with a history of 
hypertension who shortly before SonoVue exposure was having a fever and was suspected to have liver 
abscesses with significantly elevated alpha fetoprotein and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. 
In this post-marketing surveillance data, the reporting rate of serious adverse events for SonoVue is 
approximately 1 in 10,000 exposures and is comparable to that of Optison and Luminity. No major trends 
or significant changes in the reporting rate of serious adverse events have been observed over time. 
Comparison of post-marketing surveillance data gathered in the period 2008-2010 show similar reporting 
rates among the three approved USCAs. 
SonoVue is the only ultrasound contrast agent approved for use in stress echocardiography, i.e., in 
conjunction with the use of pharmacological stressors like dobutamine, a cardiac inotrope and 
chronotrope that increases heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, or dipyridamole, a vasodilator that 
increases blood velocity and flow rate in normal vessels and less of a response in stenotic vessels. Both 
types of stressors induce local myocardial ischemia in CAD patients that may be visible on the 
echocardiogram as a regional wall motion abnormality. To accurately detect wall motion abnormalities, 
proper visualization of entire endocardium for every vessel territory, with complete delineation of the 
endocardial border, is critical for the detection and assessment of coronary artery disease. 
Based on the information received from the reporters, four out of the 5 observed cases of severe cardiac 
arrhythmia did not occur in patients with any of the conditions in which current use of SonoVue is 
contraindicated, i.e., evolving or on-going myocardial infarction, typical angina at rest within last 7 days, 
significant worsening of cardiac symptoms within last 7 days, recent coronary artery intervention or other 
factors suggesting clinical instability (for example, recent deterioration of ECG, laboratory or clinical 
findings), acute cardiac failure, or severe rhythm disorders. Only in one case, occurred in a patient with 
dilated cardiomyopathy, it is not clear whether there was one of the conditions in which the use SonoVue 
was contraindicated, i.e., class III or IV cardiac failure. However, both SonoVue and dobutamine are 
contraindicated for use in patients with severe heart failure, and the risk of complications following 
dobutamine administration in patients with severe heart failure is high. Therefore, the MAH believes this 
patient did not actually suffer from severe heart failure, even if, following the stress echocardiographic 
procedure, the patient had a rapid deterioration of her conditions and eventually died 19 days after the 
stress echocardiographic procedure.  
Of note is the fact that stress echocardiography with dobutamine is contraindicated in patients with 
conditions suggesting cardiovascular instability, such as unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial 
infarction, stenosis of the main left coronary artery, haemodynamically significant outflow obstruction of 
the left ventricle including hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, haemodynamically significant cardiac 
valvular defect, Class III/IV cardiac failure, predisposition for or documented medical history of clinically 
significant or chronic arrhythmia, particularly recurrent persistent ventricular tachycardia, significant 
disturbance in conduction, acute pericarditis, myocarditis or endocarditis, aortic dissection, aortic 
aneurysm, inadequately treated / controlled arterial hypertension, obstruction of ventricular filling 
(constrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade), hypovolaemia. Cardiologists performing pharmacologic 
stress echocardiography are well aware of the risks deriving from administration of dobutamine in 
patients with any of the conditions listed above; therefore, the MAH believes that, following the lifting of 
contraindications for SonoVue, the risk of SonoVue-enhanced stress echocardiography with dobutamine in 
Assessment report  
EMA/84084/2014

critically ill patients is not going to increase. In particular, the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmias during 
stress-echo procedures is not going to increase, as dobutamine is specifically contraindicated for use in 
patients with predisposition for or documented medical history of clinically significant or chronic 
arrhythmia.  
While contraindications are lifted from Section 4.3, the MAH proposes to introduce a specific warning in 
Section 4.4. of the SmPC of the product. This would increase prescriber’s/user’s awareness of the 
conditions for which stress echocardiography with dobutamine is contraindicated. In addition, the 
“Checklist For Good Reporting” included in the SonoVue educational material has been expanded in order 
to include a specific “cardiac form” aimed at recording information on cardiovascular history of the 
patient, cardiovascular co-morbidities, co-medications, type of echocardiography examination, and 
echocardiography findings. The aim has been broadened to inform the healthcare professionals of the 
importance of appropriately assessing the presence and recording data on patients’ cardiovascular 
history, underlying disease(s), co-medications, type of echocardiography procedure, and 
echocardiography findings. This checklist will also help identifying conditions for which the use of 
dobutamine is contraindicated.  
As for the 5 cases of severe cardiac arrhythmias in the MAH pharmacovigilance database, two (ES-
000872 and BR0-010389) were observed in the context of anaphylactic reactions, a known and rare 
occurrence reported for both SonoVue and dobutamine. Two other cases (GB-000813 and GB-000089) 
most likely occurred after the onset of a vasovagal reaction, an adverse event that could have been 
caused by a dynamic functional outflow obstruction resulting from dobutamine inotropic action or by a 
Bezold-Jarish reflex, due to excessive inotropic stimulation, especially during the early stage of 
dobutamine infusion. In the last of the 5 cases (GB-000374) there was no evidence for a contrast 
reaction and the reporter considered the ventricular fibrillation as probably related to the administration 
of dobutamine.  
As previously reported by the MAH, the concomitant use of stressors may represent an important 
confounding factor in the assessment of cases of serious adverse reactions to SonoVue in 
echocardiography. Stressors may induce predictable, dose-dependent effects on the cardiovascular 
system (e.g., increase in heart rate, blood pressure and ventricular ectopic activity for dobutamine, or 
decrease in blood pressure for adenosine and dipyridamole) as well as unpredictable, hypersensitivity 
reactions. Of note, it is known that hypersensitivity reactions may follow the administration of the 
approved pharmacological stressors. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
SonoVue is for use with ultrasound imaging to enhance the echogenicity of the blood, which results in 
an improved signal to noise ratio. SonoVue should only be used in patients where study without contrast 
enhancement is inconclusive: 
- Echocardiography: SonoVue is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in 
patients with suspected or established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac 
chambers and enhance left ventricular endocardial border delineation. 
- Doppler of macrovasculature: SonoVue increases the accuracy in detection or exclusion of 
abnormalities in cerebral arteries and extracranial carotid or peripheral arteries by improving the  
Doppler signal to noise ratio. SonoVue increases the quality of the Doppler flow image and the 
duration of clinically-useful signal enhancement in portal vein assessment.

- Doppler of microvasculature: SonoVue improves display of the vascularity of liver and breast 
lesions during Doppler sonography, leading to more specific lesion characterisation.  
The MAH proposed the update of section 4.3 of the SmPC in order to delete the contraindications for use 
in patients with acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease and to insert 
information on these patient populations into section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, with 
editing of the wording as appropriate. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. 
Based on the results of BR1-132 study, post-marketing data and the safety profile of the other UCAs 
approved in Europe, this variation for SONOVUE for the following proposed changes of 4.3 and 4.4 
sections of the SmPC is considered approvable by the CHMP. The MAH has been requested by the CHMP 
to closely monitor and provide discussion, via the next PSUR, regarding the recorded events with a 
comparison of the reporting rates specifically on the above defined high risk patient population during the 
time period when the contra-indication was in effect (2004-today) versus the time period the contra-
indication will be removed (today onwards).   
4.  Recommendations

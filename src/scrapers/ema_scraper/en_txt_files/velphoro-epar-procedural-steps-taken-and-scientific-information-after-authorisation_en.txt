in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older with 
CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration 
rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or with CKD on dialysis, 
based on the results from an open-label, 
randomised, active-controlled, parallel group, 
multicentre, phase 3 study investigating the safety 
and efficacy of Velphoro and calcium acetate in 
paediatric and adolescent CKD patients with 
hyperphosphataemia (Study PA-CL-PED-01). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and 
Labelling are updated in accordance. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. The RMP 
version 9.0 is also agreed. Furthermore, the PI is 
brought in line with the latest QRD template version 
10.1.

SmPC 
The SmPC section 5.1 is updated with post-authorisation 
information related to the results of the VERIFIE 
study. This was a non-interventional voluntary PASS 
trial, which aimed to investigate the short and long-
term real-life safety, effectiveness, and adherence of 
data in adult patients on haemodialysis (n=1,198) or 
peritoneal dialysis (n=160), who were followed in routine 
clinical practice for 12 to 36 months (safety analysis set, 
N=1,365). In the safety analysis set, the most common

Velphoro in patients with CKD and 
hyperphosphatemia undergoing haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis. It was listed as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity 
(EMEA/H/C/002705/MEA/002), a category 3 study in 
the RMP. Furthermore, minor editorial wording 
changes in section 4.2 to provide consistent 
information between the SmPC and that already 
existing in the Labelling and PL were introduced. The 
applicant took also the opportunity to implement 
minor editorial change to the labelling. The RMP 8.1 
has also been submitted. In addition, the RMP is 
converted to the RMP template Revision 2. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the 
latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
ADRs were diarrhoea and discoloured faeces, reported by 
14% (n=194) and 9% (n=128) of patients, respectively. 
The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in the first week 
and decreased with duration of use. Diarrhoea was of mild 
to moderate intensity in most patients and resolved in the 
majority of patients within 2 weeks. Discoloured (black) 
faeces is expected for an oral iron-based compound and 
may visually mask gastrointestinal bleeding. For 4 of the 40 
documented concomitant gastrointestinal bleeding events, 
Velphoro-related stool discolouration was reported as 
causing an insignificant delay in diagnosis of 
gastrointestinal bleeding, without affecting patient health. 
In the remaining cases, no delay in diagnosis of 
gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported. The results 
from this study showed that the effectiveness of Velphoro 
in a real-life setting (including concomitant use of other 
phosphate binders in 45% of patients), was in line with that 
observed in the phase 3 clinical study. 
The RMP summary of safety concerns is revised to remove 
the important identified risks of Diarrhoea, Potential Iron 
Accumulation and Masking of Potential GI Bleeding Due to 
Velphoro-Induced Discoloured (Black) Faeces and to 
remove the missing information of Long term use beyond 1 
year, Use in patient population receiving Velphoro 
concomitantly with other PBs and Use in PD patients. The 
completed paediatric study PA-CL-PED-01 is removed from 
the list of additional pharmacovigilance activities.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Velphoro in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

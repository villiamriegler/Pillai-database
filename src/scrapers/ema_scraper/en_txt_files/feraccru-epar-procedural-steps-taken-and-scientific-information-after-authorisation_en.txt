1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

With the present variation the MAH has submitted two in 
vitro studies, one to investigate the effect of Feraccru on 
the permeability of drugs known to interact with ferrous 
products (Study CYP0747 R3), and a second study 
(XenoGesis Study no. 2015_06_23, 2015) conducted to 
determine the UGT isoenzyme(s) responsible for the 
glucuronidation of the maltol component of ST10. The 
product information has been amended to reflect that 
maltol is glucuronised through UGT1A6 and by sulphation. 
It is not known if medical products that inhibit UGT 
enzymes have the potential to increase maltol 
concentration, but the possibility of an interaction of other 
drugs that inhibit UGT enzymes cannot be ruled out. 
Submission of two final study reports for in vitro 
studies conducted as part of post-authorisation 
measures MEA 001 and MEA 002:  
- 
One drug-drug interaction study to 
investigate drug interactions with Feraccru 
- 
One drug-drug interaction study to identify 
UGT isoenzyme(s) that are responsible for 
metabolism of ferric maltol. 
Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC and the RMP have 
been updated to reflect the completion and results of 
the studies. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics and to the Risk 
Management Plan.

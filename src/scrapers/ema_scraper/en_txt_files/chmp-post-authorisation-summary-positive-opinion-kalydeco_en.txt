On 26 June 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Kalydeco. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals (U.K.) Ltd. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that 
they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the 
opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the indication of Kalydeco, introducing new cystic fibrosis genotypes for 
which the use of Kalydeco is indicated.  
The full indication for Kalydeco will be as follows2:

(class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, 
S1255P, S549N, or S549R. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion.

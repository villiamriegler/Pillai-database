2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised application for a marketing authorisation concerns a generic application according to article 
10(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  for  Vildagliptin/Metformin  hydrochloride  Accord  (vildagliptin/metformin 
hydrochloride), film-coated tablets, 50 mg / 850 mg and 50 mg / 1000 mg. Application has been submitted by 
the applicant Accord Healthcare S.L.U., Spain. 
The reference medicinal product is Eucreas available in the form of 50 mg / 850 mg and 50 mg / 1000 mg film-
coated tablets (MAA No: EU/1/07/425, Novartis Europharm Limited, Ireland) authorised on 14 November 2007 
in the EU.  
Vildagliptin/Metformin  hydrochloride  Accord  has  the  same  quantity  of  the  active  substance,  same 
pharmaceutical form, strengths and route of administration as the chosen reference medicinal product. 
In addition, the proposed indication and posology are in line with the chosen reference medicinal product. 
Two bioequivalence (BE) studies (one for the 50 mg/850 mg strength and one for the 50 mg/1000 mg strength) 
have been performed using the reference medicinal product, Eucreas.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  50  mg/850  mg  or  50  mg/1000  mg  of 
vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride as active substances. 
Other  ingredients  are  hydroxypropylcellulose,  low-substituted  hydroxypropylcellullose,  microcrystalline 
cellulose, magnesium stearate in the tablet core and hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide yellow 
(E172), macrogol 6000 and talc in the film-coating.  
The product is packed in aluminium-aluminium (Alu-Alu) blisters.  
2.2.2.  Active substance vildagliptin 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The  chemical  name  of  vildagliptin  is  2(S)-1-[2-[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl]  pyrrolidine-2-

g/mol and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022 
Page 11/38 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Vildagliptin active substance structure 
The chemical structure of vildagliptin was elucidated by a combination of IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, 
13C-NMR spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. 
The  solid-state  properties  of  the  vildagliptin  active  substance  were  measured  by  differential  scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray powder diffraction. 
The  vildagliptin  active  substance  is  a  white  to  off  white  powder,  freely  soluble  in  water,  in  0.1N  HCl  and  in 
buffers with pH range from 4.1 to 9.0. The vildagliptin active substance is non-hygroscopic. 
Vildagliptin  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  one  chiral  centre.  The  manufacturing  process 
consistently manufactures the S-isomer. Enantiomeric purity is established by an isomeric purity specification 
in  the  advanced  intermediate  (2S)-1-(chloroacetyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidine  and  controlled  routinely  in  the  active 
substance specification by chiral HPLC.  
Polymorphism has been observed for vildagliptin. Form A, of which the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) spectrum is 
matching  with literature  ‘WO2006/078593  A2’,  is  consistently  manufactured by  the  proposed  manufacturer. 
The polymorphic form is controlled via an identification test by XRD in the specification of the active substance 
(comparison of XRD pattern with reference standard). In the finished product, no polymorphic conversion was 
observed under the processing conditions or during storage (evaluation of the finished product after 6 months 
storage at 40 °C/75% RH). 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
One  manufacturer  is  proposed  for  vildagliptin.  Detailed  information  on  the  manufacturing  of  the  active 
substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Vildagliptin is synthesised in two main stages.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  Critical  steps  to  be  monitored  during  the 
manufacturing process of vildagliptin, as well as in-process specifications and corresponding test procedures 
were  presented  in  the  restricted  part  of  the  ASMF.    The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  active 
substance has been described in sufficient details.  
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. In line with 
ICH M7, complementary evaluation with statistically-based (Q)SAR methodology were used for the evaluation 
of the potentially genotoxic impurities. 
Residual solvents are controlled as per ICHQ3C, and relevant specifications have been established in the active 
substance. 
The primary packaging material consists of a blend of HM-HDPE, LDPE and LLDPE and complies with Ph. Eur., 
the Guideline on plastic immediate packaging materials CPMP/QWP/4359/03 and EC 10/2011 as amended. This 
inner  bag  is  placed  in  a  triple laminated  bag  with  desiccant,  which  are  placed  in  a  HDPE  drum,  sealed with 
plastic seal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022 
Page 12/38 
 
 
 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, HPLC, XRD), 
assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  enantiomeric  purity  (chiral  HPLC),  content  of  3-amino-1-hydroxy 
adamantane (GC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur., KF), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated 
ash (Ph. Eur.), particle size (Malvern, laser diffraction), and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The controls of impurities in active substance vildagliptin are adopted based on the ICH guidelines as well as 
on  the  developmental  studies.  Possible  impurities  of  the  final  active  substance  are  categorised  as  organic 
impurities,  inorganic  impurities,  residual  solvents,  metal  reagents  /  catalysts  and  genotoxic  impurities.  The 
information presented regarding potential impurities/degradation products is considered sufficient. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards 
used for assay, related substances, enantiomeric purity and 3-amino-1-hydroxy adamantane testing has been 
presented.  
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three production-scale of vildagliptin from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container 
closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 months under long term conditions 
(25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification (XRD), water content (Ph. Eur., KF), loss on 
drying (Ph. Eur.), assay by HPLC, enantiomeric purity (HPLC), and related substances (HPLC). The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications, without any significant trends. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable  and  does  not  require  any  special  storage  conditions.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest 
period of 3 years in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Active substance metformin hydrochloride 
2.2.3.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride is 1,1-dimethylbiguanide-hydrochloride corresponding to the 
molecular formula C4H12ClN5. The salt form has a relative molecular mass of 165.6 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022 
Page 13/38 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Metformin structure 
The  active  substance  is  white  or  almost  white  crystals,  freely  soluble  in  water.  Metformin  hydrochloride  is 
described  in  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  no.  0931.  As  there  is  a  monograph  of  metformin  in  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the 
European  Pharmacopoeia  (CEP)  for  metformin  hydrochloride  which  has  been  provided  within  the  current 
Marketing Authorisation Application. The active substance exhibits no stereoisomerism since there is no chiral 
centre. 
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
One manufacturer is proposed. The manufacturer produces the active substance in two different manufacturing 
sites located in India covered by the same CEP. 
The primary packaging material consists of a double polyethylene bags placed either in a corrugated box or in 
a fibre drum, as described in the CEP. The double polyethylene bags are made of either LDPE or HM-HDPE. 
2.2.3.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, chlorides, 
HPLC), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), 
sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), bulk density/tapped bulk density (Ph. Eur.), particle size and 
nitrosamine impurities (NDMA, LC-MS). 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022 
Page 14/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The active substance specification applied by the finished product manufacturer is in accordance with the 
current Ph. Eur. monograph on metformin hydrochloride and the CEP, except for the assay specification. The 
test for residual solvents is proposed in addition to the Ph. Eur.  
In addition to the Ph. Eur. monograph tests, the following tests are included in the applicant’s active substance 
specification for metformin: bulk density (Ph. Eur. 2.9.34), particle size (sieve shaker) and NDMA (LC-MS) have 
been  included  in  the  specification.  All  additional  methods  have  been  adequately  validated  and  described 
according to ICH Q2. Metformin hydrochloride is highly soluble, hence the particle size distribution (PSD) is not 
expected to impact the CQAs of the finished product.  
Data  from  metformin  hydrochloride  batches  have  been  provided  demonstrating  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability 
Stability data from both sites of the active substance manufacturers were provided on the active substance 
stored in both the proposed commercial containers. 
The parameters tested are appearance, solubility, appearance of solution, assay, related substances, loss on 
drying. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 3 years, and the proposed expiry period of 5 
years without any special storage conditions in the proposed container. 
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.4.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development

Class  III).  The  physicochemical  properties  of  both  substances  have  been  discussed.  Since  both  active 
substances are highly soluble, their PSD is not expected to impact the CQAs/QTPP of the finished product The 
effect  of  the  PSD  of  active  substance  in  relation  to  product  behaviour  and  manufacturability  have  been 
evaluated and a limit has been set in the specification of metformin hydrochloride. X-Ray Powder Diffraction 
(XRPD) data on one batch of the finished product of each strength stored for up to six months under accelerated 
storage  conditions  has  been  provided  confirming  the  physical  stability  of  the  desired  polymorphic  forms  for 
both active substances. Vildagliptin (R)-isomer is controlled in the active substance specification.  
The  compatibility  of  a  number  of  commonly  used  excipients,  in  proportions  expected  to  be  used  during 
formulation, was evaluated for each active substance and for a combination of both active substances in a pre-
formulation  open-plate  study  under  stressed  conditions  (50°C/  75%  RH,  one  month  storage).  Since  no 
degradation of the active substances was observed, it was concluded that both active substances are compatible 
with the excipients at the studied levels. Critical functionality related characteristics of the excipients have been 
discussed. The choice of excipients used for the finished product have been justified. All excipients are well 
known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, with exception of iron 
oxide yellow (E171), which complies with EU No.231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the summary of product characteristics 
(SmPC).  
The two proposed finished product strengths are not dose proportional and do not come from the same 
blend.  
Process optimisation was carried out for kneading time, lubrication time, compression speed and compression 
force (with resulting tablet hardness).  
The  QC  dissolution  method  was  developed  taking  into  account  the  solubility  of  vildagliptin  and  metformin 
hydrochloride  at  the  different  pH  ranges  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  the  feasibility  to  achieve  sink 
conditions.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the  dissolution  method  was  demonstrated  by  testing  a  batch  with 
deviating composition (different amount of disintegrant quantity) versus a target batch, this for both strengths.  
Bioequivalence studies in fed conditions were performed against the reference products. In both studies, the 
bioequivalence criteria with respect to Cmax, AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ for vildagliptin and metformin were met. 
The batch size of the tested products used in bioequivalence studies is representative as it corresponds to the 
production scale size.  
The similarity of dissolution profiles of biobatches of the tested and reference products (both strengths) were 
demonstrated  across  the  physiological  pH  range.  Profiles  were  compared  using  f1/f2  testing,  and  statistical 
bootstrapping methodology as a supportive technique, as discussed in the clinical section of the report. 
The primary packaging for the finished product is aluminium/aluminium blisters. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.2.4.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: dry mixing/granulation, wet milling, drying, sizing, 
sifting  of  extra-granular  components,  lubrication,  compression,  film  coating  and  packaging.  It  is  adequately 
described. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022 
Page 16/38 
 
 
 
In-process  controls  for  lubricated  granules,  uncoated  tablets,  coating  stage  and  packaging  steps  have  been 
described.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process.  Successful  process 
validation  has  been  carried  out  on  three  consecutive  commercial  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  finished 
product. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
The  primary  packaging  materials  for  the  intermediates  are  HDPE  bags  (for  lubricated  granules,  uncoated 
tablets,  and  for  film-coated  tablets  awaiting  further  processing),  and  triple  laminated  aluminium  bags 
(PET/Al/LDPE) with silica gel bag (for the finished bulk tablets during transportation to the (re)packaging sites). 
These  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and/or  EC  Requirements.    The  proposed  holding  time  for  lubricated 
granules, uncoated tablets and film-coated tablets are acceptable and supported by stability data. 
2.2.4.3.  Product specification(s)  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description (visual), average weight (in-house), identification (HPLC + UV), assay (HPLC), loss on drying (in-
house),  dissolution  (HPLC  for  vildagliptin,  UV  for  metformin  hydrochloride),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph. 
Eur., for vildagliptin by content uniformity, for metformin hydrochloride by mass variation), related substances 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), microbial examination (Ph. Eur.), N-nitrosodimethylamine (HPLC-MS). 
A number of questions on tightening of limits were raised during the procedure. This resulted in the following 
changes:  tightening  of  the  dissolution  limit  (release  and  shelf  life)  according  to  the  results  obtained  for 
biobatches; tightening of the release limits for loss on drying, total impurities of vildagliptin and total impurities 
of  metformin  hydrochloride  based  on  batch  results;  tightening  of  the  shelf  life  limit  for  total  impurities  of 
metformin hydrochloride based on stability results. Based on additional scientific rationale from the applicant 
(in silico report generated with Derek Nexus software), the vildagliptin impurities (related compounds 2 and 3) 
are considered as non-genotoxic, the shelf-life acceptance criteria of not more than 1% for concerned impurities 
were  accepted,  and  omission  of  an  in  vivo  study  to  qualify  concerned  impurities  at  the  proposed  limit  was 
considered justified.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment and ICP-
MS test results presented for 3 batches of both active substances, it can be concluded that it is not necessary 
to  include  any  elemental  impurity  controls.  The  information  on  the  control  of  elemental  impurities  is 
satisfactory.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  3  batches  manufactured  at  the  proposed  commercial  scale  for  each 
strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.

2.2.4.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production-scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride film-coated tablets 
are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  
Samples were tested for the shelf-life specifications.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All  tested  parameters  remained  well  within  the  applied  acceptance  criteria  and  no  significant  changes  were 
observed  after  18  months  storage  under  long  term  conditions  and  6  months  storage  under  accelerated 
conditions.  Only  a  slight  increase  in  water  content  (accelerated  conditions  only)  and  vildagliptin  impurities 
(accelerated and long-term conditions) was observed.  
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Based on the test results, it was concluded that the product is 
photostable in the proposed commercial packaging. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and without specific storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
2.2.4.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, three quality MOs, one related to the dissolution 
test limits, one to the nitrosamine impurities controls, and one related to GMP documentation deficiencies were 
resolved satisfactorily. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.7.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided,  which  is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The  non-clinical  aspects  of  the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product Eucreas, film-coated tablets. The impurity profile has 
been  only  briefly  discussed  in  Non-clinical  Overview.  However,  more  comprehensive  data  are  provided  in 
module 3, which is considered as sufficient.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.   
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant´s  justification  for  omission  of  a  full  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  based  on  generic 
nature of the product was not sufficient and consumption data were required in line with Questions and answers 
on 
'Guideline  on 
the  environmental 
risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1, 2006). Following the provided clarification on some aspects of submitted 
consumption data, it is concluded that market authorization of the generic product in question is not expected 
to pose additional risks to the environment.    
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product Eucreas, film-coated 
tablets. The applicant was requested to provide further in silico evidence as additional supporting evidence to 
qualify impurities (the reader is referred to quality part of the assessment). The issue has been solved. 
No ERA studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Vildagliptin/Metformin 
hydrochloride  Accord  manufactured  by  Accord  Healthcare  S.L.U.  is  considered  unlikely  to  result  in  any 
significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  vildagliptin  /  metformin  hydrochloride  containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the justifications for absence of new non-clinical and ERA data as acceptable. From a non-
clinical point of view, no conditions for marketing authorisation are anticipated. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing vildagliptin / metformin hydrochloride 50 mg / 850 mg 
and  50  mg  /  1000  mg.  To  support  the  marketing  authorisation  application  the  applicant  conducted  two 
bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fed conditions. These studies were the pivotal studies for 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022

the vildagliptin / metformin hydrochloride 50 mg / 850 mg and 50 mg / 1000 mg film-coated tablets. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment, the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of 
particular relevance. 
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies, Project no. 0622-19 (for 
vildagliptin / metformin hydrochloride 50 mg / 850 mg) and Project no. 0623-19 (for vildagliptin / metformin 
hydrochloride 50 mg / 1000 mg). 
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Project no. 0622-19 An open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-
sequence, crossover, single oral dose, bioequivalence study of two formulations of Vildagliptin 50 
mg and Metformin Hydrochloride 850 mg Tablets in healthy, adult, human subjects under fed 
condition. 
Methods 
•  Study design  
This  study  is  designed  as  an    open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence, 
crossover,  bioequivalence  study  of  Vildagliptin  50  mg  and  Metformin  Hydrochloride  850  mg  tablets  (Intas 
Pharmaceuticals  Limited,  India)  and  Eucreas  50  mg/850  mg  film-coated  tablets  (Novartis  Pharma  GmbH, 
Roonstraße 25, D-90429 Nuremberg, Germany) in normal, healthy, adult, human subjects under fed condition. 
After  an  overnight  fast  of  at  least  10  hours,  the  subjects  were  served  a  standardized  high  fat  high  calorie 
vegetarian breakfast, which they consumed within 30 minutes. A single oral dose (Vildagliptin 50 mg/ Metformin 
Hydrochloride 850 mg) of either the test product or the reference product was administered to the subjects at 
Assessment report  
EMA/246681/2022 
Page 20/38 
 
 
 
 
30  minutes  after  serving  the  breakfast.  The  IMP  was  administered  in  sitting  posture  with  240  ±  02  mL  of 
drinking water containing 20% glucose solution at ambient temperature. The IMP administration was as per 
the randomization schedule and under open label conditions. 
As per the protocol, a total of twenty-seven (27) blood samples were to be collected from each subject in each 
period. 
Randomization 
This was a randomised study design. The order of receiving Test Product-T and Reference Product-R for each 
subject in each period of the study was determined according to the randomisation schedule. Equal allocation 
of subjects to each sequence was ensured. 
Blinding 
This was an open label study hence blinding was not done. However, the analysts performing the assay of the 
drug in plasma were unaware of the sequence of administration of the Reference Product-R and Test Product-
T to the individual subjects. 
•  Test and reference products  
Vildagliptin 50 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride 850 mg Tablets manufactured by Intas Pharmaceuticals 
Limited (batch Y14800, exp. Date: 30 September 2021) has been compared to Eucreas 50 mg/850 mg film-
coated tablets manufactured by Novartis Pharma GmbH (Batch No: WFU02 (lot) , exp. Date: 30 June 2020). 
•  Population(s) studied 
Based on the estimates provided by the sponsor, the maximum intra subject variability observed for primary 
pharmacokinetic parameter was found to be ~23%; the sample size computation was determined using SAS 
by considering the following assumptions: 
a.  T/R ratio = 90.0-110.0%, 
b. 
intra-subject C.V. (%) ~ 23%, 
c.  significance level = 5%, 
d.  power ≥ 80%, 
e.  bioequivalence limits = 80.00-125.00%. 
Based on the above estimates, a sample size of 48 subjects were required to establish bioequivalence between 
formulations  with  adequate  power.  Considering  approximately  15%  dropouts  and/or  withdrawals,  a  sample 
size of 56 subjects were sufficient to establish bioequivalence between formulations with adequate power for 
this pivotal study. 
A total of 58 subjects (X-1 and X-2) were checked in for Period-I of the study. Subject Nos. X-1 and X-2 were 
checked in for the study, in order to compensate for any dropouts prior to dosing in Period-I. 
Both the extra subjects were checked out of the facility as none of the subjects discontinued / were withdrawn 
from the study prior to dosing in Period-I. 
No female volunteers were checked in for the study. Hence, as per the protocol, a total of 56 subjects were 
dosed in Period-I of the study.

A total of 54 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. 
•  Analytical methods 
The plasma concentrations of vildagliptin and metformin in the study samples were determined by two separate 
validated LC-MS/MS methods at Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd., India. Vildagliptin was analysed between

19 June 2020 and 28 June 2020 and metformin between 18 June 2020 and 29 June 2020. Vildagliptin and its 
internal standard, vildagliptin-d7, were extracted from heparinized plasma using liquid-liquid extraction method 
into ethyl acetate. Metformin and its internal standard, metformin-d6, were extracted from heparinized human 
plasma using solid-phase extraction method. 
In  the  study,  fifty-six  (56)  subjects  were  dosed.  A  total  of  fifty-four  (54)  subjects  completed  the  trial 
successfully, were analysed and included in the final statistical analysis. In each period, a total of twenty-four 
(24) vildagliptin and twenty-six (26) metformin blood samples were collected from each subject. 
Theoretical number of samples of vildagliptin expected as per protocol was 2688 (56 subjects x 2 periods x 24 
blood collections per period). There were 55 samples not received (samples from withdrawn subjects). Total 
number of samples collected and analysed was 2633. 
Theoretical number of samples of metformin expected as per protocol was 2912 (56 subjects x 2 periods x 26 
blood collections per period). There were 62 samples not received (samples from withdrawn subjects). Total 
number of samples collected and analysed was 2850.  
Certificates of analysis of vildagliptin, vildagliptin-d7 and metformin-d6 hydrochloride as well as USP certificates 
of metformin hydrochloride were attached to the Bioanalytical Report. 
Separately  weighed  stocks  were  used  for  the  preparation  of  calibration  curve  standards  and  quality  control 
samples. Calibration curve standards and quality control samples were stored in the freezer maintained at -65 
± 10°C.

re-assayed as per SOP for vildagliptin (0.4%) and metformin (0.03%), respectively.  
In order to assess the reproducibility of bioanalytical results, incurred samples were selected to cover the entire 
concentration  range.  A  total  of  185  vildagliptin  and  196  metformin  study  samples  were  re-analysed  for  the 
incurred sample reproducibility test. A total of 98.4 % and 100 % of the re-analysed samples met the criteria 
of assay reproducibility for vildagliptin and metformin respectively. 
There was no SOP or Study Protocol/Plan deviation.

•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
These pharmacokinetic parameters were derived individually for each analysed subject from the 
concentration vs. time profiles of Vildagliptin and Metformin in plasma using noncompartmental model of 
Phoenix® WinNonlin® Version 8.1 (Certara L.P.). 
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters were Cmax and AUC0-t.  
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC0-∞, Tmax, λz, t1/2 and AUC_%Extrap_obs. 
Actual time-points of the sample collection were used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. All 
concentration values below the lower limit of quantification were set to zero for the pharmacokinetic and 
statistical calculations. 
•  Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses for Vildagliptin and Metformin were to be performed using PROC GLM of SAS® Version 
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were subjected to analyses of 
variance (ANOVA) for Vildagliptin and Metformin. ANOVA model included Sequence, Subject (Sequence), 
Formulation and Period as fixed effects. Each analysis of variance included calculation of least squares 
means, the difference between adjusted formulation means and the standard error associated with the 
differences. An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the 
model at a significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05). 
Using two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least 
squares means between drug formulations were calculated for ln-transformed data of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ 
for Vildagliptin and Metformin. 
Bioequivalence of Test Product-T vs. Reference Product-R was concluded, if the 90% confidence interval fell 
within the acceptance range (80.00%, 125.00%) for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters for 
Vildagliptin and Metformin. 
Results 
The study was planned so as to obtain the data from 56 evaluable subjects. Out of the dosed 56 subjects, 54 
subjects completed clinical phase of the study successfully. 
Plasma samples of all 56 subjects were analysed. In which, the two withdrawn subjects were also analysed as 
per protocol requirement. 
A total 54 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.

Sequence effect was found to be statistically insignificant for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax 
but it was found to be statistically significant for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t and AUC0-
∞ for Metformin. 
Conclusion regarding statistically significant effects: 
The  cause  for  significant  sequence  effect  may  not  be  found  with  certainty.  Therefore,  under  special 
circumstances the significant sequence effect can be ignored. The study [1] was a single dose study [2] was in 
healthy volunteers, [3] was not comparing an endogenous substance, [4] had an adequate washout and [5] 
used appropriate design and analysis. Hence, this sequence effect is just statistically significant for AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞ and can be ignored. 
Subject  (Sequence)  effect  was  found  to  be  statistically  significant  for  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ both for Vildagliptin and Metformin. 
Since each subject is assigned only one sequence, subjects are said to be nested within sequence. This Subject 
(Sequence) effect is tested by the Residual and should be highly significant. This significance is an indication 
that  the  purpose  of  using  the  crossover  design  has  been  realized  in  that  the  between-subject  variance  is 
significantly larger than the residual. 
Conclusion regarding bioequivalence: 
The  test  to  reference  ratio  of  geometric  least  square  means  with  corresponding  90%  CI  for  ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t were within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%. Therefore, 
the Test Product-T is considered to be bioequivalent to the Reference Product-R under fed condition. 
•  Safety data 
Two (02) adverse events (AEs) were reported by two (02) subjects during the conduct of the study. Both the 
AEs were reported in Period-I of the study. One (01) AE was reported in subject after administration of Test 
Product-T and one (01) AE was reported in subject after administration of Reference Product-R. 
Both the AEs were mild in nature and the subjects were followed up until resolution of their AEs. 
The causality assessment was judged as unlikely for one (01) AE and as possible for the other AE. 
There were no deaths or serious AEs reported during the conduct of the study. 
However, out of the total reported two (02) AEs, one (01) AE was significant. The subject was withdrawn from 
the study on medical grounds. He was treated appropriately and followed up until resolution of AE. The causality 
assessment was judged as unlikely for the AE.

This  study  is  designed  as  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-sequence,  two-treatment,  two-period, 
single oral dose, crossover, bioequivalence study of Vildagliptin 50 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride 1000 mg 
tablets  (Intas  Pharmaceuticals  Limited,  India)  and  Eucreas  50  mg/1000  mg  film-coated  tablets  (Novartis 
Pharma  GmbH,  Roonstraße  25,  D-90429  Nuremberg,  Germany)  in  normal,  healthy,  adult,  human  subjects 
under fed condition. 
After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the subjects were served high fat high calorie vegetarian breakfast, 
which they consumed within 30 minutes. 
A  single  oral  dose  (Vildagliptin  50  mg/  Metformin  Hydrochloride  1000  mg)  of  either  the  test  product  or  the 
reference product was administered to the subjects at 30 minutes after serving the breakfast. The IMP was 
administered in sitting posture with 240 ± 02 mL of drinking water containing 20% glucose solution at ambient 
temperature. The IMP administration was as per the randomization schedule and under open label conditions. 
As per the protocol, a total of twenty-seven (27) blood samples were to be collected from each subject in each 
period. 
Randomization 
This was a randomised study design. The order of receiving Test Product-T and Reference Product-R for each 
subject in each period of the study was determined according to the randomisation schedule. Equal allocation 
of subjects to each sequence was ensured. 
Blinding 
This was an open label study hence blinding was not done. However, the analysts performing the assay of the 
drug in plasma were unaware of the sequence of administration of the Reference Product-R and Test Product-
T to the individual subjects. 
•  Test and reference products  
Vildagliptin 50 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride 1000 mg Tablets, manufactured by Intas Pharmaceuticals 
Limited (batch Y14805, exp. Date: 30 September 2021) has been compared to Eucreas 50 mg/850 mg film-
coated tablets manufactured by Novartis Pharma GmbH (Batch No: WFU02 (lot), exp. Date: 30 June 2020). 
•  Population(s) studied 
Based on the estimates provided by the sponsor, the maximum intra subject variability observed for primary 
pharmacokinetic parameter was found to be ~23%; the sample size computation was determined using SAS 
by considering the following assumptions:  
a.  T/R ratio = 90.0-110.0%, 
b. 
intra-subject C.V (%) ~ 23%, 
c.  significance level = 5%, 
d.  power ≥ 80%, 
e.  bioequivalence limits = 80.00-125.00%. 
Based on the above estimates, a sample size of 48 subjects were required to establish bioequivalence between 
formulations  with  adequate  power.  Considering  approximately  15%  dropouts  and/or  withdrawals,  a  sample 
size of 56 subjects were sufficient to establish bioequivalence between formulations with adequate power for 
this pivotal study.

A total of 58 subjects (X-1 and X-2) were checked in for Period-I of the study. Subject Nos. X-1 and X-2 were 
checked in for the study, in order to compensate for any dropouts prior to dosing in Period-I. 
Both the extra subjects were checked out of the facility as none of the subjects discontinued / were withdrawn 
from the study prior to dosing in Period-I. 
No female volunteers were checked in for the study. Hence, as per the protocol, a total of 56 subjects were 
dosed in Period-I of the study. 
The mean ± SD of age, height, weight and BMI of 56 subjects, who were dosed in the study and 54 subjects 
who were included in the BE evaluation is as follows:

17 July 2020 and 28 July 2020 and metformin between 23 July 2020 and 01 August 2020. Vildagliptin and its 
internal standard, vildagliptin-d7, were extracted from heparinized plasma using liquid-liquid extraction method 
into  ethyl  acetate  (Method  SOP  No.  MS-1408-00).  Metformin  and  its  internal  standard,  metformin-d6,  were 
extracted from heparinized human plasma using solid-phase extraction method (Method SOP No. MS-1402-
00). 
In  the  study,  fifty-six  (56)  subjects  were  dosed.  A  total  of  fifty-four  (54)  subjects  completed  the  trial 
successfully, were analysed and included in the final statistical analysis. In each period, a total of twenty-four 
(24) vildagliptin and twenty-six (26) metformin blood samples were collected from each subject.  
Theoretical number of samples of vildagliptin expected as per protocol was 2688 (56 subjects x 2 periods x 24 
blood collections per period). There were 48 samples not received (samples from withdrawn and discontinued 
subjects). Total number of samples collected and analysed was 2640. 
Theoretical number of samples of metformin expected as per protocol was 2912 (56 subjects x 2 periods x 26 
blood collections per period). There were 52 samples not received (samples from withdrawn and discontinued 
subjects). Total number of samples collected and analysed was 2860. 
Certificates of analysis of vildagliptin, vildagliptin-d7 and metformin-d6 hydrochloride as well as USP certificates 
of metformin hydrochloride were attached to the Bioanalytical Report. 
Separately  weighed  stocks  were  used  for  the  preparation  of  calibration  curve  standards  and  quality  control 
samples. Calibration curve standards and quality control samples were stored in the freezer maintained at -65 
± 10°C.

acceptance criteria and was re-assayed. A total of two (2) and four (4) individual samples were re-assayed as 
per SOP for vildagliptin (0.1%) and metformin (5.6% including repeated run), respectively.  
In order to assess the reproducibility of bioanalytical results, incurred samples were selected to cover the entire 
concentration  range.  A  total  of  185  vildagliptin  and  196  metformin  study  samples  were  re-analysed  for  the 
incurred sample reproducibility test. A total of 97.8% and 100 % of the re-analysed samples met the criteria 
of assay reproducibility for vildagliptin and metformin, respectively.

Formulation  effect  was  found  to  be  statistically  insignificant  for  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Metformin. 
Sequence, Period and Subject (Sequence) effects were found to be statistically significant for ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Metformin. 
Reasoning for statistically significant effects both for vildagliptin and metformin: 
The  cause  for  significant  sequence  effect  may  not  be  found  with  certainty.  Therefore,  under  special 
circumstances the significant sequence effect can be ignored. The study [1] was a single dose study [2] was in 
healthy volunteers, [3] was not comparing an endogenous substance, [4] had an adequate washout and [5] 
used appropriate design and analysis. Hence, this sequence effect is just statistically significant for Cmax, AUC0-
t and AUC0-∞ and can be ignored. 
In the study, clinical conditions were kept identical in both the period of the study, and there were no pre-dose 
concentrations  observed.  The  decision  of  bioequivalence  is  based  on  the  90%  confidence  interval  by 
Schuirmann two one sided ‘t-test’ which is within the acceptance criteria 80.00-125.00%. This significant period 
effect  for  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax,  AUC0-t and  AUC0-∞  is  just  statistically  significant 
and can be ignored.  
Since each subject is assigned only one sequence, subjects are said to be nested within sequence. This Subject 
(Sequence) effect is tested by the Residual and should be highly significant. This significance is an indication 
that  the  purpose  of  using  the  crossover  design  has  been  realized  in  that  the  between-subject  variance  is 
significantly larger than the residual. 
Conclusion: 
The results of this study demonstrate that, the criteria used to assess bioequivalence between the test and 
reference formulations were fulfilled for Vildagliptin and Metformin.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To  support  the  application,  the  company  has  submitted  two  bioequivalence  studies.  The  applicant  has 
conducted  an  open  labelled  randomised,  two-period,  two-sequence,  cross-over,  single  dose,  comparative 
bioequivalence  study  of  Vildagliptin/Metformin  50  mg/850  mg  tablets  Accord  and  Vildagliptin/Metformin  50 
mg/1000 mg tablets Accord and Eucreas 50 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets and Eucreas 50 mg/1000 mg film-
coated tablets of Novartis Europharm Limited, Germany in healthy adult subjects under fed conditions.  
Overall, the CHMP concluded that bioequivalence has been demonstrated. 90% CIs fell into the predefined limit 
80-125%, for both AUC0-t and Cmax. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord 50 mg / 850 mg 
and 50 mg / 1000 mg, film-coated tablets, is considered bioequivalent with Eucreas 50 mg / 850 mg and 50 
mg / 1000 mg, film-coated tablets.

2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Eucreas film-coated tablets and Solifenacin succinate 5/10mg film-
coated tablets. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of Vildagliptin/metformin film-coated tablets (50 mg/850 mg and 
50 mg/1000 mg). The reference products Eucreas 50 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets and Eucreas 50 
mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
To support this application, the Applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies. The study design was 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective 
European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period 
were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were 
adequate. 
In Project no. 0622-19, the test formulation of Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride 50 mg/850 mg film-
coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Eucreas 50

mg/850 mg film-coated tablets. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 
80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
In Project no. 0623-19, the test formulation of Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride 50 mg/1000 mg film-
coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Eucreas 50 
mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 
80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
- 
- 
- 
in patients who are inadequately controlled with metformin hydrochloride alone. 
in patients who are already being treated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin   
hydrochloride, as separate tablets. 
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, when 
these do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on 
different combinations). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

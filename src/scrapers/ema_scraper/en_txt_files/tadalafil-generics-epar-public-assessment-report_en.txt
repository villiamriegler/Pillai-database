the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing 
authorisation to Tadalafil Generics. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The proposed product is an immediate release film-coated 20 mg tablets containing tadalafil as active 
substance. Tadalafil is a chemical substance and the dosage form has been developed as generic product 
to the centrally authorised product Adcirca 20 mg Filmtabletten by the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., 
Netherlands containing the same active substance in the same pharmaceutical form. 
Tadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible 
for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Pulmonary arterial hypertension is 
associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and consequent reduction of 
cGMP concentrations within the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. PDE5 is the predominant 
phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the 
concentrations of cGMP resulting in relaxation of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell and 
vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed. 
Tadalafil is approved in the EU for the treatment: 
Adults 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and 
III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and in 
pulmonary hypertension related to collagen vascular disease. 
About the disease 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder with reports estimating its prevalence at 
between 15 and 52 cases per one million patients (Falk JA et al., 2010). PAH is a chronic disease of the 
pulmonary vasculature defined as the presence of a mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg at rest 
(or >30 mmHg during exercise) in the presence of mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure <15 mmHg 
(Katz SD et al., 2008). 
The pathogenesis of this disorder is complex and incompletely characterized. Increased pulmonary artery 
blood pressures are associated with structural changes in the pulmonary circulation characterized by 
pulmonary arteriopathy (intimal thickening, medial hypertrophy, adventitial thickening, and plexiform 
lesions), in-situ thrombosis, and rarefaction of the microcirculation (Katz SD et al., 2008). 
Clinical manifestations of PAH are related to the hemodynamic effects of increased afterload on the right 
ventricle and systemic manifestations of the comorbid conditions associated with elevated pulmonary 
vascular resistance. Progressive exercise intolerance, lower extremity edema, ascites, and syncope are 
common clinical presentations. Although duplex echocardiography is considered an excellent screening 
tool in suspected cases, cardiac catheterization with direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures 
is required for definitive diagnosis. PAH is associated with progressive right ventricular failure and high 
mortality risk (Katz SD et al., 2008). 
Traditional classification of pulmonary hypertension largely differentiated patients with idiopathic or 
primary cases from patients with PH from secondary causes. This classification scheme had many 
limitations as it did not adequately describe underlying mechanisms of the disease and their implications 
EMA/803097/2016  
Page 11/26 
 
 
  
 
 
 
for potential treatment options, based on the pathophysiology of the underlying conditions (Falk JA et al., 
2010). 
Proposed indication, posology and use in special populations 
Tadalafil is indicated in adults for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified as 
WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH 
(IPAH) and in PAH related to collagen vascular disease. 
Treatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of PAH. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 40 mg (2 x 20 mg) taken once daily with or without food. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients  
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment  
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment a starting dose of 20 mg once per day is 
recommended. The dose may be increased to 40 mg once per day, based on individual efficacy and 
tolerability. In patients with severe renal impairment the use of tadalafil is not recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment  
Due to limited clinical experience in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A 
and B), following single doses of 10 mg, a starting dose of 20 mg once per day may be considered. If 
tadalafil is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing 
physician. Patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied and therefore 
dosing of tadalafil is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of tadalafil in individuals below 18 years of age has not yet been established. No 
data are available.  
Method of administration  
Tadalafil Generics is for oral use. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The proposed product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 20 mg of tadalafil 
as active substance. The product has been developed as generic product to the centrally authorised 
product Adcirca 20 mg film-coated tablets containing the same active substance in the same 
pharmaceutical form. 
Other ingredients are:  
EMA/803097/2016  
Page 12/26 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Tablet core: lactose anhydrous, poloxamer 188, cellulose microcrystalline (pH101), povidone (K-25), 
croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, sodium lauril sulfate, and silica colloidal anhydrous. 
Film-coat: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), and triacetin. 
The product is available in PVC/PE/PVdC-Alu blisters in carton. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tadalafil is (6R-trans)-6-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)- 
2,3,6,7,12,12a-hexahydro-2-methyl-pyrazino [1', 2':1,6] pyrido[3,4-b]indole-1,4-dione. 
The active substance is a white or almost white powder which is practically insoluble in water, freely 
soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and slightly soluble in methylene chloride.  
As there is a monograph of tadalafil in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for tadalafil 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph.  
Additional specifications have been set for impurities, residual solvents and particle size. The analytical 
method for particle size has been adequately validated and it was demonstrated that it is not a critical 
factor for either the finished product performance or the manufacturing process.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product Tadalafil Generics film-coated tablets was developed as a generic bioequivalent to 
Adcirca by Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. from the European market. The formulation contains the active 
substance tadalafil, officially listed in the Ph. Eur. Tadalafil is a white or almost white powder, practically 
insoluble in water, freely soluble in DMSO and slightly soluble in methylene chloride. The excipients 
selected for the formulation development are based on literature survey, excipient compatibility studies 
and their functionality for development of a tablet dosage form. The choice and function of the excipients 
has been adequately described. The excipients in tested product are similar to those found in the 
originator Adcirca, with the addition of Povidone (binder), Poloxamer (solubilizer), and silica colloidal 
anhydrous (glidant). All of the excipients are conventional pharmaceutical ingredients that comply with 
EMA/803097/2016  
Page 13/26 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the respective requirements of the Ph. Eur., with the exception of the film coating agent Opadry II white. 
However, the individual components of the coating material comply with Ph.Eur. or EU regulation 
231/2012 for the colorants. 
The manufacturing process development strategy was to design and develop stable and bioequivalent 
generic product of Tadalafil film coated tablets using commonly used excipients and similar to reference 
product. The active substance characterization has revealed that the active substance had very poor flow 
properties. Therefore a wet granulation process was chosen. During development the manufacturing 
process was optimized with regard to the following parameters: solvent system for granulation, drying 
temperature, milling process, blending time, tableting speed and hardness. 
The applicant evaluated the dissolution of the reference product in different dissolution media covering 
different pHs. Different surfactants were also evaluated. Based on the obtained results, the final 
conditions were selected.  
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been studied by varying the quantitative 
composition of the formulation (level of disintegrant) and changing the manufacturing process 
(lubrication time). The results from this study demonstrated the discriminatory nature of the method 
proposed. 
The dissolution characteristics of the finished product were compared to the reference medicinal product 
Adcirca from the European market. Comparative dissolution profiles were generated in relevant 
dissolution media.  
In one medium the dissolution profiles were similar. For the other media faster release of drug in the test 
product was observed when compared to the reference product. This may be due to the difference in the 
composition between both products. Nevertheless, since Tadalafil is rapidly absorbed after oral 
administration, the difference in the in-vitro drug release at the initial time points will not have any 
significant impact on in vivo drug release. This was confirmed by the bioequivalence studies (see clinical 
section).  
The formulation used in the clinical study and the formulation intended for commercial supplies is 
identical except for the Opadry film coating material which is non-functional in nature. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVdC-Alu blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product 
The product is manufactured using a wet granulation process. The manufacturing process consists of 10 
main steps: dispensing, sifting, granulation and drying, milling, mixing of granules, blending, 
compression, coating, inspection and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
A process validation scheme has been provided and the applicant has committed to perform process 
validation studies on the first three production scale batches of Tadalafil 20 mg film coated tablets before 
the product is placed on the market.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (UV, IR), color identification, dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (by 
content uniformity), assay (UV), related substances (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents 
(GC), and microbiological test (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results are provided for three batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Analytical methods were adequately described. Validations of analytical methods were provided for HPLC 
methods for assay, related substances and dissolution. Stability indicating capability of the HPLC method 
for assay, related substances and dissolution has been demonstrated through forced degradation studies. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data for five pilot scale  batches of finished product stored under long term conditions at 25ºC / 
60% RH for up to 36 months and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Additional results on the product packed in a simulated bulk shipment pack were provided. This simulated 
pack only differs in size with the bulk shipment pack which will be use in the commercial setting.  
Samples were tested for description, dissolution, assay (HPLC), related substances, loss on drying and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No change to the appearance of the tablets was observed under any of the conditions tested. Dissolution, 
assay, related substances, loss on drying and microbiological (if tested) results were within the shelf life 
specification limits at all time points in all the proposed packs. In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light 
as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No 
significant difference in any of the parameters tested (namely, description, assay, related substances, 
loss on drying and dissolution) was observed. Therefore, it was concluded that Tadalafil Generics 20 mg 
film-coated tablets are photostable. 
Based on the accelerated (24 weeks at 40ºC / 75% RH) and long-term (12 months at 25ºC / 60% RH) 
stability results on the product packaged in to simulated bulk shipment pack, a 12 month shelf life with no 
special storage conditions can be accepted for this packaging. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and the finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
EMA/803097/2016

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction 
of Tadalafil Generics manufactured by Mylan S.A.S. is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all tadalafil containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology was 
considered adequate by the CHMP. 
A valid justification for not submitting an ERA was provided. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Tadalafil Generics was provided and was 
accepted by the CHMP. This was in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical 
studies were not considered necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for tablets containing tadalafil. To support the marketing authorisation application 
the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting and fed 
EMA/803097/2016  
Page 16/26 
 
 
  
 
 
 
conditions. These studies were the pivotal studies for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) and Question number 10 of the Questions & Answers: Positions on 
specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working Party (EMEA/618604/2008 rev.13) are of 
particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies. 
According to the EMA Tadalafil product-specific guidance (CHMP/PKWP/EMA/423735/2013), the 
reference product is considered to have specific formulation characteristics to enhance the rate of 
absorption of the drug and therefore, it cannot be assumed that the impact of food will be the same 
regardless of formulation. The product can be taken without regard to food. Thus, both fasted and fed 
state comparisons of test to reference formulations are required to establish bioequivalence.

Study No. 080-15 
Methods 
Study design  
This study was an open-label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-sequence, two period, 
cross-over, single dose, oral bioequivalence study of two different tadalafil formulations in adult, male, 
human subjects under fasting conditions. A washout period of 14 days was maintained between the each 
treatment schedule. 
Test and reference products  
Tadalafil Generics 20 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by Mylan Laboratories Ltd, India (batch No 
2001691, manufacturing date 12/2012; exp. Date 11/2014) has been compared to Adcirca 20mg 
film-coated tablets manufactured by Eli Lilly Nederland BV, Netherlands (Batch No: C458281, exp. Date 
11/2017). 
Population studied 
Thirty (30) male, healthy subjects of Asian race, with a mean body mass index 22.83 kg/m2 (range 18.81 
– 26.34), and mean age 28 years (range: 21-39) were included in the study.

Four (4) patients in total withdrew from the study.  One patient was absent during the check-in of the 
second period of the study. The other 3 patients withdrew due to an adverse event. 
Analytical methods 
Tadalafil concentrations were determined by HPLC method by tandem mass spectrometry and using 
tadalafil-d3 as an internal standard.   
Calibration curves ranged from 2.011 to 603.915 ng/mL. Quantitation was based on peak area ratio of 
tadalafil versus internal standard. A least squares linear regression with weighing factor 1/x2 was used.  
Samples were analysed in nineteen (19) accepted analytical runs including repeats and ISR each of them 
containing blank and zero samples in singlet, ten calibration standards and QC samples at five levels 
distributed throughout the batch of samples from both periods of two subjects.  
Blank samples were chromatographically checked and no peaks were found at the retention time of 
analyte and ISTD. This demonstrated that there was no interference due to endogenous matrix 
constituents. Blank samples were run after the highest calibration curve standard. 
Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) was performed by using freshly prepared calibration standards and 
79.63% of ISR samples were found to be within acceptance limits. 
There were no protocol or SOP deviation occurred during the study. 
Tadalafil was detected in several pre-dose samples in the quantities lower than 1/20 of Cmax in accordance 
with the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1.  
Den  
The PK parameters for tadalafil were calculated by using non-compartmental model by WinNonlin 
Professional Software (version 5.0). 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics were computed and reported for all pharmacokinetic parameters of tadalafil. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out for Ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and 
AUC0-72hr for tadalafil. ANOVA model included treatment received, the period at which it is given along 
with the sequence in which each treatment being received and the subject effect (nested within the 
sequence). Sequence effect was tested by using the subject nested within sequence mean square from 
the ANOVA as the error term. An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the 
treatment and periods involved in the model at a significance level of 5% (alpha=0.05) and sequence 
effect involved in the model at a significance level of 10% (alpha=0.10). Summary statistics, ANOVA, 
90% confidence intervals, ratio analysis, intra subject variability and power were calculated for tadalafil. 
Geometric means and ratio of means were calculated for tadalafil. 
90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the test and reference product averages (geometric least 
squares means) were calculated for Cmax and AUC0-72hr of tadalafil. 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence were as follows:

Cmax 
AUC0-72hr 
Range of Ln-transformed 90% CI of Tadalafil 
83.88-97.22 
92.91-103.25 
The 90% confidence intervals for geometric least square means of ln-transformed data of Cmax and 
AUC0-72hr of tadalafil were within the bioequivalence acceptance range (80.00 -125.00%).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.6.  PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to the design and layout of Duloxetine Mylan 30 mg Hard 
gastro-resistant capsules (EMEA/H/C/003981). Furthermore, the content of the Tadalafil Generics 20- mg 
film-coated tablets was prepared to be identical with the leaflet the reference product, ADCIRCA 20 mg 
film-coated tablets  The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of tadalafil tablets. The reference product Adcirca 20 mg 
tablets is indicated in adults for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified as WHO 
functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity. No non-clinical studies have been provided for 
this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance 
was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain 
new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics or the efficacy and safety of the active 
substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published 
literature was considered sufficient. 
The applicant submitted two open-label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-sequence, two 
period, cross-over, single dose, oral bioequivalence studies of two different tadalafil formulations in adult, 
male, human subjects. One study was performed under fed conditions and the other under fasting 
conditions. The design of the studies was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall 
sampling time as well as wash-out periods were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Tadalafil Generics 20 mg film-coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with the Adcirca 20mg film-coated tablets. The point estimates and their 
90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the 
protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Tadalafil Generics is favourable in the following indication: treatment in adults 
of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve 
exercise capacity (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH related to collagen vascular disease.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

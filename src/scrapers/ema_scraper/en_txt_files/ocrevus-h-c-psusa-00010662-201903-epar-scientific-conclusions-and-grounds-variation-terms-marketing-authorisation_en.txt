Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ocrelizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Considering the first report of hepatitis B reactivation published for ocrelizumab and described in the 
previous PSUR, the PRAC recommended a minor revision of the statements in section 4.4 of the SmPC on 
the risk of hepatitis B reactivation.   
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ocrelizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ocrelizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

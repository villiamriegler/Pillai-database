1.  Introduction 
On 13 July 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study A1481304 for Revatio, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure P46. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  Following the assessment, the MAH was 
requested to address 2 points. The responses are discussed on pages 7-8, and are considered 
satisfactorily solved. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The indication for paediatric PAH was approved in the EU in May 2011 and was based on data from a 
pivotal clinical study (A1481131) and its extension study (A1481156), which included 234 paediatric 
patients with pulmonary hypertension and with a median treatment duration of 1696 days (~ 4.5 
years). A third study (A1481134) has also been conducted in children with pulmonary hypertension 
after corrective cardiac surgery.  An additional study (A1481252) was conducted in Japanese subjects 
with PAH who were treated with sildenafil. 
The subject of this report is study A1481304, which was a local (India), open-label access study with 
sildenafil citrate in paediatric subjects with PAH who completed Study A1481156.1   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Patients received 20 mg sildenafil tablets.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study A1481304, which was conducted in paediatric subjects with 
PAH to derive clinical benefit from continued treatment with sildenafil citrate.  This study was 
conducted in patients who completed Study A1481156.   
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study A1481304 
Description 
Study A1481304 was a local, open-label access study with sildenafil citrate in paediatric subjects with 
PAH who completed Study A1481156. The end-of-treatment visit for Study A1481156 was considered

as Visit 1 for Study A1481304.  The study involved an initial visit followed by visits at a frequency 
defined by the Investigator’s routine standard care.  The follow-up contact was performed according to 
the Investigator’s judgment and as necessitated by the drug supplies.  All subjects returned to the 
clinic every 3 months for drug supplies and documentation of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to provide sildenafil citrate therapy to the paediatric subjects who had 
completed Study A1481156 for the treatment of PAH and were judged by the Investigator to derive 
clinical benefit from continued treatment with sildenafil citrate.  The study medication was to be 
supplied as long as the Investigator felt that the subject continued to derive benefit from the 
treatment. 
Study design 
Study population / Sample size / endpoints 
All the subjects enrolled in the study received the recommended dose of 10 mg TID for subjects with 
body weight ≤20 kg, 20 mg TID for those with body weight >20 kg and 20 mg TID for subjects of 18 
years of age and older regardless of body weight.  Sildenafil citrate tablets were to be taken 
approximately 6 to 8 hours apart, with or without food. 
A total of 4 subjects who completed Study A1481156 were enrolled in Study A1481304 and received 
20 mg TID of sildenafil citrate as daily dose for approximately 21 months during the study.  Of the 4 
subjects, 3 were females and 1 was male, and all were of Asian-Indian origin.  Subjects were aged 
between 16.2 and 25.1 years. 
The primary end point was to provide sildenafil citrate to subjects completing Study A1481156 and 
who were judged by the Investigator to derive clinical benefit from continued treatment with sildenafil 
citrate.  The study medication was to be supplied as long as the Investigator felt that subject continued 
to derive benefit from the treatment. 
Results 
All 4 subjects (aged 16.2 to 25.1 years) with PAH received 20 mg TID sildenafil for compassionate use 
for 17.8 to 18.3 months. 
CHMP’s comment 
All  4  patients  have  equal  treatment  duration  of  18  months.  It  is  however  unclear  why  that  period  is 
similar and if patients are continued to be treated under this compassionate use program (LoQ). It is 
also  not  clear  why  a  patient  above  18  years  would  be  included  in  the  current  paediatric  program 
(LoQ).  
Efficacy results 
New efficacy data did not come available with this study.

Safety results 
A total of 3 out of 4 subjects experienced 8 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  The majority 
of the TEAEs (5) were reported for 1 subject (Subject 10021002), see table below.

All but 3 TEAEs were assessed by the Investigator as not related to the study medication, and for 3 
TEAEs no causality relationship was provided.  All TEAEs and the SAE were resolved at study 
completion.  The severity of the TEAEs was not assessed by the Investigator. 
Subject 10021002 experienced a lower respiratory tract infection, which was assessed by the 
Investigator as non-serious.  However, upon review of the AE, the Sponsor assessed the event as 
serious based on interpretation of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) List of 
Critical Terms.  The Investigator considered the SAE to be not related to the study medication. 
None of the subjects died during the study and no significant AEs occurred (see Table 3). 
Company conclusion on benefit / risk 
The safety data obtained from the sildenafil citrate compassionate-use study is consistent with the data 
obtained in other adult and paediatric PAH studies. The MAH is of the opinion that the paediatric results 
do not change the favourable risk/benefit relationship for paediatric patients and do not warrant any 
change to the product label. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No new information on the use of sildenafil in a paediatric population has come to light from this small 
study. The approved clinical doses have been used. The patients received doses in the lower dose 
range, i.e. 20 mg TID, used in the original paediatric study from which these patients were recruited. 
This is appropriate as in that long term paediatric extension study, an increase in deaths was observed 
in patients administered sildenafil at the higher dose range. 
3.  Additional clarification requested 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this 
procedure:

1.  Are  these  patients  continued  to  be  treated  with  sildenafil  in  the  framework  of  this 
compassionate use program?  
2.  The  age  range  of  the  recruited  patients  is  from  16.2  to  25.1  years,  indicating  that  some  of 
them may not fall under the paediatric regulation. The MAH is requested to clarify. 
The  timetable  is  a  30  day  response  timetable  with clock  stop.  The  MAH  should  submit  the  responses 
within 1 month. 
4.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1: 
Are these patients continued to be treated with sildenafil in the framework of this compassionate use 
program? 
Applicant's Response: 
The patients from Study A1481304 are no longer being treated with sildenafil in the framework of a 
compassionate use program managed by Pfizer.  Once the study was terminated in August 2014, the 
patient’s primary physician assumed responsibility for their continued treatment.  Decisions regarding 
a patient’s treatment program rest with their primary physicians.   
CHMP's Response. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2: 
The age range of the recruited patients is from 16.2 to 25.1 years, indicating that some of them may 
not fall under the paediatric regulation. The MAH is requested to clarify. 
Applicant's Response: 
Study A1481304 was a compassionate use study in which physicians could continue to treat their 
patients with sildenafil if they determined that the patients had responded to sildenafil in the Revatio 
program conducted in paediatric patients with PAH.  This program began with Study A1481131, a 
short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sildenafil in patients aged 1 to 17 years that 
included 16 weeks of treatment.  Subsequent to this study, patients could enter Study A1481156, 
which was an open-label, long-term extension study for the continued assessment of the safety of the 
use of sildenafil in paediatric patients with PAH.  Patients in this study were treated for many years (up 
to 7-8 years) as the study was to be continued until sildenafil was approved for use in the treatment of 
paediatric PAH.  When Study A1481156 was terminated in late 2012, patients who participated in this 
study, and resided in countries where sildenafil was not available for use, were given the opportunity 
to continue to receive sildenafil under the direction of their physician who had been an investigator in 
the study.  The provision of sildenafil to these patients could have been in the form of a compassionate 
use study or program depending on the regulations in the individual country.  In India, the provision of 
sildenafil needed to be within a study and A1481304 was initiated.  Pfizer was committed to providing 
the drug to patients with PAH who, in the physician’s opinion, had responded to sildenafil and could not 
receive the drug locally.  As a consequence, some of the patients who had originally entered Study 
A1481131 under the age of 18, and continued to receive treatment with sildenafil in Study A1481156

and A1481304, became adults during the prolonged period of treatment, but remained in the 
A1481304 study until it concluded.  The patients were initially recruited into A1481131 when they were 
under the age of 18, but became older than 18 during the period of time that the studies were 
conducted. 
CHMP's Response. 
Issue resolved. 
5. CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The submitted study results do not change the benefit-risk of sildenafil in children, if used at the 
approved clinical dose.  The applicant satisfactorily addressed the additional questions.

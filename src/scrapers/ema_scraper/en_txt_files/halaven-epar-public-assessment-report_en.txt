2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Breast  cancer  is  the  most  frequent  cancer  in  women  worldwide  with  an  estimated  1.38  million  new 
cases  in  2008,  constituting  23%  of  all  cancers  in  women.  Approximately  1  in  8  women  will  develop 
breast cancer in their lifetime. While a small proportion of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis, 
around  one  third  will  eventually  have  metastatic  disease,  for  which  there  is  still  no  cure.  Palliative 
treatment  with  radiotherapy,  chemotherapy,  hormonal  and  biologic  therapy,  can  however  reduce 
tumour symptoms and/or prolong life. 
Eribulin  mesylate  is  a  structurally  simplified  synthetic  analogue  of  halichondrin  B,  which  is  a  natural 
product  isolated  from  the  marine  sponge  Halichondria  okadai.  Eribulin  inhibits  the  growth  phase  of 
microtubule  dynamics  and  sequesters  tubulin  into  non-productive  aggregates.  This  pattern  is  distinct 
from  that  of  members  of  tubulin-targeting  classes  currently  in  clinical  use,  including  taxanes,  vinca 
alkaloids, and epothilones. Eribulin has shown in vitro activity against drug-resistant cells that harbour 
β-tubulin mutations associated with taxane resistance. 
Three CHMP scientific advices were sought and given during the development process: 
The  first,  dated  December  14,  2005,  concerned  the  Phase-II  Study  211.  The  CHMP  believed  that  a 
non-controlled phase-II study was unlikely to provide sufficient information for registration of eribulin, 
and  recommended  a  comparative  phase-III  confirmatory  trial.  The  CHMP  also  recommended  that  a 
comparator arm be included in Study 211. This was not done. 
The second scientific advice, dated June 28, 2006, mainly concerned the Phase-III Study 305, pivotal 
for the present application. The CHMP did not agree with the applicant’s proposal to use progression-
free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint, and stated that overall survival (OS) is the preferred primary 
endpoint. Furthermore, the PFS analysis must be consistent with the primary analysis.  
The CHMP agreed that a phase-II study and one pivotal phase-III study that included a control arm of 
Treatment  of  Physician’s  Choice  could  fulfil  the  requirements  for  a  MAA  in  this  setting.  The  inclusion 
criteria  differed  with  regard  to  requirement  of  prior  capecitabine  therapy  (yes  in  Study  211,  no  in 
Study 305). The CHMP stated that if the results are similar in the whole population of Study 305, in its 
subset  previously  treated  with  capecitabine,  and  in  Study  211,  this  homogeneity  will  support  the 
results  of  Study  305.  However,  if  a  benefit  is  limited  to  patients  previously  treated  with  capecitabine 
(in Study 211 and the subset of Study 305), one could consider that eribulin is beneficial only in this 
subset or when it is compared with a regimen that does not include capecitabine. In addition, previous 
use  of  capecitabine  should  be  a  stratification  factor  in  Study  305.  In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  could 
consider the results of Study 211 as supportive for the intended application provided that the benefit is 
similar in patients having received capecitabine or not before trials.  
The  third  scientific  advice  dated  January  22,  2009,  concerned  the  applicant’s  proposal  for  the 
regulatory starting materials for the synthesis of eribulin mesylate active substance. The CHMP agreed 
that it was acceptable to use ER-803895-00 and ER-804028-00 as starting materials.  
The indication applied for initially was the following: 
  HALAVEN monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with breast cancer who have 
received  at  least  two  chemotherapeutic  regimens  for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease 
(see section 5.1).

The finally approved indication is as follows: 
  HALAVEN  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  progressed  after  at  least  two  chemotherapeutic  regimens 
for  advanced  disease  (see  section  5.1).  Prior  therapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients were not suitable for these treatments.

materials are well characterised and their impurity profiles under control.  
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  active  substance  has  been  sufficiently  described.  Specifications  are 
provided  for  each  reagent  and  solvent  used  in  the  manufacture  of  eribulin  mesylate,  however  there 
were  additional  information  needed  for  the  specifications  of  the  reagents  and  materials,  the 
manufacture and the specifications and this will be provided in the Follow-up Measures (see the list of 
FUMs). Adequate method descriptions and validation summary have been presented. 
The commercial synthesis of eribulin mesylate will be carried out at the authorised manufacturer. Data 
are  provided  on  three  full  scale  batches.  The  process  operating  ranges  and  the  actual  operating 
conditions are satisfactory and provided for each process step. Batch data produced with the proposed 
synthetic route show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly.

Stability 
Primary stability studies on pilot scale batches 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 9/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability  results  have  been  presented  for  3  pilot  scale  batches  kept  in  the  commercial  packaging. 
Batches have been stored 24 months under long term conditions (-65°C and -20°C), 12 months under 
intermediate  conditions  (5°C)  and,  1  month  under  “short  time  excursion  condition”,  (25°C/60%RH). 
The  stability  protocol  is  in  accordance  with  ICH  recommendations  Q1A  (R2).  The  parameters  tested 
against  the  final  specification  were:  Appearance,  identification,  assay,  impurities,  water  content  and 
residual solvents. 
For batches stored at -65 °C up to 24 months no significant changes are observed for any parameters 
studied but under the other conditions, the active substance was found unstable. 
Confirmatory studies on production scale batches 
Data  up  to  24  months  under  long  term  conditions,  12  months  under  intermediate  conditions  are 
provided  for  3  production  scale  batches.  The  protocol,  analytical  procedures,  specifications  and 
packaging  used  are  identical  to  those  of  the  primary  stability  study.  Data  confirmed  the  results  from 
the primary stability batches, the product is only stable at -65 °C. 
Forced degradation studies 
Testing was performed under a variety of stress conditions such as light exposure, heat and humidity. 
Photo stability testing was performed in accordance with the ICH guidance Q1B  
Solid state stress tests by heat and humidity were conducted at 60 °C and 30 °C/75% RH for 1 month. 
The active substance was unstable when exposed to light, heat and humidity. 
Based on the stability studies performed, a re-test period of 2 years for eribulin mesylate for storage at 
-65 °C kept in its commercial packaging is considered acceptable.  
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The pharmaceutical development has been adequately conducted and can be summarised below. 
The  key  properties  of  eribulin  mesylate  active  substance  such  as  solubility  and  stability  in  aqueous 
solution are discussed appropriately in the dossier. An important parameter for the performance of the 
drug  product  is  the  solubility  of  the  active  substance.  There  should  be  no  solubility  problems  at  the 
desired  concentration  of  0.44  mg/ml.    Compatibility  with  regard  to  excipients  is  demonstrated  and 
confirmed by stability data of the drug product in aqueous ethanol solution. 
The function of excipients is detailed. Ethanol anhydrous and water (WFI) are used as solvent. Ethanol 
anhydrous  is  used  to  facilitate  the  dissolution  and  safe  handling  of  eribulin  mesylate  during  the  drug 
product  manufacturing  since  it  is  readily  dissolved  in  ethanol  at  room  temperature.  Hydrochloric  acid 
and/or sodium hydroxide are used to adjust pH if needed.  
The final commercial formulation is the same as the one used for the clinical studies apart for that the 
amount  per  vial  was  changed  during  development  from  0.44  mg  to  0.88  mg  by  increasing  the  fill

volume  from  1  ml  to  2  ml.  A  provision  to  add  HCl  or  NaOH  for  pH  adjustment  was  added  for  the 
manufacture based on the understanding of the pH dependent stability. 
No overage is used during manufacture but an overfill of the vials is specified. A fill volume overage of 
0.26  ml  per  vial  is  used  to  ensure  that  the  labelled  vial  content  of  eribulin  (0.88  mg/2  ml)  can  be 
withdrawn. 
Physico-chemical  properties  such  as  density  and  pH  have  been  adequately  studied.  To  conclude 
Eribulin  mesylate  was  found  to  be  physically  and  chemically  stable  in  aqueous  solutions  over  a  pH 
range of 5-9.  
Halaven 0.44 mg/ml solution for injection is manufactured by a conventional aseptic process for sterile 
liquid since eribulin mesylate cannot withstand terminal steam sterilization. The manufacturing process 
has  not  changed  much  over  time.  The  manufacturing  parameters  and  their  optimisation  are 
satisfactorily  described.  The  changes  performed  (change  of  scale  and  a  provision  to  adjust  the  pH) 
have no impact on the performance of the drug product. 
Stability  studies  have  shown  that  eribulin  mesylate  in  aqueous  solution  is  not  sensitive  to  light. 
Therefore, no precautions relative to light protection are required during the manufacturing process. 
The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  for  eribulin  mesylate  solution  for  injection  has  been  fully 
justified.  It  consists  of  a  clear  glass  vial,  an  elastomeric  closure,  and  an  aluminium  seal.  Adequate 
compatibility studies (including leachage and extractable studies) and stability studies have confirmed 
that the selected container was appropriate.  
The  finished  product  is  a  sterile  and  non-pyrogenic  drug  product.  In  order  to  demonstrate  that  the 
container  closure  system  prevents  microbiological  contamination,  a  microbial  challenge  study  was 
performed.  No  growth  occurred  indicating  the  container  closure  was  appropriate  for  preventing 
microbiological growth. Container closure integrity has also been demonstrated through annual sterility 
testing of stability samples. No sterility failures have been found in the stability studies. 
The product was evaluated for stability and compatibility in common diluents and equipment used for 
infusion. The diluents evaluated were D5W (5% (w/v) aqueous solution of dextrose) and normal saline 
(0.9% (w/v) aqueous solution of sodium chloride). The conclusion is that D5W is not recommended as 
a diluent. Compatibility was also demonstrated with different equipments i.e.: syringes (polypropylene 
PP) 
and 
intravenous 
bags 
(polypropylene 
and 
polyethylene 
or 
polyolefin  with 
polyvinylchloride/diethylhexyl phthalate ports). 
No compatibility studies have been performed with other medicinal products

Stability of the product 
Primary stability studies 
Data are provided for 3 pilot scale batches kept in the commercial packaging stored for 36 months at 
25°C/60%RH,  12  months  at  30°C/65%RH  and  6  months  at  40°C/75%RH  under  ICH  conditions. 
Parameters investigated are: Appearance, particulate matter, pH, assay, impurities and sterility (initial 
and then annually) 
The  batches  are  manufactured  according  to  the  current  process  at  the  site  intended  for  commercial 
production. The vials have been stored in both the upright and the inverted position.  
The  stability  data  show  that  the  degradation  level  increases  with  temperature  but  the  results  remain 
within  the  specifications  under  all  tested  conditions.  There  is  no  clear  difference  between  samples 
stored upright or inverted.  
Photo stability study 
Data are provided for one batch exposed to light conditions according to ICH Q1B (Option 1). The vials 
have been stored in the upright, inverted and the horizontal orientation respectively. 
From  studies  of light  exposure  as  well  as  thermal cycling  it  may  be  concluded  that  there  is  no  major 
change observed. 
Thermal cycling stability study

Data  are  provided  for  one  batch  exposed  to  three  cycles  of  alternating  exposure  to  frozen  (-25  to  -
10°C)  and  accelerated  (40  °C/75%  RH)  storage  conditions.  The  vials  have  been  stored  in  both  the 
upright  and  the  inverted  orientation.  As  expected  considering  the  fact  that  the  degradation  has  been 
demonstrated to be temperature dependent (see results from primary stability studies) a slightly more 
pronounced  degradation  in  terms  of  increase  in  levels  of  degradation  products  and  slight  decrease  in 
assay is seen. 
In-use shelf-life 
For undiluted drug product stored in syringes, it can be assigned an in-use shelf-life of no more than 4 
hours at 25 °C or no more than 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C.   
For diluted solution, the in-use shelf life should be  not more than 24 hours at 2-8 °C, unless dilution 
has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions and in this case the responsibility is on 
the user. 
Based  on  the  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  for  the  drug  product 
packaged in the commercial packaging as stated in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) can 
be accepted.  
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In  general  satisfactory  documentation  has  been  provided  to  confirm  the  acceptable  quality  of  this 
medicinal product, and no major objections have been raised during evaluation. The active substance a 
new  chemical  entity,  a  synthetic  analogue  of  halochondrin  (natural  product  isolated  from  a  marine 
sponge) has been adequately characterized and the specification is acceptable in view of the route of 
synthesis and the various ICH guidelines.  
Concerning  the  finished  product  the  complete  control  strategy  and  an  established  manufacturing 
process  guarantees  consistent  control  of  the  product  quality  which  should  have  a  satisfactory  and 
uniform performance in the clinic. The drug product is stable with respect to degradation.  
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  a  number  of  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  having  no 
impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  provided  a  letter  of  undertaking  and 
committed to resolve these as Follow-Up Measures after the opinion within an agreed timeframe. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  development  of  eribulin  mesylate  consisted  in  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and 
toxicity  studies  including  the  evaluation  of  the  genotoxicity  and  reproductive  toxicity.  Primary 
pharmacology studies were conducted in mice. Pharmacokinetics studies were conducted in mice, rats 
and  dogs.  Safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  dogs.  Eribulin 
mesylate was generally administered intravenously, similarly to the clinical route of administration. 
According  to  the  applicant,  all  pivotal  toxicology  studies  and  the  majority  of  safety  pharmacology 
studies have been performed in accordance with Good laboratory practices (GLP).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to evaluate the primary pharmacodynamic 
effects of eribulin mesylate. 
The  anti-proliferative  effects  of  eribulin  mesylate  were  studied  in  vitro  and  were  compared  to  the 
microtubule  destabiliser  vinblastine  and  the  microtubule  stabilizer  paclitaxel  in  six  cultured  human 
cancer  cell  lines.  The  inhibitory  effect  of  eribulin  mesylate  on  different  phases  of  cell  cycle  was  also 
evaluated using flow cytometric analyses. In these studies eribulin mesylate inhibited growth of a wide 
range of established human cancer cell lines at IC50 values in the nanomolar range via a tubulin-based 
antimitotic mechanism, leading to G2/M block (Gap 2/mitosis stages of cell cycle). The in vitro potency 
of  antiproliferative  activity  was:  eribulin  mesylate  (average  IC50  value  of  1.11±0.27  nM),  vinblastine 
(average  IC  50  value  of  1.21±0.1  nM),  paclitaxel  (average  IC50  value  of  4.60±0.25  nM).  The  IC  50 
values  were  far  below  the  clinically  expected  Cmax  value  of  0.48 µM  after  3  weekly  doses  of  1.23 
mg/m2 of eribulin. 
A study evaluating the IC50 value for inhibition of the rate of tubulin polymerisation showed values for 
rate  and  extent  of  polymerisation  after  60  minutes  of  15.3  and  3.08  µmol/l  (rate)  and  39  µM  and 
4.67 µM (extent) for eribulin mesylate and vinblastine respectively. 
The  antiproliferative  effects  of  eribulin  mesylate  were  also  studied  on  both  non-permeability 
glycoprotein  (P-gp)-expressing  and  P-gp-overexpressing  human  cancer  cells  where  eribulin  mesylate 
was shown to be a substrate for the P-gp drug efflux pump, and thus showed reduced in vitro potency 
against human cancer cells expressing high levels of P-gp. 
The  activity  of  eribulin  mesylate  against  taxol  resistant  cancer  cell  was  studied  in  vitro  (study  CAIVT 
0107). Eribulin mesylate showed activity against 1A9PTX10 and 1A9PTX22 cancer cells which are both 
taxane (paclitaxel)-resistant based on distinct mutations in β-tubulin. Eribulin mesylate showed activity 
comparable to that of vinblastine with no significant resistance (resistance ratios approximately 1.3 in 
both cell lines). 
Combinations  of  eribulin  mesylate  and  docetaxel  led  to  mostly  additive  inhibition  of  in  vitro 
proliferation  of  the  four  breast  cancer  cell  lines  studied.  Effects  of  combining  eribulin  mesylate  with 
carboplatin in four non-small cell lung cancer cell lines varied from additive to moderately antagonistic 
depending on the cell line under study. 
With  regard  to  in  vivo  studies,  eribulin  mesylate  in  the  0.05-1.69  mg/kg  dose  range  was  shown  to 
have anticancer activity against a variety of human cancer xenograft models grown subcutaneously in 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 14/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
athymic  mice.  Different  dosing  schedules  for  administration  of  eribulin  mesylate  as  monotherapy  in 
human breast cancer xenograft were tested and suggested that intermittent dosing such as Q2Dx3 [3 
weeks] and Q4Dx3 are the most effective and least toxic schedules of administration compared to daily 
dosing regimens.  
Treatment with eribulin mesylate was studied in combination with capecitabine, erlotinib, gemcitabine, 
doxorubicin or pemetrexed in human breast or human lung cancer xenograft models. Combination with 
capecitabine, erlotinib or gemcitabine showed enhancement of activity, whereas this was not the case  
with doxorubicin or pemetrexed (data not shown).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology programme consisted of six in vitro and in vivo studies evaluating the effects 
of eribulin mesylate on the following organ systems: cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous, and 
peripheral nervous systems. 
Cardiovascular system 
Two  in  vitro  electrophysiological  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the  effects  of  eribulin  mesylate  on 
human ether a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium currents in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with 
hERG and action potential parameters in the isolated dog Purkinje fibres. The in vivo effects of eribulin 
mesylate on the cardiovascular system were evaluated in beagle dogs.  
In the HEK 293 cells, decreases in the tail current after 15 minutes of exposure were 16.4, 23.2 and 
76.4% for vehicle, eribulin mesylate (30 µmol/L) , and positive control respectively. Thus, there was a 
minor indication of hERG inhibition with eribulin mesylate at a concentration which is approximately 60 
times  above  the  expected  clinical  Cmax  of  0.48  µM.    Treatment  with  1,  10  or  30  µmol/L  of  eribulin 
mesylate produced no effects on the cardiac action potentials in the isolated dog Purkinje fibre.  
Intravenous  infusion  of  eribulin  mesylate  at  0.04 mg/kg  for  60 minutes  to  conscious  beagle  dogs,  on 
days  1,  8  and  15  in  male  and  3,  10  and  17  in  female  dogs  (Study  SPT03-001)  transiently  decreased 
the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate and 
increased the QT and RR intervals in both male and female dogs. However, when QT was corrected for 
changes in RR interval, there was no change in QTcF or QTcQ. The highest tested dose (0.04 mg/kg) 
resulted  in  an  exposure  that  was  lower  than  the  clinical.    Therefore  the  potential  risk  for  cardiac 
arrhythmias has not been adequately evaluated in non clinical studies. However an additional study in 
dogs  with  high  bolus  dose  to  exceed  the  clinical  exposure  is  not  considered  necessary  given  that  a 
clinical study was conducted and a warning related to QT prolongation was added in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. 
Respiratory system 
Eribulin mesylate was administered intravenously to Fischer 344 rats (6/group) via a tail vein at 0.1 or 
0.25 mg/kg and the effects compared to morphine 20 mg/kg (study SPR03-003). Respirations rate and 
tidal volume were recorded at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min post-dose. 
Intravenous  administration  of  the  highest  dose  of  eribulin  mesylate  (0.25  mg/kg)  to  rats  caused  a 
significant decrease (p < 0.05) in respiration rate at 120 min post dose when compared to the vehicle, 
but the decrease was not significant compared with the baseline value for the 0.25 mg/kg group. Rats 
treated with morphine exhibited all the known pharmacological effects.

Central nervous system 
Eribulin mesylate was injected intravenously once to male Fischer 344 rats (6/group) via a tail vein at 
0.1 or 0.25 mg/kg and the effects of this exposure on Irwin test parameters were compared to that of 
2  mg/kg  chlorpromazine.  No  consistent  gross  behavioural  or  physiological  changes  were  recorded 
during the post-dose observation periods for any animal receiving either vehicle or eribulin mesylate. 
Rats treated with 2 mg/kg chlorpromazine exhibited all the known pharmacological effects. 
Peripheral Nervous System 
Neuropathy is a known adverse effect of inhibitors of tubulin polymerisation and microtubule dynamic 
such  as  paclitaxel.  Study  PPC-2009-01  investigated  the  neurotoxicity  potential  of  eribulin  mesylate, 
doses of 0.44, 0.88, 1.31 and 1.75 mg/kg were administered to BALB/c mice on a Q2Dx3 [x 2 weeks] 
schedule  (Area  under  the  plasma  concentration  time  curve  (AUC)  at  1  mg/kg/day  of  308  ng*hr/ml). 
The neurotoxic effects of eribulin mesylate on peripheral nerves were compared with that of paclitaxel 
24 hours after the last treatment in the same study. Eribulin mesylate induced no significant reduction 
in  nerve  conduction  velocity  or  peak  nerve  amplitude  in  caudal  and  digital  nerves,  which  were 
significantly  decreased  upon  treatment  with  paclitaxel.  Some  mild  morphological  changes  consistent 
with  axonopathy  were  evident  in  sciatic  nerve  and  dorsal  root  ganglia  of  eribulin  mesylate  treated 
mice, but only at the 0.75 x maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (1.31 mg/kg dose) and higher.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions study has been submitted for eribulin mesylate. As part of the 
primary pharmacodynamic evaluation, combination studies with other anticancer agents in vitro and in 
vivo have been conducted (data not shown). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of eribulin mesylate was evaluated by in vivo studies in mice, rats and dogs. For 
assessments  of  absorption,  metabolic  characteristics  and  drug-drug  interaction,  in  vitro  studies  with 
Caco-2  cells,  hepatocytes,  liver  microsomes  or  other  sub-cellular  fractions  of  the  liver  were  also 
conducted. Although none of the studies were GLP compliant they were performed at facilities used for 
operating in accordance with the principles of GLP.  
An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantisation of eribulin mesylate in mouse, 
rat,  dog  and  human  plasma.  The  detection  ranges  varied  from  5-200  ng/ml  (mouse)  to  2-200  ng/ml 
(dog).  Improvement  of  the  method  extended  the  range  to  0.1-1000  ng/ml.  14C-Eribulin  acetate  was 
used in radiotracer studies in rats and dogs. The concentration of radioactivity in the blood, urine and 
faeces was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. 
Absorption 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  eribulin  mesylate  has  been  examined  after  single  or  repeated  IV  or  Per  os 
(PO) administration in vivo in mice (four different strains), rats (2 strains) and dogs. 
Eribulin  mesylate  had  low  bioavailability  after  PO  administration  in  mice  and  rats  (<  7%  and  <  3%, 
respectively). Pharmacokinetic data obtained in permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp) deficient mice and in 
rats co-administered orally with cyclosporine (a P-gp inhibitor) suggested that the drug efflux pump P-
gp was a major factor contributing to the low oral bioavailability of eribulin mesylate. The peak plasma 
concentration  following  PO  administration  was  generally  observed  within  4  hours  post-dosing  in  mice 
and rats. 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 16/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
When  eribulin  mesylate  was  administered  intravenously,  its  pharmacokinetic  behaviour  was  fairly 
consistent  in  the  investigated  species  except  in  the  mouse.  Salient  findings  after  single  or  repeated 
intravenous administrations were large distribution volume, slow to moderate clearance, and fairly long 
terminal  half  life  (4-10  h  in  mice,  4-28  h  in  rats,  and  11-45  h  in  dogs  versus  24-66  h  in  human). 
Despite  slow  clearance,  there  was  no  obvious  accumulation  of  eribulin  mesylate  with  the  infusion 
schemes used for repeated dosing. 
Plasma protein binding differed somewhat but was only moderate in all investigated species (<36%), 
including human (49-65%).  
Distribution 
The  tissue  distribution  of  radioactivity  derived  from  drug  following  a  single  IV  administration  of  14C-
eribulin acetate was evaluated in male non-pigmented and pigmented rats by quantitative whole-body 
autoradiography.  The  distribution  results  showed  that  eribulin  mesylate  is  widely  distributed  to  most 
organs and tissues (lung, urinary bladder, renal cortex, renal medulla, liver, spleen, thyroid, stomach 
and salivary gland), except the central nervous system (CNS). High concentrations were found in bile, 
which  is  likely  to  be  a  major  route  for  excretion.  Comparison  of  data  from  pigmented  and  non-
pigmented  animals  did  not  suggest  any  affinity  to  melanin.  Only  male  animals  were  included  in  the 
study. The potential of eribulin mesylate to pass the placenta and its ability to transfer into breast milk 
have  not  been  investigated.  However,  embryo-foetal  developmental  toxicity  in  rats  suggests  that 
eribulin mesylate and/or its metabolites pass through the placenta and are distributed to the foetus. 
In mice, eribulin mesylate showed penetration into LOX human melanoma tumour xenografts following 
single or multiple IV administrations with tumour exposures approximately 20 to 30 times higher than 
that  in  plasma.  The  plasma  concentration  profile  in  LOX-mice  was  not  different  from  that  of  tumour 
free mice. 
With  regards  to  the  blood  distribution,  the  applicant  has  provided  additional  data  indicating  that 
association of eribulin mesylate to blood cells is negligible and thus that plasma is a suitable matrix for 
monitoring eribulin mesylate exposure levels in dogs, rats and humans. 
Metabolism 
From  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  metabolic  studies,  twelve  putative  metabolites  of  eribulin  mesylate  were 
identified or postulated. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggested that CYP3A4 is the main 
enzyme involved. Two studies in rats and dogs, respectively, were also conducted. 14C-eribulin acetate 
was  administered  intravenously  and  samples  of  plasma,  urine,  faeces,  and  bile  (rat  only)  were 
analysed with LC-MS-radio-flow detection. Unchanged eribulin was the major component found in both 
species.  Overall,  the  metabolism  of  eribulin  mesylate  in  vivo  was  limited  and  unchanged  parent 
substance dominated. There were some species differences with a higher degree of metabolism in the 
rat  than  in  the  dog  but  these  differences  were  not  considered  to  have  a  major  impact  on  the 
interpretation of the animal toxicity studies. 
Elimination 
The excretion patterns after a single IV dose in rat and dog showed that eribulin mesylate is eliminated 
mainly via faeces. Faecal excretion was relatively rapid, occurring largely within the first 72 hours in all 
species. Urinary excretion accounted for 8-16% of the administered dose across all species. 
Interactions 
Drug-drug  interactions  were  evaluated  in  vitro  with  Caco-2  cells,  hepatocytes,  liver  microsomes  or 
other  sub-cellular  fractions  of  the  liver.  Eribulin  mesylate  was  shown  to  be  a  substrate  for  the 
CHMP assessment report

transporter P-gp in vitro. However, considering that the IC50 value was >10 μM, P-gp inhibition from 
eribulin mesylate was not considered clinically relevant following administration of therapeutic dosages 
(>26-fold  safety  margin).  Eribulin  mesylate  was  shown  to  inhibit  CYP3A4-mediated  nifedipine 
dehydration,  warfarin  and  testosterone  hydroxylation.  In  vitro  inhibition  on  eribulin  mesylate 
metabolism of co-administered drugs was also investigated. In contrast to the potent inhibition shown 
by  ketoconazole  in  the  suspensions  of  human  primary  hepatocytes,  eribulin  mesylate  elicited  weak 
inhibitory  effects  on  the  CYP3A4-mediated  metabolic  pathways  of  carbamazepine,  diazepam, 
paclitaxel, midazolam, tamoxifen and terfenadine in a concentration-dependent manner.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicology study has been submitted.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
The  toxicological  programme  consisted  of  six  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  (subchronic  and  chronic) 
conducted as IV infusion studies in rats and dogs. All except one supportive study (study G465520A) 
were conducted according to GLP principles. 
In  these  studies,  eribulin  mesylate  was  dissolved  in  5%  ethanol  in  saline,  and  was  administered 
intravenously.  The  infusion  time  was  approximately  1  minute  in  rat  and  1  hour  in  dogs.  The  planned 
infusion  time  in  man is  2-5  minutes.  The  applied  treatment  schedule  in  the subchronic  studies  was  3 
doses  administrated  with  4  or  7  days  interval  (Q4D×3  or  Q7D×3)  followed  by  3,  14  or  26  days 
recovery  period;  the  chronic  studies  applied  6  treatment  cycles  with  3  times  weekly  treatments 
followed by 14 days recovery period. 
Animals were sacrificed at days 12 and 35 for the Q4Dx3 schedule and days 18 and 29 in the Q7Dx3 
schedule. The following parameters were assessed: dose analysis, mortality and clinical observations, 
body  weight,  clinical  pathology  (haematology  and  clinical  chemistry),  gross  pathology  and 
histopathology (Table 1).

In  the  repeat  dose  range  finding  studies,  a  single  dose  of  0.75  mg/kg/day  or  higher  caused  severe 
toxicity leading to sacrifice 3-4 days after dosing in rats. Two doses of 0.075 mg/kg/day (given day 1 
and 5) were lethal to dogs (diarrhoea, emesis correlated with intestinal histopathological changes). No 
mortality in immediate association with dose administration was observed in any study. 
In all the repeat-dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs, eribulin mesylate produced bone marrow 
toxicity  represented  by  a  decrease  in  the  counts  of  peripheral  blood  cells,  including  red  blood  cell

(RBC), white blood count (WBC), neutrophil (SEG), reticulocyte (RET) and/or RBC-related parameters, 
and  depletion  of  bone  marrow  cells  on  histopathological  evaluation.  Comparison  of  IC50  values  for 
proliferation  of  Colony  forming  cell-granulocyte,  erythrocyte,  macrophage,  megakaryocyte  (CFC-
GEMM) bone marrow progenitor cells for eribulin mesylate, vinblastine and paclitaxel showed that dogs 
were somewhat more sensitive than humans for the inhibitory effect of these drugs on the expansion 
of these bone marrow cells. Lymphoid and testicular toxicity were other eribulin mesylate-related side 
effects  in  both  rats  and  dogs.  These  toxicities  appeared  at  0.10  mg/kg,  single  cycle  Q7Dx3  (study 
7306)  and  0.03  mg/kg,  single  cycle  Q4Dx3  in  rats  and  dogs,  respectively  (studies  G465520B  and 
G465520D).  Histopathological  changes  of  the  skeletal  muscle  (degeneration)  and  sciatic  nerve 
(neurofiber degeneration) were also noted in rats alone at ≥0.20 mg/kg (≥1.20 mg/m2). All the signs 
of toxicity, except for the changes in the testes and rat sciatic nerve, were reversible, sometimes with 
a compensatory rebound response of the hematopoietic system.  
Clinical signs of intestinal toxicity such as emesis and diarrhoea correlated to regenerative hyperplasia 
in the crypts/glands of the small and large intestine and small intestine villous atrophy were shown in 
dogs receiving two doses of 0.075 mg/kg/day eribulin mesylate in a Q4Dx3 scheme.   
In  the  chronic  rat  study  (study  7640),  9  animals  died  (one  control,  4  females  on  0.015  mg/kg,  2 
females at 0.05 mg/kg and 2 females at 0.15 mg/kg) after ≥120 days from the start of the treatment. 
In  these  animals,  undigested  food  was  found  in  the  oral  cavity  or  larynx.  The  presence  of  stomach 
ingest  in  the  upper  respiratory  system  was  associated  with  changes  in  the  lungs  such  as  varying 
degrees of inflammation and alveolar edema and histocytosis.  
Another  organ  that  showed  signs  of  toxicity  upon  treatment  with  eribulin  mesylate  in  repeated  dose 
toxicity studies was the liver. Liver necrosis (doses of ≥0.015mg/kg) was observed in the chronic rat 
study (study no. 7640), with increase in relative and absolute liver weights shown in the highest dose 
group (≥0.15mg/kg). Changes in the liver mostly corresponded to simultaneous increase in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) but liver necrosis at doses of ≤0.15mg/kg did 
not appear to correlate with an increase in these values. The applicant provided further analysis of the 
observed  changes  and  considered  the  lesions  not  to  be  directly  related  to  the  test  article  but  more 
likely to be the result of bacterial infections related to severe bone marrow toxicity.  
Decrease  in  the  level  of  electrolytes  (Na+,  K+  and  CL-  )  together  with  increased  blood  urea  nitrogen 
(BUN) was observed in dogs  treated with a single cycle Q4D×3 of eribulin mesylate (study G465520B). 
In  rats  (study  G465520A)  fluctuations  in  sodium,  glucose  and  creatinine  have  also  been  observed.  
Additionally, rats receiving doses of ≥0.05 mg/kg in 6 months (study 7640) showed increased absolute 
and relative kidney weight which were not correlated to any histopathological or electrolyte changes.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The studies consisted in three bacterial 
mutations assays (Ames test), two in vitro genotoxicity studies in mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma 
mutation assays) and one in vivo micronucleus assay in Rats. 
Eribulin mesylate was not mutagenic in the Ames test, either with or without rat liver S9 metabolising 
system, but was positive in the L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay. No increase in in 
vitro  genotoxicity  was  observed  in  the  presence  of  higher  amounts  of  impurities.  In  the  in  vivo  rat 
micronucleus  assay,  eribulin  mesylate  was  clastogenic,  inducing  substantially  larger  micronuclei  than 
those  induced  by  cyclophosphamide.  The  generally  large  sized  micronuclei  induced  by  eribulin 
mesylate  indicated  that  the  effect  was  due  primarily  to  chromosome  segregation  interference  rather 
than to chromosome breakage, which are expected findings for anti-tubulin agents.

Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity study has been submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Neither fertility study nor pre-post natal development study has been submitted with eribulin mesylate. 
In  the  embryo-foetal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rats  (Study  LFA00033),  eribulin  mesylate  was 
administered as a slow bolus injection to female rats (8 animals/dose) once a day on Gestation Days 
(GD) 8, 10 and 12 at doses of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg.  
Decreased  body  weight  (up  to  -30.3%)  and  food  consumption  (up  to  -27.3%)  were  observed  during 
and post dosing period at 0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg. One female at 0.15 mg/kg delivered prematurely, and 
was  sacrificed  on  GD  21.  Eribulin  mesylate-related  clinical  signs  in  dams  included  pale  extremities, 
scant  faces  and  dehydration  at  0.15  mg/kg.  There  were  also  an  increase  in  the  number  of  early 
resorptions at 0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg. Three litters were completely resorbed at 0.15 mg/kg. Decrease 
of  foetal  body  weight  was  also  noted  at  0.10  and  0.15  mg/kg  doses.  External  and/or  soft  tissue 
anomalies (absence of lower jaw, tongue, stomach and spleen) were noted at 0.15 mg/kg, indicating 
that  eribulin  mesylate  possesses  teratogenic  potential.  The  no  observed  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL) 
was 0.03 mg/kg for maternal general toxicity, reproductive function, and embryo-foetal development.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  collected  as  part  as  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies.  The  exposure  to 
eribulin  mesylate  after  repeated  dosing  appeared  to  increase  with  the  dose  in  both  rats  and  dogs. 
Significant  accumulation  of  eribulin  mesylate  was  not  observed  after  either  Q4D×3  or  Q7D×3  dosing 
schedule. Values of AUC showed some fluctuations among animals sometimes with no apparent dose-
dependent differences (study G465520D in dogs, Table 2).

Local Tolerance  
Although  no  local  tolerance  study  has  been  conducted,  local  effects  to  injection  and  infusion  sites  of 
eribulin  mesylate  solution  were  evaluated  macro-  and  microscopically  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity 
studies in rats (Studies 7306 and 7640) and dogs (Studies G465520B, G465520D, 6288 and 6528). In 
those studies, no eribulin mesylate-related effects at injection and infusion sites were observed. 
No non clinical data following paravenous administration were submitted.  
Other toxicity studies 
In vitro Myelotoxicity studies 
Eribulin  mesylate  was  tested  for  toxicity  to  cultured  bone  marrow  cells  from  mouse,  human  and  dog 
(DSD2001-06, DSD2001-07, and DSD2001-08). A similar comparative study was conducted with three 
different  compounds  including  Eribulin  mesylate  active  substance  and  the  marketed  drugs  Paclitaxel 
and  Vinblastine.  IC50  values  for  inhibition  of  colony  formation  of  Colony  forming  unit-granulocyte, 
macrophage  (CFU-GM)  cells  using  colony  forming  assays  (Hipple´s  soft  agar  assay)  and  inhibition  of 
proliferation  of  CFC-GEMM  cells  using  Hematotoxicity  Assay  via  Luminescence  Output  (HALO)  were 
calculated.  The  sensitivity  of  dog  and  human  bone  marrow  to  the  toxicity  of  eribulin  mesylate  was 
similar to IC50 around 15 nM. 
Impurities studies 
Four degradation products (ER-814363, ER-814365, ER-814366, and ER-809307) have been observed 
at  levels  above  the  ICH  Q3B  (R2)  reporting  threshold  (i.e.  >0.1%)  in  primary  stability  studies  for 
eribulin  mesylate  injection.  The  batches  applied  for  the  toxicological  studies  contained  impurities  in 
concentration above the proposed acceptance criteria (limits) for drug product except the degradation 
product ER-809307 which has been observed at 0.65% in study S09043. 
A  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  on  impurities  of  eribulin  mesylate  was  conducted  in  F344  rats  (Study 
S09043).  Eribulin  mesylate  from  high  impurity  batch  (including  residual  solvents  and  metals)  was 
administered as a slow bolus injection to female and male rats (10 animals/group/sex) once a day on 
1, 8 and 15 at doses of 0, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg. On completion of treatment, animals (5/group/sex) were 
subjected to necropsy 3 days (on Day 18) and 14 days (on Day 29) after the last administration. The 
study showed no additional toxicity which could be related to these impurities (data not shown). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  has  submitted  an  environmental  risk  assessment.  The  calculated  PEC-value  was  below 
the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L  and  a  Phase  II  environmental  fate  and  effect  analysis  was  not  deemed 
necessary. Nevertheless, the Applicant conducted a limited programme to establish an environmental 
toxicity  and  fate  profile.  These  data  did  not  raise  any  additional  concerns,  considering  the  low 
estimated  exposure.  Eribulin  mesylate  is  also  not  considered  a  persistent,  bioaccumulative  and  toxic 
substance as log Kow did not exceed 4.5. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Halaven  (eribulin  mesylate)  is  a  non-taxane,  microtubule  dynamics  inhibitor  belonging  to  the 
halichondrin  class  of  antineoplastic  agents.  It  is  a  structurally  simplified  synthetic  analogue  of 
halichondrin  B,  a  natural  product  isolated  from  the  marine  sponge  Halichondria  okadai.  Eribulin

mesylate  inhibits  the  growth  phase  of  microtubules  without  affecting  the  shortening  phase  and 
sequesters  tubulin  into  non-productive  aggregates.    Eribulin  mesylate  exerts  its  effects  via  a  tubulin-
based  antimitotic  mechanism  leading  to  G2/M  cell-cycle  block,  disruption  of  mitotic  spindles,  and, 
ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage. 
In primary pharmacodynamic studies, eribulin mesylate inhibited growth of a wide range of established 
human cancer cell lines at IC50 values in nanomolar range. It turned out to be a substrate for the P-gp 
drug efflux pump, and thus shows reduced in vitro potency against human cancer cells expressing high 
levels  of  P-gp.  Eribulin  mesylate  showed  activity  against  1A9PTX10  and  1A9PTX22  cancer  cells  that 
have  β-tubulin  mutations  and  therefore  are  taxane  (paclitaxel)-resistant.  Combinations  of  eribulin 
mesylate  and  docetaxel  led  to  mostly  additive  inhibition  of  in  vitro  proliferation  of  the  four  breast 
cancer  cell  lines  studied,  whereas  combination  with  carboplatin  varied  from  additive  to  moderately 
antagonistic  depending  on  the  cell  line.  Finally,  in-vivo  studies  have  shown  that  eribulin  mesylate 
generally  has  anticancer  activity  against  a  variety  of  human  cancer  xenograft  models  grown  sc  in 
athymic mice. However, these models have low fidelity to the actual environment in which the tumour 
cells  proliferate,  they  lack  the  relevant  tumour-stroma  interactions  which  are  necessary  for  tumour 
development, progression and metastatic spread and they are generally of limited value to predict the 
effect in patients with metastatic breast cancer or advanced ovarian cancer. 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies  have  been  submitted  for  Halaven  due  to  the  non-specific 
cytotoxicity  of  eribulin  mesylate  as  a  microtubule  growth  inhibitor  and  the  significant  toxicity  of 
microtubule inhibitors. The lack of secondary pharmacodynamics studies is considered acceptable.  
The  exposure  achieved  in  the  in-vivo  safety  pharmacology  studies  is  generally  much  lower  than  the 
expected  human  exposure.  Toxicity  studies  conducted  in  dogs  suggested  that  dosing  of  eribulin 
mesylate  resulting  in  higher  exposure  may  be  feasible  to  administer  (study  G465520B:  Cmax  of 
~100 ng/ml with a dose of 0.075 mg/kg iv; Study DSD2002-42: AUC of ~100ng*h/ml with a dose of 
0.08 mg/kg iv, via cephalic vein).  
Study  PPC-2009-01  clearly  showed  that  eribulin  mesylate,  as  expected,  affects  peripheral  nerve 
function.  Also  results  from  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  gave  further  support  to  this  conclusion. 
Whether  there  is  difference  compared  to  the  effects  of  paclitaxel  cannot  be  decided  based  on  this 
study. 
Salient features of the pharmacokinetic profile of eribulin mesylate after single or repeated intravenous 
administrations included large distribution volume, slow to moderate clearance and fairly long terminal 
half  life.  Despite  slow  clearance,  there  was  no  obvious  accumulation  of  eribulin  mesylate  with  the 
infusion schemes used for repeated dosing. Exposure after repeated dosing appeared to increase with 
dose  in  both  rats  and  dogs.  Plasma  protein  binding  differed  somewhat  but  was  only  moderate  in  all 
investigated  species.  The  distribution  results  showed  that  eribulin  mesylate  is  widely  distributed  to 
most organs and tissues, except the CNS. High concentrations were found in bile, which is likely to be 
a major route for excretion. Eribulin mesylate is eliminated mainly via the faeces. 
Twelve  putative  metabolites  of  eribulin  mesylate  were  identified  or  postulated  and  in  vitro  studies  in 
human liver microsomes suggest that CYP3A4 is the main enzyme involved. However, the metabolism 
of eribulin mesylate in vivo was limited and unchanged parent substance dominated. There were some 
species differences with a higher degree of metabolism in the rat than in the dog but these differences 
are not believed to have a major impact on the interpretation of the animal toxicity studies.

As  expected,  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  eribulin  mesylate  caused  bone  marrow  toxicity  and 
lymphoid  and  testicular  toxicity  at  the  lowest  doses  tested  in  the  rat  and  dog.  Histopathological 
changes  of  the  skeletal  muscle  (degeneration)  and  sciatic  nerve  (neurofiber  degeneration)  were  also 
noted in rats alone. All the signs of toxicity, except for the changes in the testes and rat sciatic nerve, 
were reversible. In addition toxicity results at the high dose have identified the liver as a target organ 
for  toxicity. Possible  signs  of  toxicity were  also  found  on  renal  markers.  However,  it is likely  that  the 
altered changes are attributable to loss of protein and electrolytes from the gastrointestinal tract and 
pre-renal  BUN  increase  from  dehydration  and  poor  renal  perfusion  as  suggested  by  the  applicant.  
Signs of intestinal toxicity such as emesis and diarrhoea were shown in dogs. The presence of stomach 
ingest  in  the  upper  respiratory  system  was  associated  with  changes  in  the  lungs  such  as  varying 
degrees  of  inflammation  and  alveolar  edema  and  histocytosis.  The  applicant  referred  to  these  effects 
as spontaneous oesophagectasis which is reported specifically in the F344 rat in two publications dated 
to  1979  and  1986.  Although  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  exact  cause  of  these  the  syndrome 
described  above  may  be  one  possible  cause.  These  findings  are  however  considered  being  of 
questionable clinical relevance. 
This  pattern  of  toxicity  matches  the  bio-distribution  pattern  of  eribulin  mesylate  in  the  albino  rats 
shown in the pharmacokinetic studies and also the most common adverse effects reported in the clinic. 
No  single-dose  toxicology  study  has  been  submitted  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  current 
recommendations 
from 
the 
European 
guidelines 
(CHMP/SWP/302413/08 
and 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010).  
No  carcinogenicity  study  has  been  submitted  which  is  acceptable  since  according  to  the  guidance  on 
Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals S9, ICH Tripartite Guideline 29th October 2009, 
carcinogenicity  studies  are  not  warranted  for  products  intended  to  treat  patients  with  advanced 
cancers. 
Fertility studies were not submitted with eribulin mesylate. Adequate justifications have been provided 
based  on  repeated-dose  studies  where  irreversible  testicular  toxicity  has  been  observed  in  both  rats 
(hypocellularity  of  seminiferous  epithelium  with  hypospermia/aspermia  and  dogs.  Thus,  male  fertility 
may  be  compromised  by  treatment  with  eribulin  mesylate  based  on  its  mechanism  of  action. 
Additionally,  due  to  a  trend  toward  dose  dependent  reduction  in  the  numbers  of  implantation  sites 
shown when pregnant rats were exposed to eribulin mesylate, an effect of eribulin mesylate on female 
fertility  cannot  be  excluded.  Eribulin mesylate  is embryotoxic,  phototoxic,  and  teratogenic in  rats.  No 
pre-post  natal  development  study  has  been  performed  which  is  acceptable  for  this  type  of  product. 
Overall, the toxicity profile is as expected for this class of compounds. 
No  non  clinical  data  following  paravenous  administration  were  submitted.  However,  the  applicant  has 
provided and discussed data on extravasation in clinical trials where one case out of 1318 patients was 
experienced. 
The  non-clinical  safety  assessment  program,  although  extensive  and  conducted  in  relevant  species,  
had some inherent limitations regarding the toxicity profiles obtained through the applied design of the 
subchronic  and  chronic  toxicity  studies  in  rat  and  dog.  Especially  the  pathology  routines  in  these 
studies were not conducted according to current standards of relevant guidelines. Therefore it cannot 
be  excluded  that  some  low  grade  or  low  incidence  toxicities,  plus  delayed  toxicities  and  pathology 
changes with short reversibility remain unidentified.  However, in the current situation clinical data has 
provided substantial information regarding human toxicities.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  conclusion,  eribulin  mesylate  inhibits  tumour  cell  growth  in  vitro  in  a  wide  range  of  established 
human  cancer  cell  lines.  Administration  of  eribulin  mesylate  in  intermittent  dosing  schedule  showed 
anticancer effects against a variety of human xenograft models.  
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  eribulin  mesylate  was  characterised  by  an  extensive  volume  of 
distribution and a slow to moderate rate of clearance. 
The  safety  pharmacology  studies  suggest  that  eribulin  mesylate  has  a  low  potential  for  exerting 
adverse  effects  on  the  respiratory  and  central  nervous  systems.  In  vitro  studies  did  not  show  any 
adverse effects of eribulin mesylate on the hERG potassium currents and action potential parameters.  
However,  the  potential  risk  of  eribulin  mesylate  for  cardiac  arrhythmias  has  not  been  adequately 
evaluated  in  non  clinical  studies.  However  further  in  vivo  investigation  is  not  considered  necessary 
given  that  a  clinical  study  was  conducted  and  a  warning  related  to  QT  prolongation  was  added  in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the toxicity profile of eribulin mesylate is consistent with the expected effects of a microtubule 
disruptor. 
With  regards  to  genotoxicity,  eribulin  mesylate  was  positive  in  the  mouse  lymphoma  mutagenesis 
assay and was clastogenic in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. 
The toxicology programme revealed toxicity effects of eribulin mesylate on embryo-foetal development 
(including teratogenicity) and fertility. Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior 
to  treatment  because  of  the  possibility  of  irreversible  infertility  due  to  therapy  with  Halaven. 
Furthermore,  women  are  advised  to  avoid  pregnancy  while  they  or  their  partner  are  on  eribulin 
mesylate therapy and up to 3 months after treatment due to the embryotoxic, teratogenic potential of 
eribulin  mesylate.  There  is  no  information  on  the  excretion  of  eribulin  mesylate  or  its  metabolites  in 
animal  breast  milk  which  has  been  reflected  in  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC.  Breastfeeding  is 
contraindicated in patients treated with eribulin mesylate. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
12  clinical  Studies  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  eribulin.  These 
studies  are  listed  in  Table  3  below.  Moreover,  8  in  vivo  studies  and  8  in  vitro  studies  using  human 
biomaterials comprised the clinical pharmacology programme (studies not shown). 
The indication applied for initially was the following: 
  HALAVEN monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with breast cancer who have 
received  at  least  two  chemotherapeutic  regimens  for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease 
(see section 5.1). 
The finally approved indication is as follows: 
  HALAVEN  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  progressed  after  at  least  two  chemotherapeutic  regimens 
for  advanced  disease  (see  section  5.1).  Prior  therapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients were not suitable for these treatments.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Eribulin is administered intravenously twice every 21-day cycle (once on Days 1 and once on Days 8).  
Distribution  
The pharmacokinetics of eribulin are characterized by a rapid distribution phase followed by a 
prolonged elimination phase, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 40 h. It has a large 
volume of distribution (range of means 43 to 114 l/m2).  
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 27/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eribulin has a low protein binding (65, 49 and 50% binding at 100, 500 and 1000 ng/ml). The volume 
of distribution is relatively large with range of means from 43 to 114 L/m2. 
Metabolism 
Eribulin mesylate has 19 chiral centres and is administered as one specific enantiomer. The degree of 
interconversion in man appears small. Although in vitro data suggested eribulin metabolism via 
CYP3A4, an in vivo mass-balance study (see elimination below) showed that drug elimination mainly 
takes place through biliary excretion of unchanged drug. Metabolite concentrations represented <0.6% 
of parent compound, confirming that there are no major human metabolites of eribulin. 
Elimination 
Clearance  is  low  with  average  estimates  varying  from  1.16  to  2.42 l/h/m2  following  a  dose  of 
1.23 mg/m2.  The  terminal  half-life  is  long  (approximately  40  hours).  No  significant  accumulation  of 
eribulin was observed on weekly administration. 
Based on a mass-balance study submitted (data not shown), no or very little metabolism of eribulin 
takes place and no metabolites have been identified in plasma in vivo. Eribulin is mainly eliminated 
through biliary excretion of unchanged drug. This route contributes to 70% of total clearance. The 
transporter involved has not been identified. If the secretion is completely inhibited, it could in theory 
give rise to a more than 3-fold increase in plasma concentrations.  
After administration of 14C-eribulin to patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in 
faeces and 9% in urine indicating that renal clearance is not a significant route of eribulin elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetic properties are not dose or time dependent in the range of eribulin mesylate doses 
of 0.25 to 4.0 mg/m2, but results from one study indicated a decreased clearance with increasing dose 
(data not shown). 
Special populations 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The variability in systemic exposure is relatively large. The coefficient of variation (CV) in AUC was on 
average  about  45%.  In  the  population  analysis  the  inter-individual  variability  in  clearance  not 
explained  by  covariates  was  46%  CV.  The  inter-occasion  (~intra-individual)  variability  was  markedly 
lower being 14 %CV. 
Renal impairment 
A  study  in  patients  with  different  degrees  of  impaired  renal  function  showed  that  the  exposure  of 
eribulin  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  function  (creatinine  clearance≥40  to  59  mL/min,  n=6)  was 
similar to in patients with normal renal function while the exposure in patients with severe impairment 
was increased by 75% (creatinine clearance<40 ml/min, n=4).  
Hepatic impairment 
A  study  evaluated  the  PK  of  eribulin  in  patients  with  mild  (Child-Pugh  A;  n=7)  and  moderate  (Child-
Pugh B; n=4) hepatic impairment due to liver metastases. Compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function (n=6), eribulin exposure increased 1.8-fold and 2.53-fold in patients with mild and moderate 
hepatic  impairment,  respectively.  Administration  of  eribulin  at  a  dose  of  0.97 mg/m2  to  patients  with 
mild  hepatic impairment  and  0.62 mg/m2  to  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  resulted  in  a 
somewhat  higher  exposure  to  eribulin  than  a  dose  of  1.23 mg/m2  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic

function. Eribulin was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). No study 
in patients with hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis has been submitted. 
Age 
There  were  no  indications  from  the  population  analysis  that  age  has  an  impact  on  the  systemic 
exposure  and  the  analysis  included  63  subjects    65  years.  However,  from  a  pharmacokinetic 
perspective there are limited data available for elderly above 80 years of age.  
Weight 
The  variability  in  systemic  exposure  is  to  a  large  extent  explained  by  differences  in  body  weight, 
moreover  the  results  from  the  population  PK  analysis  support  the  Body  surface  area  (BSA)-based 
dosing regimen.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Information  on  pharmacokinetic  interactions  comes  primarily  from  in  vitro  studies  (see  Non-Clinical 
aspects).  
In  clinical  study  E7389-E044-109,  the  DDI  between  ketoconazole  and  eribulin  was  investigated. 
Eribulin 1.23 mg/m2 was injected during 2-5 minutes on day 1 followed by a washout and on day 15 
eribulin  0.62  mg/m2  was  administered  together  with    a  ketoconazole  200  mg  dose,  which  was 
administered  also  the  following  day.  Blood  sampling  was  performed  for  144  hours  after  the  eribulin 
doses.  No  effect  of  ketoconazole  was  observed  (data  not  shown).  Furthermore,  the  population 
pharmacokinetic  model  showed  that  concomitant  administration  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors  or  CYP3A4 
inducers  did  not  alter  the  clearance  of  eribulin.  A  drug-drug  interaction  study  with  eribulin  and  a 
CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) is ongoing. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Tumour responses have been seen in phase–I studies of advanced solid tumours which primarily aimed 
at determining the MTD of eribulin (data not shown).  
Biomarkers for resistance 
Eribulin  has  showed  in  vitro  activity  against  cancer  cells  that  are  taxane-resistant  due  to  ß-tubulin 
mutations.  A  phase-I  study  (NCI-5730)  and  a  phase-II  study  (Study  201)  in  the  present  application 
studied  the  effects  of  class  III  ß-tubulin  mutations  however  both  provided  preliminary  evidence  to 
suggest that the expression of ßIII-tubulin impacted eribulin efficacy in a similar manner as it impacts 
the efficacy of taxanes. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-response 
Exposure-adverse  event  analyses  were  performed  and  models  describing  the  probability  of  fatigue, 
neuropathy and neutropenia were developed.  
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 29/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exposure of eribulin (dose, Cmax or AUC) was not identified as a significant predictor of the probability 
of  fatigue,  but  the  best  predictor  was  stratified  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance  status  (ECOG  0  and  1  vs.  ECOG  2  and  3)  with  an  effect  of  cycle  on  patients  with  ECOG 
status of 0 or 1.  
The  best  model  describing  the  probability  of  neuropathy  used  AUC  multiplied  by  cycle  number  to 
predict the likelihood of neuropathy, in line with that development of neuropathy is cumulative. Finally, 
the  probability  of  a  patient  experiencing  a  Grade  4  neutropenia  was  estimated  to  be  dependent  on 
eribulin exposure (AUC) and AST. The effect of AST in addition to systemic exposure was unexpected 
and there is no evident mechanistic reason.  
QT study 
The study 110 was undertaken in 26 patients without a positive control. QT prolongation was observed 
on  Day 8,  independent  of  eribulin  concentration,  with  no  QT  prolongation  observed  on  Day 1.  As 
eribulin  is  a  cytotoxic  drug,  the  study  was  not  optimal  to  exclude  such  effects  and  a  warning  was 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no issues raised concerning the human pharmacokinetic part of the documentation. However, 
the  applicant  has  been  requested,  as  part  of  the  risk  management  plan,  to  try  to  identify  the  main 
transporters involved in the biliary excretion (main elimination pathway) of eribulin to allow predictions 
of potential drug interactions at transporter level (see section 2.7). 
The effect of hepatic impairment has been investigated in patients with impairment due to metastases. 
This is likely the most common cause of hepatic impairment in the population. Dosing adjustments are 
proposed based on Child Pugh classification.  
The exposure is markedly increased in hepatic impairment (2- and 3-fold in mild and moderate 
impairment respectively). There are no data in severe hepatic impairment but it may be expected that 
the exposure is even further increased. However, it is considered unlikely that patients with severe 
impairment due to metastases will be treated with eribulin and the lack of data is therefore not 
considered an issue to follow up further. The applicant should propose recommendations for patients 
with hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. Furthermore, the applicant should investigate whether, based 
on the hepatic impairment study data, any of the clin. chem. markers within the Child Pugh 
classification may be used for dose adjustment. This information is currently reflected in the RMP (see 
section 2.7). In the mean time, patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should reduce the 
dose of eribulin to 0.97 mg/m2 and 0.62 mg/m2 respectively. Severe hepatic impairment has not been 
studied but it is expected that a more marked dose reduction is needed if eribulin is used in these 
patients. Although patients with impaired liver function due to cirrhosis have not been studied, the 
doses above may be used in mild and moderate impairment. These patients will have to be closely 
monitored as the doses may need readjustment. 
The effect of ethnicity was not studied in specific pharmacokinetic studies. An assessment was included 
in  the  population  PK  analysis  and  no  effect  was  identified.  However,  definite  conclusions  concerning 
ethnicity  cannot  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  population  PK  analysis  since  the  main  part  were 
Caucasian subjects and one portion of the patients had unknown ethnicity. 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 30/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eribulin  is  mainly  eliminated  through  biliary  excretion  (up  to  70%).  Thus,  the  major  source  of 
interactions  affecting  the  pharmacokinetics  of  eribulin  will  be  caused  by  inhibition  or  induction  of  the 
involved transporters which are unknown.  
Eribulin should not be used concomitantly with inhibitors of hepatic transport proteins such as organic 
anion-transporting proteins (OATPs), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistant proteins (MRPs) as 
described in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The  applicant  will  investigate  which  transporter  is  involved  to  allow  predictions  of  potential  drug 
interactions  at  transporter  level.  While  this  is  investigated,  the  applicant  will  include  a  list  of  potent 
inhibitors  of  hepatic  uptake  and  efflux  transporters  in  the  SmPC  and  propose  adequate  practically 
applicable  treatment  recommendations  for  situations  where  concomitant  treatment  is  needed.  These 
additional investigations regarding transporters are addressed in the RMP (see section 2.7).  
Preclinical studies suggest that P-gp can transport eribulin.  
An interaction study with ketoconazole showed no effect on eribulin exposure. Available results indicate 
that ketoconazole inhibits P-gp but interaction studies with P-gp probe substrates are lacking. Thus the 
lack  of  interaction  cannot  be  extrapolated  to  potent  P-gp  inhibitors  (see  SmPC  section  4.5).  The 
applicant  will  therefore  present  in  vivo  data  supporting  ketoconazole  as  a  P-gp  inhibitor  and  discuss 
whether ketoconazole is less potent that the CYP3A4 inhibitors used in the clinical studies as described 
in the RMP (see section 2.7). 
Concomitant treatment with enzyme inducing drugs such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St 
John´s  wort  (Hypericum  perforatum)  is  not  recommended  as  these  drugs  are  likely  to  give  rise  to 
markedly reduced plasma concentrations of eribulin. 
No drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors unless they are potent inhibitors of P-gp. 
Eribulin exposure (AUC and C max) was unaffected by ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
Eribulin may inhibit the important drug metabolising enzyme CYP3A4. This is indicated by in vitro data 
and  no  in  vivo  data  is  available. Concomitant  use  with  drugs  that  are  mainly metabolised  by  CYP3A4 
should be made with caution and it is recommended that the patient is closely monitored for adverse 
effects  due  to  increased  plasma  concentrations  of  the  concomitantly  used  drug.  If  the  drug  has  a 
narrow  therapeutic  range,  concomitant  use  should  be  avoided.  Eribulin  does  not  inhibit  the  CYP 
enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 at relevant clinical concentrations. 
CYP2C19 is not induced by eribulin. This provides some support for lack of Pregnane X receptor (PXR) 
mediated induction by eribulin but no definitive conclusions can be drawn. No further induction studies 
are required, however, the applicant is encouraged to investigate this further. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The phase I program consisted of: 
- 
- 
one National Institute of Health (NIH)-sponsored study, NCI-5730, and  
two studies sponsored by the applicant, Study 101 and Study 102.  
A total of 94 patients with refractory or advanced solid tumours were enrolled in these three studies. 
The NCI-5730 study and Study 101 both used a dosing regimen of Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days, 
and the MTD in these studies was determined to be 1.4 mg/m2 and 1.0 mg/m2 (as eribulin mesylate) 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 31/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively. Study 102 used a dosing schedule of Day 1 every 21 days, and the MTD was determined 
to be 2.0 mg/m2 as eribulin mesylate. 
The dosing regimen of the pivotal study (1.23 mg/m2 eribulin on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) was 
selected  based  on  results  of  two  completed  phase  II  studies  (Study  201  and  202)which  were  both 
initiated with a dosing regimen of 1.23 mg/m2 eribulin on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days. A second 
cohort  of  patients  was  added  to  both  these  studies  to  evaluate  the  21-day  dosing  regimen.  In  the 
breast cancer study 201(n= 103 in full ITT population) the 21-day regimen showed numerically better 
results with regard to ORR, PFS and OS along with better tolerability. Another phase II-study in breast 
cancer  (Study  211,  n=291  in  ITT  population)  was  then  undertaken  which  also  showed  acceptable 
tolerability of the 21-day dosing regimen. (Efficacy results for studies 201 and 211 are shown in Table 
15 under Supportive studies).

Eribulin was administered as an IV bolus at 1.23 mg/m2 over two to five minutes, on Days 1 and 8 of a 
21-day cycle.  
The  TPC  was  defined  as  any  single  agent  chemotherapy,  hormonal  treatment  or  biological  therapy 
approved for the treatment of cancer; or best supportive care or radiotherapy, administered according 
CHMP assessment report

to local practice, if applicable. The use of other investigational drugs, or products not registered for the 
treatment of cancer was not allowed. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The objectives, endpoints and their definitions are shown in Table 4. 
Table 4. Objectives and endpoints 
Primary objective 
Primary endpoint and definition 
1. To compare the overall survival of 
patients treated with eribulin versus TPC. 
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of 
randomization until death from any cause. Patients who were lost to 
follow-up were censored at the date last known alive. Patients who 
were alive on the data cut-off date (12 May 2009) were censored at 
the data cut-off date for OS analyses.  
Secondary objectives 
Secondary endpoints and definitions 
2. To compare progression-free survival 
between the two treatment groups. 
3. To assess objective tumour response 
rate as measured using “Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors” 
(RECIST) criteria. 
4. To compare the duration of response in 
each treatment group. 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from the 
date of randomization until PD (by clinical evaluation or as 
documented by RECIST criteria from Independent review, see below) 
or death from any cause in the absence of disease progression. 
Patients who were alive and progression-free on the data cut-off date 
were censored at the data cut-off date.  
Objective tumour Response Rate (ORR), defined as the number 
of patients with a confirmed (see below) CR or confirmed PR divided 
by the number of patients in the analysis population. The response 
rate was based on the Independent review of disease assessments. 
Subjects with unknown or missing response were treated as non-
responders. 
Duration of Response (DoR), defined as the time from first 
documented evidence of complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) (whichever status is recorded first) until the first documented 
sign of disease progression or death due to any cause. For patients 
in the subset of responders who did not progress or die, duration of 
response was censored. Response was derived from the Independent 
review of best response. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted 
based on the investigator’s disease assessments. 
5. To collect and investigate safety 
parameters for all patients. 
Frequency and severity of Adverse Events (AEs), 
laboratory measurements, concomitant medication, and study drug 
exposure. 
Tumour  assessments  were  performed  according  to  RECIST  criteria  using  Magnetic  resonance  imaging 
(MRI)  or  spiral/multidetector  Computed  tomography  with  IV  or  oral  contrast,  as  appropriate. 
Ultrasound  was  not  to  be  used.  Superficial  lesions  were  measured  with  calliper  and/or  ruler,  and 
documented  by  photography  including  a  ruler.  If  a  lesion  was  assessable  by  both  radiological  and 
clinical  techniques,  radiological  techniques  were  to  be  used.  The  same  imaging/assessment  modality 
was to be used on measurable disease at all time points. The tumour response was analysed according 
to  a)  Investigator  assessment,  and  b)  Independent  review  blinded  to  patient  ID  and  allocated 
treatment.  The  latter  was  used  for  the  primary  analyses  of  the  secondary  endpoints  PFS  and  tumour 
response.  
A maximum of 10 target  lesions were selected to be measured (maximum 5 from each tumour site). 
All other lesions were defined as non-target lesions, and were followed only as “present” or “absent”. 
Response assessments were performed every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week), or sooner if suspicion of disease 
progression.

 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 34/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Confirmation  of  tumour  response  (CR  or  PR)  was  to  be  performed  by  a  second  examination  no  less 
than four weeks after first observation of response. Only confirmed responses were considered CR or 
PR for the best response and included in the ORR.  
Sample size 
A  total  of  762  patients  were  randomised  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  eribulin  or  TPC.  Initially  a  lower 
number of 630 patients (420 in eribulin and 210 in TPC) were planned, but this was amended following 
a  pre-planned  evaluation  of  the  event  rate  (pre-specified  in  the  protocol),  15  months  after  the  first 
patient  was  recruited  (January  2008).  The  primary  analysis  was  thus  planned  to  occur  when  411 
events  (deaths)  had  been  recorded  in  630  patients,  leading  to  an  initial  estimated  maximum  study 
duration of 26.5 months. The pooled event rate evaluation suggested that the number of events was 
smaller than expected, and therefore a decision was made to increase the sample size to allow up to a 
maximum of 1000 patients in order to achieve the required number of deaths sooner. Sample size re-
assessment was done on an ongoing basis in a blinded fashion. As soon as it became apparent that the 
411 events (deaths) would be reached within a reasonable timeframe, recruitment was stopped. These 
sample  size  re-assessments  were  conducted  in-house  by  a  statistician  who  was  blinded  to  treatment 
assignment. The pooled event rate was communicated to the immediate study management team for 
decision  making  purposes.  The  study  team  did  not  have  access  to  the  relative  efficacy  data  per 
treatment arm.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either eribulin or TPC. 
Stratification:  
Patients were pre-stratified based on the following three factors:  
1. Geographic regions:  Region  1:  North  America/Western  Europe/Australia  (i.e.  Australia,  Belgium, 
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA.) 
Region  2:  Eastern  Europe  (i.e.  Croatia,  the  Czech  Republic,  Hungary,  Poland, 
Russia and Turkey.) 
Region 3: Latin America/South Africa (i.e. Argentina, Brazil and South Africa.) 
2. HER2/neu status: 
 positive / negative / unknown  
3. Prior treatment with capecitabine:   yes / no  
Randomisation procedure:  
Prior  to  randomisation  (and  after  evaluation  for  eligibility),  the  proposed  TPC  agent  that  would  have 
been given if the patient was randomised to TPC had to be defined and confirmed by the Investigator 
using the Interactive voice recognition system (IVRS). Once the TPC had been defined, patients were 
randomised to eribulin or TPC treatment within each stratum in a 2:1 ratio (eribulin to TPC). Treatment 
allocation and a randomization number were given for each patient. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  was  an  open  label  study.  However,  the  sponsor  study  team  was  blinded  for  OS  data  until 
database  lock  to  avoid  potential  bias.  Independent  statisticians  conducted  the  interim  analysis,  and 
assisted  with  queries  surrounding  all  death  events.  An  independent  data  monitoring  committee  was 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 35/70
 
 
 
 
 
 
used  to  review  the  safety  of  eribulin  treatment  in  the  study  and  to  assess  interim  efficacy  data  to 
determine whether the study should continue as planned. The sponsor study team did not have access 
to the interim data. 
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint, OS 
Primary analysis: OS in ITT population, using a two-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level 
of 0.049 (adjusted for the interim analysis). The ITT population was defined as patients who were 
randomised irrespective of whether or not they actually received the treatment they were randomised 
to. The PP population included all patients in the ITT population who met the major inclusion criteria 
and who did not have any major protocol violation.

Conduct of the study 
Study 305 was conducted in 135 centres in 19 countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, 
Croatia,  Czech  Republic,  France,  Germany,  Hungary,  Italy,  Poland,  Russia,  South  Africa,  Spain, 
Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. 
The TPC arm consisted of 97% chemotherapy (26% vinorelbine, 18% gemcitabine, 18% capecitabine, 
16% taxane, 9% anthracycline, 10% other chemotherapy), or 3% hormonal therapy. 
Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol was issued on April 26, 2006. Four amendments were made to the protocol, 
and  a  final  protocol  was  produced  on  March  03,  2009.  The  first  amendment  was  made  before  first 
patient in, November 16, 2006. Major amendments are listed below. 
Amendment 1 (8 August 2006):  
Reasons  for  Amendments:  Incorporating  scientific  advice  from  EMEA  and  updating  administrative 
changes. 
  Added  as  inclusion  criterion  that  patients  must  have  proved  refractory  to  the  most  recent 
chemotherapy, documented by progression on or within six months of therapy. 
  Allowed  patients  without  measurable  disease  to  be  enrolled  since  the  primary  objective  was 
OS. 
  Amended stratifications factors to include prior capecitabine. 
Amendment 2 (4 January 2008): 
  Allowed  patients  who  commenced  bisphosphonates  after  starting  study  treatment  to  continue 
in the study on agreement with the sponsor. 
  Changed the Eligible Population to the PP Population, to allow inclusion of patients that did not 
have major protocol violations in the PP Population. 
Amendment 3 (5 June 2008): 
 
Increased  population  size  to  approximately  1000  patients  in  order  to  achieve  the  number  of 
events required for the primary analysis sooner. 
Protocol deviations 
Forty-four of the patients (8.7%) in the eribulin group and 33 patients (13.0%) in the TPC group were 
excluded from the PP population due to deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
The most frequently observed deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria concerned the patient not 
being refractory to the most recent chemotherapy, occurring in 16 (3.1%) in the eribulin group and 11 
(4.3%) in the TPC group; followed by having received more than five prior chemotherapy regimens in 
15  (3.0%)  patients  in  the  eribulin  group  and  9  (3.5%)  patients  in  the  TPC  group;  and  the  patient 
having received only one regimen for locally recurrent or metastatic disease in 7 (1.4%) patients in the 
eribulin  group  and  8(3.1%)  in  the  TPC  group.  An  additional  10  patients  were  excluded  from  the  PP 
population because they did not receive study treatment.  
Protocol  deviations  that  did  not  cause  exclusion  from  the  PP  population  included  among  others: 
randomised with brain metastasis, concomitant treatment with anti-hormonal agents, bisphosphonates

or warfarin, error in BSA calculation leading to patient being underdosed, and patient receiving study 
drug after disease progression.

Numbers analysed 
One patient received eribulin instead of TPC, which she was randomised to, and was included in the 
TPC group in the ITT population, excluded from the PP population, and included in the eribulin group in 
the safety population. The ITT population for study 305 was 762 patients in total (Eribulin n=508 and 
TPC n=254) and the PP population was 675 in total (Eribulin n=459 and TPC n=216).

Duration of response 
The median response duration in this population by independent review was 128 days (95% CI: 116,

Investigator assessment. 
Ancillary analyses  
Taxane-refractory vs. non-refractory patients 
The  original  analysis  of  the  effect  of  eribulin  in  relation  to  type  and  refractoriness  of  prior  lines  of 
therapy revealed that patients refractory (defined as progression within 2 months of therapy) to prior 
taxane treatment had no discernible advantage of eribulin compared with TPC with regard to OS, HR: 
0.98  (95%  CI  0.74,  1.30),  whereas  patients  not  refractory  to  taxanes  had  a  clear  statistically 
significant benefit of eribulin over TPC, HR: 0.63 (95% CI 0.46, 0.87).  
For  the  other  tubulin-targeting  drug  used,  vinorelbine,  a  better  HR  of  0.56  (95%  CI  0.38,  0.83)  was 
seen  for  refractory  patients  compared  with  patients  not  refractory  to  vinorelbine,  HR  0.86  (95%  CI 
0.68, 1.10). 
In  the  updated  OS  analysis,  the  HR  for  eribulin  vs.  TPC  in  the  taxane-refractory  patients  (defined  as 
progression within 60 days of taxane therapy) has decreased compared with the original analysis, from 
0.98 (95% CI 0.74, 1.30) to 0.90 (95% CI 0.71, 1.14). At the same time the HR in the taxane non-
refractory group has increased from 0.63 (95% CI 0.0.46, 0.87) to 0.73 (95% CI 0.56, 0.96), and the 
point  estimates  from  both  groups  are  within  the  CI  of  the  other  (see  figure  3).  In  the  Investigator 
assessment-based  analysis  of  PFS  (based  on  original  data  cut-off),  the  HR  was  0.77  (95%  CI  0.61, 
0.97) for taxane-refractory patients and 0.76 (95% CI 0.58, 0.99) for patients not taxane-refractory.

Note:  Hazard  ratio  is  calculated  with  TPC  as  the  reference  group  based  on  stratified  Cox  regression  adjusted  for 
HER2/neu status, prior capecitabine treatment and geographical region as strata. 
Note:  All  prior  episodes  of  chemotherapy  were  considered,  including  therapies  for  neo-adjuvant,  adjuvant  and 
metastatic  disease.    For  missing  dates  where  timing  could  not  be  determined  these  were  considered  as 
nonrefractory. 
Note: A smaller hazard ratio is in favour of eribulin.

Capecitabine-naive versus capecitabine pre-treated patients 
In the initial OS/ITT analysis, patients refractory to capecitabine showed a statistically significant HR of 
0.68  (95%  CI  0.53,  0.88)  for  eribulin  vs.  TPC,  whereas  in  patients  not  refractory  to  capecitabine  no 
advantage  for  eribulin  over  TPC  was  seen,  HR:  1.13  (95%  CI  0.80,  1.60).  Similar  differences  were 
seen  when  the  analysis  was  based  on  prior  capecitabine  treatment  received/not  received:  HR  for 
eribulin vs. TPC in patients with prior capecitabine was 0.771 (0.612, 0.973), and in patients without 
prior capecitabine 0.943 (0.617, 1.443).  
The updated OS analysis of the capecitabine pre-treated subgroup showed results consistent with the 
original  analysis.  The  positive  effect  on  OS  was  seen  both  in  capecitabine-naïve  and  in  capecitabine 
pre-treated patient groups. The analysis of updated OS showed a survival benefit for the eribulin group 
compared to TPC both in capecitabine pre-treated patients with a HR of 0.787 (95% CI 0.645, 0.961), 
and  for  the  capecitabine-naïve  patients  with  a  corresponding  HR  of  0.865  (95%  CI  0.606,  1.233). 
Investigator assessment-based analysis of PFS (based on original data cut-off), also showed a positive 
effect in the capecitabine pre-treated group with a HR of 0.68 (0.56, 0.83). For the capecitabine-naïve 
group the corresponding HR was 1.03 (0.73, 1.45).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No OS analyses performed across trials were submitted. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  eribulin  in  renal  dysfunction  was  investigated  in  a  newly  reported  study 
conducted  by  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  in  21  patients  with  advanced  urothelial  cancer 
(Synold  et  al  2010),  included  in  the  D120  responses.  Of  20  evaluable  patients,  response  rate  was 
20%,1 CR and 3 PR, (95% CI: 7%, 42%). Of 10 patients with SD, 3 patients had unconfirmed PR on 6 
week scans but PD at 12 weeks. At median follow-up of 15.8 months, median progression free survival 
was 4.1 months (19 patients progressed); median survival was 9.7 months.  
Efficacy results of PK Study 108 in hepatic impairment have not been reported.  
Sub-group  analysis  of  Study  305  (original  data  cut-off)  showed  that  the  HRs  for  OS  according  to 
hepatic  and  renal  function  favoured  eribulin  for  all  subgroups  for  which  there  were  sufficient  data  to 
allow a comparison. None of the HRs were statistically significant, except the one for the small group 
with CTC grade 2 baseline AST (also in favour of eribulin), which may be a chance finding.  
HRs  for  OS  according  to  age,  race  and  geographic  region  favoured  eribulin  in  most  subgroups  (not 
statistically significant for any subgroup).  
Supportive studies 
There were 2 supportive studies (Study 201 and study 211) submitted with the application. 
Study 201 
Study  201  was  an  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  proof  of  concept,  Phase  II  study  investigating 
the efficacy and safety of eribulin in patients with LRBC or MBC previously treated with chemotherapy 
including an anthracycline and a taxane. Eribulin was initially given at a dose of 1.23 mg/m2 as a five 
minute IV bolus on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (n=71). Because of the high number of dose 
delays,  reductions,  or  omissions  due  to  neutropenia  on  Day  15,  the  protocol  was  amended  and  a 
second  cohort  of  patients  (n=33)  was  added  to  explore  an  alternative  regimen  administering  eribulin 
on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, at the same dose of 1.23 mg/m2 IV over five minutes.  
A total of 104 patients were enrolled in Study 201; 103 patients received treatment, and 87 patients 
were  included  in  the  PP  population.  Patients  were  heavily  pre-treated,  having  received  a median  of  4 
prior chemotherapy regimens (range 1 to 11). Patients in the 28-day cohort received a median of 2.5 
cycles  of  eribulin  therapy,  compared  with  a  median  of  4  cycles  in  the  21-day  cohort.  ORR  was  the 
primary  endpoint.  Secondary  objectives  included  among  others  Quality  of  Life  and  tumour 
pharmacogenetics in relation to response.  
Study 211 
Study  211  was  a  Phase  II,  open-label,  single-arm  study  that  investigated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
eribulin  in  patients  with  LRBC  or  MBC  previously  treated  with  an  anthracycline,  a  taxane,  and 
capecitabine  therapy.  Eligible  patients  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  had  to  have  histologically  or 
cytologically confirmed  LRBC  or  MBC,  two  to  five  prior  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  regimens,  of  which  at 
least one had to be given for advanced disease, progression on or within six months of the last prior 
chemotherapy  regimen,  and  measurable  disease  as  assessed  by  Independent  radiological  review.  All 
patients were to receive eribulin (1.23 mg/m2) administered as a 2-5 minute IV bolus on Days 1 and 8 
of a 21-day cycle. 
A  total  of  299  patients  were  enrolled  and  291  were  treated;  269  were  evaluable  and  met  the  key 
enrolment criteria based on an independent eligibility review committee (Eligible Population). Patients

were  extensively  pre-treated,  with  a  median  of  4  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  (range  1  to  6).  The 
median number of cycles of eribulin therapy received per patient was 4 (range 1 to 27). 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  ORR  as  determined  by  Independent  radiographic  review.  The  primary 
analysis was based on the Eligible Population. Secondary objective was to evaluate PK/PD relationships 
in a population PK study.  
Results 
The phase II Studies 201 and 211 were performed in patients with LRBC or MBC previously treated 
with chemotherapy including an anthracycline and a taxane (and capecitabine in Study 211). Efficacy

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The 762 patients in the pivotal Study 305 were women with late stage breast cancer, having received 
at least 2 prior regimens for advanced disease. They had already received anthracyclines and taxanes 
as per protocol, and 73% had also received capecitabine (a stratification factor at randomisation). The 
high proportion of metastasis to the liver (around 60%) and lung (near 40%) indicates that the patient 
population as a group is in a very advanced stage of disease. 
The  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  with  an  overall  survival  result  that  was  statistically  significantly 
better  in  the  eribulin  group  compared  to  TPC  at  55%  of  events.  The  median  survival  of  the  Halaven 
group (median: 399 days/13.1 months) compared with the TPC group (median: 324 days/10.6 months) 
improved by 75 days/2.5 months (HR 0.809, 95% CI: 0.660, 0.991, p=0.041). 
The  baseline  data  are  overall  well  balanced,  although  with  small  differences  (3-4%  of  patients)  in 
favour  of  eribulin  with  regard  to  the  number  of  patients  with  liver  and  lymph  node  metastasis,  and 
very  slight  differences  (1-3%)  regarding  number  of  organs  involved,  triple-negative  tumours  (with 
regard to ER, PgR and HER2 status), and performance status 0. Cancer stage is also in favour of the 
eribulin  group,  with  7%  (41.8%  –  35%)  more  patients  in  stage  II  and  7%  (23.2%  –  15.9%)  less 
patients in stage IV, compared with the TPC group. In both groups 28% of the patients had stage III 
disease.  Regarding  the  number  of  organs  involved,  50.6%  in  the  eribulin  group  had  1-2  involved 
organs,  compared  with  46.1%  in  the  TPC  group.  The  prior  anti-cancer  therapy  was  overall  well 
balanced between the eribulin and the TPC groups. Small differences were seen in the number of prior

therapies (chemotherapy/hormonal), and patients in the eribulin group tended to have a fewer number 
of  prior  therapies,  e.g.  in  the  eribulin  group  52%  of  patients  had  received  4-6  prior  cytostatic 
treatments  compared  with  approximately  55%  in  the  TPC  group.  The  corresponding  figures  for 
hormonal therapy were 8 % and 10%, respectively. 
However,  since  using  a  single  pivotal  trial  for  this  application,  strong  support  from  other  outcome 
measures  are  required,  most  importantly  PFS.  In  this  Investigator  assessed  PFS  did  support  the 
primary  endpoint  (p=0.002),  with  HR  0.76  (95%  CI  0.64,  0.90).  A  high  concordance  was  observed 
between the Independent review and Investigator assessment, and important bias in the adjudication 
by the investigators can be excluded.  
This result was confirmed with an updated overall survival analysis carried out at 77% of events with 
the  median  survival  of  the  eribulin  group  (median:  403  days/13.2  months)  compared  with  the  TPC 
group (median: 321 days/10.5 months) improved by 82 days/2.7 months (HR 0.805, 95% CI: 0.677, 
0.958, nominal p=0.014). 
In  response  evaluable  patients  who  received  eribulin,  the  objective  response  rate  by  the  RECIST 
criteria  was  12.2%  (95%  CI:  9.4%,  15.5%)  by  independent  review  and  13.2%  (95%  CI:  10.3%, 
16.7%) by investigator review. The median response duration in this population by independent review 
was 128 days (95% CI: 116, 152 days) (4.2 months). 
The  positive  effect  on  OS  and  PFS  was  seen  in  both  taxane-refractory  and  non-refractory  groups  of 
patients. In the OS update, the HR for eribulin versus TPC was 0.90 (95% CI 0.71, 1.14) in favour of 
eribulin for taxane-refractory patients and 0.73 (95% CI 0.56, 0.96) for patients not taxane-refractory. 
In the Investigator assessment-based analysis of PFS (based on original data cut-off), the HR was 0.77 
(95%  CI  0.61,  0.97)  for  taxane-refractory  patients  and  0.76  (95%  CI  0.58,  0.99)  for  patients  not 
taxane-refractory. 
The positive effect on OS was seen both in capecitabine-naïve and in capecitabine pre-treated patient 
groups. The analysis of updated OS showed a survival benefit for the eribulin group compared to TPC 
both  in  capecitabine  pre-treated  patients  with  a  HR  of  0.787  (95%  CI  0.645,  0.961),  and  for  the 
capecitabine-naïve  patients  with  a  corresponding  HR  of  0.865  (95%  CI  0.606,  1.233).  Investigator 
assessment-based analysis of PFS (based on original data cut-off), also showed a positive effect in the 
capecitabine  pre-treated  group  with  a  HR  of  0.68  (0.56,  0.83).  For  the  capecitabine-naïve  group  the 
corresponding HR was 1.03 (0.73, 1.45). 
The  single-arm  studies  201  and  211  both  showed  activity  of  eribulin  in  heavily  pre-treated  breast 
cancer patients, i.e. populations similar to that of the pivotal Study 305. The results are poorer than in 
Study 305, particularly in Study 211 which required prior treatment with capecitabine, unlike the other 
two studies.  
A  direct  comparison  of  capecitabine  and  eribulin  as  3rd  line  treatment  in  mBC  would  be  of  interest. 
Currently, the ongoing randomised Phase 3 study 301 investigates the efficacy of eribulin compared to 
capecitabine in the 2nd line setting. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clinically relevant and statistically significant difference in overall survival has been demonstrated for 
eribulin  compared  with  the  active  comparator  arm  with  a  difference  in  median  OS  77  days  (2.5 
months),  and  difference  in  1-year  OS  rate  10%,  p=  0.041  in  the  original  OS  analysis  based  on  55% 
event  rate.  This  is  further  supported  by  an  updated  OS  analysis  with  77%  event  rate  which  showed 
consistent results and a lower p-value (0.014).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of eribulin has been evaluated in 12 completed clinical studies in different indications, listed 
in  Table  3.  The  main  eribulin  safety  populations  considered  included  the  population  of  Study  305 
(n=503),  the  Breast  Cancer  Population  (BCP,  n=  827)  and  the  All  Eribulin  Treated  Population  (AETP, 
n=1222).  The  BCP  included  patients  in  the  3  efficacy  breast  cancer  studies  305,  201  and  211  who 
received  the  target  dose  applied  for.  The  AETP  included  11  of  the  12  completed  safety  studies 
sponsored  by  the  applicant  (one  Japanese  phase-I  study  on  15  patients  was  not  included  because  a 
translation  of  results  was  not  available  at  the  time  of  analysis  of  the  pooled  population).  The 
populations are thus to a high  degree overlapping, where Study 305 constitutes 61% of the BCP and 
41% of the AETP, and the BCP makes up 68% of the AETP. In total, 74% of the patients in the AETP 
were breast cancer patients.

For each row category, a subject with two or more AEs in that category is counted only once. 
In Study 305, the most frequently reported (reported for 20% or more of patients) AEs among patients 
treated  with  eribulin  were  asthenia/fatigue  (53.7%),  neutropenia  (51.7%),  alopecia  (44.5%), 
peripheral  neuropathy  (34.6%),  nausea  (34.6%),  constipation  (24.7%),  leucopenia  (23.1%), 
arthalgia/myalgia (21.7%), weight decreased (21.3%), and pyrexia (20.9%).  
The majority of the common AEs (regardless of relationship) were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. Neutropenia, 
leucopenia,  peripheral  neuropathy,  and  asthenia/fatigue  were  the  most  common  AEs  reported  at 
CTCAE  Grades  3  and  4.  Neutropenia  was  the  most  common  AE  reported  at  CTCAE  Grade  4  in  the 
eribulin group (24.1%). 
In the pooled analysis, the most frequently reported AEs were asthenia/fatigue, neutropenia, alopecia, 
nausea,  and  peripheral  neuropathy.  In  the  BCP,  neutropenia  (54.5%),  asthenia/fatigue  (52.8%), 
alopecia (49.7%), nausea (35.1%), peripheral neuropathy (32.0%), leucopenia (22.1%), and anaemia 
(20.3%)  were  the  most  frequently  reported  (reported  for  20%  or  more  of  patients)  adverse  drug 
reactions. 
The AEs in the pooled populations are shown in greater detail in the following Table 20.

Serious AEs were reported for 29 and 27% of the subjects in the All Eribulin Treated and Breast Cancer 
populations,  respectively.  In  both  populations,  the  five  most  commonly  reported  serious  AEs  were 
febrile  neutropenia  (47  [3.8%]  and  32  [3.9%]),  pyrexia  (29  [2.4%]  and  18  [2.2%]),  dyspnoea  (24 
[2.0%] and 16 [1.9%]), neutropenia (21 [1.7%] and 16 [1.9%]), and pleural effusion (19 [1.6%] and 
14 [1.7%].

In  the  All  Eribulin  Treated  Population,  152  (42.4%)  subjects  had  AEs  that  were  reported  as  at  least 
possibly related to treatment by the investigator, respectively. In the Breast Cancer population, serious 
AEs  were  reported  as  at  least  possibly  related  to  treatment  by  the  investigator  for  101  (45.1%) 
subjects, respectively.  
In  both  the  All  Eribulin  Treated  and  Breast  Cancer  Populations,  serious  AEs  of  febrile  neutropenia 
(43/47  [91.5%]  and  29/32  [90.6%]),  neutropenia  (19/21  [90.5%]  and  14/16  [87.5%]),  and 
peripheral neuropathy (5/6 [83.3%] and 5/5 [100%]) were considered  probably related to treatment 
by the investigator for most subjects, with the other serious AEs being considered possibly related to 
treatment. A large proportion of cases of pyrexia were considered possibly or probably related in both 
populations (19/29 [65.5%] subjects and 13/18 [72.2%] subjects, respectively). Similarly, pulmonary 
embolism was considered probably or possibly related in 6/16 [37.5%] and 3/7 [42.9%] cases. 
With the exception of one Grade 5 serious AE (a death), all other serious AEs of febrile neutropenia in 
both populations (46 [3.8%] and 31 [3.8%] respectively), were Grade 3+4. In each population, there 
were  5/6  [83.3%]  and  4/5  [80%]  subjects  with  Grade  3+4  serious  TEAEs  of  peripheral  neuropathy, 
respectively 
Deaths 
Table 21 provides a listing of all AEs with outcome of death that is not due to disease progression in 
breast  cancer  studies  201,  211  and  305.  Of  the  21  deaths,  7  were  considered  possibly  or  probably 
related to treatment by the investigator.

Fasting was not required prior to blood sampling for glucose measurements. 
Hypophosphataemia was the most frequent abnormal chemistry laboratory value (defined as a change 
of at least 2 CTCAE grades from grade 0-2 at baseline or a change from grade 3-4 to a higher value) in 
the pooled populations, occurring in 6% of both populations.  
Hyperglycaemia  was  the  second  most  frequent  abnormal  chemistry  value,  occurring  in  5%  of  the 
patients in the AETP, and 4 % in the BCP.  
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  who  experienced  the  most  frequently  reported  abnormal 
haematological values at any post-baseline visit are summarized in Table 23.  
Abnormal absolute neutrophil count was the most common haematological abnormality. In the Breast 
Cancer Population, abnormal Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) values were reported for approximately

Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Eribulin  is  minimally  excreted  via  the  kidney.  Sub-group  analysis  of  the  pooled  safety  populations 
based  on  baseline  creatinine  clearance  showed  trends  of  higher  frequencies  of  treatment-related  AE 
any  grade  and  grade  3-4,  and  neutropenia  in  patients  with  serum-creatinine  clearance  levels  below 
normal, but the groups with low values were small, together less than 15% of the populations. In this 
setting  an  abnormal  creatinine  value  is  likely  to  be  related  to  a  poorer  disease  status  overall,  hence 
these data may not specifically reflect an independent effect of eribulin on renal impairment.  
A newly reported NCI sponsored phase I study of renal impairments (Synold et al 2010) in 21 patients 
with  advanced  urothelial  cancer  showed  a  MTD  of  1.23  mg/m2  eribulin  (which  is  the  normal  dose 
applied for) in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (defined as creatinine clearance ≥40-59 mL/m, 
Cockroft-Gault),  and  no  dose  limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  were  seen.  In  patients  with  severe  renal 
dysfunction (creatinine clearance 20-40 mL/m, not needing dialysis) 1 of 6 patients at 1.23 mg/m2 had 
DLT (grade 3 muscle weakness and grade 3 hypoalbuminemia). The eribulin exposure was increased in 
patients  with  creatinine  clearance  below  30-40  ml/min,  which  could  be  caused  by  reduced  biliary 
transporter expression.  
Hepatic impairment 
The  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  eribulin  exposure  was  studied  in  Study  108  (n=17).  The  study 
showed  that  hepatic  impairment  increased  the  mean  dose-normalized  eribulin  Cmax,  and  increased 
exposure to eribulin.  
Patients in the AETP and BCP with abnormal serum liver function values (bilirubin, ALT and AST) had 
more  grade  ≥  3  treatment-related  AEs  and  SAEs.  Specifically,  all  types  and  grades  of  neutropenia 
events  increased  consistently  with  increasingly  pathological  laboratory  values  for  all  three 
measurements,  and  peripheral  neuropathy  increased  with  ALT  /AST,  whereas  asthenia/fatigue 
appeared  not  to  be  affected.  Patients  with  ALT  or  AST  >  3 x ULN  experienced  a  higher  incidence  of 
Grade  4  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia.  Although  data  are  limited,  patients  with  bilirubin  > 
1.5 x ULN also have a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia 
(The  dose  of  eribulin  was  reduced  according  to  protocol  in  cases  of  grade ≥3  non-haematological 
toxicity. Toxicity reverted to grade ≤2 before next treatment.)

The present application only concerns women in the advanced breast cancer population. A minority of 
men were included in the AETP in non-breast cancer studies. Women had more treatment-related AEs 
of interest including grade 3-4 events.  
Race 
The  vast  majority  of  patients  in  the  AETP  and  BCP  were  white,  constituting  83%  of  patients  in  both 
populations.  The  other  races  included  were  Black:  5  and  4%  of  the  AETP  and  BCP,  respectively, 
Asian/Pacific Islander: 2 and 1 %, and Other: 5 and 3%, respectively.  
No  meaningful  differences  were  seen  in  AEs  of  special  interest,  including  neutropenia,  febrile 
neutropenia, asthenia/fatigue, peripheral neuropathy or alopecia, nor in all TEAEs of any grade, SAEs. 
The duration of exposure was similar across groups. 
Age 
In the AETP (n= 1222), 244 patients (20.0%) were >65 to 75 years of age and 66 subjects (5.4%) 
were >75 years of age. The median duration of exposure and dose intensity was the same for all age 
groups, as were the frequencies of any treatment-related AEs and SAEs, including neutropenia and 
peripheral neuropathy. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses showed that eribulin exposure in 
elderly subjects was similar to that in younger subjects.  
Among the 827 of these patients who received the recommended dose of eribulin in the Phase 2/3 
breast cancer studies, 121 patients (14.6%) were > 65 - 75 years of age and 17 patients (2.1%) were 
> 75 years of age. The safety profile of eribulin in elderly patients (> 65 years of age) was similar to 
that of patients ≤ 65 years of age therefore no dose adjustments was considered necessary for the 
elderly population. Data in patients > 80 years of age is limited.  
Immunological events 
There were no anaphylactoid reactions reported. First dose hypersensitivity reactions occurred in only 
1% of subjects of the AETP and BCP. The frequency was 1% in both patients who received and ones 
who did not receive (anti-emetic) therapy with corticosteroids and/or H1 antihistamine on Day 1 Cycle 
1.  In  all  cycles,  grade  3-4  allergic  conditions  that  occurred  on  or  within  2  days  of  first  dose  were 
reported for 10 (0.8%) and 9 (1.1%) subjects, respectively. Sixteen MedDRA Preferred terms that can 
be  related  to  allergic  reactions,  including  Hypersensitivity  terms,  different  Rash  and  Pruritus  terms, 
Angio-oedema, Face oedema, and Flush, among others, affected 98 (8 %) patients of the AETP and 74 
(9 %) of the BCP; grade ≥ 3 events constituted 0.3 and 0.2%, respectively.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  identified  based  on  PK  data  so  far  but  the  transport 
protein  involved  in  the  biliary  excretion  of  eribulin,  which  is  the  main  elimination  pathway,  has  not 
been identified (see discussion on Clinical Safety).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment  discontinuation  due  to  AE  occurred  in  168  (14%)  patients  in  the  AETP;  71  (6%)  of  these 
were considered not related, while 97 (8%) were considered possibly/probably related. In the BCP 107 
(13%) patients had any AE leading to treatment discontinuation; for 41 (5%) these were not related, 
66 (8%) were possibly/probably related (see Table 19-beginning of safety section).  
AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  included  among  others:  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia, 
asthenia/fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and vomiting.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The duration of eribulin exposure and relative dose intensity were very similar between the three partly 
overlapping safety populations studied (AETP, BCP and Study 305). A high percentage (38-49%) of all 
three eribulin populations received ≥ 6 cycles of therapy, which suggests both effect and tolerability of 
the  drug.  The  median  duration  of  exposure  was  considerably  higher  in  the  eribulin  arm  (17  weeks) 
compared with the TPC-arm (9 weeks) of Study 305.  
In study 305, the toxicity profile of eribulin was more or less as can be expected from a tubulin-active 
chemotherapeutic agent. The most common AEs in the eribulin arm were asthenia & fatigue (53.7%), 
neutropenia (51.7%), alopecia (44.5%), nausea (34.6%), peripheral neuropathy (34.6%), constipation 
(24.7%) and leucopenia (23.1%). No important differences between the eribulin and the TCP arm were 
observed.  
The two pooled safety populations, the All eribulin treated population (AETP, n= 1222) and the Breast 
cancer  population  (BCP,  n=  827),  had  very  similar  frequencies  of  AEs,  although  often  slightly  higher 
than  Study  305.  In  the  AETP  and  BCP  asthenia/fatigue  occurred  in  60%,  neutropenia  in  53-55%, 
nausea  in  39-40%,  and  peripheral  neuropathy  in  around  34  %.  The  dominating  SAE  was  febrile 
neutropenia occurring in 4%. Thromboembolic SAEs (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis) 
occurred in a frequency of ≤ 2%, which is around what may be expected in this disease and therapy 
setting (Stein et al, Am J Med, 2006). The pattern of AEs and SAEs is consistent with that of a tubulin-
acting cytotoxic agent. 
Myelosuppression was primarily manifested as neutropenia which was dose-dependent, reversible and 
not  cumulative;  the  mean  time  to  nadir  was  13  days  and  the  mean  time  to  recovery  from  severe 
neutropenia (< 0.5 x109/l) was 8 days. Neutrophil counts of < 0.5 x109/l that lasted for more than 7 
days occurred in 13% of breast cancer patients treated with eribulin. Febrile neutropenia occurred in < 
5% of breast cancer patients treated with eribulin. 
Severe neutropenia may be managed by the use of G-CSF or equivalent at the physician’s discretion in 
accordance  with  relevant  guidelines.  18%  of  breast  cancer  patients  treated  in  a  phase  3  study  with 
eribulin received G-CSF. 
Patients with ALT or AST >3 x ULN experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia. Although data are limited, patients with bilirubin >1.5 x ULN also have a higher incidence 
of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. 
Treatment with eribulin should only be initiated in patients with ANC values ≥ 1.5 x 109/L and platelets 
> 100 x 109/l. Also complete blood counts should be performed on all patients prior to each dose of

eribulin. Dose reductions and dose delays related to haematological and non-haematological adverse 
reactions have been proposed by the applicant and are considered acceptable (see section 4.2) 
In  the  827  breast  cancer  patients  35%  of  patients  experienced  peripheral  neuropathy.  The  median 
time  to  Grade  2  peripheral  neuropathy  was  85  days  (post  4  cycles).  Development  of  grade  3  or  4 
peripheral  neuropathy  occurred  in  7%  of  eribulin  treated  breast  cancer  patients.  Patients  with  pre-
existing neuropathy  were  as  likely  to  develop  new or  worsening  symptoms  as  those  who entered  the 
study  without  the  condition.  In  patients  with  pre-existing  Grade  1  or  2  peripheral  neuropathy,  the 
frequency  of  treatment-emergent  Grade  3  peripheral  neuropathy  was  10%.  Analyses  of  treatment-
related AEs in relation to cumulative doses and exposure of eribulin suggest that peripheral neuropathy 
is  a  cumulative  toxicity,  in  line  with  other  tubulin-targeting  drugs.  In  most  cases  the  neuropathy 
resolved,  in  the  sense  of  returning  to  baseline  or  lower,  during  or  after  the  treatment  period.  An 
accurate  estimation  of  the  time  to  (complete)  resolution  is  however  not  possible,  due  to  a  large 
number  of  censorings.  The  most  feared  peripheral motor  neuropathy  was  experienced  by  only  5%  of 
the patients. Adequate warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The  applicant  will  provide  data  on  frequency  of  resolution  and  time-to-resolution  of  peripheral 
neuropathy from study 209 as reflected in the RMP (see section 2.7). 
In the BCP  
The  incidence  of  treatment-related  nausea  and  vomiting  (36%  and  14%,  respectively,  in  the  BCP) 
would  motivate  antiemetic  premedication  with  one  dose  of  corticosteroids,  according  to  international 
recommendations  (Kris  et  al).  Forty-six  percent  of  patients  received  anti-emetic  prophylaxis  during 
cycle1, half of which included the steroid dexamethasone. While corticosteroid anti-emetic prophylaxis 
may not be required for all patients, it should be considered and this is mentioned in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
Of the 17 AEs with an outcome of death unrelated to disease progression that occurred in the BCP (n= 
827)  during  study  or  within  30  days  of  last  dose/visit,  only  6  were  reported  as  possibly  or  probably 
treatment-related,  3  of  which  were  infections,  which  can  be  expected  of  immunosuppressive  agents 
like  eribulin.  Thus,  in  both  the  pivotal  study  and  the  BCP  safety  population  treatment-related  deaths 
occurred in a frequency of ≤ 1 %.  
The  pattern  of  abnormal  haematological  values  appeared  mainly  due  to  the  direct  bone  marrow 
suppression and primarily affected neutrophils, in a manner typical of cytotoxic compounds. 
Eribulin  is  minimally  excreted  via  the  kidney.  Sub-group  analysis  of  the  pooled  safety  populations 
showed  trends  of  increased  toxicity  in  patients  with  serum-creatinine  clearance  levels  below  normal, 
but the groups were small. Moreover, in this setting an abnormal creatinine value is likely to be related 
to a poorer disease status overall, thus these data may not reflect an independent effect of eribulin on 
renal impairment specifically.  
In a newly reported NCI sponsored phase I study of renal impairment s (Synold et al 2010) in 21 
patients with advanced urothelial cancer, 1of 6 patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine 
clearance 20-40 mL/m, not needing dialysis) had DLT (grade 3 muscle weakness and grade 3 
hypoalbuminemia) at the recommended dose of 1.23 mg/m2. The eribulin exposure was increased in 
patients with creatinine clearance below 30-40 ml/min, which could be caused by reduced biliary 
transporter expression (see Clinical Pharmacokinetics). In order to discuss potential treatment 
recommendations for patients with different degrees of renal impairment, the applicant will submit as 
part of the risk management plan, the available rich data (the NCI study and the pooled study data) 
using renal function as a continuous variable. Patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 62/70
 
 
 
 
 
clearance <40 ml/min) may need a reduction of the dose although the optimal dose for this patient 
groups remains to be established.  In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, no specific 
dose adjustments are recommended.  
Patients with ALT or AST >3 x ULN experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia. Although data are limited, patients with bilirubin >1.5 x ULN also have a higher incidence 
of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.  
In an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, 
independent of eribulin concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1. ECG monitoring is 
recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia, 
medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmic, and 
electrolyte abnormalities.  Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to initiating 
Halaven and these electrolytes should be monitored periodically during therapy. Eribulin should be 
avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. 
As the studies that included men concern different populations than the female advanced breast cancer 
population  (which  constitutes  the  majority  of  women  exposed  to  eribulin),  the  differences  in  AEs 
between men and women may be confounded by differences unrelated to gender.  
No  specific  dose  adjustments  were  recommended  based  on  age  of  the  patient  and  none  appears 
necessary. 
The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions does not justify pre-medication. 
In one case of overdose the patient inadvertently receiving 8.6 mg of eribulin mesylate (approximately 
4 times the planned dose) subsequently developed a hypersensitivity reaction (Grade 3) on Day 3 and 
neutropenia (Grade 3) on Day 7. Both adverse reactions resolved with supportive care. 
There  is  no  known  antidote  for  eribulin  overdose. In  the  event  of  an  overdose,  the  patient  should  be 
closely monitored and the presenting clinical manifestations adequately treated.  
No  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  identified  based  on  PK  data  so  far  but  the  transport 
protein  involved  in  the  biliary  excretion  of  eribulin,  which  is  the  main  elimination  pathway,  has  not 
been identified. A trend for subjects taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors to have a higher percentage 
of serious AEs, deaths and AEs leading to treatment discontinuations was observed during the clinical 
studies.  A  possible  explanation  could  be  that  these  patients  had  concomitant  infections  (the  most 
commonly  used  CYP3A4  inhibitors  were  fluconazole  and  clarithromycin).  Another  explanation  is 
increased systemic or local exposure of eribulin through P-gp inhibition by these drugs. In Study 109 
co-administration  of  eribulin  with  ketoconazole,  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  was  studied  and 
ketoconazole had no effect on eribulin exposure. Ketoconazole is stated to be a mild to moderate P-gp 
inhibitor but clear evidence for this is presently lacking, hence extrapolation of results to known potent 
P-gp inhibitors should be made with caution. Eribulin does not inhibit the CYP enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 
2C19 and 2D6 at relevant clinical concentrations. 
There is no experience of using eribulin in combination with anti-HER2 therapy in clinical trials. 
The  AE  most  often  causing  discontinuation  of  treatment  was  peripheral  neuropathy  at  around  4%  in 
the  BCP  and  AETP.  Asthenia/fatigue  caused  discontinuation 
in  approximately  1%,  and 
neutropenia/febrile  neutropenia  in  <  1%  of  patients.  This  pattern  is  consistent  with  a  tubulin  acting 
cytotoxic agent. 
The  risk  of  asthenia  and fatigue  may  lead  to  a  minor  or  moderate  influence on  the  ability  to  drive  or 
use machines. This is reflected in section 4.7 of the SmPC 
CHMP assessment report

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety and tolerability of eribulin in latter lines of therapy for advanced disease may be 
considered sufficiently established to enable a B/R assessment. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
In advanced stages of breast cancer the most important beneficial effects are increased overall survival 
(OS)  in  combination  with  a  good  tolerability  of  the  drug,  since  this  may  impact  the  quality  of  the 
remaining time in life. Another important beneficial effect is prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), 
as time without tumour progression (and accompanying symptoms and psychological effects) are also 
of significant value for the quality of the remaining life.  
The updated OS analysis showed consistent results with the original analysis, including HR 0.805 (95% 
CI 0.67, 0.96), p-value (0.014) and an increase of median OS from 75 to 82 days (2.7 months). In the 
Investigator assessment-based analysis of PFS the HR was 0.76 (95% CI 0.64, 0.90).  
Since  eribulin  is  a  tubulin-targeting  drug,  the  issue  of  cross-resistance  between  eribulin  and  other 
tubulin-active  drugs  was  investigated.  The  positive  effect  on  OS  and  PFS  was  seen  in  both  taxane-
refractory and non-refractory groups of patients. In the OS update, the HR for eribulin versus TPC was 
0.90 (95% CI 0.71, 1.14) in favour of eribulin for taxane-refractory patients and 0.73 (95% CI 0.56, 
0.96) for patients not taxane-refractory. In the Investigator assessment-based analysis of PFS (based 
on original data cut-off), the HR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.61, 0.97) for taxane-refractory patients and 0.76 
(95% CI 0.58, 0.99) for patients not taxane-refractory. 
A second subgroup of interest was the capecitabine-naïve patients. The positive effect on OS was seen 
both in capecitabine-naïve and in capecitabine pre-treated patient groups. The analysis of updated OS 
showed  a  survival  benefit  for  the  eribulin  group  compared  to  TPC  both  in  capecitabine  pre-treated 
patients  with  a  HR  of  0.787  (95%  CI  0.645,  0.961),  and  for  the  capecitabine-naïve  patients  with  a 
corresponding  HR  of  0.865  (95%  CI  0.606,  1.233).  Investigator  assessment-based  analysis  of  PFS 
(based  on  original  data  cut-off),  also  showed  a  positive  effect  in  the  capecitabine  pre-treated  group 
with a HR of 0.68 (0.56, 0.83). For the capecitabine-naïve group the corresponding HR was 1.03 (0.73, 
1.45). 
CHMP assessment report  
 doc ref EMA/CHMP/5019/2011  
Page 66/70
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
There were no important differences in terms of clinical efficacy with regard to HR point estimates and 
CIs for any of the sub-group analyses conducted. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Eribulin is eliminated mainly by biliary excretion and the transporter involved in unknown. If the biliary 
excretion is completely inhibited, this could result in a 250% increase in systemic exposure. A general 
warning is included  in  the  SmPC  but  there  may  be  inhibitors  marketed  where  the  inhibitory  effect  on 
the transporter is unknown. Further clarifications concerning transporter inhibition, hepatic impairment 
and renal impairment will be addressed in future studies, which are part of the risk management plan.  
There  are  clearly  more  AEs  and  treatment-related  AEs  overall  associated  with  eribulin  treatment 
compared  with  TPC,  and  the  pattern  is  consistent  with  that  of  a  tubulin  acting  cytotoxic  agent.  With 
regard to the most frequent AE, asthenia/fatigue (occurring in >50% of patients), the difference was 
mainly  due  to  grade  1-2  AEs,  however.  Most  (3/4)  cases  of  the  other  tubulin-inhibiting  typical  AE, 
peripheral neuropathy (occurring in around 35% of patients), were also grade 1-2. Even so, it was the 
AE  most  frequently  causing  treatment  discontinuation,  and  the cumulative  peripheral  neuropathy  is  a 
factor  likely  to  affect  the  quality  of  life  during  an  extended  time,  possibly  for  the  remainder  of  many 
patients’ lives. The median Time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 23 weeks in both pooled safety 
populations  (AETP  and  BCP),  and  median  Time  to  grade  ≥  2  peripheral  neuropathy  was  43  and  54 
weeks,  respectively.  Time  to  resolution  of  peripheral  neuropathy  is  not  possible  to  assess  with  any 
degree  of  certainty,  due  to  a  large  proportion  of  definitely  censored  patients,  the  most  conservative 
estimation currently being 13 weeks, based on less than 20% being resolved. In the 32.5% of the BCP 
patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy events of CTC grade higher than baseline neuropathy, 
the  event  was  resolved  in  42%  of  cases,  in  the  sense  returning  to  baseline  or  lower.  Twelve  of  37 
(32%)  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  peripheral  neuropathy  resolved,  as  did  31/40 
(77.5%)  of  patients  who  had  their  dose  delayed  or  reduced  due  to  peripheral  neuropathy,  indicating 
that peripheral neuropathy to some degree can be managed.  
The  incidences  of  neutropenia  grade  3-4  and  febrile  neutropenia  were  high  (45%  and  4%, 
respectively),  despite  that  one  fifth  of  patients  received  G-CSF.  A  shift  in  absolute  neutrophil  count 
from  grade  0  to  4  in  cycle  1  was  seen  in  15.5%  of  patients.  Neutropenia  did  not  cause  treatment 
discontinuation in high frequency however, and the impact on quality of life from a hospitalization due 
to  such  an  event  is  normally  of  short  duration.  The  long-term  impact  on  bone  marrow  function  and 
resulting increased risk of neutropenia is a problem shared with many classes of cytotoxic agents.  
The incidence of nausea and vomiting is similar to that of other drugs used in this indication, as shown 
by the TPC-arm of Study 305, and may be controlled by anti-emetic premedication.  
The  incidence  of  thromboembolic  SAEs  (pulmonary  embolism  and  deep  vein  thrombosis)  is  around 
what  may  be  expected  in  this  disease  and  therapy  setting.  The  TEAEs  with  an  outcome  of  death 
unrelated to disease progression was low (<1%), and a majority of these AEs were infections, as can 
be expected of immunosuppressive agents like eribulin.  
In the BCP 12% of the patients received anti-emetics as treatment for adverse reactions during cycle 1, 
and  46%  received  anti-emetic  prophylaxis,  which  in  1/2  of  the  cases  included  the  corticosteroid 
dexamethasone.  The  incidence  of  nausea/vomiting  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  did  not  use 
antiemetic during cycle 1 (42% of all patients) is consistently lower compared with the subgroups who 
used  anti-emetics,  most  likely  reflecting  an  enrichment  in  the  anti-emetic  treated  groups  of  patients 
with current or previous nausea/vomiting reactions and consequent increased risk of these AEs. Thus,

the treating physicians appear to have successfully identified a patient population at risk of nausea and 
vomiting, and the “natural” incidence of these adverse events is likely to have been even higher if left 
without anti-emetic prophylaxis. It does appear, however, that the prescribers can handle this situation 
wisely.  The  frequencies  reported  in  the  BCP  of  36%  treatment-related  nausea,  and  14%  treatment-
related vomiting would motivate antiemetic premedication with one dose of corticosteroids, according 
to international recommendations. While corticosteroid anti-emetic prophylaxis may not be required for 
all patients, it should be considered.  
There  is  a  difference  in  the  frequency  of  psychiatric  disorders,  12  %  in  the  TPC  arm  vs.  19%  in  the 
eribulin  arm,  and  22%  in  the  pooled eribulin  populations.  The difference  appears  mainly  to  be  driven 
by  the  preferred  terms  depression  at  5  vs.  1%  (additionally  supported  by  depressed  mood,  mood 
altered,  and  mood  swings)  and  insomnia  at  8  vs.  4%.  Some  explanations  for  these  differences  have 
been given by the Applicant, including corresponding differences in the patients’ histories of psychiatric 
disorders  (17%  vs.  14%,  in  the  eribulin  and  TPC  arms,  respectively),  and  in  baseline  symptoms  of 
depression  (7.7%  vs.  4.7%)  and  insomnia  (8.9%  vs.  6.7%).  The  overall  frequency  of  baseline 
psychiatric disorders was 38.6% in the BCP population, and in Study 305 it was 33.0% in the eribulin 
arm and 28.3% in the TPC arm. The Applicant has also shown that the risk of experiencing psychiatric 
AEs is higher in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The pharmacokinetics of eribulin is presently not fully characterised. The main pathway of elimination 
is  biliary  excretion  and  at  present  there  is  no  information  on  which  transporter(s)  is  involved  in  the 
process  making  predictions  of  drug-interactions  resulting  in  increased  eribulin  exposure  impossible  to 
perform.  If  the  biliary  secretion  is  completely inhibited,  the  exposure  (AUC)  could  increase  by  250%. 
CYP3A4  is  an  important  drug  metabolising  enzyme.  In  vitro  data  indicate  that  eribulin  may  inhibit 
CYP3A4 in the liver. No in vivo data is available. If eribulin inhibits the enzyme significantly in vivo, this 
may lead to interactions with a number of drugs. The potential for drug-drug interactions is adequately 
reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Drug-drug  interaction  studies  are  being  conducted  (see  2.7  Risk  Management 
Plan) 
The potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias has not been adequately evaluated. Inhibition of IKr (hERG) 
in  vitro  was  evaluated  at  a  single  concentration  (30  µM).  Therefore  it  is  not  possible  to  calculate  an 
EC50  value  for  the  estimation  of  safety  margins. No  QT  prolongation  was seen  in  conscious  dogs  but 
the  highest  tested  dose  (0.04  mg/kg)  resulted  in  an  exposure  that  was  lower  than  the  clinical. 
Furthermore, the dogs were given eribulin as a 60 min infusion, which probably made the difference in 
Cmax, i.e. the most relevant parameter to compare, larger still. 
ECGs  and  QTc  intervals  were  evaluated  in  the  clinical  Study  110.  There  were  no  signs  of  QT 
prolongation associated with the administration of eribulin, but as eribulin is a cytotoxic drug the study 
was  not  optimal  to  exclude  such  effects.  Adequate  information  on  QT  prolongation  is  reflected  in  the 
SmPC (see section 4.4) 
Time to resolution of peripheral neuropathy is not possible to assess with any degree of certainty, due 
to  the  high  degree  of  censoring,  >  80%  of  affected  patients,  only  a  few  of  whom  still  remained  on 
therapy with ongoing neuropathy. While some information is available in the majority of patients who 
experienced  peripheral  neuropathy  events  of  CTC  grade  higher  than  baseline  (see  previous  section), 
the average Time to resolution and the proportion of the patients in whom the AE can be expected to 
resolve after discontinuation will not be known based on the present studies. There are however other 
ongoing  studies  that  might  shed  more  light  on  this  issue,  i.e.  the  randomised  phase  3  Study  301 
CHMP assessment report

(E7389-G000-301),  and  the  phase  2  Study  209  (E7389-G000-209),  designed  to  specifically  address 
the neuropathy safety issue (see section 7.7, Risk Management Plan). 
Benefit-risk balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Considering  that  the  comparator  is  chosen  to  be  the  most  active  and  suitable  for  each  individual 
patient,  based  on  tumour  characteristics  and  medical  history,  the  magnitude  of  the  OS  results  are 
considered  clinically  meaningful.  Prolonged  PFS  is  also  of  significant  value  to  patients  with  incurable 
cancer and supports the survival findings.  
Overall,  the  known  toxicity  and  tolerability  profile  of  eribulin  is  considered  reasonably  well 
characterised and in essence typical for cytotoxic drugs with this mechanism of action.  
  Benefit-risk balance 
In  patients  with  advanced  breast  cancer,  the  benefits  from  eribulin in form of  prolonged  survival  and 
progression-free survival are considered clinically relevant.  
The  incidence  of  neutropenia/febrile  neutropenia  was  high  and  associated  with  cases  of  deaths. 
However, these are not considered to outweigh the benefits of treatment in terms of overall survival.  
The  nausea  and  vomiting  reactions  are  seen  with many  cytotoxic  compounds,  and  normally  accepted 
when balanced against the beneficial effects. The frequencies in the present populations would suggest 
the  use  of  corticosteroid  anti-emetics  according  to  internationally  accepted  guidelines.  While 
corticosteroid anti-emetic prophylaxis may not be required for all patients, it should be considered.  
Concerning peripheral neuropathy, this is an inherent problem with tubulin-targeting drugs, which can 
be acceptable in light of the benefits. The frequencies were not higher than for some other approved 
drugs, and the majority 3/4 of the events were grade 1-2. Robust data regarding Time-to-resolution of 
peripheral  neuropathy  will  not  be  generated  by  the  present  studies,  but  other  studies  are  ongoing, 
including one that specifically addresses this issue as primary objective (see section 2.7). 
Remaining  uncertainties  concerning  cardiac  safety  are  part  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  as  an 
identified risk and addressed in PSURs. 
In conclusion, the balance of benefits and risks is considered positive. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In  late-stage  cancer  the  main  safety  issue  is  tolerability,  while  low-frequency  SAEs  are  of  less 
importance.  The  tolerability  of  eribulin  is  lower  than  that  of  some  other  agents  used  in  latter  lines  of 
the disease, but this is accompanied by a relevantly improved chance of prolonged survival, which can 
be  assumed  to  outweigh  the  tolerability-problems  in  the  eyes  of  many  patients  and  their  prescribing 
doctors.  Some  of  the  identified  and  uncertain  risks  can  be  managed  through  the  SmPC;  further 
clarifications regarding the risks can be provided with further studies included in the RMP (see section 
2.7).  
2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were

needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. No additional risk minimisation activities 
were required beyond those included in the product information.  
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Halaven monotherapy  
in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  progressed 
after at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease. Prior therapy should have included 
an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

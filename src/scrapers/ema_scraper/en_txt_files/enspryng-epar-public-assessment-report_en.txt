(Appendix 1) 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NMO/NMOSD  are  severe  autoimmune  inflammatory  demyelinating  disorders  that  are  typically 
characterized by optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (Wingerchuk et al. 2015). 
The applicant seeks approval for satralizumab (Enspryng) in the following indication: as a monotherapy 
or  in  combination  with  immunosuppressive  therapy  (IST)  for  the  treatment  of  adult  and  adolescent 
patients from 12 years of age with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD).  
The recommended loading dose  is 120 mg  subcutaneous (SC) injection every two weeks for the  first 
three  administrations  (first  dose  at  week  0,  second  dose  at  week  2  and  third  dose  at  week  4).  The 
recommended maintenance dose is 120 mg SC injection every four weeks.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 10/132 
 
 
  
  
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Epidemiological studies of the uncommon disorder neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) may 
be difficult to interpret because of the evolving nature of diagnostic criteria, differences in the definition 
and accuracy of NMOSD diagnosis, the completeness of case ascertainment, and variability in assays for 
the  disease‐specific  biomarker  aquaporin-4  immunoglobulin  G  antibody  (AQP4‐IgG).  A  significant 
increase in yearly incidence rate has been reported over time. In recent European epidemiological studies 
on NMO(SD), the incidence rate was found to be 0.07-0.079 per 100 000 and the prevalence 1.04-1.09 
per 100 000 (e.g. Jonsson et al. 2019; Asgari et al. 2019). 
Standard treatment is based on the use of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs and aims to control 
the severity of acute attacks and to prevent relapses of the disease (Bruscolini et al. 2018). Disability 
and mortality are associated with the severity of these acute attacks and frequency of relapses. While 
NMO(SD) prognosis has improved over the last decades, it remains a severely debilitating disease with 
a  significant  proportion  of  patients  suffering  from  neurological  sequelae  after  the  initial  period  of  the 
disease and after relapses. A female predominance is observed in many published cohorts, with a female 
to male ratio ranging from 3:1 in France to 10:1 in Japan (Jacob et al. 2013). NMO(SD) occurs at all 
ages, with a mean age of onset around the age of 40, resulting in a high level of disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs). In a recently published study from Sweden, 49% and 75% of NMO(SD) patients had a 
relapse within 5 and 10 years respectively, and 2.4% died within the follow up (mean time of 8 years) 
(Jonsson et al. 2019). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
NMOSD is an inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disease that is associated with serum AQP4‐
IgG. The major pathological mechanism of injury in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD involves the AQP4-
IgG  binding  to  aquaporin-4  water  channels  in  the  astrocytes  of  brain,  spinal  cord,  and  optic  nerve, 
followed  by  inflammation,  disruption  of  blood–brain  barrier,  and  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity 
(CDC),  with  ensuing  demyelination  and  axonal  damage,  and  ultimately  neurological  symptoms 
characteristic  of  NMOSD.  Thus,  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  NMOSD  could  be  viewed  as  an  autoimmune 
astrocytopathy.  
In 20–30% of patients, depending  on  the  assay used,  AQP4-IgG  are  not  detectable  (Melamed et al., 
2015).  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  NMOSD  includes  patients  with  a  myelin  oligodendrocyte  glycoprotein 
(MOG)-antibody-seropositive  disease  and  patients  who  are  negative  for  both  antibodies  (double 
seronegative)  (Fujihara  et  al.  2019).  Whether  AQP4-Ab  positive  and  AQP4-Ab  negative  diseases  are 
varieties of the same entity is a topic of ongoing research (Jarius et al., 2012, Jiao et al., 2013, Kiyat-
Atamer et al., 2013). 
A  plasmablast  B  cell  subset  has  been  identified  (Chihara  et  al.,  2011),  associated  with  production  of 
AQP4-IgG and shown to be selectively increased in the blood of NMOSD patients. The survival of this 
plasmablast  subpopulation  is  promoted  by  interleukin  6  (IL-6),  which  was  shown  to  enhance  their 
antibody production, whereas anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade selectively inhibited survival of AQP4-
IgG producing plasmablasts. Consequently, this IL-6-dependent B-cell subpopulation may be assumed 
to play an important role in the pathophysiology of NMOSD.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
NMOSD  is  typified  by  recurrent  attacks  of  severe  optic  neuritis  and/or  myelitis,  often  in  form  of  an 
extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). In AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD, the reported frequency of optic 
neuritis is 37-54% and of LETM 30–47% (Jarius et al., 2012, Aboul-Enein et al, 2013, Zhang Bao et al, 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 11/132 
 
 
  
  
2017).  Also,  other  symptoms  or  syndromes  occur,  for  instance  brainstem  and  brain  involvement. 
Persistent  hiccup,  nausea  or  vomiting  (area  postrema  syndrome),  narcolepsy,  acute  diencephalic 
syndrome or muscle affection are possible (Chen et al, 2017, Bab et al., 2009). The ensuing disability 
accumulates predominantly through relapses of the disease as recovery of the neurologic deficits is often 
incomplete.  The  most  common  and  burdensome  clinical  symptoms  are  pain,  especially  neuropathic, 
fatigue, headache, depression, and sleep disorders (Kleiter et al., 2016, Mizuno et al, 2018, Asseyer et 
al, 2018, Song et al, 2015; Penner et al, 2017). Prognosis of the disease is worse and mortality rate 
higher without long-term IST (Mealy et al, 2018). Disease may appear at any age (given range 4-88 
years), but the incidence is most common in early middle age (mean age of onset 39 years) (Pandit et 
al. 2015, Krumbholz et al., 2015). Female sex predominates, especially in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD 
patients, female to male-ratios as high as 10:1 have been reported (Pandit et al, 2015; Borisow et al., 
2017,  Wingerchuk  2009).  It  is  notable  that  comorbidity  with  other  autoimmune  disorders  is  fairly 
common. 
A central component of diagnostics is the detection of antibodies in serum. Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) is an essential part of diagnostics, helping to differentiate NMO/NMOSD from other CNS disorders. 
Clinical criteria have been revised in 2015, and they distinguish between NMOSD  with AQP4-IgG and 
NMOSD  without  AQP4-IgG  or  with  unknown  antibody  status.  The  core  clinical  symptoms  are  1)  optic 
neuritis, 2) acute myelitis, 3) area postrema syndrome, 4) acute brainstem syndrome, 5) symptomatic 
narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with typical MRI, 6) symptomatic cerebral syndrome 
with typical brain lesions.  In case of AQP4-IgG seropositivity, one core symptom is needed, but without 
this evidence, two core features are necessary, at least one being optic neuritis, LETM, or area postrema 
syndrome (Wingerchuk et al, 2015). 
The prognosis is affected by the stepwise deterioration due to relapses which usually worsen over days 
to  a  nadir  and  recover over  several  weeks  to  months  with  sequelae.  Predictors  of  a  worse  prognosis 
include the number of relapses during the first two years, the severity of the first attack, older age, and 
probably association with other autoimmune disorders. The high mortality rates are frequently caused 
by neurogenic respiratory failure occurring with brainstem or extended cervical lesions (Sellner et al., 
2010). Reported mortality rate ranges (25-50%) may be biased towards the severe end. 
2.1.5.  Management 
NMOSD  attacks  are  treated  with  high-dose  intravenous  corticosteroids  and  apheresis  therapies,  in 
particular therapeutic plasma exchange. In cases of incomplete remission, escalation of attack treatment 
is recommended.  
Preventive  therapy  is  IST  and  should  be  commenced  as  early  as  possible.  Apart  from  classical 
immunosuppressants  such  as  azathioprine  and  mycophenolate  mofetil,  repurposed  biologicals, 
particularly  B-depleting  agents  (e.g.  rituximab)  are  widely  used.  The  preventive  therapy  has  been 
regarded as beneficial, and the scarce published data provide an indication of a preventive effect to an 
extent; consensus treatment regimens have been published and are widely used throughout the world 
with  an  apparent  clinical  benefit.  Nevertheless,  an  adequate  evidence  base  of  randomized  controlled 
trials has been lacking to support these currently used treatment options. Thus, an unmet medical need 
has long been prevalent. In 2019, Eculizumab was authorised for  the treatment of NMOSD AQP4-IgG 
seropositive adult patients with a relapsing course of the disease.  
About the product 
A treatment that blocks IL-6 signalling may inhibit key NMOSD pathophysiological processes and lead to 
reduction  of  relapses.  Satralizumab  (SA237)  is  a humanized IgG2  anti  IL-6R  monoclonal  antibody.  It 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 12/132 
 
 
  
  
specifically targets the human IL-6R, blocks IL-6 from binding to membrane-bound and soluble IL-6R, 
and thereby inhibits IL-6 downstream signalling.  
The claimed indication was the following: 
As a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the treatment of 
adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders 
(NMOSD) (see section 5.1). 
The approved indication is the following:  
As a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the treatment of 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients from 12 years 
of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) seropositive (see section 5.1). 
At a body weight of at least 40 kg, the recommended loading dose is 120 mg subcutaneous (SC) 
injection every two weeks for the first three administrations (first dose at week 0, second dose 
at week 2 and third dose at week 4). 
The recommended maintenance dose is 120 mg SC injection every four weeks. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the Applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on  the lack of evidence-based treatment options 
for  NMO/NMOSD  at  the  time  of  the  request  and  the  Applicant’s  presentation  of  the  pivotal  studies, 
indicating that satralizumab may constitute an efficacious treatment option for the prevention of relapses 
in patients with NMO/NMOSD in adults and adolescents, potentially with an acceptable safety profile. At 
the time of the Applicant’s request, CHMP considered that the overall design of these studies and scope 
of the data may be sufficient to address the unmet medical need in patients with NMO(SD). 
However, the CHMP concluded during assessment that it was no longer appropriate to pursue accelerated 
assessment. During the evaluation of this MAA, a new product was approved for market authorisation in 
the Treatment of adult patients with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)  who are anti-
aquaporin-4  (AQP4)  antibody  (Ab)  positive.  At  the  time  of  the  Applicant’s  request  for  accelerated 
procedure, there was a lack of approved treatments and a high unmet medical need. The initially sought 
indication; monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the treatment of 
adult  and  adolescent  patients  from  12  years  of  age  with  neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorders 
(NMOSD) included patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody (Ab) negative and adolescents, 
patient groups which are not covered by the approved product. However, the Applicant was unable to 
demonstrate efficacy in the AQP4-IgG seronegative NMOSD patients and proposed a revised indication 
excluding  these  patients.  At  that  moment,  there  were  major  objections  to  the  efficacy  and  safety 
regarding other subgroups including the one of age span 12-17 years.  
As outlined in previous central advice procedures (EMEA/H/SA/2571/2/FU/2/2018/PA/II), prior concerns 
regarding the breached blinding of the studies (related to satralizumab’s lowering effect on fibrinogen) 
were  present,  and  this  was  also  raised  in  the  accelerated  procedure  assessment  (Enspryng-478AA-
Briefing  Note).  Following  further  assessment,  major  objections  were  raised  regarding  these  GCP 
violations and possibly correlated protocol  amendments for study BN40900, resulting in loss of study 
integrity and control of type 1 error, overall questioning the robustness of the results and trial integrity 
of this pivotal study. A routine inspection of the sponsor and  of  one investigator site  was  performed, 
prompting the need for triggered inspection. At that moment, the final inspection report from the routine 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 13/132 
 
 
  
  
inspection was pending and the full impact of these and other critical issues raised in the preliminary 
report, could not be fully evaluated. 
In light of above arguments questioning the strength of evidence to support fulfilment of unmet medical 
need, the CHMP agreed on 10 December 2019 that the accelerated process is to be reverted to standard 
timetable (Guideline on the procedure for accelerated assessment, EMEA/274268/2006).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Satralizumab, the active substance contained in Enspryng, is a recombinant humanised IgG2 monoclonal 
antibody  that  binds  to  soluble  and  membrane-bound  IL-6R  and  thereby  prevents  IL-6  downstream 
signalling through these receptors.  
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  a  1  mL  solution  for  subcutaneous  injection  in  a  single-use  PFS 
containing 120 mg of satralizumab formulated with commonly used compendial excipients: L-histidine, 
L-aspartic acid, L-arginine, poloxamer 188 and water for injections. The PFS is presented assembled with 
an automatic needle guard.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Satralizumab is a recombinant humanised IgG2 monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO)  cells.  Satralizumab  was  designed  by  amino  acid  substitutions  to  improve  some  functional 
properties  such  as  reduction  of  effector  functions,  pH-dependent  binding  to  its  antigen  (IL-6R)  and 
binding to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  
Satralizumab consists of two heavy chains (443 amino acid residues each), and two light chains (214 
amino acid residues each). The calculated molecular mass is approximately 143.4 kDa (peptide chains 
only). 
The  heavy  chain  has  a  single  conserved  glycosylation  site  at  Asn295  in  the  Fc  domain.  The  N-linked 
glycans of satralizumab are typical of those observed on other CHO-produced monoclonal antibodies. C-
terminal processing cannot occur in satralizumab because the heavy chains of satralizumab lack the Gly-
Lys sequence at the C-terminus.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Satralizumab active substance is manufactured at Chugai Pharma Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (CPMC), 5-1, 
Ukima  5-Chome,  Kita-ku,  Tokyo,  115-8543,  Japan.  The  name,  address,  and  responsibilities  of  each 
manufacturer involved in the manufacture, storage, and testing of the  active substance is available in 
the dossier. The EU Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance status was confirmed. No concerns 
are raised. 
A  batch  of  active  substance  is  defined  as  the  material  purified  from  one  production  bioreactor.  One 
working cell bank (WCB) vial can be used for several cultivation batches during a cultivation campaign. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 14/132 
 
 
  
  
This  approach  is  acceptable.  All  media  used  for  the  cell  culture  process  are  free  of  animal-derived 
substances. Recombinant human insulin is used in non-selective cultivation media. 
The commercial manufacturing process of satralizumab active substance encompasses cell culture (fed-
batch), harvest and primary capture, purification, concentration, formulation, conditioning and filtration 
to final fill. The purification encompasses four chromatography  steps, low-pH virus inactivation, virus 
filtration  and  ultra-/diafiltration  (UF/DF).  The  manufacturing  process  and  process  controls  are 
summarised in flow charts and tables. The purpose of each step is clearly stated and a brief description 
is provided. Process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) are listed, including criticality assignment, 
and criteria for collection of fractions are provided. Critical steps, critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
IPCs  are  presented  in  a  condensed  format.  The  impact  of  each  process  parameter  to  critical  quality 
attributes (CQAs) is clearly described. Management of deviations to these limits is acceptably described. 
Operating  sequences,  resin  and  filter  materials,  buffers,  reuses  (where  applicable),  and  collection  of 
fractions are provided for the chromatography steps and the filtration steps. Pre-harvest samples are 
tested for adventitious agents. The level of detail is considered sufficient. 
For  some  steps,  there  are  clearly  indicated  restriction  relationships  where  certain  process  parameter 
setpoint combinations are not allowed.  
In practice, the variation of one or more process parameter set points within the acceptable ranges is 
allowed. Process parameter changes within the acceptable ranges will be managed per the Applicant’s 
Quality  System.  The  definition  used  by  the  Applicant  is  similar  to  the  definition  of  proven  acceptable 
ranges as provided by ICH Q8. No design space is claimed. 
IPCs are supported by the attribute criticality assessment. In-process pool hold times and hold conditions 
are appropriately described for each step.  
Reprocessing  is  allowed  for  certain  manufacturing  steps.  Protocols  for  concurrent  validation  at  the 
manufacturing scale are provided. The overall approach for reprocessing is appropriate. 
In summary, it can be concluded that the description of the proposed manufacturing process and process 
controls are acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials 
Detailed  descriptions  of  raw  materials  and  consumables  such  as  resins  and  filters  are  presented. 
Specifications  are  provided  for  non-compendial  raw  materials.  The  information  provided  is  sufficient. 
Raw materials of animal origin are discussed and assessed in the section for adventitious agents. 
Source, history, and generation of the cell substrate  
The information regarding the host cell and the vector is sufficient. The source, history and generation 
of the production cell line is described and information on the plasmid sequence and cloning is provided. 
Genetic stability throughout the cell culture production process is demonstrated. Information on storage 
and stability testing of cell banks is provided. 
Cell banking system, characterisation and testing 
A safety assessment of the materials of animal origin that were used for the cell bank development and 
preparation has been provided with supplier information/certificates. The procedures for MCB and WCB 
preparation are described. The MCB and WCB were produced and tested according to ICH Q5A, Q5B and 
Q5D guidelines. Safety testing from parent seed stock to post-production cells (PPC) is described with 
viral and non-viral adventitious agents and screening for retroviruses.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 15/132 
 
 
  
  
The  overall  approach  and  result  of  the  cell  bank  testing  and  the  claimed  limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age  is 
acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The  satralizumab  CPPs  are  a  subset  of  process  parameters  that  have  been  determined  to  impact  or 
potentially impact CQAs of the active substance.  
CQAs were determined using a risk ranking and filtering (RRF) tool that assesses the possible impact of 
each quality attribute on bioactivity, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity risk, and safety.  
Process parameter criticality is based on an assessment of process validation data for the impact of each 
process parameter on the CQAs. A process parameter is critical if it has a practically significant impact 
on a CQA across the characterised range for that parameter.  
Process validation 
An  extensive  set  of  studies  for  process  evaluation  and  process  verification  is  presented,  along  with 
descriptions of methods and tools. The described process evaluation encompasses an enhanced approach 
with several elements of Quality by Design (QbD) (risk assessments, multivariate design of experiments 
(DoEs), statistical tools). Process parameter criticality evaluation is based on small-scale experiments 
and prior knowledge. In summary, a solid process understanding is demonstrated.  
Experimental design and statistical tools are sufficiently described. The definitions of CPPs and CQAs are 
aligned with ICH Q8(R2). Key performance indicators are also used to evaluate process performance. 
Overall,  the  set  of  CPPs  defined  for  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  is  as  expected  and 
considered acceptable. Predictions based on the DoE studies are used for risk assessment before changes 
and to justify the active substance specifications.   
Process  verification  of  the  manufacturing  steps  (at  manufacturing  scale)  for  active  substance  is 
adequately described and reported. The process verification activity is based on an enhanced approach 
for  process  development and  process  characterisation  but  executed  at  setpoint  within  the  acceptable 
ranges  proposed  in  the  process  description.  Process  verification  data  support  the  conclusion  that  the 
manufacturing process for active substance can be considered validated. 
In-process  hold  times  are  considered  validated.  Small-scale  data  support  the  proposed  reuse  of 
chromatography resins and UF/DF membranes. The approach to demonstrate clearance of raw materials 
is  endorsed.  Information  provided  regarding  leachables  and  extractables  (studies  performed  in 
accordance with ICH M7 and ICH Q3C) is considered sufficient. 
The information provided regarding shipping validation is sufficient.  
Manufacturing process development 
Based on clinical experience and product characterisation, CQAs were identified and acceptable levels 
were defined to ensure safety and efficacy of the product. CPPs were identified and acceptable ranges 
were defined to ensure the process produces acceptable product quality. 
A clear and structured description is given regarding the QbD elements included in the approach utilised 
for development of the satralizumab manufacture and control. The same approach has been used by the 
Applicant  for  other,  already  approved,  products.  However,  a  separate  assessment  was  made  for  this 
application. No concerns are raised on the overall approach.  
The manufacturing history and comparability exercises are described in sufficient detail. Comparability 
is demonstrated for the versions used throughout development. 
Characterisation 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 16/132 
 
 
  
  
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
A  comprehensive  physicochemical  and  biological  characterisation  of  satralizumab  is  presented.  It  is 
agreed  that  the  results  show  that  satralizumab  has  the  covalent  structure,  post-translational 
modifications and other characteristics of a typical humanised monoclonal antibody derived from CHO 
cells.  Studies  of  primary,  secondary  and  higher  order  structures,  various  physicochemical  properties, 
carbohydrate structure, heterogeneity pattern, biological functions, degradation pathways, and product 
variants were included. 
An extensive panel of state-of-the-art and orthogonal tests were applied. Characterisation methods and 
preparations of variants for characterisation studies are sufficiently described. All peaks are characterised 
and defined and relevant chromatograms are provided. 
Satralizumab contains N-linked glycosylation at position Asn295 of each heavy chain. Satralizumab is an 
engineered IgG2 monoclonal antibody.  
Impurities 
Product-related substances and product-related impurities are all considered “product-related variants”. 
These  variants  are  assessed  by  a  risk-based  approach  for  impact  to  bioactivity,  pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity and safety to identify the CQAs. The approach is considered scientifically sound and the 
list of identified CQAs is acceptable.  
Product-related  variants  and  process-related  impurity  CQAs  were  identified  using  a  RRF  tool  that 
evaluates  the  impact  of  each  product  quality  attribute  on  patient  safety  and  product  efficacy.  The 
definition of a CQA is in line with ICH Q8.  
The submitted information is acceptable and demonstrates a solid product understanding. 
Specification 
The  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  for  the  active  substance  were  provided.  The  test  panel  is 
acceptable  and  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  ICH  Q6B.  The  test  panel  includes  control  of  identity, 
purity and impurities, potency and other general tests. The proposed limits are acceptable. 
The proposed specifications for active substance and finished product were developed as part of a quality 
attribute-based control strategy, using the concepts of ICH guidelines.  Prior knowledge was also used 
and acceptably justified (throughout the sections). The approach used for setting the specifications is 
considered appropriate.  
Analytical procedures  
Pharmacopoeia-based and satralizumab-specific analytical procedures are used to test the commercial 
batches  of  the  active  substance  for  release  and/or  stability.  The  development  history  of  analytical 
procedures was provided. 
Appropriate validation of non-compendial methods was performed confirming suitability for their 
intended use.  
Batch analysis  
Batch genealogies and batch release results for active substance lots are provided. 
Each batch was tested to the specification in place at the time of manufacture, and the PPQ batches were 
also tested to the proposed commercial specification. All limits were met. The release data provided from 
the commercial process support a consistent manufacture of active substance. No concerns are raised. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 17/132 
 
 
  
  
Reference standards 
The same reference material is used for active substance and finished product testing. Reference is 
made to the finished product section. 
Container closure 
The active substance container closure consists of a single-use bag. 
The  approach  described  for  assessment  of  extractables  and  leachables  from  the  active  substance 
container closure system is found adequate. The Applicant concludes that the single-use bags are safe 
and suitable for storage of the active substance ≤ -50 °C. This conclusion is supported. 
In conclusion, the container closure system is considered sufficiently described. 
Stability 
The description of the stability studies, stability data and post-approval stability protocol are appropriate, 
in compliance with ICH Q1A(R2) and Q5C, and the chosen analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The container closure material is representative of the active substance container closure, except for the 
volume.  
The Applicant proposed a commercial shelf life for satralizumab active substance of 42 months at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -50°C. The proposed shelf life of 42 months at -50°C is 
considered approvable.  
It is acknowledged that one  batch per year will be placed into the stability program. The Applicant is 
reminded  that  the  stability  protocol  may  need  to  be  revised  for  post-approval  process  changes, 
depending on the nature of the change. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development   
Description of the finished product 
The proposed presentation is a 1 mL single-use PFS containing 120 mg satralizumab formulated with 
histidine (buffer), aspartic acid (pH-adjusting agent, pH 6.0), arginine (tonicity agent), poloxamer 188 
(surfactant)  and  water  for  injections  (solvent)  (Table  1).  These  excipients  are  commonly  used  for 
formulating monoclonal antibodies. The formulation does not contain a preservative. 
The solution is colourless to slightly yellow  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 18/132 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Table1: Composition of satralizumab finished product 
The primary packaging components consist of a 1 mL colourless Ph. Eur. compliant polymer syringe with 
a staked-in, stainless steel needle, fitted with a chlorinated butyl rubber-polypropylene rigid needle shield 
and sealed with a chlorinated butyl rubber plunger stopper. The PFS is labelled and assembled with an 
automatic  needle  safety  guard,  plunger  rod,  and  extended  finger  flanges.  The  secondary  packaging 
consists of a folding box made of fully coated folding boxboard. A pack size of 1 PFS is proposed. 
Compliance with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 (Polyolefins) has been confirmed for the polymer syringe and sufficient 
information  has  been  provided.  Information  in  relation  to  sterilisation  of  the  syringe  components  is 
included in the dossier. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation development 
An  acceptable  overview  of  the  formulation  development  is  provided,  including  satisfactory  data 
supporting the proposed composition of the commercial finished product. The rationale used to select 
the final composition/formulation has been described in the dossier. A formulation robustness DoE study 
was performed identifying the solution pH to significantly impact the Sum of HMW Forms, Acidic Region 
1, and Basic Region 2. Based on these results the pH acceptance criterion was tightened to 5.8-6.2 to 
improve control of stability of the commercial formulation. 
A low number of translucent to white visible particles (VP) has been observed during stability studies. 
Extended characterisation studies were performed to identify the observed particles. The results show 
that the particles are composed of protein and/or silicone oil and do not dissolve at room temperature, 
i.e. the particle formation is irreversible. VPs  are  routinely  controlled at release  and shelf life.  This is 
acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development 
Several manufacturing processes have been used for finished product. Comparability between finished 
product from the different processes has been confirmed. Long-term stability studies demonstrated the 
presence  of  VPs  during  storage  of  finished  product  manufactured  from  the  commercial  process  (see 
above). 
Container closure 
The development of the primary container closure system is sufficiently described. The barrel of the PFS 
is  made  from  a  polymer  (see  above).  The  safety  of  the  materials  of  construction  was  established. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 19/132 
 
 
  
  
 
Compatibility  between  the  finished  product  and  the  components  of  the  PFS  has  been  demonstrated 
through stability, leachables and temperature excursion studies, and is found appropriate. 
The  assembled  PFS  complies  with  the  essential  requirements  of  the  Medical  Device  Directive.  Design 
verification was performed as per relevant ISO standards. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany is responsible for batch release testing for EU.  
The manufacturing process description involves six unit operations: thawing of active substance, pooling 
and  mixing,  bioburden  reduction  filtration,  in-line  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling  and  stoppering,  and 
100% visual inspection.  
The  PFS  assembly  involves  labelling  and  assembly,  secondary  packaging  and  final  packaging.   
Reprocessing (refiltration) has been described. Refiltration may be permitted when the finished product 
solution is at risk, e.g. due to technical issues. This is found acceptable.  
Limits  for  process  parameters  and  process  controls  have  been  presented.  The  bioburden  limit  before 
sterile filtration is defined as ≤10 CFU/100 mL in line with guideline requirements. Hold times have been 
defined and are supported by the process validation data. 
The information provided in the dossier on the manufacturing process and controls is sufficiently detailed. 
Process validation 
Process validation studies comprise process verification, process design studies, microbial control and 
media  fills,  environmental  monitoring,  assembly  process  and  shipping  qualification.  Results  from  the 
process  design  studies  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  parameters 
proposed for the commercial process deliver acceptable product quality. 
Filter validation was performed, and data has been included in accordance with guideline requirements.  
The defined hold times prior to sterile filtration were demonstrated to be acceptable from a microbial 
perspective. 
Shipping conditions for the finished product are considered qualified. 
In conclusion, process validation is considered satisfactory. 
Product specification 
The  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  for  the  finished  product  includes  control  identity,  purity  and 
impurities, potency and other general tests. The test panel is acceptable and in line with the requirements 
of ICH Q6B. The proposed limits are acceptable. 
The  proposed  acceptance  criteria  for  the  finished  product  specific  parameters  sub-visible  particles, 
extractable volume, sterility, container closure integrity, break loose force and average injection force 
are found approvable. 
A risk evaluation regarding the potential presence of elemental impurities in the active substance and 
finished product was conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D. It can be concluded that the risk and the 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 20/132 
 
 
  
  
impact  on  patient  safety  associated  with  the  presence  of  elemental  impurities  is  negligible.  Specific 
control on elemental impurities are considered not needed. This is agreed. 
A risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of nitrosamines in the finished product was provided. 
The risk evaluation found that there is no risk for the presence and/or introduction of nitrosamines and/or 
their formation during the active substance manufacturing, in raw materials, in excipients, during the 
finished product manufacturing process, or in the packaging materials. This is acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
The following tests are performed in accordance with Ph. Eur.: extractable volume, visible and sub-visible 
particles,  sterility,  colour,  clarity/opalescence,  pH,  osmolality  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  The  non-
compendial analytical procedures are described with a sufficient level of detail.  
The non-compendial procedures as well as procedures specific to the control of finished product have 
been appropriately validated. The validations were performed in accordance with the requirements in 
ICH Q2(R1). Compendial procedures have been appropriately verified for their intended use. 
Batch analysis 
Batch  analyses  data  has  been  provided.  All  data  complies  with  the  proposed  finished  product 
specifications.  In  conclusion,  the  batch  analyses  data  demonstrates  acceptable  batch-to-batch 
consistency and reproducibility of the manufacturing process proposed for satralizumab finished product. 
Reference standards 
A two-tiered reference  standard  system, consisting  of a primary and a secondary  reference  material, 
both derived from the same active substance batch, was established for commercial use. This batch was 
produced using the manufacturing and formulation representative of the commercial process  
The primary reference material will be used to qualify subsequent reference materials. The secondary 
reference material is used as working standard for testing the active substance and finished product in 
all assays requiring a reference material. 
Sufficient information was provided for the reference standard, including preparation and qualification of 
future reference materials according to defined protocols. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life is 2 years at 2°C-8°C, protected from light.  
The stability studies are performed in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Data  from  an  excursion/patient  convenience  study  demonstrate  that  temperature  excursions  do  not 
impact the stability of the finished product when put back into the refrigerator and stored for up to 24 
months. The possibility of storage out of the refrigerator (below 30°C) for a single period of 8 days has 
been added to the dossier, including also the statement that the product must be either used or discarded 
after such storage. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) was revised accordingly. 
The briefly described results from photostability studies indicate that the finished product is sensitive to 
light. However, the secondary packaging provides sufficient light protection. An appropriate warning has 
been included in the product information. 
Long-term stability data demonstrate that satralizumab finished product is stable at long-term storage 
conditions and the claimed self-life of 2 years (2°C-8°C), protected from light is approvable.

After removing the cap, the injection must be started within 5 minutes to prevent the medicinal product 
from drying out and blocking the needle. If not used within 5 minutes of removing the cap, the PFS must 
be disposed of. 
Adventitious agents 
The cell banks have been tested for bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma. No material of human origin is used 
in  the  manufacturing  process  of  satralizumab.  All  animal-derived  ingredients  are  discussed,  and  risk 
mitigated following EMA/410/01 guideline. Certificates of origin have been supplied. Control measures 
for non-viral adventitious agents and TSE for raw materials are acceptable. 
Testing for adventitious agents on MCB, WCB and PPCs has been performed in accordance with ICH Q5A 
(R1). Original reports are provided. 
The quantitative virus risk assessment demonstrates an acceptable safety margin for the studied viruses 
in the manufacturing process including the retroviral clearance. 
The information presented supports adequate control of starting and raw materials including cell banks, 
IPCs for viral contamination in pre-harvest cell culture fluid and virus clearance by the manufacturing 
process.  
In conclusion, an acceptable safety level with regards to adventitious agents is demonstrated.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Enspryng dossier is of good quality.  
An enhanced science- and risk-based approach with QbD elements was used for process development 
and  process  evaluation,  supporting  the  proposed  manufacturing  process  control  strategy  and 
demonstrating a solid process understanding. The active substance and finished product manufacturing 
processes and process controls are described in sufficient detail. CPPs are identified and the processes 
are  appropriately  validated.  Comparability  was  demonstrated  for  the  material  from  three  active 
substance  process  versions  used  during  non-clinical  and  clinical  development.  Characterisation  of 
satralizumab  was  performed  using  an  extensive  panel  of  appropriate  methods.  The  overall  control 
strategy for the active substance and finished product is supported.  
The risk of nitrosating conditions or the presence of nitrosamines in the finished product was assessed 
in a risk evaluation, concluding the risk of nitrosamine impurities in the  finished product is negligible. 
The outcome of the nitrosamine risk evaluation is considered acceptable. 
The  information  provided  for  the  PFS  with  needle  safety  guard  is  comprehensive  and  confirms  the 
suitability of the chosen device.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing 
guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, controlled and 
validated.  The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  appropriate  specifications  are  set.  The 
manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality 
of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. Adventitious agents 
safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured.  
The overall quality of Enspryng is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. The application for marketing authorisation is recommended for approval from a 
quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Satralizumab has been constructed by modifying the amino acid sequence of tocilizumab (another anti-
human IL-6R licensed in the EU under the tradename RoActemra for the treatment of moderate to severe 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) to introduce some functional properties such as a pH-dependent binding to 
IL-6R. This property prolongs the antibody half-life by recycling the previously bound antibody via the 
endosome instead of lysosomal degradation. Moreover, satralizumab is an IgG2 isotype, which reduces 
Fc receptor effector functions compared with  tocilizumab (which is an IgG1 antibody).  The isoelectric 
point has been lowered by amino acid modifications with the aim of reducing non-specific elimination in 
the body. Finally, satralizumab has been modified to promote a stronger binding to neonatal Fc receptor 
in order to increase the antibody stability.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Mechanism of action 
The  proposed  mechanism  of  action  for  the  humanized  IgG2  anti-human  IL-6R  monoclonal  antibody 
satralizumab in the treatment of NMOSD includes binding to IL-6R (both soluble and membrane bound 
receptors on the surface of plasmablasts), inhibition of the IL-6 promoted survival of plasmablasts and 
their IL-6-stimulated production of AQP4‐IgG. The major pathological mechanism of injury in AQP4‐IgG 
seropositive NMOSD involves the AQP4‐IgG binding to aquaporin-4 water channels in the astrocytes of 
brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, followed by inflammation, disruption of blood–brain barrier, and CDC, 
with ensuing demyelination and axonal damage, and ultimately neurological symptoms characteristic of 
NMOSD. Markedly increased IL-6 levels have been observed in the serum  and  the  cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) of NMOSD patients, and CSF IL-6 levels are correlated with disease severity of NMOSD patients. 
In vitro studies 
Satralizumab showed cross-reactivity in cynomolgus  monkey  but not  in mice or rats.  Based  on these 
data, monkey was selected as the relevant species for nonclinical testing of satralizumab. A number of 
studies  were  conducted  to  characterize  the  nonclinical  pharmacology  of  satralizumab,  including  its 
binding  and  selectivity  to  human  and  cynomolgus  IL-6R  (membrane-bound  and  soluble),  binding  to 
human  and  cynomolgus  Fc  receptors,  induction  of  ADCC  and  CDC  activities,  and  its  functional  and 
selective inhibition of IL-6 activity via IL-6R.  
Binding  affinity  of  satralizumab  to  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  soluble  IL-6R  determined using  a 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay was similar with dissociation constant (KD) values of 1.5 nmol/L 
(0.22 µg/mL) and 2.0 nmol/L, respectively, at pH 7.4. Binding of satralizumab to human and cynomolgus 
membrane bound IL-6R expressed in Chinese hamster ovarian cells was determined by flow cytometry 
and resulted in a geometric mean EC50 of 0.019 μg/mL calculated for both species. The binding affinity 
to human soluble and membrane bound IL-6R in terms of KD and EC50 indicates that sufficient amounts 
of  satralizumab  will  be  available  for  binding  to  IL-6R  in  NMOSD  patients  following  SC  administration 
every 4th week with a median trough concentration (Ctrough) of 18.3 µg/mL at steady state.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 23/132 
 
 
  
  
The KD-values for binding to the human soluble IL-6R were increased up to ten-fold when the pH was 
decreased from 7.4 to 6.0 indicating that the binding affinity of satralizumab to human soluble IL-6R is 
pH-dependent and that the dissociation is more rapid at a pH relevant for the intra-cellular endosomal 
compartment  involved  in  the  transport  to  lysosomes.  Binding  affinity  of  satralizumab  to  human  and 
cynomolgus FcRn at acidic quasi-intra-endosomal conditions and to human and cynomolgus receptors 
for  IgG  (FcγR)  at  physiological  conditions  was  determined  by  SPR.  A  higher  binding  to  human  and 
cynomolgus FcRn for satralizumab (KD; 0.68 and 0.64 µM respectively) than for tocilizumab (KD; 2.76 
and  2.46  µM,  respectively)  or  a  conventional  immunoglobulin  G2  (IgG2;  KD  was  2.1  and  1.9  µM, 
respectively) was shown, which is expected to result in a prolongation of the plasma elimination half-life 
(t1/2). The binding of satralizumab to 8 types of human FcγR (Ia, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb) and 7 types of 
cynomolgus FcγR (Ia, IIa, IIb and IIIa), was either comparable to or weaker than that of the IgG2 control 
antibody, indicating a low potential for ADCC and CDC. Satralizumab was shown not to induce ADCC or 
CDC against U266 cells (human B-cells lymphoma) indicating that ADCC and CDC do not contribute to 
the mode of action of satralizumab. 
Satralizumab was shown to inhibit both classical IL-6 signalling (via membrane-bound IL-6R) and IL-6 
trans-signalling (via soluble IL-6R) in a concentration dependent manner when IL-6-induced proliferation 
of cells engineered to express both human gp130 and either human or cynomolgus monkey soluble and 
membrane bound IL-6R, were studied. On the contrary, no effect of satralizumab on signal transduction 
(classical  signalling)  via  the  receptors  of  other  human  gp130-family  cytokines  (including  ciliary 
neurotrophic factor, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, interleukin 11), measured by effects on 
proliferation of cells engineered to express these gp130 receptors, were observed. 
Satralizumab inhibited IL-6-stimulated proliferation of PHA-L-activated human peripheral blood T cells 
(half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]; 4.4 µg/mL) and production of monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1, IC50; 0.17 µg/mL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, IC50; 0.44 µg/mL) in 
human fibroblast-like synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients (HFLS-RA) stimulated by IL-6 and 
soluble IL-6R, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, satralizumab inhibited IL-6-dependent IgG1 
production, i.e. antibody production, from human plasmablasts shown by measuring the levels of IgG1 
in supernatants of plasmablasts cultured in the presence of IL-6.  
No data on the effect of satralizumab on production of plasmablast AQP4-IgG, which are thought to be 
involved in the pathophysiology of a large part of NMOSD patients and the inhibition of therefore would 
constitute a likely mode of action for satralizumab in the treatment of NMOSD, were however provided. 
Furthermore,  the  results  indicating  an  inhibitory  effect  of  satralizumab  on  IL-6-induced  antibody 
production in plasmablasts from healthy donors are weak, for a major part of the 12 donors there was 
either a very small or no decrease in IgG1 production.   
In vivo studies 
As  satralizumab  showed  cross-reactivity  in  cynomolgus  monkey  but  not  in  mice  or  rats,  in  vivo 
pharmacology  of  satralizumab  was  studied  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  efficacy  of  satralizumab  in 
NMOSD  models  in  vivo  have  not  been  investigated  since  no  NMOSD  model  has  been  established  in 
monkeys. The pharmacology of satralizumab and tocilizumab was studied in terms of inhibitory effects 
on IL-6-stimulated C-reactive protein (CRP) production (i.e. on classical signaling), free and total (both 
free IL-6R and receptor bound to satralizumab) soluble IL-6R concentration (i.e. on trans-signaling).  
Following a single subcutaneous dose of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg satralizumab and 1 and 2 mg/kg tocilizumab, 
preliminary  PK  data  showed  that  the  maximum  concentrations  (Cmax)  in  plasma  of  satralizumab  and 
tocilizumab were similar, whereas the residence time was higher for satralizumab. Satralizumab were 
maintained at a high concentration in plasma for a longer time compared with tocilizumab. 
The maximum effect in reduction of CRP protein production was achieved at a plasma concentration of 
10  μg/ml  of  satralizumab.  Satralizumab  inhibited  IL-6-induced  CRP  production  at  a  level  of  plasma 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 24/132 
 
 
  
  
concentration comparable to that of tocilizumab, indicating that the potency to inhibit CRP production in 
vivo was similar for both antibodies. However, given that satralizumab concentration was maintained 
longer  than  tocilizumab  concentration,  the  effect  of  satralizumab  had  a  longer  duration,  as  it  was 
expected after satralizumab structural modifications. 
The decrease in free soluble IL-6R after satralizumab and tocilizumab administration indicated that both 
antibodies were able to bind to soluble IL-6R with similar potency. However, when antibody concentration 
fell  below  the  limit  of  quantification  (BLQ),  an  increase  of  free  soluble  IL-6R  above  basal  levels  was 
found.  Accordingly,  presence  of  satralizumab  or  tocilizumab  increased  total  soluble  IL-6R  levels.  The 
binding of soluble antigen to satralizumab is reported to reduce the clearance of antigen as satralizumab, 
with a long half-life, serves as a carrier for the antigen (Igawa 2010). 
However, given that CRP and free soluble IL-6R are both general inflammatory biomarkers not specific 
for  NMOSD  and  that  satralizumab  has  not  been  studied  in  any  disease  model  in  vivo,  additional 
clarification regarding the mechanism of action of satralizumab and the role of classical signalling and 
trans-signalling  in  NMO  was  required  by  the  Applicant.  In  the  response,  the  Applicant  clarified  that 
satralizumab affects both the classical and the trans-signalling pathways of IL-6 and that experimental 
models of the human NMOSD disease are very limited why the signalling effects via the IL-6 pathway in 
the disease setting need to be studied in the human disease context. Further, while blockage of IL-6R 
seems to be a rather non-specific interventional approach to NMOSD, it is similar to the likewise non-
specific approach taken to RA which is based on the overall benefit of blockage of the pleiotropic actions 
of IL-6 in inflammatory diseases. This was agreed, and no further clarification was considered required 
for the mechanism of action of satralizumab.   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  specific  secondary  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  studies  were  provided.  Studies  showing  antigenic 
specificity for IL-6R compared to receptors of other hgpg130-family cytokine and lack of ADCC or CDC 
activity in B cell lymphoma cells, indicating low potential for such activities, are provided. Furthermore, 
studies of in vitro tissue cross-reactivity of satralizumab showing comparable staining patterns between 
human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues  matching  tissues  reported  as  sites  of  IL-6R  expression  and 
studies not indicating a high risk of cytokine release in human blood were provided. As IL-6R are widely 
spread  and  binding  to  these  receptors  in  tissues  and  organs  may  exert  effects  on  other  biological 
functions than the intended effects in plasmablasts, a discussion of potential risks theoretically related 
to blockade of IL-6R in NMOSD patients would have been valuable. Overall, the provided data, i.e. the 
non-clinical in vitro data referred to above together with the lack of toxicological target organs or tissues 
identified in the toxicological studies in cynomolgus monkey, a pharmacologically relevant species, were 
however considered sufficient and no further discussions were requested.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
With reference to applicable guidelines, effects on the central nervous, respiratory, and  cardiovascular 
systems  were  evaluated  in  a  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  young  adult  cynomolgus  monkeys.  No 
significant effects on cardiovascular (electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure), respiratory, or central 
nervous  system  functions  were  shown  following  subcutaneous  administration  of  2,  10  and  50  mg/kg 
satralizumab once weekly for 4 or 26 weeks with exposure levels providing acceptable margins to the 
clinical exposure. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No PDs drug interaction studies have been conducted.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Satralizumab showed cross-reactivity in cynomolgus monkey but not in mice or rats. The non-clinical 
pharmacokinetics of satralizumab was evaluated in the toxicological species cynomolgus monkeys after 
single SC and IV administration (PK) and after multiple SC administration in the repeated-dose toxicity 
studies (TK). 
Analytical methods 
The  method  used  for  analyses  of  satralizumab  in  plasma  in non-clinical  GLP  studies  was  an  enzyme-
linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  using human  soluble  IL-6R  as the  capture  reagent,  biotinylated 
rabbit  anti-satralizumab  antibody  that  recognizes  the  complementarity-determining  region  (CDR)  of 
satralizumab,  and  streptavidin-peroxidase  conjugate  as  detection  reagents  for  spectrophotometrically 
quantification of immobilised biotinylated satralizumab. It is not clear if the validation of the method was 
performed in accordance with GLP. The applicant was therefore asked to clarify this and if GLP was not 
confirmed the applicant should describe on which aspects the method deviates from GLP and potential 
impact on the results of the analyses. In the response, the Applicant declared that the validation study 
was conducted in accordance with Japanese law “Enforcement Regulations of the Pharmaceutical Affairs 
Law,  Article  43  (Reliability  Criteria  of  Application  Data)”  as  stated  in  the  report    -ensuring  reliability 
criteria  such  as  accuracy,  completeness/integrity,  and  preservation/retention,  in  a  manner  largely 
consistent with GLP principles.  In addition, this validation study was inspected by the Quality Assurance 
Unit in the laboratory, and the QA statement is attached to the study report. 
It is therefore concluded by the Assessor that although the method validation study for determination of 
satralizumab in monkey plasma was conducted under non-GLP conditions it was performed in a manner 
largely  consistent  with  GLP  principles.  Acceptance  criteria  for  e.g.  specificity,  dilution,  stability, 
robustness, the calibration curve, precision and accuracy were met and documented. In addition, the 
validation  study  was  audited  and  accepted  by  the  Quality  Assurance  Unit  in  the  laboratory  which  is 
documented in a QA statement attached to the study report.  
Absorption 
PK  parameters  of  satralizumab  were  calculated  using  plasma  concentration  versus  time  data  after 
excluding the time points with detected anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). 
Single dose 
The PK of satralizumab following SC single dose administration of 0.4 to 50 mg/kg to male cynomolgus 
monkeys  was  non-linear  with  a  higher  than  dose  proportional  increase  in  exposure  in  terms  of  Area 
under the concentration-time curve from time zero to inﬁnity (AUCinf) (but not Cmax and Area under the 
concentration-time  curve  from  hour  0  to  day  7  (AUC0-7d))  between  the  2  lowest  doses,  0.4  and  2.0 
mg/kg. This was possibly due to target mediated drug distribution and saturation of binding to the target 
(membrane-bound IL-6R expressed in tissues). 
Absorption of satralizumab from SC tissue was slow, mean Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) ranged 
from 3.3 to 4.0 days. Elimination of satralizumab was slow with mean plasma t1/2 values of 2.2 to 4.0 
days at 0.4 and 2.0 mg/kg, which increased to 22.7 and 18.4 days at 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively.  
Apparent bioavailability calculated by comparison AUCinf following SC administration with AUCinf following 
IV  administration  was  78.2,  62.3  and  71.4%  following  doses  of  0.4,  10  and  50  mg/kg,  respectively, 
indicating good absorption from SC tissues. 
As for SC administration, the PK of Intravenous (IV) administered satralizumab was non-linear, probably 
due to target mediated drug distribution.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 26/132 
 
 
  
  
When the dose was increased from 0.4 mg/kg to above 2 mg/kg total clearance (CLtotal) decreased (mean 
CLtotal decreased from 12.3 mL/day/kg at 0.4 mg/kg to 2.29-2.40 at 10-50 mg/kg, respectively) and the 
t1/2 increased (mean t1/2 increased from 1.9 day at 0.4 mg/kg to 22.6-25.8 days at 10-50 mg/kg). This 
resulted in a higher than dose proportional increase in exposure (AUCinf) between the lowest dose of 0.4 
and above 2.0 mg/kg. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) ranged from 44.9 mL/kg at 0.4 
mg/kg to 68.2-70.8 mL/kg at 10-50 mg/kg, which is close to the cynomolgus monkey plasma volume 
(45 mL/kg), suggesting limited tissue distribution of satralizumab. 
Repeated dose 
Toxicokinetics  of  satralizumab  were  determined  in  male  and  female  cynomolgus  monkeys  following 
repeated SC administration of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg once weekly for 4 and 26-weeks. 
Based on Cmax and AUC0-7d steady state appears to have been reached after the 13th dose (i.e. 12 weeks) 
for the 2 and 10 mg/kg dose levels, which is in line with the t1/2 of up to 18 to 23 estimated for the 10 
and 50 mg/kg dose levels following single SC administration. For the 50 mg/kg dose level the exposure 
was increased up to the last 26th dose.  
Due to the long t1/2 the dosing once weekly is expected to result in accumulation during treatment. The 
accumulation  (AUC0-7d  ratio  relative  to  1st  dosing)  ranged  from  2.7  to  11.6  after  the  26th  weekly 
administration.  
The AUCinf following single dose treatment and AUC0-7d after the 13th dose were approximately similar 
for the 10 and 50 mg/kg dose level indicating time-independent PK at these dose levels.  
There was an approximately dose proportional exposure in terms of Cmax and AUC0-7d after the 13th dose.  
No  obvious  sex  differences  in  PK  were  found,  except  for  single dose  data  calculated  for  Day  1  which 
resulted in higher accumulation in females than in males. 
Distribution 
No dedicated distribution studies of satralizumab were provided. The Applicant refers to an in vitro tissue 
cross reactivity study which showed a staining pattern which was largely consistent with what is known 
regarding  IL-6R  expression  and  which  was  similar  in  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissue.  A 
justification why no standard tissue distribution study, which might have revealed valuable information 
(e.g. potential for passage over the blood-brain-barrier to CNS), have been performed was not provided. 
It was however acknowledged that interpretation of distribution studies with radiolabelled biologics would 
have been expected to be confounded by in vivo metabolism, release of label from the protein following 
degradation, and potential reincorporation of radiolabelled amino acids into the endogenous protein pool. 
Furthermore, the available data and information, i.e. a volume of distribution that indicates limited tissue 
distribution together with that no toxicological target organs or tissues were identified in the toxicological 
studies in cynomolgus monkey, did not raise any concerns. Overall, the data provided were therefore 
considered sufficient. 
The results of the enhanced Pre- and Postnatal Development (ePPND) study with exposure levels during 
the  postnatal  period  which  were  almost  analogous  between  dams  and  their  infants  and  very  low 
concentrations in the milk suggested that satralizumab passed the blood-placenta barrier and that the 
infants were exposed to satralizumab during their dams’ pregnant period. 
Metabolism and excretion 
The expected consequence of metabolism of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is the degradation 
to small peptides and individual amino acids and small peptides and amino acids produced by catabolism 
are expected to be excreted in urine or added to the endogenous amino acid pool.

2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of satralizumab has been evaluated in a toxicology programme consistent with ICH 
S6. The pivotal toxicology studies were conducted in accordance with GLP standards and regulations. 
Cynomolgus  monkey  was  used  as  toxicology  species  based  on  that  Cynomolgus  monkey  has  shown 
pharmacological  effects  comparable  to  those  in  humans  in  IL-6R  binding  assays  and  also  the 
satralizumab mediated neutralization of IL-6 via soluble IL-6R. Since there was no cross-reactivity with 
satralizumab in mouse or rat, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as an appropriate animal species 
for nonclinical safety evaluation. In a tissue cross-reactivity study, similar staining patterns were seen 
in cynomolgus and human tissues, and the results matched the information already reported as IL-6R-
expressing  sites.  Collectively,  the  monkey  is  considered  a  relevant  species  and  the  only  reasonable 
species for these investigations. 
The pivotal toxicology  studies were performed with SC  injection  as this is the route of administration 
that  will  be  used  clinically.  Evaluation  of  general  toxicity  was  performed  by  weekly  administration  of 
satralizumab to cynomolgus monkeys for up to 4 weeks by the IV route (up to 200mg/kg/week) and up 
to 26 weeks by the SC route (up to 50mg/kg/week). 
No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  the  programme  since  satralizumab  is  an  IgG  class 
antibody and therefore unlikely to directly interact with DNA or other chromosomal components. Further, 
no  standard  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  undertaken  with  the  substance,  as  standard 
carcinogenicity assays are considered inappropriate for several reasons. 
Evaluation  of  the  effects  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development  was  performed  in  an  ePPND  study  in 
cynomolgus monkeys. This study was also intended to support dosing of satralizumab in the pediatric 
population of  NMOSD  patients.  The ePPND  study  did  not  identify major causes for concern. An infant 
from a dam exposed to the highest dose died from multiple inflammations. While it could not be ruled 
out that the immune-modulatory effect of IL-6 could have an impact on the ability to mount an immune 
response to an infection leading to septicaemia in this case, it is agreed that a causative relation between 
the effects on IL-6 levels and the infant death was not apparent. The clinical relevance of the effects on 
IL-6 remained elusive but will become apparent with further clinical development. 
The toxicokinetics of satralizumab has been characterized in all the preclinical toxicity studies including 
the  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  study.  The  toxicokinetic  profile  of  satralizumab  with  low 
clearance  and  a  long  t1/2  is  expected  as  satralizumab  was  constructed  by  modifying  the  amino  acid 
sequence  of  tocilizumab  with  the  aim  of  prolonging  its  plasma  residence  time  by  decreasing  both 
nonspecific IgG clearance and antigen-dependent IgG clearance. Satralizumab exposure was generally 
similar in males and females across all studies. 
ADAs development was commonly seen in the  studies in monkey (overall incidence  of 12-22%), and 
some  animals  showed  neutralization  activity.  These  animals  often  showed  reduced  exposure  to 
satralizumab and were excluded in the TK calculations. However, given the relatively low incidence of 
ADAs, the overall validity of the studies was retained. While the immunogenicity of a product in animals 
(including monkeys) is usually a poor predictor of the immunogenicity in humans, neutralizing ADAs for 
satralizumab have been noted also in the clinical studies. 
Satralizumab was considered well tolerated in monkeys up to doses of 50mg/kg/week, as the toxicities 
seen in the programme are few and non-adverse.

Single dose toxicity 
Acute  toxicity  assessment  was  conducted  by  observation  and  tests  after  the  first  administration  to 
cynomolgus  monkeys  in  three  repeat-dose  studies.  As  results,  no  noteworthy  toxicity  changes  were 
observed. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Three repeat-dose toxicity studies have  been submitted in  support of the MAA for  satralizumab: One 
non-GLP 4-week study using once-weekly IV administration, one GLP 4-week study using once-weekly 
SC  administration  and  one  GLP  26-week  study  (with  13-week  recovery)  using  once-weekly  SC 
administration. No mortalities were evident in the studies, and no obvious target organ of toxicity was 
identified. The small (1monkey/sex/group) non-GLP study using IV-administration up to 200mg/kg/week 
showed  that  satralizumab  is  well-tolerated  in  the  Cynomolgus  monkey.  No  toxicological  effects  were 
reported,  and  the  only  noteworthy  finding  was  ADA-development  which  resulted  in  lower  plasma 
satralizumab exposure.  
In  the  4-week  SC  study,  higher  IL-6-levels  were  noted  in  the  treated  groups,  especially  early  after 
satralizumab  administration.  This  is  likely  a  reflection  of  the  Ab  blockade  of  the  IL-6R.  Safety-
pharmacology  parameters  (ECG  and  blood-pressure)  were  included  in  the  study,  but  no  effects  were 
reported. ADAs development was more prominent in the SC study compared to the IV study. 11 animals 
were positive for ADAs and neutralizing characterization was also confirmed in 4 animals of them. The 
observation that SC administration can pose a higher immunogenicity risk than IV administration for a 
given protein is not unexpected as it has been noted previously for other similar products. 
26 weeks of satralizumab treatment using SC dosing was well tolerated, and no adverse toxicities were 
noted.  As  in  the  shorter  4-week  study,  the  most  apparent  treatment  related  effects  noted  were 
pharmacological increases of IL-6 with weak dose-relation. This increase did apparently not translate to 
down-stream toxicities. Several animals were positive for ADAs. While some also showed neutralizing 
activity, the mean TK analyses were only marginally affected such that the exposure at the two highest 
doses and for the majority at the lower dose, was maximized throughout dosing. 
Seminology and testicular assessments was undertaken throughout the study, including histopathology 
of the reproductive tract tissues at study termination. While no clear treatment relations were noted, the 
overall background of testicular lesions was increased. According to the Applicant, the underlying reason 
was that animals used in this study were of Chinese origin which according to the Applicant have shown 
a tendency towards  slightly higher incidence  of  testicular lesions compared with those  from  Vietnam. 
One male in the 2mg/kg/week group had bilateral atrophy (marked) in the seminiferous tubules which 
apparently exceeded the normal background histopathology findings. The Applicant (the CRO) presented 
a plausible sequence of explanations, including the fact that the batch from which this animal was taken 
(432) had an approximately 3-fold higher incidence (57%) of tubular atrophy when compared to animals 
of the other batches (388 and 417) used for this study. Further, this animal was clearly shown to have 
neutralizing ADAs titers which reduced exposure. Finally, the animal was lowest in rank among his cage 
mates, which was also evident from lower weight and fights that required veterinary treatment. While 
the causative relation of some of the explanations to the study findings could be questioned, it is overall 
agreed that the atrophy of the seminiferous tubules (including findings of reduced ejaculate weight and 
sperm count) in this animal may be incidental.  
However,  a  major  reason  leading  up  to  this  conclusion  is  the  fact  that  the  background  findings  are 
substantial and scattered across groups why it is difficult to identify a treatment relation. Thus, given 
the  low  number  of  animals  per  group  (because  it  is  a  monkey  study),  the  fact  that  it  is  a  male-only 
mediated effect (which reduces the n even more), and the high background of similar but less severe 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 29/132 
 
 
  
  
findings, it is possible that a real treatment effect may be masked. In addition, the membrane bound IL-
6R was shown to be present on sperm surface from head to the end of flagellum (Lachance and Leclerc 
2011). Furthermore, the IL6ST (IL6R heterodimerization with the signal transducer protein GP130) was 
detected in both the peritubular space and seminiferous tubules of human testes. This could serve as 
the molecular link to seminiferous tubular atrophy  and head defects in the sperm morphology and/or 
impaired  capacitation  observed  in  the  monkeys.  Therefore,  as  the  product  is  intended  for  chronic 
treatment  of  patients  from  the  age  of  12  years  old,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  clinical 
relevance of these findings and if appropriate modify the wording in section 5.3 of the SmPC accordingly. 
In  the response provided, the Applicant pointed out that although there is experimental evidence that 
IL-6  affects  sperm  development,  there  is  no  experimental  evidence  that inhibition  of  IL-6R  signalling 
may  result  in  the  particular  findings  observed  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  monkeys  with 
satralizumab.  In  addition,  supportive  evidence  from  the  monkey  toxicity  studies  conducted  with 
tocilizumab, another IL-6R antibody, did not evidence the testis as a target organ of toxicity upon IL-6R 
inhibition. Collectively, based on the information and reasoning provided by the Applicant, the testicular 
findings  observed  in  monkeys  were  not  considered  to  be  related  to  the  treatment  with  satralizumab. 
Further, no clinical or non-clinical fertility or reproductive toxicity findings were included in the SmPCs 
of other anti-IL-6R antibodies tocilizumab or sarilumab.  
As previously noted, satralizumab was generated as a result of amendments of the tocilizumab molecule. 
Based  on  the  tocilizumab  European  Public  Assessment  Report  (EPAR),  no  effects  on  organs  of  the 
reproductive system were seen in a chronic primate toxicity study. The EPAR further notes that there is 
also no preclinical evidence that IL-6 signalling is involved in processes of reproduction. While it is unclear 
if  the  chronic  toxicity  study  referred  to  included  histopathology  of  the  reproductive  organs  enabling 
identification of the seminiferous tubule atrophy, the overall conclusions from the studies do not signify 
effects on the reproductive organs. Therefore, collectively, the effects noted in the reproductive tract 
after  satralizumab  exposure  is  likely  indirect  effects  of  background  findings in  the particular breed  of 
monkeys.  Further,  the  increased  findings  in  one  male  from  the  2mg/kg/week  group  are  not  likely  a 
consequence of satralizumab exposure. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been undertaken, since satralizumab is a biotechnology-derived 
substance not expected to interact with DNA. The lack of genotoxicity testing for satralizumab was 
considered acceptable.  
Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed.  Standard  carcinogenicity  assays  are  generally 
inappropriate  for  biotechnology-derived  products  for  several  reasons.  Further,  no  appropriate  species 
commonly used for such assays can be identified for satralizumab, why no carcinogenicity studies can 
(or should) be performed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No  stand-alone  fertility  and  early  embryonic  study  or  embryofoetal  development  studies  have  been 
performed. Detailed evaluation of male and female reproductive organs was performed in the 4- and 26-
week SC repeat-dose toxicology studies. No  adverse  effects on fertility parameters  were found which 
were related to satralizumab. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 30/132 
 
 
  
  
The only reproductive and developmental study performed with satralizumab is an ePPND study designed 
to  evaluate  the  potential  effects  of  satralizumab  on  pregnancy  loss,  embryo-fetal  development, 
parturition, survival and postnatal development of the offspring. Only two dose-levels plus control were 
used in this study. The highest dose in the study was 50 mg/kg/week. The same high-dose level was 
used in the 4- and 26-week studies. The dose was not associated with satralizumab induced toxicity in 
these studies but provided margins of exposure around 20-30 why it is considered an appropriate high-
dose in this study.  
IgG is transferred through the placenta mainly via the neonatal Fc receptor in later pregnancy, and the 
infant exposure was very similar to the maternal exposure from post-natal days (PND) 14 (the earliest 
measurement  in  the  infants)  supporting  that  satralizumab  can  pass  the  placenta.  Overall  the 
concentrations of satralizumab in breast milk were low (<0.9% of the corresponding maternal plasma 
levels) and the Cmax in milk was around 1ug/ml in high-dosed mothers. This information was included in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC (reproductive toxicity). Upon request, the Applicant agreed to include in section 
4.6 of the SmPC (subsection on breast-feeding) the standard formulation for monoclonal antibodies as 
requested by the Safety Working Party “ It is unknown whether  Enspryng is excreted in human milk. 
Human IgG is known to be excreted in breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing 
to low concentrations soon afterwards;  consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot  be  excluded 
during this short period. Afterwards, use of Enspryng could be considered during breast-feeding only if 
clinically needed” 
Satralizumab did not induce adverse effects (AEs) in maternal animals or on pregnancy outcome or fetal 
development  until  PND  293.  In  addition,  no  effects  were  found  in  a  learning  ability  test  (Wisconsin 
General Testing Apparatus) which was started at the age of 6 months and was fully completed at PND293. 
However, one infant in the 50mg/kg/week group had had multiple inflammations (pulmonary, cardiac, 
splenic, cerebral, renal) and died from septicaemia. This death could possibly be related to the treatment. 
An association could not be ruled out given the immunomodulatory effect of the treatment.  
Reticulocytes  and  while  blood  cells  (WBC)  counts  were  clearly  reduced  in  the  drug  treated  groups. 
According to the Applicant, the effects were not test-item related. While the levels in the treated groups 
were  within  the  reference  values  given  by  the  Applicant  and  not  adverse,  the  changes  were  clearly 
treatment  related.  Later  time-points  showed  a  regression  to  control  values,  perhaps  suggesting 
homeostatic mechanisms. The platelet counts were also clearly reduced at PND 28, and while the control 
value was high, the changes in the treated groups were considered related to treatment. 
IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the pups administered the highest dose throughout postnatal 
maturation, and effects were noted at earlier time-points in the lower dose group. IL-6 levels correlated 
with disease severity, why this is problematic. Further potential long-term effects of this lengthy IL-6 
increase was unclear.  
T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) response in the PND 147 infants was evaluated using keyhole 
limpet  hemocyanin,  which  is  a  recognized  T-cell  dependent  antigen  that  gives  a  robust  antibody 
response.  From  the  data  presented  on  antigenic  challenge,  there  was  no  apparent  treatment-related 
effect on the overall ability to generate a T-cell dependent antibody response. In addition, the kinetics 
for the IgM and IgG responses were similar for all groups. However, there was a treatment effect on the 
IgG and IgM titers generated. According to the Applicant, statistically significant effects  had not been 
reached due to high inter-animal variability. This variability is common for this assay and may well be 
due  to  individual  differences  in  the  kinetics  of  the  response.  For  such  situations,  a  more  informative 
presentation  can  be  to  express  the  data  as the  sum  of  the  antibody  response  over  several  collection 
dates (AUC-values). According to the Applicant, the reduction in IgG in the 50mg/kg/week group could 
be considered to be related to satralizumab exposure. However, the basis for not considering the effects 
in the 2 mg/kg/week group as treatment related were unclear.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 31/132 
 
 
  
  
Thus collectively, there were treatment related changes on several parameters (i.e. WBC counts, CD20+ 
B-cells,  TDAR)  considered  important  for  a  fully  functional  immune  system  for  which  the  collective 
significance is uncertain. Further, IL-6 levels were increased in the infants post-partum reflecting that 
the foetus is exposed to increased IL-6 levels during pregnancy.  In addition, an infant died on PND 40 
with  multiple  inflammations  which  may  be  treatment  related.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to 
further discuss the findings mentioned and elaborate on the relations to treatment and clinical relevance. 
In the response, the Applicant agreed that the IL-6 levels were increased in the infants postpartum, and 
that this was likely a consequence of satralizumab exposure during late pregnancy. This is expected, as 
it is generally held that foetal human exposure to monoclonal antibodies occur during the third trimester 
in humans and that a similar trend is seen in non-human primates. Further, since the reduction in TDAR 
was considered minor in the analysed infants, it was the Applicant’s view that it was unlikely that the 
death of an infant in the 50mg/kg group was related to a pro-inflammatory effect of IL-6. 
However, it could not be ruled out that the immune-modulatory effect of IL-6 could have an impact on 
the ability to mount an immune response to an infection leading to septicaemia as was seen in the infant 
which died. Overall, it was agreed that a causative relation between the effects on IL-6 levels and the 
infant death is not apparent. The clinical relevance of the effects on IL-6 remained elusive but will become 
apparent with further clinical development.  
Juvenile toxicity 
No stand-alone juvenile toxicity studies have been performed. According to the Applicant the provided 
ePPND study is sufficient for an evaluation of potential effects of the substance in the juvenile setting. It 
is agreed that the exposure levels seen in the juveniles from PND 14 and forward were similar to the 
exposure levels in the dams, but the relevance of the actual exposure for the juvenile clinical situation 
was questionable.  
The  exposure  obtained  in  the  juvenile  period  in  this  study  was  constantly  declining,  as  it  reflected 
clearance of the drug which is remaining in the animals from birth. Further, from PND 119 or 200 (in the 
2mg/kg/week and 50mg/kg/week group respectively) the drug level was not measurable. 
In the clinical situation, the children and adolescents will be administered satralizumab SC with a weekly 
administration regimen. While replicating the clinical dosing is not critical, obtaining adequate systemic 
exposure is considered paramount. Because of confounding effects on maternal care of offspring, dosing 
of  the  mother  post-partum  is  generally  not  recommended.  A  possibility  to  increase  exposure  not 
discussed  by  the  Applicant  was  direct  exposure  of  the  juveniles.  This  would  have  ensured  a  relevant 
dosing of the infants throughout the study period and enable a more clinically relevant setting. However, 
the ePPND study performed was conducted in compliance with the agreed PIP, why no further studies 
were considered needed.  
Toxicokinetic data 
In all in vivo-studies, the exposure increased in a roughly dose-proportionate manner and with no or 
minor sex differences in exposure. Accumulation was noted after repeated dosing throughout the studies. 
In the ePPND study, exposure in infants were similar to the exposure in the dams on PND 14, suggesting 
placental transport in later pregnancy.   
Local Tolerance  
No study has been provided by the Applicant.

Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity 
A  cross-reactivity  study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  potential  cross-reactivity  of  fluorescein-
conjugated  satralizumab  (with  cryosections  of  normal  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues).  The 
staining pattern produced was consistent with what is known regarding IL-6R expression in e.g. adrenal 
cells,  liver,  macrophages,  and  lymphocytes,  and  the  staining  pattern  was  similar  in  human  and 
Cynomolgus monkey tissue. Additional staining  was  either cross-reactivity  or previously  non-reported 
IL-6 expression sites. 
Blood compatibility  
Based on a blood compatibility study where the haemolytic and precipitation potential of satralizumab 
was evaluated in human blood and plasma respectively, it could be concluded that satralizumab did not 
show any haemolytic or precipitation potential. 
In vitro estimation of the risk of cytokine release syndrome 
Based  on  a  human  in  vitro  blood  cytokine  assay,  the  potential  of  satralizumab  to  induce  a  cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS) is considered to be low in terms of incidence and increase in cytokines. This 
information was included in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has provided a justification for not performing ERA studies. The drug product is composed 
of naturally occurring amino acids, why satralizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The rationale is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
The proposed mechanism of action for satralizumab in the treatment of NMOSD includes binding to IL-
6R (both soluble and membrane-bound), inhibition of the IL-6 promoted survival of plasmablasts and 
their IL-6-stimulated production of AQP4‐IgG, a major pathological mechanism in AQP4‐IgG seropositive 
NMOSD patients.  
Satralizumab showed cross-reactivity in cynomolgus  monkey  but not  in mice or rats.  Based  on these 
data, monkey was selected as the relevant species for nonclinical testing of satralizumab. 
Findings  from  in  vitro  studies  indicated  that  sufficient  amounts  of  satralizumab  will  be  available  for 
binding to IL-6R in NMOSD patients following SC administration every 4th week with a median Ctrough 
of 18.3 µg/mL at steady state.  Furthermore  in vitro  results supported  that satralizumab inhibits both 
classical  IL-6  signalling  (via  membrane-bound  IL-6R)  and  IL-6  trans-signalling  (via  soluble  IL-6R) 
preventing IL-6 downstream signalling through these two pathways. In vitro results indicated that ADCC 
and CDC do not contribute to the mode of action of satralizumab.  
The efficacy of satralizumab in NMOSD models in vivo have not been investigated since no NMOSD model 
has  been  established  in  monkeys.  Instead,  the  pharmacology  of  satralizumab  and  tocilizumab  was 
studied in terms of inhibitory effects on IL-6-stimulated CRP production (i.e. on classical signalling), free 
and total (both free IL-6R and receptor bound to satralizumab) soluble IL-6R concentration (i.e. on trans-
signalling). Results confirmed similar potency to inhibit CRP production and to bind to soluble IL-6R for 
both products. However, given that CRP and free soluble IL-6R are both general inflammatory biomarkers 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 33/132 
 
 
  
  
not  specific  for  NMOSD  and  that  satralizumab  has  not  been  studied  in  any  disease  model  in  vivo, 
additional  clarification  regarding  the  mechanism  of  action  of  satralizumab  and  the  role  of  classical 
signalling  and  trans-signalling  in  NMO  was  required  by  the  Applicant.  The  Applicant  recognized  that 
further results are needed to understand the impact on preventing IL-6 downstream signalling specifically 
on NMOSD. Nevertheless, NMOSD patients could benefit from the anti-inflammatory effects following a 
blockage of the pleiotropic actions of IL-6 as described in other immune-mediated conditions (e.g. RA). 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  this  argumentation  and  no  further  clarifications  were  required  during  the 
procedure on this aspect.  
No  specific  secondary  PD  studies  were  provided.  Taking  into  consideration  data  supporting  the  low 
potential for ADCC or CDC activities, the lack of high risk of CRS and lack of toxicological target organs 
or tissues identified in the toxicological studies in cynomolgus monkey, no secondary PD studies were 
considered necessary.  
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were conducted, but endpoints were included in the 26-weeks 
pivotal  toxicity  study  in  monkeys.  No  adverse  functional  or  structural  effects  in  cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and central nervous systems were observed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The method used for analyses  of satralizumab  in plasma in non-clinical GLP studies was ELISA using 
human  soluble  IL-6R  as  the  capture  reagent,  biotinylated  rabbit  anti-satralizumab  antibody  that 
recognizes  the  CDR  of  satralizumab,  and  streptavidin-peroxidase  conjugate  as  detection  reagents  for 
spectrophotometrically  quantification  of  immobilised  biotinylated  satralizumab.  During  the  procedure, 
the Applicant clarified that although  the method  validation study  for determination of satralizumab in 
monkey  plasma  was  conducted  under  non-GLP  conditions,  it  was  performed  in  a  manner  largely 
consistent  with  GLP  principles  and  the  validation  study  was  audited  and  accepted  by  the  Quality 
Assurance Unit in the laboratory 
Nonclinical PK studies with satralizumab were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys following single SC or 
IV administration repeated SC administration of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg once weekly for 4 and 26-weeks. 
Results  indicated  a  good  absorption  from  SC  tissues,  limited  tissue  distribution  and  slow  elimination. 
Overall, no obvious sex differences in PK were found.  
The results of the ePPND study suggested that satralizumab passed the blood-placenta barrier and that 
the  infants  were  exposed  to  satralizumab  during  their  dams’  pregnant  period.  Upon  request,  the 
Applicant agreed to include in SmPC section on breast-feeding the standard formulation for monoclonal 
antibodies as requested by the Safety Working Party.  
Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of satralizumab has been characterised in Cynomolgus monkey in studies up to 26 
weeks duration. The doses chosen are considered appropriate to characterise the toxicity of satralizumab 
and to make proper risk assessments. During the procedure, the Applicant was asked to further discuss 
the  relevance  of  testicular  findings  observed  in  monkeys.  Based  on  the  information  and  reasoning 
provided  by  the  Applicant,  these  findings  were  not  considered  to  be  related  to  the  treatment  with 
satralizumab.  No  AE  of  treatment  have  been  identified  in  the  study  programme  suggesting  that  the 
treatment was well tolerated in monkeys.  
No  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  performed  which  can  be  agreed  for  the 
aforementioned reasons.   
The ePPND study performed to evaluate potential developmental toxicity did not identify major causes 
for concern. This information has been included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. During the procedure, the 
Applicant further discussed the potential role of satralizumab on the death from multiple inflammations 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 34/132 
 
 
  
  
of an infant from a dam exposed to the highest dose. While it could not be ruled out that the immune-
modulatory  effect  of  IL-6  could  have  an  impact  on  the  ability  to  mount  an  immune  response  to  an 
infection  leading  to  septicaemia  in  this  case,  it  can  be  agreed  that  a  causative  relation  between  the 
effects on IL-6 levels and the infant death was not apparent. The clinical relevance of the effects on IL-
6 remained elusive but will become apparent with further clinical development.  
ADAs development was commonly seen in the  studies in monkey  (overall  incidence  of 12-22%), and 
some  animals  showed  neutralization  activity.  However,  the  immunogenicity  of  a  product  in  animals 
(including monkeys) is usually a poor predictor of the immunogenicity in humans.  
An in vitro blood cytokine assay did not identify a high risk of CRS. This information has been included 
in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Satralizumab was considered well tolerated in monkeys up to doses of 50mg/kg/week, as the toxicities 
seen in the programme are few and non-adverse.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The CHMP agrees on the justification for not performing ERA studies based on composition of naturally 
occurring amino acids. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  non-clinical  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  satralizumab  inhibits  both  classical  IL-6 
signalling and IL-6 trans-signalling preventing IL-6 downstream signalling through these two pathways. 
No NMOSD model has been established in cynomolgus monkey and therefore, efficacy in in vivo NMOSD 
models has not been investigated. Non-clinical PK studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys indicated 
a good absorption from SC tissues, limited tissue distribution and slow elimination.  
Non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. An in vitro blood 
cytokine assay did not identify a high risk of CRS. This information has been included in section 5.3 of 
the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  development  program  for  satralizumab  in  patients  with  NMO  and  NMOSD  includes  two 
ongoing  (at  the  clinical  cut-off  date)  global  Phase  III  pivotal  studies:  Study  BN40898  in  adult  and 
adolescent patients with satralizumab in addition to background IST and Study BN40900 in adult patients 
with satralizumab as a monotherapy. In addition, two Phase I studies have been conducted in Japan, 
one in healthy volunteers (SA-001JG) and one in RA patients (SA-105JG). 
GCP 
The Applicant claimed that the Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP.  
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

An  ELISA  was  validated  to  measure  satralizumab  concentrations  in  serum.  The  assay,  which  detects 
target-binding  competent  drug,  is  based  on  soluble  IL-6R  (sIL-6R)  to  capture  satralizumab  and  a 
polyclonal anti-satralizumab rabbit antibody, and a Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-
rabbit antibody conjugated for detection. 
Detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
The immunogenicity testing strategy for satralizumab followed a classical multitiered analytical approach, 
involving screening, confirmation for samples testing positive, titration assays and assays for detection 
of neutralising antibodies. A commercial assay to detect IgE was also employed (ImmunoCAP).  
Two  different  validated  electrochemiluminescence  immunoassays  (ECLIAs)  were  used  in  the  clinical 
studies to screen for anti-satralizumab antibodies in human serum samples. The ADA I assay was used 
in studies SA-001JP and SA-105JP. The assay was also used in Studies BN40898 and BN40900 until ADA 
assay II became  available. Data generated  with  ADA assay I in studies BN40898 and  BN40900 were 
used in the submission only if the data were not generated with ADA assay II. Selection criteria for the 
re-assay using ADA assay II were such that each ADA negative subject had several samples reanalysed. 
The ADA assay I consists of a sandwich-type bridging ECLIA with an additional competitive displacement 
step for the confirmation assay. Satralizumab is used for capture (biotinylated, capture on a streptavidin 
coated  plate)  and  detection  (ruthenylated),  after  pre-incubation  with  the  sample.  The  presence  of 
satralizumab in a sample considerably reduces the sensitivity of the method to levels that required the 
development of another assay for the NMO/NMOSD population.   
The  ADA  assay  II  and  multitiered  immunogenicity  strategy  was  identical  to  ADA  Assay  I,  with  an 
additional  acid-dissociation  step  prior  to  sample  incubation  with  biotinylated  and  ruthenylated 
satralizumab. The drug tolerance was improved with no interference up to 60 µg/mL satralizumab for 
ADA 100 ng/mL and up to 200 µg/mL satralizumab for ADA 500 ng/mL. 
Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to satralizumab in human serum were determined by a competitive ligand 
binding assay using an  electrochemiluminescence (ECL) readout. The neutralizing antibody method is 
based on pre-incubating ADA samples with a fixed quantity of ruthenylated satralizumab before adding 
the  solution  to  plates  coated  with  human  sIL-6R.  Unbound  ruthenylated  satralizumab  will  bind  to 
immobilized sIL-6R, whereas ruthenylated satralizumab complexed with neutralizing anti-satralizumab 
antibodies will not. The amount of ruthenylated satralizumab bound to sIL-6R is detected by ECL and 
evaluated against a pre-determined cut-point. Despite the implementation of an upfront acid dissociation 
step, satralizumab concentrations of > 1.0 µg/mL caused false negative assay results.  
The  IgE-antibodies  assay  is  based  on  the  commercially  available  ImmunoCAP  assay  system. 
Satralizumab  is  covalently  bound  to  a  cellulose  carrier,  which  is  contained  in  a  reaction  capsule 
(ImmunoCAP). The ImmunoCAPs react with any specific IgE antibody in the serum. After a wash step, 
detection  occurs  via  binding  of  a  β-D-galactosidase  labelled  human  anti-humanIgE  antibody  and 
fluorometric measurement. Reduced assay response was observed in presence of satralizumab and sIL-
6R. 
Detection of PD markers: IL-6, sIL-6R and Anti-AQP4 Antibodies  
A  commercial  sandwich  ELISA  assay  (Quantikine®  Human  IL-6  Immunoassay)  was  used  to  measure 
serum  concentrations  of  endogenous  IL-6.  An  immobilized  murine  monoclonal  antibody  specific  for 
human IL-6 was used for  capture  of  IL-6  and  detection occurred via an anti-IL-6  polyclonal antibody 
conjugated to peroxidase for reaction with a chromogenic substrate.  
A commercial sandwich ELISA assay (Quantikine® Human sIL-6R Immunoassay) was used to measure 
serum  concentrations of endogenous sIL-6R. An  immobilized murine  monoclonal antibody  specific for 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 37/132 
 
 
  
  
human  sIL-6R  was  used  for  capture  of  sIL-6R  and  detection  occurred  via  an  anti-IL-6R  polyclonal 
antibody conjugated to peroxidase for reaction with a chromogenic substrate.  
Analysis of AQP4‐IgG was done according to predefined procedures using a research assay kit which was 
qualified  fit  for-purpose.  The  AQP4AbELISA  “Cosmic”  II  (Cosmic  Corporation Co.,  Ltd.,  Japan)  uses  a 
bridging  format  with  immobilized  human  recombinant  AQP4  antigen  for  AQP4‐IgGcapture  and 
biotinylated  human  recombinant  AQP4  antigen  together  with  streptavidin  peroxidase  /  tetramethyl-
benzidine for photometric detection. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
A non-compartmental model and a population PK analysis were used.  
The  population  PK  analysis  was  conducted  via  nonlinear  mixed-effects  modelling  with  the  NONMEM 
(NONlinear Mixed Effects Modeling) software. Non-parametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were obtained for the parameters of the final model by generating 200 datasets from the original dataset 
through  random  sampling  with  replacement  using  the  individual  as  the  sampling  unit.  Model-based 
simulations  were  performed  by  a  combination  of  R  and  NONMEM  software.  The  simulation  R  scripts 
created the simulation datasets and started NONMEM; NONMEM performed the simulations; the same R 
scripts read the NONMEM output and prepared the simulation plots and tables.  
The satralizumab population PK analysis was conducted in two stages. In Stage 1 (Report No. 1093049), 
the  data  from  study  SA-001JP  (healthy  subjects)  were  combined  with  data  from  patients  with 
NMO/NMOSD  receiving  satralizumab  in  addition  to  baseline  IST  (BN40898)  (up  to  06  June  2018).  A 
covariate  analysis  was  performed  after  removing  data  from  RA  patients.  In  Stage  2  (Report  No. 
1094498), the data from the second Phase III study (BN40900) in patients receiving satralizumab as 
monotherapy (up to 12 October 2018) were combined with the Stage 1 dataset with additional PK data 
from the OLE of BN40898. Estimated parameters from both models were very similar. The data from 
this final dataset/model is described here. 
The final model was a 2-compartment model with a linear and a non-linear (Michaelis-Menten) clearance 
and first order absorption. The parameter estimates of the final model are presented in Table 3. 
 Bootstrap  parameter  estimates  and  CI  on  parameter  estimates  were  consistent  with  the  final  model 
estimates and asymptotic CI. When intra-subject variability (18%) was included in the model, it only led 
to a small change in the inter-individual variability (from 30% to 27%) and residual error (from 17.5 to 
14%), despite a drop of 600 in objective function (OFV). Analysis of the impact of co-medication on ADA 
was performed but no significant relationships were found.

At  lower  exposures,  the  non-linear  clearance  (VC∙Vmax/(Km+C)),  reflecting  target  mediated  drug 
disposition (TMDD),  predominated, accounting  for a  lesser  proportion of the  total clearance  at higher 
exposures, see Figure 1. At a concentration of 25.7 µg/mL, equal to the mean satralizumab concentration 
(over time and between patients) at steady-state, the two components of total clearance contributed 
approximately equally to elimination of satralizumab. Consequently, the effect of ADA on total clearance 
was approximately 20% and the effect of formulation was approximately 4%.

Based on the final model, individual concentration-time profiles and the corresponding PK parameters 
were simulated based on the individual subject parameters using the 120 mg every four weeks (Q4W) 
dosing regimen (Table 4). The time-independent effect of ADA on bioavailability was included while the 
time-dependent effect on linear clearance was not accounted for as it is not possible, using the model, 
to predict the appearance of ADAs.

The summaries of exposures stratified by covariate groups for patients with NMO/NMOSD are presented 
in Table 5 (also for those covariates that were not retained in the final model). Since many covariates 
were correlated with body weight (BW), summaries of body weight by covariate levels are also provided. 
The results were consistent with the predicted decrease of exposure in patients with higher BW. Steady-
state area under the concentration-time curve tau (AUCτ) for patients in the lowest BW category (39.3- 
57.3kg) were 40% higher than for patients in the middle BW category (57.3 - 75.0 kg). Patients in the 
highest BW category (75.0 - 151.0 kg) had 50% lower AUCτ compared to patients in the middle category.

Based  on  the  non-linear  clearance  parameters  as  estimated  from  the  population  pharmacokinetics 
(popPK)  model,  the  unobserved  IL-6  receptor  occupancy  (RO)  can  be  calculated.  Computed 
concentrations (C) were used to predict unobserved receptor occupancy and CLtotal as follows: 
RO=C/(Km+C); CLtotal =CL+VC∙Vmax/(C+Km), 
where KM,VC, and Vmax are Michaelis-Menten constant, volume of the central compartment, and 
maximum Michaelis-Menten elimination rate, respectively.

Individual  simulations of  RO  are  shown graphically (median  and 90% prediction  interval)  for  the two 
Phase  III  trials  (Figure  2).  While  the  median  RO  remained  high  throughout  the  dose  interval  in  both 
Phase III trials (>95%), the lower bound of the 90% CI was lower in study BN40900 relative to study 
BN40898, which is consistent with the lower exposure observed in this trial. RO was considered high in 
all subgroups, as defined by the Applicant.

using individual predictions of PK parameters.  
Absorption  
In  the  pop  PK  analysis,  satralizumab  SC  bioavailability  was  85.4%  (95%  CI:  75.2-95.6%).  The 
absorption rate constant was 0.251 /day (95% CI: 0.216 - 0.285).  
No data is available regarding the impact of the injection site on PK. Ctrough following administration in 
the abdomen and in the thigh was similar (Table 6) when taking into account differences in BW.

BN40900 
Comparability of the G1 and G2.1 processes was demonstrated by a thorough comparability program 
comprising  routine  analytical  and  extended  characterization  of  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the 
antibody  as  well  as  in  vitro  functional  assays.  As  comparability  was  demonstrated,  no  clinical 
comparability studies were done.

No food effect is expected, given the SC administration. 
Distribution 
Satralizumab  undergoes  biphasic  distribution.  For  a  60  kg  NMO/NMOSD  patient,  the  population  PK 
predicts a VC of 3.46 l (95% CI: 3.21 - 3.97), a VP of 2.07 l (95% CI: 1.78 - 2.59) and a Q of 0.336 l/day 
(95% CI: 0.261 - 0.443). 
Elimination 
Satralizumab  demonstrated  target  mediated  drug  disposition.  The  CLtotal  of  satralizumab  is 
concentration-dependent. Linear clearance is estimated to be 0.0601 l/day (95% CI: 0.0524 - 0.0695). 
At  therapeutic  exposure,  the  linear  CL  represents  approximately  50%  of  the  CLtotal.  The  associated 
terminal t1/2 is approximately 30 days (range 22-37 days) based on data pooled from the phase 3 studies. 
The  excretion of  satralizumab  has  not  been  directly  studied,  as  monoclonal  antibodies  are  principally 
cleared by catabolism.  
Dose proportionality  
Satralizumab PK was shown to be non-linear across the dose range of 30-240 mg SC. Faster elimination 
was observed at lower concentrations, consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. 
Time dependency & immunogenicity 
Time dependency in the PK has been evaluated in the popPK model and the results did not point towards 
a time dependency in the PK of satralizumab because the effect of ADAs generation on the bioavailability 
of the SC formulation were modelled as time independent.

In the two Phase III trials, lower exposures were observed in patients who developed ADAs. Patients 
who went on to develop ADAs generally had higher BW, lower exposure and lower bioavailability prior to 
developing ADAs. Observed differences in exposure between patients with and without detected ADAs 
were  the  result  of  a  combination  of  the  observed  BW  differences  between  patients  with  and  without 
detected  ADAs,  lower  satralizumab  bioavailability  (by  13%)  in  patients  with  detected  ADAs  (prior  to 
detection of ADA), and higher satralizumab linear clearance (by 45%) at times when ADA was detected. 
Given that linear and non-linear clearances were contributing approximately equally to CLtotal at steady 
state, the effect of ADA on total clearance  was approximately  20%. The  combined effects of  ADA  on 
bioavailability and linear clearance may lead to the approximately two-fold lower steady-state exposure 
in patients with detected ADAs compared to ADA-negative patients of the same BW. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 43/132 
 
 
  
  
For patients with detected ADAs, median RO at the end of the dosing intervals (trough) was about 95%, 
while the lowest RO was below 30%. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual  variability  (%CV)  was  described  in  the  pop  PK  model.  On  the  linear  clearance,  it 
amounted to 30%, and on the VC 17%. Intra-individual variability was not reported.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
PK in the target population is described by the pop PK model that also contains healthy subject data. PK 
parameters in NMO patients are summarized in Table 4.  
Special populations 
No dedicated intrinsic factors studies were conducted. However, factors, such as age, gender, BW, renal 
function, and ADA, were evaluated in the popPK analysis. 
As  anticipated  based  on  the  known  mechanisms  of  clearance  for  satralizumab  and  confirmed  by  the 
popPK analysis, the PK was not impacted in patients with mild renal impairment, nor by age, race or 
gender. 
Elimination  of  IgG  antibodies  such  as  satralizumab  is  thought  to  occur  via  proteolytic  metabolism  in 
endothelial cells (i.e., not cleared by hepatic metabolism). Therefore, no formal study on the effect of 
hepatic impairment on the PK of satralizumab has been conducted. 
BW was shown to be a significant covariate. Satralizumab exposure in the tertile of patients with the 
highest BW (i.e. BW >75 kg) was approximately 50% lower compared to those in the 2nd tertile. The 
Applicant considers that treatment benefit was comparable in all BW groups and that no dose adjustment 
is required.  
Satralizumab exposure (mean and range) and RO were similar in adolescents [13-17 years] and adults 
(Table 4) which is consistent with the observed similar BW of the adolescent patients and the adults, as 
well as the similar incidence of ADA in both populations. Once the BW effect is accounted for age has no 
significant effect on satralizumab PK. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Inflammation that results in increased IL-6 levels has been shown to inhibit the expression of CYP450 
isozymes and hence the metabolism of substrate concomitant medications. Satralizumab is designed to 
block IL-6R signalling (and hence normalize CYP levels), which has the potential to alter the metabolism 
of concomitant medications. 
Based  on  literature  data  for  tocilizumab,  sarilumab  and  sirukumab,  there  is  a  risk  of  interaction  at 
baseline levels of IL-6 in RA patients (50-80 pg/mL), with AUC ratio (AUCR) in the range of 0.43-0.61 
for the CYP3A4 substrate simvastatin and similar data for CYP2C9 and 2C19 substrates. 
Peripheral IL-6 values in NMOSD are lower than in systemic inflammatory diseases. Masuda et al (2018) 
report median values of 2.8 pg/mL based on 20 individuals with NMOSD. Uzawa et al (2010) report that 
even around the time of relapse, values in all but one of 31 NMOSD patients were found to be ≤ 4 pg/mL. 
In contrast, Barros et al, 2016 reported a median value in 20 NMOSD patients of 58.5 pg/mL at during 
remission, and a median ≤ 80 pg/mL during relapse. However, the Applicant noted that overall, caution 
is  warranted  when  comparing  absolute IL-6  values  between  studies  given  that  different  studies have 
used  different  platforms  and  matrices,  and  because  clinical  values  fall  in  the  low  pg/mL  range.  The 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 44/132 
 
 
  
  
NMOSD patients in the studies with satralizumab (and placebo) demonstrated lower IL-6 levels (1.57-
37.2 pg/mL), suggesting the risk of interaction is low. Nevertheless, a warning for co-administration with 
narrow therapeutic index substrates of CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 has been included in section 4.5. 
of the SmPC. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In NMO/NMOSD patients, median [5th and 95th percentile] PK parameters were as follows: Cmax 29.4 [10-
57.3] µg/mL , AUC 705 [199-1410] µg/mL/day, and Ctrough 18.3 [2.79 – 41.2].  
For the exposure safety analysis, concentrations at day 56 were used (Ctrough, Ctr56) as a surrogate for 
Cmax and AUC, as these were demonstrated to correlate.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Satralizumab binds specifically to membrane-bound and soluble IL-6R, but the PD data on it is relatively 
scarce. In comparison to tocilizumab, it was designed to have: (1) a longer plasma half-life; (2) a lower 
risk of immunogenicity, and (3) reduced effector mechanisms such as ADCC and CDC.  
IL-6 induces differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing cells, is involved in inflammatory response, 
induction  of  differentiation  and  proliferation  of  various  cells,  regulation  of  immune  response,  and 
increased  production  of  platelets.  On  the  basis  of  in  vitro  studies,  IL-6  promotes  differentiation  of 
inflammatory Th17 cells and plasmablasts, inducing the production of pathogenic antibodies and may 
also increase blood-brain barrier permeability.  
In NMOSD, elevated IL-6 levels have been described in the patients’  CSF and serum during relapses, 
and CSF IL-6 levels are correlated with disease severity of NMOSD patients. IL-6 promotes survival of 
plasmablasts and may enhance their AQP4‐IgG production. IL-6R blockade has inhibited the survival of 
plasmablasts in vitro. A few small open-label studies using IL-6R blockade have suggested an effect on 
relapse risk reduction in patients with NMO, and overall, it appears reasonable that satralizumab could 
have a role in treating NMOSD. 
Primary pharmacology 
The functional inhibitory activity of satralizumab was demonstrated using human plasmablasts, human 
T  cells,  and  human  fibroblast-like  synoviocytes,  while  human  myeloma  cells  were  used  to  test  ADCC 
toxicity  and  CDC.  Satralizumab  decreased  IL-6-induced  IgG1  production  by  human  plasmablasts, 
inhibited IL-6-induced proliferation of human peripheral T-cells and inhibit IL-6  induced production of 
monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1 (MCP-1)  and  VEGF  in  human  fibroblast-like  synoviocytes.  Using 
U266 cells, a human multiple myeloma cell  line  expressing hIL-6R and peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from healthy human donors, satralizumab was shown not to induce ADCC or CDC. 
The supporting Phase I studies, SA-001 JP in healthy subjects and SA-105JP in patients with RA provided 
the initial understanding of PK/PD/immunogenicity with a single ascending or multiple dosing. Results 
from  the  pivotal  studies  in  patients  with  NMO/NMOSD  represent  the  key  data  for  the  NMO/NMOSD 
indication, and they used a flat dosing regimen.  
The  main  PD  markers,  soluble  IL-6R  (sIL-6R)  and  IL-6  concentrations  were  determined  as  a  direct 
assessment  of  target  engagement.  Serum  sIL-6R  concentrations  were  measured  by  ELISA  using  a 
monoclonal mouse antibody against IL-6R for capture and a HRP labelled anti IL-6 polyclonal antibody 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 45/132 
 
 
  
  
for detection. This assay measures the bound soluble receptor bound as well as the free receptor. CRP, 
C3, C4, and total complement activity (CH50) were quantified as inflammation biomarkers. 
The PD markers IL-6 and sIL-6R have a direct link to the proposed mechanism, and CRP is synthesized 
by hepatocytes as a direct effect of IL-6 signalling in response to proinflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and 
sIL-6R  levels  show  marked,  consistent  and  dose-dependent  elevation  after  administration  of 
satralizumab in all studied populations. The levels do not seem to be elevated at baseline in NMO/NMOSD 
patients.  The  findings  are  not  at  variance  with  the  basic  hypothesis  of  IL  levels  rising  as  a  result  of 
receptor blockade by satralizumab, Also CRP levels show a marked and fairly consistent decrease after 
administration of satralizumab and is visible despite the high variability of the serum levels. This finding 
strongly  suggests  that  the  principal  cause  is  the  inhibitory  effect  on  hepatocytes  in  producing  acute-
phase proteins such as CRP (or indeed fibrinogen) rather than the proposed reduction of inflammation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The available secondary pharmacology data is limited. The data of the Phase I studies (healthy controls 
(Study SA-001JP) is incorporated in the above section. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Individual predicted trough concentrations at Week 8 (Day 56) following actual dosing history (Ctr56) 
were used as a measure of exposure. The individual exposure was predicted using the popPK model from 
Stage 1 for the BN40898 study and from Stage 2 for the BN40900 study. The low and high exposure 
groups  were  defined  by  the  exposure  being  below  or  equal  to,  and  above  median  of  the  exposure 
distribution  among  patients  administered  satralizumab.  The  median  exposure used  for  the  exposure-
response  analyses  was  22  µg/mL  and  12.6  µg/ml  for  BN40898  and  BN40900,  respectively,  and  16.8 
µg/ml for the pooled analysis.  
Exposure/safety 
Graphical  analyses  were  performed  for  the  relationship  between  satralizumab concentrations  and the  
occurrence of (severe) AE, moderate or severe AEs of infections and infestations, gastrointestinal AEs, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and main safety parameters ie neutrophil,  WBC, and platelet counts, 
bilirubin,  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  serum  albumin,  total 
protein,  total  cholesterol,  high  density  lipoprotein  (HDL)-cholesterol,  low  density  lipoprotein  LDL-
cholesterol, and triglycerides. 
The results of the graphical analyses were the following:  
− 
− 
− 
− 
Minor decrease of WBC counts and neutrophil counts were observed in the high exposure group 
while remaining in the normal range.  
Platelet counts were stable in the placebo group and slightly declined in the active arm patients, 
with no difference between exposure groups. 
Total bilirubin slightly increased but then remained stable and within the normal range in the 
high exposure group. 
ALT, AST, serum albumin, total protein, triglycerides, and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol did not 
show any consistent changes (either in absolute terms or change from baseline).  
Logistic regression models were implemented to assess correlation of the probability of AE occurrence  
with  exposure;  the  analysis  was  performed  separately  for  Ctr56  and  logarithm  of  Ctr56  as  exposure 
measures. To define  CI  for the logistic regression function, 1000 bootstrap  samples were  drawn with 
replacement from the analysis population and the logistic regression were fitted to each of these samples. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 46/132 
 
 
  
  
For  each  Ctr56  value,  90%  CI  was  defined  as  the  5th  and  95th  percentiles  of  the  model  predictions 
among  1000  bootstrap  datasets.  There  were  very  few  AEs  of  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia; 
therefore,  comparisons  of  distributions  of  exposures  for  different  grades  of  events  could  not  be 
performed. Overall, residual error was high to very high for these models (86 to 8496%), thus strongly 
undermining the value of these analyses. 
The summary of the occurrence of the  AE for all patients from the BN40900 study, including placebo 
patients,  is  presented  in  Table  8.  The  logistic  regression  models  (placebo  excluded)  indicated  no 
significant relationships between exposure and probabilities of any AE.

The predicted placebo-adjusted change from baseline in Corrected QT interval by Fredericia (ΔΔQTcF) 
concentration  relationship  and  its  upper  one-sided  95%  CI  was  constructed  by  simulation  using  a 
bootstrap procedure and was presented graphically together with the observed values. Specifically, 1000 
datasets were created from an original dataset by random sampling with replacement using individual 
subject as a sample unit. The model was fitted to each of the created datasets, and estimated parameters 
were  used  to  compute  the  predicted  ΔΔQTcF  for  the  range  of  concentrations  spanning  all  observed 
concentrations.  At  each  concentration  value,  5th,  50th  and  95th  percentiles  of  the  predictions  were 
computed and presented graphically. The  predicted mean and upper one-sided 95%  CI  for the mean 
ΔΔQTcF  at  satralizumab  Cmax  were  computed  at  the  mean  predicted  steady-state  satralizumab  Cmax 
following 120mg Q4W dosing. A correction for circadian variation was not feasible due to the variability 
in sampling timepoints.  
In the monotherapy study BN40900, at mean predicted Cmax value of 26.5 µg/mL, predicted ΔΔQTcF was 
estimated at 8.31 msec (90%CI: 6.35 - 10.89 msec), with the upper bound of the CI exceeded 10msec 
safety threshold used to evaluate QTc prolongation and risk of Torsades de Pointes. 
For pooled data, at mean predicted Cmax value of 31.5 µg/mL, predicted ΔΔQTcF was estimated at 6.32 
msec (90%CI: 4.48 - 8.76 msec), with the upper bound of the CI below the 10 msec safety threshold. 
Exposure/pharmacodynamics 
Graphical analyses were performed for the relationship between satralizumab concentrations and CRP, 
fibrinogen, C3, C4, CH50, IL-6, sIL-6R, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain score, Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue score and ADA status.  
Following treatment start, median levels of CRP, fibrinogen, and complement components C3, C4, and 
CH50  declined  quickly  in  the  active  treatment  arm  and  then  stayed  approximately  constant  with  no 
appreciable differences between median values in the two exposure groups. The variability was slightly 
lower in the high exposure group for all parameters. There were no changes in median values over time 
in the placebo group.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 47/132 
 
 
  
  
 
 
There were no consistent changes in FACIT fatigue score or VAS pain score in any of the 3 exposure 
groups. 
There  were  no  appreciable  differences  in  the  median  values  of  CRP,  fibrinogen,  and  complement 
components  C3,  C4,  and  CH50  between  patients  with  and  without  detected  ADAs  but  inter-subject 
variability  was  higher  in  patients  with  detected  ADAs.  The  median  levels  of  IL-6  and  sIL-6R  were 
approximately the same in patients with and without detected ADAs, but inter-subject variability was 
higher in patients with detected ADAs. There were no consistent changes in FACIT fatigue and VAS scale 
scores between the ADA groups. 
Exposure/efficacy analysis of time to first relapse (Cox proportional hazards model) 
Exposure-efficacy analysis was performed for each of the two Phase III studies separately for all time to 
first relapse (TFR) measures. Protocol-defined relapse (PDR) (TFR1) was the primary measure. All other 
TFR measures in including clinical relapse (TFR2), treated clinical relapse (TFR3), treated clinical relapse 
optic  neuritis  (TFR4),  protocol-defined  relapse  based  on  CEC  adjudication  (TFR5),  protocol-defined 
relapse based on Expanded disability status scale (EDSS)/Functional System Score (FSS) increase (TFR6) 
were used for the sensitivity analysis. 
The  exposure-TFR  relationship  was  investigated  through  semi-parametric  Cox  proportional  hazard 
analysis (CPH). The analysis was performed in two ways: (i) including only patients in the active arm, 
and (ii) also including the placebo patients. Base CPH models were established first, followed by covariate 
CPH modelling aimed to assess the effects of covariates on the exposure-response relationship in order 
to  remove  confounding  effects  of  the  prognostic  factors.  No  covariate  was  retained  in  the  models. 
Exposure (day 56, individually predicted) and observed time to TFR1 (relapses occurring after day 56) 
in studies BN40898 and BN40900 are shown in Figure 3 for all NMOSD patients irrespectively of AQP4-
IgG serostatus and in Figure 4 for only AQP4-IgG positive patients.  
For all TFR measures (TFR1 -TFR6) time to relapse appeared to correlate with satralizumab exposure. 
Placebo  patients  and  patients  in  the  low  exposure  group  had  similar  time  to  the  first  relapse,  while 
patients in the high exposure group had longer relapse-free survival. Parameters were estimated with 
high  uncertainty  (>50%)  in  all  models.  The  visual  predictive  check  simulations  using  the  CPH  model 
show that there is an overlap between the predictions for the low and high exposure groups as well as 
between the predictions for the low exposure group and the placebo group. All the results in AQP4-IgG 
positive  patients,  by  study  and  with  the  pooled  dataset,  indicate  that  placebo-treated  patients  have 
shorter time to first relapse when compared to satralizumab-treated patients.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methods 
Quantification of satralizumab 
The  assay  quantified  only  target  binding  competent  drug,  which  is  also  referred  to  as  free  drug. 
Interferences by non-neutralizing ADAs should in principle not lead to interferences. Against theoretical 
expectations,  both  IL-6  and  IL-6R  did  not  lead  to  significant  interferences  at  physiologically  relevant 
concentrations.  Upon  request,  the  Applicant  provided  analysis  certificates  for  critical  reagents  and 
missing bioanalysis reports and parallelism was demonstrated in study samples from NMO patients.  
Overall, the methods is adequately validated for the intended purpose.  
Detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
During the procedure, the Applicant clarified the process of analysis and re-analysis using ADA assay 
II. Even if not all samples were re-analysed, no significant differences in the ADA status were noted in 
a selection of each subjects samples analysed with ADA assay II. Therefore, the re-analysis strategy 
was considered acceptable. 
Stability was only investigated in ADA assay I. Upon request, the Applicant clarified that stability data 
for ADA assay I was generated to support the use of quality control samples stored for up to one month 
under  frozen  condition  in  the  ADA  assay  to  monitor  the  assay  performance.  The  assessment  did  not 
intend to evaluate the stability of real ADA samples. The stability of antibodies in low pH conditions for 
a  short  period  of  time  is  considered  well  accepted,  being  widely  utilized  in  protein  purification  and 
production steps. These arguments were considered acceptable.  
ADA I

In RA patients, false positive results may be obtained due to the presence of auto antibodies. The drug 
tolerance in these patients is unknown, leading to uncertainty about the net effect of false positive and 
false negative results. However, since the RA data is only supportive, the issue was not pursued. 
Drug tolerance issues were identified, where essentially the 240 mg dose group (healthy subjects) would 
obtain  false  negative  results,  and  all  NMO  patients.  For  them  the  development  of  ADA  assay  II  was 
necessary (see below). For the remaining dose groups in healthy subjects, the assay is adequate for the 
detections of ADAs.  
Report  1093535  refers  to  two  different  sets  of  reagents  used  in  either  the  healthy  subjects  and  RA 
patients or the NMO/NMOSD patients. It was unclear what the differences were between these sets of 
reagents and what implications this could have on the assay readout. It seemed that the same set that 
was used in the method validation 1093534 and for the healthy subjects and RA patients. Lot numbers 
of these reagents were however not the same in the provided reports, and analysis certificates or cross-
validation reports for  the change of critical reagents  were  not provided. Furthermore, reports of ADA 
analysis  were  referred  to  but  were  not  provided  for  studies  SA-001JP  and  SA-105JP  (PRD12-023), 
therefore it was also unclear which of the different normalization factors and cutpoints were used, since 
the method for determining the disease specific normalization factor and cut point changed during the 
validation  of  the  method.  In  their  response,  the  Applicant  provided  the  reports  and  acceptable 
explanations regarding the use of the different sets of reagents and cutpoints.  
ADA II 
The implementation of an acid dissociation step improved drug tolerance for the use in the NMO/NMOSD 
population  with  tolerance  up  to  20  µg/mL  satralizumab  for  ADA  100  ng/mL  and  up  to  200  µg/mL 
satralizumab  for  ADA  500  ng/mL.  In  those  individuals  with  satralizumab  concentrations  above  the 
median, false negative results may be measured for ADA levels below 500 ng/mL (Cmax,ss of 30 µg/mL 
and Ctrough,ss of 19 µg/mL at 120mg Q4W in adults; Q95 Cmax,ss of 63 µg/mL, < 18 years and Q95 Ctrough,ss 
of 45 µg/mL, < 18 years, similar Q95 in adults). The drug tolerance was further improved, so that the 
risk of false negative results was strongly reduced.  
NAb 
The neutralizing antibody assay suffers from drug tolerance issue from 1 µg/mL (despite the use of an 
acid dissociation step in VR 1093791), which represents most of the clinical samples. The impact of ADAs 
on PD is unknown due to the inadequacy of the NAb assay. As other assay formats  were expected to 
have similar drug tolerance  issues, a new  assay  was  not requested.  The  Applicant  considers that  the 
impact of ADAs on the PD of satralizumab is low, as no consistent differences in PD parameters other 
than sIL-6R were observed. This is acceptable, however the lower target engagement in ADA positive 
patients should be treated as a sign of potential neutralisation. 
IgE 
The validation of the IgE ImmunoCAP assay is basic, but is sufficient for the intended purpose, as it was 
used in Study SA-105JP only and is not required per guideline.  
Detection of PD markers: IL-6, sIL-6R and Anti-AQP4 Antibodies  
IL-6 
This assay provides a sensitive, and specific method to quantify human IL-6 levels and is adequate for 
the intended purpose. No significant interference with satralizumab or sIL-6R was observed at clinically 
relevant concentrations, therefore the measured concentration can be viewed as the total concentration. 
sIL-6R 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 51/132 
 
 
  
  
No significant interference with IL-6 at clinically relevant levels was observed. A significant interference 
by satralizumab was circumvented by adding an excess of satralizumab to all samples in the phase III 
studies. It is unclear whether the excess of satralizumab was used in the phase I studies as no analysis 
report was provided. No clarification was requested to the Applicant. 
This assay provides a sensitive, and specific method to quantify human sIL-6R levels and is adequate 
for the intended purpose. 
Anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies (AQP4Ab) 
The assay is considered fit for purpose. No significant interferences were observed. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Although initially the  PK  of satralizumab  was to be studied using data from  four clinical trials (one in 
healthy volunteers (Study SA-001JP), another one in patients with RA (Study SA-015JP) , and two in the 
target population (Study BN40898 and Study BN40900) , i.e. patients with NMO or NMOSD) finally data 
from  patients with  RA  were excluded because  their  data were  different  from  the other two groups of 
participants and considering that these patients were out of the scope of the intended drug development. 
Data from  study SA-105JP are  therefore excluded  from  the  final PopPK models but this data had  not 
been  excluded  at  the  timepoint  of  the  covariate  analysis.  The  exclusion  is  acceptable,  as  target 
differences can be expected, and the Applicant clarified that the covariate analysis had been performed 
after the exclusion of the RA study data. 
The final population PK model shows that  the  disposition of satralizumab can be described by a two-
compartment model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination, and that it depends on body 
weight,  ADAs  development,  formulation  (i.e.  formulation  for  Phase  I-III  or  market  formulation)  and 
disease status (Healthy volunteers vs patients with NMO/NMOSD). Considering that linear clearance and 
volume  parameters  increased  with  weight,  it  is  anticipated  that  exposure  of  satralizumab  in  females 
should be higher than in males. The imbalances in favour of female population (>80% of the recruited 
patients) provide a sufficiently sized safety database for the characterisation of the female safety profile. 
In  addition,  the  female  population  included  individuals  within  a  range  of  39.4-151  kg.  The  increased 
exposure according BW does not seem to have relevant impact on the safety profile.  
The Applicant was requested to investigate intra-individual variability before the covariate analysis. It is 
agreed that the estimate of inter-occasion variability (IOV) is small (18%), however with a significant 
drop  in  OFV,  it  should  have  been  taken  into  the  model.  Goodness  of  fit  graphs  show  that  higher 
concentrations  were  better  described  when  IOV  was  included  in  the  model.  Since  goodness  of  fit  is 
nevertheless  acceptable  with  the  old  model,  and  the  residual  error  is  not  very  different,  it  could  be 
accepted that the old model was used. 
Covariate analysis was performed only for the formulation in the stage 2 model and the covariate analysis 
of the stage 1 model was performed when data from RA patients were still included. Since the PK in RA 
patients was shown to be different, this raises concerns regarding the adequacy of the covariate analysis 
in the target population. The Applicant performed a new covariate analysis for the following covariates 
on  CL  and/or  F1:  Study,  co-medication  at  baseline  (Azathioprine,  Mycophenolate  Mofetil  and  oral 
corticosteroids),  oral  corticosteroids  rescue  therapy,  IV  corticosteroids  rescue  therapy.  None  of  the 
covariates had a significant effect, therefore the model was not updated. Mechanistically, an effect of 
the  co-medication  would have  been  expected  on  ADAs  and  thereby  on  CL,  the  data however  did  not 
show this. It is therefore acceptable not to update the model at this time.  
The pop PK report containing the new analyses has been provided. 
The  Applicant  considers  that  the  difference  in  PK  observed  between  healthy  subjects  and  the  target 
population is not due to co-medications. It is agreed that the different co-medications were not significant 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 52/132 
 
 
  
  
covariates in this small dataset. A trend in ETA for ADA effect on CL might indicate that ADAs may have 
a smaller impact on CL in individuals who are treated with oral corticosteroids. This should be considered 
in future applications to other populations.  
In order to cast light on which subgroups may show  a lack of target engagement, the  Applicant was 
asked to provide RO graphs for the following subgroups:  BW in bins of 10 kg, ADA status, AQP4-IgG 
serology, co-medication and any other covariate that may be significant after the new covariate analysis. 
The  requested  RO  graphs  were  provided.  It  was  agreed  that  in  the  presented  analysis,  RO  group  in 
over/under the median is less informative than the exposure. The presented analysis was considered too 
undifferentiated to be useful. The Applicant considered all predicted RO levels high and it was therefore 
not possible to define a target RO on the basis of the available data. It was not agreed that RO can be 
considered as high in all subgroups. In the plots of exposure or RO by  BW or BW and ADAs, patients 
over 100 kg seem at risk of low exposure and low RO both for their average and trough concentration 
and RO.  
While no differences can be seen between the RO graphs for AQP4 antibody status, obvious differences 
are visible when the patients are stratified by  ADA status, bodyweight and study. It is noted that the 
Applicant supplied RO graphs per study instead of the requested graphs per co-medication type. Since 
different co-medications were not significant covariates in the earlier analyses, this could be accepted. 
While the median predicted RO was high in all subgroups, the 5th percentile was significantly lower in 
the third BW tertile (>75kg), in ADA positive patients, and in patients in study BN4090 (monotherapy). 
It would be expected that these lower levels of RO would be correlated with a lower efficacy.  
The Applicant notes that BW is the strongest determinant of exposure (which is agreed with), however 
without suggesting a dose  adjustment according  to  weight. The  Applicant  provided  efficacy data  in  5 
weight bins and considered that a similar level of efficacy is seen in each bin, irrespective of the exposure 
and predicted RO level. A larger variability in response is seen in the BW group > 90 kg. Exposure and 
RO may still be acceptable at 90 kg, but not over 100 kg, which results in skewed data when binning > 
90 kg. It is expected that the value of 1 for the hazard of PDR would not be included in the CI if only 
patients  >  100  kg  were  looked  at.  The  Applicant  then  individually  reviewed  the  patients  with  low 
predicted RO, in order to better understand whether these patients were at a  greater risk of protocol-
defined relapse (PDR). The Applicant considers that no obvious difference was seen in these patients. It 
was noted that the calculated RO presented were significantly higher than the predicted RO at trough. 
The Applicant clarified the discrepancy between predicted and calculated RO, where one plot showed RO 
at trough of cycle 13, while the table presented average RO trough over the treatment period. RO values 
are  found  less  reliable  when  close  to  Km  (Michaelis  constant),  due  to  the  steepness  of  the  curve. 
Therefore, caution is warranted in drawing conclusions from the RO analysis, which is considered to only 
have a minor role in this application.  
Overall, it seems that predicted RO has no obvious correlation with efficacy, which is surprising. 
Absorption, Distribution and Elimination  
SC bioavailability was high as determined in the popPK model. It is recommended to inject satralizumab 
in  the  abdomen  or  the  thigh  and  rotate  between  injection  sites  (section  4.2  of  the  SmPC).  Ctrough 
concentrations stratified by injection site support the lack of influence of the injection site for the thigh 
and  the  abdomen.  Since  analytical  comparability  was  demonstrated,  it  is  acceptable  that  no  clinical 
comparability studies were performed. 
The distribution of satralizumab is in the expected range for a humanized monoclonal antibody. 
The CL and t1/2 are in the expected range for a humanized monoclonal antibody. The lack of excretion 
and biotransformation studies was acceptable given the nature of the test item. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 53/132 
 
 
  
  
Dose proportionality 
Satralizumab PK was shown to be non-linear, which is consistent with target-mediated drug 
disposition. 
Time dependency & immunogenicity 
Over 50% of satralizumab subjects were ADA positive in the single ascending dose study, except in the 
SC 240 mg group with 17%. Given the selected timepoints, no interference by satralizumab on the ADA 
assay readout was expected, except for the 240 mg group, who may have false negative results. 
The  RA  patients  receiving  multiple  doses  of  satralizumab  (and  allowed  concomitant  immunotherapy) 
showed only 6% ADA positive results. As the ADA assay did not define a drug tolerance in this population, 
it is unclear whether the ADA positive rate may be underestimated. The concomitant immunotherapy 
may also decrease the ADA positive rate. 
Considering the OLE periods in NMO/NMOSD studies, 52% patients had at least one ADA positive sample 
in study BN40898, with concomitant corticosteroid therapy. In the monotherapy study BN40900, 73% 
patients had at least one ADA positive sample. 
The ADA positive patients are at risk of higher satralizumab linear clearance (by 45%) at times when 
ADA are positive; and at risk of a lack of target engagement with the lowest RO being below 30% in the 
ADA positive group. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter- and intra-individual variability were relatively low.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The description of PK in target population is based on the population PK model. Disease is a significant 
covariate on the CL, according to the covariate analysis.  
Special populations 
No dedicated intrinsic factors studies were conducted. The intrinsic factors were evaluated in the popPK 
analysis. This was considered adequate. 
The  PK  was  similar  in  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment  and  normal  renal  function,  once  BW  was 
accounted  for.  The  same  was  true  for  race  or  gender.  Liver  insufficiency  is  not  expected  to  have  an 
impact  on  the  disposition  of  satralizumab,  however  it  is  excluded  in  the  SmPC  since  no  subject  with 
reduced liver function were included in the clinical studies.  
The highest BW tertile (> 75kg) shows a lower exposure and  RO. This was however not correlated to 
lower efficacy in NMOSD patients (see above), therefore no dose adjustment is warranted based on the 
current dataset. If satralizumab was to be used in other indications, the patients > 100 kg may benefit 
from a dose adjustment. 
The  Applicant  also  considered  BW  to  be  a  factor  in  the  probability  of  developing  ADAs,  which  was 
considered  speculative  and  was  removed  from  the  SmPC.  Following  the  Applicant’s  hypothesis  that 
immune tolerance may be induced by high exposure, the insufficient dose in the patients with higher BW 
may be the cause of their higher incidence of ADAs, which in turn may affect the PK of satralizumab. 
The PK of satralizumab in children (i.e. adolescents from 13 to 17 years) was evaluated during the popPK 
models development since in Study BN40898 patients from 13 to less than 18 years were included. The 
exposure predicted for children of this age range is similar to that predicted in adults. With the exception 
of age distribution, all other baseline characteristics were similar between adults and adolescent subjects. 
It was agreed that no specific dose adjustment is necessary for adolescent patients.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 54/132 
 
 
  
  
The studies cover a BW range 39.4-151 kg, which is higher than the median weight at age 12. A low BW 
12 year old patient may therefore have an exposure that is higher than what is covered by the current 
safety dataset. The CHMP agrees on the Applicant´s proposal to the following information in section 4.2 
of the SmPC “The posology in adolescent patients ≥12 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg and adult 
patients is the same (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). The safety and efficacy of satralizumab in children with 
body  weight  <  40  kg  have  not  yet  been  established.  No  data  are  available.”  No  dose  adjustment  is 
required  for  patients  over  65  years  of  age,  which  is  expected  for  antibodies  that  are  degraded  by 
proteolysis, which is age-independent.  
Interactions 
IL-6 mediated disease-drug interaction were studied using the SimCYP platform. However, the platform 
could not be considered qualified for the intended use and it was agreed that the preferred approach to 
describe  IL-6  mediated  interactions  would  be  to  base  the  SmPC  text  on  available  clinical  data  from 
blockade of IL-6 signalling. Additionally, mean baseline IL-6 levels were very modestly elevated in the 
clinical studies submitted and concerns were raised that the patient population in the study may not be 
representative for the population that may be treated clinically. Therefore, the Applicant was requested 
to justify which IL-6 concentration is representative for the NMO/NMOSD population that will be treated. 
In their response, the Applicant provided data on IL-6 levels and their effect on other medicinal products, 
as requested. The Applicant also presented literature data for the range of IL-6 concentrations that have 
been observed in NMOSD patients at different stages of their disease. The NMOSD patients in the studies 
with  satralizumab  (and  placebo)  demonstrated  lower  IL-6  levels  than  what  was  reported  in  certain 
literature sources. Nevertheless, the Applicant agreed to include a warning for co-administration  with 
narrow therapeutic index substrates of CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 in section 4.5 of the SmPC, which 
was endorsed.  
The overall PK interaction potential of satralizumab is considered low since satralizumab is an IgG. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The use of day 56 concentrations is acceptable, since steady state is reached at that timepoint.  Upon 
request, the Applicant justified the use of Ctrough instead of Cmax or AUC. The Applicant´s selection was 
considered acceptable since Ctrough  correlated with both Cmax and AUC, in particular since sampling was 
not sufficient to determine Cmax accurately.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The study of the relationships between exposure and response (safety, efficacy or PD markers), patients 
were divided in two groups for the graphical analysis: low or high exposure depending on whether they 
had Concentration at day 56 lower or higher than the mean of the patients.  
Exposure/safety 
It was not possible to assess the performance of the exposure /safety model as no uncertainty estimates 
were available. Upon request, the Applicant presented RSE for the exposure/safety analyses. The RSE 
was  very  high  in  the  logistic  regression  models,  which  may  be  due  to  the  size  of  the  dataset.  The 
conclusions  from  the  graphical  analysis,  which  do  not  demonstrate  significant  exposure/safety 
relationships, are considered more reliable.  
No  significant  relationships  between  exposure  and  probabilities  of  any  adverse  events  (AEs)  were 
observed, with the exception of the exposure QT analysis. Regarding the significance of this finding, see 
clinical safety.   
Exposure/pharmacodynamics 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 55/132 
 
 
  
  
The graphical exposure/pharmacodynamics analyses demonstrated a rapid response for CRP, fibrinogen, 
and complement components C3, C4, and CH50 with no appreciable differences between median values 
in the two exposure groups. 
For markers of target engagement, sIL-6R and IL-6, the variability was considerably larger in the low 
exposure group than the high exposure group when looking at values over time and change from baseline 
for IL-6 and especially when looking at sIL-6R. This tendency increased in ADA positive patients. Overall, 
this indicated low target engagement at lower exposures. At some level and duration, this might increase 
the risk of a relapse, however data currently do not support this (see discussion on RO). The Applicant 
was  requested to explain why there is more  variability  in  sIL6-R and the other  PD variables with the 
lower  exposure  and  what impact  this  variability  can  be  expected  to  have  on  OR  and  on  time  to  first 
relapse. The Applicant clarified that sIL-6R is a marker of target engagement, and therefore reflects RO, 
rather than  impacting it. This  greater  variability  in the  low  exposure  group may  indicate  lower  RO  in 
some individuals but high levels of RO were achieved in almost all patients. It is unlikely that the larger 
variability observed for PD markers in the low exposure group is indicative of a lack of overall  clinical 
response in this group. 
Exposure/efficacy analysis of time to first relapse (Cox proportional hazards model) 
AQP4-IgG positive and negative patients 
During the procedure, the Applicant justified that Day 56 was selected as the landmark time to limit the 
number  of  excluded  events  from  the  analysis  while  being  able  to  use  an  exposure  measure  which  is 
representative of the overall treatment period. The justification provided by the Applicant was agreed.  
BIC (Bayesian information criterion) indicated that no covariate was significant. However, the BIC for 
TFR1 did not show differences between the treated and the placebo groups, indicating that CPH modelling 
may not be adequate to describe the data. The description of the time course is generally poor and other 
(hazard) functions should be considered. The  Applicant did not update the exposure/response model. 
The  Applicant  claims  that  the  hazard  function  was  adequate,  despite  very  large  residual  error.  The 
Applicant  did  not  discuss  what  alternative  hazard  functions  were  investigated.  It  is  understood  that 
continuous exposure was included in the model, however the Applicant did not present the results per 
exposure  quartiles  as  requested,  and  instead  presented  two  group  (over  and  under  the  median),  as 
previously. The requested covariates were looked at, however, as in other analyses, studies were used 
instead of separating per type of co-medication. 
In line with the discussion on RO, since RO differences did not seem to correlate with efficacy, it was not 
expected  to  observe  differences  in  the  exposure/response  relationship  either.  The  Applicant  did  not 
discuss the impact of the co-medication on both the TRF1 and the exposure. The pooled analysis was 
considered exploratory, which was acceptable. It was therefore the individual analysis of each study that 
was considered relevant in terms of exposure response, considering that the population and treatment 
of both phase III studies were different. It should be noted that the provided graphs were not stratified 
for AQP4 serology, as requested.  
The Applicant concludes that differences in efficacy could not be explained by the exposure. It was agreed 
that  the  population  PK  modelling  approach  and  the  exposure/response  modelling  could  not  help 
identifying  which  subgroups  may  suffer  from  a  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  NMOSD  patient  population.  If 
satralizumab  was  to  be  used  in  other  indications,  the  patients  >  100  kg  may  benefit  from  a  dose 
adjustment.   
Since  the  model  was  not  considered  adequate  (uncertainty  >  50%),  conclusions  on  the 
exposure/response  relationship  cannot  be  drawn  from  the  predicted  data.  Observed  data  show  that 
patients  in  the  low  exposure  group  had  an  intermediate  relapse-free  survival  compared  to  the  high 
exposure group and placebo group. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 56/132 
 
 
  
  
AQP4-IgG positive patients 
The indication for satralizumab has been restricted to AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD patients, therefore 
a new exposure/efficacy analysis was provided for only AQP4-IgG seropositive patients. A new analysis 
with a new definition of event, as the sum of the previously defined event and the events of use of rescue 
medication was requested but not provided. This analysis was not requested again.  
As previously, pooled analyses  are  considered  only exploratory, as the co-medication study  BN40898 
may  have  an  effect  on  the  time  to  relapse  and  the  population  in  the  studies  are  not  comparable. 
Therefore, the individual E/R analyses per study should be considered.  
The  dataset  is  small;  thus  a  selection  bias  may  confound  the  covariate  analysis.  Therefore  a  model 
without covariate as used here is appropriate. Overall, the number of events, and the number of patients 
is small, leading to high parameter uncertainty, thus preventing to reach conclusions on an exposure 
efficacy  relationship,  in  particular  since  all  patients  were  given  the  same  dose.  Any  result  should  be 
interpreted with caution. The analysis however indicates that satralizumab seems to have an effect on 
TFR1 when compared to placebo.  
The role of AQP4-IgG antibodies in the pathophysiology of NMOSD is still not definitely determined. As 
an extension to the exposure efficacy question, the Applicant was asked to evaluate associations between 
satralizumab  concentrations,  RO,  and  relapses  with  AQP-4  Ab  titers.  However,  limitations  from  the 
analytical methods (ELISA limits of quantification and cell-based assay variability) prevent from providing 
the information required and this issue was not further pursued. 
SmPC 
The SmPC adequately describes the PK characteristics of satralizumab.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology was supported by two Phase III trials along with additional data from Phase I 
studies. The clinical pharmacology of satralizumab was considered sufficiently described.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Satralizumab dose finding was performed in two studies, including one Phase 1 single ascending dose 
study in Caucasian and Japanese healthy volunteers (SA-001JP) and one Phase 1b multiple dose study 
in Japanese RA patients (SA-105JP). PD endpoints were used (membrane-bound-IL-6R and soluble IL-
6R).  
In healthy subjects (SA-001JP), placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind (DB), inter-individual, SC 
dose escalation (up to 240 mg SC) as well as open label single IV administration (up to 120 mg IV) were 
studied. In total, 72 subjects were exposed to satralizumab and 12 to placebo (mean age: 23.3 to 25.3 
years, mean BW 60.2 to 61.5 kg, mean body mass index (BMI) 20.8 to 21.3 kg/m2).  
Serum  sIL-6R  elevated  in  a  dose  dependent  manner  and  dose  levels  at  120  and  240  mg  showed 
comparable peak levels of sIL-6R. The duration for which sIL-6Rs saturation was observed, showed a 
dose-dependent prolongation. At dose levels of 120 and 240 mg, sIL-6R saturation was sustained for 
more  than  28  days  at  peak  level.  Therefore,  the  dose  levels  over  120  mg/body  were  considered 
appropriate for a Q4W administration interval. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two pivotal Phase III studies BN40898 and BN40900 were conducted:  
• 
• 
Study BN40898 is a multicenter, DB, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
satralizumab as an add-on to baseline IST in adult and adolescent (12 to 17-year-old) patients.  
Study BN40900 is a multicenter, DB, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
satralizumab as monotherapy in adult patients. 
Study BN40898 and study BN40900 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 58/132 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Methods 
Study  BN40898  was  an  add-on  study  in  which  patients  were  required  to  be  receiving  baseline  IST 
treatment  at  a  stable dose  as  monotherapy  for  at  least  8  weeks  prior  to  baseline  and  during  the DB 
period. Conversely, the monotherapy study BN40900 enrolled patients who had either discontinued or 
had not previously received treatment for NMOSD; these treatments were prohibited from baseline to 
the end of the study.  
In both studies, patients who experienced a PDR during the DB period or completed the DB period could 
enter the OLE period. In Study BN40898, patients who experienced a clinical relapse that did not meet 
the definition of a PDR but was treated with rescue therapy could also enter the OLE; in Study BN40900 
these patients had to remain in the DB period. 
Patients who experienced a clinical relapse and did not enter the OLE were asked to continue in the study 
in the follow-up phase for 24 weeks from the last dose of study treatment.

Treatments 
In the pivotal studies, the patients received an SC injection of satralizumab 120 mg or placebo at Weeks 
0, 2 and 4, and Q4W thereafter during the double-blind period. In the OLE, all patients received open-
label treatment with satralizumab at a dose of 120 mg SC at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 and Q4W thereafter. In 
Study BN40898, patients who experienced a clinical relapse that did not meet the definition of a PDR but 
was  treated  with  rescue  therapy  could  also  enter  the  OLE;  in  Study  BN40900  these  patients  had  to 
remain in the DB period.  
Rescue therapy for clinical relapse was given by the discretion of the investigator and included pulse IV 
corticosteroids,  IV  immunoglobulin  (IVIG),  and/or  apheresis  (including  plasma  exchange  and 
plasmapheresis)  in  both  studies  while  oral  corticosteroids  for  tapering  was  also  permitted  in  study 
BN40900. 
Objectives 
The objectives of studies BN40898 and BN40900 were 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of satralizumab (add-on therapy; BN40898) (monotherapy; BN40900) 
compared with placebo in patients with NMO and NMOSD.  
• 
To  evaluate  the  safety  (add-on  therapy;  BN40898)  (monotherapy;  BN40900)  compared  with 
placebo in patients with NMO and NMOSD 
• 
• 
To examine the PD and PK of satralizumab. 
To examine the immunogenicity of satralizumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population for each individual study. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 61/132 
 
 
  
  
There are currently no validated endpoints to evaluate the efficacy of agents for the treatment of NMO 
or NMOSD. Because substantial disability can result from any given relapse and in order to reduce the 
potential risk associated with use of placebo, a time to-event outcome (i.e. TFR) instead of annualized 
relapse rate (ARR) was chosen as the primary efficacy measure in studies BN40898 and BN40900. TFR 
is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first occurrence of relapse, where the 
time point of relapse onset is defined as the time at which the patient experiences any new or worsening 
neurological NMO/NMOSD symptoms representing clinical relapse. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of TFR was based on PDRs to be adjudicated by an independent central 
Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) who reviewed all cases of relapse and evaluated each to see if it met 
the  criteria  for  a  PDR.  Moreover,  only  those  relapses  with  EDSS/FSS  assessment  conducted  by  the 
examining investigator within 7 days after the patient reported the event to the site were included in the 
primary analysis. 
At the GCP inspection, critical issues were found concerning a weak process for segregation of examining 
and treating investigators at clinical sites and various steps related to the relapse assessment process. 
In study BN40898, patients were censored if given with rescue treatment or if there was a change in 
background IST therapy.  
Protocol defined relapse was defined as: 
The occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms  attributable to NMO or NMOSD persisting 
for >24 hours and not attributable to confounding clinical factors (e.g. fever, infection, injury, change in 
mood, adverse reactions to medications). The new or worsening neurologic symptoms must have met 
either of the following: 
•  An increase of at least 1.0 point on the EDSS score if the baseline score was 1.0 or higher or a 2.0-
point increase on the EDSS if the baseline score was zero; 
•  An increase of at least 2.0 points on one of the appropriate FSS; 
•  An increase of at least 1.0 point on two or more of the appropriate FSS if the baseline score was one 
or more; 
•  An increase of at least 1.0 point in single eye FSS when the baseline score in that eye was one or 
more. 
New or worsening neurological symptoms that occurred less than 31 days following the onset of a PDR 
will be considered part of the same relapse, and the onset date used in the analysis was the onset date 
of the first relapse. 
The base for comparison of the increase was the score from the most recent EDSS/FSS assessment visit 
prior  to  the  relapse.  The  appropriate  FSS  change  must  have  affected  at  least  one  of  the  following 
functional systems: pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel/bladder, or visual (single eye). 
In order to assess the consistency of the effect of satralizumab on relapses in a real-world setting where 
there is no CEC adjudication and assessment of relapses is by the patient’s treating clinician, the primary 
endpoint  was  assessed  using  sensitivity  analyses  based  on  clinical  relapses.  The  time  to  first  clinical 
relapse  and  time  to  first  treated  clinical  relapse  was  included  in  the  efficacy  analysis  of  both  studies 
BN40898 and BN40900. In study BN40898, patients were censored if given rescue treatment or if there 
was a change in IST. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Change from baseline in VAS score for pain and in FACIT fatigue scale at Week 24 were included in both 
studies  BN40898  and  BN40900  as  key  secondary  endpoints.  The  objective  of  the  key  secondary 
endpoints was to evaluate the benefit of satralizumab on pre-existing residual pain (VAS) and fatigue 
(FACIT fatigue scale), independently of relapses, within the first 24 weeks of treatment. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 62/132 
 
 
  
  
The VAS is a subjective measure of pain and it consists of a 100 mm line with descriptors of ‘no pain’ 
and ‘pain as bad as it could be’ at either end. Patients are asked to rate their pain by placing a mark on 
the line corresponding to their current level of pain. The distance along the line from the ‘no pain’ marker 
is then measured with a ruler giving a pain score out of 100. 
The FACIT fatigue scale includes 13 questions which measure fatigue/asthenia for patients with chronic, 
life-threatening illnesses. For each question, a patient rates their condition for the past week on a 5-
point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For the change in FACIT fatigue, descriptive 
statistics were calculated for the change in FACIT fatigue by averaging the individual question scores. 
Other secondary endpoints were designed to measure changes in pre-existing symptoms and, therefore, 
were assessed at pre-specified time points (every 24 weeks form baseline). The following were included 
as  efficacy  endpoints  in  both  studies:  Change  in  Short  Form  Health  Survey  36  Version  2  (SF-36v2) 
Scores,  Change  in  EuroQol-5D  3  Level  Version  (EQ-5D-3L),  Change  in  Modified  Rankin  Scale  (mRS) 
Score, Change in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) Score, Change in  EDSS Score, Change in Visual Acuity 
(Snellen  Chart),  ARR,  and    Proportion  of  Relapse-free  Patients.  There  were  two  additional  efficacy 
assessments included in the BN40900 study only: Change in Low-contrast Sloan Letter Chart (LCSLC) 
and Change in Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W). 
Sample Size 
Study BN40898 
A two-sided log-rank test was used to determine the sample size between the two groups. The sample 
size  of  70,  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  the  two  treatment  groups  with  26  TFR  events  in  total  was 
predicted to provide 80% power, maintaining the type I error rate of 0.05, and assuming a 2-year drop-
out rate of approximately 10%. The TFR hazard ratio of satralizumab over placebo was assumed to be 
0.335, which was expected to result in 66.5% reduction in the risk of relapse. The distribution of TFR in 
the placebo group was assumed to follow an exponential distribution with annual hazard rate of 0.4184. 
Study BN40900 
The original plan for the sample size was based on the following: 
A two-sided log-rank test was used to determine the sample size between the two groups. The sample 
size  of  70,  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  the  two  treatment  groups  with  19  TFR  events  in  total  was 
predicted to provide 80% power, maintaining the type I error rate of 0.05, and assuming a 2-year drop-
out rate of approximately 10%. The TFR hazard ratio of satralizumab over placebo was assumed to be 
0.25. The distribution of TFR in the placebo group was assumed to follow an exponential distribution with 
annual hazard rate of 0.4602. 
In protocol version 6 (dated 01 Mar 2016) the following changes were made: 
The  sample  size  was  increased  from  70  to  90  patients  and  the  total  number  of  CEC  confirmed  PDRs 
needed for primary analysis was increased from 19 to 44. These changes were done due to modified 
assumptions about the hazard ratio in the sample size calculation. The hazard ratio of satralizumab over 
placebo was modified considering the mechanism of action of satralizumab. It was assumed, that the 
hazard  ratio  is  1.0  during  the  initial  2  months.  Additionally,  the  estimated  post-baseline  ARR  in  the 
placebo group was updated from 0.4 to 1.35. 
In protocol version 8 (dated 14 Jun 2018) the following changes were made: 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 63/132 
 
 
  
  
The  definition  of  the  end  of  the  double-blind  period  was  changed  to  include  a  maximal  duration 
completion  of  1.5  years  after  the  date  of  the  last  patient  randomized,  if  the  target  number  of  CEC 
confirmed PDRs (44) has not been reached. 
Randomisation  
In Study BN40898, eligible patients were randomized to one of the two treatment groups: placebo (PCB) 
or satralizumab (SAT) in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive web/voice response system (IxRS) according to a 
pre-defined listing of randomization. The randomization was stratified by baseline ARR (ARR: 1, vs >1) 
and geographical region (Asia and Europe/Other). Administration of the study treatment occurred on the 
same day as randomization. 
In Study BN40900, eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to satralizumab and placebo groups 
via  an  lxRS  according  to  a  predefined  listing  of  randomization.  The  randomization  was  stratified  by 
baseline  therapy 
for  prevention  of  NMO  or  NMOSD  relapse  (B-cell  depleting  therapy  or 
immunosuppressants/others) and the most recent relapse (first attack or relapse) in the last year prior 
to screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain the blind during the DB period, a placebo vial filled with a solution identical in composition, 
colour,  appearance,  and  packaging  to  the  satralizumab  vial,  but  without  the  satralizumab  active 
ingredient, was supplied. Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, data analysts, 
and the Sponsor remained blinded to the identity of the treatment throughout the DB period. 
To further ensure blinding of the study, site staff, study monitors, the Sponsor, and the study team were 
blinded  for  some  of  the  laboratory  results  that  could  reveal  treatment  allocation,  such  as  serum 
satralizumab  concentration,  high-sensitivity  CRP,  IL-6,  sIL-6R,  ADA,  AQP4‐IgG  (except  at  screening), 
plasmablasts,  and  complement  (C3,  C4,  and  CH50),  until  the  primary  analysis.  Fibrinogen  data  was 
provided to the sites throughout the DB period for safety reasons; the possible bias introduced by the 
availability  of  fibrinogen  data  was  discussed  during  SA  (EMEA/H/SA/2571/2/FU/2/2018/PA/II)  and 
further evaluated in a separate bias assessment report (see conduction study for further details). 
To  maintain  blinding  of  the  efficacy  assessment,  the  Applicant  specified  two  study  features  in  the 
protocol: (1) the segregation of the treating and examining investigators at each study site and (2) the 
independent review of reported relapses by the CEC. The treating Investigator was responsible for patient 
care  and  the  examining  assessor  was  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  EDSS  and  FSS.  The 
examining assessor who filled in the EDSS/FSS data included in the relapse assessment form did not 
have access to laboratory data. Before adjudication, the CEC package including relapse data was checked  
staff at the CRO for completeness and adherence to the scoring conventions of the EDSS scale. Finally, 
the independent CEC reviewed the data and made a final assessment.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The ITT population was the primary analysis population for the efficacy analysis and included all patients 
randomized. Patients were analysed in the group to which they were randomized.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 64/132 
 
 
  
  
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) population included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 3 
doses of study drug, and without any major protocol deviations that were considered to have an impact 
on efficacy. 
Efficacy analysis 
All analyses were stratified using the same stratification variables as in the randomisation (see above).  
Kaplan-Meier estimates and their 95% CIs at 6-month intervals were used to describe the TFR based on 
PDR distribution in addition to the hazard ratio (HR). For study BN40898, the TFR was censored at the 
earliest day of 1) the end of DB period, 2) switching or increasing the baseline treatment, or 3) receiving 
rescue therapy for clinical relapse. For study BN 40900 the TFR was censored at the end of DB period. 
The key sensitivity analyses included in both studies BN40898 and BN40900 were those of time to first 
clinical relapse and time to first treated clinical relapse; these analyses allow for the assessment of the 
efficacy of satralizumab in the real-world setting, where relapse assessment is conducted by the patient’s 
treating clinician rather than the CEC employed in the clinical study setting. 
Both  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  Analysis  of  Covariance  (ANCOVA).  The 
ANCOVA analyses for change from baseline to Week 24 included treatment group as a fixed effect; and 
baseline measurements and stratification factors as covariates. The missing data was imputed by the 
baseline  observation  carried  forward  (BOCF)  method.  Exploratory  analyses  of  the  key  secondary 
endpoints were performed using ANCOVA multiple imputation method (random hot deck; change from 
baseline  to  Week  24)  and  mixed-effect  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  (change  from  baseline  to 
every 24-week interval). The random hot deck imputation method using a regression-based approach 
was  conducted.  In  this  imputation  method,  missing  values  were  replaced  with  values  from  a  similar 
responding  unit.  The  MMRM  included  treatment  group,  protocol-specified  visit,  treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed effects; the baseline measurements and stratification factors as a covariate; and visit 
as a repeated measure. The unstructured covariance matrix was assumed in the model. For all MMRM 
analyses,  in  case  of  normality  assumption  not  being  met,  generalized  estimating  equations  (GEE)  or 
Generalized Linear Mixed-effect model analysis was used. The normality assumption was checked prior 
to unblinding. 
For the FACIT fatigue questionnaire, if there were less than 7 responses recorded, then the total fatigue 
score was considered missing. If there were 7 or more responses recorded, then the total fatigue score 
for that questionnaire was calculated as the average of the non-missing scores multiplied by 13. This 
approach was taken in both studies BN40898 and BN40900. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In  study  BN40898,  the  total  of  83  enrolled  patients  were  randomized  in  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
satralizumab  (SAT)  or  matching  placebo  SC  (PCB  group)  treatment  at  Weeks  0,  2,  and  4,  and  Q4W 
thereafter, administered in combination with the baseline immunosuppressive treatment (Figure 7 ). For 
each patient, the DB period lasted until they received their first dose of  treatment in the OLE, or until 
the withdrawal visit. For the study, the DB period included in the primary analysis ended once the total 
number of PDRs confirmed by the CEC reached 26. 
In study BN40900, a total of 95 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either satralizumab 
(SAT) (N=63) or matching placebo SC (PCB group) (N=32) treatment at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, and Q4W 
thereafter (Figure 8). For each patient, the DB period lasted until the day before they received the first 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021

dose of treatment in the OLE, or until the withdrawal visit. For the study, the DB period for the primary 
analysis ended when the last patient enrolled was treated for 1.5 years since the date of randomization. 
Patients who experienced a relapse that did not meet the definition of a PDR were treated with rescue 
therapy and continued to receive study treatment in the DB period at the discretion of the investigator.

Conduct of the study 
Fibrinogen levels-related GCP breach 
On 2018, the Applicant requested a follow-up SA to discuss with EMA, a GCP breach in the conduction 
of the two studies. Fibrinogen concentration data had been utilised on 2 occasions (in November 2015 
and May 2017) by the previous Sponsor in attempts to assume treatment assignment for both pivotal 
studies. HRs were calculated based on this assumed treatment assignment. A temporal association with 
protocol amendments first increasing size and the required number of primary endpoint events (Q1 2016 
amend 6) and later revising the end of study as the maximum of 1.5 years after the date of randomization 
of the last patient and therefore,  decreasing the number  of events  (Q2 2018 amend 8)  were  seen in 
study BN40900. No changes were made to Study BN40898. 
Within  the  SA  (EMEA/H/SA/2571/2/FU/2/2018/PA/II),  the  Applicant  presented  this  GCP  breach  and 
seeked advice about the adequacy of the proposed mitigation actions including the implementation of 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 67/132 
 
 
  
  
 
independent  safety  and  efficacy  medical  reviewers,  and  limitation  of  efficacy  reviewer  access  to 
laboratory parameters as well as the commitment to prepare a bias report analysing the potential biases 
on  the  clinical  data  to  be  submitted  within  this  MAA.  Overall,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  proposed 
mitigation  actions  for  the  further  study  conduct  but  it  was  concluded  that  scientific  integrity  of  both 
studies should be fully investigated at the time of MAA. 
During that SA, the CHMP specifically questioned whether information on fibrinogen concentrations may 
have impacted treatment decisions regarding clinical parameter assessments (e.g. EDSS, relapses) in 
both  studies  given  that  it  seemed  plausible  that  investigators  were  informed  about  the  association 
between SAT exposure and fibrinogen concentrations which were available to the investigators for safety 
purposes. The Applicant presented the relapse assessment procedure as described in the blinding section 
above and noted that the examining assessor had not access to laboratory data.  
Moreover, the CHMP requested the Applicant to clarify whether the calculations had an impact on the 
protocol  amendment  (number  6)  to  increase  the  required  number  of  events  in  the  protocol  of  study 
BN40900  in  Q1  2016.  The  Applicant  stated  that  the  decision  was  based  on  the  faster  relapse 
accumulation  and  higher  number  of  early  relapses  (i.e.  relapses  within  the  first  2  months  after 
randomization) than assumed in the initial sample size calculation and was completely independent of 
the treatment assignment attempt. 
Findings during GCP inspections 
Four GCP inspections, including two clinical site-, a Sponsor-, and a CRO-inspection were performed.  
The inspections resulted in critical findings relating to deficiencies in the documentation recording the 
segregation of treating and examining investigators and to the review of the CEC package performed by 
the  Sponsor  before  sending  it  to  the  CEC.  A  total  of  10  critical  findings  and  19  major  findings  were 
identified. According to the integrated inspection report, data from at least 33 (28%) of patients could 
have been negatively affected in terms of data integrity 
The inspection team reported findings associated with the difficulty to effectively confirm the segregation 
of the examining and treating investigators. In particular, the following findings were found incomplete 
documentation, missing documents, documents filed out the trial master file (eTMF), changes made to 
forms not adhering to ALCOA (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, and Accurate) principles 
and missing or erroneous notes-to-file.  
Moreover, the inspection team found that queries and answers shared between the Sponsor/CRO staff 
and the investigators as well as changes in the FSS and EDSS scores, were not recorded and stored in 
a clear and systematic way to reconstruct and trace all events in both trials from a chronological point 
of  view  (e.g.  if  the  EDSS  was  adapted  according  to  FSS  or  vice  versa  and  if  changes  were  done  in 
agreement with the investigator or the way the CRO determined). Additionally, one potentially leading 
query was identified in the integrated inspection report. Finally, the inspector reported noted numerous 
accesses to the electronic system (VCAS) used for managing relapse assessment forms. 
Baseline data 
In study BN49898, the most common treatment at baseline (BN40898) was oral corticosteroids (44.6%), 
followed by azathioprine (34.9%) and mycophenolate (14.5%). The number of adolescents enrolled in 
the trial was 7: of them, 3 (1 Asian, 2 African American) were in the placebo (PCB) arm and 4 (white) 
in the satralizumab (SAT) arm, with mean ages 15.7 and 15.3 years, respectively (Table 10).  
In study BN40900, there was a higher proportion of female patients in the PCB group (96.9%) compared 
to the SAT group (73.0%) and the higher proportion of black/African American patients in the SAT group 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 68/132 
 
 
  
  
(20.6%)  compared  to  the  PCB  group  (9.4%).  Patients  were  predominantly  female  (81.1%)  and  the 
majority of the patients were of white (62.1%) race. The mean age of patients was 44 years and the 
median age was 45 years. The majority of patients were <65 years of age (98.9%). Two-thirds (67.4%) 
of the patients were AQP4-IgG-seropositive at baseline (number of AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients was 
capped at approximately 30%). A total of 33 patients (34.7%) had not received IST or corticosteroid 
treatment for relapse prevention prior to baseline (SAT: PCB 23 [36.5%]: 10 [31.3%]). Four patients 
(6.3%)  in  the  SAT  group  and  3  patients  (9.4%)  in  the  PCB  group  received  treatment  for  relapse 
prevention prior to baseline with corticosteroids alone (Table 11).

Outcomes and estimation 
The  data  presented  are  based  on  the  primary  analysis  conducted  on  the  basis  of  the  DB  primary 
evaluation period of 24 weeks in each pivotal study.

In study BN40898, an analysis using the stratified log-rank test showed that treatment with SAT led to 
a statistically significant 62% reduction in the HR of experiencing a protocol-defined relapse compared 
to PCB.

In study BN40898 patients were censored if there was a change in baseline treatment or if they were 
treated with rescue treatment. Upon request, the Applicant presented a new analysis when time to first 
PDR, rescue medication and change in baseline medications were considered as events (Table 15 
Table ).

Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis in the sense that the HR estimates were 
all  below 1.00, in both studies. In  study  BN 40898,  hardly any sensitivity analysis reached  statistical 
significance (<0.05).

Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
ARR using the first relapses for PDRs in study BN40898 was 0.11 (95% CI 0.05-0.21) unadjusted in the 
verum arm vs. 0.32 (95% CI 0.19-0.51) in the placebo arm, giving a 74% reduction in adjusted ARR 
(adjusted ARR ratio 0.261; 95% CI 0.087,0.787; p=0.0175).  
ARR using the first relapses for PDRs in study BN40900 was 0.17 (95% CI 0.10-0.26) unadjusted in the 
verum arm vs. 0.41 (95% CI 0.19-0.51) in the placebo arm, giving a 73% reduction in adjusted ARR 
(adjusted ARR ratio 0.275; p=0.0668). 
Ancillary analyses 
To identify potential prognostic factors, a Cox regression for time to PDR in patients treated with  PCB 
(N=74) was conducted. BW ≥ median (vs. below median) (HR=1.58 95% CI(0.79, 3.16) p=0.1950) and 
AQP4‐IgG seronegative (versus seropositive) (HR=0.60 95% CI(0.28, 1.31) p=0.1984) were identified 
as possible negative prognostic factors. 
Results by Aquaporin-4-Immunoglobulin G Serostatus 
Patients who were AQP4-IgG-seropositive at baseline had a higher risk of relapses and a lower HR than 
those who were AQP4-IgG-seronegative. Therefore, AQP4-IgG serostatus appears to be both prognostic 
and predictive. Further subgroup analyses for time to PDR were performed.

When data across studies BN40898 and BN40900 were pooled, treatment with satralizumab led to an 
overall HR of 0.25 [95% CI]; (0.12-0.50]) in AQP4‐IgG-seropositive patients. Differences in the time to 
first PDR in AQP4-IgG seronegative patients between those patients receiving satralizumab and those 
receiving placebo were not significant (Table 19).

Upon request, the Applicant provided sensitivity analysis for efficacy endpoints for AQP4‐IgG seropositive 
patients (Figure  15 and

Figure 16). For AQP4-IgG seropositive patients in Study BN40898, the Applicant has been requested to 
provide two additional analyses (i) counting time to first PDR, rescue medication and change in baseline 
medications as events and (ii) when only time to first PDR and rescue treatment were considered events. 
The corresponding analyses yielded (i) a HR of 0.55 (CI 0.26, 1.14) and (ii) a HR of 0.51 (CI 0.24, 1.10).

Results by Region 
When data across studies BN40898 and BN40900 were pooled, treatment with satralizumab led to a HR 
of  0.09  (95%  CI):  (0.01,  0.70)  in  patients  from  Asia,  HR  0.42  (95%  CI):  0.42  (0.19,  0.93)  in 
Europe/Other, and a HR of 0.70 (95% CI): (0.28, 1.70) for patients from North America. 
Some imbalances  could be confounding factors that  could have contributed to a lower efficacy in the 
overall  population  in  North  America,  for  example,  differences  in  the  proportion  of  black  patients,  BW 
differences and AQP4‐IgG serostatus. 
Results by Race 
When data across the two studies were pooled, treatment with satralizumab led to a HR of 0.14 (95% 
CI): (0.03, 0.62) in Asian patients and a HR of 0.38 (95% CI): (0.20, 0.74) in white patients. The number 
of black patients included in the studies was small and, therefore, a HR for this subgroup could not be 
determined. Of the 13 black patients receiving satralizumab, 7 (53.8%) experienced a PDR, and in the 
5 receiving placebo, 1 (20.0%) experienced a PDR. 
Results by body weight 
In  study  BN40898,  results  for  the  different  BW  quartiles  were  variable  showing  no  evident  trend.  In 
study BN40900, results were consistent across all BW quartiles. Thus, while BW was shown to possibly 
be a negative prognostic factor, it did not seem to be predictive of treatment effect. 
Results by Anti-drug Antibody Status 
In  Study  BN40898,  ADAs  were  detected  in  17  out  of  41  patients  (41.5%)  treated  with  satralizumab 
during the DB period. In Study BN40900, ADAs were detected in 45 out of 63 patients (71.4%) treated 
with satralizumab during the DB period (Table 20).

Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
Maintenance of efficacy was analysed based on data from the DB period and the OLE and includes only 
patients initially randomized to satralizumab. Thus, data over a period of up to 4 years are available for 
the evaluation of long-term efficacy. The ARR by year for treated clinical relapses over the combined DB 
and OLE period for patients originally assigned to  satralizumab was assessed (Table  23). No  patients 
receiving satralizumab withdrew from the OLE due to a clinical relapse.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooling of studies 
An analysis plan was made to pooling of the datasets from each pivotal phase III trial for safety and the 
primary and key secondary efficacy analyses.  Both event-driven studies were regarded as conducted in 
the same target group of patients, the visit schedules as well as the same primary and key secondary 
endpoints  (i.e.,  time  to  first  protocol-defined  relapse,  change  in  VAS  for  pain  to  Week  24,  change  in 
FACIT fatigue score to Week 24), were uniform. Target numbers of PDR of 26 for Study BN40898 and of 
44  for  Study  BN40900.  One  important  difference  between  the  two  pivotal  studies  though,  was  that 
patients  in  Study  BN40898  patients  were  censored  when  experiencing  a  relapse  requiring  rescue 
treatment or if there was a change in baseline medication. 
The  consistency  of  the  satralizumab  treatment  effect  was  tested  by  analyses  of  the  relapse-related 
endpoints in subgroups including region, race, BW, AQP4‐IgG serostatus, and ADA status across the two 
studies BN40898 and BN40900. Pooling of data from studies BN40898 and BN40900 was used for these 
subgroup analyses to help overcome the problem of limited patient numbers. 
Pooled results have been presented in most of the previous sections in parallel with the results of single 
studies.

Table 28: Time to first PDR during the DB period in individual studies and in the pooled data 
The similarity of the pivotal trial designs has reasonably enabled the scrutiny of them in parallel and by 
pooling  of  the  datasets.  The  consistency  of  the  results  despite  many  differences  between  the  trial 
populations may be considered positive. On  the  other hand, the pooling of data for efficacy analyses 
brings  about  a  significant  additional  element  of  heterogeneity  albeit  that  the  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints as well as visit schedules of the trials were uniform, not taking into account that patients with 
relapses needing rescue treatment were censored in study BN40898. 
The  pooled  analysis  was  obviously  not  pre-planned,  as  evidenced  by  the  varying  stratifications  and 
censoring  rules,  which  makes  extra  demands  on  the  comparability  and  poolability,  as  well  as  e.g. 
sensitivity analyses, and limits the extent of subgroup analyses, which partly remain study-specific and 
very restricted. Considering the sample size, the heterogeneity and breaking down into various subsets 
leaves  an  uncertainty  as  to  whether  useful  information  can  finally  be  gathered  through  the  many 
numbers  of  subgroup  analyses.  Moreover,  pooling  is  not  necessarily  straightforward  in  that  the  GCP 
violation and the succeeding protocol amendments result in loss of control of type 1 error in the study 
BN40900.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Special subpopulations within the pivotal studies were age-based.  
Subpopulation of the elderly 
The inclusion was restricted to patients under 75 years of age in each pivotal study. The study BN40898 
included a minimum quota of adolescent patients. PK aspects in these special subpopulations have been 
commented  on  previously.  The  subpopulation  of  the  elderly  (65-74  years)  was  limited:  in  the  study 
BN40898  the  age  grouping  is  mainly  given  as  adolescents  vs.  adults  (≥18  years,  and  in  the  study 
BN40900 only one patient≥65 years was enrolled.   
There were only four patients 65 years or older when entering  the two pivotal studies. Six additional 
patients reached the age of 65 years during the study period. No data are presented for these additional 
patients. To enable some analyses, the  Applicant used  all  patients age  > 55 years at  screening.  This 
yielded  29  patients  pooled  from  the  two pivotal  studies,  and  24  of  these  were  AQP4-IgG  positive.  In 
these 24 patients, there were 4 PDRs (1  SAT) and 6 rescue treated relapses (all in  SAT). Due to few 
patients and events any conclusion is difficult to draw, but this pattern with fewer PDRs but more slightly 
milder relapses in the SAT treated patients. EDSS change in the six rescue treated relapses show that 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 94/132 
 
 
  
  
 
these probably were mild. Of patients censored, most (10 of 18) stayed in the study until study end and 
6 had a relapse treated with rescue as discussed above.  
In total, with the available sparse data including reduced number of patients and events does not allow 
reaching conclusions. However, a similar trend is observed in patients aged over 55 years as in younger 
patients. 
Subpopulation of adolescents  
The  spectrum  of  disease  in  children  appears  to  be  similar  to  that  in  adults  but  the  incidence  is 
considerably lower (approximately 0.02:100 000 but variable by race). The study BN40898 included a 
minimum quota of adolescent patients (n=8; at least four were to be AQP4-IgG-positive), based on the 
hypothesis that from a PK point of view it would be acceptable to apply the flat dosing to this age cohort. 
Specific modifications were made to inclusion criterion 2 (they had to have clinical evidence of at least 2 
documented relapses including the first attack prior to screening) and laboratory inclusion criterion (in 
case  of  retest,  the  last  retest  value  before  randomization  must  meet  the  study  criteria),  and  as  the 
baseline  IST, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil combined with  corticosteroids were  allowed. The 
following endpoints were specified for the adolescent population in listings by the protocol: TFR (protocol-
defined  relapse),  EDSS  scores.  Visual  acuity  (Snellen  chart)  scores,  SF-36  domain  scores,  SF-36 
summary score (physical and mental), VAS for pain score, FACIT fatigue scale score, EQ-5D scores, mRS 
scores, and ZBI scores.  
The majority of the adolescent patients (n=6) were females. Four patients were white, 2 patients were 
black/African American, and 1 patient was Asian (non-Japanese). The mean age was 15 years, age range 
13-17 years. 5 patients were diagnosed with NMO and 2 patients with NMOSD. Three patients (2 in the 
PCB  group  and  1  in  the  SAT  group)  tested  positive  for  AQP4‐IgG  at  screening.  Three  patients  had  a 
baseline ARR of 1 and four patients had a baseline ARR >1. During the DB period, a clinical relapse was 
experienced by 3 of 3 adolescents in the PCB group (1 PDR) and 1 of 4 adolescents in the SAT group (1 
PDR). Consequently, the HR for the primary endpoint of time to first PDR in this subgroup could not be 
correctly calculated and was inconclusive, due to the small sample size.  
The available, albeit limited, efficacy data in adolescent patients enrolled in Study BN40898 do not lend 
arguments to doubting extrapolation. 
Supportive studies 
The supportive studies Phase  I studies with healthy controls and RA patients do not provide data for 
assessment of efficacy. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  development  program  designed  with  satralizumab  on  NMO/NMOSD  patients  enrolled  178 
patients in the two Phase III studies. These data provided the study population for the initial efficacy 
assessment.  Since  efficacy  was  not  shown  in  patients  lacking  AQP4-IgG,  the  Applicant  suggested  a 
restriction in the indication to only include patients with  AQP4-IgG. Thus, the pooled study population 
for further analyses comprise of 119 patients. Both studies are randomized and placebo-controlled by 
design, with the difference that the study BN40898 (55 patients) investigated the study drug or placebo 
as  an  add-on  treatment  to  stable  baseline  IST,  whereas  the  study  BN40900  (64  patients)  compared 
satralizumab  to  placebo  as  monotherapy  in  treatment  of  NMO/NMOSD.  At  the  time,  there  was  no 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 95/132 
 
 
  
  
approved  treatment  for  the  disease,  and  consequently,  a  placebo-controlled  design  (with  2:1 
randomization scheme) was acceptable and justified. Both studies were designed to have  OLE phases, 
which are on-going. The patient population is stringently defined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
and although the diagnostic criteria have been revised during the course of the study, it  is considered 
that the study population is essentially representative of the NMO/NMOSD spectrum. The study BN40898 
had a small quota for adolescents which is too limited for assessment of efficacy. However, kinetic and 
bibliographic data support extrapolation of efficacy from adults to this subgroup. The number of elderly 
patients was very limited, only 4 patients were 65 years or older at randomisation. In a subgroup analysis 
performed on patients aged over 55 years, the available data are still limited with respect to number of 
patients  (5 treated with placebo, 19 with satralizumab) and events (4 PDRs, 6 TCRs) and do not allow 
reaching conclusions. However, a similar trend with respect to efficacy is observed in patients aged over 
55 years as in younger patients.   
Both global Phase III studies BN40898 and BN40900 were event driven studies with a primary endpoint 
of time to first PDR during the DB period, the duration of which was determined  by the target number 
of PDRs. As the disability associated with  NMO/NMOSD  accumulates predominantly through relapses, 
the choice of the primary endpoint is acceptable. The definition for the criteria of the clinical endpoint is 
detailed by the protocol, and the events were adjudicated centrally by an independent CEC. 
The selected key secondary endpoints were clinically determined: pain, measured with VAS score, and 
fatigue measured with FACIT score at 24 weeks. The choices are in principle adequate, as both overall 
pain and fatigue are regarded as the most common and disabling symptoms of NMO/NMOSD. The other 
secondary endpoints  were also based on  clinical assessment  (change in EDSS score as a measure of 
disability, mRS as an overall outcome score, visual acuity scores), or self-assessment (SF-36 Generic 
Health Survey summary scores for Physical and Mental domains and domain wise scores for quality-of-
life assessment, as well as EQ-5D scores). Time-to-event dimension yielded ARR and the proportion of 
relapse-free patients. The caregiver burden was attempted to assess with Zarit burden interview scores. 
On  the  whole,  the  selection  of  secondary  endpoints  is  pertinent.  However,  the  timepoints  used  for 
measurements of secondary efficacy endpoints were inappropriate and yielded data only from patients 
without relapses. 
The statistical methodology is principally acceptable. However, unblinding, as an overshadowing breach 
of GCP conduct, was disclosed: the changes in fibrinogen levels indicative of treatment assignment were 
available during the studies, and the primary efficacy endpoint was calculated based on this. A temporal 
association with protocol amendments first increasing the number of events aimed at, at later decreasing 
the number of events aimed at, was seen in study BN40900. According to Scientific Advice procedure 
(EMEA/H/SA/2571/2/FU/2/2018/PA/II),  a  separate  bias  assessment  report  was  submitted  by  the 
Applicant  in  which  no  introduction  of  bias  could  be  detected.  However,  as  with  pre-planned  interim 
analyses, these calculations lead to spending of alpha in both studies, and the main issue, the loss of 
control over the type I error, has been further discussed, but this cannot be controlled in retrospect. The 
efficacy  data  estimated  using  fibrinogen  data  may,  or  may  not,  have  been  used  in  the  decisions  for 
protocol amendments.  
The  pivotal  studies  have  a  similar  design  with  equal  dosage,  primary  endpoint  (except  differences  in 
censoring patients in of rescue therapy) and most of the secondary endpoints, and this intrinsic similarity 
with some harmonizing measures have enabled pooling of the datasets and assessment of the pooled 
data for additional statistical power. Nevertheless, the populations have many differences arising from 
the  geographical,  racial  and  demographical  variability.  While  adding  strength  to  the  side  of  ‘benefit 
despite  variability’,  the  ensuing  heterogeneity  also  obscures  the  role  of  individual  predictors  (weight, 
race, geography, ADA status) and detracts from the possibility to perform reasonable subgroup analyses, 
which dimension is essentially curtailed by the limited sample size at the outset.

GCP inspections 
Four  GCP  inspections,  including  two  clinical  site-,  a  Sponsor-,  and  a  CRO-inspection  were  performed 
during the assessment period. 
The  inspections  identified  critical  findings  associated  with  the  difficulty  to  effectively  confirm  the 
segregation of the examining and treating investigators. In response to a request from the inspection 
team, the Applicant reviewed the totality of these issues and, in collaboration with the CRO and site staff, 
provided confirmation for the separation of the roles for all but 6 out of 86 total findings which could not 
be resolved due to site closure or change in site staff. The CHMP concluded that even if the documentation 
intended to ensure that the examining and treating investigators were separated in some cases was not 
optimal, there were no evidence that unblinding of the examining assessor had occurred. 
Additional  critical  findings  concerned  the  review  of  the  CEC  package  by  the  Sponsor,  a  process  that 
included  queries  to  the  investigators  and  changes  of  the  relapse  assessment  forms.  One  potentially 
leading  query  was  identified  in  the  integrated  inspection  report.    Finally,  numerous  accesses  to  the 
electronic system (VCAS) used for managing relapse assessment forms were noted. In response to a 
request  from  the  inspection  team,  the  Applicant  acknowledged  the  numerous  changes  to  the  CEC 
package forms as well as limitations to evaluate the temporal sequence of events: (1) the use of a paper-
based process instead of an electronic data capture system and (2) the incomplete corrective action of 
filing the relapse packages with queries together in the eTMF because the text was truncated in some of 
the  queries  due  to  technical  limitations.  As  part  of  the  responses,  the  Applicant  performed  a  post 
database-lock internal review to identify and assess the impact of query-related corrections to relapse 
documentation. According to the report, queries were triggered as appropriate and resulted in corrections 
to the forms when necessary. Further, an evaluation of the validity of all changes made in response to 
queries, using the clinical data available in the complete relapse assessment dossier, could  identify the 
rationale for each change.  During the oral explanation, the Applicant confirmed that all documentation 
had been completed and filed in date order as requested, and the corrective action had been resolved. 
The  final  Applicant  position  was  that  these  changes  were  required  to  ensure  complete  and  accurate 
forms.  Finally,  even  if  there  were  numerous  accesses  to  VCAS,  the  Applicant  reviewed  the  complete 
access listing and confirmed the access rights were given appropriately.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary clinical effect size in the pivotal studies (AQP4-IgG seropositive patients) were of the same 
magnitude,  HR  0.21  and  0.26  respectively  (in  the  pooled  analysis  HR  was  0.25),  which  is  not  only 
statistically  significant  but  are  also  considered  clinically  meaningful  and  relevant.  Since  the  efficacy 
cannot  be  considered  demonstrated  in  the  AQP-IgG  negative  subpopulation,  the  indication  has  been 
restricted to patients who have AQP4-IgG. 
A  reduced  effect  was  observed  in  both  studies  when  relapses  were  analysed  according  the  treating 
investigators  (sensitivity  analysis  for  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  patients),  with  respect  to  the  relapses 
adjudicated by the CEC Study BN40898: HR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.25-1.12, p-value: 0.092; Study BN40900: 
HR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.25-1.03, p-value: 0.056). The difference in effect size between physician diagnosed 
and  protocol-defined  relapses  has  not  changed  for  either  study,  why  the  effect  size  of  the  medicinal 
product in real life may be less pronounced. 
The support that the sensitivity analyses  give to the main result is not substantial although they  are 
largely consistent. To correct for the lack of sensitivity analysis challenging the censoring rules in study 
BN40898 (censoring at a relapse not fulfilling PDR criteria but needing pre-defined rescue treatment), a 
supplementary analysis in which the rescue therapy and increase in background IST were accounted as 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 97/132 
 
 
  
  
events, yielded a HR of 0.60 with 95% CI [0.33, 1.08] and a p-value of 0.0847 and a HR of 0.55 (CI 
0.26, 1.14) in the AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD group. 
The  clinical  secondary  endpoints  were  not  met,  which  was  a  consistent  finding  in  both  studies  and 
repeated when only AQP4-IgG positive patients were included in the analyses. The reasons for this may 
be low scores at baseline and because assessment at week 24 was performed in patients still remaining 
in the study, i e those without a relapse. 
Another  issue  is  dose-exposure-response  relationship.  On  the  basis  of  PK  studies,  it  is  apparent  that 
there is variability in exposure, which depends on factors such as BW and the potential presence of ADAs, 
which  lead  to  lower  exposure  levels.  It  was  expected  this  would  have  a  bearing  on  efficacy.  Lower 
exposure  and  RO  were  however  not  demonstrated  to  correlate  with  lower  efficacy  based  on  the  full 
patient population. There may be neutralising ADAs, but there is no assay for detection and their clinical 
impact  seems  minor.  Since  the  exposure/efficacy  analysis  has  been  performed  in  a  biased  dataset 
containing AQP4-IgG seronegative patients and repeated in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients. The AQP4-
IgG seropositive patients analysis suggested that the satralizumab effect on TFR1 was not dependant on 
the exposure, when compared to placebo. There is thus no indication that the dose is not adequate. 
Potential predictors in light of statistics could also be race, in that Asian population had a clearer effect 
whereas    black  patients  did  not  respond  as  expected,  but  these  associations  may  be  confounded  by 
asymmetries in the distribution of BW and AQP4-IgG seropositivity between races, as well as the very 
limited  size  of  e.g.  the  subgroup  of  black  people.  In  the  literature,  probable  differences  in  clinical 
phenotype in patients with African ancestry are described, but the major pathophysiology is likely similar 
in  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  patients  with  African  ancestry  comparted  to  other  AQP4-IgG  seropositive 
patients.  The  baseline  BW  and  anti-AQP4-IgG  status  were  comparable  between  the  placebo  and 
satralizumab groups in black patients and the results obtained in these patients (high relapse rate in the 
satralizumab group) are likely a chance findings. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The primary clinical effect size in the pivotal studies for AQP4-IgG seropositive patients were statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful and relevant. Even if the effect size was reduced when relapses were 
analysed according the treating investigators, there was still nearly a 50% reduction on the rate relapse 
for the intended population of AQP4-IgG seropositive patients, an effect size that can be still considered 
clinically relevant.  
The complete lack of effect for the key secondary outcome endpoints left the primary efficacy endpoint 
without support. On the other hand, this may not undermine the effect on the primary outcome assessing 
the  effect  on  prevention  of  relapses,  the  key  determinant  of  permanent  neurological  impairment  in 
NMOSD. 
Nevertheless, both the Fibrinogen levels-related GCP breach and the aforementioned findings recorded 
in  the  GCP  inspections  affecting  both  trials  raised  concerns  over  the  reliability  and  robustness  of  the 
efficacy findings. The importance of these GCP issues are further discuss in the B/R assessment (section 
3).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety data for satralizumab is based on the primary  analysis of the two pivotal Phase III studies 
BN40898  and  BN40900  in  patients  with  NMO  and  NMOSD,  from  a  total  of  145  satralizumab-treated 
patients with 328 patient-years of exposure (mean duration: 114 weeks; including data from 63 patients 
who  switched  to  administration  via  PFS),  in  which  90  patients  followed  for  more  than  96  weeks.  In 
addition, supportive safety data are provided from 72 healthy volunteers (Study SA-001JP) and 33 RA 
patients (Study SA-105JP). 
During the DB period, a total of 104 patients were exposed to at least one dose of satralizumab, and a 
total  of  74  patients  were  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of  placebo  (Table  29).  The  pooled  patient 
population with respect to background IST during the DB period is rather unbalanced since more patients 
in the placebo group are coming from the study BN40898 with a background IST (42 out of 74 patients), 
while the majority of satralizumab treatment patients are coming from the study BN40900 (63 out of 
104 patients).  
The  patients  age  stretches  from  13  to  73  years  old  in  the  pooled  dataset  from  2  phase  III  studies.  
Overall, 7 patients at age 12 to <18 years old were treated with satralizumab. Seven patients <18 years 
of age were included into the study BN40898  (placebo n=3, satralizumab n=4) during the DB period 
(Table  30). The mean duration of observation in the DB period was 33.2 weeks (median: 31.7 weeks, 
range: 13.0-72.1 weeks) and the mean duration of observation on satralizumab including the OLE phase 
was 55.3 weeks (median: 44.1 weeks, range: 16.3-99.3 weeks). The Applicant reported 4 patients above 
65 years in satralizumab treatment group in the pooled dataset (Table 30). However, it is not clear if 
there were elderly patients in the placebo group. Among patients treated with satralizumab there were 
20.2% of males while in placebo group there  were only 4.1% of males. Regarding BW and BMI  both 
treatment groups in the pooled dataset were relatively-well balanced, but it should be noted that patients 
BW and BMI were higher in the BN40900 study (monotherapy) compared to study BN40898 (add-on 
treatment). Median BW in placebo group was 61 kg and 69 kg, satralizumab group 57 kg and 75 kg in 
studies BN40898 and BN40900, respectively. Similar differences were noted also for the BMI: BMI ≥30 
in  placebo  group  –  14%  and  22%;  satralizumab  12%  and  34%  in  studies  BN40898  and  BN40900, 
respectively.  
The  baseline  disease  characteristics  regarding  proportion  of  NMO  and  NMOSD  patients,  number  of 
relapses, EDSS as well as proportion of patients positive for AQP4‐IgG were balanced between treatment 
groups in pooled safety dataset as well as individual studies. Mean number of relapses in the two years 
prior to randomization was 1.18, and approximately equal proportions of patients in each group had ARR 
>1 (in total, 37.6%).

Adverse events 
In general, in both Phase III studies, the overall rates of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were comparable 
between  treatment  groups.  The  frequency  of  severe  AEs  was  high  with  17  patients  (27%,  32 
events/100PY) in Satralizumab group in the study BN40898, which is higher than that in the PCB groups 
(6.3%  9.85  events  /100PY).  In  study  BN40900,  the  rate  was  lower  in  both  the  SAT  group  (12%, 
6.37events/100PY) and the PCB group (12%, 11.67 events/100PY).

Table 31: Overview of Adverse Events (Pooled Phase III studies; DB Period BN40898 and BN40900) 
N=number of patients with event, E=Number of events 
In general, the AE rates were comparable between SAT and  PCB treatment arms in individual studies 
BN40898  and  BN40900  as  well  as  in  pooled  safety  dataset  during  DB  period  for  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation or dose interruption, infections, serious infections and potential opportunistic infections 
(Table 31). More injection related reactions (IRR) were reported in SAT-treated compared to PCB patients 
in pooled safety dataset from the DB period (Table 31). This difference was driven primarily by data of 
the study BN40898 (SAT - 21.65 AEs/100PY, PCB – 3.36 AEs/100PY). It is unclear if it could be related 
to background IST. 
Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were  the most frequently 
reported AEs observed in both studies, the higher frequencies of these events were in the SAT than PCB 
group except for urinary tract infection. The most frequently reported AEs (≥10%) for SAT versus PCB 
in the study BN40898 were nasopharyngitis (24.4% vas 16.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (24.4% 
vs 14.3%), urinary tract infection (17.1% vas 16.7%). The most frequently reported AEs (≥10%) for 
SAT  versus  PCB  in  study  BN40900  were  nasopharyngitis  (14.3%  vas  3.1%),  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (15.9% vs 18.8%), and urinary tract infection (17.5% vas 25.5%). 
The lower rate of AEs/100PY in the SAT group was also observed in the System Organ Class (SOC) Blood 
and Lymphatic System Disorders based on event/100 PY (58.94% vs 28.39% events/100Py). In fact, 
more patients (n=31, 29.8%) in the SAT group than PCB (n=13, 17.6%) reported these AEs. The higher 
rate of AEs in the PCB group was mainly driven by multiple events reported by 3 patients; 2 patients in 
the study BN40898 (1 patient reported 20 events and a second patient reported 14 events) and 1 patient 
in the study BN40900 (9 events of neutropenia). For AEs presented by 100PY, multiple occurrences of 
the same AE in one patient are counted multiple times. In addition, 2 patients reporting multiple events 
are coming from the study BN40898 with concomitant IST.    
The frequency of neutropenia, leukopenia and decreased white blood cell count were higher in the SAT 
group vs PCB (5.8% vs 4.1%, 7.7% vs 5.4% and 5.8% vs 0, respectively). In the study BN40898, the 
frequency of leukopenia report was more frequent in SAT vs PCB (14.6% vs 9.5%). 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 101/132 
 
 
  
  
 
AEs by SOC gastrointestinal were reported in 37% of patients, an only nausea was reported in the SAT 
group with a higher frequency than in PCB (13.5 % vs 6.8%). 
A higher frequency of AEs in the SOC Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders was observed in 
the SAT group than in PCB (43.3% vs 21.6%), including arthralgia (13.5% vs 1.4% pooled data). 
The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. There is no clear trend concerning severe AEs 
since the severe AEs were widely distributed with only 1 or 2 patients per each AE Preferred Term (PT).  
According to the Applicant, severe AEs were reported more frequently in the SAT group compared with 
the PCB group (PCB: 10.99 events/100PY; SAT: 21.68 events/100PY) in the pooled phase III studies in 
the  DB  period.  Among  severe  AEs,  psychiatric  AEs  were  reported  only  in  treatment  arm,  one  suicide 
attempt (study BN40898) and 3 patients with AEs under SOC of psychiatric disorders including 2 cases 
with depression and 2 with changed mental status (study BN40900). 
The overall incidence of severe AEs (17.69 events/100PY) and rates of severe AEs by PT for all patients 
treated with satralizumab during the Overall SA237 period remained similar to the rates reported in the 
DB period.

Adverse events of special interest 
Infection 
The incidence rates of infectious AEs were higher in both treatment arms, with a slightly higher incidence 
in the SAT treated group than PCB (BN40898: 68.3% vs 61.9% and BN40900 54% vs 43.8%). A higher 
proportion of patients reported severe infectious AEs in SAT treatment arm (9.5%, 6.08 events/100PY) 
compared to PCB (3.1%, 2.46 events/100PY) in the BN40900 study. 
The  incidence  of  serious  infection  AEs  under  the  basket  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  were 
numerically higher in SAT treated group vs PCB (5.68 AE/100PY vs 4 AE /100 patient years) including 
bronchitis (3.61AE/100PY vs 3 AE/100PY), pneumonia (1.55 AE/100PY vs 0 AE/100PY) and pulmonary 
sepsis (0.52AE/100PY vs 0 AE/100PY).

Injection-related reactions 
In the pooled DB Period, 7 patients (9.5%) in the PCB group reported 9 IRRs (8.99 events/100PY) and 
14 patients (13.5%) in the SAT group reported 36 IRR events (18.58 events/100PY). 
Local IRRs: 6 events in 5 patients in the PCB group and 18 events in 8 patients in the SAT group, no 
IRRs were serious, and none led to discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal. 
Systemic IRRs: 3 events in 3 patients in the PCB group and 17 events in 6 patients in the SAT group. 
Symptoms associated with systemic IRRs were headache (6 events in 2 patients), nausea (3 events in 
1 patient), diarrhoea (3 events in 2 patients), vertigo (2 events in 1 patient), and single event of chills, 
hypertension, pyrexia, micturition urgency, vision blurred, and diastolic hypotension. 
All systemic IRR were of mild intensity except for one case of hypertension in the SAT group in study 
BN40898 and 2 events of vertigo reported as severe in  Study BN40900. All events resolved, except 1 
mild systemic IRR of blurred vision assessed by the investigator as unrelated to satralizumab. 
Anaphylaxis 
No  anaphylactic  reactions  to  satralizumab  identified  by  the  Standard  MedDRA  Query  Anaphylactic 
reactions were reported. The potential cases suspected by using Sampson's criteria were not considered 
anaphylactic reactions. 
Depression and Suicidality 
At  baseline,  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  SAT  group  compared  to  the  PCB  group  reported 
suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  (PCB:  6.8%,  SAT:  20.2%).  Post-baseline,  the  proportion  of  patients 
reporting any suicidal ideation was similar between the treatment groups (PCB: 4.1%, SAT: 4.8%) during 
the  DB  period.  No  self-injurious  behaviours  without  suicidal  intent  were  reported  post-baseline  (at 
baseline, PCB: 0, SAT: 2 patients [1.9%]). 
No additional post-baseline suicidal ideation, behaviour  or  self-injurious behaviour without  intent  was 
captured on  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  in the  Overall SA237 period  up  to  clinical cut-off 
date (CCOD). 
The incidences rates of depression reported in the phase III studies during the DB period is higher in 
SAT than in PCB (6.7% vs 2.7%).  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
AEs  reported in 37% of  patients in  group by  SOC  gastrointestinal. A higher frequency  of  nausea  was 
reported in the SAT group than PCB (13.5 % vs 6.8%, Table 33).  
Gastritis was reported in 4 patients (3.8%) in SAT group but none in the PCB. 
Malignancies 
Three different types of malignancies were reported in 3 patients.  Two were in the PCB, one event of 
squamous cell carcinoma in the SAT group was judged as not related to the study drug.   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported. 
Study BN40898: In the DB period, 9 patients (21.4%) in the PCB group and 7 patients (17.1%) in the 
SAT group experienced at least one SAE (Table 38). 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021

Study BN40900: In the DB period, 5 patients (15.6%) in the PCB group and 12 patients (19.0%) in the 
SAT group experienced at least one SAE (Table 39). 
The most commonly reported SAEs in the SAT group were under the SOC Infections and Infestations (in 
both phase III studies), Injury and Poisoning and Procedural Complications (in the study BN 40898) and 
Psychiatric disorders (in the study BN 40900). In other SOCs, SAEs were reported in 1-2 patients in the 
SAT group (Table 38 and Table 39).

Laboratory findings 
Neutrophils, leukocytes and white blood cell count  
In the pooled data during the DB period, a higher proportion of patients in the SAT group had at least 
one post-baseline neutrophil count decrease resulting in a shift from baseline to a higher (worse) grade, 
compared to the patients in the PCB group (SAT vs PCB: 31.7% vs 21.6%). The proportion of patients 
who had a post-baseline shift to grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil counts was also higher in the SAT 
group than in the PCB group (10 of 104 patients, 9.6% vs 4 of 74, 5.4%). The trend was similar in the 
overall SA237 period and the individual studies. 
In the pooled phase III studies during the DB period, a higher proportion of patients in the SAT group 
had at least one post-baseline leukocyte count decrease resulting in a shift from baseline to a higher 
(worse) grade, compared to the patients with shifts in the PCB group (SAT vs PCB: 54.8% vs 28.4%). 
The proportion of patients who had  a post-baseline shift to not low to grade 3  decrease  in leukocyte  
counts was also higher in the SAT group than in the placebo group (5 of 104 patients, 5.6 % vs 0).  
The trend was similar in the overall SA237 period and the individual phase III studies. 
Platelets 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 108/132 
 
 
  
  
 
In the pooled data, during the DB period, a higher proportion of patients in the SAT group had at least 
one post-baseline platelet count decrease resulting in a shift from baseline to a higher (worse) grade, 
compared to the patients with shifts in the PCB group (SAT vs PCB: 24% vs 9.5%). Most of the patients 
had platelet count decreases with shifts to grade 1, with 2 of 104 patients (1.9%) in SAT group with 
levels shifting to a decreased count of grade 2.  
No patient had grade 3 or grade 4 decrease in platelet counts. 
Liver enzymes and total bilirubin 
In the pooled data during the DB period, there was a higher proportion of patients in the SAT group that 
had  post-baseline  ALT  increases  (29  of  104  patients  [27.9%])  or  AST  increases  (19  of  104  patients 
[18.3%]) resulting in a shift from  baseline  to  higher (worse)  grade, compared with the patients with 
shifts in grades in the PCB group (ALT: 9 of 74 patients [12.2%]; AST: 10 of 74 patients [13.5%]). 
Most ALT or AST increases were transient and grade 1-2, resolving with ongoing satralizumab treatment. 
Post-baseline transaminase increases above grade 1 (>3 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 5 
(4.8%)  in the SAT group. The highest Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) grade 
ALT elevation was a grade 3 event (5.3 x ULN) in one patient treated with satralizumab during the DB 
period in Study BN40898, leading to withdrawal at week 4. One additional patient in the study had a 
post-baseline shift to grade 3 AST increase (8.8 x ULN) and a post-baseline shift to grade 3 ALT increase 
(11.7x ULN) in the OLE period and withdrew from the study due to lack of effect. Elevated ALT and AST 
returned  back  to  baseline  levels  in  both  patients  after  discontinuation  of  satralizumab.  None  of  the 
patients with grade 3 elevations in transaminases had elevated bilirubin during the study. 
During  the  DB  period,  3  patients  in  the  SAT  group  had  a  post-baseline  shift  to  grade  2  increase  in 
bilirubin, and one additional patient in the overall SA237 period, but none with a post-baseline grade 3-
4 increase.  
Lipid  
During the DB period, the patients in the SAT group had at least one post-baseline increase in cholesterol 
resulting in a shift from baseline to a higher (worse) grade in 44 of 104 patients [42.3%] whereas in 25 
of 74 patients [33.8%] in the PCB group. None had a post-baseline grade 3-4 increase in cholesterol. A 
higher proportion of patients in the SAT group had a post-baseline increase in cholesterol resulting in a 
shift  above  Grade  1  (>  7.75  mmol/L)  compared  with  patients  in  the  PCB  group  (11  of  104  patients 
[10.6% vs 1 of 74 patients [1.4%]). 
During  the  DB  period,  66  of  104  patients  [63.5%]  in  the  SAT  group  had  a  post-baseline  triglyceride 
increase resulting in a shift from baseline to higher (worse) grades in comparison with 36 of 74 patients 
[48.6%] in the PCB group.  
Fibrinogen 
In the pooled analysis, there was a higher incidence of patients in the SAT group with a post-baseline 
fibrinogen level decreases resulting in a shift from baseline to a higher (worse) grade (total 74 of 104 
patients, 71.2%; shift from not low to grade 2 in 46.6%) compared with patients with in the PCB group 
(total, 15 of 74 patients, 20.3%; shift from not low to grade 2 in 4.2%). The trend in fibrinogen levels 
appeared uniform in the overall SAT treatment period. 
Complement 
A decline in mean C3, C4, and CH50 values was observed as early as the first post-baseline assessment 
at week 2 in the SAT group during the DB period in each study, and thereafter the mean values remained 
stable.  
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 109/132 
 
 
  
  
In pooled data, during the DB period, the proportion of patients with ‘not low’ baseline values shifting to 
low post-baseline C3, C4 and CH50 values was higher in the SAT group compared to the PCB group as 
early as at week 2 (C3: 7.9% PCB vs 36.2% SAT; C4: 1.4% PCB vs 32.0% SAT; and CH50: 1.8% PCB 
vs 33.3% SAT). This trend was apparent throughout the DB period and uniform in the overall SA237 
period. 
Vital Signs 
During the DB period, more patients in the SAT group (41.3%) compared to the PCB group (18.9%) had 
post-baseline value(s) of systolic blood pressure (SBP)> 140 mmHg. There was also an imbalance at 
baseline (12.5% of patients in the SAT group and 2.7% of patients in PCB group had baseline SBP > 140 
mmHg). There was an unexpected increased incidence of bradycardia in association with vital sign check 
(post-baseline pulse rate <60 in 32.7% in SAT group vs 20.3% in PCB group). 
ECG 
Abnormal  ECG  findings  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the  SAT  treated  group  than  PCB  in  study 
BN40898 (46.9% vs 17.9%), with no baseline imbalance, particularly those of RR and QTcF intervals. Of 
these, abnormal QTcF interval has appeared more common in patients on satralizumab than in those on 
PCB group during the DB phase (17.8 vs. 7.3 %) in the pool data, albeit that the major difference is in 
the mildest prolongation (450-480) and the differences have not been considered clinically significant.  
The  two  cases  described  as  clinically  significant,  one  case  of  bradycardia  and  one  of  nodal  rhythm, 
resolved without changes in the treatment regimen. 
Safety in special populations 
In  the  Phase  III  studies,  the  proportion  of  APQ4-IgG  seronegative  patients  was  approximately  the 
intended  30%  (AQP4-IgG  seropositive:  119  patients;  AQP4-IgG  seronegative:  59  patients).  A  higher 
incidence  of  infections  in  the  SAT  group  in  AQP4-IgG  seronegative  patients  (135.70  AEs/100PY) 
compared with the PCB groups (125.94 AEs/100Py) was not consistently observed across studies. The 
incidence of infections in the SAT group (102.62 AEs /100PY) was lower than the  PCB group (173.24 
AEs/100PY) in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients. 
A total of 7 adolescent patients (defined as 12-17 years of age, N=4 in SAT group), representing 3.9% 
of the total number of patients in the pooled population, were enrolled in the study BN40898 prior to the 
CCOD. Five adolescent patients reported 28 AEs during the DB period. All AEs were mild or moderate 
and  resolved,  and  none  led  to  discontinued  treatment.  Five  events  experienced  by  one  patient  were 
considered related to study treatment by the investigator. 
The Applicant reported 4 patients above 65 years of age in SAT group in the pooled dataset. Additional 
6 patients reached the age of 65 during the study by CCOD. There were 29 patients aged >55 years at 
entry  (SAT:23,  PCB:6).  The  rate  of  AEs  in  the  overall  SA237  period  in  both  age  subgroups  were 
comparable to the rates reported in the SAT and  PCB groups in the DB period; however, the rates of 
SAEs, SAEs leading to dose interruption, and serious infections were numerically higher in patients aged 
>55 years compared with patients aged ≤55 years (SAE: 20.47 events/100PY vs. 10.71 events/100PY; 
SAE leading to dose interruption: 7.22 events/100PY vs. 2.54 events/100PY; serious infection AE: 7.22 
events/100PY vs. 3.10 events/100PY). 
Baseline BW: In the study BN40898, the median baseline BW of patients across groups was 58.40 kg 
(range: 39.4-140.4 kg), whereas in the study BN40900, it was 72.70 kg (range: 42.1-151.0 kg). The 
AE profile was comparable across subgroups stratified by baseline BW (median split). However, in the 
study BN40900 the patients in the SAT arm with the lowest BW (<50 kg) had a higher incidence of all 
AEs  as  well  as  serious  and  severe  AEs  compared  to  PCB  arm  (converted  to  events/100PY,  all  SAEs: 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 110/132 
 
 
  
  
1035.22 vs. 444.49; serious AEs 36.54 vs. 0; severe AEs 170.51 vs. 0). This AE profile was not observed 
in the study BN40898, and the subgroups are small.      
There are no data on the use of satralizumab in pregnant and breastfeeding women. 
Immunological events 
The incidence rates of ADA were higher in the study BN40900 than in the study BN40898 (71-72% vs 
41-52%).  
In the pooled studies during the DB period, a higher incidences of IRR were observed in ADA-positive 
patients  (7  patients,  11.3%  with  19.78  events  per  100PY)  compared  with  ADA-negative  (6  patients, 
14.3% with 13.33 events per 100PY) and in the PCB group (8.99 events per 100PY).  
During the Overall SA237 period, no difference was evident in the IRR rate between ADA-positive and 
ADA-negative subgroups. 
A higher incidence of AE leading to dose interruption were also observed in ADA-positive patients (13 
patients, 21.0% with 24.28 events per 100PY) compared with ADA-negative (10 patients, 23.8% with 
16.96 events per 100PY), most commonly due to infections 
Arthralgia  was  reported  equally  in  the  pooled  data  between  the  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative 
subgroups. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies have been performed with satralizumab. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling has been applied to explore the potential impact 
of a reduction in IL-6 levels on the expression of CYP450 enzymes. The risk of drug interaction through 
increased expression of CYP450 enzymes resulting from reduced IL-6 levels is addressed in the SmPC. 
See PK and PD Section. 
Safety of Satralizumab Prefilled Syringes 
Overall,  63  patients  with  NMO  or  NMOSD  switched  from  the  vial  formulation  to  the  PFS  with  Needle 
Safety  Device  (NSD)  during  the  OLE  period  of  the  studies.  The  majority  of  the  patients  were  female 
(87.3%, n = 55) and 4 of them were adolescents (< 18 years).  
All 63 patients were exposed to at least one dose of satralizumab supplied in PFS. with a median duration 
of exposure of 33.6 weeks. Of these, 43 patients (68.3%) reported at least one AE, the most frequently 
reported AEs being nasopharyngitis (11.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (9.5%). No new safety 
concerns of satralizumab prefilled syringes were identified. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
AEs leading to discontinuation from treatment were described for 8 cases in 7 patients. Discontinuations 
in the DB period were in the study BN40898 SAT group increased transaminases, decreased neutrophil 
count and urticaria, and in PCB group breast and hepatic cancer, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and 
neutropenia. In the study BN40900, one SAT patient discontinued treatment due to serious pneumonia, 
and one PCB patient due to systemic lupus erythematosus. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 111/132 
 
 
  
  
AEs leading to discontinuation from  treatment in  the OLE  were  in the BN40898  cases of  endocarditis 
(serious), vasculitis, and infectious enterocolitis (serious). None were reported in the study BN40900. 
The case of vasculitis was deemed mild but it has recurred and led to withdrawal.  
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience with satralizumab. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  assessment  of  satralizumab  is  based  on  data  from  two  phase  III  studies  (BN40898  and 
BN40898). In addition, data from healthy controls in phase I study (SA-001JP) and phase II study in 
patients with RA (SA-105JP) were presented. 
Even though phase III studies had different designs, patients recruited into both studies covered a broad 
spectrum of NMO and NMOSD patients in terms of presence and absence of AQP4‐IgG, including patients 
treated as add-on to background IST and on monotherapy with satralizumab. Patients in Study BN40898 
had  to  be  on  a  stable  dose  of  one  of  the  following:  azathioprine,  mycophenolate  mofetil  or  oral 
corticosteroids  alone  (for  adolescents,  the  combination  of  azathioprine  plus  oral  corticosteroids  or 
mycophenolate mofetil plus oral corticosteroids was allowed) for 8 weeks prior to baseline. Patients in 
Study BN40900 did not receive background IST. Both phase III studies were followed by OLE studies, 
which are still on-going and only limited number of patients were included in the Summary of Clinical 
Safety.  The  Applicant’s  safety  presentation  and  pooling  strategy  are  considered  acceptable  despite 
differences in terms of some features of study design, patient population, eligibility for entering the OLE 
etc. 
Safety population 
The  total  exposure  of  104  patients  treated  with  satralizumab  during  the  DB  period  (41  in  the  Study 
BN40898 and 63 in the Study BN40900) was 193.74 patient years. During the DB study period in the 
pooled data set 90 patients treated with satralizumab were exposed up to 23 weeks, 72 patients at least 
48 weeks and 48 patients at least 95 weeks. In general, the exposure to satralizumab during DB period 
in  the  pooled  data  set  is  longer  (median  93.7  weeks)  compared  to  placebo  exposure  (median  42.6 
weeks). In the overall pool, 145 patients were treated with satralizumab for a total exposure of 327.93 
PY with 134 patients for at least 1 year, 90 patients for at least 2 years and 9 patients for at least 4 
years. Six patients (8.1%) in placebo group and 4 (3.8%) patients in satralizumab group withdrew from 
treatment due to AEs during DB period. 
The pooled patient population with respect to background IST during the DB period is unbalanced with 
more  patients  in  the  placebo  group  from  the  study  BN40898  with  concomitant  IST    (42  out  of  74 
patients), while the majority of satralizumab patients are from the monotherapy study BN40900 (63 out 
of 104 patients), which needs to be taken into account when interpreting the reported AEs frequencies 
between treatment arms. 
Given the low prevalence of NMOSD, the drug exposure can be considered acceptable for the short-term 
safety assessment of satralizumab.  As for the long-term safety profile, the safety database is too limited 
for drawing conclusions for less frequent or delayed events. The OLE Studies are ongoing until product 
registration, and the percentage of patients continuing in the OLE part is high in both studies, which thus 
may be expected to provide additional safety data.  
The limited exposure of adolescents and elderly patients precludes full safety assessment. Analysis of 
AEs in the small adolescent subpopulation does not give rise to specific safety concerns related to young 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 112/132 
 
 
  
  
age. The number of elderly patients (>65) at baseline is minute, and their AE profile may not appear 
conspicuous.  
Scrutiny of subcategories by gender, BW, and BMI inevitably leads to a few very small subgroups in the 
limited safety database.  
As the majority of the NMOSD patients are females and the half of the patient population was under 39 
years of age, the population of women of childbearing age remained sizable in the target population. The 
Applicant  agrees  to  include  use  in  pregnant  and  breastfeeding  women  as  missing  information  in  the 
Satralizumab risk management plan (RMP).  The  Applicant  proposal of conducting  a global single-arm 
pregnancy  safety  study  to  collect  information  for  10  years  on  pregnancy  complications  and  birth 
outcomes in women exposed to satralizumab during pregnancy in patients with NMOSD is agreed.  
Safety profile and specific AEs of interest 
As a humanized monoclonal antibody, satralizumab is expected to manifest class effects such as immune 
responses: post-infusion responses, antibody formation, as well as increased susceptibility to infections 
due to its mechanism of action; the production of IL-6 and sIL-6R is stimulated by pathogenic bacterial 
lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides with an activating effect on the innate immunological response, and 
consequently,  satralizumab  is  expected  to  have  an  immunosuppressive  effect  on  the  immunity  to 
bacterial  and  viral  infections.  Upon  request,  the  Applicant  accepted to  include  serious  infection  as  an 
important identified risk in the RMP.  
Most patients included in the DB period of phase 3 studies reported AEs: in the SAT group (91.3%) and 
in the placebo group (86.5%), the majority  of  mild or moderate intensity. Severe AEs  were reported 
more frequently in the SAT group compared to the PCB group.  
In general, the AE rate was largely similar between SAT and PCB arms in individual studies as well as in 
the  pooled  safety  dataset  during  DB  period  for  severe  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  or  dose 
interruption or reduction. The safety profile, in light of the available data, may be considered expected.  
ADA were detected in over half of patients in the SAT group during the DB period and in almost 2/3 of 
patients  during  the  OLE  period.  Though  incidence  of  IRRs  in  ADA-positive  population  (11.3%,  19.79 
events  per  100PY)  was  slightly  higher  than  the  ADA-negative  population  (14.3%,  13.33  events  per 
100PY), when comparing the rate of IRRs by ADA status around the time of IRRs (i.e. before, after and 
at the same time of an IRR), they were comparable: 15.26 events per 100 PY during ADA-positive periods 
compared  with  17.50  events  per  100  PY  during  ADA-negative  periods),  which  suggested  a  lack  of 
correlation between the ADA presence and IRRs  
The Applicant has provided an account of the complement factors (C3, C4, CH50) in relation to infections, 
confirming that lowering of complement levels with a potential effect does occur but has in most cases 
remained  reasonably  modest,  i.e.  mild  or  moderate.  The  low  number  of  patients  with  considerably 
lowered complement components leads to an analysis with very small numbers which calls for caution 
in the interpretations, which may also be hampered by an unexpectedly high incidences in the placebo 
groups. Several cases of expected severe infections such as pneumonia and sepsis have been associated 
with only mildly decreased or even normal complement values. The Applicant did not consider C3 levels 
monitoring  based on the justification  that  monitoring  of  the  C3  levels  will  cause  additional  burden to 
patients without prediction of appearance of infection. This position is considered acceptable.  
The laboratory abnormalities have been discussed during the procedure, and the Applicant has agreed 
to  list  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  increase  of  liver  enzymes,  hyperbilirubinemia  and 
hyperlipidaemia as ADR. Data-driven dose modification in case of thrombocytopenia suggested by the 
Applicant  -  if  the  platelet  count  is  below  75  x109/L  and  confirmed  by  repeat  testing,  dose  should  be 
interrupted until platelet count ≥ 75 x109/L, - is considered acceptable. 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 113/132 
 
 
  
  
It is notable that gastritis is reported as an AE practically solely on-treatment (up to 10.8% in the study 
BN40898). Thus, addition of gastritis as an ADR is endorsed. 
Vital signs, ECG, and other concerns 
The  somewhat  unexpected  finding  of  more  frequent  cardiac  abnormalities  seems  to  involve  some 
lengthening  of  QTcF  and  RR  intervals.  Also,  in  association  with  the  vital  sign  check,  bradycardia  was 
observed in the SAT group; together with the two cases of bradyarrhythmia deemed clinically significant, 
incorporation of bradycardia as an ADR is acceptable.     
The  Applicant has  corrected  an  erroneous  double  entry  of  subjects  with  systolic hypertensive  values, 
making a point of the potentially beneficial impact that an anti-inflammatory treatment could have in 
terms of hypertension through effectors of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, whereas noting 
that  no  support  to  a  possible  causal  link  with  a  hypertensive  effect  is  given  by  a  literature  review. 
However,  especially  the  study  BN40900  and  the  pooled  data  indicate  that  abnormal  systolic  blood 
pressure is overrepresented in the SAT group post-baseline, not explained by the slight imbalance at 
baseline. This warrants inclusion of hypertension as an ADR.  
Additionally, recognition of the major cardiovascular event risk as a potential risk in susceptible patient 
population  is  supported  not  only  by  the  hyperlipidaemic  and  hypertensive  effect  but  also  by  the 
preliminary  finding  on  the  proarrhythmic  properties.  The  Applicant  accepts  to  include  major 
cardiovascular event as an important potential risk in the Satralizumab RMP. 
The primarily noted apparent discrepancy in lifetime suicidal ideation was elicited by the used form of 
The  Columbia  Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale.  Nevertheless,  all  recruited  patients  have  fulfilled  the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria including the required absence of active suicidal ideation within 6 months 
prior to screening or attempted suicide within the last three years before screening, according to the 
Applicant, and consequently the finding is accepted as chance variation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database of satralizumab is expectedly limited both in terms of numbers and duration of the 
exposure.  The  challenge  of  identifying  AEs  is  obvious,  especially  concerning  special  subpopulations. 
Consequently, specific weight should be given to ADRs that may be interpreted as class effects of anti-
IL6R antibodies on the basis of available, larger safety databases, even if the evidence produced during 
the  clinical  development  program  of  satralizumab  may  not  appear  quite  as  solid  or  compelling.  The 
surfaced safety aspects have not given rise to major objections, and most relevant ADRs are observed 
in the SmPC.  
The  OLE  studies  are  ongoing  with  a  relatively  high  percentage  of  patients  continuing,  so  that  some 
additional longer-term safety data may be expected to be submitted by the Applicant within due time.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the Applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The Applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 01.06.2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The Applicant declared that satralizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers satralizumab to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Enspryng (satralizumab) is included in the 
additional  monitoring  list  as  it  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NMO and NMOSD are autoimmune inflammatory disorders of the CNS, predominantly targeting the spinal 
cord  and  optic nerve  but also  the  brain.  They  often  lead  to  substantial  neurological  disability,  mainly 
through relapses, and an increased mortality. The  reported incidence  rates range is 0.07-0.079: 100 
000 and the prevalence 1.04-1.09: 100 000. 
Serum AQP4-IgG, a highly disease-specific feature, are present in 70-80% of patients. IL-6 seems to 
have a central mediating role in the immunopathogenesis of NMO/NMOSD. After the first attack, patients 
with  NMOSD  experience  unpredictable  relapses  that  may  lead  to  permanent  and  accumulating 
neurological  damage  and  disability.  The  clinical  symptoms  include  visual  and  mobility  impairment, 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 119/132 
 
 
  
  
(including  blindness),  impaired  mobility,  sensory  disturbances  and,  neuropathic  pain,  and  bowel  and 
bladder dysfunction. Accordingly, relapse prevention remains the primary therapeutic goal in patients 
with NMO and NMOSD, and the key endpoints would thus be time to relapses or relapse rate over time 
as well as measures of clinical disability. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment of NMO/NMOSD consists of treatment of acute relapses (usually corticosteroids or plasma 
exchange), prevention of relapses, symptom management, and rehabilitation. Prevention is of primary 
importance, and immunosuppressants are a rational treatment option. Consensus treatment regimens 
have been published and are widely used throughout the world with apparent clinical benefit, but the 
evidence has been scanty to support the long  used treatment options (e.g. retrospective case series for 
azathioprine and prednisone, and methotrexate, as well as small prospective series for mitoxantrone and 
rituximab), so there has been an unmet medical need for therapy over the years.    
The first approved treatment for adults with AQP4-IgG antibody-positive NMO/NMOSD appeared on the 
market in 2019 (eculizumab).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal study BN40898 
Primary efficacy endpoint: time to protocol-defined relapse through the DB period 
An analysis using the stratified log-rank test showed that treatment with satralizumab in in the original 
ITT  population  led  to  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  HR  of  experiencing  a  protocol-defined 
relapse compared to placebo HR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.88, p=0.0184. The corresponding result in the 
subgroup of AQP4-IgG seropositive patients was HR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06-0.75, p=0.0086).  
Consistently with this finding, the number of patients given rescue therapy was higher in the  PCB arm 
(64%) in comparison to the SAT arm (41%). 
Sensitivity analyses (treated clinical relapse and clinical relapse) did not reach statistical significance but 
showed  a  consistent  trend  of  lower  HRs  0.57  and  053  respectively.  Similar  results  were  yielded  in 
analyses  only  including  AQP4-IgG  seropositive  patients,  HR  0.55  and  0.51  respectively.  Additional 
sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  included  relapses  treated  with  rescue  treatment 
with the PDRs as  well as  rescue treated relapses and increase in baseline medication with the PDRs. 
These yielded HRs and 95% CIs of 0.51 (0.24, 1.10) and 0.55 (0.26, 1.14) respectively.

Pivotal study BN40900 
Primary efficacy endpoint: time to protocol-defined relapse through the DB period 
An analysis using the stratified log-rank test showed that treatment with satralizumab led to a statistically 
significant 62% reduction in the risk of experiencing a protocol-defined relapse compared to placebo, 
HR: 0.38, 95% CI 0.16, 0.88 in the original ITT population. Re-analysing the primary efficacy endpoint 
only including AQP4-IgG seropositive patents yielded HR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63, p-value 0.0014. 
Consistently with this finding, the number of patients given rescue therapy was higher in the PCB arm 
(62%) in comparison to the SAT arm (32%). 
Sensitivity analyses (treated clinical relapse and clinical relapse) showed HRs 0.31 and 0.51 respectively. 
Additional sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint performed in the AQP4-IgG seropositive 
patients included relapses treated with rescue treatment with the PDRs as well as rescue treated relapses 
and increase in baseline medication with the PDRs. These yielded HRs and 95% CIs of 0.37 (0.18, 0,79) 
for both analyses (in this study patients were not censored if in need of rescue treatment or increase in 
baseline treatment).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A key consideration for the possibility to evaluate the efficacy are the concerns regarding the conduct of 
the  trials  and  thereby  the  reliability  of  the  data.  It  is  difficult  to  firmly  conclude  that  the  performed 
calculations on primary efficacy endpoint using fibrinogen data would not have resulted in loss of control 
of type 1 error which questions the robustness of the results as well as trial integrity of study BN40900. 
Further,  for  both  studies,  the  GCP  inspections  raised  concerns  about  the  effective  the  segregation  of 
treating  and  examining  investigators  and  in  the  implementation  of  the  review  of  the  CEC  package 
(including queries sent to the investigators) performed by the Sponsor before sending it to the CEC. 
The positive primary efficacy outcome is supported by the finding of a similar effect size in each pivotal 
trial,  even  despite  the  differences  between  the  study  populations  (add-on  vs.  monotherapy; 
demographical, geographical and racial variability). The sensitivity analyses are sufficiently consistent 
not  to  overshadow  the  main  result  but  provide  some  additional  support  despite  not  often  reaching 
statistical  significance.  However,  the  disparity  between  physician  diagnosed  and  protocol-defined 
relapses casts some doubt on the effect size of the medicinal product in real life. Whereas the definition 
of relapse is endorsed as “true relapses” and they are more likely to be detected, clinical relapses may 
arguably be considered more relevant events. Further, when relapses needing rescue therapy or change 
in  baseline  medication  were  accounted  as  events  instead  of  leading  to  censoring  in  study  BN40898, 
efficacy was no longer significant.  
The complete lack of effect for the key secondary outcome endpoints may be due to low baseline values 
and improper timepoints fore measurement, resulting in data collected only from relapse free patients. 
Nevertheless,  this  leaves  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  without  support  from  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints.  
Albeit that the heterogeneity of the study populations may increase the representativeness of the whole 
cohort by including more of the real-life variability of the NMOSD spectrum, it also creates additional 
subgrouping, which leads to comparisons for which the studies are not statistically powered. There were 
only four patients 65 years or older when entering the pivotal studies. Six additional patients reached 
the age of 65 years during the study period. To enable some analyses, the Applicant used all patients 
age  >  55  years  at  screening.  In  the  two  pivotal  trials  24  AQP4  seropositive  patients  (5  treated  with 
placebo,  19  with  satralizumab)  aged  >  55  years  were  included.  In  these,  there  were  4  PDRs  (1  in 
satralizumab) and 6 rescue treated relapses (all in satralizumab). Due to few patients and events any 
firm conclusion is difficult to draw, but a similar trend is observed in patients aged over 55 years as in 
younger patients. The seeming lack of efficacy in patients with African/African American ancestry may 
be explained by small samples and chance variation.  
Exposure-efficacy  analyses,  efficacy  and  PK  data  together  initially  suggested  that  the  variability  of 
exposure in different groups may have a bearing on effect, leaving a possibility of a low-exposure group. 
This issue has been properly addressed by the Applicant, alas, no specific subgroup has been identified. 
Since  the  exposure/efficacy  analysis  has  been  performed  in  a  biased  dataset  containing  AQP4-IgG 
seronegative  patients,  no  conclusions  on  the  adequacy  of  the  dose  could  be  drawn  initially.  A  new 
exposure/efficacy analysis in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients only indicates that satralizumab seems to 
have an effect on TFR1 when compared to placebo. There was however no significant difference between 
satralizumab exposure groups. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following most frequently reported AEs were identified as ADRs in patients treated with satralizumab 
in the pooled data of the two phase 3 trials: arthralgia (13.5%); headache (19.2%); migraine (3.8%); 
musculoskeletal stiffness (4.8%); insomnia (5.8%); IRR (12.5%); peripheral oedema (4.8%); pruritus 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 122/132 
 
 
  
  
(5.8%); rash (8.7%); allergic rhinitis (3.8%); hypofibrinogenaemia (2.9%).  All these ADRs has been 
reported in drugs of the same pharmacological class. 
According to the IRR listing presented by the Applicant, the IRR events per 100 patient years were higher 
in in the SAT group (36 events, 18.58%) than PCB (9 events, 8.99%), in both systemic IRRs (SAT vs 
PCB: 9.29% vs 3%) and Local IRRs (SAT vs PCB: 9.81% vs 5.99%). 
In addition, based on the assessment safety data, ADRs reported in the same drug class and mechanical 
plausibility,  the  following  adverse  events  are  also  considered  as  unfavourable  effects  associated  with 
satralizumab treatment: 
• 
Infections, reported by 59.6% of patients on SAT vs 54.1% of patients on PCB. Upper respiratory 
tract infection (19.2%vs 16.2%), nasopharyngitis (18.3% vs 10.8%) and urinary tract infection 
(17.3% vs 20.3%) were the most frequently reported infections. There is some indications that 
serious infections, which were few, may be more common in patients treated with satralizumab 
as well as in patients with lower complement levels, suggesting a higher risk.   
• 
Leukopenia and neutropenia: A higher proportion of patients in the SAT group had at least one 
post-baseline  leukocyte  count  decrease  (SAT  vs  PCB:  54.8%  vs  28.4%)  or  neutrophil  count 
decrease (SAT vs PCB: 31.7% vs 21.6%). The proportion of patients who had  a post-baseline 
shift to Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil counts was also higher in the SAT group (SAT: 9.6% 
vs. PCB: 5.4%). 
• 
Thrombocytopenia:  A  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  SAT  group  had  at  least  one  post-
baseline platelet count decrease resulting in a shift from baseline to a worse grade (SAT vs PCB: 
24% vs 9.5%). 
• 
Elevation  of  transaminases:  A  higher  incidence  of  patients  in  the  SAT  group  that  had  post-
baseline  ALT  and  AST  increases  (27.9%  and  18.3%,  respectively)  than  in  PCB  (12.2%  and 
13.5%, respectively). One case of very high increase (8.8-11.7 x ULN) with positive de-challenge 
with SAT suggesting a possible causal relationship.  
• 
Elevated  lipids  levels:  A  higher  incidence  of  patients  in  the  SAT  group  had  a  post-baseline 
increase  in  cholesterol  levels  resulting  in  grade  shift  (SAT:  20.2%  vs  PCB:10.8%);  a  similar 
increase triglyceride levels (SAT:63.5% vs PCB: 48.6%).  
•  Hypofibrinogenemia: A higher incidence of patients in the SAT groups who had a post-baseline 
fibrinogen level decreases resulting in a shift from baseline to a worse grade (SAT: 71.2% vs. 
PCB:20.3%).  
•  Bradyarrhythmic effect: post-baseline pulse rate <60 in 32.7% in SAT group vs 20.3% in PCB 
group. 
• 
Formation of ADA: ADA were detected in 59.6% patients in SAT group during DB period and in 
63.45% (of 145 patients) treated with satralizumab during the OLE period.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The major expected unfavourable effects, serious infections and hypersensitivity, have not been given 
very substantial support by the collected data; however, this is to large extent due to the very restricted 
safety database and the limited duration of exposure. Even more so, the cardiovascular effects, apart 
from the potential bradyarrhythmic effect, are not directly supported by ADR observations. However, the 
convergent findings of laboratory parameters and the observations together with the knowledge of the 
pharmacological mechanism and similar pharmacological agents point out the risk of major unfavourable 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 123/132 
 
 
  
  
effects  that  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  in  clinical  practice  as  well  as  in  measures  of 
pharmacovigilance.  
The haematological effects, leuko-, neutro- and thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia, as well as 
the  potential  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  are  evident,  although  the  most  serious  manifestations  were  not 
encountered, and so appears the effect on cholesterol and triglycerides, although their long-term course, 
and effects are not known.  
The exposure of pregnant women is an obvious risk with missing data, which must not be overlooked in 
this  patient  population  but  deserves  further  discussion  on  the  options  of  data  collection;  as  well,  the 
potential risk of malignancy has not received support by data but obviously requires sizable long-term 
data to be assessable.  
A definite source of uncertainty in the assessment of risks is the variability of the study population. To 
be  representative,  the  inclusion  needs  to  be  broad-based,  and  the  downside  is  the  subdivision  into 
variable and often very small subgroups. This is exemplified by this study population, which does not 
allow  in-depth  subgroup  analyses.  Consequently,  all  inferences  as  to  the  unfavourable  effects 
characteristic of special subpopulations such as adolescents or the elderly remain very preliminary, and 
the  risk  of  not  uncovering  these  problems  at  all  is  substantial  and  makes  a  very  pedantic  scrutiny 
necessary. 
The significance of ADA is not definitely known. In this dataset, their safety profiles appeared largely 
comparable.  Though  incidence  of  IRRs  in  ADA-positive  population  was  slightly  higher  than  the  ADA-
negative population, when comparing the rate of IRRs by ADA status around the time of IRRs (i.e. before, 
after and at the same time of an IRR), they were comparable.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  considerable  disability  associated  with  NMO/NMOSD  spectrum  diseases  is  known  to  accumulate 
predominantly through relapses, and in consequence, the primary aim  of therapy is their prevention. 
The chosen primary endpoint of time-to-event type does not catch all aspects of disease but is widely 
accepted and acceptable (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/712652/2014), and the studied population is considered to 
be  essentially  representative  of  the  target  population.  The  acquired  primary  effect  (HR  0.21-026)  in 
prevention of clinical relapses is considered clinically relevant and meaningful in the target population. 
However, the disparity between physician-diagnosed and protocol-defined relapses casts some doubt on 
the effect size of the medicinal product in real life. Whereas the definition of relapse is endorsed as “true 
relapses” and they are more likely to be detected, the clinical relapses may arguably be considered more 
relevant events. 
There is a lack of support of efficacy by the key secondary endpoints associated with clinical symptoms 
and well-being, albeit that the time period of 24 weeks may not be long for an effect in symptoms such 
as pain and fatigue, which may be slower-evolving and have many determinants. The timepoints used 
for measurement of secondary endpoints resulted in data only from relapse free patients. Further, scores 
were low at randomisation, leaving little opportunity for further reductions in these endpoints. The lack 
of observed effect in secondary endpoints may not undermine the primary outcome, but still do not lend 
any support to it.  
Efficacy data derived from adolescents included in the pivotal trials are too scarce to draw any conclusion 
on  efficacy  in  this  subpopulation.  However,  bibliographic  data  points  to  essential  similarity  between 
paediatric  and  adult  disease.  The  currently  accepted  view  is  that  immunopathological  mechanisms 
underlying  lesion  formation  are  comparable  across  all  ages,  particularly  in  AQP4-IgG  seropositive 
patients  (Branwell  et  al,  2008)  which  is  currently  the  relevant  NMOSD  subpopulation  in  question  for 
marketing authorisation. PK data are similar in adolescents and adults. Thus, extrapolation of efficacy 
from adults to adolescents seems reasonable. Data in elderly people are very sparse. However, a similar 
trend with respect to efficacy is observed in patients aged over 55 years as in younger patients. 
A key consideration for the possibility to evaluate the benefit-risk balance are the concerns regarding 
the conduct of the trials and thereby the reliability of the data. 
Even if it cannot be completely rule out that that the calculations of HR early during the conduct of the 
study using fibrinogen level were not considered when deciding the protocol amendments number 6 and 
8,  it  is  acknowledged that  no  introduction  of  bias  could  be detected  in  the  separate bias  assessment 
report submitted by the Applicant. This is a remaining uncertainty, but it is not considered to have had 
a  major  impact  on  the  overall  results  of  the  pivotal  studies.  With  respect  to  the  inspection  findings 
associated  with  the  difficulty  to  effectively  confirm  the  segregation  of  the  examining  and  treating 
investigators, although retrospectively collected data does not have the same quality assuring value as 
prospectively collected information, the separation of the roles has been confirmed in writing by site staff 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 127/132 
 
 
  
  
 
in  all  but  six  findings  (out  of  86  total  findings).  The  CHMP  concluded  that  even  if  the  documentation 
intended to ensure that the examining and treating investigators were separated in some cases was not 
optimal, there were no evidence that unblinding of the examining assessor had occurred. Finally, the 
GCP inspection team reported deficiencies in the implementation of the intermediate review of the CEC 
package  by  the  Sponsor  including  queries,  answers,  and  changes  in  the  forms  not  recorded  in  a 
systematic way to trace all events from a chronological point of view, a potentially directive query and 
numerous access to the electronic system (VCAS) used for managing relapse assessment forms. During 
the evaluation, the Applicant has acknowledged the findings and provided clarifications in writing and 
during  an  oral  explanation.  As  part  of  the  responses,  the  Applicant  performed  a  post  database-lock 
internal review to identify and assess the impact of query-related corrections to relapse documentation. 
According to the report, queries were triggered as appropriate and resulted in corrections to the forms 
when  necessary.  During  the  oral  explanation,  the  Applicant  acknowledged  the  incomplete  corrective 
action of filing the relapse packages with queries submitted as part of the responses due to technical 
limitations but confirmed that all documentation has been completed and filed in date order as requested, 
and therefore, the corrective action has been resolved. Finally, even if there were numerous accesses to 
VCAS, the Applicant reviewed the complete access listing and confirmed the access rights were given 
appropriately 
Satralizumab was generally well tolerated  by  NMO and  NMOSD  patients in the two phase III studies. 
However, the available safety data is considered very limited with no more than 145 patients with NMO 
and  NMOSD  having  been  exposed  to  satralizumab;  furthermore,  the  limited  duration  of  exposure 
precludes the assessment of any long-term risks.  
The  heterogeneity  of  the  limited  database  challenges  the  evaluation  of  safety  in  the  special 
subpopulations, such as the safety profile in adolescents (n=4, SAT group during DB period and n=7 
during OLE period) or the elderly above 65 years of age (n=4, SAT group), and no firm conclusions can 
be drawn.  
The most notable ADR were considered class effects. Serious infections, serious hypersensitivity, risk of 
liver toxicity, risk of major cardiovascular events, and exposure in pregnant and breastfeeding women 
are identified as safety concerns.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant effect of satralizumab in treatment of NMO/NMOSD spectrum disease with AQP4-IgG 
has been demonstrated in the pivotal studies. The limitations and uncertainties posed by the fibrinogen 
levels-related GCP breach as well as the findings in the GCP inspection were considered in the decision 
on the B/R but in the absence of evidence of an intentional attempt of research misconduct or factual 
unblinding, efficacy on the prevention of relapses is considered demonstrated.   
The observed safety profile of satralizumab per se does not raise any severe or unmanageable concerns; 
it is noted, however, that the conclusions are based on a very limited safety database.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Enspryng is not similar to Soliris within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 2. 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Enspryng is favourable in the following indication: 
Enspryng  is  indicated  as  a  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  immunosuppressive  therapy 
(IST)  for  the  treatment  of  neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorders  (NMOSD)  in  adult  and 
adolescent patients from 12 years of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) seropositive 
(see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal  product  subject  to  restricted  medical  prescription  (see  Annex  I:  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions  or  restrictions  with  regard  to  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of 
the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
EMA/CHMP/265568/2021 
Page 129/132 
 
 
  
  
 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
A patient alert card to address the risk(s) of serious infections: 
•  The card informs the patient that satralizumab may increase the risk of infection 
•  Patents/carers are instructed to recognise signs or symptoms of  infections and seek medical 
care from a healthcare professional 
•  The card provides a warning message for healthcare professionals treating the patient at any 
time, including in conditions of emergency, that the patient is using satralizumab 
•  Contact details of the patient’s satralizumab prescriber 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that satralizumab is a new active 
substance  as it is not a constituent of  a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0220/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 22 April 2021 
Enspryng EMEA/H/C/004788/0000 
The undersigned member(s) of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of Enspryng indicated as a monotherapy or in combination 
with  immunosuppressive  therapy  (IST)  for  the  treatment  of  neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorders 
(NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-
IgG) seropositive. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
Both the fibrinogen levels-related GCP breach and the findings recorded in the GCP inspections affecting 
both trials raise concerns over the reliability and robustness of the efficacy findings.  
1.  The efficacy data estimated using fibrinogen data may have been used in the decisions. There 
are serious concerns about the maintenance of the blinding and the effect on both studies by the 
calculation  of  HR  based  on  unblinded  fibrinogen  levels.  It  is  difficult  to  conclude  that  the 
performed calculations would not have resulted in loss of control of type 1 error which questions 
the robustness of the results as well as trial integrity of this study. 
2.  The integrated inspection report (including inspection finding from the initial sponsor (Chugai), 
the CRO (Parexel), sites in Spain and Poland) resulted in 10 critical and 19 major findings. Such 
critical issues were found in both studies and severely question the integrity of the trial data, 
such as issues concerning  
a.  a weak process for segregation of examining and treating investigators at clinical sites,  
b. 
interference in relapse assessment as there was an intermediate step of review of the 
relapse  assessment  forms  by  Sponsor  and  CRO  staff  raising  directive  queries  to 
investigator before the CEC members assessed the forms,  
c. 
innumerable, untraceable changes done on relapse assessment forms and 4) numerous 
accesses to the electronic system (VCAS) used for managing relapse assessment form.  
d.  at least 33 (28%) of patients were negatively affected in terms of data integrity. This 
seriously questions the reliability and the quality of the remaining data can be questioned 
as well. 
e.  the  post  database-lock  internal  review  performed  by  the  Applicant  to  correct  the 
deficiencies may be considered limited and does not give reassurance that  the results 
may be reliable. 
Overall, it is questioned if the data from the pivotal studies can be used for a B/R assessment and 
therefore, we consider the B/R balance as negative.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR GAZYVARO 
(OBINUTUZUMAB)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Gazyvaro.  The RMP details 
important risks of Gazyvaro, and how more information will be obtained about Gazyvaro
risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Gazyvaro summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Gazyvaro should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Gazyvaro should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Gazyvaro’s RMP.
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Gazyvaro is authorized for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(See SmPC for full indication). It contains obinutuzumab as the active substance and it is 
given by intravenous route.
Further information about the evaluation of Gazyvaro’s benefits can be found in 
Gazyvaro EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage.
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of Gazyvaro, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Gazyvaro risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report assessment,
so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Gazyvaro are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Gazyvaro.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk - Infusion related reactions
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Clinical trial data from studies BO20999, BO21000, BO21003, 
BO21004, BO21005, BO21223, GAO4753g, GAO4768g, 
GAO4779g, GAO4915g, and MO40597.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
The following specific patient characteristics were suggested 
to be potential risk factors for CLL patients who experienced 
IRRs related to obinutuzumab in Study BO21004 by the study 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in September 2011.
High tumor burden (circulating lymphocyte count 100 x109/L)
Binet stage C CLL at screening (Rai III/IV)
Low body mass index (BMI 20)
Hypertension necessitating anti-hypertensive treatment.
A risk factor analysis of the Stage 2 data from Study BO21004 
did not allow clear identification of the patients at a higher risk 
of IRRs.
Increased tumor burden is considered a risk factor for IRR. 
However, no clear effect of tumor burden (as assesses by 
circulating lymphocyte count 100109 cells/L) was seen on 
the incidence of IRRs. In the GClb arm of BO21004 (Stage 2 
analysis), there was no difference in IRR incidence based on 
tumor burden. The incidence of all grade IRRs in patients with 
high tumor burden was 67% and in patients with a low tumor 
burden, it was 66%. Similarly, the incidence of grade 3-4 IRRs 
was also comparable in patients with high and low tumor 
burden (22% vs. 19%).
The incidence of IRRs as per Binet staging at baseline was 
analyzed. The incidence of all grade IRRs was comparable in 
patients with Binet stage A and C and lower in patients with 
Binet stage B at baseline (A, B, C: 67%, 57%, 75%). A similar 
trend was seen with grade 3-4 (23%, 13%, 26%) and serious 
IRRs (11%, 8%, 12%).
The incidence of all grade and Grade 3-4 IRRs in the GClb 
arm was comparable in patients with body mass index 
(BMI)  20 and  20 (all grades 60% vs. 66% and Grade 3-4, 
20% vs. 20%). The incidence of IRRs remained the same 
irrespective of whether patients received anti-hypertensive 
treatment or not (all grade IRR, 66% vs 66%, and Grade 3-4, 
20% vs. 19%).
In addition to the analysis of risk factors proposed by the 
DSMB, an extensive risk factor analysis was also performed in 
patients who developed an IRR compared to patients who did 
not experience any IRR event based on the characteristics of 
patients at baseline. These included age, gender, BMI 
(median BMI and BMI>30), estimated creatinine clearance 
(median CrCl and CrCl< or ≥70ml/min), radiologically 
assessed sum of product of diameters for target lesions, 
circulating lymphocyte count (median lymphocyte count, 
count >25x109 cells/L and count>100x109 cells/L) and medical 
history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension and 
Important identified risk - Infusion related reactions
hypercholesterolemia. Assessment of all the above-mentioned 
potential risk factors revealed no conclusive differences in 
baseline characteristics of patients with or without IRRs.
In Study MO40597, the incidence of nature of IRRs after 
short-duration infusion at Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles in 
patients with FL was similar to that observed in patients 
receiving standard-duration infusion.

administration
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC: Special warnings and 
precautions for use
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC: Undesirable effects
Routine risk minimization activities recommending 
specific clinical measures to address the risk:
Corticosteroid premedication is recommended for patients with 
FL and mandatory for CLL patients in the first cycle. 
Premedication to reduce the risk of infusion related reactions.
Hypotension, as a symptom of IRRs, may occur during 
Gazyvaro intravenous infusions. Therefore, withholding of 
antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours 
prior to and throughout each Gazyvaro infusion and for the 
first hour after administration.
Patients who have pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary 
conditions should be monitored carefully throughout the 
infusion and the post-infusion period.
Refer to section 4.4 of the SmPC for detailed information.

Patients with CLL and NHL are predisposed to common as 
well as opportunistic infections as a result of a number of 
disease-related factors including B cell dysfunction, 
immunoglobulin deficiency, abnormal T-cell function, and 
neutropenia resulting from infiltration of the bone marrow.

No specific risk factors have been identified by Roche for non-
acute thrombocytopenia (i.e. thrombocytopenia occurring 
more than 24 hours after obinutuzumab infusion). However, 
possible risk factors for acute thrombocytopenia (based on the 
published rituximab literature), may be high tumor burden, 
bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly and histological 
subtypes of mantle cell lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia. In 
general, patients with CLL appear to be more at risk of 
thrombocytopenia than NHL patients.
Routine risk communication:
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC: Special warnings and 
precautions for use
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC: Undesirable effects
Routine risk minimization activities recommending 
specific clinical measures to address the risk:
Patients should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, 
especially during the first cycle; regular laboratory tests should 
be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should 
be considered in case of severe or life-threatening 
thrombocytopenia.

The incidence of CLL and NHL rises markedly with age. 
Similarly, cardiac events such as heart failure are primarily 
diseases of aging, with 75% of existing and new cases 
occurring in individuals over 65 years of age. Concomitant 
chemotherapy (for example bendamustine and 
cyclophosphamide) and radiation are also associated with 
cardiac effects.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
CLL and FL may transform into an aggressive large-cell 
lymphoma (called Richter's transformation in CLL) or 
prolymphocytic leukemia. In addition, patients treated for CLL 
and NHL can develop therapy-related myelodysplastic 
syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with CLL and 
NHL may also have a higher risk of developing secondary 
solid tumors. Exposure to genotoxic agents such as alkylating 
agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and radiation are particularly 
relevant for patients with NHL or CLL.

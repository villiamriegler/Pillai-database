2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
In combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated CLL. 
Epidemiology  
CLL is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an accumulation of monoclonal mature B-
cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs. It is the most common form of adult 
leukemia in the Western world. An exponential increase in the incidence of CLL with age is observed; 
the median age at diagnosis is 72 years of age.  
Biologic features 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B-cells (CD5+CD23+) in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary 
lymph organs. Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is a condition possessing similar characteristics but 
without lymphocytosis and is essentially a variant of the same underlying disorder as CLL. Clinically, 
these similar pathologies constitute one distinct disease collectively referred to as CLL hereafter 
(Muller-Hermelink 2001).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
An exponential increase in the incidence of CLL with age is observed; the median age at diagnosis is 
72 years of age (Molica 2013).  
Diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood (Hallek 2013). It 
is the most common form of adult leukemia in the Western world; worldwide, there are approximately 
191,000 cases and 61,000 deaths per year attributed to CLL (Global Burden of Disease Cancer 
Collaboration 2017).  
The clinical course for CLL is associated with diminished bone marrow function, which is a hallmark of 
leukemia. Assessment of newly diagnosed patients for deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 
(del 17p), del 11q, mutated TP53, and IGHV mutational status has prognostic and predictive value; 
specifically shorter PFS and OS have been reported in patients with high-risk genomic features when 
treated with conventional chemoimmunotherapy regimens that include alkylating drugs or purine 
analogues (Bulian 2012; Byrd 2006; Fink 2013; Zenz 2012). In particular, patients with the del 17p 
abnormality have an increased risk of relapse and death; the median life expectancy is 2 to 3 years 
from first-line treatment (Eichhorst 2011; Ghielmini 2013; Stilgenbauer 2010). The recently updated 
2018 International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) guidelines (Hallek 2018) emphasize the importance of 
testing for these high-risk genomic features, and results should guide therapeutic decisions in clinical 
practice (Hallek 2018; Kipps 2017).

Management 
A representative summary of first-line treatments approved for patients with CLL in the EU is shown in 
Table 1. Approved agents from 4 different classes are available for the frontline treatment of patients 
with CLL; these include tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (eg, ibrutinib), alkylating agents (eg, chlorambucil, 
bendamustine, cyclophosphamide), nucleoside analogs (eg, fludarabine), and anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibodies (eg, rituximab, obinutuzumab).  
For any given patient, an overall goal for initial therapy is to achieve a robust clinical response while 
minimizing toxicities of treatment. The choice of therapy in CLL is dependent on the patient’s physical 
ability to tolerate chemo-intensive regimens (patient age, fitness, comorbid conditions, and 
performance status are taken into consideration) and the presence of disease prognostic factors, such 
as chromosomal abnormalities, eg, 17p and 11q deletions (Eichhorst 2011; Eichhorst 2015; National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] 2019; Hallek 2018).  Treatment guidelines from the European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) indicate the choice of treatment for previously untreated patients 
with CLL is based on stage of disease, whether a patient is considered “fit”, and detection of del 17p or 
mutated TP53 (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017). 
Chemoimmunotherapies (CIT; combinations of chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents) are a mainstay of 
treatment for frontline CLL (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; NCCN 2019). 
Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the most effective CIT treatment, however it is 
associated with a high rate of hematologic toxicities, and therefore its use is limited to younger, fitter 
patients without comorbidities (ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; NCCN 2019; Hallek 2010; 
Keating 2005; Robak 2018). Phase 3 data from the CLL8 trial established FCR as the standard first-line 
therapy for young, fit patients with CLL (Hallek 2010).  Subjects received a mean 5.2 (range, 0-6) 
cycles of FCR; of patients receiving study treatment, 26% did not receive the planned 6 cycles of FCR. 
With a median time on study of 5.9 years, median PFS was 56.8 months.  Approximately 25% of 
patients were unable to tolerate FCR-based CIT, with 56% of patients experiencing Grade 3 to 4 
hematological toxicities, 25% experiencing Grade 3 to 4 infections, and 47% requiring dose reductions 
of any of the 3 drugs by more than 10% (Fischer 2016; Hallek 2010). 
By contrast, of the recommended multi-agent CIT regimens, the alkylating-agent based regimens, 
bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) and Clb+Ob, are recommended for broader groups of patients 
based on their improved safety profiles but are seemingly less efficacious than the FCR combination 
(Eichhorst 2015; ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; NCCN 2019). A need remains for chemotherapy-
free treatment options in frontline CLL with demonstrated greater efficacy and acceptable safety 
profile.  
When treated with CIT, patients with high-risk CLL characterized by del 17p, del 11q, or unmutated 
IGHV had shorter PFS and OS compared with those without these high-risk features (Thompson 2016; 
Byrd 2006). In CLL patients with high-risk genomic features (eg, del 17p or del 11q), mutated TP53, or 
unmutated IGHV, there historically were few frontline treatment options available with favorable 
outcomes and the guidelines  recommend ibrutinib-based therapy in these high-risk CLL patients 
(ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; NCCN, Version 1.2020). Phase 3 data from Study 1112 
demonstrated a significant PFS and OS benefit in patients with previously treated CLL, including 
patients with del 17p CLL treated with ibrutinib (Byrd 2014). Data from Study 1112 ultimately led to 
the regulatory approval of ibrutinib in previously treated patients with CLL in the United States (US), 
EU, and globally as well as the approval in the EU of ibrutinib in the first-line treatment of CLL in 
patients with del 17 p/mutated TP53 who are not suited for CIT (IMBRUVICA SmPC October 2014). 
Subsequently, Phase 3 data from Study 1115 led to approvals in patients with previously untreated 
CLL (see SmPC ).

The recently updated 2018 iwCLL guidelines (Hallek 2018) and NCCN guidelines (NCCN 2019), 
emphasize the importance of obtaining prognostic information using molecular genetic testing with 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify common high-risk genomic features such as 
del 11q and del 17p and sequencing to detect TP53 mutations and IGHV mutational status to inform 
treatment decisions in clinical practice. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS are similar in patients 
with CLL carrying del 17p and patients carrying a TP53 mutation in the absence of del 17p 
(Zenz 2010). The presence of adverse genomic features del 17p and del 11q, along with TP53 
mutations and unmutated IGHV clones identified by DNA sequencing, typically confer unfavorable 
outcomes (eg, shorter PFS and OS) with conventional CIT regimens used in CLL including alkylating 
drugs or purine analogues (Thompson 2016; Fink 2013; Byrd 2006). Providing patients who have 
these high-risk genomic features with effective therapy options remains an ongoing medical need.  
When historically poor prognostic genomic factors were examined in ibrutinib-treated patients in Study 
1112, Study CLL3001, and Study 1115/1116, these factors did not confer the same adverse prognosis 
for PFS (Kipps 2019).  Recent results from Study 1130 validated this and demonstrated a PFS benefit 
in a high-risk population of subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutation, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV treated 
with Ibr+Ob as compared to Clb+Ob (IMBRUVICA SmPC August 2019; Moreno 2019).  As a result of 
these positive data for patients of any age or comorbidity with newly diagnosed CLL/SLL with 
del 17p/TP53 mutation, CIT regimens are no longer recommended (ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; 
NCCN Version 1.2020).

b Used for first- and second-line treatment of CLL 
Comparative Phase 3 data for ibrutinib-based regimens and commonly used CIT regimens Clb+Ob, BR, 
and FCR have recently been reported and further demonstrate ibrutinib superiority for first-line 
treatment across the spectrum of patient age and fitness that previously guided choice of CIT.  Data 
from Study 1130 demonstrated superior PFS with Ibr+Ob compared to Clb+Ob in subjects with 
treatment-naive CLL or SLL (IMBRUVICA SmPC August 2019; Moreno 2019).  Based on these data, 
together with the results from Studies E1912 (Shanafelt 2019), and Alliance 041202 (Woyach 2018) 
demonstrating superior outcomes with ibrutinib-based treatment versus FCR and versus BR, 
respectively, ibrutinib is a preferred treatment regimen for all newly diagnosed patients with CLL/SLL 
regardless of age, fitness or comorbidities (ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; NCCN Version 1.2020).  
For newly diagnosed CLL/SLL without del 17p/TP53 mutation, preferred regimens for treatment of 
older patients with significant comorbidities are ibrutinib (Category 1) and the BCL2 inhibitor-based 
regimen venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (Category 2A), whereas previously the BR or Clb+Ob regimens 
were preferred options.  By contrast, for younger patients without significant comorbidities with the 
same CLL characteristics, ibrutinib is currently the only preferred regimen, whereas previously the FCR 
regimen was preferred.  Because FCR is not a recommended treatment for subjects with del 17p due 
to the poor response of these patients to FCR (ESMO Guidelines Committee 2017; 
NCCN Version 1.2020; NCCN Version 1.2014), subjects with del 17p CLL were excluded from Study 
E1912, in which FCR was the comparator. 
Study E1912 was conducted to evaluate whether treatment with ibrutinib in combination with 
rituximab would prolong PFS compared to the most effective CIT available, FCR, in patients ≤70 years 
of age with CLL, addressing the need for highly effective, chemotherapy-free therapies with greater 
efficacy and acceptable safety for this population. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ibrutinib is a small molecule BTK inhibitor currently approved as a single agent (European Commission 
Decision 26 May 2016) or in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated CLL (European Commission Decision 02 August 2019), and as a single agent or in 
combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who 
received at least one prior therapy (European Commission Decision 25 August 2016). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice  
Scientific advice was not requested; Study E1912 was led by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
No new data for the environmental risk assessment were provided with this application. A complete 
ERA has been provided in previous procedures and considered acceptable. The MAH has provided a 
justification statement for not submitting an ERA. The proposed modification of the existing ibrutinib 
CLL indication does not extend the target patient population, and therefore there is no increase in 
environmental exposure versus the existing approved CLL indications. The justification provided is 
acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Per the protocol, Study E1912 did not collect pharmacokinetic information; therefore, a Clinical 
Pharmacology package is not provided for this submission. In prior studies, ibrutinib exposures were 
consistent in subjects with various B-cell malignancies receiving ibrutinib monotherapy or ibrutinib in 
combination with anti-CD20 agents or chemo-immunotherapy regimens. Reference is made to prior 
information on ibrutinib in combination with rituximab from Study 1127, which showed that subjects 
with WM treated with ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg/day as monotherapy or in combination with 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 had similar exposures, and the exposures were consistent with those previously 
observed in subjects with other B-cell malignancies treated with ibrutinib at the same dose of 420 
mg/day. In Study 1127, in subjects with WM receiving ibrutinib as monotherapy without concomitant 
use of CYP3A inhibitors, the mean steady-state maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax) was 
94.9 ng/mL and the mean area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to the last 
quantifiable concentration (AUClast) was 620 ng.h/mL.  The coefficient of variation (CV) was 80.2% for 
Cmax and 68.5% for AUClast.  In the same study, in subjects with WM receiving ibrutinib in 
combination with rituximab, the mean Cmax was 116 ng/mL and AUClast was 743 ng.h/mL.  The CV 
was 89.8% for Cmax and 72.9% for AUClast. 
Similarly, in subjects with CLL/SLL receiving 420 mg/day Ibr+Ob in Study 1130 and in combination 
with BR in Study CLL3001, the exposures were consistent with those previously observed for ibrutinib 
monotherapy in other B-cell malignancies. 
This approach is acceptable since the PK profile of ibrutinib has previously been studied in the CLL 
population. The combination with rituximab has been studied in the WM population and no PK 
interaction between the two substances was detected. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Key efficacy and safety data to support the Type II variation to extend the current authorized 
indication in CLL are derived from the Phase 3 randomized, controlled Study E1912 (Ibr+R versus FCR) 
(Table 2).

Title: A Randomized Phase III Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-32765)-based Therapy vs Standard Fludarabine, 
Cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab (FCR) Chemoimmunotherapy in Untreated Younger Patients with 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). 
General design: Study E1912 was a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of ibrutinib plus rituximab (Ibr+R) vs. FCR for previously untreated subjects with 
CLL age 70 years or younger. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Ibr+R (Arm A) or 
FCR (Arm B), respectively. Randomization was stratified according to age (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years), 
ECOG performance status (0/1 vs. 2), disease stage (Rai stage I/II vs. III/IV), and baseline 
cytogenetic abnormalities (deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 [del 11q] vs. other). Subjects in 
the Ibr+R arm received ibrutinib in combination with 6 cycles of rituximab (after a single cycle of 
ibrutinib alone) followed by ibrutinib until disease progression. Subjects in the FCR arm received 6 
cycles of FCR. 
Study Period: 10 March 2014 (first subject enrolled) to 17 July 2018 (data cutoff for primary 
analysis). 
Region: At the time of the data cutoff for primary analysis, there were 201 sites across the United 
States.

Genetic testing 
Subjects were tested for del 11q and consenting subjects were tested for the TP53 and 
IGHV mutational statuses. Prior to registration, del 11q was analyzed by local laboratories and used for 
stratification. Analyses of TP53 and IGHV mutational statuses were performed by a central laboratory 
(Mayo Clinic) after registration. Patients with del 17p (assessed by local laboratories prior to 
registration) were excluded because of the poor outcome of these patients to FCR. 
Treatments 
Patients in the Ibr+R arm received ibrutinib 420 mg orally daily in combination with 6 cycles of 
rituximab after a single cycle of ibrutinib alone followed by ibrutinib until disease progression. Subjects 
in the FCR arm received 6 cycles of FCR.  
Each cycle was 28 days. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression -free survival (PFS) per protocol IWCLL 
criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/452512/2020  
Page 15/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints were: Overall Survival (OS); PFS assessed by investigator in high risk population 
(del11q/mutated TP53/ unmutated IGHV); QoL assessed as change in FACT-Leu Trial Outcome Index 
(TOI) Score at 12 Months; Overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by investigator per protocol 
criteria. 
Exploratory endpoints were QoL assessed as change in FACT-Leu TOI Score at 3 months after 
beginning of therapy; QoL assessed as change in FACT-Leu TOI Score at 6 months after beginning of 
therapy. 
Response criteria were all in accordance with the 2008 iwCLL criteria (Hallek 2008) with incorporation 
of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Hallek 2013; Hallek 2012). Response and 
progression were assessed by the investigator and confirmed by ECOG-ACRIN case evaluation which 
included Operations Office (ECOG-ACRIN data management team) and Study Chair review. Any cases 
requiring adjudication (cases in which the Operations Office/Study Chair disagreed with the 
investigator, or the Operations Office and Study Chair disagreed with one another) were sent to the 
designated ECOG-ACRIN Executive Officer for disease progression determination in alignment with the 
protocol and iwCLL 2008 response criteria.

Subjects were re-evaluated for progression every 4 weeks (+/-10 days) during the first 6 months of 
the study by physical exam and complete blood count (CBC), and thereafter every 3 months until 
progression. After progression, the follow-up schedule was every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 
6 months for years 3-5, and then every 12 months for years 6-10.  
Formal response evaluation occurred at the 12-month response evaluation (or off study evaluation). 
Computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline, and at 12 months for all subjects with evidence of 
response or stable disease were required, but not required for those with disease progression. At the 
time of the 12-month response evaluation, a bone marrow biopsy was required for all subjects with 
evidence of response or stable disease but was not required for those with disease progression.  
Assessment of progressive disease was based on ALC, physical examination of lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly, or by both ALC and physical examination (ie, CT scans were not used to 
determine disease progression) and was confirmed by ECOG-ACRIN case evaluation, which included 
Operations Office (ECOG-ACRIN data management team) and study chair review. 
The rates of progression by physical examination only (as opposed to ALC only or both physical 
examination and ALC) were monitored by the DSMC every 6 months for potential bias in assessment of 
progression by physical exam. If the difference in proportion of progression assessed by physical 
examination only between the arms was larger than the greater of 10 subjects or 20%, the study team 
would assess possible changes to the criteria for progression for those subjects where progression was 
based solely on physical examination. 
Unscheduled CT Scans: Since this is an open label trial, it is possible that an imbalance in unscheduled 
CT scans could emerge between arms and influence assessment of disease progression. To address 
this issue, all unscheduled CT scans performed on both arms as well as the reason for unscheduled CT 
scans will be recorded. This information will be collected to identify differences in the frequency of such 
unscheduled CT scans between arms and allow us to detect potential bias in ascertainment of disease 
progression. 
Sample size 
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS as the primary endpoint and was 
powered for this endpoint. The sample size of 519 subjects was determined based on the following 
assumptions: PFS is exponentially distributed; 2:1 randomization between the 2 arms; Median PFS is 
78 months in treatment arm (Arm A: Ibr+R); Median PFS is 52 months in control arm (Arm B: FCR); 
Target HR of 0.67 (Arm A vs. Arm B); Two-sided alpha of 0.05. 
With the above study assumptions, the study with a total of 203 PFS events would achieve an overall 
power of 80%. Additionally, assuming the time to 25% of FCR subjects dying was 62.5 months in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/452512/2020  
Page 18/66 
 
 
 
 
control arm, a total of 125 OS events among 519 subjects would provide for 80% power to detect a 
target HR of 0.60 (Arm A vs. Arm B) at a 2-sided level of significance of 0.05. This sample size would 
also allow the study to detect a range of 4.9 to 9.4 in the difference in mean Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy – Leukemia Trial Outcome Index (FACTLeu TOI) score between the 2 arms with an 
80% power at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, assuming a 50% to 80% compliance rate. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; no blinding was performed nor deemed feasible given that FCR is 
administered via IV infusion and ibrutinib is administered orally. 
Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Ibr+R (Arm A) or FCR (Arm B), respectively, using 
permuted blocks with stratification and dynamic balancing on main institutions. The stratification 
factors were age (< 60 vs. ≥ 60 years), ECOG performance status (0/1 vs. 2), disease stage (Rai 
stage I/II vs. III/IV), and baseline cytogenetic abnormalities (del 11q vs. other). Randomization was 
implemented using Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) operated by ECOG-ACRIN through its 
Patient Registration System. 
Statistical methods 
Interim analysis 
The interim analysis was performed only after all subjects had the opportunity for at least 2 years (and 
up to 52 months) of follow-up. 
As described in the study protocol and the SAP, prespecified interim analyses for PFS were planned to 
start at 24 to 27 months after full accrual and continue annually until either the efficacy boundary was 
crossed or full information (203 PFS events) was reached. The prespecified boundary proposed by 
CTEP for the first PFS interim analysis was 2.807 on the z-statistics scale, corresponding to a 1-sided 
p-value of 0.0025 (or 2-sided p-value of 0.005). Nevertheless, the upper boundary for the final 
analysis was to be determined using the Lan-DeMets error spending function to preserve the overall 
type-I error rate. 
If the primary endpoint PFS achieved statistical significance at an interim analysis, then final analysis 
for PFS was reached. Interim analyses for OS (first secondary endpoint) were to start when the 
superiority boundary for PFS was crossed and continue annually until early stopping criteria were met 
or full information (125 deaths) was reached. For earlier information time, a prespecified truncated 
version (1-sided p-value of 0.0005 or 2-sided p-value of 0.001) of the Lan-DeMets error spending 
function corresponding to the O’Brien-Fleming boundary was to be used. 
Per the SAP, if both PFS and OS crossed the prespecified superiority boundaries at an interim analysis, 
subsequent test of secondary endpoints (PFS in high-risk population, change in FACT-Leu TOI at 12 
months, and overall response rate [ORR]) were to be performed at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 
in a sequential hierarchical manner based on a closed testing procedure. Secondary endpoints were to 
be ranked in sequence according to the hierarchical order shown in the Study endpoint table below. 
The first interim analysis performed by ECOG-ACRIN, based on a data cutoff of 17 July 2018, crossed 
the prespecified superiority boundary for the primary endpoint of PFS—the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS 
favored Ibr+R over FCR—and the Applicant as well as the sites were notified of the results, which were 
subsequently published. This application is based on an independent analysis by the Applicant with the 
same 17 July 2018 data cutoff (25 months after full accrual). The data were subject to ongoing study 
oversight including additional monitoring, with the analysis based on data extracted and transferred

analysis methods as presented in the SAP, were finalized prior to data transfer.

Outcomes and estimation 
The results presented are based on the interim analysis, which crossed the prespecified superiority 
boundary and therefore is considered the primary analysis for Study E1912 with a data cutoff of 17 
July 2018.  
The median time on study for the ITT population was 36.6 months overall (range: 0.03 to 52.3 
months); 37.7 months (range: 0.03 to 52.3 months) for the Ibr+R arm and 33.7 months (range: 0.1 
to 51.4 months) for the FCR arm.

The difference in rates of progression by physical examination only (as opposed to ALC only or both 
physical examination and ALC) between the 2 arms was reviewed before each DSMC meeting 
throughout study conduct and never exceeded the prespecified threshold. 
Per protocol, CT scans at baseline, and at 12 months for all subjects with evidence of response or 
stable disease, were required.  
Secondary endpoints 
Because the primary endpoint (PFS) achieved statistical significance, testing for OS (first secondary 
endpoint) was performed subsequently per the prespecified boundary (2-sided p-value of 0.001). 
Because both PFS and OS crossed the prespecified superiority boundaries at the interim analysis, 
subsequent tests of secondary endpoints (PFS in high-risk population, change in FACT-Leu TOI score at

Table 17: Comparison of PFS across studies with ibrutinib in treatment-naïve CLL. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
Key efficacy and safety data to support the Type II variation to extend the current authorized 
indication in CLL are derived from Study E1912: “A Randomized Phase III Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-
32765)-based Therapy vs Standard Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab (FCR) 
Chemoimmunotherapy in Untreated Younger Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)”.  
Study E1912 was a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of ibrutinib plus rituximab (Ibr+R) vs. FCR for previously untreated subjects with CLL age 
70 years or younger, excluding subjects with del 17p disease. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio 
to receive Ibr+R (Arm A) or FCR (Arm B), respectively. Randomization was stratified according to age 
(< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years), ECOG performance status (0/1 vs. 2), disease stage (Rai stage I/II vs. 
III/IV), and baseline cytogenetic abnormalities (deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 [del 11q] 
vs. other). Subjects in the Ibr+R arm received ibrutinib in combination with 6 cycles of rituximab (after 
a single cycle of ibrutinib alone) followed by ibrutinib until disease progression. Subjects in the FCR 
arm received 6 cycles of FCR. 
Response criteria were all in accordance with the 2008 iwCLL criteria (Hallek 2008) with incorporation 
of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Hallek 2013; Hallek 2012). Response and 
progression were assessed by the investigator and confirmed, unblinded to treatment, by ECOG-ACRIN 
case evaluation which included Operations Office (ECOG-ACRIN data management team) and Study 
Chair review. Any cases requiring adjudication (cases in which the Operations Office/Study Chair 
disagreed with the investigator, or the Operations Office and Study Chair disagreed with one another) 
were sent to the designated ECOG-ACRIN Executive Officer for disease progression determination in 
alignment with the protocol and iwCLL 2008 response criteria. 
The data were subject to ongoing study oversight including additional monitoring, with the primary 
analysis based on data extracted and transferred from ECOG-ACRIN to the MAH on 02 August 2019. 
Updated analyses, including stratified analyses where appropriate, with a data cutoff of 2 August 2019 
were provided as responses to the CHMP RSI.

This is an open-label study. The proportion of subjects not receiving study treatment differs 
significantly between the two treatment groups (0.6% and 9.7% in the experimental group and the 
control group respectively). This raises questions of the comparability of the groups actually treated. 
Furthermore, the proportion of subjects who discontinued study due to withdrawal of consent differs 
between treatment groups (2.8% and 18.9% in the experimental group and the control group 
respectively). These issues were further addressed by the MAH. Although the exact meaning of these 
imbalances remains unclear and selection bias is deemed likely to be at hand, the tipping point 
analysis performed for PFS suggest that the ITT analysis is robust to the discontinuation pattern. 
Response and progression were assessed by the investigator and confirmed by ECOG-ACRIN case 
evaluation which included Operations Office (ECOG-ACRIN data management team) and Study Chair 
review. Any cases requiring adjudication (cases in which the Operations Office/Study Chair disagreed 
with the investigator, or the Operations Office and Study Chair disagreed with one another) were sent 
to the designated ECOG-ACRIN Executive Officer for disease progression determination in alignment 
with the protocol and iwCLL 2008 response criteria. The MAH has clarified that non-investigator 
assessment/confirmation of OR and PD was not blinded to treatment, meaning that, despite 
undertaken mitigation procedures, a potential bias affecting the efficacy evaluation cannot be ruled out 
in this open study. 
Cross-over from the control arm was not formally part of the protocol. As information on post-
progression therapy is largely lacking and treatment with commercial ibrutinib monotherapy obviously 
was an option at time of PD in the control arm, OS is hard to interpret. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Demographic and general baseline characteristics were reasonably balanced. Fractions with known 
high-risk disease (TP53 mutation, del 11q or unmutated IGHV) were 65% in the experimental arm and 
47% in the control arm. However, the study was genetically only stratified for del 11q but when it 
comes to TP53 mutation and IGHV mutation only consenting subjects were tested and the fractions 
with unknown status (16% and 21% in the experimental arm, respectively; 23% and 35% in the 
control arm, respectively) are deemed too large to allow a conclusion on balance between study arms.  
The evaluation of efficacy data is not considered substantially hampered by the performed protocol 
amendments or changes in planned analyses, or the protocol deviations. 
The time-dependent efficacy outcomes consistently favour the experimental arm, Ibr+R, over the 
control arm, FCR. This holds true also for the updated efficacy evaluation with data cutoff 2 August 
2019, with ITT event rates of 30% for PFS (25% at the primary analysis, 17 July 2018, with a median 
follow-up of 37 months) and 7% for OS in the control arm. However, as information on post-
progression therapy is largely lacking and treatment with commercial ibrutinib monotherapy obviously 
was an option at time of PD in the control arm, OS is hard to interpret. The significant differences 
between study arms in proportions of subjects not receiving study treatment or discontinuing the study 
due to withdrawal of consent is of concern, especially in an open-labelled study, although less so after 
the tipping point analysis for PFS provided in the response to the first LoQ. Further, as treatment 
regimens with different treatment duration are compared, data on PFS2 or a relevant proxy would be 
very informative, but will unfortunately not be available. 
At the time of study initiation analysis of TP53 mutational status was not recommended in the US 
(NCCN) CLL treatment guidelines, and assays were not available across all study sites. FCR is 
nowadays not a valid treatment option for TP53-mutated disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/452512/2020  
Page 39/66 
 
 
 
Regarding the efficacy evaluation in the high-risk population it should be noted that TP53 mutation and 
IGHV mutation status were only tested in consenting subjects, with higher fractions with unknown 
status in the control arm (23% and 35% in the control arm, respectively; 16% and 21% in the 
experimental arm, respectively). Original consent for genetic testing was obtained before subject 
randomization but this does not exclude possible selection bias as withdrawal of consent could also 
result in missing test results. The issue was further addressed and although potential bias cannot be 
fully excluded, the outcome of the primary analysis is considered robust. 
When isolation of contribution of each drug in the Ibr+R combination is considered, the pivotal study 
does not provide information. However, from a regulatory point of view, and as has been previously 
accepted in other procedures, ibrutinib could be viewed as a substitution of F+C in the guideline-
recommended combination with rituximab. The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the efficacy 
of ibrutinib + rituximab vs ibrutinib monotherapy. 
The sought indication is broader, i.e. encompassing all treatment-naïve CLL subjects, than the 
population studied in the pivotal study, i.e. subjects ≤ 70 years of age with previously untreated 
CLL/SLL without del 17p in need of treatment and deemed eligible for FCR. From a strict efficacy point 
of view, it is considered reasonable to assume similar activity of the combination in patients non-fit for 
FCR. Regarding activity in del 17p disease too few patients with TP53 mutation, sharing similar dismal 
prognostic value as for del 17p in the setting of CIT, were enrolled in the pivotal study to allow any 
conclusion. However, in several earlier studies ibrutinib, as monotherapy or in combination therapy, 
was shown to be highly effective also in del 17p disease.   
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The time-dependent efficacy outcomes consistently favour the experimental arm, Ibr+R, over the 
control arm, FCR. The efficacy of Imbruvica in the sought indication has been demonstrated. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In addition to safety tabulations and analyses of the two arms of the pivotal study E1912 the MAH has 
provided an overall reference to the Current Label Pool (=the safety profile presented in the current 
SmPC), representing integrated data for 1,200 subjects receiving ibrutinib as monotherapy or in 
combination therapy across the 9 studies representing the currently approved indications in CLL 
(Studies 1102 [420 mg/day treatment arm only], 1112, 1115, 1130, and CLL3001), WM (Studies 
1118E and 1127 [Arms A and C]), and MCL (Studies 1104 and MCL3001).

papular, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, hypertension, and contusion occurred at a 
higher incidence (≥10% higher) in the Ibr+R arm compared with the FCR arm.  
Of those TEAEs reported in at least 20% of subjects in either treatment arm in Study E1912, platelet 
count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased, lymphocyte 
count decreased, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and infusion-related reaction occurred at a 
higher incidence (≥10% higher) in the FCR arm compared with the Ibr+R arm. 
Among the most commonly (≥20% of subjects in either arm) reported TEAEs for the Ibr+R and FCR 
treatment arms for the first 6 months, a difference between arms of ≥10% and higher in the Ibr+R 
arm was observed for lymphocyte count increased (73.6% Ibr+R versus 39.9% FCR), diarrhea (41.5% 
Ibr+R versus 26.6% FCR), arthralgia (25.9% Ibr+R versus 9.5% FCR), and contusion (21.6% Ibr+R 
versus 3.8% FCR).

Lymphocyte count increased (58.0%), neutrophil count decreased (32.4%), hypertension (18.8%), 
leukocytosis (16.5%), lymphocyte count decreased (9.7%), anemia (6.8%), white blood cell count 
decreased (6.0%), and arthralgia (5.1%) were the most common (≥5% of subjects) Grade 3 or 4 
TEAEs in the Ibr+R arm, and the incidence rates for lymphocyte count increased, leukocytosis, 
arthralgia, and hypertension were at least 2% higher than those in the FCR arm. Common (≥5% of 
subjects) Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the FCR arm that occurred at a ≥2% higher rate compared with the 
Ibr+R arm were lymphocyte count decreased (67.1%), neutrophil count decreased (44.9%), white

neutropenia (15.8%), and rash maculo-papular (5.1%). 
During the first 6 months of study treatment, 82.1% of subjects in the Ibr+R arm and 89.9% 
of subjects in the FCR arm had a TEAE of Grade 3 or higher. The most common (≥5% of subjects) 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs for the first 6 months in the Ibr+R arm were: lymphocyte count 
increased (58.0%), neutrophil count decreased (22.7%), leukocytosis (15.1%), hypertension 
(7.4%), anaemia (6.0%), and lymphocyte count decreased (5.7%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Serious TEAEs were not summarized. The CRF was not designed to distinguish serious vs. non-serious 
events, hence SAEs were not able to be identified from the clinical database. 
Deaths 
During the first 6 months of study treatment, the incidence of fatal TEAEs was 0.3% (n=1) for Ibr+R 
vs. 1.3% (n=2) for FCR. 
During the entire study period, there were 4 deaths on the Ibr+R arm (1.1% of subjects) including 
pleural effusion/lung cancer, CLL (due to underlying disease/PT term: multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome), unknown (PT: death), and respiratory failure occurring in 1 subject each. During the entire 
study period, there were 10 deaths (6.3% of subjects) on the FCR arm including CLL (3 subjects), 
acute myeloid leukemia (2 subjects), unknown (2 subjects), sepsis (1 subject), metastatic colon 
cancer (1 subject), and drug overdose (1 subject, unrelated to study treatment).

During the treatment-emergent study period, non-melanoma skin cancer (5.7% Ibr+R vs. 1.9% FCR), 
melanoma skin cancer (2.0% Ibr+R vs. 0% FCR), and non-skin cancer (3.1% Ibr+R vs. 1.9% FCR) 
malignancies were observed. 
•  Hypertension 
Blood pressure data were not collected on CRFs. Hypertension events were identified by Hypertension 
SMQ (narrow) search. 
During the first 6 months of study treatment, the incidences of any grade hypertension were 
26.1% Ibr+R vs. 22.2% FCR, and Grade 3 or 4 hypertension 7.4% Ibr+R vs. 6.3% FCR. The additional 
approximately 16% any grade hypertension in the Ibr+R arm over the remaining course of the study 
occurred over an additional 30 months, in alignment with the overall prevalence of hypertension with 
longer term follow-up in years 2 and 3 with ibrutinib treatment in prior studies.

Laboratory findings 
•  Haematology 
Table 28: worst  post-baseline toxicity grade – haematology (safety population) 
During the first 6 months of study treatment, Grade 3 or 4 decreases in hemoglobin (0% Ibr+R 
vs. 1.9% FCR), platelets (4.8% Ibr+R vs. 24.7% FCR), and ANC (19.0% Ibr+R vs. 43.7% FCR) were 
observed. 
•  Clinical chemistry 
During the first 6 months of study treatment, Grade 3 or 4 increases in AST (1.1% Ibr+R vs. 0.6% 
FCR) and bilirubin (0.6% Ibr+R vs. 0% FCR) were observed.  
During the first 6 months of study treatment, Grade 3 or 4 increases in creatinine (0% Ibr+R vs. 1.3% 
FCR) and Grade 3 or 4 decreases in CrCl (0.3% Ibr+R vs. 1.3% FCR) were observed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and information on dose reductions were collected 
separately for Ibr, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide. Dose-reduction was not allowed for rituximab. 
Treatment discontinuation of the complete study medication due to AEs was reported for 11% of 
subjects in the experimental arm and 15% in the control arm. 
TEAEs reported as the primary reason for ibrutinib discontinuation as well as study treatment (ibrutinib 
and/or rituximab) occurred in 10.8% of subjects; the most common events (≥ 1.0% of subjects) were 
arthralgia (2.0%), and anemia (1.1%). 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported in 13% of subjects for ibrutinib and 33% for fludarabine 
or cyclophosphamide. 
TEAEs leading to ibrutinib dose reduction occurred in 12.8% of subjects; the most common events (≥ 
1.0% of subjects) were arthralgia (3.1%), fatigue (1.7%), myalgia (1.7%), diarrhea (1.4%), and 
neutrophil count decreased (1.1%). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The study E1912 safety set for the experimental arm includes 352 subjects with a median treatment 
duration of 34 months (range: 0.23-52.17), and 295 subjects with a treatment duration ≥24 months. 
Given the heterogeneity of the Current Label Pool (=the safety profile presented in the current SmPC) 
and the overall major differences in terms of therapeutic setting and study population versus study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/452512/2020  
Page 53/66 
 
 
 
 
E1912, a direct comparison is not considered informative and therefore largely omitted in this AR. 
Importantly, according to protocol, SAEs and duration of AEs were not captured. 
Safety data from Study E1912 were integrated with those for the Current Label Pool, ie, the 
registrational studies supporting the currently approved indications in the ibrutinib SmPC, for 
determination of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) profile for ibrutinib as a single agent or in 
combination therapy. The integrated population of Study E1912 and the Current Label Pool is referred 
to as the Overall Label Pool and represents data from 1,552 ibrutinib-treated subjects.  
It should be noted that a treatment of fixed duration (control arm) is compared to a treatment until PD 
or intolerance (experimental arm). Safety data retrieved from the full study period as well as covering 
the first six months of therapy, where available and relevant, are presented. 
The safety profile of ibrutinib must nowadays be considered reasonably known. Safety data obtained in 
subjects ≥65 years of age in the PCYC-1130-CA study with ibrutinib in combination with 
obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 antibody with a more pronounced toxicity than rituximab, were assessed 
as acceptable. Therefore, the lack of data on SAEs and duration of AEs is a weakness but not deemed 
critical for the assessment of B/R for the Ibr+R combination. 
Relative to the currently approved ADR table for ibrutinib in the SmPC, the only new ADR identified 
was blood creatinine increased (see SmPC section 4.8). No major differences in terms of overall grade 
≥3 events were reported but it is noted that overall grade ≥3 bleeding events were twice as common 
in the experimental arm. The safety profile of the experimental arm roughly adheres to what has 
previously been described for ibrutinib. Some modifications in the incidences of adverse reactions were 
made in the table under section 4.8. of the SmPC. 
Treatment-emergent haemorrhage AEs were more commonly noted in the experimental arm, overall 
53% with grade 3+4 2.6% vs 11% and 1.2% in the control arm, respectively. These AEs were more 
common in the experimental arm also during the first six months. Major haemorrhage TEAEs were 
reported only for the experimental arm: overall 3.4%, grade 3+4 2.6%. Haemorrhage is part of 
ibrutinib’s safety profile.  
Cardiac arrhytmias are part of ibrutinib’s known safety profile and reflected also in this study. 
Ventricular arrhytmias were noted only in the experimental arm.  
Looking at the entire study period, melanoma as well as non-melanoma skin cancer were more 
commonly reported in the experimental arm. Haematological toxicity was more pronounced in the 
control arm. 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and information on dose reductions were collected 
separately for Ibr, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide. Dose-reduction was not allowed for rituximab. 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported in 13% of subjects for ibrutinib and 33% for fludarabine 
or cyclophosphamide. Treatment discontinuation of the complete study medication due to AEs was 
reported for 11% of subjects in the experimental arm and 15% in the control arm.   
In the context of the ongoing II/61 the MAH should include in the RMP a new date when analysis of 
aggregate clinical study data concerning haemorrhage risk in patients receiving antiplatelet and/or 
anticoagulant drugs is expected. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data from Study E1912 do not raise any new concerns. Relative to the currently approved ADR 
table for ibrutinib in the SmPC, based on the addition of data from Study E1912, 1 new ADR (blood 
Assessment report

creatinine increased) was added and modifications in the incidences of adverse drug reactions were 
implemented. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 16.1 is acceptable. In addition, minor 
revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update, as follows: 
The MAH should include in the RMP new date when analysis of aggregate clinical study data concerning 
haemorrhage risk in patients receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant drugs is expected. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Imbruvica is intended in combination with rituximab in previously untreated CLL.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Approved agents from 4 different classes are available for the frontline treatment of patients with CLL; 
these include tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (eg, ibrutinib), alkylating agents (eg, chlorambucil, 
bendamustine, cyclophosphamide), nucleoside analogs (eg, fludarabine), and anti CD20 monoclonal 
antibodies (eg, rituximab, obinutuzumab). Chemoimmunotherapies (CIT; combinations of 
chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents) are a mainstay of treatment for frontline CLL. Fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the most effective CIT treatment, however it is associated 
with a high rate of hematologic toxicities, and therefore its use is limited to younger, fitter patients 
without comorbidities. Phase 3 data from the CLL8 trial established FCR as the standard first-line 
therapy for young, fit patients with CLL.  Subjects received a mean 5.2 (range, 0-6) cycles of FCR; of 
patients receiving study treatment, 26% did not receive the planned 6 cycles of FCR. With a median 
time on study of 5.9 years, median PFS was 56.8 months.  Approximately 25% of patients were unable 
to tolerate FCR based CIT, with 56% of patients experiencing Grade 3 to 4 hematological toxicities, 
25% experiencing Grade 3 to 4 infections, and 47% requiring dose reductions of any of the 3 drugs by 
more than 10%. Notably, CIT, including FCR, is considerably less effective in CLL with high-risk 
features, including del 17 or TP53 mutation. 
Further, the presence of adverse genomic features del 17p and del 11q, along with TP53 mutations 
and unmutated IGHV clones identified by DNA sequencing, typically confer unfavourable outcomes in 
terms of shorter PFS and OS with conventional CIT regimens used in CLL including alkylating drugs or 
purine analogues (Thompson 2016; Fink 2013; Byrd 2006). Providing patients who have these 
high-risk genomic features with effective therapy options remains an ongoing medical need.  
Ibrutinib is currently approved as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab in previously 
untreated CLL.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study E1912 was a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of ibrutinib plus rituximab (Ibr+R) vs. FCR for previously untreated subjects with CLL age 
70 years or younger without del 17p. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Ibr+R (Arm 
A, n=354) or FCR (Arm B, n=175), respectively. Randomization was stratified according to age (< 60 
years vs. ≥ 60 years), ECOG performance status (0/1 vs. 2), disease stage (Rai stage I/II vs. III/IV), 
and baseline cytogenetic abnormalities (deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 [del 11q] vs. 
other). Subjects in the Ibr+R arm received ibrutinib in combination with 6 cycles of rituximab (after 
a single cycle of ibrutinib alone) followed by ibrutinib until disease progression. Subjects in the FCR 
arm received 6 cycles of FCR.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
At a median follow-up of 37 months, and a maturity of 25% in the control arm and 12% in the 
experimental arm, the interim analysis for PFS based on ECOG-ACRIN evaluation, the primary 
outcome, showed a HR of 0.340 (0.222, 0.522), p<0.0001 with an unstratified log-rank test. The 
outcome is supported by the performed sensitivity analyses and no worrisome trend is noted in the 
subgroup analyses. With 13 months longer follow-up, an updated analysis with 30% maturity in the 
control arm and 16% in the experimental arm, showed a HR of 0.374, p<0.0001. 
At data cutoff the OS maturity was, as expected in this population, low: 1% in the experimental arm 
and 6% in the control arm with a HR of 0.170 (0.053, 0.541), p<0.007 with an unstratified log-rank 
test. The updated analysis (as above for PFS) showed a HR of 0.365, p=0.019, at a maturity of 7% in 
the control arm and 3% in the experimental arm. 
PFS for the high-risk population showed a HR of 0.231 (0.132, 0.404), p<0.0001, with an unstratified 
log-rank test, at a maturity level of 31% in the control arm and 10% in the experimental arm. The 
updated analysis (as above) showed a HR of 0.260, p<0.0001, at a maturity of 40% in the control arm 
and 16% in the experimental arm. 
The ORR per investigator was 97% in the experimental arm and 86% in the control arm, rate ratio 
1.130 (1.061, 1.204), p<0.0001, due to a higher fraction of PRs in the experimental arm. Fractions 
reaching CR/CRi were 53% in the experimental arm and 58% in the control arm. This is in line with the 
known efficacy profile of ibrutinib. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties about the favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The median treatment duration was 34 months in the experimental arm and 5 months in the control 
arm. Safety data retrieved from the full study period as well as covering the first six months of therapy 
were provided.  
In terms of overall grade ≥3 events, no major differences between study arms were reported but it is 
noted that overall grade ≥3 bleeding events were twice as common in the experimental arm. 
Discontinuation of ibrutinib due to AEs was reported for 11% of subjects with arthralgia and anaemia 
as the most prevalent reasons. 
Treatment-emergent haemorrhage AEs were more commonly noted in the experimental arm, overall 
53% with grade 3+4 2.6% vs 11% and 1.2% in the control arm, respectively. These AEs were more 
common in the experimental arm also during the first six months. Major haemorrhage TEAEs were 
reported only for the experimental arm: overall 3.4%, grade 3+4 2.6%. Haemorrhage is part of 
ibrutinib’s safety profile.  
Grade 3+4 anaemia and febrile neutropenia were more commonly reported in the control arm. 
Cardiac arrhytmias are part of ibrutinib’s known safety profile and reflected also in this study. 
Ventricular arrhytmias were noted only in the experimental arm. 
Treatment discontinuation of the complete study medication due to AEs was reported for 11% of 
subjects in the experimental arm and 15% in the control arm.

In terms of adverse events, the safety profile of the experimental arm roughly adheres to what has 
previously been described for ibrutinib. Relative to the currently approved ADR table for ibrutinib in the 
SmPC, based on the addition of data from Study E1912, 1 new ADR, blood creatinine increased, was 
identified and added to the ADRs table under section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Looking at the entire study period, melanoma as well as non-melanoma skin cancer were more 
commonly reported in the experimental arm.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The time-dependent efficacy outcomes consistently favour the experimental arm, Ibr+R, over the 
control arm, FCR. This holds true also for the updated efficacy evaluation with data cutoff 2 August 
2019, with ITT event rates of 30% for PFS (25% at the primary analysis, 17 July 2018, with a median 
follow-up of 37 months) and 7% for OS in the control arm. However, as information on post-
progression therapy is largely lacking and treatment with commercial ibrutinib monotherapy obviously

was an option at time of PD in the control arm, OS is hard to interpret. The significant differences 
between study arms in proportions of subjects not receiving study treatment or discontinuing the study 
due to withdrawal of consent is of concern, especially in an open-labelled study, although less so after 
the tipping point analysis for PFS provided in the response to the first LoQ. Further, as treatment 
regimens with different treatment duration are compared, data on PFS2 or a relevant proxy would be 
very informative, but will unfortunately not be available. 
When isolation of contribution of each drug in the Ibr+R combination is considered, the pivotal study 
does not provide information. However, from a regulatory point of view, and as has been previously 
accepted in other procedures, ibrutinib could be viewed as a substitution of F+C in the guideline-
recommended combination with rituximab. The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the efficacy 
of ibrutinib + rituximab vs ibrutinib monotherapy. 
The sought indication is broader, i.e. encompassing all treatment-naïve CLL subjects, than the 
population studied in the pivotal study, i.e. subjects ≤ 70 years of age with previously untreated 
CLL/SLL without del 17p in need of treatment and deemed eligible for FCR. From an efficacy point of 
view, it is considered reasonable to assume similar activity of the combination in patients non-fit for 
FCR. Regarding activity in del 17p disease too few patients with TP53 mutation, sharing similar dismal 
prognostic value as for del 17p in the setting of CIT, were enrolled in the pivotal study to allow any 
conclusion. However, in several earlier studies ibrutinib, as monotherapy or in combination therapy, 
was shown to be highly effective also in del 17p disease. From a safety and tolerability point of view, 
the safety profile of ibrutinib is nowadays considered reasonably known. Safety data obtained in 
subjects ≥65 years of age in the PCYC-1130-CA study with ibrutinib in combination with 
obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 antibody with a more pronounced toxicity than rituximab, were assessed 
as acceptable. Therefore, the lack of data on SAEs and duration of AEs is a weakness but not deemed 
critical for the assessment of B/R for the Ibr+R combination. The only new ADR identified with the 
Ibr+R combination, as compared to the Current Label Pool, was “blood creatinine increased”.

approved one  
Extension of indication in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to add combination with rituximab as 
follows: In combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated CLL.  
This extension of the approved CLL indication is based on results from the Phase 3 Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG ACRIN) Study E1912 (also 
referred to as PCYC-1126e-CA). 
The SmPC is revised to include information related to the new indication. The PL has been revised 
accordingly. Minor editorial changes have been implemented in Annex IIIA. An updated RMP has been 
submitted. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives for 
Hungary in Sweden in the PL. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP)

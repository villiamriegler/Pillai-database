2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zoledronic  acid  is  a  bisphosphonate.  It  stops  the  action  of  the  osteoclasts,  the  cells  in  the  body  that 
are involved in breaking down the bone tissue. This leads to less bone loss. The reduction of bone loss 
helps to make bones less likely to break, which is useful in preventing fractures in cancer patients with 
bone metastases. 
Patients  with  tumours  can  have  high  levels  of  calcium  in  their  blood,  released  from  the  bones.  By 
preventing  the  breakdown  of  bones,  Zoledronic  acid  also  helps  to  reduce  the  amount  of  calcium 
released into the blood. 
Zoledronic  acid  Actavis  4mg/5ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  generic  application  made 
according  to  Article  10(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  For  this  application,  the  reference  medicinal 
product authorised in the Community not less than 6/10 years ago is Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent 
for  solution  for  infusion,  by  Novartis  Europharm  Limited,  registered  since  20.March  2001  in  the  EU 
(centrally authorised, EU/1/01/176/001-003). 
The  Applicant  claims  essential  similarity  for  their  product  Zoledronic  acid  Actavis  4  mg/5  ml 
concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  with  the  reference  product  Zometa  4  mg/5  ml  concentrate  for 
solution for infusion, authorised as a line extension to Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent for solution for 
infusion  on  24  March  2003  (EU/1/01/176/004-006)  and  this  license  belongs  to  the  same  global 
marketing authorization. 
Since  at  the  time  of  administration  to  the  patient,  the  solutions  are  aqueous  in  nature,  contain  the 
same  active  substance  in  equal  amounts,  and  given  that  they  are  intended  for  parenteral 
administration,  there  is  no  requirement  for  bioequivalence  testing  (cf.CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98  Rev. 
1). 
The applicant applied for all the indications of the reference product (Zometa) :  
  Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, 
radiation or surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients 
with advanced malignancies involving bone. 
  Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).  
Zoledronic acid Actavis must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare 
professionals experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with 
advanced malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks ; patients 
should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily. The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal 
related events should consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  
In patients with renal impairment, the dosing instructions and monitoring of serum 
creatinine as detailed in SmPC section 4.2 should be followed.

Zoledronic acid Actavis 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, further diluted in 
100 ml should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. Patients 
must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic acid 
Actavis. 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established.

Specification 
Zoledronic acid monohydrate is not subject of an official pharmacopoeia. In-house specifications were 
established by both manufacturers covering all relevant tests such as appearance, solubility (Ph.Eur), 
identification  (IR,  HPLC),  pH  (Ph.Eur),  Water  (KF),  Phosphites  (HPLC),  heavy  metals,  related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC). 
The specifications are adequate to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are 
acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Stability 
Stability studies were performed in accordance with current ICH/CHMP guidelines and are still ongoing. 
Test methods applied for stability tests are the same as methods for routine testing. 
One of the manufactures submitted results of three production batches for a time period of 48 months 
long term stability data, and studies performed at 40°C±2°C/75%±5%RH for three production batches 
for  a  time  period  of  6  months.  The  obtained  results  for  the  parameters  tested  were  within  specified 
limits. 
The  second  manufacturer  submitted  data  from  the  stability  study  of  batches  stored  for  6  months 
(40±2°C/75±5%  RH)  and  for  36/60  months  (25±2°C/60±5%  RH).  Forced  degradation  studies  were 
also conducted. The obtained results for the parameters tested were within specified limits. 
 Based  on  the  stability  data  presented  by  both  manufacturers,  the  corresponding  retest  periods  have 
been accepted. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  product  Zoledronic  Acid  4  mg/5  ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  has  been  formulated 
according  to  the  scope  it  was  intended  for,  i.e.,  respectively,  its  route  of  administration  (intravenous 
infusion)  and  its  pharmaceutical  form  (concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion),  based  on  the  available 
data in the literature and using the innovator product Zometa® as reference. 
The applied sterilization method, terminal steam autoclave, demonstrated  to be the most suitable for 
the  finished  product  and  it  guaranteed  the  quality  of  the  finished  product  with  respect  to  the  Quality 
Specification at release; this cycle, 25 minutes at 121.5°C, was successfully validated. 
The formulation contains the same excipients used in the reference product. All of them are well known 
and  widely  used  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  Each  excipient  is  described  in  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia  
Adventitious agents 
The Drug Product Zoledronic Acid 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion does not contain any 
materials  of  animal  and/or  human  origin  which  could  represent  a  potential  risk  concerning  TSE/  BSE 
contamination.

Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  of  Zoledronic  acid  4  mg/  5  ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a 
standard process for parenteral formulations. The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: 
dissolution,  filtration,  filling  and  terminal  moist  heat  sterilisation.  The  required  manufacturing 
parameters  and  ranges  were  determined  during  manufacturing  process  development  and  process 
validation. 
Preliminary process validation study on three pilot batches of Zoledronic Acid 4 mg/5 ml (about 87% of 
the amount of the proposed industrial batch size) were performed with the aim of evaluating the active 
substance  behaviour,  the  chemical  and  microbiological  stability  of  the  finished  product  and  checking 
the reproducibility and robustness of the manufacturing process and its critical steps. A formal process 
validation study will be performed on three consecutive full-scale (or commercial) batches following the 
scheme  proposed  in  the  validation  protocol  and  the  results  of  the  study  will  be  available  before  the 
product is placed on the market. 
Product specification  
The  release  and  shelf  life  specification  of  Zoledronic  acid  Actavis  includes  tests  and  limits  for 
appearance  of  solution  (Visual,  Ph.Eur),  pH  value  (Potentiometric,  Ph.Eur),  extractable  volume 
(Ph.Eur),  Identification  (HPLC  and  colorimetric),  Subvisible  particles(  Ph.Eur),  Assay  and  related 
substances (HPLC), Bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur), Sterility (Ph.Eur), water loss (only shelf life) 
Specifications for the finished product at release and during shelf life are adequate for quality control. 
All methods were described sufficiently.  
Results of batch analyses were presented. All the presented results were within the specification limits 
and confirm both the consistency of production and good performance of the analysis methods. It can 
be  concluded  that  the  analytical  tests  are  suitable,  manufacturing  process  and  analysis  are  well 
controlled.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data under long-term, intermediate and accelerated conditions were provided. 
Three  pilot  batches  of  Zoledronic  Acid  4  mg/5  ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  were 
manufactured  and  introduced  in  stability  program  for  the  testing  periods  and  conditions:  6  months 
under accelerated conditions (40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5°C), 36 months on long term conditions (25°C 
±  2°C/60%  RH  ±  5°C)  and  36  months  on  intermediate  conditions  (30°C  ±  2°C/75%  RH  ±  5°C). 
Furthermore stability data for photo stability, stability data of the drug product after dilution, stability 
data of the drug product after freeze-thaw cycles and stability study of drug product which underwent 
a second terminal sterilization cycle (doubled sterilized vials) were submitted 
For  the  parameters  Appearance,  Colour,  Clarity,  pH,  Visible  particles,  Sub-visible  particles,  bacterial 
endotoxin  and  sterility  no  significant  changes  were  noticed  for  the  available  period  of  study,  as 
compared to the initial testing point, and there are no differences regardless of the storage conditions. 
The stability results of the samples stored at accelerated and long-term conditions for Zoledronic acid 
4mg/5ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  are  well  within  all  parameters  of  the  drug  product 
specification.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non- clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Zoledronic acid Actavis from Actavis Group PTC ehf is considered unlikely to result in 
any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all zoledronic acid containing products and 
the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and 
not increased.

Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with 
advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis in 
patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone 
lesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and 
creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-
Gault formula. Zoledronic acid Actavis is not 
recommended for patients presenting with severe renal 
impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which is defined 
for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials 
with zoledronic acid, patients with serum creatinine 
> 265 micromol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
In patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to

Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal 
function should be appropriately evaluated with 
consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of 
treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis outweighs the 
possible risk. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for 
the prevention of skeletal related events should consider 
that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
Zoledronic acid, used as indicated in sections 4.1 and 
4.2, has been associated with reports of renal 
dysfunction. Factors that may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-
existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic 
acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other 
nephrotoxic medicinal products. While the risk is reduced 
with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 
15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still 
occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure 
and dialysis have been reported in patients after the 
initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. 
Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some 
patients with chronic administration of zoledronic acid at 
recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related 
events, although less frequently. 
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels 
assessed prior to each dose of Zoledronic acid Actavis. 
Upon initiation of treatment in patients with bone 
metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, 
lower doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In 
patients who show evidence of renal deterioration during 
treatment, Zoledronic acid Actavis should be withheld.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of the jaws) have been 
reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as 
zoledronic acid. Many of these patients had signs of local 
infection including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the 
reports refer to cancer patients following tooth 
extractions or other dental surgeries. Osteonecrosis of 
the jaws has multiple documented risk factors including 
a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g. 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids) and co-
morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, 
infection, pre-existing oral disease). Although causality 
has not been determined, it is recommended to avoid 
dental surgery as recovery may be prolonged (see

Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid 
in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies with 
zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Zoledronic acid Actavis should not be used during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into 
human milk. Zoledronic acid Actavis is contraindicated in 
breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential 
adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated 
pharmacological effects considered to be related to the 
compound’s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, 
resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early 
termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on 
fertility in humans.

Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zoledronic acid Actavis treatment in TIH patients who 
also have severe renal impairment should be considered 
only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. 
In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine 
> 400 micromol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No 
dose adjustment is necessary in TIH patients with serum 
creatinine < 400 micromol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see 
section 4.4). 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with 
advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis in 
patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone 
lesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and 
creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-
Gault formula. Zoledronic acid Actavis is not 
recommended for patients presenting with severe renal 
impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which is defined 
for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials 
with zoledronic acid, patients with serum creatinine 
> 265 micromol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
In patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to 
moderate renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, 
which is defined for this population as CLcr 
30-60 ml/min, the following Zoledronic acid Actavis dose 
is recommended (see also section 4.4):

* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 
0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The reduced doses 
for patients with renal impairment are expected to 
achieve the same AUC as that seen in patients with 
creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. 
Following initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should 
be measured prior to each dose of Zoledronic acid 
Actavis and treatment should be withheld if renal 
function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal 
deterioration was defined as follows: 
- 
For patients with normal baseline serum 
creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 micromol/l), an 
increase of 0.5 mg/dl or 44 micromol/l;

Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal 
function should be appropriately evaluated with 
consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of 
treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis outweighs the

possible risk. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for 
the prevention of skeletal related events should consider 
that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
Zoledronic acid, used as indicated in sections 4.1 and 
4.2, has been associated with reports of renal 
dysfunction. Factors that may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-
existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic 
acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other 
nephrotoxic medicinal products. While the risk is reduced 
with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 
15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still 
occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure 
and dialysis have been reported in patients after the 
initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. 
Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some 
patients with chronic administration of zoledronic acid at 
recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related 
events, although less frequently. 
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels 
assessed prior to each dose of Zoledronic acid Actavis. 
Upon initiation of treatment in patients with bone 
metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, 
lower doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In 
patients who show evidence of renal deterioration during 
treatment, Zoledronic acid Actavis should be withheld. 
Zoledronic acid Actavis should only be resumed when 
serum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. 
Zoledronic acid Actavis treatment should be resumed at 
the same dose as that given prior to treatment 
interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on 
renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in patients 
with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as 
serum creatinine ≥ 400 micromol/l or ≥ 4.5 mg/dl for 
patients with TIH and ≥ 265 micromol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl 
for patients with cancer and bone metastases, 
respectively) at baseline and only limited 
pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal 
impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min), the use of Zoledronic acid Actavis is not

Caution is indicated when Zoledronic acid Actavis is used 
with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
Attention should also be paid to the possibility of 
hypomagnesaemia developing during treatment. 
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal 
dysfunction may be increased when Zoledronic acid 
Actavis is used in combination with thalidomide.

Hepatic insufficiency 
As only limited clinical data are available in patients with 
severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific 
recommendations can be given for this patient 
population. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
PSUR submission 
The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product, which 
currently is on a 1-yearly cycle until otherwise decided by the CHMP. The next data lock point for the 
reference medicinal product is 31 August 2012. 
User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of zoledronic acid concentrate for solution for infusion (4 
mg/5 ml). The reference product Zometa is indicated for the prevention of skeletal related events 
(pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery to bone, or tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia) in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, and for treatment of tumour-
induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).

No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
There are no bioequivalence studies submitted with this application, and this is not required under the 
provisions of the “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence” (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1), 
as the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same 
active substance as the currently approved product.  
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4. Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Zoledronic  acid  Actavis  in  the  prevention  of  skeletal  related  events 
(pathological  fractures,  spinal  compression,  radiation  or  surgery  to  bone,  or  tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia)  in  patients  with  advanced  malignancies  involving  bone,  and  in  the  treatment  of 
tumour-induced  hypercalcaemia  (TIH)  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the

2.1.  Introduction 
26 April 2018 
26 April 2018 
Each year in Europe, 62,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed1. Although estimates suggest that 
melanoma represents only 4% of all cases of skin cancer, it accounts for 80% of all skin cancer 
deaths2. It is estimated that 20,000 people die of melanoma per year3.  
The outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation. Approximately 85% of patients with 
melanoma present with localised disease, 10% with regional disease and 5% with distant metastatic 
disease. The 5-year survival rates in patients who present with localised disease and primary tumours 
1.0 mm or less in thickness are very good, with more than 90% of patients surviving. The 5-year 
survival rates decrease as the tumour spreads: for tumours of more than 1.0mm in thickness, survival 
rates range from 50% to 90%, with regional node involvement survival rates are around 50%, for 
within stage III (regional metastatic melanoma) 5-year survival rates range between 20-70%, 
depending on primary nodal involvement. The long term survival for distant metastatic melanoma, the 
5-year survival is less than 10%. Metastatic melanoma can spread to bone, lung, central nervous 
system (CNS), liver, and skin. It can lead to pain, neurologic sequelae including chord compression 
and nerve impingement, hemorrhage, and laboratory abnormalities. Generalized effects of metastatic 
disease also include cachexia, thrombotic and embolic events, and infections.4

Prior to 2011, approved therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma were limited and included 
chemotherapy (DTIC) and immunotherapy (interleukin-2 [IL-2]). Since then, new therapeutic classes 
have been added to the treatment armamentarium administered as monotherapy or in combination. 
These include the B-RAF inhibitors vemurafenib (Zelboraf), dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and MEK inhibitors 
trametinib (Mekinist) and cobimetinib (Cotellic), which are inhibitors of the serine threonine kinases 
BRAF and MEK and monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab (Yervoy), an anti-CTLA-4 blocking antibody, and 
nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) which bind to the programme cell death (PD-1) 
receptor. 
Yervoy (ipilimumab) is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-blocking antibody and has 
the following indication: 
“for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults, and adolescents 12 
years of age and older (see section 4.4)”. 
OPDIVO is indicated for a number of indications, amongst others melanoma which is of interest for the 
current variation application: 
“Opdivo as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
Relative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour 
PD-L1 expression (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
The MAH has applied for an extension of indication to the MA of Yervoy with the proposed indication: 
“YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or 
metastatic) melanoma in adults. 
Relative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour 
PD-L1 expression (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).”. 
The recommended dose is 1 mg/kg nivolumab administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 
minutes every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses in combination with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab administered 
intravenously over 90 minutes. This is then followed by a second phase in which 3 mg/kg nivolumab is 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. The first dose of nivolumab 
monotherapy should be administered 3 weeks following the last dose of the combination of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab. 
Treatment with OPDIVO, either as a monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab, should be 
continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient. 
The proposed extension of indication is identical to the indication approved for Opdivo. Further, the 
clinical data in support of the proposed indication are the same as for Opdivo and have been reviewed 
by the CHMP during the variations EMEA/H/C/003985/II/003 (for final study report of phase 2 
CA209069 and interim data from study CA209067) and EMA/H/C/00398/II/0032 (for the final results 
from study CA209067). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 9/128 
 
 
 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are proteins, which are expected to be metabolised in the body and 
biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), ipilimumab is exempt 
from the submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect 
to pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, protein containing 
products as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) are exempt from ERA studies which is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical studies is acceptable.  No changes to the SmPC section 5.3 have been 
proposed. Ipilimumab is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment, thus the lack of an 
ERA is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology program of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab was based on data 
from three studies: two primary studies, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab 
monotherapy or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab versus ipilimumab monotherapy in subjects with 
previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma (CA209067) and a Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blinded study of nivolumab (1 mg/kg) in combination with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) vs ipilimumab 
alone (3 mg/kg) in subjects with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
(CA209069); and a supportive Phase 1b, open-label, multidose, dose- escalation study of nivolumab in 
Assessment report

combination with ipilimumab in subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV malignant melanoma 
with 0-3 prior therapies (CA209004). 
Population PK of the nivolumab+ipilimumab combination was characterised by combining data from 
studies with data from selected ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy trials, which supported 
previous monotherapy submissions of ipilimumab and nivolumab. The ipilimumab and nivolumab 
exposures determined by PPK analyses were used to characterise the E-R relationships of efficacy and 
safety. The immunogenicity of ipilimumab and nivolumab was also assessed in each of the above 
studies as well as integrated for both the monotherapy and combination regimens. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics of ipilimumab and nivolumab as previously described for their 
respective melanoma monotherapy indications is summarised in Table 1.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study CA209004 was a dose-escalating study to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab when administered concurrently or as sequenced regimens 
in subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV malignant melanoma. Interaction of 
pharmacokinetics between ipilimumab and nivolumab was evaluated by peak and trough 
concentrations of each ipilimumab and nivolumab when given in combination using distinct regimens. 
Ipilimumab and nivolumab were administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion at the protocol-specified 
doses and rates. There were no dose adjustments allowed. After MTD was reached, 2 of the 6 subjects 
who originally enrolled in Cohort 3 continued on study after de-escalation to Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg 
nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab). 
The following table describes the dosing and duration of treatment for each cohort (Table 2).

Figure 1:  
Plot of mean (+SD) nivolumab serum concentration-time profiles following 
coadministration of ipilimumab and nivolumab infusions on day 1 
Ipilimumab peak concentrations at 3 mg/kg in combination with 1 mg/kg nivolumab after the first dose 
were in the range of 63.5-68.5 µg/mL. Ipilimumab trough concentrations at 3 mg/kg in combination 
with 1 mg/kg nivolumab after the first dose were in the range of 9.8-11.9 µg/mL. Ipilimumab peak and 
troughs after Dose 1 were dose proportional between 1 and 3 mg/kg. 
Nivolumab peak and trough concentrations after the first dose for 1 mg/kg of nivolumab in 
combination with 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab Q3W were in the range of 18.1-21.5 µg/mL and 3.2-4.8 
µg/mL, respectively. After the fourth dose, peak nivolumab concentrations increased dose proportional. 
Interaction between ipilimumab and nivolumab PK was further evaluated in the popPK analysis 
including sparse PK data from phase 2 study CA209069 and phase 3 study CA209067. The effect of 
nivolumab coadministration on ipilimumab clearance in the popPK analysis ranged from -7.5% to 11%. 
Ipilimumab co-administered with nivolumab appears to modestly increase nivolumab clearance. 
Compared to nivolumab monotherapy, coadministration with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg resulted in a 35% 
(CI, 27% to 43%) higher nivolumab clearance whereas ipilimumab 1 mg/kg did not appear to have a 
significant effect with a 2% (CI, -21.4% to 24%) increase in nivolumab clearance. The geometric mean 
model-predicted dose-normalised nivolumab Cmin, Cavg and Cmax at steady-state were 
approximately 30.6%, 20.9% and 10.9% lower following nivolumab Q3W in combination with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg compared to nivolumab Q3W without ipilimumab.  
PopPK analyses 
The final popPK models for ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy for melanoma were supplemented 
with data from studies CA209004, CA209067 and CA209069 where ipilimumab was given in 
combination with nivolumab. 
For ipilimumab, the covariates assessed included ipilimumab antibody status, baseline LDH, baseline 
BW and nivolumab co-administration on ipilimumab clearance. The magnitude of the effect of 
continuous covariates, baseline body weight and LDH on clearance and baseline body weight on VC, 
was outside the ± 20% boundaries and is consistent with results from the previous analysis describing 
ipilimumab PK for monotherapy, which determined baseline body weight and LDH to be statistically

significant covariates. The typical values of Clearance and VC of 0.0134 L/hr and 4.04 L, respectively, 
as well as the covariate effects of baseline body weight and LDH on clearance and baseline body 
weight on VC of 0.692, 1.11, and 0.719, respectively. 
The effect of positive anti-ipilimumab antibody status on clearance was assessed as a time-varying 
covariate in the full model. A positive anti-ipilimumab antibody status from the current drug tolerant 
assay (drug tolerance = 75 µg/mL), was estimated to have a negligible effect (magnitude of effect was 
6%) on ipilimumab clearance in the analysis compared to a negative anti-ipilimumab antibody status. 
The individual PK parameter estimates were obtained from the full model and are summarized in  
Table 3. 
Table 3:  
Summary statistics of individual measures of ipilimumab parameters in 
ipilimumab combination therapy (Ipi: 3mg/kg Q3W, Nivo: 1mg/kg Q3W) 
For nivolumab, the following covariates were included in the full model: sex, body weight baseline 
GFR, ECOG status, ipilimumab coadministration, nivolumab immunogenicity. They represent the effects 
of ipilimumab coadministration and anti-nivolumab antibodies on nivolumab clearance, and the 
significant covariates from the previous final model.  
Compared to the reference of no anti-nivolumab antibody detected (antibody negative), the effect of 
anti-nivolumab antibodies on nivolumab clearance was 25% (CI, 16% to 34%) higher using the 
current drug tolerant assay (3rd generation). In subjects with an ECOG performance status of >0, 
nivolumab clearance was 22% higher (based on median values). 
Male subjects had a 12% (CI, 9% to 16%) higher VC than females.  
Baseline body weight was identified as a significant covariate for both clearance and VC with the 
effects of BW at the 5th and 95th percentiles extending outside the ± 20% boundaries, supporting the 
dosing based on bodyweight. 
The individual parameter estimates are obtained from the full popPK model and summarized in

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab on cytokine expression in human whole blood cells (MDX-1106-
010-008R 930036361) 
Cytokine release assays of whole blood were performed to examine the potential of ipilimumab and 
nivolumab alone and in combination to activate cytokine secretion from human peripheral blood cells. 
Positive control anti-CD3 mAb (UCHT-1) induced cytokine secretion in all donors, while treatment with 
ipilimumab and nivolumab mAbs alone or in combination did not stimulate cytokine secretion at 
concentrations up to 100 μg/mL. Addition of the ipilimumab and nivolumab combination did not 
promote nonspecific activation of lymphocytes. 
PD-L1 Expression as a Potential Biomarker  
The relevance of baseline PD-L1 expression in tumours as a potential biomarker of nivolumab efficacy 
is discussed in the clinical efficacy section.  
Activated T cells  
Pharmacodynamic changes in activated (HLA-DR+) CD4 and CD8 T-cells were measured by flow 
cytometry in subjects in Cohorts 1-3 and Cohort 8 at baseline and pre-dose at multiple timepoints 
during treatment (Figure 3). Increases in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were observed with 
concurrent dosing, while no increase was observed for nivolumab monotherapy. Following a single 
dose of the treatment regimen, the mean percentage change from baseline of absolute levels of 
activated CD4+T-cells and CD8+ T-cells, respectively, reached 106.8%/162.4% and 33.5%/111.9% in

Cohorts 1-3 combined/Cohort 8. There was no consistent effect of the dose of nivolumab or ipilimumab 
on the observed increases in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in Cohorts 1-3 and Cohort 8. 
Associations between response and change in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were also not evident.

Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were measured from whole blood samples at pre-treatment and 
during treatment. The maximum mean increase in absolute levels was 0.25 (x10*9 cells/liter) during 
the first 12 weeks of the induction period in Cohorts 1-3 combined, and was 0.26 (x10*9 cells/liter) 
during the combination period of Cohort 8.  
Of the 12 serum cytokines included in the analyses (IFN-G, MIG, IP-10, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2ra, IL-6, IL-
10, TNFa, IL-12p40, IL-12p70 and IL-23), 6 had values that were measurable above the lower limits of 
quantitation of the assay in >15 of the serum samples tested: MIG, IP-10, IL-2ra, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-
12p40. MIG, IP-10, IL-2ra and IL-10 were changed over time with treatment in Cohorts 1-3 (Dose 
Escalation Combination Therapy) and Expansion Cohort 8. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The E-R relationship of efficacy for PFS was developed using data from Study CA209067 in 927 
subjects. The relationship between ipilimumab and nivolumab exposure (Cavg1) and time to PFS was 
described by a semi-parametric Cox Proportional-Hazards (CPH) model. The model performance was 
evaluated by comparing the cumulative probability of PFS predicted by the full model with that 
determined by Kaplan-Meier analyses.  
A graphical presentation of all of the estimated effects in the full model, showing the hazard ratios of 
disease progression across the predictor ranges and the associated 95% confidence intervals is 
presented in Figure 4. 
The predictor variables with a significant effect on the PFS were PD-L1 expression status, gender, body 
weight, and baseline LDH (95% CI of effect did not include 1). Nivolumab Cavg1 was also significant 
predictor of PFS. Cavg1 of nivolumab produced from nivolumab 1 mg/kg+ ipilimumab 3 mg/kg had 
improved PFS relative to Cavg1 from nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy. The 95% CI of all the other 
predictor variables (M-stage, BRAF, ECOG status, age and baseline tumour size) evaluated did not 
have a statistical significant effect on PFS.

Figure 3:  
Estimated covariate effects of exposure-PFS by Cox Proportional-Hazards 
Analysis 
The hazard ratio (HR) of PFS was predicted from the full model at various values of Cavg1, in order to 
understand the impact of ipilimumab and nivolumab regimens on the risk of disease progression. The 
median Cavg1 at nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy was used as the reference. The estimated hazard 
ratios indicated a decreased risk of disease progression in the combination regimens (HR: 0.68) 
compared with nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy, while the risk was higher (HR: 1.87) in the 
ipilimumab monotherapy group. 
Exposure-Response Relationship for Safety 
The E-R relationship of safety Adverse Events leading to dose discontinuation or death (AE-DC/D) was 
developed using the data pooled from various regimens of ipilimumab and nivolumab in CA209004, 
CA209037, CA209069, CA209066 and CA209067 in 1543 subjects. The popPK model predicted Cavg1 
was used as the measure of exposure of both ipilimumab and nivolumab and the relationship between 
ipilimumab and nivolumab exposure (Cavg1) and time to AE-DC/D was described by a semi-parametric 
Cox Proportional Hazard model, and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates as 
well as the potential interaction between ipilimumab and nivolumab Cavg1. The covariates for the full 
model included age, BW, gender, baseline LDH, ECOG status, M stage, line of therapy and PD-L1 
expression level. 
The estimated covariate effects of E-R for safety are shown in Figure 5. The exposure effect was 
represented by hazard ratios of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
compared with that of nivolumab 3 mg/kg (median Cavg1). It shows an increased hazard in both 
ipilimumab monotherapy and combination therapy, with the combination therapy having a greater 
increase.

Immunogenicity 
Anti-ipilimumab antibodies 
Of the 391 ipilimumab antibody evaluable subjects in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group, 24 (6.1%) 
subjects were ipilimumab antibody positive at baseline and 33 (8.4%) subjects were ipilimumab 
antibody positive after treatment. None of the subjects were considered persistent positive and only 
one subject was considered neutralizing positive. The incidence of ipilimumab antibody in combination 
was comparable to that reported for ipilimumab monotherapy.  
Anti-nivolumab antibodies 
Of the 394 subjects who were treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab in combination and evaluable for 
the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, 149 (37.8%) subjects tested positive for anti-product 
antibodies by an ECL assay. Twenty-five subjects were nivolumab antibody persistent positive (N=18, 
4.6%) and/or NAb positive (N=18, 4.6%) in the combination group. The nivolumab antibody titers 
appear to decrease after Week 12, corresponding to the beginning of the maintenance phase when 
ipilimumab treatment was discontinued as per the schedule. The overall incidence of anti-nivolumab 
antibodies in the assessed population was higher as compared to nivolumab monotherapy (12.3%). 
Nivolumab clearance increased by 25% in the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 20/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity – efficacy 
Of the 25 subjects that were nivolumab antibody persistent positive and/or Nab positive in the 
combination group, 5 (20%) subjects had a BOR of CR and 11 (44%) had a BOR of PR. Three (12%) 
subjects had a BOR of SD and 6 (24%) had a BOR of PD. The 1 (4%) subject in the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab combination group who was ipilimumab NAb positive had a BOR of PR. The one subject in 
the nivolumab monotherapy group that was NAb positive had a BOR of CR.  
An additional exposure-response (E-R) analysis of efficacy was conducted evaluating the effect of anti-
drug antibodies (ADA, positive-negative) with respect to progression free survival (PFS). The E-R 
analysis of PFS was conducted using a full Cox proportional-hazards (CPH) model with data from 731 
subjects who received either nivolumab monotherapy or 1 mg/kg nivolumab in combination with 3 
mg/kg ipilimumab. The estimated HR of the occurrence of ADA on the risk of PFS was 1.03, and the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of HR included unity.  
Immunogenicity – safety  
The effect of immunogenicity on safety was assessed in studies CA209004, CA209069, and CA209067. 
In studies CA209004 and CA209069, the safety profiles of the 4 persistent positive subjects and 1 NAb 
positive subject were similar to those observed in nivolumab antibody negative subjects. There were 
no hypersensitivity, acute infusion reactions, and new AEs observed in persistent or NAb positive 
subjects compared to antibody negative subjects.  
In Study CA209067 the number of subjects with hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions was similar 
between the nivolumab+ipilimumab combination (n=14) and nivolumab monotherapy groups (n=16), 
while slightly lower in the ipilimumab monotherapy group (n=9). In addition, in the nivolumab and 
ipilimumab monotherapy groups, hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions were observed in antibody 
negative subjects, whereas hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions were not observed in any 
antibody positive subject. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ipilimumab pharmacokinetics was similar when administered in combination with 1 mg/kg nivolumab 
or as monotherapy. Nivolumab coadministration with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg resulted in a modest 35% 
increase in nivolumab clearance, relative to the nivolumab clearance when given as monotherapy. The 
modest effect of ipilimumab on nivolumab clearance is unlikely to be clinically relevant, because no 
dose response of nivolumab in melanoma has been observed (range 0.1 – 10 mg/kg). 
A dose finding study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. Treatment with 3 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab, the doses approved for monotherapy, resulted in dose-limiting toxicities that exceeded the 
MTD. Treatment with 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab or 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab were tolerable, establishing both dose combinations as the maximum tolerated dose. 
Efficacy seemed comparable in both arms. The dose and exposure response evaluations for 
monotherapy nivolumab suggested that increasing doses of nivolumab above 1 mg/kg did not change 
the likelihood of response, while in monotherapy ipilimumab studies, increasing doses of ipilimumab 
(0.3 mg/kg vs 3 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg) increased the likelihood of clinical response. Therefore, the 
selection of 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab for the extension study and the clinical phase 2 
& 3 study has been sufficiently substantiated.  
The incidence of nivolumab antibodies was higher when nivolumab was combined with ipilimumab 
relative to nivolumab monotherapy (37.8% vs. 12.3%). Neutralising antibodies were observed in 4.6% 
of subjects treated with the combination and nivolumab clearance increased by 25% in the presence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 21/128 
 
 
 
nivolumab antibodies. The immunogenicity of ipilimumab when given in combination with nivolumab 
was low (approximately 8.4% antibody positive), and had no impact on ipilimumab PK.  
The risk of disease progression was lower for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared 
to nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab monotherapy. The risk of disease progression was 
evaluated in sensitivity analyses investigating further covariates. The risk of disease progression 
appeared to increase with lower ipilimumab and nivolumab exposure, higher LDH and body weight, PD-
L1 positivity and in male melanoma subjects. Patients with ECOG status>0, high LDH, low albumin, 
and poor appetite/low bodyweight tend to have lower antibody exposure. The risk of disease 
progression decreased with increased tumour shrinkage data at Week 12 and in patients with positive 
PD-L1 expression. The relevance of baseline PD-L1 expression as a potential biomarker of nivolumab 
efficacy is discussed in the clinical efficacy section.  
No association between baseline values or change from baseline of serum cytokines with response was 
observed, nor was an association with dose of ipilimumab and/or nivolumab. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exposure-response relationships for the combination of 
nivolumab with ipilimumab for treatment of advanced melanoma have been adequately investigated. 
The SmPC has been updated in section 5.2 with PK data from the combination treatment. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose selection 
The dose of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg was based on the totality of available data 
including anti-tumour activity and safety data in study CA209004.  
Study CA209004 
This was a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, multi-dose, dose-escalation study of nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab. Study drugs were administered either concurrently (Cohorts 1 through 5 
and Cohort 8) or in a sequenced regimen (Cohorts 6 and 7) (See Table 5). 
For subjects enrolled in the concurrent dose cohorts, or dose-escalation cohorts (Cohorts 1 through 5), 
the study consisted of Screening (up to 4 weeks), Treatment (induction for up to 24 weeks and 
maintenance for up to 96 weeks), Follow-up (minimum of 12 weeks), and Survival Follow up (up to 3 
years). During the treatment period, subjects were scheduled to receive nivolumab and ipilimumab in 
combination for 4 doses, then nivolumab for 4 additional doses, followed by nivolumab and ipilimumab 
in combination for 8 doses. The Cohort 3 dose regimen exceeded the maximum tolerated dose, thus no 
subjects were enrolled in Cohorts 4 and 5. 
For subjects enrolled in the sequenced regimen cohorts (Cohorts 6 and 7), the study consisted of 4 
periods: Screening (up to 4 weeks), Study Treatment (up to 96 weeks), Follow-up (minimum of 12 
weeks), and Survival Follow up (up to 3 years). 
For subjects enrolled in the nivolumab/ipilimumab combination expansion cohort (Cohort 8), the study 
Assessment report

consisted of the screening period (up to 4 weeks), Treatment period (combination treatment for 12 
weeks then nivolumab monotherapy for 96 weeks), Follow-up (minimum of 12 weeks), and Survival 
Follow up (up to 3 years). During the treatment period, subjects were scheduled to receive nivolumab 
and ipilimumab in combination for 4 doses Q3W, followed by nivolumab alone Q2W.

Figure 5 Study design schematic - CA209067 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were as follows: 
- 
ECOG performance status 0 or 1. 
-  Histologically confirmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma, as per AJCC staging 
system. 
- 
Treatment naïve patients (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma). Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant melanoma therapy was permitted if it was completed at 
least 6 weeks prior to randomisation, and all related adverse events had either returned to 
baseline or stabilised. 
-  Measurable disease by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per RECIST 
1.1 criteria. 
-  Known BRAF V600 mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation testing per local institutional 
standards during the Screening Period. 
- 
Tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of disease must be provided for biomarker 
analyses. In order to be randomised, a subject must have been classified as PD-L1 positive, PD-L1 
negative, or PD-L1 indeterminate. If an insufficient amount of tumour tissue from an unresectable 
or metastatic site was available prior to the start of the screening phase subjects must have 
consented to allow the acquisition of additional tumour tissue for performance of biomarker 
analyses. 
Key exclusion criteria were as follows: 
Assessment report

-  Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases were 
eligible if these had been treated and there was no MRI evidence of progression for at least8 weeks 
after treatment was complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration. 
-  Ocular melanoma. 
-  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I 
diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone 
replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the 
absence of an external trigger were permitted to enrol. 
-  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug 
administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalents were permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. 
- 
Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other 
antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or immune checkpoint pathways. 
Treatments 
This study consisted of 3 phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. 
One cycle of treatment was defined as 6 weeks. On-study tumour assessments began 12 weeks (± 1 
week) from randomisation and continued every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 12 months up to week 
49 from randomisation and every 12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter until disease progression. Subjects 
continued to have tumour assessments in the follow up period if they discontinued treatment for 
reasons other than progression (eg, toxicity). Treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1-defined progression was permitted if the subject 
had investigator-assessed clinical benefit and tolerated the study drug. 
Nivolumab at 3 mg/kg (nivolumab group), 1 mg/kg (nivolumab+ipilimumab group), or nivolumab 
placebo (ipilimumab group) was administered IV over 60 minutes followed by ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg 
(nivolumab+ipilimumab group and ipilimumab group) or ipilimumab placebo (nivolumab group) 
administered IV over 90 minutes. Dosing schedule for the different cycles is shown in Table 9 and 
Table 10 below.

adverse event.  
-  Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
radiation therapy except for palliative radiation therapy or standard or investigational agents for 
treatment of cancer).  
Supportive care for disease-related symptoms was allowed for all subjects in the trial.

unresectable or metastatic melanoma. 
Secondary Objective(s) 
- 
To compare objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab monotherapy to ipilimumab 
monotherapy and that of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab to ipilimumab monotherapy in 
subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. 
- 
- 
- 
evaluate differences in OS, PFS, and ORR between nivolumab combined with ipilimumab and 
nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
To evaluate whether PD-L1 expression is a predictive biomarker for OS 
To evaluate Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as assessed by the European Organisation 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-Primary Endpoints: The co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS 
- 
PFS was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of first documented disease 
progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.  
-  OS was defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of death due to 
any cause. OS will be censored on the last date a subject was known to be alive. 
Secondary endpoints  
-  ORR, defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomised subjects for each 
treatment group; 
-  Differences in OS, PFS and ORR between the groups;  
- 
PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for OS; 
-  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed from European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 responses. 
PD-L1 Results 
PD-L1 expression was based on two different assays: Verified DAKO PD-L1 IHC assay and Validated 
DAKO PD-L1 IHC assay. At study initiation, the validated assay was not available. Analytical 
comparison of the verified and validated assays by DAKO using 104 melanoma tissue samples 
demonstrated an overall agreement in PD-L1 status between the assays of 97.1% using both 1% and 
5% cut-off. 
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 28/128 
 
 
 
PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumour cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 
staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumour cells per a DAKO PD-L1 IHC assay (this is referred to 
as quantifiable PD-L1 expression). If the PD-L1 staining could not be quantified, it was further 
classified as: 
- 
Indeterminate: Tumour cell membrane staining hampered for pre-specified reasons attributed 
to the biology of the tumour tissue sample, such as high melanin content or high cytoplasmic 
staining, and not because of improper sample preparation or handling. 
-  Not evaluable: Tumour tissue sample was not optimally collected or prepared. 
-  Missing: Tumour tissue sample not available for evaluation. 
For stratification purposes with the verified assay, quantifiable PD-L1 expression was dichotomized by 
a 5% cut-off. PD-L1 positive status was defined as a tumour specimen with 5% tumour cell membrane 
staining, and subjects were stratified based on a PD-L1 positive status or PD-L1 negative 
/indeterminate status. Using this cut-off, the MAH determined in tumour biopsy specimens from Study 
MDX1106-034, that 45% of melanoma subjects were defined as PD-L1 positive. Conversely, PD-L1 
negative status was defined as a tumour specimen with <5% tumour cell membrane staining. 
Exploratory endpoints included Duration of objective response (DOR), Time to objective response 
(TTR), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, potential association between 
biomarker (eg, PD-L1) expression and efficacy endpoints, potential association between natural genetic 
variation and efficacy endpoints, and change in health status (EuroQoL EQ-5D). 
Sample size 
Approximately 915 subjects were planned to be randomised to 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1ratio. The 
sample size of the study accounted for the co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS, with an alpha 
allocation of 0.01 for PFS and 0.04 for OS. Formal analyses of PFS and OS were planned to be 
conducted at different time points. 
- 
The PFS analysis was targeted to occur after all subjects had 9 months follow-up per sample size 
and power considerations. However, the required minimum follow-up for analysis of PFS was 6 
months.  
For each PFS comparison, the number of events projected to be observed at 9 months follow-up 
provide approximately 83% power to detect an average hazard ratio (HR) of 0.71 with a Type I error 
of 0.005 (two-sided).  
- 
The OS analysis was targeted to occur after all subjects had 28 months follow-up per sample size 
and power considerations. However, the required minimum follow-up for analysis of OS was 22 
months. 
For each OS comparison, the number of events projected to be observed at 28 months of follow up 
provide approximately 99% power to detect an average HR of 0.65 with a Type I error of 0.02 (two-
sided). 
Approximately 9 months was required to enroll the required number of subjects.

Randomisation 
Subjects who met all eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A: nivolumab+ 
placebo, Arm B: nivolumab + ipilimumab, or Arm C: ipilimumab + placebo, stratified byPD-L1 status 
(positive or negative as determined by the verified assay), M Stage at screening (M0/M1a/M1b vs 
M1c), and BRAF V600 mutation status (wildtype [WT] vs mutation positive). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double blinded study where the subjects and the investigator were blinded to the 
study drug administered (nivolumab plus placebo, ipilimumab plus placebo, or nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab). Upon progression of disease and treatment discontinuation, the investigator and subject 
were unblinded to each subject’s treatment assignment through the IVRS.  
Statistical methods 
Analyses were conducted in following populations: 
Formal analyses of PFS and OS were conducted at different time points with PFS being analysed first 
(PFS analysis time point) followed by analysis of OS (OS analysis time point). Except where otherwise 
noted, analyses were conducted at both time points. 
Time to event distributions (i.e. PFS, OS, time to response, and duration of response) were estimated 
using Kaplan Meier techniques. When appropriate, the median along with 95% CI was estimated based 
on Brookmeyer and Crowley methodology (using log-log transformation for constructing the confidence 
intervals). Rates at fixed time points (e.g. OS at 12 months) were derived from the Kaplan Meier 
estimate along with their corresponding log-log transformed 95% confidence intervals. Confidence 
intervals for binomial proportions were derived using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
The difference in ORRs between the 2 treatment groups along with their two-sided 95% CI was 
estimated using the following Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method of weighting, adjusting for the 
stratification factors PD-L1 status, M stage, and BRAF status. 
Primary Endpoint 
a) PFS analyses were conducted on data from subjects classified as PD-L1 positive, PD-L1negative, or 
PD-L1 indeterminate and regardless of BRAF status. These analyses were done using a 2-sided log-
rank test stratified by PD-L1 status, BRAF status, and M Stage at screening (IVRS source) in 
randomised subjects to compare each of the 2 experimental treatments to the control group. Hazard 
ratios (HRs) and corresponding two-sided 99.5% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards 
model, with treatment group as a single covariate, stratified by the above factors. 
b) OS for each of the two experimental arms will be compared to the control group using a two-sided 
log-rank test stratified by PD-L1 status, BRAF status, and M Stage at screening (IVRS source) in all 
randomised subjects using Hochberg’s procedure to address multiplicity. 
Results 
Nivolumab as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab was approved for the treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults was approved on the submission of efficacy 
and safety data from Study CA209067 for the first co-primary endpoint of PFS, based on a 17-Feb-
2015 DBL with a minimum follow-up of 9 months after first dose of study therapy, were provided. In 
addition, reports providing descriptive OS results and PFS and ORR updates based on the 13-Nov-2015

DBL with a minimum follow-up of at least 18 months after first dose of study therapy were submitted 
during the procedure (EMA/H/C/003985/II/003, refer to EPAR Opdivo). Additional efficacy, including 
the co-primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), and safety data were based on the CA209067 Final 
CSR based on a database lock (DBL) of 13-Sep-2016 and provides at least 28 months of follow-up for 
all subjects. Additional OS data based on 36 months of follow-up (DBL 24 May 2017) were provided as 
well and discussed in the CHMP (EMA/H/C/003985/II/032). The current description of results is 
primarily derived from the latter procedure.  
Participant flow 
Of the 945 subjects randomized (316 to NIVO, 314 to NIVO+IPI, and 315 to IPI), 937 (99.2%) were 
treated (NIVO: 313, NIVO+IPI: 313, and IPI: 311). As of the DBL for the CA209067 Final CSR, the 
proportion of subjects continuing in the treatment period in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups was 
20.4% (64/313), 14.1% (44/313), and 5.1% (16/311), respectively (see Table 11). 
Table 11:  
Subject Status Summary - End of Treatment Period, Treated Subjects 
Recruitment 
The enrolment period lasted approximately 10 months (Jun-2013 to Mar-2014). The last subject was 
randomized on 31-Mar-2014 and the last subject first treatment was on 01-Apr-2014. Study 
CA209067 completed its primary and secondary objectives; the clinical cut-off date for CA209067 was 
01-Aug-2016 with a clinical DBL on 13-Sep-2016. Although the co-primary analysis of OS is 
completed, the study is ongoing and additional survival follow-up may continue for up to 5 years from 
this final analysis.  
The study will end when survival follow-up is completed. 945 subjects were randomized at 137 sites in 
21 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States of America.

Conduct of the study 
Relevant protocol deviations (significant protocol deviations that could potentially affect the 
interpretability of study results) were reported in 0.7% of subjects (NIVO 1.6%, NIVO+IPI 0.3%, and 
IPI 0.3%). No relevant protocol deviation at study entry was reported in > 1 subject. 
The most common relevant protocol deviation during the treatment period was receipt of concurrent 
anti-cancer therapy, affecting 1.3% of subjects in the NIVO group, no subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, 
and 0.3% of subjects in the IPI group (see Table 12). 
Table 12:  
Relevant Protocol Deviations Summary (all randomised subjects) – Study 
CA209067 
An additional Amendment to protocol (only applicable in DE sites) was introduced on 15-Jul-2015: At 
the request of the local health authority, the contraception method of “Male Condom with Spermicide” 
was reclassified under the “Less Effective Methods of Contraception” category.

For All Randomized subjects: 
• 
The majority of the subjects were male (64.6%) and white (97.5%). 
•  Mean age was 59.6 years, with 12.5% of subjects aged 75 years or older. 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects who were BRAF mutation positive was 31.7% as recorded in the 
CSRs. 
The proportion of evaluable subjects with PD-L1 positive expression (≥  5%) was 26.5% 
(223/843) based on the validated assay. 
•  At trial entry, the majority of subjects (93.2%) were AJCC Stage IV and 58.0% of subjects had 
tumours characterized as M1c. 
• 
The percentage of subjects who received adjuvant therapy was 21.7%. The most frequently 
received adjuvant therapy was interferon. 
87.9% of treated subjects in the NIVO group received ≥  90% of the planned dose intensity, which was 
similar to ipilimumab in the IPI group (88.4%) and greater than nivolumab and ipilimumab in the 
NIVO+IPI group (69.0% and 70.6%, respectively). 
The median duration of therapy was 6.60 months in the NIVO group, 2.83 months in the NIVO+IPI 
group, and 3.02 months in the IPI group. A greater proportion of subjects were continuing in the study 
at the time of analysis in the NIVO+IPI group (57.8%), as compared to the NIVO group and IPI group 
(53.4% and 34.1%, respectively). 
Numbers analysed 
The All-Randomized population was the primary population used for the primary efficacy analysis and 
the All-Treated population was the primary population used for safety analyses (Table 17 and  
Table 18).

Outcomes and estimation 
Outcomes were submitted with various DBL as part of the extension of the indication for OPDIVO 
(EMA/H/C/003985/II/003) and submission of the post-authorisation measure 
(EMA/H/C/003985/II/032) to fulfil the condition in Annex II to submit the final report for study 
CA209067. 
Final results at the time of the planned OS analysis after 28 months of follow-up (DBL 13-Sep-2016) 
were submitted. During the procedure data, from an updated analysis from 36 months of follow-up 
were also presented (DBL 24 May 2017). The results for the co-primary and secondary endpoints are

Overall Survival (Co-primary Endpoint) 
A statistically significant improvement in OS was observed in NIVO versus IPI monotherapy (HR = 0.63 
[98% CI: 0.48, 0.81]; stratified log-rank test p-value = <0.0001) and NIVO+IPI versus IPI 
monotherapy (HR = 0.55 [98% CI: 0.42, 0.72]; stratified log-rank test p-value = <0.0001); Figure 8. 
OS rates at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months are presented below in Table 20.Median OS for All 
Randomized subjects was not reached in the NIVO group and NIVO+IPI group as compared to 19.98 
months in the IPI group. The number of events observed at the time of the DBL (467 total deaths) was 
lower than projected (644 deaths) for this time-based analysis at 28 months of follow-up for all 
subjects. 
-  Based on descriptive analyses, NIVO+IPI relative to NIVO demonstrated a numeric difference 
in OS favouring the combination of NIVO+IPI (24-month OS rate: NIVO+IPI 0.64, NIVO 0.59; 
Table 20). Separation between the Kaplan-Meier curves, once present, for the NIVO+IPI group 
relative to the NIVO group relative to the IPI group is maintained over time. (Figure 8).

-  At the time of the DBL (13-Sep-2016), 174 (55.1%), 186 (59.2%), and 118 (37.5%) subjects 
were censored in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. Among those censored, a 
higher proportion of subjects in the NIVO and NIVO+IPI groups relative to the IPI group were 
still on treatment (20.3% and 14.0% relative to 5.1%, respectively), and a greater proportion 
in the NIVO and NIVO+IPI groups were in follow-up (32.6% and 43.6% relative to 28.6%, 
respectively). The proportion of subjects censored who were off study was similarly low in all 3 
groups (NIVO 2.2%, NIVO+IPI 1.6%, and IPI 3.8%).

The OS analysis was not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies received. 
Subsequent systemic therapy was received by 100 (31.8%), 140 (44.3%), and 196 (62.2%) subjects 
in the combination, nivolumab monotherapy, and ipilimumab arms, respectively (Table 21). 
Subsequent immunotherapy (including anti-PD1 therapy, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or other 
immunotherapy) was received by 46 (14.6%), 92 (29.1%), and 139 (44.1%) subjects in the 
combination, nivolumab monotherapy, and ipilimumab arms. (Table 21).

Follow-up for Overall Survival 
Median follow-up for OS (time between randomization date and last known date alive or date of death) 
was 29.95 months (range: 0.0 to 36.1 months) in the NIVO group, 30.41 months (range: 0.1 to 37.4 
months) in the NIVO+IPI group, and 18.63 months (range: 0.0 to 36.9 months) in the IPI group. 
Minimum follow-up for OS (the time between last subject randomized [31-Mar-2014] and clinical cut-
off date [01-Aug-2016]) was 28 months for all subjects. 
Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of randomized subjects; 96.8%, 95.5%, and 94.0% of 
subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively, either died or had a last known alive 
date on or after the data cut-off date. 
Multivariate Analysis of Overall Survival 
Exploratory multivariate analyses identified subject and tumour characteristics of ECOG performance 
status, M stage, baseline LDH, BRAF mutation status, PD-L1 status (tumour PD-L1 expression level 
<1%, ≥1%, indeterminate or not evaluable), and gender which might contribute to the survival 
outcome. The modeling showed that ECOG performance status, M Stage, baseline LDH, BRAF status, 
PD-L1 expression, and gender were significantly associated with OS at a 5% significance level 
irrespective of treatment group, and treatment-by-region was the only significant interaction term at a 
20% significance level (p = 0.0858) (Table 23).

Progression-free Survival (Co-primary Endpoint) 
The formal analysis of the PFS co-primary endpoint occurred at an earlier time point (9-month follow-
up, DBL 17-Feb-2015). An additional analysis of PFS was performed following the 13-Nov-2015 DBL 
and was submitted. The results of a descriptive update to the PFS endpoint based on the 13-Sep-2016 
DBL are provided in Table 24 (reference to summary table) and below, and are consistent with the 
previous analysis.  
Figure 9 provides the PFS Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Based on the data from DBL 13-Sep-2016, at 24 months follow-up, the PFS rate was 0.43 in the 
NIVO+IPI group, 0.37 in the NIVO group, and 0.12 in the IPI group. The median PFS was 6.9 months 
in the NIVO group and 11.7 months in the NIVO+IPI group as compared with 2.9 months in the IPI 
group, All Randomized population (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.66) and (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.34, 
0.51), respectively. At both 9 months and at 18 months, median PFS was 6.87, 11.50, and 2.89 
months for the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively.  
Figure 9 provides the PFS Kaplan-Meier curves.  
121 (38.3%) subjects in the NIVO group, 145 (46.2%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, and 62 
(19.7%) subjects in the IPI group were censored in the PFS analysis. 34.5%, 43.0%, and 13.3% of 
randomized subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively, had their PFS time censored 
on the date of last on-study tumour assessment. The most common reasons for censoring among 
these subjects was ‘still on treatment’ in the NIVO group and ‘in follow-up’ in the NIVO+IPI and IPI 
groups (Table 24).

Objective Response Rate - Secondary Endpoint 
The formal analysis of the ORR secondary endpoint occurred at an earlier time point and were reported 
in the CA209067 Interim CSR (DBL 17-Feb-2015) at the time of the initial variation application for 
Opdivo. An updated descriptive analysis of ORR at 18-months follow-up (DBL 13-Nov-2015) was 
submitted. At both the 9-month (DBL 17-Feb-2015) and 18-month (DBL 13-Nov-2015) analyses, ORR 
rates per Investigator were NIVO 43.7%, NIVO+IPI 57.6%, and IPI 19.0%. The 9-month [DBL 17-Feb-
2015] CR rates were: NIVO 8.9%, NIVO+IPI 11.5%, IPI 2.2% and 18-month [DBL 13-Nov-2015] CR 
rates were: NIVO 9.8%, NIVO+IPI 12.1%, and IPI 2.2%. 
The results of a descriptive update to the ORR endpoint (DBL 13-Sep-2016) are provided in Table 25. 
ORR results for this updated analyses were 44.6%, 58.9%, and 19.0% in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI 
groups, respectively and consistent with those previously reported.

Median TTR was 2.8 months in all treatment groups. The median DOR was not reached in the 
NIVO+IPI group and was 31.1 months (95% CI: 31.11, NR) and 18.2 months (95% CI: 8.34, NR) in 
the NIVO group and IPI group, respectively, in all randomized subjects with a response (Table 26 
Figure 12 below).  
At the time of DBL, there was a greater proportion of responders with an ongoing response (as of the 
last available tumour assessment) in the NIVO and NIVO+IPI groups than in the IPI group (94/141 
[66.7%] subjects, 124/185 [67.0%] subjects, and 30/60 [50.0%] subjects, respectively, derived by 
subtracting the number of subjects with an event [progression] from the number of responders).

Efficacy by Baseline Tumour PD-L1 Expression - Secondary Endpoint 
Tumour Tissue Disposition and Frequency of Tumour PD-L1 Expression 
Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 with stratification by tumour PD-L1 expression (Dako PD-L1 IHC 
assay) status at a 5% expression level (along with BRAF status and AJCC M stage) to one of the 3 
treatment groups. The majority (96.8%) of randomized subjects had tumour tissue samples that were 
retrospectively assessed for tumour PD-L1 expression using the validated Dako assay. 
Tumour PD-L1 Expression and Efficacy 
There was a lower risk of death for NIVO +IPI combination therapy vs IPI monotherapy and for NIVO 
monotherapy vs IPI monotherapy at all predefined levels of tumour PD-L1 expression. Descriptive 
comparisons between the two NIVO-containing arms, suggest improved OS in the lower tumour PD-L1 
expression groups (<1% and <5%) with combination therapy. OS was similar between NIVO and 
NIVO+IPI in the ≥ 1% and ≥ 5% PD-L1 subgroups. Similar results were observed in the Kaplan-Meier 
plots of OS by PD-L1 status and treatment at both the 1% and 5% tumour PD-L1 expression levels 
(Figure 13, Figure 14). The combination of NIVO + IPI also demonstrated improved PFS compared to 
IPI monotherapy across all PD-L1 expression groups (data not shown). 
A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for PD-L1 expression based on OS was constructed 
(Figure 16). As indicated by the shape of the curve and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.6 for NIVO 
and 0.5 for NIVO+IPI, ROC analysis does not clearly define an optimal PD-L1 cut-off that maximizes 
sensitivity and specificity.  
For subjects with tumours having ≥ 5% tumour PD-L1 expression, the updated ORRs (CR +PR) for 
NIVO monotherapy and NIVO+IPI combination therapy were 58.8% and 73.5%, respectively. In those 
subjects with tumours that had < 5% tumour PD-L1 expression, the ORRs for NIVO monotherapy and 
NIVO+IPI combination therapy were 42.3% and 56.2%, respectively (Table 27).

Health-related Quality of Life - QLQ-C30 Secondary Endpoint 
Quality of life measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status remained stable in all treatment 
groups, with no mean change in score from baseline reaching the minimal important difference for the 
patient (i.e., mean change ≥ 10 points) at any time point for any of the three treatment arms.

Overall Survival in Subpopulations 
Survival effect for most subgroups was consistent with that of the All Randomized subjects, including 
BRAF[V600] mutation-positive and BRAF wild-type subjects and favoured the NIVO-containing arms 
compared to IPI monotherapy (Figure 18 and figure 19).

Updated data following a database lock in 24-May-2017 (OS data at 3-years follow-up) 
Slightly more mature results with the updated efficacy results at the data cut-off of May 2017, with +9 
months additional follow up (OS data at 3-years available) in all randomized subjects show a 
statistically significant improvement in OS for NIVO monotherapy vs IPI monotherapy (HR = 0.65 
[98% CI: 0.53, 0.80]; stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001) and the combination (NIVO+IPI) vs 
IPI monotherapy (HR = 0.55 [98% CI: 0.45, 0.69]; stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001). 
Based on descriptive analyses, the combination of NIVO+IPI showed a numeric difference in OS vs 
NIVO (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.07) not reaching statistical significance. Median OS for all 
randomized subjects was not reached in the NIVO+IPI group whereas it was 37.59 months (95% CI: 
29.08, NA) for the NIVO group as compared to 19.94 months (95% CI: 16.85, 24.61) in the IPI group. 
3-year OS rates were 58% for the NIVO+IPI, 52% for NIVO, and 34% for IPI groups. 
OS rates at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months are presented below in Table 28. Kaplan-Meier plot of OS

Study CA209069: Phase 2, randomised, double blinded study of nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab vs ipilimumab alone in subjects with previously untreated, unresectable or 
metastatic  
Study CA209069 was a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study of nivolumab+ipilimumab vs 
ipilimumab alone in subjects with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The 
primary objective was to compare the ORR, as determined by investigators, of nivolumab combined 
with ipilimumab to ipilimumab monotherapy in subjects with BRAF WT unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma (See Figure 28 below).

Figure 27: 
Design of study CA209069 
Design 
Enrolment continued until at least 100 BRAF WT subjects were randomized. Subjects were treated in a 
blinded fashion until progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Tumour assessments using RECIST v1.1 criteria were performed at Week 12 and every 6 weeks for the 
first year, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression (or discontinuation of study therapy in 
patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression) or other protocol defined reasons. 
The primary endpoint of CA209069 was confirmed ORR as assessed by the investigator using RECIST 
v1.1 criteria in BRAF WT subjects. Analysis of the ORR was to occur at least 24 weeks after the last 
subject’s first dose of study treatment. The primary analysis population of CA209069 was BRAF WT 
subjects. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints were: PFS as assessed by the investigator in the BRAF WT population 
and ORR and PFS in the BRAF Mutation-Positive population. PFS and ORR were also evaluated in the All 
Randomized population (BRAF WT and BRAF mutation-positive subjects). Overall survival and the 
association between ORR and PFS and PD-L1 status were exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
A blinded Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC) reviewed all available tumour assessment 
scans to determine response using RECIST v1.1 criteria. IRRC-determined response was used in 
sensitivity analyses of ORR and PFS. 
In order to preserve an experimental-wise type I error rate of 5%, a hierarchical testing approach was 
applied to key secondary endpoints following analysis of the primary endpoint of ORR in BRAF WT 
subjects. The hierarchical ordering of key secondary endpoints was as follows:

Conduct of the study 
Study CA209069 was conducted at 21 sites in 2 countries (US, France). All sites treated at least 1 
subject. Of the 142 randomized subjects, 126 (88.7%) were from the US and 16 (11.3%) were from 
France. 
At the time of analysis, the minimum follow-up was approximately 24 weeks (~6 months) (from 06-
Feb-2014 [date last subject was randomized] to 24-Jul-2014 [clinical cut-off date for ORR]). 
Subject disposition for all treated subjects (N = 140) is summarized below: 
-  At the time of analysis, 26.6% of subjects in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and 41.3% of 
subjects in the ipilimumab group were continuing in the treatment period. 
- 
- 
- 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued in the treatment period due to study drug toxicity 
was 45.7% in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and 15.2% in the ipilimumab group. 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued in the treatment period due to disease progression 
was 16.0% in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and 37.0% in the ipilimumab group. 
The disposition of all treated subjects and all treated BRAF WT subjects was similar. 
Baseline characteristics  
Overall, baseline demographic and disease characteristics in CA209069 were representative of an 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma population and were balanced between the 
nivolumab+ipilimumab and ipilimumab groups for both the BRAF WT and All Randomized populations. 
In the All Randomized population (N = 142): 
- 
- 
The majority of subjects (76.8%) were BRAF WT and 23.2% of subjects were BRAF mutation 
positive (BRAF V600 mutation status as determined by an FDA-approved test). 
The majority of subjects were male (66.9%) and white (97.9%), and the median age was 65.0 
years, with 52.1% and 12.0% of subjects aged 65 or ≥ 75 years. 
-  Subjects had advanced disease and a high proportion of subjects had poor prognostic factors, 
which were balanced between the nivolumab+ipilimumab and ipilimumab groups: 
-  Most subjects had ≥  2 sites of disease; the most common were lung (59.2%), lymph node 
(47.9%), and liver (29.6%) metastases. Eighty-eight (62.0%) subjects had ≥  2 sites of 
metastatic disease. 
-  Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 in81.7% of 
subjects and 1 in 16.9% of subjects. 
-  At trial entry, the majority of subjects were AJCC Stage IV, with 16.2%, 27.5%, and 45.8% 
M1a, M1b, or M1c, respectively. 
-  24.6% of subjects had elevated LDH (>ULN). 
-  A slight difference was observed in the proportion of subjects with the following melanoma 
subtypes: cutaneous melanoma: 84.2% vs. 61.7% of subjects, and acral/mucosal melanoma: 
8.5% vs. 21.3% of subjects.

Results of the sensitivity analysis of IRRC-assessed PFS (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.55;P < 0.0001) 
were consistent with the analysis of investigator-assessed PFS. For the BRAF WT population, the 
median PFS as assessed by the IRRC was not reached in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and was 4.4 
months in the ipilimumab group. 
In all additional sensitivity analyses of PFS, nivolumab+ipilimumab treatment resulted in a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS compared with the ipilimumab group, similar to the primary PFS 
analysis. Notably, in a investigator- assessed sensitivity analysis incorporating both clinical and 
radiographic progression events, the hazard ratio was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.60; P < 0.0001) and the 
estimated median PFS was 8.9 months for the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and 3.0 months for the 
ipilimumab group. 
For the BRAF Mutation-Positive population, the median PFS as assessed by the investigator was also 
longer in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group (7.4 months) than the ipilimumab group (2.7 months; HR: 
0.33; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.90).

•  OS 
OS was an exploratory endpoint and the data were immature at the time of the analysis. While the 
median OS was not reached in either treatment group no detrimental effect on OS in subjects treated 
with combination therapy compared with ipilimumab monotherapy was observed at 6 months of follow-
up. The OS rate for BRAF WT subjects at 6 months was 83% in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and 
73% in the ipilimumab group. Notably, 43.2% of BRAF WT subjects in the ipilimumab group crossed 
over to nivolumab. Median follow-up time for survival was 7.6 months (range, 0.0 to 10.3 months) in 
the nivolumab+ipilimumab group and 7.0 months (range, 1.3 to 10.2 months) in the ipilimumab 
group.

PDL-1 results 
In CA209069, the potential association between tumour PD-L1 expression and efficacy (ORR and PFS) 
of nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy and ipilimumab monotherapy was evaluated. Among 
the 118 subjects for whom PD-L1 status was quantifiable, 68/118 (57.6%) had tumours with at least 
1% PD-L1 expression, 35/118 (29.7%) had tumours with at least 5% PD-L1 expression, and24/118 
(20.3%) had tumours with at least 10% PD-L1 expression. Regardless of PD-L1 expression level (1%, 
5%, or 10% tumour cell membrane expression), no meaningful difference in ORR was observed in 
either of the treatment groups (Table 33).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The combination dose and schedule of nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W for 
4 doses followed by continuous nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W as single agent was selected for Phase 2/3 
studies CA209069 and CA209067 based on an integrated assessment of nivolumab data from in vitro 
and preclinical studies, as well as clinical PK, safety, and efficacy results from Phase 1 studies, 
including CA209004. In study CA209004, treatment with 3 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, 
the doses approved for monotherapy, resulted in dose-limiting toxicities that exceeded the MTD. 
Treatment with 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab (Cohort 2) or 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 
mg/kg ipilimumab (Cohort 2a) were tolerable, establishing both dose combinations as the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD).  
Evaluation of Exposure-Response (E-R) data suggested that increasing doses of nivolumab above 1 
mg/kg did not change the likelihood of response. The dose schedule of 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab was therefore selected. Data from Cohorts 1-3 indicated maximum tumour reduction 
occurred by Week 24 before ipilimumab/nivolumab maintenance treatment began suggesting 
combination maintenance treatment may not add substantially to initial anti-tumour activity. 
Maintenance treatment was replaced with continuous nivolumab (3 mg/kg) treatment Q2W matching 
the recommended single agent nivolumab dose/schedule. Continuous nivolumab treatment may ensure 
that potential counter-regulatory mechanisms of tumour evasion (eg, upregulation of PD-L1 by tumour 
or TILs) will still be blocked. Results from Cohort 8 supported the clinical activity and safety observed 
in Cohorts 1-3, despite the modification in dosing schedule.  
Study CA209067, was a randomised, double-blind, Phase 3 study of nivolumab monotherapy or 
nivolumab+ipilimumab vs ipilimumab monotherapy in subjects with previously untreated, unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma. CA209067 included both BRAF V600 mutation-positive and BRAF WT 
subjects. The co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS, which are considered acceptable. The type I 
error of 0.05 was split between OS with 0.04 and PFS with 0.01 and statistical significance can be

claimed for either PFS or OS (or both). From a methodological and statistical perspective, this was 
considered acceptable. 
The study recruited an untreated population, excluding patients with active autoimmune disease, 
ocular/uveal melanoma, or active brain or leptomeningeal metastases and allowing only patients with 
stable cerebral metastases. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 status (positive or negative as 
determined by the verified assay), M Stage at screening (M0/M1a/M1b vs M1c), and BRAF V600 
mutation status (wildtype [WT] vs mutation positive). Baseline characteristics were balanced across 
the three treatment groups. The median age was 61 years (range: 18 to 90 years), 65% of patients 
were men, and 97% were white. ECOG performance status score was 0 (73%) or 1 (27%). The 
majority of the patients had AJCC Stage IV disease (93%); 58% had M1c disease at study entry. 
Twenty-two percent of patients had received prior adjuvant therapy. Thirty-two percent of patients had 
BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; 26.5% of patients had PD-L1 ≥ 5% tumour cell membrane 
expression. Four percent of patients had a history of brain metastasis, and 36% of patients had a 
baseline LDH level greater than ULN at study entry (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). Significant protocol 
deviations appear to be evenly balanced among the groups of the study. The majority of protocol 
deviations were related to report SAEs, protocol assessment and incorrect dose and/or schedule. No 
issues were raised during the assessment concerning the conduct of the studies submitted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MAH submitted efficacy results from the phase 3 study CA209067 primarily based on the final CSR 
(DBL 13-Sep-2016) and an update based on database lock (24 May 2017). As of  the database lock 
(13-Sep-2016), 249 (79.6%) subjects treated in  the nivolumab group,  269 (85.9%) subjects treated 
in the combination group, and 295 (94.9%) subjects treated in the Ipilimumab  group had 
discontinued study treatment. Although the  co-primary  analysis  of OS  is  completed, the  study is 
ongoing  and  additional  survival  follow-up  may continue for up to 5 years from this final analysis. 
In All Randomized subjects nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg IV Q2W has shown a statistically 
significant improvement in OS vs Ipilimumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) x 4 doses 
(HR = 0.63 [98% CI: 0.48, 0.81]; stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001) and the combination 
(Nivo+Ipi) has shown a statistically significant improvement in OS vs IPI monotherapy (HR = 0.55 
[98% CI: 0.42, 0.72]; stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001). Based on descriptive analyses, 
Nivo+Ipi vs Nivo has shown a numeric difference  in OS favouring the combination (HR 0.88, 95% CI: 
[0.69, 1.12]). Median OS for all randomized subjects was not reached in the Nivo+Ipi and Nivo 
monotherapy groups as compared to 19.98 months in the Ipi group. These results are considered 
clinically relevant as compared to Ipilimumab monotherapy, revealing a clinical meaningful survival for 
the combination and supporting the previous data already obtained from other studies with nivolumab 
in monotherapy. Updated efficacy results at the data cut-off of May 2017, with +9 months additional 
follow up (OS data at 3-years available) are consistent with those observed at earlier time points. 
Slightly more mature results in all randomized subjects show a statistically significant improvement in 
OS for nivolumab monotherapy vs Ipilimumab monotherapy (HR = 0.65 [98% CI: 0.53, 0.80]; 
stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001) and the combination (Nivo+Ipi) vs Ipi monotherapy (HR = 
0.55 [98% CI: 0.45, 0.69]; stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001). Based on descriptive 
analyses, the combination of Nivo+Ipi showed a numeric difference in OS vs Nivo (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 
[0.68, 1.07]) not reaching statistical significance which had been previously described. Median OS for 
all randomized subjects was not reached in the Nivo+Ipi groups whereas it was 37.59 months (95%CI: 
29.08, NA) for Nivo monotherapy group as compared to 19.94 months (95%CI: 16.85, 24.61) in the 
IPI group. 3-year OS rates were 58% for Nivo+Ipi, 52% for Nivo and 34% for Ipi.

Different sensitivity analyses carried out (unstratified analysis and analysis using stratification factors as 
determined at baseline) were consistent with the main result.  
The proportion of events (deaths) were 45%, 41% and 62.5% for Nivo monotherapy, Nivo+Ipi and Ipi 
monotherapy respectively. Among those censored, a higher proportion of subjects in the Nivo and 
Nivo+Ipi groups vs the Ipi group were still on treatment (20.3% and 14.0% vs 5.1%, respectively), 
and a greater proportion in the Nivo and Nivo+Ipi groups were in follow-up (32.6% and 43.6% vs 
28.6%, respectively). These figures could be reflecting the worse tolerability of the combination as 
clearly shown by the discontinuation rates due to drug toxicity (41.9%, 12.8% and 16.1% Nivo+Ipi, 
Nivo and Ipi respectively). 
Results were supported by the co-primary endpoint PFS. For the all randomised population, the median 
PFS was 11.7 months in the combination group versus 2.9 months in the IPI mono group and 6.9 
months in the nivo mono group. The combination of ipi+nivo showed an improved PFS compared to ipi 
(HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.51) as well as to nivo monotherapy (HR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.94). Nivo 
monotherapy showed improved PFS compared to ipi monotherapy (HR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.66). 
The investigator-assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 in All Randomized subjects were significantly higher 
in the NIVO+IPI group compared with the IPI group and numerically higher compared to the nivo 
monotherapy. Corresponding ORRs were 58.9% in the combination group, 19.0% with ipi and 44.6% 
with nivo monotherapy. The median duration of response (DOR) was 31.1 months in the NIVO arm, 
not reached in the NIVO+IPI group and 18.2 months in the IPI arm. 
The proportion of patients that received subsequent anti-cancer therapies was 44.3%, 31.8%, and 
62.2% of subjects in the Nivo, Nivo+Ipi, and Ipi treatment groups, respectively. Ipilimumab was the 
most frequent therapy received in the Nivo group (26.3%) whereas dabrafenib (9.2%) and 
pembrolizumab (39.4%) were in Nivo+Ipi and Ipi groups respectively.   
Results of the sensitivity analysis that accounts for subsequent therapies received by patients (patients 
initiating next-line therapies are censored) though affected by informative censoring, maintain a trend 
for both nivolumab and the combination of Nivo+Ipi superiority over Ipi monotherapy, supporting the 
improved OS observed with Nivo+Ipi. For the comparison of Nivo+Ipi vs. Nivo montherapy, the HR 
crosses the 1 boundary. Although no clear conclusions can be reached, it appears that there may be a 
lack of benefit of the combination over the nivolumab monotherapy in some patients. The analysis of 
subgroups reveals important aspects to be considered, being PD-L1 expression and BRAF status the 
most relevant. Regarding the latter, the mechanism of action and data from retrospective analyses 
suggest that the anti-tumour effects of immunotherapies, including both ipilimumab and nivolumab, 
are independent of the BRAFV600 mutation status. However, there seems to be a difference in terms 
of OS between the combination of Nivo+Ipi and Nivo monotherapy, with a greater benefit with the 
combination in those patients BRAF mutated (HR 0.71 95% CI 0.45-1.11 vs HR 0.97 95% CI 0.74-
1.28), though CIs overlap and are not statistically significant. Analysis of subgroups according to the 
most recent database lock have also been submitted and a similar trend for greater benefit is observed 
with the combination vs. nivolumab monotherapy) in those patients BRAF mutated (vs. BRAF wild-
type) (HR 0.69 95% CI 0.44-1.07 vs HR 0.94 95% CI 0.72-1.22). These OS results may have been 
biased as a result of subsequent anticancer therapies (i.e. BRAF MUT patients may receive BRAF(/MEK) 
targeted therapies while BRAF WT patients may not) and it could be accepted also that the 
combination of baseline characteristics, better prognostic factors and maybe access to further drugs, 
might have influenced the results. In terms of ORR, results are also favouring those patients with 
BRAF[V600] mutation-positive; 66.7% vs 36.7% Nivo+Ipi vs Nivo in BRAF mutated respectively. 
Corresponding data in BRAF WT patients were 53.3% (Nivo+ Ipi) vs 46.8% (Nivo). There is not a 
straightforward explanation of this apparently higher activity of the combination in patients with 
mutated BRAF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 75/128 
 
 
 
OS in the combination treatment appeared to be improved compared to nivo monotherapy in patients 
with a designated PD-L1 low tumour expression (<1%) vs those that had a designated higher 
expression of PD-L1 ( ≥1) (HR 0.74 95%CI 0.52-1.06 vs HR 1.03 95%CI 0.72-1.48). Despite the fact 
that the results were not statistical significant in patients with low PD-L1 tumour expression, the 
Kaplan-Meier plots of OS clearly separate which suggests that perhaps the study was underpowered to 
test this hypothesis. ORR was found to be also higher in the combination in patients with low PD-L1 
tumour expression (54.5% vs. 35%). In patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, no differences were 
observed in the Kaplan Meier curves or the HR between the combination treatment and the nivo 
monotherapy where the K-M curve for OS for the combination treatment overlaps with that of nivo 
monotherapy. However, a 10% higher antitumour activity is still exhibited in patients with PD-L1 
tumour expression ≥ 1% in the combination arm compared to patients with PD-L1 tumour expression 
<1%. The landmark analysis of OS from month 6 by response status suggests a survival benefit for 
those patients who achieve a response (CR or PR). Updated OS data (cut-off of May 2017) in patients 
with PD-L1 status below 1% vs. PD-L1 above 1% (HR 0.70 95% CI 0.49-0.99 vs HR 1.02 95% CI 
0.73-1.43; Nivo+Ipi vs Nivo) seem to show that patients with PD-L1 status above 1% would obtain a 
similar benefit than those treated with the monotherapy with nivolumab. This information is reflected 
in section 4.1. Before initiating treatment with the combination, physicians are advised to carefully 
evaluate the individual patient and tumour characteristics, taking into consideration the observed 
benefits and the toxicity of the combination relative to nivolumab monotherapy (see section 4.4 and 
5.1). 
While the available IHC assay (Dako/Agilent assay) can detect levels of PD-L1 tumor cell expression, 
the test is not able to provide a clear demarcation of a bimodal population that could be defined by a 
dichotomous cut-off. In addition, there are doubts related to the utility of using PD-L1 as a marker in 
clinical practice, given the temporal variability of PD-L1 expression in tissues. There are many 
uncertainties also regarding the heterogeneity of expression of PD-L1 within the patient’s tumours as 
the expression can be discordant between primary tumors and metastases and between intrapatient 
metastases, as well as the reproducibility and consistency of the testing methods used between the 
different labs (tissue processing and storage). Therefore, considering the efficacy data and the issues 
related to the PD-L1 test itself, it would not at this time be feasible to restrict the indication as there is 
no clear way to define a population with a PD-L1 cut-off that would maximize the benefit while 
outweighing the risk of toxicity. 
The results of the combination vs ipilimumab were supported by the Study CA209069, a randomized, 
double-blind Phase 2 study of nivolumab+ipilimumab vs ipilimumab alone in subjects with previously 
untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In the all randomized population (N = 142), the 
majority of subjects (76.8%) were BRAF WT and 23.2% of subjects were BRAF mutation positive. 
Results for ORR were 55.8% vs. 8.5% (nivolumab+ipilimumab vs ipilimumab) with 17% vs 0% of CR 
(nivolumab+ipilimumab vs ipilimumab alone respectively). ORR compared with ipilimumab alone in 
BRAF WT subjects was 59.7% vs. 10.8%. The HR for PFS was 0.38 with a mPFS 8.57 months in the 
whole population. 
2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the all randomised patient population, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has shown a 
clinically meaningful superiority over ipilimumab in terms of OS and PFS. This benefit is more modest 
but still relevant when compared to nivolumab monotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 76/128 
 
 
 
Treatment with the combination of ipilimumab+nivolumab in patients that have tumours with low PD-
L1 tumour expression appear to have an increase in OS and PFS compared to those with a higher 
tumour expression of PD-L1. This reflected in the indication in section 4.1. The SmPC has also been 
updated in 5.1 to reflect the results of the study. Analysis of subgroups according to the most recent 
database lock have shown potential differences to relevant subgroups of patients with BRAF mutated 
vs. wildtype and PD-L1 ≥ 1% vs. PD-L1 < 1% in tumours. No restriction or other measures are 
currently needed within the SmPC. However, the CHMP has requested further analyses on the value of 
biomarkers, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, in studies using the combination therapy of ipilimumab+ 
nivolumab as part of the Annex II conditions for Opdivo and it is recommended that any relevant 
information that arises from these studies should be included in parallel in the product information of 
ipilimumab: 
• 
To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell 
membrane level by IHC (e.g., other genomic-based methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, 
that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, 
PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, 
expression of components of antigen-presentation complexes and/or other inhibitory checkpoint 
receptors/ligands within tumour, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab and/or nivolumab + ipilimumab 
combination therapy efficacy. This will be provided for all the approved indications: 
- Melanoma combination (with ipilimumab): studies CA209038, CA209067 and CA209069 
In addition, levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in circulation will be explored in study 
CA209038. 
• 
To further investigate the relation between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in Phase 1 studies 
(CA209009, CA209038 and CA209064). 
Additional OS data (up to 5 years) from Study CA209069 is expected to be provided by the MAH when 
available. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Updated safety data associated with the final analysis of the co-primary endpoint overall survival in 
Study CA209067 (database lock (DBL) of 13-Sep-2016) and reference is made to the corresponding 
EPAR for this variation (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0032). Safety data generated at the time of the primary 
progression-free survival (PFS) analysis (database lock [DBL] 17-Feb-2015) with a minimum follow-up 
of 9 months after first dose of study therapy was reported in an interim clinical study report (CSR) and 
served as the basis of approval for an EU Type II variation (post-authorization measure).  
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018

For the interim study report (DBL 17-Feb-2015) reference is made to the corresponding EPAR for the 
variation EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0003. The EPAR contains pooled safety data for nivolumab 
monotherapy from the nivolumab treatment groups in CA209067 (N = 313), CA209066 (N = 200), and 
CA209037 (N = 268) and pooled safety data for nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy is 
presented from the nivolumab+ipilimumab treatment groups in CA209067 (N = 313) and CA209069 
(N = 94). The safety data derived from the CA209067 study were generated at the time of the primary 
PFS analysis (DBL 17-Feb-2015) with a minimum follow-up of 9 months after first dose of study 
therapy. In addition, safety data from Cohort 8 of the Phase 1b study, CA209004 (N = 41 subjects), 
were provided. Cohort 8 included subjects with unresectable or metastatic Stage III or IV melanoma 
treated with a similar dosing regimen as CA209067 and CA209069 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 
mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W), but up to 48 doses of nivolumab during 
the monotherapy period.  
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The characterization of the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab+ipilimumab 
combination therapy is derived from 313 subjects treated with NIVO and 313 subjects treated with 
NIVO+IPI in the primary Phase 3 study, CA209067, respectively. Updated safety data is based on the 
final analysis of the co-primary endpoint overall survival in Study CA209067 (database lock (DBL) of 
13-Sep-2016) which provides a minimum follow-up of 28 months for all patients. It was submitted in 
support of a post-authorisation measure (ANX 016) which originated from procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003985/II/003, Type II variation to extend the approved OPDIVO indications to include 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab for treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma in adults (EC Decision granted on 11 May 2016). 
Safety presentations of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, select AEs, and laboratory 
abnormalities are based on all treated subjects using a safety window of 30 days after last dose. The 
30-day safety window was intended to provide a clean characterization of the safety experience of 
nivolumab monotherapy and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab without influence of AEs 
associated with subsequent therapies.  
Table 34:  
Tabular Listing of MAH-sponsored Studies of Nivolumab Monotherapy and 
Combination with ipilimumab 
The overall safety evaluation is based on data from 937 patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug (NIVO Group: (n = 313) nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg intravenous (IV) once every 2 
weeks (Q2W), NIVO+IPI Group: (n = 313) nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
IV once every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W and IPI Group: (n = 
311) ipilimumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg IV Q3W for a total of 4 doses from the study CA209067.

Patient exposure 
Of the 945 subjects randomized (316 to NIVO, 314 to NIVO+IPI, and 315 to IPI), 937 (99.2%) were 
treated (NIVO: 313, NIVO+IPI: 313, and IPI: 311). As of the database lock for the CA209067 Final OS 
CSR, the proportion of subjects continuing in the treatment period in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI 
groups were 20.4% (64/313), 14.1% (44/313), and 5.1% (16/311), respectively (see Table 35). 
Table 35:  
Subject Status Summary - End of Treatment Period, Treated Subjects in 
CA209067 
The enrolment period lasted approximately 10 months (Jun-2013 to Mar-2014). The last patient was 
randomized on 31-Mar-2014 and the last patient first treatment was on 01-Apr-2014. The median 
duration of therapy was 6.60 months in the NIVO group, 2.83 months in the NIVO+IPI group, and 3.02 
months in the IPI group.  
87.8% of treated subjects in the NIVO group received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity, which was 
similar to ipilimumab in the IPI group (88.4%) and greater than nivolumab and ipilimumab in the 
NIVO+IPI group (69.0% and 70.6%, respectively); see Table 36.

The number of subjects in CA209067 with at least 1 AE per individual standardized MedDRA query 
(SMQ) occurring up to 30 days after last dose was analyzed by treatment group using both broad 
scope and narrow scope SMQs. Results of these analyses did not lead to the identification of new types 
of clinically important events. 
Late-emergent drug-related AEs were defined as drug-related AEs with an onset date > 100 days after 
the last dose of study therapy. The overall frequency of late-emergent drug-related AEs (any grade) 
was greater in the NIVO+IPI group (17/313, 5.4%) compared to the NIVO and IPI groups (6/313, 
1.9% and 7/311, 2.3%, respectively). Of subjects with late-emergent drug-related AEs, the majority of 
the events in each treatment group were of Grade 1/2 intensity, except in the IPI group where 4/7 
subjects reported Grade 3 events of diarrhoea, acute polyneuropathy, pruritus, and hypertension. 
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 20.8% of subjects in the NIVO group, 58.5% in the 
NIVO+IPI group, and 27.7% of subjects in the IPI group (Table 40). 
In the NIVO group, no drug-related Grade 3/4 AEs in ≥ 5% of subjects were reported. In the NIVO+IPI 
group, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs (≥ 5% of subjects) were increased 
lipase (10.9%), diarrhoea (9.6%), increased ALT (8.6%), colitis (8.3%), and increased AST (6.1%) 
and in the IPI group were colitis (7.7%) and diarrhoea (5.8%).

•  Select Adverse Events 
Endocrinopathies, diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently 
considered to be select AEs. Multiple event terms that may describe each of these were grouped into 
endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and skin select AE categories, respectively. 
The majority of select AEs reported were Grade 1-2, and most were considered drug-related by the 
investigator. The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related select AE categories (in order of 
descending frequency) across all treatment groups were skin, GI, endocrine, and hepatic. Within these 
categories, the most common drug-related select AEs across all 3 treatment groups were rash and 
pruritus, diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, and ALT increased, respectively. Higher frequencies of drug-
related select AEs in these categories were observed in the NIVO+IPI combination group than in the 
NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018

Across select AE categories, the majority of events were manageable, with resolution occurring when 
immune-modulating medications (mostly systemic corticosteroids) were administered. Some endocrine 
select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.  
In Table 43 the frequency of selected immune-related AEs which required high-dose corticosteroids 
across the pooled melanoma safety database of patients treated with Ipilimumab in combination with 
nivolumab have been summarized. 
Table 43:        Immune-related adverse reactions leading requiring high-dose corticosteroids 
by dosing regimen 
Endocrine Events 
The endocrine select AE category included the following subcategories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, 
pituitary disorders, and thyroid disorders.  
The overall frequency of endocrine select AEs (all-causality, by worst CTC grade) were greater in the 
NIVO+IPI group (38.0%) compared to the NIVO group (20.1%) and the IPI group (12.9%). 
Drug-related endocrine select AEs were reported in 17.3% subjects in the NIVO group, 33.2% in the 
NIVO+IPI group, and 11.6% in the IPI group (Table 44). The most commonly reported drug-related 
endocrine select AE in all 3 treatment groups was hypothyroidism. The majority of the drug-related 
endocrine events were Grade 1-2, with Grade 3-4 events reported in 1.6% subjects in the NIVO group, 
6.4% in the NIVO+IPI group, and 2.6% in the IPI group. No subjects in the NIVO group experienced 
drug-related endocrine select events that led to permanent discontinuation. Endocrine drug-related 
select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of 2.6% and 0.3% of subjects in the 
NIVO+IPI and IPI group, respectively. 
The median time to onset of drug-related endocrine AEs was 13.71 weeks in the NIVO group, 8.07 
weeks in the NIVO+IPI group, and 8.57 weeks in the IPI group. 4 (7.4%) subjects in the NIVO group, 
28 (26.9%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, and 10 (27.8%) subjects in the IPI group were treated 
with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 2-3 weeks. 
Overall, 48.1% in the NIVO group, 53.8% in the NIVO+IPI group, and 44.4% of drug-related 
endocrine select AEs in the IPI group resolved. Median time to resolution was not available in the NIVO 
group, was approximately 28 weeks in the NIVO+IPI group, and was 77 weeks in the IPI group.

Gastrointestinal Events 
The overall frequency of GI select AEs (all-causality, any grade) was greater in the NIVO+IPI group 
(56.5%) compared to the NIVO and IPI groups (36.4% and 49.8%, respectively).  
In the NIVO+IPI group, 47.9% had GI select AEs that were considered to be drug related by the 
investigator compared to 22.4% in the NIVO group and 37.6% in the IPI group (Table 45). The most 
frequent drug-related event was diarrhoea and 2.9%, 9.6%, and 5.8% of the events were Grade 3-4 in 
the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. Drug-related gastrointestinal select AEs (any grade) 
led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 2.9%, 16.6%, and 11.6% of subjects in the NIVO, 
NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO+IPI group, the median time to onset of drug-related GI select AEs was 4.86 weeks 
compared to 9.43 and 4.57 weeks in the NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups, respectively. 68 subjects 
(45.3%) in the NIVO+IPI group, 11 subjects (15.7%) in the NIVO group, and 52 subjects (44.4%) in 
the IPI group were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 4.21, 3.43, and 
4.07 weeks, respectively. Infliximab was used for AE (any grade/any causality) management in 1.3%, 
4.8%, and 5.1% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
Overall, 140/149 (94.0%), 61/68 (89.7%), and 109/116 (94.0%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI, NIVO, and 
IPI groups, respectively, with drug-related GI select AEs had resolution of their events, with a median 
time to resolution of 2.86, 1.64, and 2.86 weeks, respectively.

Hepatic Events 
The overall frequency of hepatic select AEs (all-causality, any grade) was greater in the NIVO+IPI 
group (36.7%) compared to the NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups (13.7% and 11.3%, respectively). 
In the NIVO+IPI group, 32.6% of subjects had hepatic select AEs that were considered to be drug 
related by the investigator compared to 7.7% in the NIVO group and 7.4% in the IPI group (Table 46). 
The most frequent drug-related event across all 3 treatment groups was increased ALT and increased 
AST. The majority of events were Grade 1-2. Drug-related hepatic select AEs (any grade) led to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug in 1.9%, 11.2%,and 1.0% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, 
and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO+IPI group, the median time to onset of drug-related hepatic select AEs was 6.00 weeks 
compared to 15.07 weeks in the NIVO group and 9.00 weeks in the IPI group. 45 subjects (44.1%) in 
the NIVO+IPI group, 8 subjects (33.3%) in the NIVO group, and 3 subjects (13.0%) in the IPI group 
were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 3.57, 3.29, and 3.57 weeks, 
respectively. Mycophenolic acid was used for AE (any grade/any causality) management only in the 
NIVO+IPI group (4 subjects [1.3%]). 
Overall, 96/102 (94.1%), 22/24 (91.7%), and 23/23 (100%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI, NIVO, and IPI 
groups, respectively, with drug-related hepatic select AEs had resolution of their events, with a median 
time to resolution of 5.14, 8.43, and 4.14 weeks, respectively.

Pulmonary Events 
The overall frequency of pulmonary select AEs (all-causality, any grade) was greater in the NIVO+IPI 
group (7.7%) compared to the NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups (2.2% and 3.2%, respectively).  
In the NIVO+IPI group, 7.3% of subjects experienced pulmonary select AEs that were considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator compared to 1.6% in the NIVO group and 1.9% in the IPI group 
(Table 47). Most events were Grade 1-2 and were pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease. Drug-related 
pulmonary select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 0.3%, 1.9%, and 
0.3% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO+IPI group, the median time to onset of drug-related pulmonary select AEs was 9.43 
weeks compared to 9.00 weeks in the NIVO group and 10.07 weeks in the IPI group. 16 subjects 
(69.6%) in the NIVO+IPI group, 4 subjects (80.0%) in the NIVO group, and 3 subjects (50.0%) in the 
IPI group were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 4.43, 4.07, and 5.00 
weeks, respectively. 
Overall, 23/23 (100%), 3/5 (60.0%), and 5/6 (83.3%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI, NIVO, and IPI 
groups, respectively, with drug-related pulmonary select AEs had resolution of their events, with a 
median time to resolution of 6.43, 9.14, and 6.29 weeks, respectively.

Renal Events 
The overall frequency of renal select AEs (all-causality, any grade) was greater in the NIVO+IPI group 
(11.2%) compared to the NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups (3.2% and 4.8%, respectively).  
In the NIVO+IPI group, 6.7% of subjects experienced renal select AEs that were considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator compared to 3 subjects (1.0%) in the NIVO group and 8 subjects 
(2.6%) in the IPI group (Table 48). Most events were Grade 1-2. The most frequently reported drug-
related event across all groups was increased blood creatinine. Drug-related renal select AEs (any 
grade) led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 0.3%, 1.3%, and 0.3% of subjects in the 
NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO+IPI group, the median time to onset of drug-related renal select AEs was 11.43 weeks 
compared to 4.14 weeks in the NIVO group and 10.00 weeks in the IPI group. 4 subjects (19.0%) in 
the NIVO+IPI group, 2 subjects (66.7%) in the NIVO group, and 3 subjects (37.5%) in the IPI group 
were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 2.50, 0.29, and 4.00 weeks, 
respectively. 
Overall, 19/21 (90.5%), 1/3 (33.3%), and 7/8 (87.5%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI, NIVO, and IPI 
groups, respectively, with drug-related renal select AEs had resolution of their events, with a median 
time to resolution of 2.14, not achieved, and 2.50 weeks, respectively.

Skin Events 
The overall frequency of skin select AEs (all-causality, any grade) was similar between the NIVO+IPI 
group and IPI group (65.5% and 63.7%, respectively), while slightly lower in the NIVO group (56.9%).  
In the NIVO+IPI group, 61.3% of subjects experienced skin select AEs that were considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator compared to 45.7% in the NIVO group and 55.3% in the IPI group 
(Table 49). Most were Grade 1-2. Across all treatment groups, the most frequently reported drug-
related skin select AEs were rash and pruritus across all treatment groups. Drug-related skin select AEs 
(any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 0.6%, 1.3%, and 0.6% of subjects in 
the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO+IPI group, the median time to onset of drug-related skin select AEs was 2.14 weeks 
compared to 5.43 weeks in the NIVO group and 3.57 weeks in the IPI group. 12 subjects (6.3%) in the 
NIVO+IPI group, 5 subjects (3.5%) in the NIVO group, and 9 subjects (5.2%) in the IPI group were 
treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 1.36, 3.00, and 1.43 weeks, 
respectively. 
Overall, 134/191 (70.2%), 84/142 (59.2%), and 134/172 (77.9%) subjects in the NIVO+IPI, NIVO, 
and IPI groups, respectively, with drug-related skin select AEs had resolution of their events, with a 
median time to resolution of 10.86, 32.43, and 11.00 weeks, respectively.

Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions 
Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were analyzed along with the select AE categories because multiple 
event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling of terms was therefore necessary for full 
characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered 
select AEs. 
The overall frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (all-causality, any grade) was similar 
between the NIVO and NIVO+IPI groups (5.4% and 4.8%, respectively) while slightly lower in the IPI 
group (2.9%). 
In the NIVO group, 4.5% of subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reactions that were 
considered to be drug related by the investigator compared to 4.2% in the NIVO+IPI group and 2.6% 
in the IPI group (Table 50). The most frequently reported drug-related event across all 3 treatment 
groups was infusion related reaction and most events were Grade 1-2. No drug-related 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of respective study 
therapy in the NIVO and NIVO+IPI groups. One subject (0.3%; 1 Grade 3-4) in the IPI group had a 
drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction that led to permanent discontinuation of study therapy. 
In the NIVO group, the median time to onset of drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions was 
2.21 weeks compared to 3.14 weeks in the NIVO+IPI group and 4.29 weeks in the IPI group. 3 
subjects (21.4%), 1 subject (7.7%), and 1 subject (12.5%) received immune modulating medication 
for any grade drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, 
respectively. No subjects in the NIVO+IPI and IPI groups and 2 subjects (14.3%) in the NIVO group 
were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 0.64 weeks in the NIVO group. 
Overall, 13/14 (92.9%), 11/13 (84.6%), and 8/8 (100%) subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI 
groups, respectively, with drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions had resolution of their 
events, with a median time to resolution of 0.14, 0.29, and 0.14 weeks, respectively.

•  Other Events of Special Interest in CA209067 
Other events of special interest (OESI) are events that do not fulfil all criteria to qualify as select AEs. 
These events may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require 
immunosuppression as part of their management. Analyses of OESIs had extended follow-up (100-day 
window). OESI included the following event categories: demyelination, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, myocarditis, myositis, pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, and uveitis.  
All OESIs (regardless of causality or immune-modulating medication treatment reported within 100 
days of last dose of study drug) are presented in Table 51. 
In the NIVO group, OESIs within 100 days of last dose of nivolumab were reported as follows: 5 
subjects with a pancreatitis event (3 with pancreatitis, 2 with autoimmune pancreatitis), 4 subjects 
with a uveitis event (3 with uveitis, 1 iridocyclitis) and 2 subjects with a myositis events (1 
dermatomyositis, 1 polymyositis). In the NIVO+IPI group were reported: 1 subject with Guillain-Barré, 
4 subjects with pancreatitis, 5 subjects with uveitis, 1 subject with encephalitis and 3 subjects with 
myositis, and in the IPI group were reported: 1 subject with myasthenia gravis, 3 subjects with a 
pancreatitis event (2 with pancreatitis, 1 with acute pancreatitis) and 3 subjects with uveitis. 
Among all treatment groups, the following OESI were not reported: demyelination, myocarditis, and 
rhabdomyolysis.

Safety by Baseline Tumour PD-L1 Expression 
Consistent with that reported in the CA209067 Interim CSR, the overall safety profile of NIVO 
monotherapy and NIVO+IPI combination therapy is not impacted by tumour PD-L1 expression level. 
Although interpretation is limited by small numbers of events, no consistent differences in the 
frequencies of select AEs by tumour PD-L1 expression subgroup (using either a 1% or 5% tumour PD-
L1 expression level) were observed in any select AE across the treatment groups in CA209067. 
Integration of Nivolumab Monotherapy and Nivolumab+Ipilimumab Combination Safety 
Data 
Safety data to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC were integrated across completed studies in multiple 
indications using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W) and 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab (nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV Q3W for 4 doses then 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W). 
The integrated dataset for nivolumab monotherapy included safety with longer follow-up from studies 
CA209037, CA209067 and CA209205. Depending on indication, minimum follow-up for patients in the 
integrated nivolumab monotherapy safety database ranged from 2.3 months to 28 months. 
The integrated dataset for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab included safety with longer 
follow-up from study CA209067 with a minimum follow-up of 28 months in all patients. 
The studies included in the analyses of nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab combination 
therapy and the database lock (DBL) for each study are provided in Table 52.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Consistent with the CA209067 Interim CSR (Table 38), the overall frequencies of SAEs and drug-
related SAEs were lowest in the NIVO group and highest in the NIVO+IPI group (Table 55 and Table 
56). 
SAEs were reported in 42.5% of subjects in the NIVO group, 71.2% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, 
and 55.0% of subjects in the IPI group (Table 55). Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 33.2%, 53.4%, 
and 40.5% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO group, the most frequently reported SAE was malignant neoplasm progression (8.0%), in 
the NIVO+IPI group were diarrhoea (10.5%), colitis (9.9%), and pyrexia (8.3%) and in the IPI group, 
the most frequently reported SAEs were malignant neoplasm progression (10.6%), colitis (8.4%) and 
diarrhoea (8.0%). 
Drug-related SAEs were reported in 9.9% of subjects in the NIVO group, 48.6% of subjects in the 
NIVO+IPI group, and 22.5% of subjects in the IPI group (Table 56). Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were 
reported in 8.0%, 36.7%, and 16.7% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively.

Laboratory findings 
Among all treated subjects, any grade shifts from baseline value were reported within 30 days of last 
dose for selected laboratory tests including absolute neutrophils, haemoglobin, leukocytes, 
lymphocytes, platelet count, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, AST, ALT, creatinine, and 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Laboratory measurements were recorded regardless of causality 
and some were correlated with reported laboratory-based AEs. 
Haematology 
Abnormalities in haematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1-2 across all treatment groups. 
In the NIVO group, the only Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormality reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was 
decreased absolute lymphocytes (5.6% Grade 3 only), in the NIVO+IPI group was decreased absolute 
lymphocytes (5.5% Grade 3 only) and in the IPI group were decreased haemoglobin (6.0% Grade 3 
only) and decreased absolute lymphocytes (5.4% Grade 3; 0.3% Grade 4). 
Serum Chemistry 
Liver Function Tests 
In all 3 treatment groups, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were primarily Grade 1-
2. 
Assessment report

Five subjects in the NIVO group and 7 subjects in the NIVO+IPI group had concurrent ALT or AST 
elevation > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 30 days of last dose of 
study therapy in subjects with available specific liver test results. Four subjects in the NIVO group and 
7 subjects in the NIVO+IPI group had concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3 x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 1 day of last dose of study therapy in subjects with available 
specific liver test results. A summary of on-treatment laboratory abnormalities in specific liver tests is 
provided in Table 58. 
Table 58:  
Summary of On-Treatment Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Liver Tests (SI 
Units) - All Treated Subjects - CA209067 
Kidney Function Tests 
In all treatment groups, the majority of subjects with at least 1 on-treatment measurement had 
normal creatinine values during the treatment reporting period. 
In the NIVO group, on-treatment abnormalities in creatinine (increases) were Grade 1 or 2, except in 2 
subjects with Grade 3 abnormalities. In the NIVO+IPI group, there were 7 subjects with Grade 3 and 1 
subject with a Grade 4 on-treatment increased creatinine levels. In the IPI group, there were 4 
subjects with Grade 3 on-treatment increased creatinine and no subject with Grade 4 abnormalities. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
The majority of subjects in all treatment groups had normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels 
at baseline and throughout the treatment period (Table 59). The proportion of subjects with TSH 
increases (> ULN) from baseline was numerically similar compared to the NIVO and NIVO+IPI groups, 
and greater than the proportion of subjects with TSH increases in the IPI group. In the NIVO+IPI 
group, the proportion of subjects with TSH decreases (< lower limit of normal [LLN]) from baseline 
was greater than that reported in the NIVO and IPI groups.

Electrolytes 
In all 3 treatment groups, most subjects had normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting 
period. In all groups, abnormalities in electrolytes during treatment were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in 
severity. In all groups, the only Grade 3-4 abnormalities in electrolytes reported in ≥ 2% of subjects 
were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia: NIVO group: hyponatremia (2.6% Grade 3, 0.7% Grade 4); 
NIVO+IPI group: hypokalaemia (3.4% Grade 3, 1.0% Grade 4), hyponatremia (9.9% Grade 3, 0.7% 
Grade 4); IPI group: hyponatremia (6.7% Grade 3, 0.3% Grade 4) 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry were monitored and recorded at the site per 
institutional standard of care during screening and treatment visits. These assessments were intended 
to be used as safety monitoring by the treating physician. 
Safety in special populations 
The frequencies of all-causality AEs for subgroups of gender, race, age, and region were similar in all 
treatment groups and consistent with that reported in the CA209067 Interim CSR. 
Safety by age in CA209067 Study 
In CA209067, the frequency of total AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs by MedDRA High-
level Group Term (HLGT)/SMQs/SOC by age group are presented for nivolumab monotherapy in Table

Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
Nivolumab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue is a very common side 
effect which may also impair the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to 
drive or use machines if they feel tired. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of nivolumab and ipilimumab in study CA209067 was updated with this final OS 
analysis. The incidence of nivolumab anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was 12.3% (36/292 subjects) and 
44% (128/291 subjects) following NIVO monotherapy and NIVO+IPI in combination, respectively, in 
the updated analysis for CA209067. The presence of ADA did not appear to have an effect on the 
safety of nivolumab when administered alone or in combination with ipilimumab (refer to Table 62).  
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 109/128 
 
 
 
 
There was low to minimal impact on ipilimumab immunogenicity when ipilimumab was administered in 
combination with nivolumab. Of the ADA evaluable subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, 24/290 (8.3%) 
were ipilimumab ADA positive after treatment. This incidence of ADA to ipilimumab was similar, 5.7%, 
in the IPI monotherapy group. Ipilimumab ADA results are consistent with those in the Interim CSR. 
In the NIVO+IPI combination group, the nivolumab ADA titers appear to decrease after Week 12 
(C3W1), corresponding to the beginning of the maintenance phase when ipilimumab treatment was 
discontinued as per the schedule.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality and drug-related) 
were lowest in the NIVO group and highest in the NIVO+IPI group. 
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 18.2% of subjects in the NIVO group, 47.0% of 
subjects in the NIVO+IPI group and 25.1% of subjects in the IPI group (Table 64). Grade 3-4 AEs

leading to discontinuation were reported in 12.1%, 35.5%, and 21.9% of the subjects in the NIVO, 
NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO group, the most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation were malignant 
neoplasm progression (3.2%), and diarrhoea (2.2%), in the NIVO+IPI group were colitis (9.6%), 
diarrhoea (8.0%), ALT increased (4.8%), and AST increased (4.5%) and in the IPI group were colitis 
(7.1%), diarrhoea (4.8%), and malignant neoplasm progression (3.9%). 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 11.5% of subjects in the NIVO group, 
39.6% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, and 16.1% of subjects in the IPI group (Table 65). Grade 3-
4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.7%, 31.0%, and 14.1% of the 
subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
In the NIVO group, the most frequently reported drug-related AE leading to discontinuation reported 
were diarrhoea (2.2%) and fatigue and ALT increased (each 1.0%), in the NIVO+IPI group were colitis 
(9.6%), diarrhoea (8.0%), ALT increased (4.8%), and AST increased (4.5%) and in the IPI group were 
colitis (7.1%) and diarrhoea (4.8%).

Post marketing experience 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab combination therapy was first approved on 30-Sep-2015 in the US and on 
11-May-2016 in the EU for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma under 
BLA 125554/S-02 and Type II variation EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0003, respectively, and has since been 
approved in multiple countries. 
On 21-Jun-2016, within a type II variation (refer to EMEA/H/C/003985/II/00176) Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC was updated with information aimed at guidance for atypical responses to treatment i.e., an 
initial transient increase in tumour size or small new lesions within the first few months followed by 
tumour shrinkage, associated with nivolumab monotherapy and combination therapy with ipilimumab. 
On 27-Jul-2016, the MAH submitted a type II variation (refer to EMEA/H/C/003985/II/00187) to revise 
Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8 of the OPDIVO (nivolumab) SmPC in order to update the safety information 
for toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis 
based on findings from routine pharmacovigilance activities related to both nivolumab monotherapy 
and combination therapy with ipilimumab. 
On 18-Apr-2017, a type IB variation was submitted (refer to EMEA/H/C/003985/IB/00359) to revise 
Section 4.8 of the OPDIVO and Yervoy SmPC to implement agreed wording for the signal of 
“pemphigoid,” on 06-Mar-2017 following Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) 
adoption 09-Feb-2017 (endorsed by CHMP on 23-Feb-2017). 
Further to the PRAC assessment of nivolumab PSUSA/10379/20160710, the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) on 26-Jan-2017 issued a scientific conclusion following which Sections 
4.4 and 4.8 of the OPDIVO (nivolumab) SmPC were updated to include encephalitis as an undesirable 
effect for the combination therapy.  
Further to the PRAC assessment of nivolumab PSUSA/10379/20170111, the CHMP on 20-Jul-2017 
issued a scientific conclusion following Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the OPDIVO (nivolumab) SmPC were 
updated to add Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome as an undesirable effect for the combination therapy.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Based on updated analyses of safety data from CA209067, with a database lock of 13-Sep- 2016, 
findings were consistent with the mechanisms of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab and with 
expectations based on prior data reported in the CA209067 Interim CSR (DBL 17-Feb-2015) in terms 
of type, frequency and severity of reported events. During the interval between the CA209067 Interim 
CSR and this final analysis of safety, no new safety concerns were reported which could alter the 
characterization of the safety profile of NIVO or NIVO+IPI. As expected with the longer duration of 
treatment and follow-up, the safety profile is slightly worse at the updated database lock relative to 
the CA209067 Interim CSR database lock (17-Feb-2015). 
The median duration of therapy was 2.83 months in the NIVO+IPI group. 87.8% of treated subjects in 
the NIVO group received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity, which was similar to ipilimumab in the 
IPI group (88.4%) and greater than nivolumab and ipilimumab in the NIVO+IPI group (69.0% and 
70.6%, respectively). 
In the NIVO+IPI group the most frequently reported AEs (≥ 20% of subjects) were diarrhoea (54.0%), 
fatigue (51.8%), nausea (43.8%), pyrexia (39.9%), pruritus (39.0%), rash (32.9%), vomiting 
(31.3%), decreased appetite (29.4%), headache (25.6%), cough (24.3%), dyspnea (23.0%), 
arthralgia (21.4%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20.8%).  
In the NIVO+IPI group the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs (≥ 5% of subjects) were lipase 
increased (12.5%), diarrhoea (11.2%), increased ALT (9.3%), colitis (8.3%), increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (6.7%), and fatigue (6.4%). 
In the NIVO+IPI group the most frequently reported drug-related AEs (≥ 15% of subjects) were 
diarrhoea (45.4%), fatigue (37.7%), pruritus (35.8%), rash (29.1%), nausea (28.1%), pyrexia and 
decreased appetite (each 19.2%), ALT increased (18.8%), hypothyroidism and AST increased (each 
16.3%), and vomiting (16.0%). 
The overall frequency of AEs (regardless of causality) leading to a dose delay was 35.8% in the NIVO 
group, 58.1% in the NIVO+IPI group, and 40.8% in the IPI group.  
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 20.8% of subjects in the NIVO group, 58.5% in the 
NIVO+IPI group, and 27.7% of subjects in the IPI group. In the NIVO+IPI group, the most frequently 
reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs (≥ 5% of subjects) were increased lipase (10.9%), diarrhoea 
(9.6%), increased ALT (8.6%), colitis (8.3%), and increased AST (6.1%). 
Select AEs: The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related select AE categories (in order of 
descending frequency) across all treatment groups were skin, GI, endocrine, and hepatic. Within these 
categories, the most common drug-related select AEs across all 3 treatment groups were rash and 
pruritus, diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, and ALT increased, respectively. Higher frequencies of drug-
related select AEs in these categories were observed in the NIVO+IPI combination group than in the 
NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups. Most select AEs were Grade 1-2. The majority of select AEs 
resolved and were manageable using the recommended treatment guidelines for early evaluation and 
intervention.

The overall frequency of endocrine select AEs were greater in the NIVO+IPI group (38.0%) and drug-
related endocrine select AEs were reported 33.2%. The most commonly reported drug-related 
endocrine select AE in all 3 treatment groups was hypothyroidism. Endocrine drug-related select AEs 
(any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of 2.6% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI. 
The overall frequency of GI select AEs was greater in the NIVO+IPI group (56.5%), and 47.9% had GI 
select AEs that were considered to be drug related by the investigator. The most frequent drug-related 
event was diarrhoea, 9.6% of the events were Grade 3-4 in the NIVO+IPI group. Drug-related 
gastrointestinal select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 16.6% of 
subjects in the NIVO+IPI group. 
The overall frequency of hepatic select AEs was greater in the NIVO+IPI group (36.7%) and 32.6% of 
subjects were considered to be drug related by the investigator. The most frequent drug-related event 
across all 3 treatment groups was increased ALT and increased AST. Drug-related hepatic select AEs 
led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 11.2% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group. 
The overall frequency of pulmonary select AEs was greater in the NIVO+IPI group (7.7%) compared to 
the NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups (2.2% and 3.2%, respectively). In the NIVO+IPI group, 7.3% 
of subjects experienced pulmonary select AEs that were considered to be drug-related. Drug-related 
pulmonary select AEs led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 0.3%, 1.9%, and 0.3% of 
subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
The overall frequency of renal select AEs was greater in the NIVO+IPI group (11.2%) compared to the 
NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups (3.2% and 4.8%, respectively). In the NIVO+IPI group, 6.7% of 
subjects experienced renal select AEs that were considered to be drug-related by the investigator 
compared to 3 subjects (1.0%) in the NIVO group and 8 subjects (2.6%) in the IPI group. The most 
frequently reported drug-related event across all groups was increased blood creatinine. Drug-related 
renal select AEs (any grade) led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 0.3%, 1.3%, and 0.3% 
of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
The overall frequency of skin select AEs was similar between the NIVO+IPI group and IPI group 
(65.5% and 63.7%, respectively), while slightly lower in the NIVO group (56.9%). In the NIVO+IPI 
group, 61.3% of subjects experienced skin select AEs that were considered to be drug-related by the 
investigator compared to 45.7% in the NIVO group and 55.3% in the IPI group. Across all treatment 
groups, the most frequently reported drug-related skin select AEs were rash and pruritus across all 
treatment groups. Drug-related skin select AEs led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in 
0.6%, 1.3%, and 0.6% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. 
The overall frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions was similar between the NIVO and 
NIVO+IPI groups (5.4% and 4.8%, respectively) while slightly lower in the IPI group (2.9%). In the 
NIVO group, 4.5% of subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reactions that were considered to 
be drug related by the investigator compared to 4.2% in the NIVO+IPI group and 2.6% in the IPI 
group. No drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions led to permanent discontinuation.  
In the NIVO+IPI group, OESIs within 100 days of last dose of nivolumab were reported as follows: 1 
subject with Guillain-Barré, 4 subjects with pancreatitis, 5 subjects with uveitis, 1 subject with 
encephalitis and 3 subjects with myositis. In the NIVO group were reported: 5 subjects with a 
pancreatitis event (3 with pancreatitis, 2 with autoimmune pancreatitis), 4 subjects with a uveitis 
event (3 with uveitis, 1 iridocyclitis) and 2 subjects with a myositis events (1 dermatomyositis, 1 
polymyositis). And in the IPI group, were reported as follows: 1 subject with myasthenia gravis, 3 
subjects with a pancreatitis event (2 with pancreatitis, 1 with acute pancreatitis) and 3 subjects with 
uveitis. Among all treatment groups, the following OESI were not reported: demyelination, 
myocarditis, and rhabdomyolisis. Cases of fatal toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) were not reported.

SAEs were reported in 42.5% of subjects in the NIVO group, 71.2% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, 
and 55.0% of subjects in the IPI group. Consistent with the CA209067 Interim CSR, the overall 
frequencies of SAEs and drug-related SAEs were lowest in the NIVO group and highest in the NIVO+IPI 
group. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 33.2%, 53.4%, and 40.5% of subjects in the NIVO, 
NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. In the NIVO+IPI group, the most frequently reported SAEs 
were diarrhoea (10.5%), colitis (9.9%), and pyrexia (8.3%). 
Drug-related SAEs were reported in 9.9% of subjects in the NIVO group, 48.6% of subjects in the 
NIVO+IPI group, and 22.5% of subjects in the IPI group. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were reported 
in 8.0%, 36.7%, and 16.7% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. In the 
NIVO+IPI group, the most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were colitis (9.6%), diarrhoea 
(8.9%), and pyrexia (4.2%). 
Deaths: As of the 13-Sep-2016 database lock, a total of 141 (45%), 127 (40.6%), and 195 (62.7%) 
deaths were reported in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. Disease progression was 
the most common cause of death for all groups, including deaths occurring within 30 days of last dose 
and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. 
No additional drug-related deaths were reported within 100 days of the last dose of study drug since 
the database lock for the CA209067 Interim CSR. 
Two new drug-related deaths were reported >100 days after last dose of study drug, in the NIVO+IPI 
group, one due to global cardiac insufficiency of autoimmune myocarditis, and one due to liver 
toxicity/liver necrosis. 
Consistent with the CA209067 Interim CSR, the overall frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation 
(regardless of causality and drug-related) were lowest in the NIVO group and highest in the NIVO+IPI 
group. AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 18.2% of subjects in the NIVO group, 47.0% of 
subjects in the NIVO+IPI group and 25.1% of subjects in the IPI group. Grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 12.1%, 35.5%, and 21.9% of the subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, 
and IPI groups, respectively. In the NIVO+IPI group, the most frequently reported AEs leading to 
discontinuation were colitis (9.6%), diarrhoea (8.0%), ALT increased (4.8%), and AST increased 
(4.5%). 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 11.5% of subjects in the NIVO group, 
39.6% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, and 16.1% of subjects in the IPI group. Grade 3-4 drug-
related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.7%, 31.0%, and 14.1% of the subjects in the 
NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. In the NIVO+IPI group, the most frequently reported 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were colitis (9.6%), diarrhoea (8.0%), ALT increased 
(4.8%), and AST increased (4.5%). 
In CA209067, the incidence rates of AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and drug-related 
SAEs, reported within 100 days of last dose were consistent with those reported within 30 days of the 
last dose. 
Consistent with that reported in the CA209067 Interim CSR, the overall safety profile of NIVO 
monotherapy and NIVO+IPI combination therapy is not impacted by tumour PD-L1 expression level. 
Although interpretation is limited by small numbers of events, no consistent differences in the 
frequencies of select AEs by tumour PD-L1 expression subgroup (using either a 1% or 5% tumour PD-
L1 expression level) were observed in any select AE across the treatment groups in CA209067.

Clinical laboratory evaluations: Abnormalities in haematology laboratory results, liver tests, kidney 
function tests, and electrolytes in subjects receiving NIVO monotherapy and NIVO+IPI therapy were 
primarily Grade 1 or 2. In the NIVO+IPI group, the only Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormality reported 
in ≥ 5% of subjects was decreased absolute lymphocytes (5.5% Grade 3 only). 7 subjects in the 
NIVO+IPI group had concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with total 
bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 30 days of last dose of study therapy in subjects with available specific liver 
test results. There were 7 subjects with Grade 3 and 1 subject with a Grade 4 on-treatment increased 
creatinine levels, hypokalaemia (3.4% Grade 3, 1.0% Grade 4) and hyponatremia (9.9% Grade 3, 
0.7% Grade 4). In the NIVO+IPI group, the proportion of subjects with TSH decreases (< lower limit 
of normal [LLN]) from baseline was greater than that reported in the NIVO and IPI groups.  
The incidence of nivolumab anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was 12.3% (36/292 subjects) and 44% 
(128/291 subjects) following NIVO monotherapy and NIVO+IPI in combination, respectively, in the 
updated analysis for CA209067. The presence of ADA did not appear to have an effect on the safety of 
nivolumab when administered alone or in combination with ipilimumab. Nivolumab ADA results from 
the final OS analysis are consistent with those in the Interim CSR. Of the ADA evaluable subjects in the 
NIVO+IPI group, 24/290 (8.3%) were ipilimumab ADA positive after treatment. 
During the interval between CA209067 Interim CSR and the updated safety analysis, no safety events 
were reported which would alter the characterization of the safety profile of NIVO or the combination of 
NIVO+IPI. The overall frequency and type of AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) (all causality and related) were consistent with that previously reported for each 
treatment group. In general, the frequency of AEs was lowest across AE categories in the NIVO group 
and highest in the NIVO+IPI group.  
No new safety signals were identified; generally the frequency and degree of severity of safety events 
in  the  pooled  combination  therapy  group  was  higher  than  that  observed  in  the  pooled  monotherapy 
group.  The  combination  therapy  of  nivolumab  +ipilimumab  showed  an  increased  toxicity  compared 
with  the  monotherapies  as  shown  by  a  higher  incidence  of  known  AE’s,  G  3-4  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs 
leading to study discontinuation. The number of discontinuations is considered high and suggests that 
the  combination  therapy  is  poorly  tolerated.  Before  initiating  treatment  with  the  combination, 
physicians are advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient and tumour characteristics. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety signals were identified; generally the frequency and degree of severity of safety events 
in the pooled combination therapy group was higher than that observed in the pooled monotherapy 
group. The combination therapy of ipilimumab+ nivolumab showed an increased toxicity compared 
with the monotherapies as shown by a higher incidence of known AE’s, G 3-4 AEs, SAEs, and AEs 
leading to study discontinuation. The number of discontinuations is considered high and suggests that 
the combination therapy is poorly tolerated. The main uncertainties related to the unfavourable effects 
of the combination therapy have been described previously in the initial marketing authorisation of 
ipilimumab and in the variation II-03. They have been included in the RMP. The combination of 
ipilimumab with nivolumab has shown additional PFS and OS benefit relative to nivolumab 
monotherapy only in patients with low tumour PD-L1 expression. Before initiating treatment with the 
combination, physicians are advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient and tumour 
characteristics, taking into consideration the observed efficacy and safety profile of the combination 
relative to nivolumab monotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 20.0 with this application.  
During the assessment of this extension of indication, it was considered that the safety profile of 
nivolumab+ipilimumab was consistent with that already characterized for each agent when 
administered as monotherapy. There were no new risks identified for the combination therapy and 
therefore neither new additional pharmacovigilance activities nor additional risk minimisation measures 
were proposed.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 20.0 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 20.1 (incorporating RMP version 18.6 which 
was finalised with a different procedure in the meantime) with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being 
updated and the Package Leaflet is being revised accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the 
changes to the product information have been evaluated in a previous procedures and do not impact 
the readability of the PL.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Each year in Europe, 62,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed. It is estimated that 20,000 people 
die of melanoma per year. The outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation. The 5-
year survival rates in patients who present with localised disease and primary tumours 1.0mm or less 
in thickness are very good, with more than 90% of patients surviving. The 5-year survival rates 
decrease as the tumour spreads: for tumours of more than 1.0mm in thickness, survival rates range 
from 50% to 90%, with regional node involvement survival rates are around 50%, for within stage III 
(regional metastatic melanoma) 5-year survival rates range between 20-70%, depending on primary 
nodal involvement. The 5-year survival is less than 10% for distant metastatic melanoma.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prior to 2011, approved therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma were limited and included 
chemotherapy (DTIC) and immunotherapy (interleukin-2 [IL-2]). Since then, new therapeutic classes 
have been added to the treatment armamentarium administered as monotherapy or in combination. 
These include the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib (Zelboraf), dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and MEK inhibitors 
trametinib (Mekinist) and cobimetinib (Cotellic), which are inhibitors of the serine threonine kinases 
BRAF and MEK and monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab (Yervoy), an anti-CTLA-4 blocking antibody, and 
nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) which bind to the programme cell death (PD-1) 
receptor. There is still a need for more effective therapies as not all patients respond to treatment and 
part of the patients relapse. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study in support of the extension of indication of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 
for the treatment of adults with advanced (unresectable or metastatic melanoma), was study 
CA209067. This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind 3-arm study evaluating nivolumab 
monotherapy versus nivolumab combined with ipilimumab versus ipilimumab monotherapy in subjects 
with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The primary objective was to 
compare PFS and OS of nivolumab monotherapy vs ipilumimab monotherapy and of nivolumab 
combined with ipilumimab to ipilumimab monotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on the 28 month follow-up for OS (DBL 13 Sep 2016) the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS vs Ipi monotherapy (HR = 0.55 
[98% CI: 0.42, 0.72]; stratified log-rank test p-value = < 0.0001). Median OS was not yet reached 
with the combination, whereas median OS was 19.98 months in the Ipi monotherapy group. 
The result on OS is consistent with the improvement of PFS, median PFS was 11.73 months for the 
combination compared to 2.86 months for the ipilimumab monotherapy (HR 0.42; 95%CI 0.34, 0.51). 
A higher antitumor activity was also observed in the combination treatment compared with ipilimumab 
(ORR, 58.9% vs 19.0%; CR, 17.2% vs 4.4%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/291536/2018  
Page 123/128 
 
 
 
Nivolumab monotherapy has shown a statistically significant improvement in OS vs Ipilimumab 
monotherapy (HR = 0.63 [98% CI: 0.48, 0.81]) as well as a significant improvement in PFS (HR=0.54, 
95% CI: 0.45, 0.66). ORR rates were 44.6% and 19.0%, respectively. 
Based on descriptive analyses, Nivo+Ipi vs Nivo has shown a numeric difference in OS favouring the 
combination (median not reached in both groups; HR 0.88, 95% CI: [0.69, 1.12]). Corresponding 
results for median PFS were 11.73 in the combination group vs 6.87 in the Nivo mono group (HR: 
0.76, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.94). ORR rates were 58.9% and 44.6%, respectively. 
Sensitivity analyses as well as subgroup analyses support the main results. An improvement of OS was 
seen in both BRAF mutated subjects (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.66) as well as BRAF WT subjects (HR 
0.62, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.80) for the Nivo+Ipi vs Ipi monotherapy. There was also a lower risk of death 
for Nivo+Ipi versus Ipi monotherapy at all predefined levels of tumour PD-L1 expression (e.g. HR 
0.604 95%CI 0.42-0.84 vs HR 0.53 95%CI 0.38-0.74 with a cut-off of 1%). 
Updated study results at the data cut-off of May 2017, with +9 months additional follow up (OS data at 
3-years available) and results from study CA209069 showed consistent results.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is uncertainty with regards to the subset of the patient population determined as having tumour 
PD-L1 negative or positive and the selection of these patients. In patients with PD-L1 low expression, 
the use of the combination appears to offer better results than those with a higher expression on PD-
L1 when comparing nivo+ipi to nivo monotherapy (HR 0.74 95%CI 0.52-1.06 vs HR 1.03 95%CI 0.72-
1.48 with a cut-off of 1%). This finding means that in those patients designated as having tumour PD-
L1 expression (cut-off >1%) no benefit of the treatment combination over nivolumab monotherapy in 
terms of OS has been established. Based on the current data, a clear definition of the cutoff for PD-L1 
tumour expression is lacking and hence, it is not feasible to select patients who could mostly benefit 
from treatment, despite the available IHC assay (measuring PD-L1 tumour cell expression only). There 
is uncertainty as to how this test would be used in a clinical setting taking into account the variability 
and heterogeneity in the expression of PD-L1 in tumour and immune cells as well as the reproducibility 
of the method used in the different laboratories. Furthermore, it is of note that a 10% higher 
antitumour activity is exhibited by the combination even in the subgroup of PD-L1>1%. The landmark 
analysis of OS from month 6 by response status is pointing towards a promising survival for those 
patients who achieve a response (CR or PR). Therefore, combination treatment may be beneficial for 
some patients with high PD-L1 tumour expression as well. Therefore, the indication was not restricted 
based on PD-L1 tumour expression and a statement to specify the treatment effect was included in 
4.1. Efficacy results at all predefined levels of tumour PD-L1 expression are adequately reflected in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The final safety data from study CA2090672 (database lock (DBL) of 13-Sep-2016) are reported below 
(refer to EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0032). The safety of the nivolumab and ipilimumab used in combination 
is consistent with the known effects of the two products as used in monotherapy. However, a higher 
frequency and severe toxicity were observed in the treated combination group.  
The median duration of therapy was 2.83 months in the NIVO+IPI group. 87.8% of treated subjects in 
the NIVO group received ≥  90% of the planned dose intensity, which was similar to ipilimumab in the 
IPI group (88.4%) and greater than nivolumab and ipilimumab in the NIVO+IPI group (69.0% and 
70.6%, respectively).

Any grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 99.7% of subjects in the NIVO group, 99.7% 
in the NIVO+IPI group, and 99.0% of subjects in the IPI group. Any grade drug-related AEs were 
reported in 86.3% of subjects in the NIVO group, 95.8% in the NIVO+IPI group, and 86.2% of 
subjects in the IPI group. In the NIVO+IPI group the most frequently reported AEs (≥  20% of 
subjects) were diarrhoea (54.0%), fatigue (51.8%), nausea (43.8%), pyrexia (39.9%), pruritus 
(39.0%), rash (32.9%), vomiting (31.3%), decreased appetite (29.4%), headache (25.6%), cough 
(24.3%), dyspnoea (23.0%), arthralgia (21.4%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
(20.8%).  
Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 50.8% of subjects in the NIVO group, 72.2% 
in the NIVO+IPI group, and 57.9% of subjects in the IPI group. In the NIVO+IPI group the most 
frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs (≥  5% of subjects) were lipase increased (12.5%), diarrhoea 
(11.2%), increased ALT (9.3%), colitis (8.3%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (6.7%), 
and fatigue (6.4%). 
SAEs were reported in 42.5% of subjects in the NIVO group, 71.2% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group, 
and 55.0% of subjects in the IPI group. The overall frequencies of SAEs and drug-related SAEs were 
lowest in the NIVO group and highest in the NIVO+IPI group. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 33.2%, 
53.4%, and 40.5% of subjects in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. In the NIVO+IPI 
group, the most frequently reported SAEs were diarrhoea (10.5%), colitis (9.9%), and pyrexia (8.3%). 
As of the 13-Sep-2016 database lock, a total of 141 (45%), 127 (40.6%), and 195 (62.7%) deaths 
were reported in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI groups, respectively. Disease progression was the most 
common cause of death for all groups, including deaths occurring within 30 days of last dose and 
deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. No additional drug-related deaths were reported within 
100 days of the last dose of study drug since the database lock for the CA209067 Interim CSR. 
In the final CSR four drug-related deaths were reported >100 days after last dose of study drug, in the 
NIVO+IPI group.AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 18.2% of subjects in the NIVO group, 
47.0% of subjects in the NIVO+IPI group and 25.1% of subjects in the IPI group. 
The overall frequency of pulmonary select drug related AEs was greater in the NIVO+IPI group (7.7%) 
compared to the NIVO and IPI monotherapy groups (2.2% and 3.2%, respectively). In the interim 
study report of CA209067, a total of 8 out 13 deaths classified as “other” reason were 
pulmonary/respiratory events. Most pneumonitis cases resolved with appropriate immunosuppressant 
therapy. By contrary, 3 cases of pulmonary embolism led to death in the overall safety database. 
Pulmonary toxicity, including pulmonary embolism, are relevant toxicities associated with this 
treatment combination. These are already reflected in the SmPC to inform physicians and in the RMP 
for further follow up. 
Cardiac adverse events have also been reported with combination therapy. Tachycardia and atrial 
fibrillation were the most frequently reported. The incidence of cardiac arrest/failure was low and 
similar to that of ipilimumab. A precautionary statement is included in the SmPC recommending 
periodic monitoring (SmPC Section 4.4). 
The immunogenic potential of nivolumab monotherapy was low. The immunogenicity of nivolumab 
increased when nivolumab was used in combination with ipilimumab. However, no impact on the 
efficacy and/or safety of the presence of antibodies against nivolumab or ipilimumab could be 
observed.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main uncertainties have been described previously in the initial marketing authorisation of 
ipilimumab and in the variation II-03. They have been included in the RMP. There is limited data on the 
incidence of immune-related adverse reactions and how they are managed in clinical practice. Hence a 
post-marketing epidemiologic cohort study is ongoing to address this concern. In addition, the results 
of two multi-site retrospective observational studies in patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma receiving ipilimumab as first line therapy in a community practice setting will provide 
further evidence on the outcomes of subjects prescribed 3 mg/kg in the first-line setting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Disease progression was the most 
common cause of death for all 
groups, including deaths occurring 
within 30 days of last dose and 
deaths occurring within 100 days 
of last dose. 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit observed in terms of PFS and OS for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
compared to ipilimumab as monotherapy in the overall population is considered clinically relevant in 
the target population. This also holds true for the various subgroups, including patients with different 
levels of PD-L1 expression. An exception is the comparison of combination treatment vs nivolumab 
monotherapy in patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression for which no difference in PFS and OS 
was observed. However, a 10% difference in ORR was observed which may be of clinical relevance.  
The safety of the combination is consistent with what has been observed in the monotherapy 
treatments. No new ADRs have been identified. Important identified risks associated with the 
combination regimen include immune-mediated adverse reactions of pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, 
endocrinopathies, nephritis, and rash. Nevertheless, the tolerability and severity of the AEs is clearly 
worse as, overall, there was significantly higher rate of AEs, grade 3-4 AEs and serious AEs observed in 
the combination arms compared to the monotherapy arms. This increased toxicity is reflected in the 
higher rate of discontinuations due to AEs.  
Given the increased toxicity with the combination and the absence of an OS benefit of the combination 
versus nivolumab monotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥1%) a precautionary 
statement is included in section 4.4. Before initiating treatment with the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab, physicians are advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient, taking into 
consideration the anti-tumour activity and tolerability of the combination relative to nivolumab 
monotherapy (see section 4.4, 48 and 5.1). This is acceptable. 
Additional proposed revisions to section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2 were all assessed within previous 
procedures for Opdivo and were found to be acceptable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in adult patients with metastatic melanoma 
are considered to outweigh the risks.

Page 127/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Since there are concerns on the use of tumour expression of PD-L1 as a marker, especially its use as a 
reliable tool in clinical practice to select a population to be treated, and there is a lack of appropriate 
evidence-based rationale for a cut-off value, the indication was not be restricted according to the 
expression of tumour PD-L1. Hence, the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is indicated for the 
treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. Relative to nivolumab 
monotherapy, an increase in OS and PFS for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is 
established only in patients with low tumour PD-L1 expression. This information is reflected in section 
4.1, with a reference to sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Yervoy in combination with nivolumab for the treatment of advanced (unresectable 
or metastatic) melanoma in adults is positive.

Introduction 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This application is made to support the new indication as first-line treatment of patients with advanced 
gastric  cancer.  The  applicant  has  performed  one  pivotal  phase  III  study  (ML  17032)  and  one 
supportive phase II study (M 66302) for this indication. 
Gastric Cancer 
Despite a sharp worldwide decline in incidence and a reduction in mortality during the last 50 years, 
gastric  cancer  remains  the  world’s  second  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  to  lung  cancer1  with  a 
remarkable  variation  across  geographic  regions.  In  Japan,  Korea,  China,  and  certain  countries  in 
Central  and  South  America,  the  incidence  is  20  to  95  cases  per  100,000  men.  The  incidence  in 
Western Europe ranges from 12 to 37 cases per 100,000 in men and is about 50% lower in women2. 
To date, the only potentially curative treatment for gastric cancer is surgery. Although the prognosis 
for gastric cancer is generally poor, better survival rates are seen in Japanese patients. An international 
comparison,  based  on  population  based  cancer  registries  in  developing  countries  and  Western 
developed  countries,  shows  a  five  year  relative  survival  rate  of  about  20%  while  it  is  40%–60%  in 
Japan3  most  likely  owing  to  an  earlier  detection.  Patients  with  unresectable  disease  due  to  locally 
advanced growth or metastatic spread have a poor prognosis, with overall 5-year survival in the range 
of 5% to 15%. For those patients, and for patients with recurrent disease after surgery, the main option 
is chemotherapy as the efficacy of chemotherapy with palliative intent compared with best supportive 
care in patients with advanced gastric cancer has been established in terms of overall survival4, 5. 
Comparable to oesophageal, pancreatic, liver, colon and rectum cancers, 5-FU monotherapy of gastric 
cancer  with  an  antineoplastic  activity  around  20%  (ORR)  was  historically  the  cornerstone  of 
chemotherapy treatment but has been replaced continuously (with the exception of about 6% usage of 
5-FU  monotherapy  in  5  major  EU  countries  -  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Spain,  and  the  UK-  as 
mentioned  by  the  clinical  expert  of  the  applicant  referring  to  data  of  Synovate  Cancer  Therapy 
Monitor)  by  5-FU  based  2  to  3  drug  combinations.  However,  there  is  no  unequivocal  evidence  for 
combination treatment, or specifically Cisplatin/5-FU combinations, prolonging OS as compared to 5-
FU  monotherapy.  Please  note  that  the  quoted  comparative  trials  comparing  best  supportive  care  vs. 
chemotherapy  did  actually  investigate  combination  treatment  (in  detail  5-FU,  epirubicin  plus 
methotrexate). 
Accordingly,  the  NCCN  (National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network)  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in 
Oncology  –  v.  1.2006,  Gastric  Cancer,  recommends  that:  “Whenever  possible,  patients  should  be 
enrolled  in  clinical  trials.  Outside  of  clinical  trials,  patients  may  be  treated  with  a  cisplatin-based, 
oxaliplatin-based,  5-FU-based,  taxane-based,  irinotecan-based,  or  ECF  combination  chemotherapy. 
The decision of whether to offer best supportive care alone or with chemotherapy should be based on 
the  patient’s  performance  status.  Patients  should  be  offered  only  best  supportive  care  if  they  have  a 
Karnofsky performance score of 60 or less…” 
The  ESMO  recommendations6  read  in  similar  lines:  “Patients  with  stage  IV  disease  should  be 
considered for palliative chemotherapy. Combination regimens incorporating cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil 
with  or  without  anthracyclines  are  generally  used.  Epirubicin  50  mg/m2,  Cisplatin  60  mg/m2  and 
protracted venous infusion 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2/day (ECF) is one among the most active and well 
tolerated  combination  chemotherapy  regimens.  Alternate  regimens  including  oxaliplatin,  irinotecan, 
docetaxel, and oral fluoropyrimidines can be considered.”

Clinical aspects 
In  order  to  demonstrate  efficacy  of  capecitabine  (in  combination  with  Cisplatin)  a  multi-centre, 
international, randomised, open label phase III clinical trial comparing 1000 mg/m2 Capecitabine bid 
po (for day 1-14) plus 80 mg/m2 Cisplatin (day 1 i.v.) for a 3 weeks cycle (Capecitabine arm) to a 5-
FU/Cisplatin arm consisting in 800 mg/m2/day continuous infusion of 5-FU (day 1-5) plus 80 mg/m2 
Cisplatin  (day  1  i.v.)  for  a  3  weeks  cycle  as  first  line  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  and/or 
metastatic  gastric  cancer  has  been  submitted  as  the  pivotal  trial  of  this  application.  Furthermore,  an 
open  label,  non-comparative  trial  investigating  Capecitabine  monotherapy  as  first  line  treatment  of 
advanced  and/or  metastatic  gastric  cancer  has  been  submitted  as  supportive  data  as  well  as  results 
from published trials.  
Clinical pharmacology 
 2.1 
Data from an older publication7 on a human xenograft model in mice which shows additive effects in 
gastric  cancer  while  Cisplatin  toxicity  (nephrotoxicity,  ototoxicity)  is  not  additive  to  capecitabine 
toxicity. 
Table 1: 
Anti-tumour activity of Xeloda in a Human Xenograft model in Mice 
Ethnic factors (Caucasian vs. Japanese patients) of Capecitabine PK (and its metabolites) have already 
been assessed in the context of a FUM, with the result labelled in sec. 5.2 of the SPC8, and published9. 
PK interactions of Capecitabine with Cisplatin as well as PD effect of escalated dosages are available 
from a publication10 in 21 patients with locally recurrent or metastatic head and neck carcinoma. Three 
dose  levels  (dose  of  Cisplatin  and  capecitabine  in  mg/m2,  Cisplatin  at  day  1  of  a  21  days  cycle,

8   “Following oral administration of 825 mg/m2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days, Japanese patients (n=18) had about 
36% lower Cmax and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than Caucasian patients (n=22). Japanese patients had also about 
25% lower Cmax and 34% lower AUC for FBAL than Caucasian patients. The clinical relevance of these differences is 
unknown. No significantdifferences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU).”

Capecitabine b.i.d. for 14 days of a 21 days cycle) - level 1 80 and 1000 (three patients); level 2 100 
and  1000 (12 patients); and level  3,  100  and  1125  (five patients) – were investigated. Dose limiting 
toxicity at  first cycle  was observed starting with level 2. Based on the results  the authors  concluded 
that  there  was  no  evidence  of  pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic  relationships  with  the  drugs  and 
metabolites investigated.  
The  lack  of  PK  interaction  of  capecitabine  with  other  substances  has  been  confirmed  in  further 
publications: In a trial investigating escalating doses of capecitabine (500, 825, 1000 and 1250 mg/m2 
b.i.d.) each in combination with 50 and 60 mg/m2 Epirubicin and Cisplatin every three weeks (ECC) in 
32 patients with inoperable oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma, the authors concluded11 that Cmax and 
AUC0-∞ for capecitabine, DFCR, and DFUR were similar to those observed in previous capecitabine 
monotherapy  trials.  A  Capecitabine  dose  of  1000  mg/m2  was  recommended  and  a  phase  III  trial 
comparing ECF and ECC seemed to be justified. 
A phase I trial in solid tumour patients12 investigated Capecitabine in combination with Cisplatin and 
Docetaxel at overall 6 dose levels with small or even very small increments13. Of note is that Cisplatin 
and Docetaxel were repeated every 7 days while capecitabine was administered continuously (b.i.d.) 
for 14 days with one week rest period (cycle length 3 weeks). Main conclusions of this trial were that 
the recommended docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine dose for phase II studies is 27/27/825 mg/m2. 
An observed alteration in total and ultrafiltrate platinum disposition on cycle 2 compared with cycle 1 
may  be  inherent  to  sequential  Cisplatin  administration;  however,  prior  treatment  with  Capecitabine 
could not be ruled out as a factor. 
2.2. Clinical efficacy 
The clinical assessment is based on one pivotal phase III study (ML 17032) and on one supportive 
phase II study (M 66302). Published data are also discussed as supportive to the indication. 
2.2.1 Main Study ML 17032 
This  was  an  open,  phase  III  study  performed  in  42  centres  in  the  12  countries:  China  (14  centres, 
including  1  in  Hong  Kong),  Brazil  (7),  Korea  (4),  Mexico  (4),  Russia  (4),  Argentina  (2),  Peru  (2), 
Malaysia (1), Colombia (1), Guatemala (1), Panama (1), and Uruguay (1). 
Approximately 300 patients were to be enrolled, 150 in each of the 2 treatment groups. All study sites 
and investigators were familiar with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and clinical audits 
were conducted by the Clinical Quality Assurance Department of Roche. The primary objective of this 
study  was  to  demonstrate  that  capecitabine  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  non-inferior  to  5-FU  in 
combination with cisplatin in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated patients 
with advanced and/or metastatic gastric cancer. The secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy 
profiles of the 2 treatment groups in terms of overall response rate, complete response rate, duration of 
survival,  time  to  progression,  duration  of  response,  and  time  to  response,  if  PFS  non-inferiority  is 
accepted and to compare the safety profiles of the 2 treatment groups. 
Patients  between  18  and  75  years  of  age  with  histologically  confirmed  measurable  advanced  and/or 
metastatic  gastric  adenocarcinoma  not  previously  treated  with  chemotherapy  (except  adjuvant  or 
neoadjuvant treatment completed at least 6 months prior to enrollment), having creatinine clearance > 
60  mL/min,  Karnofsky  performance  status  > 70%  and  a  life  expectancy  of  at  least  3  months,  were 
eligible for entry into this study: 
After randomization to 1:1 groups the patients received either: 
- capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 bid po) from evening of day 1 through morning of day 15 and cisplatin 
(80 mg/m2 2-hour infusion with pre- and posthyper-hydration) on day 1. A 3-week cycle (2 weeks of 
treatment, 1-week rest) for at least 2 cycles. 
11    Annals of Oncology 13: 1469-79, 2002 
12    Clin Cancer Res 11: 5942-49, 2005 
13    The first dose level (DL1) consisted of 20 mg/m2 docetaxel, 20 mg/m2 cisplatin, and twice a day capecitabine at 600 
mg/m2/dose. DL2 to DL5 were 20, 20, and 825 mg/m2; 27, 20, and 825 mg/m2; 27, 27, and 825 mg/m2; and 36, 27, 825 
mg/m2 for docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine, respectively.

- cisplatin (80 mg/m2 2-hour infusion with pre- and posthyper-hydration) on day 1, 5-FU (800 mg/m2 
per day, continuous infusion) on days 1 to 5. A 3-week cycle, for at least 2 cycles. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that capecitabine in combination with cisplatin 
(capecitabine/cisplatin) is non-inferior to 5-FU in combination with cisplatin (5-FU/cisplatin) in terms 
of  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  in  previously  untreated  patients  with  advanced  and/or  metastatic 
gastric cancer. 
The secondary objectives were: 
− To  compare  the  efficacy  of  the  2  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  overall  response  rate,  complete 
response rate, duration of survival, time to progression, duration of response, and time to response, if 
PFS non-inferiority is accepted, 
−To compare the safety profiles of the 2 treatment groups. 
All  patient  analysis  populations  were  defined  and  determined  prior  to  database  closure  for  the  final 
analysis. One patient population was defined for the safety analysis (safety population) and two for the 
efficacy  analysis,  namely  the  ITT  and  PP  populations.  All  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics 
were summarized and all efficacy parameters were analyzed for both the ITT and PP populations. The 
applicant  has chosen the  PP  population as  the  primary analysis  population  but the results  have  been 
counted  for  the  ITT  population  as  well  and  this  critical  assessment  is  mainly  based  on  the  ITT 
population. 
Results 
A  total  of  316  patients  were  enrolled  into  Study  ML17032  at  42  centres  in  12  countries.  The  first 
patient was randomized on 30 April 2003, and the last patient was randomized on 18 January 2005. Of 
the 316 patients, 160 were randomized to the capecitabine/cisplatin treatment group and 156 to the 5-
FU/cisplatin treatment group. By the clinical cut-off date of 04 November 2005, 216 patients had died. 
Baseline demographic and tumour characteristics at baseline are summarised in tables 2 and 3. 
Potential  prognostic  factors  such  stage,  tumour  histology,  lymph  node  involvement,  metastatic  sites, 
number  of  metastasis,  or  previous  anticancer  treatment  were  overall  evenly  distributed  in  both 
treatment arms, both in the ITT as well as in the PP population.

Efficacy results 
The results of primary objectives are evaluated both for the PP-population and for the ITT population. 
The  hazard  ratio  of  capecitabine/cisplatin  vs  5-FU/cisplatin  was  estimated  by  a  Cox  regression 
stratified by region and adjusted for pre-specified covariates. In the PP population, the point estimate 
of  the  hazard  ratio  (capecitabine/cisplatin  vs  5-FU/cisplatin)  was  0.85  and  the  upper  limit  of  the  2-
sided 95% CI was 1.11, which is below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.25. The finding 
was  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.005).  Similar  results  were  obtained  for  the  ITT  population:  point 
estimate, 0.84; upper limit of 2-sided 95% CI, 1.09; p = 0.003.

Efficacy Parameters 
For  all  time-to-event  parameters,  similar  results  were  obtained  with  and  without  adjustment  for  pre-
specified covariates. The hazard ratios (capecitabine/cisplatin vs 5-FU/cisplatin) were similar for PFS, 
duration of survival, and time to progression, ranging from 0.80 to 0.88.

Results in pre-specified subgroups (prior chemotherapy, sex, age, Karnofsky score, bone metastases, 
number  of  metastatic  sites,  serum  bilirubin,  geographic  region,  and  ethnicity)  confirmed  the  overall 
results. No interaction was observed between treatment and subgroup variables. The hazard ratios (or 
odds  ratios)  were  generally  similar  across  subgroups,  with  the  majority  favouring  capecitabine/ 
cisplatin over 5-FU/cisplatin. These sub-group analyses show the internal consistency and robustness 
of the results. 
The  median  duration  of  survival  was  slightly  longer  (10.4  months  vs  8.9  months)  and  the  1-year 
survival rate  was  slightly higher in  the capecitabine/cisplatin  group  than in the 5-FU/cisplatin  group 
(36.1% vs 34.8%). 
The results for duration of survival in the PP population were similar to those in the ITT population. 
The  log-rank  test  of  the  equality  of  the  survival  functions  of  the  2  treatment  groups  was  not 
statistically  significant  (p  =  0.2430  in  the  ITT  population)  but  the  Kaplan-Meier  plot  of  duration  of 
survival  showed  a  separation  of  the  curves  for  the  capecitabine/cisplatin  and  5-FU/cisplatin  groups. 
Survival  rates  were  greater  for  the  capecitabine/cisplatin  group  than  for  the  5-FU/cisplatin  group 
across the study period except at about month 14. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  plot  of duration  of  survival for the PP  population  was  similar  to that for the  ITT 
population. 
The log-rank test of the equality of the survival functions of the 2 treatment groups was statistically 
significant in the ITT population (p = 0.0140) and in the PP population as well (p = 0.0094). 
Tumour response (RECIST) 
The tumour responses were assessed according to RECIST criteria. In results for the ITT population, 
the capecitabine/cisplatin group had a higher overall response rate (40.6%) than in the 5-FU/cisplatin 
group (28.8%) (p = 0.0295, stratified analysis). Patients in the capecitabine/cisplatin group had 1.41 
times the chance of achieving an overall response compared with patients in the 5-FU/cisplatin group. 
A similar pattern was observed for partial response. Three complete responses were observed in the 
capecitabine/cisplatin group, and 4 in the 5-FU/cisplatin group. Similar results were observed for the 
PP population. 
ORR was – in both arms – considerably smaller with the difference no longer reaching statistical 
significance following the independent assessment of the IRC: The overall response rates were 27.5% 
and 23.1% in the capecitabine/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin groups, respectively (p = 0.3493) in the 
ITT and 31.7% and 25.5% (p = 0.2672) in the PP population.

Duration of response was determined in those patients who had RECIST confirmed partial or complete 
responses (in the ITT population, 65 in the capecitabine/cisplatin group and 45 in the 5-FU/cisplatin 
group).  The  median duration  of  response was slightly  longer (7.6  months  vs  6.2  months)  and the  6-
month  rate  of  no  progression  or  death  was  higher  in  the  capecitabine/cisplatin  group  than  in  the  5-

that the survival curves for the 2 treatment groups were significantly different, a Kaplan-Meier plot of 
time  to  response  showed  a  separation  of  the  curves  for  the  capecitabine/cisplatin  and  5-FU/cisplatin 
groups  from  1.5  months  (the  time  of  the  first  tumour  assessment)  onward.  At  all  time  points  after 
month 2, the response rates were approximately 10% greater in the capecitabine/cisplatin group than 
in the 5-FU/cisplatin group

2.2.2. Efficacy results from Study M66302 
This was an open-label, multi-center phase II study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
capecitabine as first line monotherapy in previously untreated Korean patients with advanced and/or 
metastatic gastric cancer. The primary efficacy analysis consisted of the overall response rate which 
was the time from the start of treatment to progressive disease or end of study. The secondary 
parameters were time to disease progression, duration of response and time to response. A total of 45 
patients were enrolled in this study but after one withdrawal (the patient withdrew consent) the 
safety/ITT population included 44 patients.  
This study is considered as a supportive one because of safety parameters. 
The main efficacy findings of trial M66302 can be summarised as follows: 
•  Objective response rate in the ITT population was 34% (CI: 20%-50%), 36% in the PP 
population. 
•  The median time to disease progression was 95 days (3.1 months) both in the ITT and in the 
PP population. 
•  Median duration of response was 251 days (8.4 months) both in the ITT and in the PP 
population 
•  OS has not been reported (and is/was obviously also not monitored) 
2.2.3. Published data 
Results from two Japanese phase II trials investigated a Capecitabine dosage of 828 mg/m2 twice daily 
for 3 weeks of a 4-weeks cycle were provided. In the first14, the response rate was 19% among the 31 
evaluable patients and 24% in the subset of 25 chemotherapy-naïve patients. In the other trial15, the 
response rate was 26% among the 55 evaluable (chemotherapy-naïve) patients and 23% in the intent-
to-treat (ITT) population. 
Two published Korean and a Chinese trial investigated the combination of Capecitabine and Cisplatin 
in advanced or recurrent gastric cancer patients. Rough details on design and result are provided in

In addition to these 3 published Capecitabine/Cisplatin phase II combination trials in advanced gastric 
cancer the applicant is reviewing overall 7 published phase II combination trials in which the 
combination partner of Capecitabine was not Cisplatin but Docetaxel (3 trials19, 20, 21), Oxaliplatin (2 
trials22, 23), Paclitaxel, and Irinotecan (1 trial each24, 25). The ORRs in these trials are high ranging from

Major  efficacy  and  safety  results  of  the  REAL-2  trial  are  presented.  Table  10  shows  the  result 
concerning  overall  survival.  As  the  95%-confidence  interval  for  EOX  does  not  include  1,  the 
conclusion  can  be  derived  that  EOX  is  statistically  significantly  superior  to  ECF  in  terms  of  OS.  In 
table 11 referring to ORR shows only minor differences in the study arm. The results in tables 12 and 
13 indicate a lower toxicity of Oxaliplatin vs. Cisplatin while the safety differences between 5-FU and 
Capecitabine  appear  negligible.  With  41.7%  and  51.1%  grade  3/4  neutropenia  both  Cisplatin  triple 
combination arms can be characterised as of pronounced myelotoxicity.

2. 3. Clinical Safety 
The main data source for safety information for capecitabine for the first line treatment of advanced 
gastric cancer comes from the pivotal study ML 17032. In this study, all patients received treatment 
for at least two 3-week cycles in one of two treatment groups mentioned above. In addition, detailed 
safety data is also received from the supportive phase II study (M 66302).  
Safety results from Study ML 17032 
Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study treatment phase and for 28 days after the 
last  intake  or  infusion  of  study  treatment.  Related  safety  parameters  were  dose  modifications  and 
premature  withdrawals  from  treatment  due  to  adverse  events  and  concomitant  treatments  given  for 
AEs.  
Adverse events were reported for nearly all patients (96%) in both treatment groups. Most of the 
patients had treatment-related AEs, and half had at least one severe or life-threatening AE. There was 
no difference between the two treatment groups according to the percentage of patients with severe or 
life-threatening adverse events or the percentage with the adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
trial treatment. 
The capecitabine/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin groups were similar in terms of the percentages of 
patients with all-grade adverse events, severe or life-threatening (grade 3/4) adverse events, and 
adverse events leading to withdrawal from trial treatment. 
•  Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most frequent adverse events in both treatment 
groups. The spectrum of gastrointestinal adverse events associated with capecitabine/cisplatin 
was qualitatively similar to that observed with 5FU/cisplatin, with nausea and vomiting being 
the predominant gastrointestinal adverse events. All grade vomiting and stomatitis were less 
frequent with capecitabine/cisplatin than with 5-FU/cisplatin. 
•  All-grade hand–foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) was more frequent with 
capecitabine/cisplatin than with 5-FU/cisplatin (22% vs 4%) but led to discontinuation of trial 
treatment in only 1 patient (<1%) in the capecitabine/cisplatin group. 
•  Dose modifications due to adverse events were more frequent for capecitabine than for 5-FU 
(55% vs 41% of patients). However, treatment duration tended to be longer and the mean 
cumulative dose of cisplatin was higher in the capecitabine/cisplatin group than in the 5-
FU/cisplatin group. 
•  Death during treatment or within 28 days after the last dose of treatment occurred in 15 
patients in the capecitabine/cisplatin group and 10 in the 5-FU/cisplatin group. Of these, 7 
deaths in each of the 2 groups had causes other than gastric cancer/progressive disease. One 
death in the capecitabine/cisplatin group and 2 deaths in the 5-FU/cisplatin group were 
considered by the investigator to be drug related. 
•  Death within 60 days after the start of treatment occurred in 8 patients in the 
capecitabine/cisplatin group and 5 in the 5-FU/cisplatin group. Of these, 5 deaths in the 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capecitabine/cisplatin group and 3 deaths in the 5-FU/cisplatin group had causes other than 
gastric cancer/progressive disease. 
•  Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 10% of patients in the 
capecitabine/cisplatin group and 7% in the 5-FU/cisplatin group. 
•  There were no major differences between the treatment groups in laboratory results. The 2 
treatment groups were similar with regard to the percentages of patients with grade 3/4 
neutropenia/granulocytopenia (capecitabine/cisplatin, 27%; 5-FU/cisplatin, 25%) and grade 
3/4 anemia (capecitabine/cisplatin, 23%; 5-FU/cisplatin, 19%). All grade bilirubin increase 
was more frequent in the capecitabine/cisplatin group (31%) than in the 5-FU/cisplatin group 
(20%). However, grade 3/4 elevations of ALAT and ASAT were present in the 5-FU/cisplatin 
group but not in the capecitabine/cisplatin group. 
Safety results from Study M 66302 
Almost all patients reported at least one AE during treatment (41/44 patients, or 93.2%, reported 185 
adverse events), with the majority of these AEs being classified as related to treatment (119 events 
reported in 38, or 86.4%, of patients were drug-related) (Table 20). 
In the majority of patients (65.9% - 50.0%), treatment-related AEs were rated by investigators as being 
mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2). About sixteen percent of patients experienced grade 3 treatment-
related AEs (10 events reported by 7 patients). One (2.3%) patient reported life-threatening (grade 4) 
AE that was classified as being related to treatment. 
Among the most common AEs were those involving the gastrointestinal tract like nausea and 
diarrhoea as in the study ML 17032, while palmo-plantar syndrome was the most common single 
event.

Postmarketing Safety Data 
Since capecitabine first got the marketing authorisation in 1998, it is estimated that over 1 million 
patients have been treated with capecitabine. Post-marketing surveillance data accumulated for 
capecitabine since approval have been submitted in the form of Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs), summarizing the worldwide safety data on capecitabine for all indications. 
A Roche ADVENT Safety Database search (between 30-Apr-1998 and 08-Jan-2006) was performed 
for all capecitabine adverse event reports, including clinical trial cases considered to be unrelated to 
capecitabine by the reporting investigators, with one of the following indications: gastric cancer, 
gastric cancer stage III, gastric cancer stage IV, gastroesophageal cancer or metastatic gastric cancer. 
A total of 270 case reports with a total of 517 adverse events and 66 co-manifestations in 
268 patients, who were treated with capecitabine, were received. Of these 270 cases, 15 cases with 28 
events and 4 co-manifestations were considered to be non-serious. 
This is consistent with the findings in the 12th PSUR, covering the reporting period from 
November 1, 2004 to July 31, 2005, and included with the Renewal Application. No new safety 
signals were identified in this review period that necessitated a change to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC). 
The system organ class with the highest number of adverse events is “Gastrointestinal Disorders” 
followed by “Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders” and “General Disorders and Administration 
Site Conditions”. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhoea, palmo-plantar 
erythodysthesia, vomiting and nausea.

Overall Discussion and Benefit-Risk assessment 
5-FU/cisplatin  is  a  well-established  standard  combination  treatment  of  advanced  and/or  metastatic 
gastric cancer. Replacement of 5-FU by Capecitabine in this combination has only minimal effects on 
the safety of this combination. Concering efficacy, capecitabine is at least non-inferior with regard to 
the  primary  endpoint  of  the  trial,  PFS.  The  same  statement  applies  on  other  secondary  endpoint 
(including  OS)  and  “sensitivity  analysis”  (such  as  the  IRC  based  assessment  of  progression).  The 
efficacy results proved to be rather robust in several sets of analysis performed. 
In summary, considering also that Capecitabine is for oral (for 14 days) administration and 5-FU is for 
continuous  infusion  (for  5  days),  benefit-risk  relationship  of  Capecitabine/Cisplatin  is  “at  least 
comparable” to 5-FU/Cisplatin. Rather, there is some evidence that efficacy of Capecitabine/Cisplatin 
may be even better (e.g. ORR based on investigators’ assessment or the range of the different 95%-CIs 
of the primary and secondary endpoints). As 5-FU/Cisplatin represents standard of care of advanced 
gastric cancer so that Capecitabine/Cisplatin has at least the potential to improve standard of care (at 
minimum  by  replacing  5-FU  continuous  infusion  by  [ambulatory]  intake  of  tablets  without 
recognisably affecting safety). 
In study Real-2 in ECF, Cisplatin can be replaced by Oxaliplatin, 5-FU can be replaced by Xeloda and 
EOX is statistically significantly superior to ECF in terms of OS. In addition there was a trend to an 
improved  safety  profile  in  Oxaliplatin  arms.  At  both  dosages  of  200  mg/m2  5-FU  and  625  mg/m2 
Xeloda had a comparable safety profile.  
Taking into account also the published trials it could even be argued that restricting capecitabine in the 
treatment  of  advanced  gastric  cancer  patient  to  the  combination  partner  cisplatin  is  a  suboptimal 
regulatory result. Capecitabine/Cisplatin reflects appropriately the well established character of 5-FU 
and  the  already  broad  experience  with  Capecitabine  in  advanced  gastric  cancer  not  limited  to  the 
Cisplatin combination only but to platinum regimens. 
Both  the  two  published  Japanese  phase  II  trials  as  well  as  the  submitted  trial  M66302  characterise 
Capecitabine  as  an  active  substance  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  and/or  metastatic  chemotherapy 
naïve gastric cancer patients deserving further investigation (in the year 2002, when trial M66302 was 
performed).  This  is  no  surprise  in  view  of  Capecitabine  being  an  oral  pro-drug  of  5-FU,  5-FU  and 
Capecitabine  are  active  as  monotherapy  in  colorectal  cancer,  and  5-FU  is  the  backbone  of  the 
treatment of  advanced intestinal cancers since decades. However, the evidence from these trials was 
not sufficient to support a monotherapy indication for Xeloda in gastric cancer. 
Also the safety profile of Xeldoda in advanced gastric cancer is no surprise. For underlining the well 
established character of Xeloda’s safety profile, AEs frequently reported in (the phase II) trial M66302 
were compared with SPC statements. The differences are minor. 
The MAH was requested to perform a meta-analysis of all finalised phase III Roche sponsored trials 
investigating  Capecitabine.  Subject  of  the  meta-anlysis  should  be  relevant  fluoropyrimidine  AEs 
(HFS,  Gastrointestinal  AEs,  Grade  3/4  neutropenia).  Factors  to  be  analysed  should  comprise 
capecitabine  starting  dose,  cumulative  capecitabine  dose  and/or  treatment  duration,  combination 
partner, intend and/or line of treatment. 
The MAH has revised the section 4.8 of the SPC adverse effects. Concerning monotherapy (adjuvant 
colon  and treatment  of advanced  colorectal) this simplification  has  actually already  taken place. For 
the new posology applied for (Xeloda in combination with platinum regimen) it is considered that AEs 
of Xeloda in these combinations are clinically relevant and should be described.

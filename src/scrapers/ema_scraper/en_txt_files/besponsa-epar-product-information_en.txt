CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
BESPONSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory 
CD22-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Adult patients with 
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL should have 
failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
BESPONSA should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of 
cancer therapy and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available.
When considering the use of BESPONSA as a treatment for relapsed or refractory B cell ALL,
baseline CD22 positivity of > 0% using a validated and sensitive assay is required prior to initiating 
treatment (see section 5.1).
For patients with circulating lymphoblasts, cytoreduction with a combination of hydroxyurea, steroids, 
and/or vincristine to a peripheral blast count ≤ 10,000/mm3 is recommended prior to the first dose. 
Pre-medication with a corticosteroid, antipyretic, and antihistamine is recommended prior to dosing 
(see section 4.4).
For patients with a high tumour burden, pre-medication to reduce uric acid levels and hydration is 
recommended prior to dosing (see section 4.4).
Patients should be observed during, and for at least 1 hour after the end of infusion for symptoms of 
infusion related reactions (see section 4.4).
Posology
2
BESPONSA should be administered in 3- to 4-week cycles. 
For patients proceeding to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the recommended duration of 
treatment is 2 cycles. A third cycle may be considered for those patients who do not achieve a 
complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) and 
minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after 2 cycles (see section 4.4). For patients not proceeding 
to HSCT, a maximum of 6 cycles may be administered. Any patients who do not achieve a CR/CRi 
within 3 cycles should discontinue treatment.
Table 1 shows the recommended dosing regimens.
For the first cycle, the recommended total dose of BESPONSA for all patients is 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle, 
given as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2). Cycle 1 is 
3 weeks in duration but may be extended to 4 weeks if the patient achieves a CR or CRi, and/or to 
allow recovery from toxicity.
For subsequent cycles, the recommended total dose of BESPONSA is 1.5 mg/m2 per cycle given as 
3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.5 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who achieve a 
CR/CRi or 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle given as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 
15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who do not achieve a CR/CRi. Subsequent cycles are 4 weeks in duration.

resolution of any extramedullary disease.
e 7-day treatment-free interval starting on Day 21.
Dose modifications
Dose modification of BESPONSA may be required based on individual safety and tolerability (see 
section 4.4). Management of some adverse drug reactions may require dosing interruptions and/or 
dose reductions, or permanent discontinuation of BESPONSA (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If the dose is 
reduced due to BESPONSA-related toxicity, the dose should not be re-escalated.
3
Table 2 and Table 3 show the dose modification guidelines for haematological and
non-haematological toxicities, respectively. BESPONSA doses within a treatment cycle (i.e. Days 8 
and/or 15) do not need to be interrupted due to neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, but dosing 
interruptions within a cycle are recommended for non-haematological toxicities.

≥ 50 × 109/La 
ANC was < 1 × 109/L and/or 
platelet count was 
< 50 × 109/La
Toxicity and dose modification(s)
If ANC decreases, interrupt the next cycle of treatment until 
recovery of ANC to ≥ 1 × 109/L.
If platelet count decreases, interrupt the next cycle of treatment 
until platelet count recovers to ≥ 50 × 109/La.
If ANC and/or platelet count decreases, interrupt the next cycle 
of treatment until at least one of the following occurs:
- ANC and platelet count recover to at least baseline levels for 
the prior cycle, or
- ANC recovers to ≥ 1 × 109/L and platelet count recovers 
to ≥ 50 × 109/La, or
- Stable or improved disease (based on most recent bone 
marrow assessment) and the ANC and platelet count 
decrease is considered to be due to the underlying disease 
(not considered to be BESPONSA-related toxicity). 
Abbreviation: ANC=absolute neutrophil count.
a Platelet count used for dosing must be independent of blood transfusion.

Dose modification(s)
Interrupt the next dose (maintain a minimum of 6 days 
between doses).
Omit the next dose within the cycle. 
Once adequate recovery is achieved, decrease the total dose by 
25% for the subsequent cycle. If further dose modification is 
required, then reduce the number of doses to 2 per cycle for 
subsequent cycles. If a 25% decrease in the total dose followed 
by a decrease to 2 doses per cycle is not tolerated, then 
permanently discontinue treatment.
Consider permanent discontinuation of BESPONSA.
No adjustment to the starting dose is required based on age (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with hepatic impairment defined by total 
bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (see section 5.2). There is limited safety information available in 
patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN and AST/ALT > 2.5 × ULN prior to dosing. Interrupt dosing 
until recovery of total bilirubin to ≤ 1.5 × ULN and AST/ALT to ≤ 2.5 × ULN prior to each dose 
unless due to Gilbert’s syndrome or haemolysis. Permanently discontinue treatment if total bilirubin 
does not recover to ≤ 1.5 × ULN or AST/ALT does not recover to ≤ 2.5 × ULN (see Table 3 and 
section 4.4).
Renal impairment
No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60-89 mL/min, 30-59 mL/min, or 15-29 mL/min, 
respectively) (see section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of BESPONSA have not been studied in 
patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of BESPONSA in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established.
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.
Method of administration
BESPONSA is for intravenous use. The infusion must be administered over 1 hour.
BESPONSA should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. 
BESPONSA must be reconstituted and diluted before administration. For instructions on 
reconstitution and dilution of BESPONSA before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

-
-
Patients who have experienced prior confirmed severe or ongoing venoocclusive liver 
disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS).
Patients with serious ongoing hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, 
active hepatitis).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hepatotoxicity, including VOD/SOS
Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal hepatic VOD/SOS, was 
reported in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL receiving BESPONSA (see section 4.8).
BESPONSA significantly increased the risk of VOD/SOS above that of standard chemotherapy 
regimens in this patient population. This risk was most marked in patients who underwent subsequent 
HSCT.
In the following subgroups, the reported frequency of VOD/SOS post-HSCT was ≥ 50%:
-
-
-
Patients who received a HSCT conditioning regimen containing 2 alkylating agents;
Patients aged ≥ 65 years; and
Patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ ULN prior to HSCT.
The use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents should be avoided. The 
benefit/risk should be carefully considered before administering BESPONSA to patients in whom the 
future use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents is likely unavoidable.
In patients in whom the serum bilirubin is ≥ ULN prior to HSCT, HSCT post BESPONSA treatment 
should only be undertaken after careful consideration of the benefit/risk. If these patients do proceed to
HSCT, signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS should be monitored closely (see section 4.2).
Other patient factors that appear to be associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS after HSCT 
include a prior HSCT, age ≥ 55 years, a history of liver disease and/or hepatitis before treatment, later 
salvage lines, and a greater number of treatment cycles.
Careful consideration is required before administering BESPONSA to patients who have had a prior 
HSCT. No patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who were treated with BESPONSA in clinical 
studies had undergone HSCT within the previous 4 months.
Patients with a history of liver disease should be carefully evaluated (e.g., ultrasound scan, viral 
hepatitis testing) prior to treatment with BESPONSA to exclude serious ongoing hepatic disease (see 
section 4.3). 
Due to the risk of VOD/SOS, for patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of 
treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin is 2 cycles; a third cycle may be considered for those patients 
who do not achieve a CR or CRi and MRD negativity after 2 cycles (see section 4.2).
Signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS should be monitored closely in all patients, especially post HSCT. 
Signs may include elevations in total bilirubin, hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight 
gain, and ascites. Monitoring only total bilirubin may not identify all patients at risk of VOD/SOS. In 
all patients, liver tests should be monitored, including, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase, prior to and following each dose of BESPONSA. For patients who develop abnormal 
liver tests, liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity should be monitored more 
frequently. For patients who proceed to HSCT, liver tests should be monitored closely during the first 
month post-HSCT, then less frequently thereafter, according to standard medical practice. Elevation of 
6
liver tests may require dosing interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of 
BESPONSA (see section 4.2).
Treatment should be permanently discontinued if VOD/SOS occurs (see section 4.2). If severe 
VOD/SOS occurs, the patient should be treated according to standard medical practice.
Myelosuppression/cytopenias
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia, 
febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, and pancytopenia, some of which were life-threatening, have been 
reported (see section 4.8).
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, complications associated with neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia (including infections and bleeding/haemorrhagic events, respectively) were 
reported in some patients (see section 4.8). 
Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of BESPONSA and signs and 
symptoms of infection during treatment and after HSCT (see section 5.1), bleeding/haemorrhage, and 
other effects of myelosuppression should be monitored during treatment. As appropriate, prophylactic 
anti-infectives should be administered and surveillance testing should be employed during and after 
treatment. 
Management of severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage and other effects of myelosuppression, 
including severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, may require a dosing interruption, dose reduction, 
or discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.2).
Infusion related reactions
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, infusion related reactions were reported (see 
section 4.8). 
Pre-medication with a corticosteroid, antipyretic, and antihistamine is recommended prior to dosing 
(see section 4.2).
Patients should be monitored closely during and for at least 1 hour after the end of infusion for the 
potential onset of infusion related reactions, including symptoms such as hypotension, hot flush, or 
breathing problems. If an infusion related reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and 
appropriate medical management should be instituted. Depending on the severity of the infusion
related reaction, discontinuation of the infusion or administration of steroids and antihistamines should 
be considered (see section 4.2). For severe or life-threatening infusion reactions, treatment should be 
permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, TLS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, was 
reported (see section 4.8). 
Pre-medication to reduce uric acid levels and hydration is recommended prior to dosing for patients 
with a high tumour burden (see section 4.2). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of TLS and treated according to standard 
medical practice. 
QT interval prolongation
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, QT interval prolongation was observed (see sections 4.8 
and 5.2). 
7
BESPONSA should be administered with caution in patients who have a history of, or predisposition 
to QT interval prolongation, who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong QT interval
(see section 4.5) and in patients with electrolyte disturbances. ECG and electrolytes should be obtained 
prior to the start of treatment and periodically monitored during treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).
Increased amylase and lipase
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, increases in amylase and lipase have been reported (see 
section 4.8).
Patients should be monitored for increases in amylase and lipase. Potential hepatobiliary disease 
should be evaluated and treated according to standard medical practice. 
Immunisations 
The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following BESPONSA therapy has not 
been studied. Vaccination with live viral vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the 
start of BESPONSA treatment, during treatment, and until recovery of B lymphocytes following the 
last treatment cycle.
Excipients
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin,
that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
This medicinal product may be further prepared for administration with sodium-containing solutions 
(see sections 4.2 and 6.6) and this should be considered in relation to the total sodium from all sources 
that will be administered to the patient.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2).
Based on in vitro data, coadministration of inotuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) or uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) drug metabolising 
enzymes are unlikely to alter exposure to N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. In 
addition, inotuzumab ozogamicin and N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide are unlikely 
to alter the exposure of substrates of CYP enzymes, and N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin 
dimethylhydrazide is unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of UGT enzymes or major drug 
transporters.
In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin, prolonged QT interval was observed (see section 4.4). 
Therefore, the concomitant use of inotuzumab ozogamicin with medicinal products known to prolong 
QT interval or to induce Torsades de Pointes should be carefully considered. The QT interval should 
be monitored in case of combinations of such medicinal products (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BESPONSA.
8
Women should use effective contraception during treatment with BESPONSA and for at least 
8 months after the final dose. Men with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception during treatment with BESPONSA and for at least 5 months after the final dose. 
Pregnancy
There are no data in pregnant women using inotuzumab ozogamicin. Based on non-clinical safety 
findings, inotuzumab ozogamicin can cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
BESPONSA must not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs 
the potential risks to the foetus. Pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant while receiving 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, or treated male patients as partners of pregnant women, must be apprised of 
the potential hazard to the fetus.
Breast-feeding
There are no data on the presence of inotuzumab ozogamicin or its metabolites in human milk, the 
effects on the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for adverse 
reactions in breast-fed children, women must not breast-feed during treatment with BESPONSA and 
for at least 2 months after the final dose (see section 5.3).
Fertility
Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin (see section 5.3). There is no information on fertility in patients. Both men 
and women must seek advice for fertility preservation before treatment.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
BESPONSA has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients may experience 
fatigue during treatment with BESPONSA (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution is recommended when 
driving or operating machines.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatotoxicity, including VOD/SOS
In the pivotal clinical study (N=164), VOD/SOS was reported in 23 (14%) patients including 5 (3%) 
patients during study therapy or in follow-up without an intervening HSCT. Among the 79 patients 
who proceeded to a subsequent HSCT (8 of whom received additional salvage therapy after treatment 
with BESPONSA before proceeding to HSCT), VOD/SOS was reported in 18 (23%) patients. Five of 
the 18 VOD/SOS events that occurred post-HSCT were fatal (see section 5.1).
VOD/SOS was reported up to 56 days after the final dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin without an 
intervening HSCT. The median time from HSCT to onset of VOD/SOS was 15 days 
(range: 3-57 days). Of the 5 patients who experienced VOD/SOS during treatment with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin but without an intervening HSCT, 2 patients had also received an HSCT before 
BESPONSA treatment.
Among patients who proceeded to HSCT after BESPONSA treatment, VOD/SOS was reported in 
5/11 (46%) patients who received an HSCT both prior to and after BESPONSA treatment and 
13/68 (19%) patients who only received an HSCT after BESPONSA treatment.
Regarding other risk factors, VOD/ SOS was reported in 6/11 (55%) patients who received a HSCT 
conditioning regimen containing 2 alkylating agents and 9/53 (17%) patients who received a HSCT 
conditioning regimen containing 1 alkylating agent, 7/17 (41%) patients who were ≥ 55 years old and 
11/62 (18%) patients who were < 55 years old, and 7/12 (58%) patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ ULN 
prior to HSCT and in 11/67 (16%) patients with a serum bilirubin < ULN prior to HSCT.
In the pivotal study (N=164), hyperbilirubinaemia and increased transaminases were reported in 
35 (21%) and 43 (26%) patients, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 hyperbilirubinaemia and increased 
transaminases were reported in 9 (6%) and 11 (7%) patients, respectively. The median time to onset of 
hyperbilirubinaemia and increased transaminases was 73 days and 29 days, respectively. 
For clinical management of hepatotoxicity, including VOD/SOS, see section 4.4.
Myelosuppression/cytopenias
In the pivotal study (N=164), thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 83 (51%) and 
81 (49%) patients, respectively. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 23 (14%) 
and 33 (20%) patients, respectively. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 
46 (28%) and 45 (27%) patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, which may be life-threatening, was 
reported in 43 (26%) patients.
For clinical management of myelosuppression/cytopenias, see section 4.4.

Infections
In the pivotal study (N=164), infections, including serious infections, some of which were 
life-threatening or fatal, were reported in 79 (48%) patients. The frequencies of specific infections 
were: sepsis and bacteraemia (17%), lower respiratory tract infection (12%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (12%), fungal infection (9%), viral infection (7%), gastrointestinal infection (4%), skin 
infection (4%), and bacterial infection (1%). Fatal infections, including pneumonia, neutropenic 
sepsis, sepsis, septic shock, and pseudomonal sepsis, were reported in 8 (5%) patients. 
For clinical management of infections, see section 4.4.
Bleeding/haemorrhage
In the pivotal clinical study (N=164), bleeding/haemorrhagic events, mostly mild in severity, were 
reported in 54/ (33%) patients. The frequencies of specific bleeding/haemorrhagic events were: 
epistaxis (15%), upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (6%), lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (4%), 
and central nervous system (CNS) haemorrhage (1%). Grade 3/4 bleeding/haemorrhagic events were 
reported in 8/164 (5%) patients. One Grade 5 bleeding/haemorrhagic event (intra-abdominal 
haemorrhage) was reported.
For clinical management of bleeding/haemorrhagic events, see section 4.4.
Infusion related reactions
In the pivotal study (N=164), infusion related reactions were reported in 17 (10%) patients. All events 
were Grade ≤ 2 in severity. Infusion related reactions generally occurred in Cycle 1 and shortly after 
the end of the inotuzumab ozogamicin infusion and resolved spontaneously or with medical 
management.
For clinical management of infusion related reactions, see section 4.4.
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
In the pivotal study (N=164), TLS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, was reported in 4/164 (2%) 
patients. Grade 3/4 TLS was reported in 3 (2%) patients. TLS occurred shortly after the end of the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin infusion and resolved with medical management.
For clinical management of TLS, see section 4.4.
QT interval prolongation
In the pivotal study (N=164), maximum increases in QT interval corrected for heart rate using the 
Fridericia formula (QTcF) ≥ 30 msec and ≥ 60 msec from baseline were measured in 30/162 (19%) 
and 4/162 (3%) patient, respectively. An increase in QTcF interval of > 450 msec was observed in 
26/162 (16%) patients. No patients had an increase in QTcF interval > 500 msec. Grade 2 QT interval 
prolongation was reported in 2/164 (1%) patients. No Grade ≥ 3 QT interval prolongation or events of 
Torsades de Pointes were reported.
For periodic monitoring of ECG and electrolyte levels, see section 4.4.
Increased amylase and lipase
In the pivotal study (N=164), increases in amylase and lipase were reported in 8 (5%) and 15 (9%) 
patients, respectively. Increases in Grade ≥ 3 amylase and lipase were reported in 3 (2%) and 7 (4%) 
patients, respectively.
For periodic monitoring of increased amylase and lipase, see section 4.4.

Immunogenicity
In clinical studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, 
7/236 (3%) patients tested positive for anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies (ADA). No patients 
tested positive for neutralising ADA. In patients who tested positive for ADA, no effect on clearance 
of BESPONSA was detected based on population-pharmacokinetic analysis. The number of patients
with positive ADA was too small to assess the impact of ADA on efficacy and safety. 
In clinical study ITCC-059 of inotuzumab ozogamicin in paediatric patients with relapsed or 
refractory ALL (N=51), the incidence of ADA against inotuzumab ozogamicin was 0%.
Paediatric population
BESPONSA has been evaluated in 53 paediatric patients ≥ 1 and < 18 years of age with relapsed or 
refractory CD22-positive B cell precursor ALL in Study ITCC-059 (see section 5.1).
The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) in the paediatric study ITCC-059 were 
thrombocytopenia (60%), pyrexia (52%), anaemia (48%), vomiting (48%) neutropenia (44%), 
infection (44%), haemorrhage (40%), febrile neutropenia (32%), nausea (32%), abdominal pain (32%) 
in the Phase 1 Cohort and pyrexia (46%), thrombocytopenia (43%), anaemia (43%), vomiting (43%), 
neutropenia (36%), leukopenia (36%), nausea (32%), infection (32%), transaminase increased (32%), 
and haemorrhage (32%) in the Phase 2 Cohort.
In the Phase 1 Cohort, 2/25 (8.0%) patients had VOD (neither received transplant) and 6/28 (21.4%) 
patients in the Phase 2 Cohort had VOD, with a post-HSCT VOD rate of 5/18 (27.8% [95% CI: 
9.69-53.48]). In the Phase 1 Cohort, 8/25 patients (32%) and 18/28 (64%) in the Phase 2 Cohort had a 
follow-up HSCT. The post-HSCT non-relapse mortality rate was 2/8 (25%) and 5/18 (28%) in the 
Phase 1 Cohort and the Phase 2 Cohort, respectively. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
In clinical studies in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the maximum single and multiple doses 
of inotuzumab ozogamicin were 0.8 mg/m2 and 1.8 mg/m2, respectively, per cycle, given as 3 divided 
doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) (see section 4.2). Overdoses may
result in adverse reactions that are consistent with the reactions observed at the recommended 
therapeutic dose (see section 4.8). 
In the event of an overdose, the infusion should be temporarily interrupted, and patients should be 
monitored for liver and haematological toxicities (see section 4.2). Re-initiation of BESPONSA at the 
correct therapeutic dose should be considered when all toxicities have resolved.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, monoclonal antibodies
and antibody drug conjugates, CD22 (Clusters of Differentiation 22) inhibitors, ATC code: L01FB01.
Mechanism of action 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an ADC composed of a CD22-directed monoclonal antibody that is 
covalently linked to N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. Inotuzumab is a humanised 
immunoglobulin class G subtype 4 (IgG4) antibody that specifically recognises human CD22. The 
small molecule, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic product. 
N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin is covalently attached to the antibody via an acid-cleavable linker. 
Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of BESPONSA is due to the binding of the ADC 
to CD22-expressing tumour cells, followed by internalisation of the ADC-CD22 complex, and the 
intracellular release of N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of 
the linker. Activation of N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide induces double-stranded 
DNA breaks, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who have received 1 or 2 prior treatment regimens for 
ALL - Study 1
The safety and efficacy of BESPONSA in patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive ALL
were evaluated in an open-label, international, multicentre, Phase 3 study (Study 1) in which patients 
were randomised to receive BESPONSA (N=164 [164 received treatment) or Investigator’s choice of 
chemotherapy (N=162 [143 received treatment]), specifically fludarabine plus cytarabine plus 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) (N=102 [93 received treatment]), 
mitoxantrone/cytarabine (MXN/Ara-C) (N=38 [33 received treatment]), or high dose cytarabine 
(HIDAC) (N=22 [17 received treatment]).
Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) or Ph+ relapsed 
or refractory B-cell CD22-positive precursor ALL. 
CD22 expression was assessed using flow cytometry based on bone marrow aspirate. In patients with 
an inadequate bone marrow aspirate sample, a peripheral blood sample was tested. Alternatively, 
CD22 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry in patients with an inadequate bone 
marrow aspirate and insufficient circulating blasts. 
In the clinical study, the sensitivity of some local tests was lower than the central laboratory test. 
Therefore, only validated tests with demonstrated high sensitivity should be used.
All patients were required to have ≥ 5% bone marrow blasts and to have received 1 or 2 prior 
induction chemotherapy regimens for ALL. Patients with Ph+ B-cell precursor ALL were required to 
have failed treatment with at least 1 second or third generation TKI and standard chemotherapy. 
Table 1 (see section 4.2) shows the dosing regimen used to treat patients. 
The co-primary endpoints were CR/CRi, assessed by a blinded independent endpoint adjudication 
committee (EAC), and overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included MRD negativity,
duration of remission (DoR), HSCT rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). 
The primary analysis of CR/CRi and MRD negativity was conducted in the initial 218 randomised 
patients and the analysis of OS, PFS, DoR, and HSCT rate was conducted in all 326 randomised 
patients.
14
Among all 326 randomised patients (ITT population), 215 (66%) patients had received 1 prior 
treatment regimen and 108 (33%) patients had received 2 prior treatment regimens for ALL. The 
median age was 47 years (range: 18-79 years), 206 (63%) patients had a duration of first remission 
< 12 months, and 55 (17%) patients had undergone an HSCT prior to receiving BESPONSA or 
Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. The 2 treatment groups were generally balanced with respect 
to the baseline demographics and disease characteristics. A total of 276 (85%) patients had Ph- ALL.
Of the 49 (15%) patients with Ph+ ALL, 4 patients did not receive a prior TKI, 28 patients received 1 
prior TKI, and 17 patients received 2 prior TKIs. Dasatinib was the most commonly received TKI 
(42 patients) followed by imatinib (24 patients).
Baseline characteristics were similar in the initial 218 patients randomised.
Of the 326 patients (ITT population), 253 patients had samples that were evaluable for CD22 testing
by both local and central laboratory. By central and local laboratory tests, 231/253 (91.3%) patients 
and 130/253 (51.4%) patients, respectively, had ≥ 70% CD22-positive leukaemic blasts at baseline.
Table 6 shows the efficacy results from this study.

Table 6. 
Study 1: Efficacy results in patients ≥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell precursor ALL who received 1 or 2 prior treatment regimens for ALL
a CR, per EAC, was defined as < 5% blasts in the bone marrow and the absence of peripheral blood 
leukaemic blasts, full recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L and ANC ≥ 1 × 109/L) 
and resolution of any extramedullary disease.
b CRi, per EAC, was defined as < 5% blasts in the bone marrow and the absence of peripheral blood 
leukaemic blasts, partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets < 100 × 109/L and/or ANC 
< 1 × 109/L) and resolution of any extramedullary disease.
c MRD negativity was defined by flow cytometry as leukaemic cells comprising < 1 × 10-4 (< 0.01%) of bone 
marrow nucleated cells.
d Rate was defined as number of patients who achieved MRD negativity divided by the total number of 
patients who achieved CR/CRi per EAC.
e PFS was defined as the time from date of randomisation to earliest date of the following events: death, 
f
progressive disease (including objective progression, relapse from CR/CRi, treatment discontinuation due to 
global deterioration of health status), and start of new induction therapy or post-therapy HSCT without 
achieving CR/CRi.
In the standard definition of PFS, defined as the time from date of randomisation to earliest date of the 
following events: death, progressive disease (including objective progression and relapse from CR/CRi), the 
HR was 0.568 (2-sided p-value=0.0002) and median PFS was 5.6 months and 3.7 months in the 
BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm, respectively.
g Duration of remission was defined as the time since first response of CRa or CRib per Investigator’s 
assessment to the date of a PFS event or censoring date if no PFS event was documented. Analysis was 
based on the ITT population with patients without remission being given a duration of zero and considered 
an event.
Among the initial 218 randomised patients, 64/88 (73%) and 21/88 (24%) of responding patients per 
EAC achieved a CR/CRi in Cycles 1 and 2, respectively, in the BESPONSA arm. No additional 
patients achieved CR/CRi after Cycle 3 in the BESPONSA arm.
CR/CRi and MRD negativity findings in the initial 218 randomised patients were consistent with those 
seen in all 326 randomised patients.
Among all 326 randomised patients, the survival probability at 24 months was 22.8% in the 
BESPONSA arm and 10% in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm. 
A total of 79/164 (48.2%) patients in the BESPONSA arm and 36/162 (22.2%) patients in the 
Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm had a follow-up HSCT. This included 70 and 18 patients in 
the BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm, respectively, who proceeded directly 
to HSCT. In those patients who proceeded directly to HSCT, there was a median gap of 4.8 weeks 
(range: 1-19 weeks) between the final dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin and HSCT. The OS 
improvement for BESPONSA versus Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm was seen in patients 
who underwent HSCT. Although there was a higher frequency of early deaths post-HSCT (at Day 
100) in the BESPONSA arm, there was evidence of a late survival benefit for BESPONSA. In patients 
who underwent a follow-up HSCT, the median OS was 11.9 months (95% CI: 9.2, 20.6) for 
BESPONSA versus 19.8 months (95% CI: 14.6, 26.7) for Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. At 
month 24, the survival probability was 38.0% (95% CI: 27.4, 48.5) versus 35.5% (95% CI: 20.1, 51.3) 
for BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, respectively. Furthermore, at month 24,
the survival probability was 38.0% (95% CI: 27.4, 48.5) for patients who underwent a follow-up
HSCT compared to 8.0% (95% CI: 3.3, 15.3) for patients who did not undergo a follow-up HSCT in 
the BESPONSA arm.
BESPONSA improved OS versus Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy for all stratification factors 
including duration of first remission 12 months, Salvage 1 status, and age at randomisation 
< 55 years. There was also a trend for better OS with BESPONSA for patients with other prognostic 
factors (Ph-, no prior HSCT,  90% leukaemic blasts CD22-positive at baseline, no baseline peripheral 
blasts, and baseline haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, based on exploratory analyses). Patients with
mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene rearrangements, including t (4;11), that generally have lower 
16
CD22 expression prior to treatment, had a worse OS outcome following treatment with BESPONSA 
or Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. 
For patient-reported outcomes, most functioning and symptom scores were in favour of BESPONSA 
compared to Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. Patient-reported outcomes measured using the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire
(EORTC QLQ-C30), were significantly better for BESPONSA by estimated mean postbaseline scores 
(BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, respectively) for role functioning (64.7 
versus 53.4, improvement grade small), physical functioning (75.0 versus 68.1, improvement grade 
small), social functioning (68.1 versus 59.8, improvement grade medium), and appetite loss 
(17.6 versus 26.3, improvement grade small) compared to Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. 
There was a trend in favour of BESPONSA, improvement grade small, for estimated mean 
postbaseline scores (BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice, respectively) in global health 
status/Quality of Life (QoL) (62.1 versus 57.8), cognitive functioning (85.3 versus 82.5), dyspnoea 
(14.7 versus 19.4), diarrhoea (5.9 versus 8.9), fatigue (35.0 versus 39.4). There was a trend in favour 
of BESPONSA for estimated mean postbaseline scores from the EuroQoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) 
questionnaire, (BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, respectively) for the EQ-5D 
index (0.80 versus 0.76, minimally important difference for cancer = 0.06).
Patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who have received 2 or more prior treatment regimens for 
ALL - Study 2
The safety and efficacy of BESPONSA were evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, multicentre
Phase 1/2 study (Study 2). Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell 
precursor ALL.
Of 93 screened patients, 72 patients were assigned to study drug and treated with BESPONSA. The 
median age was 45 years (range: 20-79 years); 76.4% were Salvage status ≥ 2; 31.9% had received a 
prior HSCT and 22.2% were Ph+. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were: 
disease progression/relapse (30 [41.7%)], resistant disease (4 [5.6%]); HSCT (18 [25.0%]), and 
adverse events (13 [18.1%]).
In the Phase 1 portion of the study, 37 patients received BESPONSA at a total dose of 1.2 mg/m2
(N=3), 1.6 mg/m2 (N=12), or 1.8 mg/m2 (N=22). The recommended BESPONSA dose was determined 
to be 1.8 mg/m2/cycle administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 0.5 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 
of a 28-day cycle with a dose reduction upon achieving CR/CRi. 
In the Phase 2 portion of the study, patients had to have received at least 2 prior treatment regimens for 
ALL and patients with Ph+ B-cell ALL had to have failed treatment with at least 1 TKI. Of the 
9 patients with Ph+ B-cell ALL, 1 patient had received 1 previous TKI and 1 patient had received no 
prior TKIs.
Table 7 shows the efficacy results from this study.

Paediatric population
Study ITCC-059 has been performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Study ITCC-059 was a Phase 1/2 multicentre, single-arm, open-label study conducted in 53 paediatric 
patients ≥ 1 and < 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor ALL to 
identify a recommended Phase 2 Dose (Phase 1) and to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of the selected BESPONSA dose as a monotherapy agent (Phase 2). The study also 
evaluated the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of BESPONSA as monotherapy (see section 
5.2). 
In the Phase 1 Cohort (N=25), two dose levels were examined (initial dose of 1.4 mg/m2 per cycle and 
an initial dose of 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle). In the Phase 2 Cohort (N=28), patients were treated at the 
initial dose of 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle (0.8mg/m2 on Day 1, 0.5mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15) followed by a 
dose reduction to 1.5mg/m2 per cycle for patients in remission. In both Cohorts, patients received a 
median of 2 cycles of therapy (range: 1 to 4 cycles). In the Phase 1 Cohort, the median age was 
11 years (range: 1-16 years), and 52% of patients had second or greater relapsed B-cell precursor
ALL. In the Phase 2 Cohort, the median age was 7.5 years (range: 1-17 years), and 57% of patients 
had second or greater relapsed B-cell precursor ALL.
Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of Objective Response Rate (ORR), defined as the rate of patients 
with CR+CRp+CRi. In the Phase 1 Cohort, 20/25 (80%) patients had CR, the ORR was 80% (95% CI: 
59.3-93.2), and the median Duration of Response (DoR) was 8.0 months (95% CI: 3.9-13.9). In the 
Phase 2 Cohort, 18/28 (64%) patients had CR, the ORR was 79% (95% CI: 59.0-91.7), and the DoR 
was 7.6 months (95% CI: 3.3-NE). In the Phase 1 Cohort, 8/25 patients (32%) and 18/28 (64%) in the 
Phase 2 Cohort had a follow-up HSCT.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
In patients with relapsed or refractory ALL treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin at the recommended 
starting dose of 1.8 mg/m2/cycle (see section 4.2), steady-state exposure was achieved by Cycle 4. The 
mean (SD) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of inotuzumab ozogamicin was 308 ng/mL (362). 
The mean (SD) simulated total area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) per cycle at steady
state was 100 mcg●h/mL (32.9).
18
Distribution 
In vitro, the binding of the N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide to human plasma 
proteins is approximately 97%. In vitro, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is a 
substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In humans, the total volume of distribution of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin was approximately 12 L. 
Biotransformation
In vitro, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide was primarily metabolised via 
nonenzymatic reduction. In humans, serum N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide levels 
were typically below the limit of quantitation (50 pg/mL), but sporadic measurable levels of 
unconjugated calicheamicin up to 276 pg/mL occurred in some patients. 
Elimination 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin pharmacokinetics were well characterised by a 2-compartment model with 
linear and time-dependent clearance components. In 234 patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the 
clearance of inotuzumab ozogamicin at steady state was 0.0333 L/h, and the terminal elimination 
half-life (t½) at the end of Cycle 4 was approximately 12.3 days. Following administration of multiple 
doses, a 5.3 times accumulation of inotuzumab ozogamicin was observed between Cycles 1 and 4.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, body surface area was found to 
significantly affect inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition. The dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin is 
administered based on body surface area (see section 4.2).
Pharmacokinetics in specific groups of subjects or patients 
Age, race and gender
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, race and gender did not significantly affect 
inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition.
Hepatic impairment
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with 
hepatic impairment. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, the clearance of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in patients with hepatic impairment defined by National Cancer Institute Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group (NCI ODWG) category B1 (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN; 
N=133) or B2 (total bilirubin > 1.0-1.5 × ULN and AST any level; N=17) was similar to patients with 
normal hepatic function (total bilirubin/AST ≤ ULN; N=611) (see section 4.2). In 3 patients with 
hepatic impairment defined by NCI ODWG category C (total bilirubin > 1.5-3 × ULN and AST any 
level) and 1 patient with hepatic impairment defined by NCI ODWG category D (total 
bilirubin > 3 × ULN and AST any level), inotuzumab ozogamicin clearance did not appear to be 
reduced.
Renal impairment
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with 
renal impairment. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, the clearance of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min; N=237), moderate renal 
impairment (CLcr 30-59 mL/min; N=122), or severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min; N=4) was 
19
similar to patients with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min; N=402) (see section 4.2). 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (see section 4.2).
Paediatric population
At the adult recommended dose, the median exposure in paediatric patients with ALL (aged ≥1 and 
< 18 years) was 25% higher than those in adults. The clinical relevance of the increased exposure is 
unknown.
Cardiac electrophysiology
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation suggested a correlation between increasing 
inotuzumab ozogamicin serum concentrations and prolongation of QTc intervals in ALL and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) patients. The median (upper bound of the 95% CI) for the change in 
QTcF at a supratherapeutic Cmax concentration was 3.87 msec (7.54 msec).
In a randomised clinical study in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL (Study 1), maximum 
increases in QTcF interval of  30 msec and ≥ 60 msec from baseline were measured in 30/162 (19%) 
and 4/162 (3%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, respectively, versus18/124 (15%) and 
3/124 (2%) in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm, respectively. Increases in QTcF interval 
of > 450 msec and > 500 msec were observed in 26/162 (16%) and none of the patients in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus 12/124 (10%) and 1/124 (1%) patients in the Investigator’s choice 
of chemotherapy arm, respectively (see section 4.8). 
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity
In animals, the primary target organs included the liver, bone marrow and lymphoid organs with 
associated haematological changes, kidney, and nervous system. Other observed changes included 
male and female reproductive organ effects (see below) and preneoplastic and neoplastic liver lesions 
(see below). Most effects were reversible to partially reversible except for effects in the liver and 
nervous system. The relevance of the irreversible animal findings to humans is uncertain.
Genotoxicity
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was clastogenic in vivo in the bone marrow of male mice. This is consistent 
with the known induction of DNA breaks by calicheamicin. N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin 
dimethylhydrazide (the cytotoxic agent released from inotuzumab ozogamicin) was mutagenic in an 
in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay.
Carcinogenic potential
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin. In toxicity 
studies, rats developed oval cell hyperplasia, altered hepatocellular foci, and hepatocellular adenomas
in the liver at approximately 0.3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. In 1 monkey, a 
focus of hepatocellular alteration was detected at approximately 3.1 times the human clinical exposure 
based on AUC at the end of the 26-week dosing period. The relevance of these animal findings to 
humans is uncertain.
Reproductive toxicity
Administration of inotuzumab ozogamicin to female rats at the maternally toxic dose (approximately 
2.3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) prior to mating and during the first week of 
gestation resulted in embryo-foetal toxicity, including increased resorptions and decreased viable 
embryos. The maternally toxic dose (approximately 2.3 times the human clinical exposure based on
20
AUC) also resulted in foetal growth retardation, including decreased foetal weights and delayed 
skeletal ossification. Slight foetal growth retardation in rats also occurred at approximately 0.4 times 
the human clinical exposure based on AUC (see section 4.6).
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and 
fertility in men and women based on non-clinical findings (see section 4.6). In repeat dose toxicity 
studies in rats and monkeys, female reproductive findings included atrophy of ovaries, uterus, vagina, 
and mammary gland. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the effects on female 
reproductive organs in rats and monkeys was approximately 2.2 and 3.1 times the human clinical 
exposure based on AUC, respectively. In repeat dose toxicity studies in rats, male reproductive 
findings included testicular degeneration, associated with hypospermia, and prostatic and seminal 
vesicle atrophy. The NOAEL was not identified for the effects on male reproductive organs, which 
were observed at approximately 0.3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC.

Instructions for reconstitution, dilution, and administration
Use appropriate aseptic technique for the reconstitution and dilution procedures. Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (which has a density of 1.02 g/mL at 20°C) is light sensitive and should be protected from 
ultraviolet light during reconstitution, dilution, and administration.
The maximum time from reconstitution through the end of administration should be ≤ 8 hours, with 
≤ 4 hours between reconstitution and dilution. 
Reconstitution
 Calculate the dose (mg) and number of vials of BESPONSA required. 
 Reconstitute each 1 mg vial with 4 mL of water for injection, to obtain a single-use solution of 
0.25 mg/mL of BESPONSA. 
 Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake. 

Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulates and discolouration. The reconstituted 
solution must be clear to slightly cloudy, colourless, and essentially free of visible foreign 
matter. If particles or discolouration are observed, do not use.
 BESPONSA contains no bacteriostatic preservatives. The reconstituted solution must be used 
immediately. If the reconstituted solution cannot be used immediately, it may be stored in a 
refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C) for up to 4 hours. Protect from light and do not freeze. 
Dilution
 Calculate the required volume of the reconstituted solution needed to obtain the appropriate 
dose according to patient body surface area. Withdraw this amount from the vial(s) using a 
syringe. Protect from light. Discard any unused reconstituted solution left in the vial.
 Add the reconstituted solution to an infusion container with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection, to a total nominal volume of 50 mL. The final concentration should be 
between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL. Protect from light. An infusion container made of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) (di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate [DEHP]- or non-DEHP-containing), polyolefin 
(polypropylene and/or polyethylene), or ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is recommended. 
 Gently invert the infusion container to mix the diluted solution. Do not shake.
 The diluted solution must be used immediately, stored at room temperature (20 °C-25 °C), or
in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C). The maximum time from reconstitution through the end of 
administration should be ≤ 8 hours, with ≤ 4 hours between reconstitution and dilution. Protect 
from light and do not freeze. 
Administration


If the diluted solution is stored in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C), it must be allowed to equilibrate 
at room temperature (20 °C-25 °C) for approximately 1 hour prior to administration.
Filtration of the diluted solution is not required. However, if the diluted solution is filtered, 
polyethersulphone (PES)-, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-, or hydrophilic polysulphone 
(HPS)-based filters are recommended. Do not use filters made of nylon or mixed cellulose
ester (MCE).

6. Contents of the pack and other information
1. What BESPONSA is and what it is used for
The active substance in BESPONSA is inotuzumab ozogamicin. This belongs to a group of medicines 
that target cancer cells. These medicines are called antineoplastic agents.
BESPONSA is used to treat adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia is a cancer of blood where you have too many white blood cells. BESPONSA is intended 
for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for adult patients who have previously tried other 
treatments and for whom those treatments have failed.
BESPONSA acts by attaching to cells with a protein called CD22. Lymphoblastic leukaemia cells 
have this protein. Once attached to the lymphoblastic leukaemia cells, the medicine delivers a 
substance into the cells that interferes with the cells’ DNA and eventually kills them.
2. What you need to know before you are given BESPONSA
Do not use BESPONSA if you



are allergic to inotuzumab ozogamicin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
have previously had severe venoocclusive disease (a condition in which the blood vessels in the 
liver become damaged and blocked by blood clots) which was confirmed or have ongoing 
venoocclusive disease.
have serious ongoing liver disease, e.g., cirrhosis (a condition in which the liver does not 
function properly due to long-term damage), nodular regenerative hyperplasia (a condition with 
signs and symptoms of portal hypertension that can be caused by chronic use of medicines), 
active hepatitis (a disease characterised by inflammation of the liver).
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given BESPONSA if you:
33






have a history of liver problems or liver diseases or if you have signs and symptoms of a serious 
condition called hepatic venoocclusive disease, a condition in which the blood vessels in the 
liver become damaged and blocked by blood clots. Venoocclusive disease may be fatal and is 
associated with rapid weight gain, pain in the upper right side of your abdomen (belly), increase 
in the size of the liver, build-up of fluid causing abdominal swelling, and blood tests showing 
increases in bilirubin and/or liver enzymes (that may result in yellowing of the skin or eyes). 
This condition may occur during treatment with BESPONSA or after subsequent treatment with 
a stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to transplant another person’s stem 
cells (cells which develop into new blood cells) into your bloodstream. This procedure may take 
place if your disease responds completely to treatment.
have signs or symptoms of a low number of blood cells known as neutrophils (sometimes 
accompanied with fever), red blood cells, white blood cells, lymphocytes, or a low number of 
blood components known as platelets; these signs and symptoms include developing an 
infection or fever or bruising easily or getting frequent nose bleeds.
have signs and symptoms of an infusion related reaction, such as fever and chills or breathing 
problems during or shortly after the BESPONSA infusion.
have signs and symptoms of tumour lysis syndrome, which may be associated with symptoms in 
the stomach and intestines (for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), heart (for example, 
changes in the rhythm), kidney (for example, decreased urine, blood in urine), and nerves and 
muscles (for example, muscular spasms, weakness, cramps), during or shortly after the 
BESPONSA infusion. 
have a history of, or tendency to have, QT interval prolongation (a change in electrical activity 
of the heart that can cause serious irregular heart rhythms), are taking medicines that are known 
to prolong QT interval, and/or have abnormal electrolyte (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium)
levels.
have elevations in amylase or lipase enzymes that may be a sign of problems with your pancreas 
or liver and gallbladder or bile ducts.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you became pregnant during the period of 
treatment with BESPONSA and for up to 8 months after finishing treatment. 
Your doctor will take regular blood tests to monitor your blood counts during treatment with 
BESPONSA. See also section 4.
During treatment, especially in the first few days after starting treatment, your white blood cell count
may be severely lowered (neutropenia), which may be accompanied by fever (febrile neutropenia). 
During treatment, especially in the first few days after starting treatment, you may have raised liver 
enzymes. Your doctor will take regular blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes during treatment 
with BESPONSA. 
Treatment with BESPONSA may prolong QT interval (a change in electrical activity of the heart that 
can cause serious irregular heart rhythms). Your doctor will take an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
blood tests to measure electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) before the first dose of 
BESPONSA and repeat these tests during treatment. See also section 4.
Your doctor will also monitor for signs and symptoms of tumour lysis syndrome after you receive 
BESPONSA. See also section 4.
Children and adolescents
BESPONSA should not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because limited
data are available in this population.
34
Other medicines and BESPONSA
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this medicine.
Contraception 
You must avoid becoming pregnant or fathering a child. Women must use effective contraception 
during treatment and for at least 8 months after the final dose of treatment. Men must use effective 
contraception during treatment and for at least 5 months after the final dose of treatment.
Pregnancy
The effects of BESPONSA in pregnant women are not known, but based on its mechanism of action
BESPONSA may harm your unborn baby. You should not use BESPONSA during pregnancy, unless 
your doctor thinks that it is the best medicine for you. 
Contact your doctor immediately if you or your partner becomes pregnant during the period of 
treatment with this medicine.
Fertility
Men and women should seek advice regarding fertility preservation before treatment.
Breast-feeding
If you need treatment with BESPONSA, you must stop breast-feeding during treatment and for at least 
2 months after treatment. Talk to your doctor.
Driving and using machines
If you feel unusually tired (this is a very common side effect of BESPONSA), you should not drive or 
use machines.
BESPONSA contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin, that is to 
say essentially ‘sodium-free.’
3. How BESPONSA is given
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.
How BESPONSA is given



Your doctor will decide on the correct dose. 
A doctor or nurse will give you BESPONSA through a drip in your vein (intravenous infusion) 
which will run for 1 hour.
Each dose is given weekly and each treatment cycle is 3 doses.
35






If the medicine works well and you are going to receive a stem cell transplant (see section 2), 
you may receive 2 cycles or a maximum of 3 cycles of treatment.
If the medicine works well, but you are not going to receive a stem cell transplant (see section 
2), you may receive up to a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment. 
If you do not respond to the medicine within 3 cycles, your treatment will be stopped.
Your doctor may change your dose, interrupt, or completely stop treatment with BESPONSA if 
you have certain side effects.
Your doctor may lower your dose based on your response to treatment.
Your doctor will do blood tests during the treatment to check for side effects and for response to 
treatment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.
Medicines given before treatment with BESPONSA
Before your treatment with BESPONSA, you will be given other medicines (pre-medications) to help 
reduce infusion reactions and other possible side effects. These may include corticosteroids (e.g.,
dexamethasone), antipyretics (medicines to reduce fever), and antihistamines (medicines to reduce 
allergic reactions).
Before your treatment with BESPONSA, you may be given medicines and be hydrated to prevent 
tumour lysis syndrome from occurring. Tumour lysis syndrome is associated with a variety of 
symptoms in the stomach and intestines (for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), heart (for 
example, changes in the rhythm), kidney (for example, decreased urine, blood in urine), and nerves 
and muscles (for example, muscular spasms, weakness, cramps).

http://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. 
This leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website. 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only. For full information on 
dosage and dose modifications please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.
Method of administration
BESPONSA is for intravenous use. The infusion must be administered over 1 hour.
Do not administer BESPONSA as an intravenous push or bolus. 
BESPONSA must be reconstituted and diluted before administration.
BESPONSA should be administered in 3- to 4-week cycles. 
For patients proceeding to a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the recommended duration 
of treatment is 2 cycles. A third cycle may be considered for those patients who do not achieve a
CR/CRi and MRD negativity after 2 cycles. For patients not proceeding to HSCT, a maximum of 
6 cycles, may be administered. Any patients who do not achieve a CR/CRi within 3 cycles should 
discontinue treatment (see Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.2).
The table below shows the recommended dosing regimens.
For the first cycle, the recommended total dose for all patients is 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle, administered as 
3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2). Cycle 1 is 3 weeks in 
duration, but may be extended to 4 weeks if the patient achieves a CR or CRi, and/or to allow recovery 
from toxicity.
For subsequent cycles, the recommended total dose is 1.5 mg/m2 per cycle administered as 3 divided
doses on Days 1 (0.5 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who achieve a CR/CRi or 
1.8 mg/m2 per cycle given as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 
15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who do not achieve a CR/CRi. Subsequent cycles are 4 weeks in duration.

a +/- 2 days (maintain a minimum of 6 days between doses).
b For patients who achieve a CR/CRi, and/or to allow for recovery from toxicity, the cycle length may be 
extended up to 28 days (i.e. 7-day treatment-free interval starting on Day 21).
c CR is defined as < 5% blasts in the bone marrow and the absence of peripheral blood leukaemic blasts, full 
recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L and ANC ≥ 1 × 109/L) and resolution of any 
extramedullary disease. 
d CRi is defined as < 5% blasts in the bone marrow and the absence of peripheral blood leukaemic blasts, 
incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets < 100 × 109/L and/or ANC < 1 × 109/L) and 
resolution of any extramedullary disease.
e 7-day treatment-free interval starting on Day 21.
Instructions for reconstitution, dilution, and administration
Use appropriate aseptic technique for the reconstitution and dilution procedures. Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (which has a density of 1.02 g/mL at 20 °C) is light sensitive and should be protected from 
ultraviolet light during reconstitution, dilution, and administration.
The maximum time from reconstitution through the end of administration should be ≤ 8 hours, with ≤
4 hours between reconstitution and dilution. 
Reconstitution: 
 Calculate the dose (mg) and number of vials of BESPONSA required. 
 Reconstitute each 1 mg vial with 4 mL of water for injection, to obtain a single-use solution of 
0.25 mg/mL of BESPONSA. 
 Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake. 

Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulates and discolouration. The reconstituted 
solution must be clear to slightly cloudy, colourless, and essentially free of visible foreign 
matter. If particles or discolouration are observed, do not use.
 BESPONSA contains no bacteriostatic preservatives. The reconstituted solution must be used 
immediately. If the reconstituted solution cannot be used immediately, it may be stored in a 
refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C) for up to 4 hours. Protect from light and do not freeze. 
Dilution: 
 Calculate the required volume of the reconstituted solution needed to obtain the appropriate 
dose according to patient body surface area. Withdraw this amount from the vial(s) using a 
syringe. Protect from light. Discard any unused reconstituted solution left in the vial.
 Add the reconstituted solution to an infusion container with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection, to a total nominal volume of 50 mL. The final concentration should be 
between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL. Protect from light. An infusion container made of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) (di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate [DEHP]- or non-DEHP-containing), polyolefin 
(polypropylene and/or polyethylene), or ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is recommended.

 Gently invert the infusion container to mix the diluted solution. Do not shake.
 The diluted solution must be used immediately, stored at room temperature (20 °C-25 °C) or
in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C). The maximum time from reconstitution through the end of 
administration should be ≤ 8 hours, with ≤ 4 hours between reconstitution and dilution. Protect
from light and do not freeze. 
Administration:




If the diluted solution is stored in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C), it must be allowed to equilibrate 
at room temperature (20 °C-25 °C) for approximately 1 hour prior to administration.
Filtration of the diluted solution is not required. However, if the diluted solution is filtered, 
polyethersulphone (PES)-, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-, or hydrophilic polysulphone 
(HPS)-based filters are recommended. Do not use filters made of nylon or mixed cellulose 
ester (MCE).
Protect the intravenous bag from light using an ultraviolet light-blocking cover (i.e., amber, 
dark brown, or green bags or aluminium foil) during infusion. The infusion line does not need 
to be protected from light.
Infuse the diluted solution for 1 hour at a rate of 50 mL/h at room temperature (20 °C-25 °C). 
Protect from light. Infusion lines made of PVC (DEHP or non-DEHP-containing), polyolefin 
(polypropylene and/or polyethylene), or polybutadiene are recommended.
Do not mix BESPONSA or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products.

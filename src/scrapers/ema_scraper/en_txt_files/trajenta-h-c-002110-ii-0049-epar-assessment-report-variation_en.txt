population based on final results from study DINAMO 1218-0091; this is a Phase III double-blind, 
randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 
and linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 52 
weeks, in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0446/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0446/2021 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0446/2021.  
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The company evaluated clinical data on the use of linagliptin in children and adolescents with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis 
In support of the variation, linagliptin PK was assessed in the paediatric population in the two studies 
(1218-0056 and 1218-0091 (DINAMO)). Linagliptin PK was assessed using descriptive analysis per 
study, and also by the use of a sufficiently validated population PK (popPK) model.  
In summary, the PK analyses suggested no difference in the PK between children/adolescents and 
adults concerning body weight, sex, race, renal function and antidiabetic background therapy at 
baseline and support the comparability of the linagliptin PK between paediatric and adult T2DM 
patients. 
Exposure-effect 
The relationship between linagliptin exposure and HbA1c was investigated using a sufficiently validated 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model, which was modified from a previously developed 
model to which the new paediatric data were added.  
A smaller effect of linagliptin treatment was observed in children compared to adults.

Phase 3 trial 
Trial 1218.91 (DINAMOTM) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group 
trial with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in 
children from 10 to ≤17 years of age. 
Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., non responders) were re-
randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg 
empagliflozin. The trial also included a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 52 
weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or 
empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg).  
In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled 
(52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. 
In the 26-week Phase III trial 1218.91 in adolescents, treatment with 5 mg linagliptin was not 
associated with a relevant reduction in HbA1c. 
The rates of any adverse events (AEs) in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally 
comparable, as were the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and 
serious adverse events (SAEs). With the exception of hypoglycaemia, the rates of adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs) and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-controlled period were 
comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups. No unexpected safety concerns were identified 
for linagliptin in the paediatric programme. 
Benefit-risk balance 
No unexpected safety concerns were identified for linagliptin in the paediatric programme. However, 
treatment with 5 mg linagliptin was not associated with a relevant benefit. The benefit-risk balance of 
Trajenta in adolescents is negative.  
The benefit-risk balance of Trajenta in adults remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
Linagliptin is a potent inhibitor of DPP-4 activity and prolongs the half-life of GLP-1. It is an orally 
available compound with a low risk for hypoglycaemic episodes. Linagliptin for the treatment of T2DM 
in adults is approved in over 90 countries, including the European Union, the USA, and Japan. 
The company evaluated clinical data on the use of linagliptin in children and adolescents with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were treated with metformin and/or insulin or who were not tolerating 
metformin. This clinical overview summarises the results from trials 1218.91 and 1218.56. 
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
The clinical development program for linagliptin in children and adolescents 10-17 years of age with 
T2DM consisted of two clinical trials.  
The Phase I study 1218-0056 [c02827550-01] was a double-blind, placebo–controlled, 12-week, 
parallel-group trial to evaluate the PK and PD of linagliptin after single and multiple doses of 1 and 5 
mg linagliptin. Sparse and rich PK/PD (Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), DPP–4 inhibition, and Fasting 
Plasma Glucose (FPG)) sampling up to 24 hours post-drug administration was performed in 39 
patients. Based on the results of this study, the dose of 5 mg linagliptin for the subsequent Phase III 
DINAMO study (1218-0091, [c38245139]) was selected. 
The Phase III DINAMO study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of 5 mg linagliptin over 26 weeks, with a double-blind, active treatment safety 
extension period up to 52 weeks in children and adolescents 10-17 years of age with T2DM. As a 
measure of systemic exposure to linagliptin, steady state trough and 1.5 h post-dose PK samples were 
taken. The DINAMO study also included the administration of the selective sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin in separate treatment arms. 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Analysis of linagliptin 
Specific and sensitive HPLC-MS/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry) methods were developed and validated to support the clinical linagliptin development 
program. 
Sufficiently validated methods [n00194391, n00240725] were used for studies 1218-0056 and 1218-
0091. While method n00194391 had been validated for the determination of linagliptin and its 
metabolite CD 1750 XX, it was used for the analysis of linagliptin alone in Phase I trial 1218-0056. 
Method n00240725 had been validated for the determination of linagliptin alone using unchanged 
extraction procedure and LC-MS/MS conditions and was employed for Phase III trial 1218-0091. 
Overall (inter-) assay performance data for linagliptin are shown in Table 1.

The accuracy and precision of all validated bioanalytical assays used during the paediatric clinical 
development of linagliptin were within the acceptance criteria of ≤ 20% for the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) and ≤ 15% for all other concentrations, in line with The FDA Guidance for 
industry: bioanalytical method validation and the EMA guideline on bioanalytical method validation.  
Linagliptin proved to be stable in human plasma for at least 24 h at room temperature, 4 freeze/thaw 
cycles and 416 days freezer storage at -20°C. 
The incurred samples reanalysis (ISR) pass rate was 97.1% for Study 1218-0056 and 94.8% for Study 
1218-0091 and, therefore, demonstrates good assay reproducibility.  
Population PK analysis 
Data manipulation, visualization, and simulations were conducted using version 4.1 of R. Population PK 
and ER analyses for repeated-measures endpoints were conducted via nonlinear mixed effects 
modelling with a qualified installation of the NONMEM® software, Version 7.5 (ICON PLC, Ireland). All 
code was maintained using the version control system Subversion. All analyses were conducted on a 
computer grid with multiple compute nodes. Each node runs the Linux operating system that utilized 
the gfortran® Fortran Compiler (version 7.5.0 for Linux). 
Data from Phase III Study 1218-0091 was used to develop the popPK model (c39218172), starting 
from a popPK model (c37380493) that was previously developed with data from several studies in 
adults and from the multiple-dose Phase IIb study 1218-0056 in children and adolescents with T2DM 
from 10 to 17 years of age. This structural model c37380493 was re-estimated using the data from 
study 1218-0091 under a Bayesian framework in study c39218172. 
The parameter estimates from the previous linagliptin population PK model were used as priors to 
inform the model parameters without direct support from the sparse paediatric data. For parameters of 
primary interest, namely apparent clearance after oral dosing (CL/F), apparent central volume of 
distribution after oral dosing (V2/F), and CL/F by sex, weakly informative priors were used. All 
parameter estimates were reported as point estimates from NONMEM® with 95% credible intervals 
derived from the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates. Additional effects for covariates 
were explored graphically and estimated as necessary to explain potential biases in the 
characterization of PK observed in the paediatric population.

A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and a saturable binding sub-model in the central 
compartment was used based on the results of previous analyses. The model was parameterized with 
CL/F, V2/F, apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), the apparent peripheral volume of 
distribution after oral dosing (V3/F), absorption rate constant (ka), and parameters relating to saturable 
binding (binding affinity (KSS) and total DPP-4 concentration (RMAX)). Weight (WT) was used to scale 
clearances and volumes according to fixed allometric exponents between adult and paediatric study 
patients. The final PopPK model parameters are shown in Table 2. The structure of the two-
compartment model with first-order absorption and a saturable binding submodel in the central 
compartment, as described before, was retained in the final model, and no additional covariates were 
included.  
The previous model estimated interindividual variability (IIV) on CL/F and ka. IIV could not be 
estimated on ka in the current model due to the limited number of PK observations available in the 
absorption phase. Interoccasion variability was estimated in the previous model but not estimated in 
the current model, given the limited number of observations per sampling occasion. Therefore, using 
an exponential variance model, the final model only included IIV on CL/F. The residual error model was 
also adjusted to include two separate error terms, with one for outlier PK trough observations, which 
was defined as concentrations more than 5-fold smaller than the median concentration 24 hours post-
dose at steady state, and one for all remaining observations. The residual error was described with an 
additive error model in the logarithmic scale, which corresponds to using proportional error in the 
linear scale.

The final model provided a reasonable description of the data, as judged by visual inspection of model 
diagnostic plots. No systemic bias was noted in expected weighted residual (EWRES) or NPDE versus 
time and population predicted concentration or time after dose. There were also no obvious trends in 
plots of IIV random effects versus continuous or categorical covariates. Visual predictive checks (VPCs)

indicated that the current model reasonably fit steady-state concentrations in paediatric patients 
across covariates of interest in Study 1218.56 and 1218-0091 (DINAMO). 
Exposure response analysis 
In a previous analysis, a population ER model was developed for longitudinal HbA1c using data from 
several studies in adults and from the multiple-dose Phase IIb study 1218-0056 in children and 
adolescents with T2DM from 10 to 17 years of age. This ER model was re-estimated for the new 
paediatric data from study 1218-0091 using full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian 
estimation methods, with prior distributions defined from the point estimates and uncertainty of the 
adult ER model for model parameters without direct support from the paediatric data. Specifically, the 
AUCss producing half maximal inhibitory effect (AUC50) was estimated with an informative prior, while 
all other parameters were estimated with weakly informative priors. Additional effects for covariates 
were explored graphically and estimated as necessary to explain potential biases in the 
characterization of change in HbA1c observed in the paediatric population. 
The previous model was used as a starting point and consisted of a simple HbA1c turnover process with 
an effect of a wash-out as an additive zero-order process. Linagliptin was allowed to inhibit the 
production of HbA1c through an inhibitory maximum effect (Emax) model. Linagliptin AUCss was 
simulated for all PK patients to drive the ER model using their individual parameter estimates. 
Specifically, AUCss were derived by integrating over the individual concentration-time profile for an 
interval of 24 hours, under steady-state conditions, and their assigned linagliptin dose. Metformin and 
insulin were modelled as simple time-invariant effects that proportionally adjusted the zero-order 
production of HbA1c and baseline HbA1c. Given Study 1218-0091 includes a 2-week run-in period with 
an open-label placebo, the effect of washout was not estimated in the current analysis (i.e., no wash-
out effect in current data). 
The final ER model parameters are shown in Table 3. Model performances were evaluated by using 
predictive checks and Bayesian diagnostics with prior insulin co-therapy than those without.  
The final model provided a reasonable description of the data, as judged by visual inspection of model 
diagnostic plots. VPCs demonstrated that the model provided an adequate description of HbA1c over 
time across all dose levels, treatment arms, and covariates of interest in Study 1218.56 and 1218-
2019 (DINAMO). 
Parameter estimates were compared between the previous and current models with paediatric data 
from Study 1218.91. Using the previous and current models, Monte Carlo simulations were performed 
to compare population-level placebo-adjusted HbA1c change from baseline at 26 weeks in adults and 
paediatric patients.

6.2.  Results 
Descriptive and population PK (popPK) analysis 
The PK results in children and adolescents from Phase III study 1218-0091 and Phase I study 1218-
0056 were compared to the data previously obtained in adult T2DM patients by (i) descriptive analysis 
and (ii) based on a population PK (popPK) model, which included data from both studies in paediatric 
T2DM patients as well as several studies in adult T2DM patients [c39218172].  
In Study 1218-0056, steady-state linagliptin trough levels in the linagliptin 5 mg group were higher 
than in the linagliptin 1 mg group, with gMean trough levels of 7.42 nmol/L (gCV 98.5%) and 3.80 
nmol/L (gCV 69.9 %), respectively (see Figure 1). Linagliptin plasma levels increased less than dose 
proportional. For the 4 patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group for whom rich PK sampling data were 
available for non-compartmental PK analysis, AUCτ,ss values were between 152 nmol·h/L and 306 
nmol·h/L. The accumulation-based half-lives ranged from 8.15 h to 29.4 h. For the 2 patients in the 
linagliptin 1 mg group with rich PK sampling the AUCτ,ss values were 142 nmol·h/L and 148 nmol·h/L. 
The accumulation-based half-lives were 29.1 h and 108 h, respectively.

Figure 1. Individual and gMean trough concentrations of linagliptin at steady state after once daily oral 
administration of 1 mg or 5 mg linagliptin (Study 1218-0056) 
In Phase III Study 1218-0091, in total, there were 164 valid plasma samples available for the PK 
analysis of linagliptin. Variability of linagliptin plasma concentrations was considerably higher for 
samples taken pre-dose (week 26: gCV 124%; week 52: gCV 213%) than for samples taken post-dose 
(week 26: gCV 42.3%; and week 52: gCV 53.2%); hence, post-dose levels may better reflect potential 
inter-patient variability. Plasma concentrations at Week 52 were used for all descriptive subgroup 
analyses.  
Influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on linagliptin exposure. 
The effect of demographic and baseline characteristics, including renal function (eGFR calculated by 
the Zappitelli-formula), age, body weight, BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical region, and country 
on linagliptin exposure was investigated descriptively in Study 1218-0091. 
In addition, the impact of the most relevant co-medications, such as metformin and insulin, on 
linagliptin plasma concentrations was evaluated. Furthermore, the relationship between drug plasma 
concentrations and the occurrence of certain AEs was analysed descriptively. 
Despite slight differences in gMean plasma concentrations, individual exposure values were largely 
overlapping between subgroups, suggesting no influence of renal function, age, sex, race, and region 
on linagliptin exposure within the investigated range. Exposure slightly increased with a body weight 
below 70 kg (see Figure 2). There was no influence of baseline medication on linagliptin exposure. 
Linagliptin exposure did not seem to have an influence on the occurrence of hypoglycaemia (see Figure 
3).

Plasma concentrations of linagliptin in children and adolescents with T2DM were generally comparable 
to those previously observed in adult patients with T2DM.  
Population PK model c39218172 
The popPK model c39218172 for paediatric patients with T2DM included the following covariates with 
an influence on the PK: linagliptin exposure was characterized as increasing with decreasing weight 
following allometric scaling; The parameter estimate for sex effect on CL/F suggested that linagliptin 
CL/F appeared to be higher in females, but the 95% CDIs included the null value (146 (94.4, 226)%) 
(Table 2).  
Individual CL/F estimates for paediatric patients in the current model were consistent with individual 
CL/F estimates for paediatric patients in the previous model (Figure 4). Both groups of paediatric 
patients had lower individual CL/F estimates relative to adult patients in the previous model. 
Consistent with lower CL/F estimates for paediatric patients, Monte Carlo simulations indicated 
paediatric patients had slightly higher AUCss values (19.9% higher) relative to adults. However, there 
was substantial overlap in the distribution of AUCss between adult and paediatric patients, indicating 
that generally similar exposure can be achieved in the two patient populations given a linagliptin 5 mg 
dose (Figure 5).  
The results of the popPK analysis were in line with the results from the descriptive analysis.

Descriptive comparison of exposure by subgroups of covariates suggested no difference of the PK 
between children/adolescents and adults with respect to body weight, sex, and antidiabetic 
background therapy at baseline. 
In summary, these analyses support the comparability of the PK between paediatric and adult T2DM 
patients. 
Exposure-response (ER) analysis 
The final, re-estimated ER model was a disease progression model, and linagliptin effect was assumed 
to inhibit kin via an Emax model. The model was parameterized with a zero-order HbA1c synthesis rate 
(kin), and a constant HbA1c first-order degradation rate (HbA1c degradation rate constant (kout)). 
Paediatric patients requiring insulin showed higher HbA1c baseline as well as a more pronounced 
disease progression. This resulted in a larger simulated magnitude of placebo-adjusted change of 
HbA1c in patients requiring insulin. To account for the apparent disease progression observed in the 
paediatric data, the model was updated by including a time-dependent change in the synthesis 
process. Specifically, the synthesis rate (kin) changed over time by a zero-order process. Linagliptin 
effect was parameterized to inhibit kin via an Emax model. Insulin was included as a covariate, and 
insulin co-therapy at baseline was associated with a higher baseline HbA1c and a faster disease 
progression. Inter-individual variability (IIV) was included on baseline HbA1c and the disease 
progression parameter. A proportional residual error was also included. 
In the comparison of paediatric and adult patients, paediatric patients had slightly lower maximum 
inhibition (Imax) compared to adults. In Monte Carlo simulations, the simulated placebo-adjusted 
change from baseline HbA1c in adults was larger than that of paediatric patients both without prior 
insulin use (median adult: -0.614%; paediatric: -0.409%), and with prior insulin use (median adult: -
0.647%; paediatric: -0.527%), thus indicating a smaller drug effect for paediatric compared to adult 
patients. Variability in response was higher in paediatric patients.  
At week 26 (timepoint of primary efficacy endpoint in 1218-0091), the difference in response between 
patients with and without prior insulin use was much larger in paediatric subjects compared to adults 
(median difference placebo corrected change from baseline adult: 0.033%; paediatric: 0.118%). 
6.3.  Discussion 
In support of the variation, linagliptin PK was assessed in the two studies (1218-0056 and 1218-0091 
(DINAMO)). The methods used for the quantification of linagliptin in plasma have been sufficiently 
validated. Method n00194391, used for analysis of samples from Phase I study 1218-0056, was also 
used in studies provided with the initial MAA for linagliptin. The robustness of the analysis was shown 
by the ISR results. In response to an initial OC, it was indicated that the stability period covers the 
maximum storage period of the samples.  
Linagliptin PK was assessed using descriptive analysis per study, and also by the use of a popPK 
model. The popPK model was developed based on a prior model containing PK data in adults and 
appears sufficiently validated. 
Based on information from Phase II Study 1218-0056, total linagliptin exposure increased less than 
dose-proportional between the 1 and 5 mg dose. This has also been observed for adults, and is 
thought to be due to the concentration dependent binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. As discussed and 
accepted in a previous Type II variation EMEA/H/C/WS1162, linagliptin 5 mg in the paediatric 
population showed superiority over 1 mg about trough DPP-4 inhibition and a numerically larger 
reduction concerning the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c.This provided support for the 
use of the 5 mg dose in the subsequent Phase III Study 1218-0091.

The effect of demographic and baseline characteristics, including renal function, age, body weight, 
BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical region, and country, on linagliptin exposure was investigated 
descriptively in Study 1218-0091. Despite slight differences in mean plasma concentrations, individual 
exposure values were largely overlapping between subgroups, suggesting no influence of renal 
function, age, sex, race, and region on linagliptin exposure within the investigated range. Exposure 
slightly increased with a body weight below 70 kg. There was no influence of baseline medication on 
linagliptin exposure, and linagliptin exposure did not seem to have an influence on the occurrence of 
hypoglycaemia.  
Of note, renal function was determined using the Zappitelli formula. This CysC-based GFR prediction 
equation is not often used but is reported to provide accurate estimations of GFR in comparison with 
the Schwartz method. It is known that the Cockcroft-Gold formula is suboptimal for estimating GFR in 
children. Also, in light of the limited importance of renal excretion for linagliptin (only 5% eliminated in 
urine), this aspect will not be pursued. 
In the popPK model, descriptive comparison of exposure by subgroups of covariates suggested no 
difference in the PK between children/adolescents and adults concerning body weight, sex, and 
antidiabetic background therapy at baseline. In summary, these popPK analyses support the 
comparability of the linagliptin PK between paediatric and adult T2DM patients. 
Exposure-effect 
The relationship between linagliptin exposure and HbA1c was investigated using a PK/PD model, which 
was modified from a previously developed model to which the new paediatric data were added. The 
model appears sufficiently validated. 
In the comparison of paediatric and adult patients, paediatric patients had lower maximum inhibition 
(Imax) compared to adults. In Monte Carlo simulations, the simulated placebo-adjusted change from 
baseline HbA1c in adults was larger than that of paediatric patients both without prior insulin use 
(median adult: -0.614%; paediatric: -0.409%), and with prior insulin use (median adult: -0.647%; 
paediatric: -0.527%), thus indicating a smaller drug effect for paediatric compared to adult patients. 
Variability in response was higher in paediatric patients.   
In summary, there was a smaller effect of linagliptin treatment observed in children compared to 
adults. 
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
This overview summarises the results from trials 1218.91 and 1218.56 (Table 1: 1). Trial 1218.91 
(DINAMOTM) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial with 
3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in children from 10 
to ≤17 years of age ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/212741/2023  
Page 17/50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: 1). Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., non 
responders) were re-randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 
25 mg empagliflozin. The trial included a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 
52 weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or 
empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg). Trial 1218.91 includes the main trial DINAMOTM (presented in this 
dossier), and the ancillary trial DINAMOTM Mono which is still ongoing. DINAMOTM Mono includes 
treatment-naïve patients or patients who are not on active treatment and are treated with trial drug as 
monotherapy. The recruitment for DINAMOTM Mono has been terminated early in agreement with the 
FDA due to recruitment challenges and because current information suggested no clinically meaningful 
difference between monotherapy versus add-on to metformin and/or insulin. 
Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dose-
finding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children and 
adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM. 
The majority of the treated patients in 1218.91 (91.1%, 143 of 157) and 29.7% of the treated patients 
(11 of 37) in 1218.56 took metformin as background antidiabetic medication at baseline. In trial 
1218.91, 63 of the 143 patients on metformin also took insulin as an antidiabetic background 
medication (in total 63 of 157 treated patients, 40.1%). In addition, 5 of 157 patients (3.2%) had only 
insulin as background antidiabetic medication. 
Based on the results of the paediatric clinical programme, BI intends to seek to include results into the 
product information (information on clinical trials) for linagliptin and linagliptin/metformin for the 
treatment of paediatric patients with T2DM.

Overview of the trial design for 1218.91 
Data of these 2 trials were not pooled for efficacy analyses. Reasons were the different time point of 
primary endpoint assessment (1218.91: at 26 weeks; 1218.56: at 12 weeks) and because trial 
1218.56 was discontinued prior to complete recruitment based on a predefined interim analysis to 
allow early elimination of the potentially ineffective lowest dose of linagliptin 1 mg. 
Assessors comments 
Trial 1218.91 (DINAMOTM) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-
group trial with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks 
in children from 10 to ≤17 years of age. The design is complex but acceptable because it answered 
the call from regulators and experts for multi-arm efficacy and safety studies in paediatric patients, 
given the recruitment challenges in this population. 
Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., non-responders) were 
re-randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increased to 25 mg 
empagliflozin. The trial also included a double-blind, active treatment safety extension period up to 
52 weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or 
empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg).  
Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dose-
finding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children 
and adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM. 
In addition to the safety analyses of trials 1218.91 and 1218.56 presented in the CTRs, safety data of 
the 2 trials were pooled into 2 groupings: 
•  SAF-p1 (all patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg up to Week 52) provides a complete account 
of observed safety data for linagliptin 5 mg over the entire treatment duration 
•  SAF-p2 (placebo-controlled trials up to Week 26) provides a comprehensive comparison of 
linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo 
Bayesian analysis 
In December 2021, BI performed a blinded variability assessment of the primary endpoint in trial 
1218.91 with available data for 141 patients. The observed blinded standard deviation (SD = 1.65%) 
was considerably higher than the anticipated covariate-adjusted SD = 0.9% in the sample size 
determination in the CTP. Consequently, reduced power could be expected for the primary analysis of 
DINAMOTM unless a greater treatment effect than anticipated was to be observed. Therefore, BI

performed supplemental analyses to trial 1218.91 using Bayesian borrowing from simulated paediatric 
patients with T2DM based on exposure-response analyses of historical adult and paediatric patients 
with T2DM treated with linagliptin [c39218174]. The objective was to provide supportive evidence for 
the effectiveness of linagliptin in paediatric patients. Linagliptin has been extensively studied in adult 
populations, and well-developed PK/PD models supported inference in a paediatric population. 
Bayesian analyses were performed using 2 different methods to derive the prior distribution for the 
placebo-corrected treatment effect. One method was to use pharmacometric modelling of the 
exposure-response relationship of linagliptin based on available historical data in adult and paediatric 
patients with T2DM by simulating individual and placebo-corrected mean changes in HbA1c in a 
paediatric population with baseline characteristics matching the DINAMOTM population in relevant 
covariates.  
The second approach used the placebo-corrected treatment effects reported for paediatric populations 
with T2DM treated with sitagliptin to inform the prior distribution. In both approaches, the prior 
distribution was robustified with a weakly-informative mixture component to allow for the possibility of 
prior-data conflict. The decision rule to conclude superior efficacy was a posterior probability of 97.5% 
of the placebo-corrected treatment effect being less than 0, as measured by the change in HbA1c.  
EMA and compliance with the PIP 
The PIP (EMEA-000498-PIP01-08-M10) for linagliptin contains waivers for children <10 years and 
requires clinical trials to investigate T2DM in the paediatric population. For trial 1218.56, the PDCO 
confirmed that BI had conducted and performed the trial according to the agreed PIP 000498-PIP01-08 
and the respective key binding elements. A statement of compliance with the agreed completed PIP is 
pending at the time of finalisation of this document.  
FDA and compliance with the post-marketing requirement and written request 
Based on the medical need of paediatric patients with T2DM and to address the Pediatric Research 
Equity Act requirements, trials in paediatric patients have been agreed with the FDA as post-marketing 
requirements (1218.91 and 1218.56). Furthermore, the FDA issued a written request (trial 1218.91). 
All trial elements are met as agreed with the FDA as part of the paediatric post-marketing 
requirements and written request.  
All trials were performed in compliance with GCP and in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and BI standard operating procedures. All CTPs were approved by institutional review 
boards or independent ethics committees. In accordance with GCP and according to the local 
regulatory and legal requirements, informed consent/assent was obtained from all patients/parent(s) 
or the patient’s legally accepted representative.

The primary endpoint was analysed based on an ANCOVA model using multiple imputation with 
consecutive ‘wash-out’ (primary hypotheses for TG1; see Figure 4: 1 box with dashed red borderline) 
and ‘inverse probability weighting’ approaches (secondary hypotheses for TG2 and TG3; see Figure 4: 
1 box with dashed red borderline). The ‘wash-out’ approach imputed missing off-treatment values in 
active treatment groups based on the primary endpoint distribution in the placebo group. The 
hypotheses were tested hierarchically in a confirmatory setting. The primary family of hypotheses 
consisted of 2 pairwise comparisons of the treatment effect of empagliflozin pooled doses versus 
placebo and linagliptin versus placebo (TG1), followed by the secondary family of hypothesis 
comparing the effect of each empagliflozin dose regimen with placebo (TG2 and TG3). To test the 
primary hypotheses, the effect of linagliptin and of empagliflozin was compared with placebo at an 
overall α of 0.05 (2-sided) using the Hochberg method to account for multiple testing. Only after 
achieving statistically significant results for both comparisons in the ‘wash-out’ approach, were the 
secondary hypotheses (ANCOVA with ‘wash-out’ plus ‘inverse probability weighting’ approach) tested 
to compare the individual empagliflozin doses versus placebo.

Patient characteristics 
Although this clinical overview focuses on data for linagliptin compared with placebo, the entire patient 
population is described in this section, including the empagliflozin pooled group, to provide the 
characteristics of all patients in this trial. 
Trial 1218.91  
Trial 1218.91 was carried out at 78 clinical sites in 13 countries in Asia, Europe, North and South 
America. In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin 
pooled (52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment (

Figure 1: 1). The initial randomisation was stratified by age and sex. The re-randomisations at Week 14 
and Week 26 were stratified by the age documented at the initial randomisation. All but 1 randomised 
patient (linagliptin group, withdrawal from trial) were treated with at least 1 dose of trial medication.  
The majority of patients (140 patients, 89.2%) completed the planned observation time of 55 weeks 
(regardless of completion of planned treatment with trial medication). The majority of patients 
remained on treatment with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 (130 
patients, 82.8%). The frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations were 
generally comparable across treatment groups. The most common reason for premature 
discontinuation of trial medication was the withdrawal by the patient (Week 26: 10 patients, 6.4%; 
Week 52: 16 patients, 10.2%). Based on TG6 (complete active treatment period excluding placebo), 
the median exposure to active trial medication up to Week 52 was 362 days (about 12 months; min: 1 
day, max: 393 days), with 58.3% of patients treated for at least 46 weeks with active trial medication. 
As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were <15 years of age (i.e., 76 patients, 
48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e., 97 patients, 61.8%). 
The mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9). More than half of the patient 
population participated in North America (mostly USA). Most patients were White (78 patients, 49.7%) 
or Black/African American (49 patients, 31.2%).  
About half of the patients (80 patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took 
metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, 
with balanced distribution across treatment groups. Thus, the majority of the treated patients in trial 
1218.91 (91.1%, 143 of 157) took metformin as antidiabetic background medication at baseline.  
Patients with insufficient glycaemic control of HbA1c ≥6.5% and ≤10.5% could participate in this trial. 
About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of <8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining 
patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 
25.5%) or of >9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean baseline FPG was 158.70 mg/dL (SD 55.56). As 
per the inclusion criteria, patients had to be negative for both islet cell antigen auto-antibodies and 
glutamic acid decarboxylase auto-antibodies. Most patients had been diagnosed with T2DM for 1 to 
3 years (66 patients, 42.0%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body weight was 
99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric population. The 
mean fasting C-peptide values at baseline were 0.9932 nmol/L. The mean eGFR was 
129.79 mL/min/1.73 m2. Normal UACR (<30 mg/g crea) was reported for 73.9% of patients, while 
21.0% of patients had microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/g crea), and 3.8% had macroalbuminuria 
(>300 mg/g crea). The modified Tanner staging was used to assess the patient’s pubertal stage; a 
total of 93 patients (59.2%) had a Tanner stage of 5 (i.e., fully developed) and 64 patients (40.8%) 
had a Tanner stage of 2 to 4 (i.e., partially developed). Demographic and clinical characteristics were 
generally balanced between the randomised treatment groups. 
Trial 1218.56  
Overall, 83 patients were enrolled. Of those, 39 patients were randomised and treated (placebo: 15 
patients; linagliptin 1 mg: 10 patients; linagliptin 5 mg: 14 patients). Three of the treated patients 
(7.7%) prematurely discontinued trial medication; none of these patients discontinued because of AEs.  
Of the 39 patients, 21 patients (53.8%) were female. Most of the patients were from study centres in 
Europe (18 patients, 46.2%) or South America (12 patients, 30.8%). The majority of patients were 
White (23 patients, 59.0%). The mean age at screening was 14.0 years (SD 1.9 years). The mean 
baseline weight was 79.8 kg (SD 22.2 kg; range: 47 to 139 kg); Almost all patients were obese (BMI

HbA1c at baseline was 7.86% (SD 0.95%). The mean baseline FPG was 152.7 mg/dL (SD 45.6 mg/dL). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. Mean 
baseline HbA1c (%) was numerically greater in the linagliptin 1 mg group (8.22 [SD 0.93]) than in the 
placebo group (7.60 [SD 0.92]) and linagliptin 5 mg group (7.87 [SD 0.98]). Slight differences 
between treatment groups were not unexpected due to the small sample size. 
Overall, 29.7% of the treated patients (11 of 37) in 1218.56 took metformin as background 
antidiabetic medication at baseline. 
Assessors comments 
Trial 1218.91  
In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin 
pooled (52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. The majority of patients 
remained on treatment with trial drug up to Week 26 (140 patients, 89.2%) and up to Week 52 
(130 patients, 82.8%).The frequencies of patients with premature treatment discontinuations 
were generally comparable across treatment groups. 
As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were <15 years of age (i.e., 76 
patients, 48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e., 97 
patients, 61.8%). The mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9).About half of 
the patients (80 patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus 
insulin, and 5 patients (3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with 
balanced distribution across treatment groups. 
Although the study was done in multiple geographic regions (North America, South America, 
Europe, and Asia), most participants were enrolled in the Americas, which limits generalizability 
to the broader worldwide population of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes.  
About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of <8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the 
remaining patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% 
(40 patients, 25.5%) or of >9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 
8.33). The mean body weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg 
observed in this paediatric population.   
Trial 1218.56  
Overall, 83 patients were enrolled. Of those, 39 patients were randomised and treated (placebo: 
15 patients; linagliptin 1 mg: 10 patients; linagliptin 5 mg: 14 patients). Three of the treated 
patients (7.7%) prematurely discontinued trial medication; none of these patients discontinued 
because of AEs.  
Of the 39 patients, 21 patients (53.8%) were female. The mean age at screening was 14.0 years 
(SD 1.9 years). The mean baseline weight was 79.8 kg (SD 22.2 kg; range: 47 to 139 kg); 
Almost all patients were obese (BMI SDS ≥2: 25 patients, 64.1%) or overweight (BMI SDS 1.28 
to <2: 8 patients, 20.5%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.86% (SD 0.95%). The mean 
baseline FPG was 152.7 mg/dL (SD 45.6 mg/dL). Demographic and baseline characteristics were 
generally balanced across treatment groups. Mean baseline HbA1c (%) was numerically greater 
in the linagliptin 1 mg group (8.22 [SD 0.93]) than in the placebo group (7.60 [SD 0.92]) and 
linagliptin 5 mg group (7.87 [SD 0.98]). We agree with the MAH that slight differences between 
treatment groups were not unexpected due to the small sample size.

7.2.  Results 
Trial 1218.91 (DINAMOTM) 
Although this clinical overview focuses on data for linagliptin compared with placebo, the entire patient 
population (including the empagliflozin pooled group) is described for certain endpoints in this section 
to mirror the primary analyses which included testing of both active substances versus placebo. 
Primary confirmatory endpoint 
The hierarchical testing results for DINAMOTM are shown in Figure 4: 2. Based on TG1 (box with 
dashed red borderline in Figure 4: 2), the treatment effect of linagliptin 5 mg compared with placebo 
was not statistically significant, while the effect of empagliflozin treatment (pooled) was clinically 
meaningful and statistically superior to placebo in lowering HbA1c from baseline after 26 weeks ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/212741/2023

Table 4: 1). Since the primary hypotheses based on TG1 could not be both rejected, the hierarchical 
testing for TG2 and TG3 was not continued (

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint showed results consistent with the primary analyses 
(Figure 4: 3). For linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo, the primary analysis results were consistent across the 
subgroups, as the point estimates of all subgroups were included in the 95% CI of the overall 
population [c38245139, Figure 15.2.1.3: 1].

Bayesian borrowing analysis 
Population simulations based on the previously-fitted pharmacometric models resulted in a population 
mean treatment effect estimate for linagliptin of −0.64%, with a standard error of the mean of 0.02%.

Prior standard deviations were set at values in excess of the simulation-based standard errors in order 
to conform to the prespecified effective sample size constraint. Prior distributions were updated with 
the DINAMOTM data (trial 1218.91) to obtain posterior distributions. 
The posterior mean of the placebo-corrected treatment effect for linagliptin was −0.51% (95% credible 
interval: −0.92%, −0.05%), and there was a 98% posterior probability of superior efficacy. This result 
provided evidence for superior efficacy at the prespecified evidence threshold using the prespecified 
weight (65%) for the informative component of the prior based on the pharmacometric simulation 
results. In the tipping point sensitivity analysis, the posterior probability of superior efficacy decreased 
with decreasing weight used for the informative component of the prior, but point estimates showed a 
numerically beneficial effect across all sensitivity analyses.  
In conclusion, the Bayesian borrowing analysis based on the exposure-response provided evidence for 
superior efficacy of linagliptin with an overall probability for superiority of 0.98, with a point estimate 
of −0.51% and 95% credible interval (−0.92%, −0.05%) [c39218174]. 
Fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure 
All secondary endpoints were exploratory; a summary of the results is provided in Table 4: 2. The 
trend for changes in FPG was consistent with HbA1c. For linagliptin, the analysis of FPG did not show a 
relevant difference at Week 26 when compared with baseline values. The sensitivity analysis for FPG 
based on OC instead of OC-AD-BOCF showed the same trend [c38245139, Table 15.2.2: 7].  
No obvious changes over time in body weight, SBP, and DBP were observed for linagliptin versus 
placebo (Table 4: 2).

Endpoints related to HbA1c  
The proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c <6.5% or <7.0% at the end of 26 weeks and 52 weeks 
and the proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c reduction of >0.5% in absolute value at the end of 
26 and 52 weeks are summarised in Figure 4: 4. 
At Week 26, there were only small differences between linagliptin 5 mg and placebo in the proportion 
of patients reaching a response based on HbA1c (<6.5% or <7.0%).

In the placebo group, mean HbA1c increased over the 26 weeks by 0.68%, indicating rapid disease 
progression despite that the majority of patients (94.3%) had background metformin and/or insulin 
treatment at baseline. The reduction in HbA1c in the linagliptin group was apparent at the first 
assessment (Week 4) and the difference to placebo appeared to be maintained up to Week 26. From 
Week 26 to 52, no control using placebo was available due to the trial design; the trend in the 
linagliptin group was consistent with that from Week 12 to 26 (Figure 4: 5).

Glycaemic rescue therapy 
The use of rescue therapy was defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria:  
•  Any new addition of antidiabetic therapy introduced after the first dose of study treatment 
•  Any total daily dose increase of basal insulin of more than 0.1 IU/kg above the baseline 
prescribed dose for more than 21 consecutive days 
Up to Week 26, the proportion of patients who initiated glycaemic rescue therapy was comparable 
between placebo (6 patients, 11.3%) and linagliptin 5 mg (4 patients, 7.7%). Up to Week 52 (long-
term analysis for the active substances based on the initial randomisation), 11 patients (21.2%) in the 
linagliptin 5 mg group initiated glycaemic rescue therapy; 7 of these 11 patients initiated glycaemic 
rescue after Week 26. 
C-peptide, UACR, and eGFR 
No obvious changes over time in fasting serum C-peptide, UACR, or eGFR were observed for any 
treatment group in this trial. 
Assessors comments 
For the primary end point, the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline was −0.34% (95% 
CI −0.99 - 0.30, p=0.2935). 
Assessment report  
EMA/212741/2023

For the secondary outcomes, the adjusted mean change in FPG was -5.4 mg/dL (-0.3 mmol/L; -
28-49 to 17.67 [-1-58 to 0-98)) for linagliptin versus placebo. At Week 26, there were only 
small differences between linagliptin 5 mg and placebo in the proportion of patients reaching a 
response based on HbA1c (<6.5% or <7.0%).  
The adjusted mean change in bodyweight from baseline to week 26 was 1.46 kg (-0.48 to 3.41 
in the linagliptin versus placebo group. The adjusted mean change in systolic blood pressure with 
linagliptin versus placebo was 0.91 mm Hg (-2.40 to 4.22). No decreases in diastolic blood 
pressure from baseline were observed. 
Trial 1218.56 
There was a dose-dependent, placebo-corrected median HbA1c change from baseline at Week 12 of -
0.55% with linagliptin 1 mg and of -0.80% with linagliptin 5 mg in trial 1218.56 [c02827550]. 
Furthermore, there was a placebo-corrected median FPG change from baseline at Week 12 of +10.0 
mg/dL with linagliptin 1 mg and of -24.5 mg/dL with linagliptin 5 mg; the reduction in FPG in the 
linagliptin 5 mg group is considered clinically meaningful.  
Linagliptin at a dose of 5 mg once daily showed an inhibition of DPP-4. In the linagliptin 5 mg group, 
median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 78.9% (interquartile range 67.7 to 84.0%). This 
degree of DDP-4 inhibition is in line with the data obtained for linagliptin in adults at the therapeutic 
dose regimen of 5 mg once daily. In studies 1218.5 [U08-3761] and 1218.6 [U08-1056], the median 
DPP-4 inhibition after 12 weeks of treatment at 5 mg once daily was 82.5% and 85.0%, respectively. 
In trial 1218.56, the degree of DPP-4 inhibition by linagliptin 1 mg once daily (median inhibition: 
38.4% [interquartile range 26.9 to 48.8%]) was clearly lower than by linagliptin 5 mg once daily. The 
inhibition observed for the 1 mg dose in the current trial was lower than the inhibition observed in 2 
studies in adults evaluating the 1 mg dose level. In trial 1218.6 [U08-1056] and trial 1218.2 [U06-
1139], the median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 62.0% and 60.0%, respectively. 
Assessors comments 
There was a dose-dependent, placebo-corrected median HbA1c change from baseline at Week 
12 of -0.55% with linagliptin 1 mg and of -0.80% with linagliptin 5 mg. In addition, in the 
linagliptin 5 mg group, median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 78.9% 
(interquartile range 67.7 to 84.0%). This degree of DDP 4 inhibition is in line with the data 
obtained for linagliptin in adults. Overall, the efficacy and PD data obtained in the paediatric trial 
1218.56 were consistent with those in adults with T2DM. 
7.3.  Discussion 
Dose finding study  
Trial 1218.56 was a Phase II b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group dose-
finding trial of linagliptin (1 mg or 5 mg administered orally once daily) over 12 weeks in children and 
adolescents from 10 to ≤17 years of age, with T2DM. 
In trial 1218.56, the primary endpoint of the final analysis was the change from baseline in HbA1c (%) 
after 12 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoint of the final analysis was the PD endpoint 
DPP-4 inhibition (%) at trough at steady state. Trial 1218.91  
Overall, 83 patients were enrolled. There was a dose-dependent, placebo-corrected median HbA1c 
change from baseline at Week 12 of -0.55% with linagliptin 1 mg and of -0.80% with linagliptin 5 mg.

In addition, in the linagliptin 5 mg group, median DPP-4 inhibition at trough at steady-state was 78.9% 
(interquartile range 67.7 to 84.0%). This degree of DDP 4 inhibition is in line with the data obtained 
for linagliptin in adults.  
Design phase 3 trial 
Trial 1218.91 (DINAMOTM) was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group 
trial with 3 treatment arms (placebo, 5 mg linagliptin, 10 mg empagliflozin) lasting 26 weeks in 
children from 10 to ≤17 years of age. The design is complex, but acceptable, because it answered the 
call from regulators and experts for multi-arm efficacy and safety studies in paediatric patients, given 
the challenges of recruitment in this population. 
Patients on empagliflozin who did not achieve HbA1c <7.0% at Week 12 (i.e., non responders) were re-
randomised at Week 14 to either continue with 10 mg empagliflozin or increase to 25 mg 
empagliflozin. The trial also included a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 
weeks: patients on placebo were re-randomised at Week 26 to receive either linagliptin or 
empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg).  
Endpoints 
In trial 1218.91, primary confirmatory endpoint was the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to the end 
of 26 weeks. Secondary endpoints include the change in fasting glucose (mg/dL) and change in body 
weight (kg) from baseline to the end of 26 weeks. 
Patients 
In total, 158 patients were randomised to double-blind linagliptin (53 patients), empagliflozin pooled 
(52 patients), or placebo (53 patients) once daily treatment. 
As intended, between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were <15 years of age (i.e., 76 patients, 
48.4%) and between 30% and 70% of randomised patients were female (i.e., 97 patients, 61.8%). 
The mean age of the patient population was 14.5 years (SD 1.9).About half of the patients (80 
patients, 51.0%) took only metformin, 63 patients (40.1%) took metformin plus insulin, and 5 patients 
(3.2%) had only insulin as background antidiabetic medication, with balanced distribution across 
treatment groups. 
Although the study was done in multiple geographic regions (North America, South America, Europe, 
and Asia), most participants were enrolled in the Americas, which limits generalizability to the broader 
worldwide population of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes.  
About half of the patients had baseline HbA1c values of <8% (83 patients, 52.9); for the remaining 
patients, approximately similar proportions had either HbA1c values of 8.0% to 9.0% (40 patients, 
25.5%) or of >9% (34 patients, 21.7%). The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2 (SD 8.33). The mean body 
weight was 99.92 kg (SD 26.78), with a maximum weight of 171.0 kg observed in this paediatric 
population.  
Results 
For the primary end point, the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline was −0.34% (95% CI 
−0.99 - 0.30, p=0.2935). 
For the secondary outcomes, the adjusted mean change in FPG was -5.4 mg/dL (-0.3 mmol/L; -28-49 
to 17.67 [-1-58 to 0-98)) for linagliptin versus placebo. At Week 26, there were only small differences 
Assessment report

between linagliptin 5 mg and placebo in the proportion of patients reaching a response based on 
HbA1c (<6.5% or <7.0%).  
The adjusted mean change in bodyweight from baseline to week 26 was 1.46 kg (-0.48 to 3.41 in the 
linagliptin versus placebo group. The adjusted mean change in systolic blood pressure with linagliptin 
versus placebo was 0.91 mm Hg (-2.40 to 4.22). No decreases in diastolic blood pressure from 
baseline were observed. 
Several factors might explain the reduced responsiveness to Linagliptin in young people with type 2 
diabetes. First, there is a combination of the early development of insulin resistance and more rapid 
deterioration of beta-cell function in children and adolescents compared with adults with type 2 
diabetes. Further, the added physiological insulin resistance of puberty is present in adolescents and 
not adults. Last, BMI in youth¬onset type 2 diabetes is often higher than in adults with type 2 
diabetes.  
Conclusion 
The 12-week dose-finding trial 1218.56 showed clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c at Week 12 in 
the linagliptin 5 mg group. However, in the 26-week Phase III trial 1218.91, treatment with 5 mg 
linagliptin was not associated with a relevant reduction in HbA1c (−0.34%, p = 0.2935). 
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Analyses for SAF-p1 and SAF-p2 
In addition to the safety analyses in the individual trials (see Table 1: 1), the safety data of the 2 trials 
were pooled as SAF-p1 and SAF-p2 and described below with a focus on SAF-p2 (placebo-controlled 
trials up to Week 26).  
Safety analyses followed the ‘treatment-emergent’ principle and included all treated patients. Unless 
otherwise specified, treatment was assigned as randomised, and the analyses of AEs were based on 
the number of patients with AEs. AE analyses were restricted to on-treatment AEs, defined as AEs with 
an onset date between the first trial medication intake and 7 days after the last intake, unless 
otherwise stated. Exposure-adjusted AEs were also displayed as incidence rates per 100 patient-years. 
Standard AE summaries 
In SAF-p2, the median exposure to the trial medication was 181.5 days for placebo and 180.5 days for 
linagliptin 5 mg, in the placebo-controlled period. In SAF-p1, the median exposure to linagliptin 5 mg 
was 359.0 days, with a maximum of 378 days. Total exposure to linagliptin 5 mg was 58.5 years. Most 
patients in SAF-p1 (82.9%) and SAF-p2 (78.4%) came from trial 1218.91. 
In SAF-p2, the rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable, 
as were the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs (Table 5: 
1).

Most frequently reported AEs 
In SAF-p2, on the PT level, the most frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache 
(8 patients, 11.8%) and hypoglycaemia, vitamin D deficiency, diarrhoea, and cough (each reported for 
5 patients, 7.4%). In the linagliptin 5 mg group, the most frequently reported AEs by PT were 
headache (13 patients, 19.7%), hypoglycaemia (11 patients, 16.7%), vomiting (5 patients, 7.6%), 
and abdominal pain and increased blood ketone body (each 4 patients, 6.1%). 
The only imbalance in rates of AEs by PT between the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups was in the 
rate of hypoglycaemia, which was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. For other AEs, by PT, 
there were no relevant differences in rates for placebo compared with the linagliptin 5 mg group. 
The rates and pattern of AEs reported for the linagliptin 5 mg group (by SOC and PT) in SAF-p1 were 
comparable with the rates of AEs reported for the linagliptin 5 mg group in SAF-p2. 
Adverse events by intensity 
In SAF-p2, the majority of adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, and rates of AEs by 
intensity were generally comparable between placebo and the linagliptin 5 mg groups. Severe AEs 
were reported for 3 patients (4.4%) on placebo and 1 patient (1.5%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group. In 
the linagliptin 5 mg group, the severe AE abdominal pain was not considered to be drug-related and 
was not an SAE. No severe AE was reported for >1 patient in either treatment group. The results 
based on SAF-p1 were generally comparable with SAF-p2. 
Drug-related adverse events 
In SAF-p2, few AEs were reported as drug-related AEs and there were no relevant differences between 
the treatment groups with regard to rates or the pattern of reporting of drug-related AEs. On the PT 
level, few drug-related AEs were reported by >1 patient. On placebo, hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia were each reported for 2 patients (2.9%). Drug-related AEs reported for >1 patient in 
the linagliptin 5 mg group were: hypoglycaemia (5 patients, 7.6%) and nausea and vulvovaginal 
mycotic infection (each reported for 2 patients, 3.0%). The results based on SAF-p1 were generally 
comparable with SAF-p2.

AEs leading to discontinuation 
In SAF-p2, there were no AEs leading to discontinuation for patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group and 
2 patients (2.9%) discontinued from placebo (PTs: acute pancreatitis, polyuria, and irregular 
menstruation, each reported for 1 patient [1.5%]). The results based on SAF-p1 were generally 
comparable with SAF-p2.  
SAEs 
Based on SAF-p2, there was no relevant difference between groups with regard to SAEs. 
Three patients (4.4%) on placebo and 2 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group had SAEs. 
Hyperglycaemia was reported as an SAE for 2 patients (2.9%) on placebo. No other SAE (on the PT 
level) was reported for >1 patient in either treatment group.  
No patient had any fatal AE (Table 5: 1). One patient (on placebo) had 6 SAEs that were considered to 
be life-threatening (PTs: acute pancreatitis [onset Day 24], and systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, and hypovolaemic 
shock; all with an onset on Day 25).  
Based on SAF-p1, SAEs were reported for 8 patients (9.8%) on linagliptin 5 mg. Diabetic ketoacidosis 
was reported in 2 patients (2.4%); all other SAEs were each reported for 1 patient (1.2%) (PTs: 
asthma, increased blood glucose, breast abscess, chorioretinitis, hyperglycaemia, and 
pneumomediastinum). 
Assessors comments 
Exposure 
The median exposure to the trial medication was 181.5 days for placebo and 180.5 days for 
linagliptin 5 mg, in the placebo-controlled period.  
AEs  
The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable. The 
most frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache (8 patients, 11.8%) and

patient in the linagliptin 5 mg group were: hypoglycaemia (5 patients, 7.6%) and nausea and 
vulvovaginal mycotic infection (each reported for 2 patients, 3.0%). 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation for patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group and 2 
patients (2.9%) discontinued from placebo  
SAEs 
There was no relevant difference between groups with regard to SAEs. Three patients (4.4%) on 
placebo and 2 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group had SAEs. Hyperglycaemia was 
reported as an SAE for 2 patients (2.9%) on placebo. No other SAE (on the PT level) was 
reported for >1 patient in either treatment group.  
No patient had any fatal AE  
AESIs and specific AEs 
AESIs (adverse events of special interest) and specific AEs that represent medical concepts were 
analysed in trials 1218.91 and 1218.56. Those AESIs common to both trials were analysed for the 
pooled safety. In addition, specific AEs for the pooled safety analyses were defined in the SCS SAP. For 
SAF-p1 and SAF-p2, these medical concepts were analysed by MedDRA queries (SMQ, BIcMQ, HLGT, 
or HLT; or identified by the investigators.  
In SAF-p2, with the exception of hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of 
the placebo-controlled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups (Table 5: 3). 
In SAF-p2, the rate of hypoglycaemic events was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. However, 
based on data from trial 1218.91 (which comprised the majority of patients included in SAF-p2), there 
was no relevant difference between treatment groups with regard to rates of symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia. In SAF-p2, most patients with hypoglycaemic events had at least 1 event with plasma 
glucose values <54 mg/dL. No patient had an event that required assistance. Note that most of the 
patients in SAF-p2 were on background antidiabetic medication. In SAF-p1, there was no relevant 
increase in rates of investigator-defined hypoglycaemia for patients on linagliptin 5 mg (16 patients, 
19.5%) when compared with SAF-p2 (11 patients, 16.7%). No patient had any severe event that 
required assistance.

CEC-adjudicated events in trial 1218.91 
Up to Week 26, 4 patients had events that met the criteria for adjudication for ketoacidosis and 1 
event was confirmed as certain ketoacidosis (placebo). Four patients had events that met the criteria 
for adjudication for myocardial infarction and hospitalisation for heart failure; in all cases the outcome 
was not confirmed. No events met the criteria for adjudication for stroke or TIA, death, or hepatic 
injury. 
Up to Week 52, 2 patients on linagliptin 5 mg had events that met the criteria for adjudication for 
ketoacidosis and were confirmed by the CEC (a further 5 patients had events that were not confirmed 
as diabetic ketoacidosis). One confirmed event was an AESI (the patient had a BMI of 42.9 kg/m2 and 
had missed a week of insulin treatment before the diabetic ketoacidosis) and the other confirmed 
event was identified on the basis of elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate. No corresponding AE of increased 
beta-hydroxybutyrate or AESI of diabetic ketoacidosis was reported for this event. No further details, 
including laboratory results, therapy, and action taken with the trial medication, were available in the 
eCRF. This laboratory-related event was confirmed by the CEC as certain, moderate ketoacidosis.

One event met the criteria for adjudication for hepatic injury and was confirmed as mild to moderate 
hepatic injury (linagliptin 5 mg active); the CEC assessed the causality of hepatic injury as unlikely, 
and the event was mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and the patient recovered. Three 
patients had events that met the criteria for adjudication for myocardial infarction and hospitalisation 
for heart failure; no event was confirmed by the CEC. No events met the criteria for adjudication for 
stroke or TIA, or death. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
The pooled analysis of safety laboratory data was limited to frequency of possibly clinically significant 
abnormalities (PCSAs) based on BI standard criteria. There were no relevant differences between 
placebo and linagliptin 5 mg with regard to changes in safety laboratory parameters. 
In trial 1218.91, there were no notable changes in cholesterol or triglyceride values from baseline to 
Week 52 in any treatment group and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups. 
There were no notable changes in IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and markers of bone turnover from baseline to 
Week 52 in any treatment group and there were no relevant differences among the treatment groups. 
NTx, P1NP, IGF-1, and IGF-BP3 were analysed in subgroups according to sex and Tanner staging score 
at baseline. There were no relevant differences among treatment groups in subgroup analyses by sex 
and baseline Tanner score. For other safety laboratory parameters, differences between placebo and 
active treatment were consistent with the known safety profile of linagliptin. There were no notable 
differences with regard to frequencies of PCSAs between placebo and linagliptin.  
In trial 1218.56, there were no clinically relevant findings concerning laboratory assessments. 
Vital signs 
SBP and DBP are described as efficacy endpoints in trial 1218.91. No obvious changes over time in 
body SBP or DBP were observed for linagliptin versus placebo. There were no relevant differences 
between placebo and linagliptin in trial 1218.91 with regard to heart rate and growth assessments 
(weight, height, BMI, and growth velocity). 
In trial 1218.56, there were no clinically relevant findings concerning vital signs. 
Safety in special situations 
Drug interactions 
In trial 1218.91, descriptive analysis did not show any influence of baseline antidiabetic medication on 
linagliptin exposure. 
Drug interactions were not specifically studied in the paediatric trials. See the currently approved 
product information of linagliptin for adults for more information. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
The use of linagliptin during pregnancy and lactation was not specifically studied in the paediatric 
trials. See the currently approved product information of linagliptin for adults for more information. In 
the paediatric clinical trials, no pregnancies were reported. 
Overdose 
Overdose of linagliptin was not specifically studied in the paediatric trials. See the currently approved 
product information of linagliptin for adults for more information. 
Drug abuse 
Assessment report  
EMA/212741/2023  
Page 41/50 
 
 
 
Linagliptin is not a controlled substance. Abuse of linagliptin was not specifically studied in the 
paediatric trials. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
Withdrawal and rebound effects of linagliptin were not specifically studied in the paediatric trials. 
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
Linagliptin’s effect on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability were not 
specifically studied in the paediatric trials. 
Post-marketing experience 
Linagliptin is not registered for commercial use in paediatric patients in any part of the world. 
Information on the post-marketing experience in adults is provided in the current PBRER. 
Until the data lock point of 02 May 2022, off-label use of linagliptin in paediatric patients was 
documented for 44 patients. Off-label use of linagliptin/metformin (fixed-dose combination) in 
paediatric patients was documented for 9 patients. No relevant difference in the safety profile was 
observed between adults and paediatric patients below 18 years of age.  
Assessors comments 
AEs of special interest and specific AEs 
AEs of special interest and specific AEs were hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema, 
angioedema like events, and anaphylaxis), skin lesions, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, hepatic 
injury, decreased renal function, hypoglycaemia, arthralgia, and pemphigoid in bullous 
conditions. 
Except for hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-
controlled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups. 
The rate of hypoglycaemic events was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. However, 
based on data from trial 1218.91, there was no relevant difference between treatment groups 
concerning rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. No patient had an event that required 
assistance.  
One event was confirmed as certain ketoacidosis (placebo).  
No events were reported in the linagliptin group for pemphigoid in bullous conditions (HLT-
primary path) and for pancreatitis.  
One event met the criteria for adjudication for hepatic injury and was confirmed as mild to 
moderate hepatic injury (linagliptin 5 mg active); the CEC assessed the causality of hepatic 
injury as unlikely, and the event was mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and the

8.2.  Discussion 
Exposure 
The median exposure to the trial medication was 181.5 days for placebo and 180.5 days for linagliptin 
5 mg, in the placebo-controlled period.  
AEs  
The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable. The most 
frequently reported AEs for patients on placebo were headache (8 patients, 11.8%) and 
hypoglycaemia, vitamin D deficiency, diarrhoea, and cough (each reported for 5 patients, 7.4%). In 
the linagliptin 5 mg group, the most frequently reported AEs by PT were headache (13 patients, 
19.7%), hypoglycaemia (11 patients, 16.7%), vomiting (5 patients, 7.6%), and abdominal pain and 
increased blood ketone body (each 4 patients, 6.1%). 
The only imbalance in rates of AEs by PT between the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups was in the 
rate of hypoglycaemia, which was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo.  
Severe AEs  
Severe AEs were reported for 3 patients (4.4%) on placebo and 1 patient (1.5%) in the linagliptin 5 
mg group.  
Drug-related AEs  
Few AEs were reported as drug-related AEs and there were no relevant differences between the 
treatment groups with regard to rates or the pattern of reporting of drug-related AEs. On the PT level, 
few drug-related AEs were reported by >1 patient. On placebo, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia 
were each reported for 2 patients (2.9%). Drug-related AEs reported for >1 patient in the linagliptin 5 
mg group were: hypoglycaemia (5 patients, 7.6%) and nausea and vulvovaginal mycotic infection 
(each reported for 2 patients, 3.0%). 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation for patients in the linagliptin 5 mg group and 2 patients 
(2.9%) discontinued from placebo  
SAEs 
There was no relevant difference between groups with regard to SAEs. Three patients (4.4%) on 
placebo and 2 patients (3.0%) in the linagliptin 5 mg group had SAEs. Hyperglycaemia was reported 
as an SAE for 2 patients (2.9%) on placebo. No other SAE (on the PT level) was reported for >1 
patient in either treatment group. No patient had any fatal AE. 
AEs of special interest and specific AEs 
AEs of special interest and specific AEs were hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema, 
angioedema like events, and anaphylaxis), skin lesions, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, hepatic injury, 
decreased renal function, hypoglycaemia, arthralgia, and pemphigoid in bullous conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/212741/2023

With the exception of hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-
controlled period were comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups. 
The rate of hypoglycaemic events was higher on linagliptin 5 mg than on placebo. However, based on 
data from trial 1218.91, there was no relevant difference between treatment groups with regard to 
rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. No patient had an event that required assistance.  
No events were reported in the linagliptin group for pemphigoid in bullous conditions (HLT-primary 
path) and for pancreatitis.  
One event met the criteria for adjudication for hepatic injury and was confirmed as mild to moderate 
hepatic injury (linagliptin 5 mg active); the CEC assessed the causality of hepatic injury as unlikely, 
and the event was mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and the patient recovered.  
Safety laboratory parameters  
There were no relevant differences between placebo and linagliptin 5 mg with regard to changes in 
safety laboratory parameters In trial 1218.91, there were no notable changes in cholesterol or 
triglyceride values from baseline to Week 52 in any treatment group and there were no relevant 
differences among the treatment groups.  
Conclusion 
The rates of any AEs in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups were generally comparable, as were 
the rates of severe AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and SAEs. Except for 
hypoglycaemia, the rates of AESIs and specific AEs up to the end of the placebo-controlled period were 
comparable in the placebo and linagliptin 5 mg groups. No unexpected safety concerns were identified 
for linagliptin in the paediatric programme. 
9.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to indicate 
the outcome of Study 1218-0091 in the paediatric population. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated 
accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1, which includes all changes to the Product Information.

N/A 
10.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  Regarding bioanalysis of linagliptin, samples were demonstrated to be stable for up to 416 
days. However, in Study 1218-0091, the maximum storage time was 1090 days, which is 
longer than the determined long-term stability period. Stability of linagliptin in plasma over 
1090 days should be shown.   
2.  Regarding the SmPC section 5.2, the sentence ‘The observed exposure-response relationship 
was overall comparable in paediatric and adult patients’ is not in line with the finding of a 
lesser effect on HbA1c in the paediatric population compared to adults. It is requested to either 
delete the sentence or substantiate this statement. Further, the mean concentration of 12.6 
nmol/l is based only on a single 1.5 h trough sample per subject and is not considered

Question 1  
Regarding bioanalysis of linagliptin, samples were demonstrated to be stable up to 416 days. However, 
in Study 1218-0091, the maximum storage time was 1090 days, which is longer than the determined 
long-term stability period. Stability of linagliptin in plasma over 1090 days should be shown. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Stability of linagliptin has meanwhile been demonstrated for up to 2986 days freezer storage:

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Additional stability information was provided that indicate stability up to 2986 days. This covers the 
maximum storage period of 1090 days.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved 
Question 2  
Regarding the SmPC section 5.2, the sentence ‘The observed exposure-response relationship was 
overall comparable in paediatric and adult patients’ is not in line with the finding of a lesser effect on 
HbA1c in the paediatric population as compared to adults. It is proposed either to delete the sentence 
or to indicate this difference. Further, the mean concentration of 12.6 nmol/l is based only on a single 
1.5 h and trough sample per subject and is therefore not considered representative for a real mean 
concentration. Only the trough concentration should be indicated. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In the comparison of pediatric and adult patients, pediatric patients exhibited a lower estimated 
maximum inhibition (Imax) compared to adults, with some overlap based upon the precision of the 
parameter estimates (0.0959 (0.0485, 0.159) vs. 0.141 (0.111, 0.200)). Consequently, simulations for 
placebo-adjusted change from baseline HbA1c indicated a smaller drug effect for pediatric compared to 
adult patients. However, variability in response was larger for pediatric patients, resulting in an overlap 
with the response in adult patients (see Figure 1). The tendency of a larger placebo-adjusted change 
from baseline HbA1c in patients requiring insulin was consistent in pediatric and adult patients. To 
indicate the difference in maximum inhibition, we suggest modifying the statement as follows: 
The observed exposure-response relationship was generally comparable between pediatric and adult 
patients, however, with a smaller drug effect estimated in children.

In addition to the geometric Mean (gMean) trough plasma concentration (N=39), the gMean plasma 
concentration measured at 1.5 hours post administration (N=46) was also included as it represents a 
concentration around tmax. The aim was to add information on absorption, rather than limiting the 
information to elimination. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The proposed text on the comparison of the paediatric and adult exposure-response, indicating a 
smaller effect in children, is agreed. 
With respect to the proposed mean concentration of 12.6 nmol/l, it is acknowledged that information 
on exposure around tmax may be beneficial for the prescriber. However, in order to increase clarity, 
the Applicant should modify the sentence as follows: 
The observed geometric mean trough concentrations and geometric mean concentrations at 1.5 hours 
post-administration (assumed to approximate the tmax) at steady state were 4.30 nmol/L and 
12.6 nmol/L, respectively.  
Further, providing more data on absorption is supported, however, it is noticeable that no Cmax nor 
Ctrough for adults is indicated in section 5.2. In order to be able to put the provided paediatric ‘Cmax’ 
and Ctrough information in perspective, the adult Cmax and Ctrough at steady-state should be 
provided in section 5.2 as well.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
BI acknowledges that the relation between time to maximum plasma concentration and 1.5 hours post 
drug administration should be made clear. Therefore, the following modification is suggested: 
The observed geometric mean trough concentrations and geometric mean concentrations at 1.5 hours 
post-administration (representing a concentration around tmax) at steady state were 4.30 nmol/L 
and 12.6 nmol/L, respectively. 
In addition, it is acknowledged that a direct comparison of paediatric to adult plasma concentrations is 
of interest for the prescriber. The following addition is suggested: 
The observed geometric mean trough concentrations and geometric mean concentrations at 1.5 hours 
post-administration at steady state were 4.30 nmol/L and 12.6 nmol/L, respectively. Corresponding 
plasma concentrations in adult patients were 6.04 nmol/L and 15.1 nmol/L. (Reference: 
c40364167) 
The values were derived from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study 
investigating the efficacy and safety of linagliptin administered orally once daily over 12 weeks as add-
on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycaemic control despite metformin 
therapy as this study matched the DINAMO study design in terms of dose, PK sampling and 
background medication (1218−0006, U08-1056). 
Descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations of linagliptin at steady state after multiple oral 
administration of 5 mg linagliptin once daily at week 52 [1218−0091, c38245139] in 
children/adolescents and at week 4 [1218−0006, U08-1056] in adults are displayed in the following 
Table:

There were only 7 patients included in the analysis of plasma concentrations at 1.5 h post drug 
administration for adult patients. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the therapeutic dose of 5 mg 
linagliptin assessed in several single and multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers and patients were 
generally consistent across studies and between healthy volunteers and patients. The Cmax,ss value 
derived from a previously conducted population pharmacokinetic analysis was 13.6 nmol/L [U10-1864] 
and the Cmax,ss value in study 1218-0033, where the final commercial formulation was administered 
to healthy volunteers, was 12.9 nM [U10-1139]. This indicates that the cited plasma concentration is 
representative for adult patients with type 2 diabetes around tmax.

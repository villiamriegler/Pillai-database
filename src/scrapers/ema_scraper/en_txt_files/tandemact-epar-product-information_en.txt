CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tandemact is indicated as second line treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who 
show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated and who are already treated 
with a combination of pioglitazone and glimepiride. 
After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess 
adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate 
response, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, 
prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained 
(see section 4.4). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Tandemact is one tablet taken once daily.  
If patients report hypoglycaemia, the dose of Tandemact should be reduced or free combination 
therapy should be considered.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If patients are receiving pioglitazone in combination with a sulphonylurea other than glimepiride, 
patients should be stabilised with concomitant pioglitazone and glimepiride before switching to 
Tandemact. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
Physicians should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually, 
particularly when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and 
cardiac failure). 
Renal impairment 
Tandemact should not be used in patients with severe renal function disorders (creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min, see section 4.3). 
Hepatic impairment 
Tandemact should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tandemact in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
The tablets are taken orally shortly before or with the first main meal. The tablets should be swallowed 
with a glass of water. 
4.3  Contraindications

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
There is no clinical trial experience of other oral anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products added to 
treatment with Tandemact or concomitantly administered glimepiride and pioglitazone.  
Hypoglycaemia 
When meals are taken at irregular hours or skipped altogether, treatment with Tandemact may lead to 
hypoglycaemia due to the sulphonylurea component. Symptoms can almost always be promptly 
controlled by immediate intake of carbohydrates (sugar). Artificial sweeteners have no effect. 
It is known from other sulphonylureas that, despite initially successful countermeasures, 
hypoglycaemia may recur. Severe hypoglycaemia or prolonged hypoglycaemia, only temporarily 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled by the usual amounts of sugar, require immediate medical treatment and occasionally 
hospitalisation. 
Treatment with Tandemact requires regular monitoring of glycaemic control. 
Fluid retention and cardiac failure 
Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When 
treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure 
(e.g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease or the elderly), physicians 
should start with the lowest available dose of pioglitazone and increase the dose gradually. Patients 
should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema; particularly those 
with reduced cardiac reserve. There have been post-marketing cases of cardiac failure reported when 
pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Since 
insulin and pioglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may 
increase the risk of oedema. Post marketing cases of peripheral oedema and cardiac failure have also 
been reported in patients with concomitant use of pioglitazone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Tandemact should be discontinued if any deterioration in 
cardiac state occurs. 
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease. Pioglitazone or placebo was 
added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years. This study showed an 
increase in reports of heart failure; however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.  
Elderly 
Combination use with insulin should be considered with caution in the elderly because of increased 
risk of serious heart failure. 
In light of age-related risks (especially bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure), the balance of 
benefits and risks should be considered carefully both before and during treatment in the elderly. 
Bladder cancer 
Cases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials 
with pioglitazone (19 cases from 12,506 patients, 0.15%) than in control groups (7 cases from 
10,212 patients, 0.07%) HR=2.64 (95% CI 1.11-6.31, p=0.029). After excluding patients in whom 
exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 
7 cases (0.06%) on pioglitazone and 2 cases (0.02%) in control groups. Epidemiological studies have 
also suggested a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone, 
although not all studies identified a statistically significant increased risk. 
Risk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks 
include age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents 
e.g. cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region). Any macroscopic haematuria 
should be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy.  
Patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if macroscopic haematuria 
or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment.

Liver function 
There have been rare reports of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction during 
post-marketing experience with pioglitazone and glimepiride (see section 4.8). Although in very rare 
cases fatal outcome has been reported, causal relationship has not been established. 
It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with Tandemact undergo periodic monitoring of 
liver enzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with Tandemact in 
all patients. Therapy with Tandemact should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver 
enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 x upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease.  
Following initiation of therapy with Tandemact, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored 
periodically based on clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 x upper limit of normal 
during Tandemact therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels 
remain > 3 x the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops 
symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision 
whether to continue the patient on therapy with Tandemact should be guided by clinical judgement 
pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, the medicinal product should be discontinued. 
Weight gain 
In clinical trials with pioglitazone and sulphonylurea monotherapy or in combination there was 
evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases 
associated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure 
therefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control. 
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet. 
Haematology 
Rare changes in haematology have been observed with glimepiride treatment (see section 4.8). 
Treatment with Tandemact therefore requires regular haematological monitoring (especially 
leucocytes and platelets). 
During therapy with pioglitazone there was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative 
reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% relative reduction), consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes 
were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6-4.1% relative reductions) and to a 
lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1-2% and haematocrit 1-3.2% relative 
reductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. 
Treatment of patients with G6PD-deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to haemolytic anaemia. 
Since glimepiride belongs to the chemical class of sulfonylurea medicinal products, caution should be 
used in patients with G6PD-deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. 
Eye disorders 
Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual 
acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients 
reported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association 
between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular 
oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should 
be considered. 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome 
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic 
ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if 
pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). 
Others 
An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse reactions 
reports of bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials (see section 4.8). 
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with 
pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator. The observed 
excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 
100 patient years of use. 
Some epidemiological studies have suggested a similarly increased risk of fracture in both men and 
women. 
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with pioglitazone 
(see section 4.8). 
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 
inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored 
closely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic 
treatment should be considered (see section 4.5). 
The tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare 
hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose 
malabsorption. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
There have been no formal interaction studies for Tandemact, however, the concomitant use of the 
active substances in patients in clinical use has not resulted in any unexpected interactions. The 
following statements reflect the information available on the individual active substances (pioglitazone 
and glimepiride). 
Pioglitazone 
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported 
to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. A decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be 
needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control 
should be considered (see section 4.4). Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer 
of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The 
pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close 
monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). 
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics 
or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Co-administration of 
pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea. 
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/9 and 3A4. 
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450. Interactions with 
substances metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel 
blockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glimepiride 
If glimepiride is taken simultaneously with certain other medicinal products, both undesired increases 
and decreases in the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride can occur. For this reason, other medicinal 
products should only be taken with Tandemact with the knowledge (or at the prescription) of the 
doctor. 
Based on the experience with glimepiride and with other sulphonylureas the following interactions 
have to be mentioned. 
Potentiation of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus, in some instances hypoglycaemia may 
occur when one of the following active substances is taken, for example: 
phenylbutazone, azapropazone and oxyfenbutazone 
insulin and oral antidiabetic products 
metformin 
salicylates and p-amino-salicylic acid 
anabolic steroids and male sex hormones 
chloramphenicol 
clarithromycin 
coumarin anticoagulants 
disopyramide 
fenfluramine 
fibrates 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
fluoxetine 
allopurinol 
sympatholytics 
cyclo-, tro- and iphosphamides 
sulphinpyrazone 
certain long-acting sulphonamides 
tetracyclines 
MAO-inhibitors 
quinolone antibiotics 
probenecid 
miconazole 
pentoxyfylline (high dose parenteral) 
tritoqualine 
fluconazole 
Weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus raised blood glucose levels may occur when 
one of the following active substances is taken, for example: 
oestrogens and progestagens, 
saluretics, thiazide diuretics, 
thyroid stimulating agents, glucocorticoids, 
phenothiazine derivatives, chlorpromazine, 
adrenaline and sympathicomimetics, 
nicotinic acid (high doses) and nicotinic acid derivatives, 
laxatives (long-term use), 
phenytoin, diazoxide, 
glucagon, barbiturates and rifampicin. 
acetozolamide 
H2 antagonists, betablockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of 
the blood glucose lowering effect. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Under the influence of sympatholytic active substances such as betablockers, clonidine, guanethidine 
and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counterregulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent. 
Alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride in an unpredictable 
fashion. 
Glimepiride may either potentiate or weaken the effects of coumarin derivatives. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Tandemact is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If a 
patient wishes to become pregnant, treatment with Tandemact should be discontinued. 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to pioglitazone 
There are no adequate data from the use of pioglitazone in pregnant women. Studies of pioglitazone in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  
Risk related to glimepiride 
There are no adequate data from the use of glimepiride in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown reproductive toxicity which was most likely related to the pharmacological action 
(hypoglycaemia) of glimepiride.  
Tandemact is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). If a pregnancy occurs, treatment 
with Tandemact should be discontinued. 
Breast-feeding 
Sulphonylurea-derivatives like glimepiride pass into the breast milk. Pioglitazone has been shown to 
be present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk.  
Tandemact is contra-indicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
In animal fertility studies with pioglitazone, there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or 
fertility index. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tandemact has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The patient’s ability to 
concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia from 
glimepiride or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations 
where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warnings of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
Patients who experience visual disturbance should be cautious when driving or using machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Clinical trials have been conducted with co-administered pioglitazone and glimepiride (see 
section 5.1). Hypoglycaemic reactions mostly occur immediately due to the sulphonylurea component 
of Tandemact. Symptoms can almost always be promptly controlled by immediate intake of 
carbohydrates (sugar). This is a serious reaction which may occur uncommonly (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) 
(see section 4.4). Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, erythrocytopenia, 
granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia and pancytopenia may occur rarely 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) (see section 4.4). Other reactions such as bone fracture, weight increase and 
oedema may occur commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in double-blind studies and post marketing experience are listed below as 
MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as: 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing incidence 
followed by decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
1 Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, erythrocytopenia, granulocytopenia, 
agranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia and pancyto-penia may occur. These are in general reversible 
upon discontinuation of treatment. 
2 In very rare cases mild hypersensitivity reactions may develop into serious reactions with dyspnoea, 
fall in blood pressure and sometimes shock. Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin may occur as 
itching, rash, and urticaria. Cross allergenicity with sulphonylureas, sulphonamides or related 
substances is possible. 
3 Postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with pioglitazone have been 
reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria.  
4 Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood 
glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other 
hypoglycaemic medicinal products. 
5 Gastro-intestinal complaints are very rare and seldom lead to discontinuation of therapy. 
6 Elevation of liver enzymes may occur. In very rare cases, impairment of liver function (e.g. with 
cholestasis and jaundice) may develop, as well as hepatitis which may progress to liver failure. 
7 A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised, 
comparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8,100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated 
groups and 7,400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration. A higher rate of 
fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%). No increase in 
fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of 
pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 
100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator. The observed excess risk of fractures for 
women on pioglitazone in this study is therefore 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years of use. No increase 
in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). 
Post-marketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4). 
8 Oedema was reported in 6-9% of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled 
clinical trials. The oedema rates for comparator groups (sulphonylurea, metformin) were 2-5%. The 
reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of 
treatment. 
9 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy 
was 2 – 3 kg over one year. This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group. In 
combination trials pioglitazone added to a sulphonylurea resulted in a mean weight increase over one 
year of 2.8 kg.  
10 In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the 
upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea 
comparator groups. Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone.  
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the 
same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used in 
combination therapy with insulin. In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major 
macrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than 
with placebo, when added to therapy that included in insulin. However, this did not lead to an increase 
in mortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher 
percentage of patients with heart failure was observed in patients aged ≥ 65 years compared with those 
less than 65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the incidence 
of heart failure was 8.2% in those ≥ 65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than 65 years. Heart 
failure has been reported with marketing use of pioglitazone, and more frequently when pioglitazone 
was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies, patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 
45 mg daily. The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/day for four days, then 180 mg/day for seven 
days was not associated with any symptoms. 
After ingestion of an overdose of glimepiride, hypoglycaemia may occur, lasting from 12 to 72 hours, 
and may recur after initial recovery. Symptoms may not be present for up to 24 hours after ingestion. 
In general observation in hospital is recommended. Nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain may occur. 
The hypoglycaemia may in general be accompanied by neurological symptoms like restlessness, 
tremor, visual disturbances, coordination problems, sleepiness, coma and convulsions. 
Treatment of overdose of Tandemact primarily consists of preventing absorption of glimepiride by 
inducing vomiting and then drinking water or lemonade with activated charcoal (adsorbent) and 
sodium-sulphate (laxative). If large quantities have been ingested, gastric lavage is indicated, followed 
by activated charcoal and sodium-sulphate. In case of (severe) overdose hospitalisation in an intensive 
care department is indicated. Start the administration of glucose as soon as possible, if necessary by a 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bolus intravenous injection of 50 ml of a 50% solution, followed by an infusion of a 10% solution with 
strict monitoring of blood glucose. Further treatment should be symptomatic. 
In particular when treating hypoglycaemia due to accidental intake of Tandemact in infants and young 
children, the dose of glucose given must be carefully controlled to avoid the possibility of producing 
dangerous hyperglycaemia. Blood glucose should be closely monitored.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering 
drugs; ATC code: A10BD06. 
Tandemact combines two antihyperglycaemic active substances with complementary mechanisms of 
action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pioglitazone, a member 
of the thiazolidinedione class and glimepiride, a member of the sulphonylurea class. 
Thiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and sulphonylureas primarily by 
inducing insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. 
Pioglitazone 
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone appears to act 
via activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading 
to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals. Treatment with 
pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose 
disposal in the case of insulin resistance. 
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma 
insulin concentrations. A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to 
two years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the 
first six months of therapy). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients 
treated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone. At two years, glycaemic control (defined as 
HbA1c < 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of 
patients on gliclazide. In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with 
gliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in 
HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year. The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during 
the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide. 
In a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin 
optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months. Patients receiving 
pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin 
alone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group. 
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin 
sensitivity. Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect. 
In one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the 
albumin/creatinine ratio compared to baseline. 
The effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in 
type 2 diabetics. Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain. Visceral fat was 
significantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass. Similar changes in 
body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. 
In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically 
significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels. In clinical trials of up to two years duration, 
pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-cholesterol 
levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide. Pioglitazone did not cause statistically 
significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions were 
observed with metformin and gliclazide. In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, 
pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and 
hepatically synthesised triglycerides. These effects were independent of pioglitazone’s effects on 
glycaemia and were statistically significantly different to glibenclamide. 
In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to 
existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years. The study population had an 
average age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Approximately one third of 
patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea. To be eligible 
patients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous 
cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, 
or peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial 
infarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke. Approximately half of the study population had at 
least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria. Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving 
cardiovascular medicinal products (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium 
channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, acetylsalicylic acid, statins, fibrates). 
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause 
mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, 
coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term 
cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone. However, the incidence of oedema, weight gain 
and heart failure were increased. No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed. 
Glimepiride 
Glimepiride acts mainly by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. 
As with other sulphonylureas this effect is based on an increase of responsiveness of the pancreatic 
beta cells to the physiological glucose stimulus. In addition, glimepiride seems to have pronounced 
extrapancreatic effects also postulated for other sulphonylureas. 
Insulin release 
Sulphonylureas regulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the beta 
cell membrane. Closing the potassium channel induces depolarisation of the beta cell and results – by 
opening of calcium channels – in an increased influx of calcium into the cell. This leads to insulin 
release through exocytosis. Glimepiride binds with a high exchange rate to a beta cell membrane 
protein which is associated with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel but which is different from the 
usual sulphonylurea binding site. 
Extrapancreatic activity 
The extrapancreatic effects are for example an improvement of the sensitivity of the peripheral tissue 
for insulin and a decrease of the insulin uptake by the liver.  
The uptake of glucose from blood into peripheral muscle and fat tissues occurs via a special transport 
proteins, located in the cells membrane. The transport of glucose in these tissues is the rate limiting 
step in the use of glucose. Glimepiride increases very rapidly the number of active glucose transport 
molecules in the plasma membranes of muscle and fat cells, resulting in stimulated glucose uptake. 
Glimepiride increases the activity of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C which 
may be correlated with the induced lipogenesis and glycogenesis in isolated fat and muscle cells.  
Glimepiride inhibits the glucose production in the liver by increasing the intracellular concentration of 
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which in turn inhibits the gluconeogenesis. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
General 
In healthy persons, the minimum effective oral dose is approximately 0.6 mg. The effect of 
glimepiride is dose-dependent and reproducible. The physiological response to acute physical 
exercise, reduction of insulin secretion, is still present under glimepiride. 
There was no significant difference in effect regardless of whether glimepiride was given 30 minutes 
or immediately before a meal. In diabetic patients, good metabolic control over 24 hours can be 
achieved with a single daily dose. 
Although the hydroxy metabolite of glimepiride caused a small but significant decrease in serum 
glucose in healthy persons, it accounts for only a minor part of the total effect. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tandemact in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus. See section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Tandemact  
Studies in human volunteers have shown Tandemact to be bioequivalent to the administration of 
pioglitazone and glimepiride given as separate tablets.  
The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of 
Tandemact. 
Pioglitazone 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of 
unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration. Proportional increases of 
the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2-60 mg. Steady state is achieved after 
4-7 days of dosing. Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites. 
Absorption is not influenced by food intake. Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%. 
Distribution 
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 L/kg. 
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%). 
Biotransformation 
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. 
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser 
degree. Three of the six identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, and M-IV). When activity, 
concentrations and protein binding are taken into account, pioglitazone and metabolite M-III 
contribute equally to efficacy. On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold 
that of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal. 
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450. 
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A, 2C8/9, and 3A4 in man. 
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics 
or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Concomitant 
administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the 
plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in 
faeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%). In animals, only a small amount of unchanged 
pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces. The mean plasma elimination half-life of 
unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Single dose studies demonstrate linearity of pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. 
Elderly 
Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects. 
Patients with renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower 
than those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is 
similar. Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged, but with an increased volume of distribution. 
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced, coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone. 
Glimepiride 
Absorption 
The bioavailability of glimepiride after oral administration is complete. Food intake has no relevant 
influence on absorption, only absorption rate is slightly diminished. Maximum serum concentrations 
(Cmax) are reached approximately 2.5 hours after oral intake (mean 0.3 µg/mL during multiple dosing 
of 4 mg daily).  
Distribution 
Glimepiride has a very low distribution volume (approximately 8.8 litres) which is roughly equal to 
the albumin distribution space, high protein binding (> 99%), and a low clearance (approximately 
48 mL/min).  
In animals, glimepiride is excreted in milk. Glimepiride is transferred to the placenta. Passage of the 
blood brain barrier is low. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Mean dominant serum half-life, which is of relevance for the serum concentrations under 
multiple-dose conditions, is about 5 to 8 hours. After high doses, slightly longer half-lives were noted. 
After a single dose of radiolabelled glimepiride, 58% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine, 
and 35% in the faeces. No unchanged substance was detected in the urine. Two metabolites – most 
probably resulting from hepatic metabolism (major enzyme is CYP2C9) – were identified both in 
urine and faeces: the hydroxy derivative and the carboxy derivative. After oral administration of 
glimepiride, the terminal half-lives of those metabolites were 3 to 6 and 5 to 6 hours respectively. 
Comparison of single and multiple once-daily dosing revealed no significant differences in 
pharmacokinetics, and the intra-individual variability was very low. There was no relevant 
accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetics were similar in males and females, as well as in young and elderly (above 65 years) 
patients. In patients with low creatinine clearance, there was a tendency for glimepiride clearance to 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase and for average serum concentrations to decrease, most probably resulting from a more rapid 
elimination because of lower protein binding. Renal elimination of the two metabolites was impaired. 
Overall no additional risk of accumulation is to be assumed in such patients. 
Pharmacokinetics in five non-diabetic patients after bile duct surgery were similar to those in healthy 
persons. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
There is a linear relationship between dose and both Cmax and AUC (area under the time/concentration 
curve).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products of Tandemact. The following data 
are findings in studies performed with pioglitazone or glimepiride individually. 
Pioglitazone 
In toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric 
cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
In addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed. These findings were observed 
across species at plasma concentrations ≤ 4 times the clinical exposure. Foetal growth restriction was 
apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in 
diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during 
pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.  
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro 
genotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) 
of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.  
The formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was 
postulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A 
24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in 
an increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly 
decreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated the 
hyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. The 
relevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.  
There was no tumourigenic response in mice of either sex. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not 
seen in dogs or monkeys treated with pioglitazone for up to 12 months. 
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other 
thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is 
unknown. 
Glimepiride 
Preclinical effects observed occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of the maximum human 
exposure as to indicate little relevance to clinical use, or were due to the pharmacodynamic action 
(hypoglycaemia) of the compound. This finding is based on conventional safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproduction toxicity studies. In the latter 
(covering embryotoxicity, teratogenicity and developmental toxicity), undesirable effects observed 
were considered to be secondary to the hypoglycaemic effects induced by the compound in dams and 
in offspring.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tandemact is and what it is used for  
Tandemact contains pioglitazone and glimepiride which are anti-diabetic medicines, used to control 
blood sugar level.  
It is used in adults when metformin is not suitable to treat type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes 
mellitus. This type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood where the body either does not produce 
enough insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels), or cannot effectively use the insulin it 
produces. 
Tandemact helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by increasing 
the amount of insulin available and helping your body make better use of it. Your doctor will check 
whether Tandemact is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tandemact (see also section 4) 
- 
if you have a problem with your heart. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin 
together experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if 
you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in 
weight or localised swelling (oedema).  
if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over 
75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and 
swelling, you must also tell your doctor. 
if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye), talk to your doctor if you notice any change to your vision.  
if you have a problem with your liver. Before you start taking Tandemact you will have a blood 
sample taken to check your liver function. This check should be repeated at intervals. Inform 
your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms suggesting a problem with your liver 
(like feeling sick without explanations, vomiting, stomach ache, tiredness, loss of appetite 
and/or dark urine) as your liver function should be checked.  
if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Tandemact. If 
this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned 
pregnancy. 
if you are already taking other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. 
if you have problems with your enzyme called Glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase since it can 
decrease your red cells. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
You may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). Your doctor may take blood tests to 
monitor your blood cell levels and liver function. 
Hypoglycaemia 
When you take Tandemact, your blood sugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). If 
you experience symptoms of hypoglycaemia such as cold sweat, tiredness, headache, rapid heartbeat, 
hunger pangs, irritability, nervousness or nausea, you should take some sugar to increase your blood 
sugar level again. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information if you are not sure how to 
recognise this. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit 
juice. 
Broken bones 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. 
Children and adolescents 
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. 
Other medicines and Tandemact 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because some medicines can weaken or strengthen the effect of Tandemact on the 
level of sugar in your blood. 
The following medicines can increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact. This can lead to 
a risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar):  
- 
- 
- 
gemfibrozil and fibrates (to lower high cholesterol level) 
insulin, metformin or other medicines to treat diabetes mellitus  
phenylbutazone, azapropazone, oxyphenbutazone, aspirin-like medicines (to treat pain and 
inflammation) 
long acting sulphonamides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, fluconazole, miconazole, 
quinolones, clarithromycin (to treat bacterial or fungal infections)

The following medicines can increase or decrease the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact: 
- 
- 
H2 antagonists (to treat stomach ulcers) 
beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine (to treat high blood pressure or heart 
failure). These can also hide the signs of hypoglycaemia, so special care is needed when taking 
these medicines  
Tandemact may either increase or weaken the effects of the following medicines:  
coumarin derivatives such as warfarin (to slow down or stop blood clotting)  
- 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and 
your dose of Tandemact may need to be changed. 
Tandemact with alcohol 
Avoid alcohol while taking Tandemact since alcohol may increase or decrease the blood sugar 
lowering action of Tandemact in an unpredictable way.

Tandemact”). 
Driving and using machines 
Alertness and reaction time may be impaired due to low or high blood sugar due to glimepiride, 
especially when beginning or after altering treatment, or when Tandemact is not taken regularly. This 
may affect your ability to drive or use machines.  
Take care if you experience abnormal vision.

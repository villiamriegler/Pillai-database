1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC in

SmPC 
SmPC new text 
order to update recommendations for patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment following 
final results from study 20200362 listed as a 
category 3 PASS study in the EU RMP; this is a Phase 
I clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of a single oral dose of sotorasib administered in 
subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
compared with subjects who have normal hepatic 
function. The EU RMP version 1.3 has also been 
agreed. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.3. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Further to the results of study 20200362, it is concluded in 
section 4.2 and 4.4 that Lumykras is not recommended for 
use in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe 
(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment and that there is 
currently no data on the clinical safety and efficacy of 
multiple doses of sotorasib when administered to patients 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.  
Furthermore, it was clarified in section 5.2 that compared 
to subjects with normal hepatic function after a single oral 
dose is administered (960 mg), the mean systemic 
exposure AUCinf of Lumykras decreased by 25.4% in 
subjects with moderate impairment and increased by 3.6% 
in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. The unbound 
AUCinf  of Lumykras increased by 1.8-fold in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment and by 6-fold in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.

SmPC and PL 
Further to the results of a drug-drug interaction study, the 
to update information regarding the co-
administration of sotorasib with acid reducing 
agents, based on the results from study 20220024; 
this is a phase 1, single-center, open-label drug-drug 
interaction study to evaluate the impact of 
omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, on the 
pharmacokinetics of sotorasib co-administered with 
an acidic beverage in healthy volunteers. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, 
recommendations on co-administering sotorasib with acid-
reducing agents, such as PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists, 
in the SmPC (sections 4.2 and 4.5) have changed. 
Under fasted conditions, co administration of repeat doses 
of omeprazole with a single dose of 960 mg sotorasib and 
240 mL of an acidic beverage (non-diet cola) decreased 
sotorasib Cmax by 32% and AUC by 23%. The clinical 
relevance of the decreased sotorasib exposure when co-
administered with omeprazole and cola is unclear and

efficacy might be reduced. 
If co-administration of LUMYKRAS with an acid-reducing 
agent (such as a PPI or an H2 receptor antagonist) is 
required, LUMYKRAS should be taken with an acidic 
beverage (such as cola). Alternatively, LUMYKRAS should 
be taken 4 hours before or 10 hours after administration of 
a local antacid.

Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC based on the 
15/09/2022 
21/11/2022 
SmPC and PL 
Further to the results of study 20200426, it is concluded 
results  of Study 2020042, a phase 1 clinical drug 
interaction study undertaken to assess the effect of 
concomitant sotorasib administration on the systemic 
exposure of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
transporter substrates. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in 
the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
that Lumykras is a weak BCRP inhibitor. Co-administration 
of Lumykras with a BCRP substrate led to an increase in the 
plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate, which may 
increase the effect of the substrate. Co-administration of 
Lumykras with rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) increased 
the rosuvastatin Cmax by 70% and AUC by 34%. When 
Lumykras is co-administered with a BCRP substrate, 
including but not limited to lapatinib, methotrexate, 
mitoxantrone, rosuvastatin and topotecan, patients should 
be monitored for adverse reactions of the BCRP substrate 
and reduce the BCRP substrate dose in accordance with its 
current summary of product characteristics.

Product Characteristics.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC based on results 
15/09/2022 
21/11/2022 
SmPC and PL 
The SmPC section 4.2 has been updated as follows:  
from the enteral feeding tube in vitro study (RPT-
574024), undertaken to assess the feasibility of 
administration of sotorasib 120 mg film-coated 
tablets through an enteral feeding tube. The Package 
Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
In patients who have difficulty swallowing solids and if 
administration through a nasogastric (NG) tube or 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is 
required, patients should disperse the 120 mg tablets. The 
dispersed suspension and rinse should be administered as 
per the NG or PEG tube manufacturer’s instructions with 
appropriate water flushes within 2 hours of preparation, 
stored at room temperature. 
The PL has been updated accordingly

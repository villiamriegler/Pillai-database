2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tigecycline  is  a  semisynthetic  derivative  of  minocycline  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  antibacterial  activity, 
including inhibition of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic bacteria. It is active against 
multidrug-resistant  (MDR)  Gram-positive  and  Gram-negative  bacteria,  including  methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA),  penicillin-resistant  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  (PRSP),  vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus species (VRE), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia 
coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae (Proteus species and related 
organisms) are notable exceptions to the broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline. In addition, some species 
such as Bacteroides fragilis and Acinetobacter baumannii show a wide distribution of their susceptibility to 
tigecycline.

Tygacil  is  indicated  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue  infections  (cSSTI), 
excluding  diabetic  foot  infections,  and  for  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  (cIAI).  Tygacil  was 
approved  for  these  indications  in  the  EU  on  24  April  2006.  After  the  last  renewal  in  February  2011 
(EMA/CHMP/100477/2011),  the  indications  were  restricted  and Tygacil  was  approved to be  used  only in 
situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives are not suitable. 
The MAH is submitting an extension of indication for the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 
years to <18 years of age. The proposed indications for tigecycline in children are the same as those for 
adults. Similarly to adults, the labelling will specify that tigecycline is only to be used in children only in 
situations where other alternatives are not suitable.  
The  use  of  tigecycline  in  children  younger  than  8  years  old  may  be  associated  with  permanent  tooth 
discolouration  if  used  during  tooth  development.  A  waiver  was  granted  by  the  Paediatric  Committee  in 
children <8 years of age in December 2008. In the frame of modification 04 (M04) of the initially agreed 
PIP  (EMEA-000120-PIP01-07),  the  MAH  requested  that  the  paediatric  PIP  safety  and  efficacy  phase  3 
studies in children aged 8 years to less than 18 years with complicated skin and soft tissue infections and 
with  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  should  not  be  conducted,  due  to  the  safety  concerns 
identified in  adults.  In  addition,  the  MAH  anticipated  that  some  changes  will need  to  be implemented  in 
the SmPC, but none of them would allow the inclusion of dosing recommendations in section 4.2, as there 
was no paediatric indication in section 4.1.  
However, as tigecycline may constitute the only alternative for children with infections produced by multi-
resistant (mainly Gram-negative) microorganisms, the MAH proposed this extension of indication in which 
the  CHMP  should  assess  whether,  based  on  the  current  available  data,  a  very  restricted  (last  line) 
indication in children can be granted, accompanied by the inclusion of dosing recommendations and of all 
necessary cautionary warnings in the SmPC. Currently, the approved Tygacil SmPC reflects paediatric PK 
data from studies 110 and 2207 (see section on pharmacokinetics in this report), but in section 4.2 it is 
stated  that a recommendations on a posology cannot be made. The PIP modification 04 was withdrawn 
and the MAH submitted a further modification on an agreed PIP (M05) proposing a last line indication for 
the approved adult indications in children aged 8 years and older. 
According  to  the  “Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for 
treatment  of  bacterial  infections”  (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013),  limited  evidence  of  clinical  safety  and 
efficacy  could  be  accepted  to  support  an  initial  approval  for  the  treatment  of  infections  caused  by 
multidrug-resistant  (MDR)  organisms  for  which  there  are  few  therapeutic  options.  Assuming  that  the 
PK/PD  analyses  strongly  support  an  expectation  of  clinical  efficacy  against  problematic  MDR  pathogens, 
the  clinical  programme  should  take  into  account  the  properties  of  the  test  antibacterial  agent  (e.g. 
spectrum of activity) and the unmet need it may be able to address.  
As  a  consequence,  this  report  addresses  whether  the  current  data  allow  granting  such  a  restricted 
indication.  Within M05 it was also agreed with the PDCO that the safety and efficacy studies previously 
mentioned would not be performed, as it was highly unlikely that enrolment in these studies was feasible 
due  to  the  safety  concerns  identified  in  adult  patients  that  had  already  resulted  in  the  reassessment  of 
the benefit-risk of Tygacil and in the restriction of the adult indication.  
The  proposed  indications  for  tigecycline  in  children,  and  the  proposed  labelling  language  (Summary  of 
Product Characteristics, Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications) are as follows: 
“Tygacil  is  indicated  in  adults  and  in  children  eight  years  and  older  for  the  treatment  of  the  following 
infections: 
•  Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 7/35 
 
  
  
Tygacil should be used in adults only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives 
are not suitable. 
Due  to  limited  safety  and  efficacy  data  in  children,  Tygacil  is  only  to  be  used  in  children  when  no 
alternative antibacterial drugs are available. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.”   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 "Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use", an evaluation of the environmental impact should be 
made  if  there  is  an  increase  in  the  environmental  exposure.  CHMP  agreed  that  the  additional  use  of 
tigecycline  in  a  hospital  based  setting,  within  the  small  patient  population  of  paediatric  patients  from  8 
years  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  when  no  alternative  antibacterial  drugs  are  suitable  and  after 
consultation  with  a  physician  with  appropriate  experience  in  the  management  of  infectious  diseases  is 
expected  to  be  insignificant.  An  environmental  risk  assessment  is  not  considered  necessary  in  this 
application. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in 
environmental exposure further to the use of tigecycline. CHMP agreed that tigecycline is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric  population  has  been  evaluated  in  2  paediatric 
studies: an ascending single-dose study in subjects 8 to 16 years of age recovering from infections (study 
110),  and  a  multiple-dose  study  in  patients  8  to  11  years  with  cSSTI,  cIAI,  or  community-acquired 
pneumonia (study 2207).  No loading dose was administered in these paediatric PK studies.

Two  approaches  were  used  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline:  an  individual  non-
compartmental analysis, and a population pharmacokinetic approach. 
Standard  non-compartmental  analysis  methods  were  used  to  determine  individually  the  following 
parameters:  Cmax,  tmax,  AUC,  t1/2,  CL,  V,  Clss  and  Vss.  Weight-normalized  clearance  (CLW)  and 
weight-normalized volume of distribution (VssW) were also calculated for study 2207 as the ratio of the 
parameter/weight.  
PK parameters were calculated for all participants in study 110 and for all but 7 in study 2207.  
The calculated individual parameters for study 110 are listed in the following table: 
Table 1: Single-Dose Tigecycline Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Healthy Children (Mean±SD) 
The calculated individual parameters for study 2207 are listed in the following table: 
Table 2: Steady-State Tigecycline Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Pediatric Subjects aged 8 to 
11 yearsa (Excluding Redacted Data) 
The  estimated  PK  parameters  when  data  were  individually  analysed  by  non-compartmental  methods  in 
study 2207 showed that the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in the paediatric population differs from that 
in adults.  
The mean Vss (3.6 and 2.84 L/kg for the 1 mg/kg and 1.25 mg/kg dosing groups, respectively) was half 
the  value  observed  in  adults  (7.9  L/kg).  Conversely,  weight  adjusted  plasma  clearance  (0.50  and  0.52 
L/h/kg  for  the  1  mg/kg  and  1.25  mg/kg  dosing  groups,  respectively)  was  higher  than  in  adults  (0.31 
L/h/kg). These results translated in higher Cmax in children (1.5 and 2.6 mg/L for the 1 mg/kg and 1.25 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015

mg/kg dosing groups, respectively) than in adults (1.45 mg/L) but in lower AUC values for children (2.5 
and  3.1  mg/L/h  for  the  1  mg/kg  or  1.25  mg/kg  doses  respectively)  than  in  adults  (5.19  mg/L/h  for 
adults).   
In  study  110,  several  children  had  very  high  Cmax  values  (up  to  90  mg/L,  30  minutes  after  the 
administration of the dose). In study 2207 the maximum Cmax value seen was 12.9 mg/L in the highest 
dosing group. Such high values had not been seen in adult studies.  
A  population  pharmacokinetic  model  was  developed  using  pooled  PK  data  from  the  two  PK  paediatric 
studies.  The  data  were  best  described  by  a  two  compartmental  model  with  first-order  elimination  from 
the central compartment. Body weight was found to be a covariate of tigecycline plasma clearance. The 
interindividual  variability  was  high.  The  estimated  parameters  describing  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
tigecycline in children are listed in the following table: 
Table 3: Parameter Estimates and Associated Standard Errors for Final Pharmacokinetic Model 
The  residual  error  was  estimated  to  be  43.3%  which  may  have  had  an  impact  on  model-based 
simulations.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response  analyses  of  tigecycline  in  adults  with  cSSTI  and  cIAI  previously  determined  that 
AUC/MIC  ratios  of  17.9  and  6.96  were  most  predictive  of  therapeutic  efficacy  in  cSSTI  and  cIAI, 
respectively. Thus, these ratios were selected for target attainment in simulations that compared various 
paediatric doses of tigecycline with the approved adult dose of 50 mg IV q12h. 
Two approaches were used to simulate AUC0-24 and MIC values for comparison of target attainment and 
dose selection: 
•  Monte  Carlo  simulations  using  individual  clearance  values  determined  from  non-compartmental 
analysis of the PK data from children aged 8 to 11 (data from study 3074K4-2207-WW) and from 
adults (phase 2 and 3 studies); and 
•  Nonlinear  mixed  effects  (NLME)  model-based  simulations  using  the  paediatric  population  PK 
model for children ages 8 to <18 years and the population PK model for adults. 
Both  approaches  used  a  range  of  weight-based  doses  in  children  from  0.75  to  1.25  mg/kg  q12h  to  a 
maximum  dose  of  50  mg  q12h.  In  addition,  a  50  mg  q12h  dose  was  simulated  in  children  12  to  <18 
years of age. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 10/35 
 
  
  
 
 
The results of Monte Carlo simulations are presented in the following table: 
Table 4: Percentage of Patients Attaining the Target AUC/MIC Ratios Based on Monte Carlo 
Simulations 
A  tigecycline  regimen  of  1.2  mg/kg  q12h,  with  a  maximum  dose  of  50  mg,  is  predicted  to  achieve  the 
target AUC/MIC ratio in a percentage of paediatric patients similar to the percentage of adults receiving 
50 mg q12h. 
Since the Monte Carlo simulations were performed using clearance values from younger children (8 to 11 
years),  model-based  simulations  were  carried  out  to  confirm  the  suitability  of  extrapolating  the  dosing 
based on Monte Carlo simulations to children 12 to <18 years of age.  Target attainment for the model-
based  simulations  using  the  paediatric  population  PK  model  for  children  ages  8  to  <18  years  and  the 
adult population PK model is presented in the following table: 
Table 5: Percentage of Patients Attaining the Target AUC/MIC Ratios Based on Nonlinear 
Mixed Effects Model-Based Simulations 
For children 8 to <12 years of age, doses of ≥1.0 mg/kg q12h were predicted to attain target AUC/MIC 
values  for  both  indications  in  a  percentage  of  paediatric  patients  similar  to  adults.  Although  all  of  the 
simulated  doses  for  the  12  to  <18  year  olds  attained  target  in  a  percentage  of  patients  comparable  to 
adults, a plateau seemed to be reached at doses greater than 1.0 mg/kg q12h. This is consistent with a 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 11/35 
 
  
  
 
 
higher  percentage  of  patients  in  this  age  group  reaching  the  maximum  dose  of  50  mg  q12h  based  on 
body weight at doses >1.0 mg/kg q12h.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The approved dose regimen for adults with cSSTI or cIAI is an initial loading dose of 100 mg followed by 
50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. The AUC0-24h observed in adults is approximately 5.0 mg•h/L; 
thus,  for  AUC  0-12h,  the  target  would  be  2.5  mg•h/L.  Dose  reduction  is  considered  necessary  only  for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), who receive 25 mg every 12 hours following the 
100 mg loading dose.  
No loading dose was administered in the above paediatric PK studies. The MAH’s reasoning proposal was 
found  acceptable  by  CHMP,  in  particular  taking  into  account  the  tolerability  issues  associated  to 
tigecycline administration.    
Two  approaches  have  been  used  to  describe  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline:  an  individual  non-
compartmental PK analysis and a population PK analysis.  
The  estimated  PK  parameters  when  data  were  individually  analysed  by  non-compartmental  methods  in 
study 2207 showed that the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in the paediatric population differs from that 
in adults. The volume of distribution in children is lower than that observed in adults, whereas clearance 
is higher.  These results translate in higher mean values of Cmax and smaller values of AUC for doses of 
1 mg/kg or 1.25 mg/kg.    
In  study  110,  several  children  had  very  high  Cmax  values  (up  to  90  mg/L,  30  minutes  after  the 
administration of the dose). In study 2207 the maximum Cmax value seen was 12.9 mg/L in the highest 
dosing group. As nausea and vomiting occur more frequently in the paediatric population and seem to be 
dose-dependent,  it  is  suggested  that  the  infusion  time  is  prolonged  to  60  minutes  in  the  paediatric 
patients. Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that Tygacil should be administered only by intravenous infusion 
over 30 to 60 minutes. CHMP agreed to recommend a length of infusion of 60 minutes for the paediatric 
population; the SmPC was updated accordingly.  
Regarding the population pharmacokinetic model, a two compartmental model with weight as a covariate 
of  clearance  best  described  the  data,  as  it  occurred  for  adults.  The  process  followed  during  the  model 
development  seems  reasonable  although  the  residual  error  of  the  model  was  high  (43.8%)  and  it  could 
have  an  impact  in  the  results  of  the  simulated  individual  concentrations  used  for  percent  of  target 
attainment (see below).  No issues were raised in this respect given that the non-compartmental analysis 
of  study  2207  followed  by  simulations  was  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  conclusions  of  the  model-
based analysis.  
The  effect  of  weight  on  clearance  is  sufficiently  high  as  to  suggest  that  tigecycline  should  be  dosed 
according to weight in children 8 to 16 years old. 
During the procedure, the MAH has clarified that no data was available on tigecycline pharmacokinetics in 
paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.  Despite the fact that weight-adjusted tigecycline clearance 
is  somewhat  higher  in  children  compared  to  adults,  CHMP  agreed  that  the  excretion  pathways  are 
predicted  to  be  affected  to  a  similar  extent  by  severe  hepatic  impairment  in  paediatric  patients.  
Therefore  CHMP  agreed  that,  as  in  adults,  a  50%  reduction  in  tigecycline  dose  should  be  considered  in 
children  and  adolescents  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  C).  The  SmPC  was  amended

Population PK-PD 
The  proposed  dosing  recommendations  for  tigecycline  in  children  aged  8  to  less  than  18  years  are  as 
follows: 
•  Children aged 8 to <12 years: 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours intravenously to a maximum dose of 50 mg 
of tigecycline every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. 
•  Adolescents aged 12 to <18 years: 50 mg of tigecycline every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. 
Two approaches were used to simulate AUC0-24  and MIC values for comparison of target attainment and 
dose selection: 
•  Monte  Carlo  simulations  using  individual  clearance  values  determined  from  non-compartmental 
analysis of the PK data from children aged 8 to 11 (data from study 2207) and from adults (phase 
2 and 3 studies); and 
•  Nonlinear  mixed  effects  (NLME)  model-based  simulations  using  the  paediatric  population  PK 
model for children ages 8 to <18 years and the population PK model for adults. 
Both  approaches  used  a  range  of  weight-based  doses  in  children  from  0.75  to  1.25  mg/kg  q12h  to  a 
maximum  dose  of  50  mg  q12h  (i.e.,  if  the  bodyweight  of  the  subject  met  or  exceeded  a  50  mg  dose 
based upon a mg/kg dose, the dose was set to 50 mg).  In addition, a 50 mg q12h dose was simulated in 
children 12 to <18 years of age. MIC distribution values obtained from the T.E.S.T. program during the 
time  period  from  2007  to  2009  have  been  used  for  simulations  of  percent  of  target  attainment.    Both 
approaches are discussed given that the first one (Monte Carlo simulation) was based on results of study 
2207 that enrolled only children in the age range from 8 to less than 12 years old while simulations were 
also  performed  for  the  older  age  range.  The  MAH  was  of  the  opinion  that  for  assessment  of  target 
attainment  of  different  dosing  strategies  in  children,  Monte  Carlo  simulation  performed  as  part  of  study 
2207 was reasonable. AUC is determined by clearance alone when dosing is defined, and because weight 
was  the  only  covariate  found  to  significantly  influence  clearance  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic 
analysis,  the  2207  Monte  Carlo  simulation  explored  the  same  weight-based  dosing  possibilities  as  a 
simulation based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  In both cases the maximum dose allowed 
was 50 mg every 12 hours. 
The distribution of body weights used for each dosing scenario in the Monte Carlo simulation was (mean 
±  SD)  34.8  ±  11.7  kg,  based  on  values  from  children  with  PK  in  study  2207.    The  weight  at  which  the 
dose reached the adult maximum of 50 mg was lower as the weight-based dosing level increased; e.g. a 
weight  of  67  kg  for  the  lowest  dose  simulated  (0.75  mg/kg)  and  40  kg  for  the  highest  dose  simulated 
(1.25  mg/kg).  The  distribution  of  clearance  values  used  in  the  simulation  was  (mean  ±  SD)  0.503  ± 
0.293  L/h/kg,  which  covered  the  range  estimated  by  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  10.04 
L/h for the 20 kg minimum weight (0.502 L/h/kg) to 17.49 L/h for the 120 kg maximum weight (0.146 
L/h/kg). 
In adult patients the following targets were identified: AUC0-24/MIC ratios of ≥ 17.9 for cSSTI and ≥ 6.96 
for cIAI. The percentage of adult patients expected to meet or exceed the target AUC(0-24h)/MIC ratios 
is 82.4% for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and 57.0% for complicated skin and soft tissue 
infections (cSSTI).  
The estimated percent of target attainment in paediatric patients based on the Monte-Carlo simulation are 
81.6% and 54.5% for cIAI and cSSTI, respectively for the proposed dose of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours. 
These figures for model-based simulation of the same dose are 86.5% and 62.0% for children aged 8 to 
less than 12 years. For children aged 12 to less than 18 years, the percent of target attainment according 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 13/35 
 
  
  
to model-based simulations for the proposed dose of 50 mg every 12 hours were 87.4% and 64.1% for 
cIAI and cSSTIs, respectively.  
Therefore,  pop-PK-PD  model-based  simulations  of  percent  of  target  attainment  lead to  higher  estimates 
of paediatric patients at or above the adult predefined target. It can be discussed whether the proposed 
dose of 1.2 mg/kg for children aged 8 to less than 12 years is appropriate or whether a lower dose such 
as 1 mg/kg may be more appropriate. In this respect the CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal, due to 
the fact that tigecycline is expected to be used in serious infections in children when no other alternatives 
are  suitable.  As  a  consequence,  it  was  agreed  that  a  higher  dose  will  maximize  efficacy.    In  addition, 
safety of tigecycline can be easily monitored in clinical practice. Second, because the residual error of the 
pop  PK  model  was  estimated  to  be  43.3%.  Such  a  high  value  may  have  an  impact  in  model-based 
predictions. 
In conclusion, CHMP agreed that the proposed dosing regimen of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 h for children 8 to 
<12 years old and 50 mg every 12h for children 12 to less than 18 years old seemed reasonable. CHMP 
also agreed that a 50% dose reduction was equally appropriate for both adult patients and children and 
adolescents with severe hepatic impairment.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
CHMP agreed with the proposed dosing regimen of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 h for children 8 to <12 years old 
and  50  mg  every  12h  for  children  12  to  less  than  18  years  old.  CHMP  also  agreed  that  a  50%  dose 
reduction was also appropriate for children and adolescents with severe hepatic impairment.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Tigecycline  has  not  been  fully  investigated in  the  paediatric  population  for  treatment  of  cSSTI  and  cIAI, 
pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  safety  data  are  available  from  2  studies  in  paediatric  subjects:  single-dose 
study  3074A1-110-US  (hereafter  referred  to  as  study  110)  and  multiple-dose  study  3074K4-2207-WW 
(hereafter  referred  to  as  study  2207),  and  limited  efficacy  data  are  available  from  the  latter.  These 
results,  together  with  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  modelling  are  used  for  extrapolating 
the efficacy of tigecycline from adults to support the approval in children 8 years of age and older for the 
treatment of cSSTI and cIAI. 
Support for the efficacy of tigecycline in paediatric patients is provided by: 
•  Data  for  clinical  response  from  Study  2207,  conducted  in  58  children  8-11  years  of  age  with 
cSSTI, cIAI, or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); 
• 
• 
Efficacy  outcomes  from  12  patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  who  received  tigecycline  on  a 
compassionate use basis. 
Information from the medical literature regarding efficacy outcomes in patients <18 years of age 
treated with tigecycline; and  
•  Microbiology  data  from  the  Tigecycline  Evaluation  and  Surveillance  Trial  (TEST):  A  summary  of 
the in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against pathogens isolated from children 8 to <18 
years of age globally and in the EU from January 2004 to October 2014.

2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Efficacy of Tigecycline in Paediatric Clinical Trials (Study 3074K4-2207-WW) 
This  was  a  phase  2,  multicentre,  open-label,  ascending  multiple-dose  study  to  determine  the  PK  profile 
and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending multiple doses of tigecycline in paediatric subjects 
aged  from  8  to  11  years  with  cIAI,  cSSSI,  or  CAP  requiring  hospitalisation  and  administration  of 
intravenous  (IV)  antibiotic  therapy.  It  is  part  of  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  agreed  with  the 
PDCO and  for which a positive opinion was issued by the EMA in May 2009 (date of last modification of 
the agreed PIP). 
Eligible  subjects  received  intravenous  (IV)  tigecycline  at  a  dosage  of  0.75,  1,  or  1.25  mg/kg  (up  to  a 
maximum  dose  of  50  mg)  every  12  hours  infused  over  approximately  30  minutes.  Omitting  the  loading 
dose for the paediatric population was considered acceptable by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) at the 
time  of  the  PIP  agreement,  mainly  due  to  tolerability  issues.  All  subjects  received  IV  tigecycline  for  a 
minimum of 3 days to a maximum of 14 consecutive days. On or after day 4, it was possible to switch to 
oral antibiotics (IV plus oral switch). Escalation to the next dose cohort occurred only after the following: 
1)  safety  and  tolerability  data  at  the  preceding  dose  through  the  last  day  of  therapy  (tigecycline  LDOT) 
had been reviewed by the sponsor, 2) at least 5 of the 6 properly processed PK samples were received by 
the central laboratory from at least 12 subjects (“PK evaluable”), and 3) all available efficacy data were 
reviewed.  
The objectives of this study were to determine the PK profile and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
ascending  multiple  doses  of  tigecycline  in  subjects  aged  8  to  11  years  with  selected  serious  infections 
(cIAI,  cSSSI,  CAP).  Because  of  the  descriptive  nature  of  the  study,  no  formal  statistical  analyses  were 
planned  for  the  efficacy  data.  Evaluation  of  efficacy  data  consisted  primarily  of  summary  displays  (i.e., 
descriptive statistics) by treatment group. 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  consisted  of  59  subjects  who  were  screened  and  randomized  to 
treatment. Of these subjects, 58 subjects received at least 1 dose of tigecycline and were included in the 
modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. The disposition of subjects by treatment group and diagnosis 
in the mITT population is provided in the following table: 
Table 6: Subject Disposition, mITT Population 
For  all  tigecycline-treated  subjects,  the  cure  rates  at  the  LDOT  were  82.4%  in  the  0.75  mg/kg  group, 
52.4%  in  the  1  mg/kg  group,  and  30.0%  in  the  1.25  mg/kg  group.  At  the  TOC  assessment,  94.1%  of 
subjects in the 0.75 mg/kg group, 76.2% of subjects in the 1 mg/kg group, and 75.0% of subjects in the 
1.25 mg/kg group were considered cured. 
For  subjects  with  CAP,  the  cure  rates  at  LDOT  were  100%  in  the  0.75  mg/kg  group,  75.0%  in  the  1 
mg/kg  group,  and  0%  in  the  1.25  mg/kg  group.  At  the  TOC  assessment,  100%  of  subjects  in  the  0.75 
mg/kg and 1 mg/kg groups were considered cured, and 75.0% of subjects in the 1.25 mg/kg group were 
considered cured. 
For  subjects  with  cIAI,  the  cure  rates  at  LDOT  were  100%  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  group,  33.3%  in  the  1-
mg/kg  group,  and  50.0%  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group.  At  the  TOC  assessment,  100%  of  subjects  in  the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 15/35 
 
  
  
 
0.75-mg/kg  group,  50.0%  of  subjects  in  the  1-mg/kg  group,  and  83.3%  of  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg 
group were considered cured. 
For subjects with cSSTI, the cure rates at LDOT were 25.0% in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 42.9% in the 1-
mg/kg group, and 0% in the 1.25-mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 75.0% of subjects in the 0.75-
mg/kg,  71.4%  of  subjects  in  the  1-mg/kg  group,  and  50.0%  of  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group  were 
considered cured. The individual unbound exposure (fuAUC0-24h) values and clinical outcomes were used 
to explore a potential exposure effect. Logistic regression analysis of fuAUC0-24h versus clinical outcome 
failed to demonstrate a contribution of fuAUC0-24h to clinical success. 
Table 7: Summary of Clinical Response Results, mITT Population 
Of the 4 subjects whose response was reported as failure at TOC, the clinical course of 2 suggested a lack 
of  efficacy:  1  had  recurrent  infection  after  incomplete  debridement  (0.75  mg/kg,  subject  2207-030-
000118) and 1 received a prolonged course of oral antibiotics (1.25 mg/kg, subject 2207-007-000019). 
The other 2 subjects whose response was reported as failure were due to protocol deviations. 
A total of 7 subjects had a clinical response that was reported as “indeterminate” (LDOT/TOC) for reasons 
that were unrelated to efficacy.  
Taking  into  account  the  limitations  of  the  small  sample  size,  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  observed 
clinical cure rates for cSSTI and cIAI in paediatric patients across the dose range were generally similar to 
clinical cure rates observed in adults who received the standard approved dosage regimen of tigecycline. 
Efficacy  outcomes  from  12  patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  who  received  tigecycline  on  a 
compassionate use basis 
During  the  clinical  development  of  tigecycline,  patients  were  treated  with  tigecycline  on  an  emergency 
use/compassionate  use  basis  under  single  patient  INDs  or  as  named  patients.  Information  for  104  of 
these subjects was collected, which included data for 12 patients less than 18 years of age.

Eleven  patients  were  in  the  12  to  17  year  age  range,  and  one  patient  was  approximately  3  years  old. 
Body  weight  was  24  to  30  kg  for  3  patients,  36  to  45  kg  for  3  patients,  and  15  kg  for  the  3  year-old 
patient. Weight information was not available for 5 of the patients. 
Among  the  12  patients,  9  were  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  who  had  rapidly  growing  mycobacterial 
infections  (M.  abscessus  or  M.  chelonae).  Among  the  remaining  3  patients,  1  had  disseminated  skin 
lesions  with  M.  chelonae,  1  had  a  sternal  soft  tissue  and  bone  A.  baumannii  infection,  and  1  had  A. 
baumannii bacteraemia (the last was the 3 year-old patient). 
Among  the  patients  between  12  and  17  years  of  age,  4 patients  received  25 to 80 mg tigecycline  (with 
dosing of 25 to 40 mg once or twice daily); 3 received 50 mg twice daily, 1 received 100 mg once daily, 1 
received 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was unknown in 2 patients. The 3 year-old patient received 
tigecycline 40 mg x 2 (units not specified), 20 mg x 2 (units not specified), and then 0.5 mg/kg. Duration 
of dosing was up to 3 months in 7 patients, 3-6 months in 1 patient, 6-12 months in 1 patient, and more 
than  12  months  in  2  patients  (just  over  12  months  in  one  and  approximately  19  months  in  the  other), 
and of unknown duration in one patient. 
Seven  patients  were  considered to  have  improved, 1  was  indeterminate,  and the  others  had little  or  no 
improvement  in  their  signs/symptoms.  CHMP  agreed  that,  similar  to  adults,  the  results  of  the 
compassionate use of tigecycline in 11 children aged 12 to 17 years and one patient who was 3 years old 
suggest that tigecycline may be useful for the treatment of serious infections in children. 
Information from the  medical literature  regarding efficacy outcomes  in patients <18 years  of 
age treated with tigecycline 
A  search  of  the  medical  literature  to  identify  publications  reporting  the  use  of  tigecycline  in  paediatric 
patients was conducted in the biomedical literature databases. Literature reports that only investigated in 
vitro  activity  of  tigecycline  or  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  pathogens  isolated  from  paediatric  patients 
and  that  did  not  include  clinical  use  or  safety  data  were  excluded.  In  addition,  literature  reports  that 
summarised  clinical  trials  with  adult  and  paediatric  patients  were  excluded  if  paediatric  data  were  not 
summarised  separately.  Literature  reports  that  summarised  multiple  individual  case  reports  were 
excluded  if  the  cases  had  already  been  summarised  individually.  Based  on  these  criteria,  a  total  of  14 
articles  that  reported  efficacy  outcomes  and/or  safety  information  in  paediatric  subjects  were  selected. 
The 14 articles discussed the use of tigecycline for the treatment of a variety of infection types, with the 
following  distribution:  2  articles  concerned  cIAI,  and  3  concerned    cSSTI;  2  articles  reported  on  cystic 
fibrosis-related  infections,  3  reported  leukaemia-related  infections,  2  concerned  central  nervous  system 
infections,  and  2  reported  on  lung  infections  treated  with  tigecycline.  CHMP  agreed  that  overall,  the 
information reported in these 14 publications suggests that tigecycline may be useful for the treatment of 
infections in paediatric patients. 
Microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST): A summary of 
the  in  vitro  antibacterial  activity  of  tigecycline  against  pathogens  isolated  from  children  8  to 
<18 years of age globally and in the EU from January 2004 to October 2014. 
Data  from  the  TEST  program  have  been  summarised  for  the  in  vitro  antibacterial  activity  of  tigecycline 
and  comparators  against  pathogens  obtained  from  infections  in  paediatric  patients  ≥8  to  <18  years  of 
age between January 2004 and October 2014. 
Isolates were recovered from clinical infections from both community- and hospital associated sources. In 
all  cases,  only  one  isolate  per  patient  was  allowed.  The  minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  (MICs)  of 
tigecycline  and  the  comparators  were  determined  by  broth  microdilution  (aerobes)  and  agar  dilution 
(anaerobes)  according  to  methodologies  and  guidelines  approved  by  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 
Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  and  the  European  Committee  on  Antimicrobial  Susceptibility  Testing 
(EUCAST).

The  general  report  (adults  and  children)  includes  data  for  10,142  isolates  collected  globally  from  1,907 
study centres in 66 countries; these included 4,090 European isolates from 903 sites in 26 countries.  
Summaries  are  provided  for  isolates  obtained  from  global  sources  and  from  European  populations;  and 
data  are  summarised  for  isolates  from  all  indications,  as  well  as  isolates  from  intra-abdominal  and  skin 
and skin structure sources.  
Tigecycline  showed  in  vitro  activity  against  a  broad  spectrum  of  Gram-negative  and  Gram-positive 
species  including  many  with  common  resistant  phenotypes  such  as  ESBL-producing  Escherichia  coli  and 
Klebsiella species, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 
vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
Global and European data demonstrated the same tigecycline in vitro activity, with inhibition of 100% of 
the S. aureus (n=1,902) and 99.8% of the enterococci (n=447) in the global collection at their respective 
breakpoints  without  regard  to  methicillin-  or  vancomycin-resistant  phenotypes.  Activity  against 
Enterobacteriaceae (n=3,373) from the global population was high, with 98% of all isolates and 97.9% of 
all  extended-spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)  producing  isolates  (n=290)  tested  in  this  study  inhibited  at 
the  current  FDA  susceptibility  breakpoint  of  2  mg/L.  European  data  showed  92.5%  of  all 
Enterobacteriaceae (n=1,154) and 86.0% of all ESBLs (n=121) inhibited at the EUCAST breakpoint of 1 
mg/L.  
Tigecycline was also active against Acinetobacter spp. (n=560), including A. baumannii and A. lwoffii, and 
Stenotrophomonas  maltophilia  (n=32),  with  MIC90  values  of  1  mg/L,  although  it  had  limited  activity 
against  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa.  Tigecycline  showed  MIC90  values  of  2  and  1  mg/L,  respectively, 
against  gram-negative  anaerobes  Bacteroides  spp.  (n=97)  and  Prevotella  spp.  (n=44),  and  had  activity 
against  the  gram-positive  anaerobes  Clostridium  spp.  (n=24),  Parvimonas  micra  (n=14),  and 
Peptostreptococcus spp. (n=13), with MIC90 values of 0.12, ≤0.06, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
PK  and  safety  data  are  available  from  two  PK  studies  in  paediatric  subjects:  single-dose  study  110  and 
multiple-dose  study  2207  (which  included  descriptive  efficacy  data).  Study  2207  was  submitted  in 
accordance with article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended. As the study was primarily a 
PK  study  and  at  that  time  two  paediatric  safety  and  efficacy  studies  were  planned,  limited  analysis  of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

efficacy  and  safety  was  done.  In  addition,  the  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  children  who  received 
tigecycline in the setting of compassionate use (12 patients), paediatric use reported in the literature (14 
articles reporting efficacy and/or safety in a total of 33 patients aged <18 years). Finally, a summary of 
the microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated 
from children 8 to <18 years of age has been submitted. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  results  from  study  2207  are  provided  descriptively.  Clinical  cure  at  TOC  is  higher  for  the  lower 
dose  (0.75  mg/kg)  than  for  the  highest doses.  However,  the  limited  number of  patients  and the  lack of 
standardisation  regarding  concomitant  antibiotic  therapy  (other  than  tigecycline)  may  have  influenced 
(among others) the results and do not permit to draw appropriate conclusions.  
For  subjects  with  cIAI,  the  cure  rates  at  LDOT  were  100%  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  group,  33.3%  in  the  1-
mg/kg  group,  and  50.0%  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group.  At  the  TOC  assessment,  100%  of  subjects  in  the 
0.75-mg/kg  group,  50.0%  of  subjects  in  the  1-mg/kg  group,  and  83.3%  of  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg 
group were considered cured. 
For subjects with cSSTI, the cure rates at LDOT were 25.0% in the 0.75-mg/kg group, 42.9% in the 1-
mg/kg group, and 0% in the 1.25-mg/kg group. At the TOC assessment, 75.0% of subjects in the 0.75-
mg/kg,  71.4%  of  subjects  in  the  1-mg/kg  group,  and  50.0%  of  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group  were 
considered cured. 
Among  children  who  received  tigecycline  on  a  compassionate  use  basis,  9  out  of  12  were  patients  with 
cystic fibrosis. Among the remaining 3 patients, 1 had disseminated skin lesions, 1 had a soft tissue and 
bone infection, and 1 had A. baumannii bacteraemia. Eleven cases are children aged 12 years and older; 
one  case  treated  with  tigecycline  was  3  years  old.  After  tigecycline  therapy,  7  of  the  12  patients  were 
considered  to  have  improved,  in  one  patient  the  outcome  was  indeterminate,  and  the  remaining  4 
patients had little or no improvement in their signs/symptoms. 
Based  on  the  data  presented  by  the  MAH  concerning  the  compassionate  use  and  use  reported  on  the 
literature,  it  appears  that  most  of  the  paediatric  use  is  outside  of  the  approved  indications  in  adults 
(bacteraemia, cystic fibrosis, meningitis, pneumonia) and across all paediatric age subsets (the youngest 
2.5  months  old).  The  outcomes  differ  according  to  the  indication  in  which  tigecycline  is  used  but  are 
indicative that tigecycline has the potential for treating serious infections where other alternatives are not 
available  or  have  failed.  The  review  of  these  data  also  shows  that  tigecycline  is  usually  administered  in 
combination with other antibiotics. 
Data  from  the  ongoing  TEST  surveillance  program  from  patients  in  the  age  range  of  the  proposed 
paediatric indications show no major differences among all indications, and specifically isolates from intra-
abdominal and skin and skin structure sources. Tigecycline also showed in vitro activity against a broad 
spectrum  of  gram  negative  and  gram-positive  resistant  bacteria  such  as  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  and 
Klebsiella  spp,  multidrug-resistant  Acinetobacter  spp,  methicillin-resistant  S.aureus  and  vancomycin-
resistant enterococci.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the efficacy of tigecycline has not been fully investigated in the paediatric population. Mainly the 
PK/PD modelling is used for extrapolating the efficacy of tigecycline from adults to support the approval in 
children aged 8 to less than 18 years for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI with limited therapeutic options.  
According  to  the  “Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for 
treatment  of  bacterial  infections”,  limited  evidence  of  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  could  be  accepted  to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

support  an  approval  for  the  treatment  of  infections  caused  by  MDR  organism  for  which  there  are  few 
therapeutic  options.  Considering  that  the  use  of  tygecicline  will  be  limited  to  the  treatment  of  serious 
infections  caused by multidrug  resistant  microorganisms  to  available  alternatives, CHMP  considered  that 
the  limited  evidence  submitted,  together  with  the  microbiological  data  presented  and  the  extrapolation 
approach  based  on  PK/PD  modelling  were  sufficient  to  support  such  a  restricted  paediatric  indication, 
given that the microorganisms involved in these infections are similar in both the adult and the paediatric 
populations. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
While tigecycline has not been fully investigated in the paediatric population for treatment of cSSTI and 
cIAI,  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  safety  data  are  available  from  2  clinical  pharmacology  studies  in 
paediatric subjects: 
•  Study 3074A1-110-US: single-dose study in 25 children 8 to 16 years of age; and 
•  Study 3074K4-2207-WW: multiple-dose study in 58 children 8 to 11 years of age. 
Information  supporting  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  tigecycline  in  children  <18  years  of  age  is  also 
derived  from  12  subjects  <18  years  of  age  who  were  treated  on  a  compassionate  use  basis  and  were 
included in a summary report of compassionate use experience.  
Safety  information  is  also  available  from  cases  for  children  <18  years  of  age  that  are  reported  in  the 
MAH’s safety database.

Overall, the number of treatment doses received was generally similar across treatment groups. Subjects 
in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group  received  fewer  doses  of  tigecycline  than  subjects  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  and  1-
mg/kg  groups,  but  the  overall  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.209).  Subjects  received  a 
mean  of  13.0  doses  of  tigecycline  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  treatment  group,  12.6  doses  in  the  1-mg/kg 
treatment group, and 9.8 doses in the 1.25-mg/kg group. 
A  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  1-mg/kg  (28.6%)  and  1.25-mg/kg  (55.0%)  treatment  groups 
switched  to  oral  antibiotic  therapy  compared  with  subjects  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  treatment  group  (17.7%) 
but  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.060).  For  subjects  who  were  switched  to  oral 
antibiotic  therapy,  the  mean  duration  of  therapy  was  5.7  days  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  treatment  group,  7.7 
days  in  the  1-mg/kg  treatment  group,  and  4.2  days  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  treatment  group  (p=0.185).  All 
but  1  subject  in  the  mITT  population  (98.3%)  received  at  least  80%  and  not  more  than  120%  of  the 
expected dosage of tigecycline. 
Compassionate use 
In  addition, 12 subjects <18 years of age received various doses of tigecycline on a compassionate use 
basis. Among the patients between 12 and 17 years of age, 4 patients received 25 to 80 mg tigecycline 
(with dosing of 25 to 40 mg once or twice daily); 3 received 50 mg twice daily, 1 received 100 mg once 
daily, 1 received 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was unknown in 2 patients. The 3 year-old patient 
received tigecycline 40 mg x 2 (units not specified), 20 mg x 2 (units not specified), and then 0.5 mg/kg. 
Duration of dosing was up to 3 months in 7 patients, 3-6 months in 1 patient, 6-12 months in 1 patient, 
and more than 12 months in 2 patients (just over 12 months in one and approximately 19 months in the 
other), and of unknown duration in one patient. 
Adverse events 
Study  110  –  Among  the  25  subjects  who  received  a  single  administration  of  tigecycline  and  were 
included  in  the  safety  analysis,  8  subjects  (32%)  had  TEAEs.  The  most  frequent  AEs  were  vomiting  (4 
subjects,  16%),  nausea  (3  subjects,  12%),  and  headache  (2  subjects,  8%),  with  the  nausea  and 
vomiting occurring  in  the  higher  dose  groups  (1  mg/kg  and  2  mg/kg),  but  not  in  children  who  received 
0.5  mg/kg.  Three  subjects  in  the  higher  dose  groups  (1  mg/kg  and  2  mg/kg)  had  both  nausea  and 
vomiting, which were considered to be mild in 2 subjects and moderate in one subject. One subject in the 
1  mg/kg  group  had  severe  vomiting  and  associated  dehydration  (moderate),  for  which  he  was 
hospitalised.  While  one  child  who  had  very  high  serum  concentrations  of  tigecycline  (as  measured  by 
area-under-the concentration-time curve [AUC]) experienced nausea and/or vomiting, the AUC values for 
children who experienced nausea and/or vomiting usually fell within the range of AUC values for children 
who did not experience nausea and/or vomiting. 
Study 2207 – Among the 58 subjects who received at least 1 dose of tigecycline, 44 subjects (75.9%) 
experienced  one  or  more  treatment-emergent-adverse-events  (TEAEs).  The  most  frequently  reported 
TEAEs  were  related  to  the  gastrointestinal  system.  The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  overall  were 
nausea  and  vomiting.  Nausea  was  reported  in  significantly  higher  percentages  of  subjects  in  the  1.25-
mg/kg  group  (60.0%)  and  1.0-mg/kg  group  (61.9%)  compared  with  the  0.75-mg/kg  group  (17.6%) 
(p=0.018 and p=0.009, respectively). 
The majority of nausea and vomiting events were reported as mild to moderate in severity (grades 1 or 
2).  Two  (2)  subjects  with  cIAI  receiving  1.25  mg/kg  of  tigecycline  had  TEAEs  of  vomiting  with  grade  3 
toxicity.  The  investigators  assessed  the  TEAEs  as  related  to  treatment  in  1  subject  and  not  related  to 
treatment in the other subject. 
In the System Organ Class (SOC) “Investigations” 15 (25.9%) subjects reported some adverse events. In 
the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations,  9  (15.5%)  subjects  reported  the  following  adverse  events: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 22/35 
 
  
  
candidiasis  (a  subject  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group),  oral  candidiasis  (a  subject  in  the  1.25-mg/kg 
dosing  group),  post  procedural  infection  (a  subject  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group),  postoperative 
wound infection (2 patients in the 0.75-mg/kg dosing group), superinfection (a subject in the 0.75-mg/kg 
dosing group), Tinea capitis (a subject in the 1-mg/kg dosing group) and viral upper respiratory infection 
(a  subject  in  the  0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group).  Two  (3.4%)  subjects  reported  convulsions  in  the  1-mg/kg 
dosing group. A subject (1.7%) reported dysgeusia and other headache (1.7%). 
Nausea and vomiting were considered treatment-related in most cases, i.e. in 22/58 (37.9%) of patients 
and in 19/58 (32.8%) of patients respectively. This was also the case of anorexia, dysgeusia and pruritus 
that  were  reported  by  a  single  subject  each.  Lab  abnormalities  were  considered  treatment-related  for 7 
patients (12.1%) as follows: 
Seven (12.1%) of these patients reported adverse events that were considered drug-related as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  prolonged:  1  (1.7%)  subject,  in  the  1.25-  mg/kg  dosing 
groups.  
Alanine  aminotransferase  increased:  2  (3.4%)  subjects,  one  on  0.75  mg/kg  and  other  on  1 
mg/kg. 
Bilirubin conjugated increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group. 
Blood amylase increased: 2 (3.4%) subjects (1 on 0.75 mg/kg and 1 on 1.25 mg/kg). 
Blood bilirubin increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group. 
Blood phosphorus increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group. 
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1-mg/kg dosing group. 
International normalised ratio increased: 1 (1.7%) subject in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group. 
Lipase increased: 2 (3.4) subjects in 1.25-mg/kg dosing group. 
Platelet count increased: 1 (1.7%) in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group. 
Prothrombin time prolonged: 1 (1.7%) in the 1.25-mg/kg dosing group.   
Compassionate  Use  –  Among  the  12  subjects  <18  years  of  age  who  received  tigecycline  on  a 
compassionate  use  basis,  10  (83.3%)  were  reported  to  have  experienced  1  or  more  AEs.  The  most 
frequently  reported  AEs  were  related  to  the  digestive  system:  nausea  was  reported  for  8  subjects 
(66.7%), and vomiting was reported for 5 subjects (41.7%).   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred during study 110 or study 2207, and none of the 12 paediatric patients died during 
compassionate use treatment. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Study 110 – One subject (4.0%) experienced an SAE of vomiting associated with dehydration. This 11-
year-old  male  subject  in  the  1.0  mg/kg  group  was  hospitalised  for  treatment,  and  the  events  resolved. 
The vomiting was considered to be severe, and dehydration was considered to be moderate in severity. 
Both events were considered to be definitely related to tigecycline. 
Study 2207 – SAEs were reported for 3 subjects (5.2%). One subject with cIAI receiving 0.75 mg/kg of 
tigecycline had an SAE of postoperative wound infection. Two subjects with cSSTI had SAEs: 1 subject in 
the  1.0  mg/kg  group  had  an  SAE  of  anal  fistula  and  1  subject  in  the  1.25  mg/kg  group  had  an  SAE  of 
abdominal pain.

Laboratory findings 
Study 110 - Four subjects had abnormal laboratory values of potential clinical importance, including low 
phosphorus, high blood urea nitrogen, low neutrophils, and high eosinophils. These abnormal values were 
considered not clinically important by the medical monitor. 
Study 2207  
Overall,  45  of  57  (78.9%)  subjects  had  1  or  more  potentially  clinically  important  (PCI)  laboratory  test 
results  while  on  therapy.  Decreased  sodium  was  reported  for  5.9%  of  subjects  in  the  0.75  mg/kg 
treatment  group,  23.8%  of  subjects  in  the  1.0  mg/kg  treatment  group,  and  in  no  subjects  in  the  1.25 
mg/kg  treatment  group.  This  finding,  while  statistically  significant  (p=0.031),  did  not  correlate  with 
increasing doses of tigecycline and was not believed to be clinically significant. 
The most frequently occurring PCI results while on therapy were high platelet count, occurring in 21 of 57 
(36.8%)  subjects,  and  low  or  decreased  albumin,  occurring  in  15  of  48  (31.3%)  subjects  in  the  mITT 
population.  
Electrocardiograms 
In study 2207, ECG recordings were read and interpreted at the investigative site and were then sent to a 
central laboratory. Corrected QT (QTc) intervals were calculated using the Bazett and Fridericia methods. 
Overall, no meaningful differences were noted among the treatment groups in the incidence of PCI ECG 
results.    
Safety in special populations 
The number of subjects <18 years of age who received tigecycline in the 2 clinical pharmacology studies 
was  too  small  to  permit  a  meaningful  assessment  of  the  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  on  the  safety  of 
tigecycline. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  studies  were  conducted  in  paediatric  subjects  regarding  the  potential  of  drug-drug  or  drug-food 
interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study  110  –  One  subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  an  adverse  event.  A  12-year-old 
male  subject  in  the  2.0  mg/kg  group  had  an  injection  site  reaction  (infiltration  at  the  IV  site)  and  was 
withdrawn from the study. This AE was considered mild in severity and not related to tigecycline. 
Study 2207 – Two subjects (3.4%) discontinued tigecycline and were withdrawn from the study because 
of adverse events. One subject in the 1 mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of lipase 
increased,  and  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  AEs  of  pancreatitis,  blood  amylase  increased, 
and lipase increased. One subject in the 1.25 mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of 
blood amylase increased and was withdrawn from the study because of an AE of lipase increased. 
Post marketing experience 
As of 30 September 2014, 64 paediatric cases (<18 years of age), including 125 AEs, have been received 
worldwide  by  the  sponsor;  these  include  54  spontaneous  reports  and  10  literature  reports.  These  64 
cases  do  not  include  SAE  reports  in  the  safety  database  that  are  derived  from  clinical  studies  or 
compassionate  use,  which  have  already  been  discussed.  Of  the  64  total  reported  cases,  21  patients

(32.8%)  were  female,  27 (42.2%)  were  male,  and  for  16  (25.0%)  the  gender  was  not  reported  or  was 
unknown.  For  the  56  cases  in  which  age  was  reported,  the  minimum  age  was  preterm  infant  and  the 
maximum age was 17 years (mean of 10.3 years, median of 12.0 years). The cases were mostly from the 
United Kingdom (10; 15.6%), United States (10; 15.6%), France (6; 9.4%), Germany (4; 6.3%), Israel 
(4;  6.3%),  Russian  Federation  (4;  6.3%),  China  (3;  4.7%)  and  Greece  (3;  4.7%),  with  2  cases  (3.1%) 
each  from  Croatia,  Finland,  Italy,  South  Korea,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  and  Turkey.  Case  outcome  was 
reported  as  fatal  in  6  cases  (9.4%),  not  recovered/not  resolved  in  6  (9.4%),  recovered/resolved  in  20 
(31.3%), recovering/resolving in 2 (3.1%) and unknown in 30 (46.9%). Twenty-five (25; 39.1%) of the 
cases were serious and 39 (60.9%) non serious. 
The  majority  of  the  reported  indications  would  be  considered  off-label  use  based  on  approved  adult 
indications. 
Adverse events were summarised using MedDRA (version 17.0). Among the 64 paediatric cases, the most 
frequently reported adverse events (Preferred Terms) were off-label use (19 cases; 29.7%), vomiting (10 
cases; 15.6%), nausea (9 cases; 14.1%), oedematous pancreatic /pancreatitis/pancreatitis acute (1/3/3 
cases  respectively;  total  11.0%),  and  sepsis  (4  cases;  6.3%).  Seven  cases  (11.0%)  reported  a  term 
consistent  with  elevated  hepatic  transaminases  (i.e.  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  aspartate 
aminotransferase  increased,  hepatic  enzymes  increased,  transaminases  increased).  Of  the  19  cases 
reporting off-label use as an adverse event, 11 cases reported no additional AE and 8 cases reported an 
AE  in  addition  to  off-label  use.  While  only  some  of  the  cases  were  coded  to  off-label  use,  all  of  these 
cases are off-label use, based on the current lack of an approved indication in paediatric patients. 
Post-Authorisation Safety Study (Study B1811184) 
Study  B1811184  was  a  non-interventional,  retrospective,  chart  abstraction,  post-authorisation  safety 
study,  conducted  in  the  EU  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk  minimisation  measures  (RMM) 
implemented  for the  newly  identified  risk  of  superinfection,  and  the  safety  concerns  of  potential  for  off-
label  use  and  potential  for  lack  of  efficacy  (Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  update,  Direct  to 
Healthcare  Professional  Communication,  and  a  healthcare  provider  educational  program).  The  study 
described  indications  for  tigecycline  use  and  clinical  outcomes  among  adult  patients  with  cIAI  or  cSSTI 
treated with approved doses of tigecycline in the EU before and after implementation of the RMM. As one 
of  the  objectives  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  off-label  use  of  tigecycline,  any  cases  describing 
paediatric patients were included. Out of a total of 777 subjects included in the study, 7 patients younger 
than 18 years of age at hospital admission were identified; 2 were treated before the RMM and 5 after the 
RMM. The paediatric patients ranged in age from 12 to 17 years.  
Indications  for  tigecycline  use  in  the  paediatric  patients  included  one  cIAI  (intestinal  perforation),  two 
cSSTI (wound infection, chronic mycobacterium abscess infection) and 4 other indications (bacteraemia, 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas colonisation, and 
infective  exacerbation  of  bronchiectasis).  AEs  with  explicit  attribution  (‘related’)  to  any  Pfizer  medicine 
that  were  documented  in  the  charts  for  abstraction  had  to  be  reported.  None  of  the  paediatric  subjects 
had an AE reported, and all 7 patients were discharged alive. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The  main  set  of  data  contributing  to  the  assessment  of  the  safety  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric 
population derived from the multiple-dose PK study 2207. These are the results highlighted below. Useful 
information can also be derived from the single-dose study 110 and from data on the compassionate use 
of tigecycline in 12 adolescents. Additional data are discussed for 64 subjects under 18 years of age that 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 25/35 
 
  
  
are reported in the MAH’s safety database (post-marketing). In study 2207, 44/58 (75.9%) subjects were 
reported  with  1  or  more  treatment-emergent-adverse  events  (TEAEs).  The  most  frequently  occurring 
TEAEs  overall  were  nausea  and  vomiting,  with  higher  percentages  of  subjects  in  the  1.25-mg/kg  group 
(65.0%)  and  1-mg/kg  group  (61.9%)  reporting  events  of  nausea  compared  with  the  0.75-mg/kg  group 
(17.6%  each).  Similarly,  higher  rates  of  vomiting  were  noted  in  subjects  receiving  1  mg/kg  (52.4%) or 
1.25 mg/kg (55.0%) of tigecycline compared with subjects receiving 0.75 mg/kg (29.4%) of tigecycline, 
The  majority of  nausea  and  vomiting events  were  reported  as  mild  to  moderate  in  toxicity  (grades  1 or 
2).  Two  (2)  TEAEs  of  vomiting  in  subjects  with  complicated  intra-abdominal  infection  were  reported  as 
grade 3 toxicity. 
Nausea and vomiting were considered treatment-related in most cases, i.e. in 22/58 (37.9%) of patients 
and in 19/58 (32.8%) of patients respectively. This was also the case of anorexia, dysgeusia and pruritus 
that  were  reported  by  a  single  subject  each.  Lab  abnormalities  were  considered  treatment-related  for 7 
patients (12.1%).  
Three  (3,  5.2%)  subjects  had  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  during  the  study.  One  (1;  4.2%)  subject 
with  cIAI  receiving  0.75  mg/kg  of  tigecycline  had  an  SAE  of  postoperative  wound  infection.  Two  (2; 
13.3%) subjects with cSSSI had SAEs: 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group had an SAE of anal fistula and 1 
subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group had an SAE of abdominal pain.  
Two  (2,  3.4%)  subjects  discontinued  tigecycline  because  of  adverse  events  (AEs).  Among  subjects  with 
cIAI, 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of lipase increased, and 1 
subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of blood amylase increased.  
Although it is stated that in most instances no significant differences among treatment groups exist, the 
data suggest that indeed the incidence of adverse events is dose-dependent when the two dosing groups 
of 1-mg/kg and 1.25-mg/kg are compared to the 0.75-mg/kg dosing group. In particular, for nausea and 
vomiting  an  analysis  was  performed  showing  that  there  is  an  overlap  in  AUC  values  between  patients 
having nausea or vomiting or both and those who had not such adverse events. However, Cmax (rather 
than AUC) may be most relevant in this respect. As part of the assessment of study 2207 in accordance 
with  article  46  of  the  paediatric  regulation  it  was  clarified  that  Cmax  was  the  highest  concentration 
observed  of  those  collected  from  individual  patients,  regardless  of  the  time  of  the  collection.  The  study 
design  called  for  an  infusion  over  approximately  30  minutes  but  the  end  of  the  infusion  time  was  not 
collected  as  part  of  the  study.  Although  it  cannot  be  clearly  ascertained  whether  there  is  a  relationship 
between  higher  Cmax  and  shorter  times  of  infusion  or  between  higher  Cmax  and  higher  incidence  of 
nausea and/or vomiting it should be considered, as a precaution, whether a warning should be included in 
section  4.2  or  4.4  recommending  a  60-minute  length  of  infusion  for  children,  in  particular  for  children 
presenting  with  nausea  and/or  vomiting  since  the  infusion  rate  is  not  expected  to  modify  the  total 
exposure to tigecycline.   
The  MAH  concluded  that  no  new  or  unexpected  safety  concerns  were  observed  with  tigecycline  in  the 
patient  population  of  study  2207.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  this  conclusion.  The  AEs  reported  in  the 
spontaneous and literature cases from paediatric patients are generally consistent with identified adverse 
reactions reported in adult patients and included in section 4.8 of the approved SmPC of Tygacil.   
Regarding  the  information  to  be  provided  in  section  4.8,  the  SmPC  guideline  states  (in  relation  to  the 
paediatric  population)  that  “any  clinically  relevant  differences  (i.e.  in  nature,  frequency,  seriousness  or 
reversibility  of  adverse  reactions)  between  the  safety  profiles  in  adult  and  paediatric  populations,  or  in 
any relevant age groups, should be described and presented by age group. If there is a need for specific 
monitoring,  this  should  be  highlighted  by  cross-referencing  to  section  4.4.  For  clinically  relevant 
differences, a separate table listing such adverse reactions by frequency can be added and presented by 
relevant age groups if appropriate.”

SmPC section 4.8 has been amended by the MAH to provide the frequency of nausea and vomiting. This 
is  endorsed,  as  it  appears  that  these  adverse  reactions  are  more  frequent  in  the  paediatric  population 
than  in  adults.  For  the  remaining  adverse  reactions  listed  in  section  4.8  for  adults,  in  order  to  clarify 
whether  this  was  or  was  not  the  case,  the  MAH  provided  a  comparative  table  showing  the  frequency  of 
adverse  events  for  which  the  relationship  to  tigecycline  could  not  be  excluded  between  adult  patients 
included in the pivotal studies in cIAI and cSSTI and children included in study 2207 (as three doses have 
been used the frequencies corresponding to the worst case should be used). Based on the provided data, 
the final MAH proposal was to additionally include in section 4.8 lipase elevation. This was agreed by the 
CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The use of tigecycline is expected to be limited to children for whom no alternative antibacterial drugs are 
available. Overall, from a safety perspective, no new safety signals have arisen. Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
was  updated  to  include  nausea,  vomiting  and  lipase  elevation,  which  have  different  frequencies  of 
appearance in adults and children. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan could be acceptable if the applicant implements the 
changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC. Two minor revisions are 
required with the next RMP update: 
• 
Paediatric studies 3074A1-110-US (B1811108) and 3074K4-2207-WW (B1811001) should also be 
included in the table of Completed Studies /Activities from the Pharmacovigilance Plan. 
•  According to the GVP Module V- RMP part VII (Annexes to the risk management), the RMP should 
contain the annexes in part VII. Therefore the annexes should be included in part VII of the RMP 
as part of the document. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 12.1 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
The MAH submitted an extension of indication application for the restricted use of Tygacil (tigecycline) in 
paediatric patients ≥8 years to <18 years of age. The proposed indications for tigecycline in children are 
the  same  as  those  approved  for  adult  patients.  This  proposal  is  mainly  based  on  two  PK  paediatric 
studies.  In addition, the MAH has submitted data from children who received tigecycline in the setting of 
compassionate  use  (12  patients),  and  paediatric  use  reported  on  the  literature  (14  articles  reporting 
efficacy and/or safety in a total of 33 patients aged <18 years). Finally, a summary of the microbiology 
data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated from children 8 
to <18 years of age has been submitted. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  efficacy  of  tigecycline  has  not  been  fully  investigated  in  the  paediatric  population.  Mainly  PK/PD 
modelling  is  used  for  extrapolating  the  efficacy  of  tigecycline  from  adults  to  support  the  approval  in 
children (aged 8 to <18 years).

When  data  were  individually  analysed  by  non-compartmental  methods  in  study  2207,  the  estimated  PK 
parameters  showed  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric  population  differed  from 
that in adults. The mean Vss was half the value observed in adults. Conversely, weight adjusted plasma 
clearance was higher than in adults. These results translated in higher Cmax in children than in adults but 
in lower AUC values for children than in adults for doses of 1 or 1.25 mg/kg.  
The  AUC0-24h  observed  in  adults  at  the  approved  dose  is  approximately  5.0  mg•h/L;  thus,  for  AUC  0-
12h, the target would be 2.5 mg•h/L. The value of the AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios that have been identified in 
adult  patients  are  ≥17.9  for  cSSTI  and  ≥6.96  for  cIAI.  For  cSSTI,  the  target  attainment  in  adults 
receiving the approved tigecycline dosing regimen of 100 mg followed by 50 mg q12h was estimated at 
57.0% of patients while for cIAI the percent of attainment was 82.4% of patients. The estimated percent 
of  target  attainment  for  children  aged  8  to  less  than  18  years  based  on  the  Monte-Carlo  simulation  is 
81.6%  for  complicated intra-abdominal infections  (cIAI)  and  54.5%  for  complicated  skin  and  soft tissue 
infections  (cSSTI)  for  the  proposed  dose  of  1.2  mg/kg  every  12  hours.  These  figures  for  model-based 
simulation of the same dose are 86.5% and 62.0% for children aged 8 to less than 12 years. For children 
aged 12 to less than 18 years, the percent of target attainment according to model-based simulations for 
the  proposed  dose  of  50  mg  every  12  hours  were  87.4%  and  64.1%  for  cIAI  and  cSSTIs,  respectively. 
The  pop-PK-PD  model-based  simulations  of  percent  of  target  attainment  lead  to  higher  estimates  of 
paediatric patients at or above the adult predefined target. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The main uncertainty is the lack of robust evidence of efficacy while the current application is supported 
by  PK/PD  and  safety  data  to  extrapolate  from  adults  to  children.  Given  the  safety  profile  of  tigecycline 
and  the  expected  restricted  use  in  clinical  practice  in  situations  where  no  other  treatment  options  are 
available, CHMP agreed that this was sufficient.  
Regarding the population pharmacokinetic model, a two compartmental model with weight as a covariate 
of  clearance  best  described  the  data,  as  it  occurred  for  adults.  The  process  followed  during  model 
development  seems  reasonable  although  the  residual  error  of  the  model  was  high  (43.8%)  and  could 
have  an  impact  in  the  results  of  the  simulated  individual  concentrations  used  for  percent  of  target 
attainment. 
The  pop-PK-PD  model-based  simulations  of  percent  of  target  attainment  lead  to  higher  estimates  of 
paediatric  patients  at  or  above  the  adult  predefined  target.  It  could  be  discussed  whether  the  proposed 
dose of 1.2 mg/kg for children aged 8 to less than 12 years is appropriate or whether a lower dose such 
as 1 mg/kg may be more appropriate. CHMP nevertheless agreed with the MAH’s proposed dose, due to 
the fact that tigecycline is expected to be used for the treatment of serious infections in children when no 
other alternatives can be used. 
Only  descriptive  efficacy  data  from  PK  studies  as  well  as  from  compassionate use  and  literature  reports 
have  been  provided.  The  low  number  of  patients  and  the  lack  of  standardisation  regarding  concomitant 
antibiotic  therapy  (other  than  tigecycline)  may  have  influenced  the  results  (among  others)  and  drawing 
conclusions  from  the  PK  studies  had  some  limitations.  Data  from  clinical  practice  use  were  also  of  little 
support  for  the  claimed  indications,  but  CHMP  agreed  that  they  were  suggestive  of  the  fact  that 
tigecycline  has  the  potential  for  treating  serious  infections  where  other  alternatives  are  not  available  or 
have  failed.  In  the  absence  of  formal  clinical  studies,  the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  in  the  claimed 
indications could however not be fully elucidated.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  main  set  of  data  contributing  to  the  assessment  of  the  safety  of  tigecycline  in  the  paediatric 
population derived from the multiple-dose PK study 2207.  
In  study  2207,  44/58  (75.9%)  subjects  were  reported  with  1  or  more  treatment-emergent-adverse 
events  (TEAEs).  The  most  frequently  occurring  TEAEs  overall  were  nausea  and  vomiting,  with  higher 
percentages of subjects in the 1.25-mg/kg group (65.0%) and 1-mg/kg group (61.9%) reporting events 
of  nausea  compared  with the  0.75-mg/kg group  (17.6%  each).  Similarly,  higher  rates of  vomiting  were 
noted  in  subjects  receiving  1  mg/kg  (52.4%)  or  1.25  mg/kg  (55.0%)  of  tigecycline  compared  with 
subjects receiving 0.75 mg/kg (29.4%) of tigecycline, The majority of nausea and vomiting events were 
reported  as  mild  to  moderate  in  toxicity  (grades  1  or  2).  Two  (2)  TEAEs  of  vomiting  in  subjects  with 
complicated intra-abdominal infection were reported as grade 3 toxicity. 
Nausea and vomiting were considered treatment-related in most cases, i.e. in 22/58 (37.9%) of patients 
and in 19/58 (32.8%) of patients respectively. This was also the case of anorexia, dysgeusia and pruritus 
that  were  reported  by  a  single  subject  each.  Lab  abnormalities  were  considered  treatment-related  for 7 
patients (12.1%).  
Three  (3,  5.2%)  subjects  had  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  during  the  study.  One  (1;  4.2%)  subject 
with  cIAI  receiving  0.75  mg/kg  of  tigecycline  had  an  SAE  of  postoperative  wound  infection.  Two  (2; 
13.3%) subjects with cSSSI had SAEs: 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group had an SAE of anal fistula and 1 
subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group had an SAE of abdominal pain.  
Two  (2,  3.4%)  subjects  discontinued  tigecycline  because  of  adverse  events  (AEs).  Among  subjects  with 
cIAI, 1 subject in the 1-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of lipase increased, and 1 
subject in the 1.25-mg/kg group discontinued tigecycline because of an AE of blood amylase increased.  
No new or unexpected safety concerns were observed with tigecycline in the patient population of study 
2207. The AEs reported in these spontaneous and literature cases from paediatric patients were generally 
consistent with the identified adverse reactions reported in adult patients and were included in section 4.8 
of the Tygacil SmPC.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  main  uncertainties  are  based  on  the  overall  limited  paediatric  safety  database.  However,  given  the 
current restricted use in adults and the limited use expected in children restricted to patients with serious 
infectious were no other treatment alternatives are available, CHMP agreed that this would be considered 
acceptable. 
Data suggest that the incidence of adverse events is dose-dependent when the two dosing groups of 1-
mg/kg  and  1.25-mg/kg  are  compared  to  the  0.75-mg/kg  dosing  group.  As  part  of  the  assessment  of 
study  2207  in  accordance  with  article  46  of  the  paediatric  regulation  it  was  clarified  that  Cmax  was  the 
highest  concentration  observed  of those  collected  from  individual  patients,  regardless of  the time  of the 
collection.  The  study  design  called  for  an  infusion  over  approximately  30  minutes  but  the  end  of  the 
infusion time was not collected as part of the study. Although it could not be clearly ascertained whether 
there was a relationship between the higher Cmax and shorter times of infusion or between higher Cmax 
and  higher  incidence  of  nausea  and/or  vomiting,  CHMP  agreed  to  include  an  appropriate  wording  in 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the Tygacil SmPC, recommending a 60-minute length of infusion for children, in 
particular  for  children  presenting  with  nausea  and/or  vomiting  since  the  infusion  rate  is  not expected to 
modify the total exposure to tigecycline.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Tigecycline  is  a  semisynthetic  derivative  of  minocycline  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  antibacterial  activity 
that  includes  microorganisms  that  are  resistant to other  more  commonly  used  antibiotics.  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa  and  the  Proteeae  (Proteus  species  and  related  organisms)  are  exceptions  to  this  broad-
spectrum activity of tigecycline. In addition, some species such as Bacteroides fragilis and Acinetobacter 
baumannii show a wide distribution of susceptibilities to tigecycline. 
Tygacil (tigecycline) is indicated in adults for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections 
(cSSTI),  excluding  diabetic  foot  infections,  and  for  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  (cIAI)  only  in 
situations  where  it  is  known  or  suspected  that  other  alternatives  are  not  suitable.  This  restricted 
indication was the consequence of a re-assessment of the benefit-risk profile of Tygacil during the 2011 
renewal of the product.  
The  MAH  submitted  an  extension  of  indication  for  the  restricted  use  of  Tygacil  in  paediatric  patients  ≥8 
years  to  <18  years  of  age.  The  proposed  indications  for  tigecycline  in  children  are  the  same  as  those 
approved for adult patients. Similarly to adults, the labelling will specify that tigecycline is only to be used 
in children when no alternative antibacterial drugs are suitable. The submission is mainly based on two PK 
paediatric  studies:  an  ascending  single-dose  study  in  subjects  8  to  16  years  of  age  recovering  from 
infections  (Study  110),  and  a  multiple-dose  study  in  patients  8  to  11  years  with  cSSTI,  cIAI,  or 
community-acquired  pneumonia  (Study  2207).    In  addition,  the  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  children 
who received tigecycline in the setting of compassionate use (12 patients), and paediatric use reported on 
the  literature  (14  articles  reporting  efficacy  and/or  safety  in  a  total  of  33  patients  aged  <18  years). 
Finally, a summary of the microbiology data from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 
of pathogens isolated from children 8 to <18 years of age has been submitted. 
The  use  of  tigecycline  in  children  younger  than  8  years  old  may  be  associated  with  permanent  tooth 
discolouration if used during tooth development and a waiver was granted for studies in children <8 years 
of  age  in  December  2008.  Nevertheless  tigecycline  may  constitute  the  only  alternative  for  children  with 
infections produced by multi-resistant (mainly Gram-negative) microorganisms, and during this procedure  
CHMP  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  granting  a  last  line  indication  in  children  and  whether  of  dosing 
recommendations for children aged 8 to 18 years could be made.  
Extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  adult  patients  to  the  paediatric  population  within  the  approved  adult 
indications was considered feasible by the CHMP, as: 
- 
The  microorganisms  involved  in  the  infections  covered  by  the  claimed  indication  are  similar  in 
adults  and  children.    Gram-positive  microorganisms  such  as  S.  aureus  and  streptococci  are  the 
main  cause  of  skin  and  soft  tissue  infections  in  children  and  adults.  Gram-negative 
microorganisms  and  anaerobes  are  the  main  pathogens  involved  in  complicated  intra-abdominal 
infection in both populations also.   
- 
The proposed dosing recommendations for the paediatric population result in a systemic exposure 
that is similar to that achieved by adult patients with a similar percent of target attainment.  
In  these  circumstances,  CHMP  agreed  that  only  PK  and  safety  studies  would  be  sufficient  for  granted  a 
restricted indication for this subgroup of the paediatric population.   
The  dosing  regimen  proposed  by  the  MAH  (1.2  mg/kg  every  12  h  for  children  aged  8  to  less  than  12 
years  and  50  mg  every  12h  for  children  12  to  less  than  18  years  old)  was  considered  adequate  by  the 
CHMP.     
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/245949/2015 
Page 32/35 
 
  
  
Extrapolation  of  efficacy  is  based  in  this  particular  case  on  two  approaches:  a  non-compartmental  PK 
analysis  of  the  data  of  study  2207  and  on  a  pop-PK  analysis  of  both  PK  paediatric  studies.  Both 
approaches  were  followed  by  simulations  of  several  dosing  regimens  in  the  age  range  of  interest  (8  to 
less than 18) to identify the dose that would provide a similar percent of target attainment as compared 
to adult patients.  
The  AUC0-24h  observed  in  adults  at  the  approved  dose  is  approximately  5.0  mg•h/L;  thus,  for  AUC  0-
12h, the target would be 2.5 mg•h/L. The value of the AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios that have been identified in 
adult  patients  are  ≥17.9  for  cSSTI  and  ≥6.96  for  cIAI.  For  cSSTI,  the  target  attainment  in  adults 
receiving the approved tigecycline dosing regimen of 100 mg followed by 50 mg q12h was estimated at 
57.0% of patients while for cIAI the percent of attainment was 82.4% of patients. The estimated percent 
of  target  attainment  for  children  aged  8  to  less  than  18  years  based  on  the  Monte-Carlo  simulation  is 
81.6%  for  complicated intra-abdominal infections  (cIAI)  and  54.5%  for  complicated  skin  and  soft tissue 
infections  (cSSTI)  for  the  proposed  dose  of  1.2  mg/kg  every  12  hours.  These  figures  for  model-based 
simulation of the same dose are 86.5% and 62.0% for children aged 8 to less than 12 years. For children 
aged 12 to less than 18 years, the percent of target attainment according to model-based simulations for 
the proposed dose of 50 mg every 12 hours were 87.4% and 64.1% for cIAI and cSSTIs, respectively.  
Therefore, pop-PK-PD model-based simulations of percent of target attainment led to higher estimates of 
paediatric  patients  at  or  above  the  adult  predefined  target.  It  can  be  discussed  whether  the  proposed 
dose of 1.2 mg/kg for children aged 8 to less than 12 years is appropriate or whether a lower dose such 
as 1 mg/kg may be more appropriate. In this respect CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal due to the 
fact  that  tigecycline  is  expected  to  be  used  for  the  treatment  of  serious  infections  in  children  when  no 
other  alternatives  can  be  used.  In  addition,  safety  of  tigecycline  can  be  easily  monitored  in  clinical 
practice.  Second,  because  the  residual  error  of  the  pop  PK  model  was  estimated  to  be  43.3%.  Such  a 
high value may have an impact in based-model simulations. 
The main set of efficacy data is that from study 2207 which included children with cIAI, cSSTI and with 
community acquired pneumonia. Efficacy results are provided descriptively. Clinical cure at TOC is higher 
for  the  lowest  dose  (0.75 mg/kg)  than  for  the  other  two.  However,  the  low  number  of  patients  and  the 
lack  of  standardisation  regarding  concomitant  antibiotic  therapy  (other  than  tigecycline)  may  have 
influenced the results (among others) and do not permit to draw appropriate conclusions.  
Based  on  the  data  presented  concerning  the  compassionate  use  and  use  reported  in  the  literature,  it 
appears  that  most  of  the  paediatric  use  is  outside  of  the  approved  indications  in  adults  (bacteraemia, 
cystic  fibrosis,  meningitis,  pneumonia)  and  across  all  paediatric  age  subsets  (the  youngest  child  treated 
with  tigecycline  was  a  2.5-month-old  child).  The  outcomes  differ  according  to  the  indication  in  which 
tigecycline  is  used  but  are  indicative  that  tigecycline  has  the  potential  for  treating  serious  infections 
where  other  alternatives  are  not  available  or  have  failed.  The  review  of  these  data  also  shows  that 
tigecycline is usually administered in combination with other antibiotics.  
From  a  safety  perspective,  the  review  of  the  data  does  not  raise  concern  in  the  sense  that  the  safety 
profile  seems  to  be  similar  to  that  of  adult  patients  in  terms  of  the  type  of  adverse  events  reported. 
However, it is unclear whether some adverse reactions have been more frequently reported by children. 
The wording of section 4.8 has been amended by the MAH and the frequency of nausea and vomiting is 
provided suggesting that this is the only relevant difference in safety between adults and children.  
The main uncertainties related to the present submission refer to the PK-PD model assumptions that may 
affect  the  accuracy  of  model-based  simulations  and  to  the  fact  that  the  proposed  doses  have  not  been 
tested  in  a  sufficient  number  of  paediatric  patients  with  the  infections  of  interest.  CHMP  agreed  that, 
despite the fact that efficacy and safety data were limited, the proposed dose was in the range of those 
studied in study 2207 and has been shown to produce a number of adverse events (in particular, nausea

and vomiting) in a high percentage of the treated patients. Nausea and vomiting were, however, of mild 
to moderate severity in most cases.   
It  was  also  acknowledged  that  Tygacil  was  expected  to  be  used  only  in  children  for  the  treatment  of 
serious infections caused by microorganisms resistant to other, more commonly used antibiotics.  CHMP 
agreed that in these cases it was highly desirable that dosing recommendations were made available to 
guide  the  prescriber.  CHMP  also  agreed  to  update  other  sections  of  the  Tygacil  SmPC  with  information 
relevant to the use of tigecycline in the paediatric population.   
CHMP  considered  that  the  overall  benefit-risk  of  tigecycline  for  children  aged  8  to  less  than  18  years  is 
positive for the indications claimed.  
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  variation  acceptable  and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of Indication to include the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 years to <18 
years of age for Tygacil. 
As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0292/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include the restricted use of Tygacil in paediatric patients ≥8 years to <18 
years of age for Tygacil. 
As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance.

Summary 
This  is  an  extension  of  indication  for  the  restricted  use  of  Tygacil  (tigecycline)  in  paediatric  patients  ≥8 
years  to  <18  years  of  age.  The  agreed  indications  for  tigecycline  in  children  are  the  same  as  those 
approved  for  adult  patients.  This  decision  was  based  on  data  two  paediatric  PK  studies,  an  ascending 
single-dose study in subjects 8 to 16 years of age recovering from infections (study 110), and a multiple-
dose  study  in  patients  8  to  11  years  with  cSSTI,  cIAI,  or  community-acquired  pneumonia  (study  2207) 
supported by data from children who received tigecycline in the setting of compassionate use, data on the 
paediatric  use  reported  in  the  literature  and  data  from  a  summary  of  the  microbiology  data  from  the 
Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) of pathogens isolated from children 8 to <18 years of 
age.

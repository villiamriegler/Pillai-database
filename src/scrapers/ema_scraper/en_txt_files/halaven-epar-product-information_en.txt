CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
HALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease (see 
section 5.1). Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or 
metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. 
HALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma who have 
received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease 
(see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
HALAVEN should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in the appropriate use of 
anti-cancer therapy. It should be administered by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional 
only. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of eribulin as the ready to use solution is 1.23 mg/m2 which should be 
administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle.  
Please note: 
In the EU the recommended dose refers to the base of the active substance (eribulin). Calculation of 
the individual dose to be administered to a patient must be based on the strength of the ready to use 
solution that contains 0.44 mg/ml eribulin and the dose recommendation of 1.23 mg/m2. The dose 
reduction recommendations shown below are also shown as the dose of eribulin to be administered 
based on the strength of the ready to use solution. 
In the pivotal trials, the corresponding publications and in some other regions e.g. the United States 
and Switzerland, the recommended dose is based on the salt form (eribulin mesilate). 
Patients may experience nausea or vomiting. Antiemetic prophylaxis including corticosteroids should 
be considered.

0.62 mg/m2 
Consider discontinuation 
The dose of eribulin should not be re-escalated after it has been reduced. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Impaired liver function due to metastases 
The recommended dose of eribulin in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) is 
0.97 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The 
recommended dose of eribulin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 
0.62 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. 
Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) has not been studied but it is expected that a more marked 
dose reduction is needed if eribulin is used in these patients. 
Impaired liver function due to cirrhosis 
This patient group has not been studied. The doses above may be used in mild and moderate 
impairment but close monitoring is advised as the doses may need readjustment. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Some patients with moderately or severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min) 
may have increased eribulin exposure and may need a reduction of the dose. For all patients with renal 
impairment, caution and close safety monitoring is advised. (See section 5.2)  
Elderly patients 
No specific dose adjustments are recommended based on the age of the patient (see section 4.8).

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of HALAVEN in children and adolescents for the indication of breast cancer.  
There is no relevant use of HALAVEN in the paediatric population for the indication of soft tissue 
sarcoma (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
HALAVEN is for intravenous use. The dose may be diluted in up to 100 ml of sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. It should not be diluted in glucose 5% infusion solution. For 
instructions on the dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Good 
peripheral venous access, or a patent central line, should be ensured prior to administration. There is 
no evidence that eribulin mesilate is a vesicant or an irritant. In the event of extravasation, treatment 
should be symptomatic. For information relevant to the handling of cytotoxic medicinal products see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Breast-feeding 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematology 
Myelosuppression is dose dependent and primarily manifested as neutropenia (section 4.8). 
Monitoring of complete blood counts should be performed on all patients prior to each dose of 
eribulin. Treatment with eribulin should only be initiated in patients with ANC values ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and 
platelets > 100 x 109/l.  
Febrile neutropenia occurred in < 5% of patients treated with eribulin. Patients experiencing febrile 
neutropenia, severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, should be treated according to the 
recommendations in section 4.2. 
Patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3 x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. 
Although data are limited, patients with bilirubin >1.5 x ULN also have a higher incidence of Grade 4 
neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.  
Fatal cases of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis and septic shock have been reported. 
Severe neutropenia may be managed by the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or 
equivalent at the physician’s discretion in accordance with relevant guidelines (see section 5.1). 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Patients should be closely monitored for signs of peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy. The 
development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a delay or reduction of dose (see section 4.2) 
In clinical trials, patients with pre-existing neuropathy greater than Grade 2 were excluded. However, 
patients with pre-existing neuropathy Grade 1 or 2 were no more likely to develop new or worsening 
symptoms than those who entered the study without the condition.

QT prolongation 
In an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, 
independent of eribulin concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1. ECG monitoring 
is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or 
concomitant treatment with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia 
and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or 
hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to initiating HALAVEN and these electrolytes should be 
monitored periodically during therapy. Eribulin should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT 
syndrome. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Eribulin is mainly (up to 70%) eliminated through biliary excretion. The transport protein involved in 
this process is unknown. Eribulin is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic 
anion (OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3), multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP2, 
MRP4) and bile salt export pump (BSEP) transporters.  
No drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Eribulin exposure 
(AUC and Cmax) was unaffected by ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and P glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitor, and 
rifampicin, a CYP3A4 inducer.  
Effects of eribulin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicines 
In vitro data indicate that eribulin is a mild inhibitor of the important drug metabolising enzyme 
CYP3A4. No in vivo data are available. Caution and monitoring for adverse events is recommended 
with concomitant use of substances that have a narrow therapeutic window and that are eliminated 
mainly via CYP3A4-mediated metabolism (e.g. alfentanil, cyclosporine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus). 
Eribulin does not inhibit the CYP enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 2E1 at relevant 
clinical concentrations. 
At relevant clinical concentrations, eribulin did not inhibit BCRP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter-mediated activity. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of eribulin in pregnant women. Eribulin is embryotoxic, foetotoxic, and 
teratogenic in rats. HALAVEN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after 
a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid becoming pregnant whilst they or their 
male partner are receiving HALAVEN and have to use effective contraception during and up to 3 
months after treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether eribulin/metabolites are excreted in human or animal breast milk. A risk to 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded and therefore HALAVEN must not be used during 
breast-feeding (see section 4.3).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Testicular toxicity has been observed in rats and dogs (see section 5.3). Male patients should seek 
advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility 
due to therapy with HALAVEN. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
HALAVEN may cause adverse reactions such as tiredness and dizziness which may lead to minor or 
moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive or 
use machines if they feel tired or dizzy. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions related to HALAVEN, are bone marrow suppression 
manifested as neutropenia, leucopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia with associated infections. New 
onset or worsening of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy has also been reported. Gastrointestinal 
toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and stomatitis are among 
reported undesirable effects. Other undesirable effects include fatigue, alopecia, increased liver 
enzymes, sepsis and musculoskeletal pain syndrome. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Unless  otherwise  noted,  the  table  shows  the  incidence  rates  of  adverse  reactions  observed  in  breast 
cancer and soft tissue sarcoma  patients who received the recommended dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies.  
Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000).  
Within  each  frequency  grouping,  undesirable  effects  are  presented  in  order  of  decreasing  frequency. 
Where Grade 3 or 4 reactions occurred, the actual total frequency and the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 
reactions are given.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia 
The neutropenia observed was reversible and not cumulative; the mean time to nadir was 13 days and 
the mean time to recovery from severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/l) was 8 days. 
Neutrophil counts of < 0.5 x 109/l that lasted for more than 7 days occurred in 13% of breast cancer 
patients treated with eribulin in the EMBRACE study. 
Neutropenia was reported as a Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) in 151/404 (37.4% for all 
grades) in the sarcoma population, compared with 902/1559 (57.9% for all grades) in the breast cancer 
population. The combined grouped TEAE and neutrophil laboratory abnormality frequencies were 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
307/404 (76.0%) and 1314/1559 (84.3%), respectively. The median duration of treatment was 12.0 
weeks for sarcoma patients and 15.9 weeks for breast cancer patients. 
Fatal cases of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis and septic shock have been reported. Out 
of 1963 breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma patients who received eribulin at the recommended dose 
in clinical trials there was one fatal event each of neutropenic sepsis (0.1%) and febrile neutropenia 
(0.1%). In addition there were 3 fatal events of sepsis (0.2%) and one of septic shock (0.1%). 
Severe neutropenia may be managed by the use of G-CSF or equivalent at the physician’s discretion in 
accordance with relevant guidelines. 18% and 13% of eribulin treated patients received G-CSF in the 
two phase 3 breast cancer studies (Studies 305 and 301, respectively). In the phase 3 sarcoma study 
(Study 309), 26% of the eribulin treated patients received G-CSF. 
Neutropenia resulted in discontinuation in < 1% of patients receiving eribulin.  
Disseminated intravascular coagulation 
Cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported, typically in association with 
neutropenia and/or sepsis. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
In the 1559 breast cancer patients the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of 
treatment with eribulin was peripheral neuropathy (3.4%). The median time to Grade 2 peripheral 
neuropathy was 12.6 weeks (post 4 cycles). Out of the 404 sarcoma patients, 2 patients discontinued 
treatment with eribulin due to peripheral neuropathy. The median time to Grade 2 peripheral 
neuropathy was 18.4 weeks.  
Development of Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7.4% of breast cancer patients and 
3.5% of sarcoma patients. In clinical trials, patients with pre-existing neuropathy were as likely to 
develop new or worsening symptoms as those who entered the study without the condition. 
In breast cancer patients with pre-existing Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy the frequency of 
treatment-emergent Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 14%. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In some patients with normal/abnormal liver enzymes prior treatment with eribulin, increased levels of 
liver enzymes have been reported with initiation of eribulin treatment. Such elevations appeared to 
have occurred early with eribulin treatment in cycle 1 – 2 for the majority of these patients and whilst 
thought likely to be a phenomenon of adaptation to eribulin treatment by the liver and not a sign of 
significant liver toxicity in most patients, hepatotoxicity has also been reported. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
Of the 1559 breast cancer patients treated with the recommended dose of eribulin, 283 patients 
(18.2%) were ≥ 65 years of age. In the 404 sarcoma patient population, 90 patients (22.3%) treated 
with eribulin were ≥ 65 years of age. The safety profile of eribulin in elderly patients (≥ 65 years of 
age) was similar to that of patients <65 years of age except for asthenia/fatigue which showed an 
increasing trend with age. No dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly population. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Patients with ALT or AST > 3 x ULN experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and 
febrile neutropenia. Although data are limited, patients with bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN also have a higher 
incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
Three open-label studies, Studies 113, 213 and 223, were conducted in paediatric patients with 
refractory or recurrent solid tumours and lymphomas, but excluding central nervous system (CNS) 
tumours (see section 5.1).  
The safety of eribulin monotherapy was evaluated in 43 paediatric patients who received up to 
1.58 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Studies 113 and 223). The safety of eribulin in 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combination with irinotecan was also evaluated in 40 paediatric patients who received eribulin 
1.23 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 and irinotecan 20 or 40 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle, or 100 
or 125 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Study 213).  
In Study 113 (Phase 1), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were white blood cell 
count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, anaemia and neutrophil count decreased.  
In Study 213 (Phase 1/2), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were neutropenia 
(Phase 1) and diarrhoea and neutrophil count decreased (Phase 2).  
In Study 223 (Phase 2), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were neutrophil count 
decreased, anaemia, and white blood cell count decreased.  
The safety profile of eribulin as monotherapy or in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride in this 
paediatric population was consistent with the known safety profile of either study drug in the adult 
population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In one case of overdose the patient inadvertently received 7.6 mg of eribulin (approximately 4 times 
the planned dose) and subsequently developed a hypersensitivity reaction (Grade 3) on Day 3 and 
neutropenia (Grade 3) on Day 7. Both adverse reactions resolved with supportive care. 
There is no known antidote for eribulin overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be 
closely monitored. Management of overdose should include supportive medical interventions to treat 
the presenting clinical manifestations.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX41 
Eribulin mesilate is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor belonging to the halichondrin class of 
antineoplastic agents. It is a structurally simplified synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a natural 
product isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. 
Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and 
sequesters tubulin into non-productive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based 
antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, 
ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockage.  
Clinical efficacy 
Breast cancer 
The efficacy of HALAVEN in breast cancer is primarily supported by two randomized Phase 3 
comparative studies.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 762 patients in the pivotal Phase 3 EMBRACE study (Study 305) had locally recurrent or 
metastatic breast cancer, and had previously received at least two and a maximum of five 
chemotherapy regimens, including an anthracycline and a taxane (unless contraindicated). Patients 
must have progressed within 6 months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen. The HER2 status of the 
patients was: 16.1% positive, 74.2% negative and 9.7% unknown, whilst 18.9% of patients were triple 
negative. They were randomized 2:1 to receive either HALAVEN, or treatment of physician’s choice 
(TPC), which consisted of 97% chemotherapy (26% vinorelbine, 18% gemcitabine, 18% capecitabine, 
16% taxane, 9% anthracycline, 10% other chemotherapy), or 3% hormonal therapy. 
The study met its primary endpoint with an overall survival (OS) result that was statistically

By independent review, the median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.7 months for eribulin 
compared to 2.2 months for the TPC arm (HR 0.865, 95% CI: 0.714, 1.048, p=0.137). In response 
evaluable patients, the objective response rate by the RECIST criteria was 12.2% (95% CI: 9.4%, 
15.5%) by independent review for the eribulin arm compared to 4.7% (95% CI: 2.3%, 8.4%) for the 
TPC arm.  
The positive effect on OS was seen in both taxane-refractory and non-refractory groups of patients . In 
the OS update, the HR for eribulin versus TPC was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14) in favour of eribulin for 
taxane-refractory patients and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.96) for patients not taxane-refractory.  
The positive effect on OS was seen both in capecitabine-naïve and in capecitabine pre-treated patient 
groups. The updated OS analysis showed a survival benefit for the eribulin group compared to TPC 
both in capecitabine pre-treated patients with a HR of 0.787 (95% CI: 0.645, 0.961), and for the 
capecitabine-naïve patients with a corresponding HR of 0.865 (95% CI: 0.606, 1.233).  
The second Phase 3 study in earlier line metastatic breast cancer, Study 301, was an open-label, 
randomized, study in patients (n=1102) with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer to 
investigate the efficacy of HALAVEN monotherapy compared to capecitabine monotherapy in terms 
of OS and PFS as co-primary endpoint. Patients had previously received up to three prior 
chemotherapy regimens, including both an anthracycline and a taxane and a maximum of two for

advanced disease, with the percentage who had received 0, 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy treatments for 
metastatic breast cancer being 20.0%, 52.0% or 27.2% respectively. The HER2 status of the patients 
was: 15.3% positive, 68.5% negative and 16.2% unknown, whilst 25.8% of patients were triple 
negative.

Progression free survival assessed by independent review was similar between eribulin and 
capecitabine with medians of 4.1 months vs 4.2 months (HR 1.08; [95% CI: 0.932, 1.250]) 
respectively. Objective response rate as assessed by independent review was also similar between 
eribulin and capecitabine; 11.0% (95% CI: 8.5, 13.9) in the eribulin group and 11.5% (95% CI: 8.9, 
14.5) in the capecitabine group.

Liposarcoma 
In liposarcoma the efficacy of eribulin is supported by the pivotal Phase 3 sarcoma study (Study 309). 
The patients in this study (n=452) had locally recurrent, inoperable and/or metastatic soft tissue 
sarcoma of one of two subtypes – leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma. Patients had received at least two 
prior chemotherapy regimens, one of which must have been an anthracycline (unless contraindicated). 
Patients must have progressed within 6 months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen. They were 
randomized 1:1 to receive either eribulin 1.23 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle or dacarbazine 
850 mg/m2, 1000 mg/m2 or 1200 mg/m2 (dose determined by the investigator prior to randomization), 
every 21 days. 
In Study 309, a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed in patients randomized to the 
eribulin arm compared to the control arm. This translated into a 2 month improvement in median OS 
(13.5 months for eribulin treated patients vs. 11.5 months for dacarbazine treated patients). There was 
no significant difference in progression-free survival or overall response rate between the treatment 
arms in the overall population. 
Treatment effects of eribulin were limited to patients with liposarcoma (45% dedifferentiated, 37% 
myxoid/round cell and 18% pleomorphic in Study 309) based on pre-planned subgroup analyses of OS 
and PFS. There was no difference in efficacy between eribulin and dacarbazine in patients with 
advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma.

Paediatric population 
Breast Cancer 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
eribulin in all subsets of the paediatric population in the indication of breast cancer (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
Soft Tissue Sarcoma 
Efficacy of eribulin was assessed but not established in three open-label studies:  
Study 113 was a Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, dose-finding study that assessed eribulin in 
paediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumours and lymphomas but excluding CNS 
tumours. A total of 22 paediatric patients (age range: 3 to 17 years) were enrolled and treated. The 
patients were administered eribulin intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle at three dose 
levels (0.97, 1.23 and 1.58 mg/m2). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of eribulin was determined as 1.23 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. 
Study 223 was a Phase 2, open-label, multicentre study that assessed the safety and preliminary 
activity of eribulin in paediatric patients with refractory or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), 
non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) or Ewing sarcoma (EWS). Twenty-one 
paediatric patients (age range: 2 to 17 years) were enrolled and treated with eribulin at a dose of 
1.23 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (the RP2D from Study 113). No patient 
achieved confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR).  
Study 213 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eribulin 
in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride in paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory solid 
tumours and lymphomas but excluding CNS tumours (Phase 1), and to assess the efficacy of the 
combination treatment in paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory RMS, NRSTS and EWS 
(Phase 2). A total of 40 paediatric patients were enrolled and treated in this study. In Phase 1, 
13 paediatric patients (age range: 4 to 17 years) were enrolled and treated; the RP2D was determined 
as eribulin 1.23 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 with irinotecan hydrochloride 40 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 5 of a 
21-day cycle. In Phase 2, 27 paediatric patients (age range: 4 to 17 years) were enrolled and treated at 
the RP2D. Three patients had confirmed PR (1 patient in each of the RMS, NRSTS, and EWS 
histology cohorts). The objective response rate (ORR) was 11.1%.  
No new safety signals were observed in the three paediatric studies (see section 4.8); however, due to 
the small patient populations no firm conclusions can be made. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
The pharmacokinetics of eribulin are characterized by a rapid distribution phase followed by a 
prolonged elimination phase, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 40 h. It has a large 
volume of distribution (range of means 43 to 114 l/m2).  
Eribulin is weakly bound to plasma proteins. The plasma protein binding of eribulin (100-1000 ng/ml) 
ranged from 49% to 65% in human plasma.  
Biotransformation  
Unchanged eribulin was the major circulating species in plasma following administration of 14C-
eribulin to patients. Metabolite concentrations represented <0.6% of parent compound, confirming that 
there are no major human metabolites of eribulin. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Eribulin has a low clearance (range of means 1.16 to 2.42 l/h/m2). No significant accumulation of 
eribulin is observed on weekly administration. The pharmacokinetic properties are not dose or time 
dependent in the range of eribulin doses of 0.22 to 3.53 mg/m2.  
Eribulin is eliminated primarily by biliary excretion. The transport protein involved in the excretion is 
presently unknown. Preclinical in vitro studies indicate that eribulin is transported by Pgp. However it 
has been shown that at clinically relevant concentrations eribulin is not a Pgp inhibitor in vitro. 
Additionally, in vivo, concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a Pgp inhibitor, has no effect on 
eribulin exposure (AUC and Cmax). In vitro studies have also indicated that eribulin is not a substrate 
for OCT1. 
After administration of 14C-eribulin to patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in 
faeces and 9% in urine indicating that renal clearance is not a significant route of eribulin elimination. 
Unchanged eribulin represented most of the total radioactivity in faeces and urine. 
Hepatic impairment 
A study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of eribulin in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A; n=7) and 
moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=4) hepatic impairment due to liver metastases. Compared to patients with 
normal hepatic function (n=6), eribulin exposure increased 1.8-fold and 3-fold in patients with mild 
and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. Administration of HALAVEN at a dose of 0.97 mg/m2 
to patients with mild hepatic impairment and 0.62 mg/m2 to patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
resulted in a somewhat higher exposure than after a dose of 1.23 mg/m2 to patients with normal 
hepatic function. HALAVEN was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
C). There is no study in patients with hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. See section 4.2 for dosage 
recommendation.  
Renal impairment 
Increased eribulin exposure was seen in some patients with moderately or severely impaired renal 
function, with high between-subject variability. The pharmacokinetics of eribulin were evaluated in a 
Phase 1 study in patients with normal renal function (Creatinine clearance: ≥ 80 ml/min; n=6), 
moderate (30-50 ml/min; n=7) or severe (15-<30 ml/min; n=6) renal impairment. Creatinine clearance 
was estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. A 1.5-fold (90% CI: 0.9-2.5) higher dose-normalised 
AUC(0-inf) was observed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. See section 4.2 for 
treatment recommendations.  
Paediatric population 
Eribulin plasma concentrations were collected from 83 paediatric patients (age range: 2 to 17 years), 
with refractory/relapsed and recurrent solid tumours and lymphomas, who received eribulin in Studies 
113, 213 and 223. Eribulin PK in paediatric patients was comparable to adult patients with STS and 
patients with other types of tumour. Eribulin exposure in paediatric patients was similar to exposure in 
adult patients. Concomitant irinotecan did not have an effect on eribulin PK in paediatric patients with 
refractory/relapsed and recurrent solid tumours.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Eribulin was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). Eribulin was 
positive in the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay and was clastogenic in the in vivo rat 
micronucleus assay.  
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with eribulin. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A fertility study was not conducted with eribulin, but based on non-clinical findings in repeated-dose 
studies where testicular toxicity was observed in both rats (hypocellularity of seminiferous epithelium 
with hypospermia/aspermia) and dogs, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with eribulin. 
An embryofoetal development study in rat confirmed the developmental toxicity and teratogenic 
potential of eribulin. Pregnant rats were treated with eribulin mesilate equivalent to 0.009, 0.027, 
0.088 and 0.133 mg/kg eribulin at gestation days 8, 10 and 12. Dose related increased number of 
resorptions and decreased foetal weight were observed at doses ≥ 0.088 mg/kg and increased incidence 
of malformations (absence of lower jaw, tongue, stomach and spleen) was recorded at 0.133 mg/kg.

It is used in adults for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread 
beyond the original tumour) when at least one other therapy has been tried but has lost its effect.  
It is also used in adults for advanced or metastatic liposarcoma (a type of cancer that arises from fat 
tissue) when previous therapy has been tried but has lost its effect.

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
HALAVEN may cause serious birth defects and should not be used if you are pregnant unless it is 
thought clearly necessary after carefully considering all the risk to you and the baby. It may also cause 
future permanent fertility problems in men if they take it and they should discuss this with their doctor 
before starting treatment. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and up 
to 3 months after treatment with HALAVEN. 
HALAVEN must not be used during breast-feeding because of the possibility of risk to the child. 
Driving and using machines 
HALAVEN may cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common). Do not 
drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy. 
HALAVEN contains ethanol (alcohol) 
This medicine contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg in a vial. 
3. 
How to use HALAVEN 
HALAVEN will be given to you by a qualified healthcare professional as an injection into a vein, over 
a period of 2 to 5 minutes. The dose you will receive is based on your body surface area (expressed in 
squared metres, or m2) which is calculated from your weight and height. The usual dose of 
HALAVEN is 1.23 mg/m2, but this may be adjusted by your doctor based on your blood test results or 
other factors. To ensure that the whole dose of HALAVEN is given it is recommended that a saline 
solution is flushed into the vein after HALAVEN is given. 
How often will you be given HALAVEN? 
HALAVEN is usually given on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. Your doctor will determine how 
many cycles of treatment you should receive. Depending on the results of your blood tests, the doctor 
may need to delay administration of the medicine until the blood tests return to normal. The doctor 
may also then decide to reduce the dose you are given. 
If you have any further questions about the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

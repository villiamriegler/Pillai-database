2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China 
and has rapidly spread around the world by human to human transmission. In December 2019, a 
pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, it became clear 
that a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause. In early January 2020, the genetic 
sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and public, and 
the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus subfamily. By sequence analysis, the phylogenetic 
tree revealed a closer relationship to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus isolates than to 
other coronaviruses that infect humans, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 
coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting disease COVID-19 have spread globally, affecting 
a growing number of countries. On 11 March 2020 the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a 
pandemic. As of 01 December 2020, there have been >63 million globally confirmed COVID-19 cases 
and >1.4 million deaths, with 191 countries/regions affected. 
At the time of this marketing application submission, confirmed cases and mortality continue to rise 
globally. The ongoing pandemic remains a significant challenge to public health and economic stability 
worldwide.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Every individual is at risk of infection as there is no pre-existing immunity to the SARS-CoV-2. 
Following infection some but not all individuals develop protective immunity in terms of neutralising 
antibody responses and cell mediated immunity. However, it is currently unknown to what extent and 
for how long this protection lasts.   
According to WHO 80% of infected individuals recover without need for hospital care, while 15% 
develop more severe disease and 5% need intensive care.  
Increasing age and underlying medical conditions are considered risk factors for developing severe 
disease. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the Spike protein is a surface 
protein which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host cells. Therefore, the 
Spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development. It has been shown that 
antibodies against the Spike protein neutralise the virus and prevent infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 11/140 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
The presentation of COVID-19 is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing 
ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or 
radiographic changes, and infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling 
transmission. For symptomatic subjects, progression of disease may lead to acute respiratory distress 
syndrome requiring ventilation and subsequent multi-organ failure and death. 
Common symptoms in hospitalized patients (in order of highest to lowest frequency) include fever, dry 
cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, nausea/vomiting or diarrhoea, headache, weakness, and 
rhinorrhoea. Anosmia (loss of smell) or ageusia (loss of taste) may be the sole presenting symptom in 
approximately 3% of individuals who have COVID-19. 
The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID-19 symptoms as including 1 
or more of the following: 
•  Fever 
•  New or increased cough 
•  New or increased shortness of breath 
•  Chills 
•  New or increased muscle pain 
•  New loss of taste or smell 
•  Sore throat 
•  Diarrheal 
•  Vomiting 
•  Fatigue 
•  Headache 
•  Nasal congestion or runny nose 
•  Nausea 
All ages may present with the disease, but notably case fatality rates (CFR) are elevated in persons 
>60 years of age. For example, in Italy the CFR was 0.3% in adults <40 years of age but 12.8% in 
adults 70 to 79 years of age and 20.2% in patients ≥80 years of age. Comorbidities are also 
associated with increased CFR, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic 
respiratory disease. Healthcare workers are overrepresented among COVID-19 patients due to 
occupational exposure to infected patients. 
In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. The reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test methods targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA are 
the gold standard in vitro methods for diagnosing suspected cases of COVID-19. Samples to be tested 
are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular methods used to confirm an active 
infection are usually performed within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may 
begin.

2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 has developed during 2020, and now includes antiviral therapy (e.g. 
remdesivir), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins, 
anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and statins, targeted immunomodulatory agents and 
anticoagulants. These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration 
of illness, with different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease.  
While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an 
urgent and unmet medical need for a prophylactic vaccine during the ongoing pandemic, both for 
protection of particularly vulnerable groups as well as mitigating the effects of the pandemic at a 
population level, e.g. to maintain a functioning health care system, and to avoid the social and 
economic consequences of the stringent measures needed to diminish virus spread. There is currently 
no approved vaccine in EU for prevention of COVID-19. 
About the product 
BNT162b is a mRNA vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. The vaccine is made of a mRNA encoding for 
the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The 
sequence of the S protein was chosen based on the sequence for the “SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-
1”, which was available when the program was initiated: GenBank: MN908947.3 (complete genome) 
and GenBank: QHD43416.1 (spike surface glycoprotein).  
The active substance consists of a single-stranded, 5'-capped mRNA that is translated into a codon-
optimized sequence encoding the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The RNA contains common structural 
elements optimized for mediating high RNA stability and translational efficiency (see section 2.2). The 
LNPs protect the RNA from degradation by RNAses and enable transfection of host cells after 
intramuscular (IM) delivery. 
The mRNA is translated into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the host cell cytosol. The S protein is then 
expressed on the cell surface where it induces an adaptive immune response. The S protein is 
identified as a target for neutralising antibodies against the virus and is therefore considered a relevant 
vaccine component.  
The vaccine, BNT162b2 (30 µg), is administered intramuscularly (IM) in two 30 µg doses of the diluted 
vaccine solution given 21 days apart.  
Intended indication: ‘Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, 
in individuals 16 years of age and older’.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive: 
According to the Applicant, there is a positive benefit-risk balance for Comirnaty in the active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 16 years of age and 
older. This is based on evidence from the pivotal study C4591001 (also referred to as BNT162-02), a 
Phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding Study investigating the 
safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-COV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidates Against 
COVID-19 in healthy individuals.

The Applicant stated that the available data to date indicate that its vaccine was 95 percent effective 
and had no serious side effects, showing that the vaccine prevented mild and severe forms of COVID-
19. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The Applicant intends to continue the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study with participants as originally 
allocated for as long as possible, to obtain long-term data and to ensure sufficient follow-up to support 
a standard marketing authorisation. In case of availability of any COVID-19 vaccine, the sponsor will 
appeal to participants to remain in the ongoing study as originally randomized for as long as possible, 
ideally until a COVID-19 vaccine has full regulatory approval. In all cases, it is intended to follow 
participants up to the original planned 24 months post-vaccination, regardless of any participants 
opting to crossover from placebo to active vaccination. The safety and effectiveness of COMIRNATY in 
individuals <16 years of age have not been established for this application. Four studies in paediatric 
subjects are planned as laid down in the paediatric investigation plan. A study in pregnant women is 
also planned in the EU. A Post-Approval Active Surveillance Safety Study to Monitor Real-World Safety 
of Comirnaty (Study C4591010) will be conducted in the EU using primary data collection that 
monitors a cohort of vaccinees and evaluates risk of AESIs. The Applicant will also conduct, non-
interventional studies (test negative design) of individuals presenting to the hospital or emergency 
room with symptoms of potential COVID-19 in a real-world setting. These studies will allow to 
determine the effectiveness of vaccine in a real-world setting and against severe disease, and in 
specific racial, ethnic, and age groups. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed 
According to the Applicant, as there is no approved other vaccine in the EU or successful COVID-19 
therapy available in the EU, unmet medical need is existing and is likely to be addressed by this 
vaccine in view of the high level of protection observed in the pivotal clinical trial. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
According to the Applicant, Efficacy of COMIRNATY to prevent COVID-19 was demonstrated at the final 
analysis. The observed VE in each subgroup as defined by age, including elderly ≥ 65 years old, sex, 
race/ethnicity, country, obese subjects, and subjects at risk due to comorbidities, was overall 
consistent with the effectiveness of BNT162b2 to protect vaccinees against the disease. The benefit of 
immediate availability of Comirnaty through conditional marketing authorisation is based on the fact 
that there is no approved vaccine or successful COVID-19 therapy available in the European Union. An 
effective vaccine can impact the pandemic at this critical time and a COVID-19 vaccination program 
implemented soon can likely prevent further pandemic waves and thus substantially reduce mortality 
due to disease.

30 micrograms of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance consists of a single-stranded, 5'-capped mRNA that is translated into a codon-
optimised sequence encoding the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the spike 
glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. The sequence was chosen based on the sequence for the “Severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1”. The protein sequence contains two 
proline mutation, which ensures an antigenically optimal pre-fusion confirmation (P2 S). The RNA does 
not contain any uridines; instead of uridine the modified N1-methylpseudouridine is used in RNA 
synthesis. The applicant will provide clarification on the mechanism of action for BNT162b2. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturers 
The active substance is manufactured and controlled by either Wyeth BioPharma Division, Andover, 
United States or by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, Mainz, Germany, and Rentschler Biopharma SE, 
Laupheim, Germany.  
During the procedure, a number of issues were highlighted relating to the GMP status of the manufacture 
of the active substance and of the testing sites of the finished product for the purpose of batch release. 
These issues were classified as a Major Objection (MO). After further information was obtained from the 
sites and inspectors, the MO was considered resolved. 
EU GMP certificates for the manufacturing and testing sites were subsequently obtained. In conclusion, 
appropriate manufacturing authorisations and GMP certificates are in place for all active substance and 
finished product manufacturing sites. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Information on the manufacturing process and process controls for both the Andover and the BNT 
Mainz & Rentschler manufacturing sites were provided.  
The manufacturing process of BNT162b2 active substance involves five major steps. The RNA is 
synthesised from linear DNA via an in vitro transcription (IVT) step. The IVT step is followed by a 
number of purification and filtration steps. Lastly, the RNA undergoes a final filtration before being 
dispensed and stored frozen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 15/140 
 
 
 
Flow diagrams were provided, presenting the process steps, process inputs and the process controls 
for each step. The purpose of each step in the manufacturing process is sufficiently described. The 
ranges of hold times and process parameters and routine in-process controls are listed with 
corresponding acceptance criteria, for each step. It is noted that not all process parameters are listed, 
but that the lists include all critical and several non-critical process parameters. It is agreed that the 
key process parameters are described in the dossier. The applicant has agreed to upgrade these 
parameters to critical process parameters (CPPs) and to include acceptable ranges for these CPPs. 
Updated information has been submitted during the procedure which comprised modifications of the 
acceptable ranges of several process parameters and the addition of some controls. The strategy is 
found acceptable, and the Applicant will provide information on acceptable ranges for some 
parameters. 
The active substance is stored between -15°C and -25°C. Transportation using an insulated shipper is 
qualified and shipping time to finished product manufacturing sites are defined.  Shipping validation of 
the intermediate has been agreed as recommendation. 
The batch numbering system is sufficiently described.  
Control of materials 
An adequate overview of the raw materials and solutions used in the active substance manufacturing 
process is provided.  
Representative certificates of analysis have been provided. The submitted information supports the 
appropriate quality of raw materials. It is recommended that the applicant should implement relevant 
testing strategies to ensure an adequate microbiological control for the starting materials (REC1) and 
should implement a relevant testing strategy to ensure that HEPES (Pfizer) raw material, included in 
the formulation buffer of FP, is free from contaminating RNases (REC2). The description of synthesis 
of 5’cap and its related impurities were requested during the procedure. Appropriate information was 
given. The applicant should implement in-house functional activity analytical methods for release 
testing of enzymes used in the manufacturing process at all relevant manufacturing sites, by Q1 2021 
(REC3). 
The BNT162b2 active substance is manufactured by in vitro transcription using a linear DNA template, 
produced via plasmid DNA from transformed Escherichia coli cells. 
The linear DNA template is not part of the final product but defines the sequence of the mRNA product 
and therefore it is fundamental to ensure the adequate control of the active substance. Changes to the 
manufacturing process of the linear DNA template (e.g. change to plasmid host cell) may result in a 
different impurity profile in the active substance. Additional details on the manufacturing process and 
the control strategy for this starting material, initially only shortly described, have been provided and 
the dossier will be updated accordingly.  
The cell banks involved in the plasmid manufacturing process are described. Master cell bank (MCB) 
and working cell bank (WCB) qualification tests are listed. Relevant specifications are set and data 
from the current MCB and WCB are provided. The plasmid MCBs and WCBs are enrolled in a cell bank 
stability program. The strategy is considered adequate, noting that the dossier will be updated as 
appropriate. A protocol for establishment of future WCBs is provided. 
Following fermentation, the cells are harvested and chemically lysed to recover the plasmid DNA.  After 
this lysis step, the circular plasmid DNA is purified. The circular plasmid DNA is filtered and stored 
frozen. The strategy for establishing the initial shelf-life is endorsed and data provided support the 
proposed shelf life. A list of the raw materials as well as other materials used in the manufacture of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 16/140 
 
 
 
linear DNA template is provided. All materials used are animal origin free and sourced from approved 
suppliers. 
Specifications for the circular plasmid DNA as well as for the DNA linear template are provided. 
Process- and product-related impurities including host cell genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins, 
bioburden and plasmid isoforms, for the plasmid DNA, are routinely quantified. The reference material 
is described. Implementation of any changes in the manufacture of the linear DNA template should be 
applied for in a variation application.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process parameters and tests that are used to control the process and active substance quality are 
provided. The list of CPPs was provided with corresponding updated acceptable ranges. 
A summary of the quality attributes with the rationale for the criticality assignment is provided. The 
rationale for classification into CQA or QA is presented for each attribute and appears reasonable. 
The in-process test methods are defined and described in the dossier. 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational 
parameters and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
Process validation 
The BNT162b2 active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency in 
production has been shown on full scale commercial process validation/ process performance 
qualification batches at all sites. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and 
acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process 
consistently produces active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined 
specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
In comparability studies, a decrease in RNA integrity was observed for the initial Process 2 batches 
compared to Process 1 batches. This is further discussed in the subsequent section on manufacturing 
process development. After adjustment of process parameters for CTP and ATP volumes, RNA integrity 
level is more consistent and verify that the volume adjustments made for ATP and CTP volumes 
consistently provide reproducible results with RNA integrity levels more similar to levels achieved in 
Process 1 batches. Since the target volumes for ATP and CTP have been increased, the proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) ranges need to be adjusted and the dossier updated accordingly (REC8). 
The robustness of the DNase digestion step is not considered comprehensively demonstrated although 
there is routine control of residual DNA impurities at the active substance level. It has been confirmed 
that studies to enhance the robustness of this step are ongoing and these should be reported (REC7). 
The finalised indirect filter qualification assessment, according to the applicant, already available and 
should be provided for evaluation (REC6).  
Relevant hold times and transport times have been defined and were validated by appropriate studies.  
The shipping qualification strategy is described in detail and considers both thermal and mechanical 
aspects of shipping. The shipping procedures and configuration for transport of frozen AS to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020

finished product manufacturing sites were validated to maintain product temperature in the acceptable 
range for a defined duration.  
A transport verification study is planned and results will be available in Q1/2021. The recommendation 
to provide shipping performance qualification data has been agreed (REC6). 
Manufacturing process development 
Process development changes were adequately summarised. Two active substance processes have 
been used during the development history; Process 1 (clinical trial material) and Process 2 
(commercial process). Details about process differences, justification for making changes, and results 
from a comparability study are provided. The major changes between active substance process 
versions were described in the dossier.  
Batch analysis results showing comparability between non-clinical and clinical batches are provided.  
Additional characterization of product-related species and their relation to final product specifications 
will be provided as a specific obligation. 
Electropherograms were presented demonstrating similarities in the peak pattern of RNA species, but 
some differences between Process 1 and 2 were also noted. It can therefore not be concluded that 
identical species are obtained by the processes. It is likely that the fragmented species will not result in 
expressed proteins, due to their expected poor stability and poor translational efficiency (see below). 
However, the lack of experimental data on the truncated RNA and expressed proteins does not permit 
a definitive conclusion and needs further characterisation. Therefore, additional characterisation data 
remain to be provided as a specific obligation (SO1). 
Regarding the 5’ cap end of the AS, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-UV and 
mass spectrometry (LC- UV/MS) characterisation confirmed that the 5'-capped and uncapped 
structures are the same but that there is a slight shift towards higher 5'-capping levels in Process 2. 
The reported quality attribute ‘capped-intact RNA’ is intended to reflect the proportion of the RNA 
molecules in the active substance that are a fully intact molecule and have the 5’-cap. It is noted that 
the capped-intact RNA is not measured, but only calculated from the results of 5’-cap and %RNA 
integrity tests. Therefore, this argument alone cannot fully confirm the comparability of Process 2 
versus Process 1, and further characterisation data and justification of specifications were requested.  
According to the Applicant, the majority of fragments are expected to be comprised of truncated 
transcripts including the 5’ region but lacking the 3’ region and poly(A)tail. However, the results 
indicating a substantial proportion of shorter/truncated mRNA with both cap and poly(A)tail are not in 
agreement with this statement. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to discuss and justify the obtained 
results and explain the apparent discrepancy. Additional characterisation data using an orthogonal 
method with enriched samples for fragmented species was provided. Preliminary characterization data 
on isolated fragmented species suggests they predominantly include the 5’-cap but lack the poly(A) 
tail, supporting the hypothesis that most fragments would arise from premature termination in the IVT 
reaction. The characterisation data are requested to be completed with analysis of the main peak from 
ion pairing RP-HPLC and analysis of other samples from Process 1 and optimised Process 2 (SO1). The 
Applicant will continue to evaluate any potential overestimation of poly(A) tail and should characterise 
fragments for any future AS process changes (SO1). 
Furthermore, the poly(A)tail of the 3’ end was characterised by LC-UV/MS. While the results were 
demonstrated to be comparable between Process 1 and Process 2 batches, significant differences were 
identified. As expected, poly(A) tail heterogeneity was observed both for Process 1 and Process 2 
batches. Thus, slight differences in the poly(A)tail pattern were observed when comparing Process 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 18/140 
 
 
 
and Process 2 AS batches. The Applicant explains that the redistribution is probably due to the use of a 
linearised DNA plasmid template in Process 2 instead of a PCR-derived DNA template in Process 1. For 
both processes, the poly(A)tail is anticipated to be sufficiently long to guarantee stability of the RNA 
and function in translation. This explanation is considered reasonable by the CHMP. 
The overall primary sequence of BNT162b2 active substance was demonstrated to be comparable by 
LC/MS/MS -oligonucleotide mapping. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed that the higher-
order structure of Process 1 and Process 2 AS batches were comparable.  
To demonstrate functionality, the protein size after in-vitro expression of BNT162b2 active substance 
was determined. The expressed protein sizes were demonstrated to be comparable between Process 1 
and Process 2 batches. However, further clarification is requested and include correlation with the 
calculated molecular weights of the intact S1S2 protein should be demonstrated. (SO1). 
A second comparability study was presented to assess comparability across the Process 2 
manufacturing facilities, batches each from the Andover and BioNTech sites were included in the study. 
In addition, Process 2 batches, planned for clinical supply and for emergency supply in the US market 
and representative batches from Process 1 were included in the comparison. 
In conclusion, the Process 2 batches manufactured at the Andover and BioNTech sites were 
demonstrated to be comparable with respect to identity as monitored by agarose gels and 5’Cap 
structure characterised by LC-UV and subsequent MS analysis. Furthermore, the primary sequence and 
the secondary structure was demonstrated to be comparable for all Process 1 and Process 2 batches 
included in the study. Poly(A) tail length and distribution was investigated by RP-HPLC and MS 
analysis. All process 2 batches were found comparable, while the Process 1 batches showed a 
somewhat different poly(A) tail pattern.  
The expressed protein size after in-vitro expression of BNT162b2 active substance was determined and 
the results demonstrate comparability between batches. However, the identity of the bands identified 
by WB are not sufficiently justified and further clarification is requested (SO1). 
Overall, the submitted data confirm consistent and comparable quality of Process 2 batches 
manufactured at the Andover and BioNTech sites.  
Process characterisation studies using scale-down models of individual unit operations, were 
performed.  
It should be noted that future changes to any of the process parameters, regardless of the 
classification of CPP or non-CPP, should be applied for as variation to the terms of the MA.  
Initially, addition volumes for ATP and CTP were identified as non-CPPs as both were supplied in 
theoretical excess. Following additional manufacturing campaigns and additional small-scale studies it 
was shown that these volumes could be limiting, and the ranges were widened at the higher end. It is 
noted that after the adjustment of these volumes, the percentage of RNA integrity has increased to 
levels more consistent with Process 1 batches. Nevertheless, since the target volumes for ATP and CTP 
have been increased to avoid that these nucleotides are rate-limiting in order to increase the 
percentage of RNA integrity, the PAR ranges need to be adjusted and the dossier updated accordingly 
(REC8). 
The acceptable ranges for CPPs will be updated in the dossier.  
A safety risk assessment for potential process-related impurities included in the active substance 
process relative to patient safety was performed. The sources of the impurities are sufficiently 
addressed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 19/140 
 
 
 
 
The safety risk assessment strategy involves comparison of the theoretical worst-case concentration of 
impurities, assuming no removal, to calculated safety concern thresholds.  
The worst-case levels of residual raw materials and reagents from the BNT162b2 active substance 
manufacturing process were calculated to be significantly below the pre-determined safety limits. This 
is found acceptable.  
Characterisation  
Analytical characterisation was performed on BNT162b2 active substance manufactured at commercial 
scale. This is found acceptable.  
The physico-chemical characterisation involved primary structure, 5’ cap structure, poly(A)tail and 
higher order structure evaluation. Primary structure was confirmed by oligonucleotide mapping and the 
orthogonal method, RNA sequencing using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. The results 
confirm the RNA sequence. The 5’-cap and 3’ poly A tail were confirmed by two separate LC-UV/MS-
methods. It was demonstrated that the predominant form of the 5’ terminus is the full-length 
nucleotide sequence with the 5’-Cap. The higher order structure of BNT162b2 mRNA active substance 
was characterised in solution using biophysical techniques.  
Overall, state-of-the-art methods were applied for physico-chemical characterisation and the results 
confirmed the expected sequence and quality attributes. It is recommended that the applicant should 
comprehensively describe the capability of a specific analytical method to detect lower amounts of 
product related impurity in the presence of the correct form in the active substance. (REC9).  
An uncertainty in the characterisation section is that no biological characterisation is presented. In 
response to questions during the procedure, the applicant has committed to update dossier with the 
strategy for potency determination and to address relevant functional assays including the in vitro 
expression (potency) results and results from the analysis of expressed protein size for active 
substance lot 20Y513C101. It is recommended that the applicant should discuss the results and the 
assay suitability for a certain method used for biological characterization of protein expression for the 
active substance (REC10). 
As described above, the expressed protein size results are currently not sufficiently confirmed and a 
specific obligation is laid down in the terms of the MA requiring their adequate characterisation (SO1). 
Process-related and product-related impurities as well as potential contaminants are described. A 
number of batches were evaluated for impurities, i.e. clinical, initial emergency supply and PPQ 
batches from both manufacturing sites. 
The sole product-related impurity addressed is double-stranded RNA, derived from the in-vitro 
transcription reaction. Results from the active substance batches demonstrate that the level of double 
stranded RNA is low, acceptable and consistent. 
In addition to double stranded RNA, there are truncated RNA, also referred to as fragmented species. 
Truncated RNA is reflected in the AS specification in terms of RNA integrity. However, the 
characterisation of BNT162b2 AS is currently not found to be complete in relation to a specific 
parameter. This is especially important considering that the current AS and finished product 
acceptance criteria allow for a proportion of fragmented species. The Applicant should provide 
additional data to further characterise the truncated and modified mRNA species present in the finished 
product. Relevant protein/peptide characterization data for predominant species should be provided 
(SO1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 20/140 
 
 
 
Residual DNA template is a process-related impurity derived from the linearised DNA template added 
to the in-vitro transcription reaction. Residual DNA template is measured as defined in the active 
substance specification. The levels are controlled by a specification limit which is considered suitably 
low.  
The potential contaminants described in this section are endotoxin and bioburden. Acceptable results 
are shown for the Proteinase K pool, UF retentate pre recovery, UF-product pool and the active 
substance, for all batches investigated. 
Specification 
The active substance specifications contain tests for appearance (clarity, coloration (Ph. Eur.)), pH (Ph. 
Eur.), content (RNA Concentration) (UV Spectroscopy), Identity of Encoded RNA Sequence (RT-PCR), 
RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), 5’- Cap (RP-HPLC), Poly(A) Tail (ddPCR), Residual DNA 
Template (qPCR), dsRNA (Immunoblot), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) and Bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification for active substance is considered acceptable for authorisation with respect 
to the attributes chosen for routine release testing. During the procedure the specification limits for a 
number of attributes were tightened in response to questions. 
The length of the poly(A) tails in BNT162b2 active substance is important for RNA stability and 
translational efficiency and even though comparable results have been reported to date, the poly(A) 
tail length should be included to the active substance release testing (SO2).  
The rationale used to establish the acceptance criteria is described in detail and based on a limited 
data set representative of BNT162b2 active substance manufactured at the intended commercial scale 
and process. From the available data, mRNA integrity, dsRNA and Poly(A) tail acceptance criteria are 
considered in relation with batches used in clinical studies and with the demonstrated manufacturing 
capability and need to be re-assessed and revised as appropriate as further data becomes available 
(SO2). 
Potency testing is not included in the control of active substance but instead is performed at the level 
of finished product release testing. Considering the nature of this product, the approach is endorsed by 
the CHMP.  
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods used for testing of the active substance are sufficiently described in the dossier. 
The following tests are performed in accordance with Ph Eur chapters; clarity (Ph Eur 2.2.1), colour (Ph 
Eur 2.2.2), pH (Ph Eur 2.2.3), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur 2.6.14) and bioburden (Ph Eur 2.6.12).  
All non-compendial analytical methods are sufficiently described. These analytical methods were 
suitably validated against the parameters presented in ICH Q2(R1).  
The technical procedure for the quantification of the poly(A) tail is considered, in general, sufficiently 
described but the suitability of this method for the intended purpose remains to be confirmed (SO2).  
Batch analysis  
Batch results are presented for active substance batches used for nonclinical toxicology, clinical trials, 
process performance qualification (PPQ), emergency supply and stability.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 21/140 
 
 
 
 
In general, the results obtained using the commercial process (Process 2) demonstrate batch to batch 
consistency with a few exceptions.  
Reference materials 
The current reference standard is referred to as the Clinical Reference Material (CRM). A stability 
protocol is provided. The Applicant has agreed to provide additional information such as protocol on 
preparation and qualification on the future reference material, as requested (REC12).
In future, a two-tiered system for future commercial reference material will be implemented. A primary 
reference material (PRM) and an initial working reference material (WRM) will be established for the 
active substance reference material.  
Container closure 
The information regarding container closure system is acceptable. Compliance with Ph. Eur. has been 
verified.  
Stability 
Based on the limited stability data presented a shelf-life at -20 ± 5°C can be approved for the active 
substance when stored in the commercial container closure system. The stability program is designed 
to follow ICH guidelines. The test methods used are stability indicating. Data from the sites Andover, 
Mainz, Rentschler are included. 
It is noted that the Applicant states that testing is currently in progress on the clinical batches and the 
dossier will be updated with data for these batches, as well as any new data available for the primary 
process validation batches. 
Thermal cycling studies have been initiated and a minimum of one process 
validation batch will be subjected to photostability studies at a future date. 
Based on the stability data presented a shelf-life at -20 ± 5°C can be approved for the active 
substance when stored in the commercial container closure system.
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The BNT162b2 finished product (FP) is supplied as a preservative-free, 5 dose multidose concentrate 
to be diluted prior to intramuscular injection. The finished product is a sterile dispersion of RNA-
containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous cryoprotectant buffer. 
Each vial, containing 0.45 mL of the finished product at pH 6.9 - 7.9 is designed to deliver a total of 5 
doses after dilution by addition of 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution to a total volume of 
2.25 mL. Each dose contains 30 µg of RNA in 0.3 mL.  
The overfill in the vial is required to ensure that the full five doses can be removed from the multi-dose 
vial after dilution and correctly administered, taking account of potential loss of product during these 
dilution and administration steps. The justification for the overfill is sufficiently discussed and 
considered to be acceptable. The applicant development data and finished product testing confirm that 
5 doses can be consistently extracted from the vial and delivered after dilution. 
The finished product is supplied in a 2 mL glass vial sealed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an 
aluminum seal with flip-off plastic cap. 
The full list of excipients is listed above in section 2.2.1; ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 (functional lipids), 
DSPC and cholesterol (structural lipids), potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 22/140 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
chloride and disodium phosphate dihydrate (buffer components), sucrose (cryoprotectant) and water 
for injections. 
All excipients except the functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 and the structural lipid DSPC comply 
with Ph. Eur. The functional lipid excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, are classified as novel excipients. 
Both structural lipids DSPC and cholesterol are used in several already approved finished products. A 
justification was provided for why DSPC is not considered to be a novel excipient. DSPC is used as part 
of the LNP for the EU approved finished product Onpattro which is administered intravenously in a 
much higher dose than the intramuscular dose for this product. Additionally; DOPC, a structurally 
related lipid, is present in finished products approved in the EU for intramuscular administration. It was 
therefore concluded that the level of information provided for DSPC, is in line with the requirements for 
a known excipient are sufficient and appropriately justified. 
The vial, stopper and seal components are compliant with the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs for 
primary containers and closures. 
Formulation development 
The section on formulation development describes and justifies the chosen formulation and is 
sufficiently comprehensive. 
The formulation development studies of the RNA containing lipid nanoparticles have been thoroughly 
described. The LNPs consists of four lipids, each has a functional or structural purpose. The formed 
RNA-containing LNPs are solid particles. Furthermore, the accumulated batch-data to date show 
consistent manufacture of lipid nanoparticles both with respect to size and polydispersity. 
Lipid-related impurities have been identified in the finished product and have been characterized. An 
investigation has been initiated and is ongoing to assess and review potential root causes.  The 
outcome of the investigation shall be provided (SO2). 
Visual particulate matter has occasionally been observed in finished product batches. Characterization 
data have been presented and the control strategy has been discussed. The data demonstrates that 
the particles are comprised of components of the finished product formulation. A 100% visual 
inspection is performed during manufacturing and the automatic inspection system is updated to 
improve the inspection. Routine release or routine stability data indicate that the propensity of 
particles to form following storage is low. If particles are observed in the diluted vaccine the vial should 
be discarded. 
Novel excipients 
Two novel excipients are included in the finished product, the cationic lipid ALC-0315 and the 
PEGylated lipid ALC-0159. Limited information regarding the novel excipients are provided.  
ALC-0315 (cationic lipid) 
The ALC-0315 novel excipient is a cationic lipid containing a tertiary amine and two ester moieties, ((4-
hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate).

A brief description of the chemical synthesis is provided. The suppliers are defined in the dossier. A 
similar manufacturing process is used for ALC-0315 in clinical and commercial finished product 
batches. 
In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch 
consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the applicant should provide additional 
information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0315. (SO4) 
The proposed specification is considered acceptable based on the available data. However, additional 
information regarding specifications that should be provided (SO4). 
Stability data from one supplier indicate that ALC-0315 is stable when stored at the recommended 
storage conditions. Additionally, the excipient is stable at room temperature suitable for use in further 
manufacturing steps. Stability data from one supplier is considered representative for lipid from 
another supplier. 
Lipid related impurities have been observed in some recently manufactured finished product batches, 
correlated with ALC-0315 lipid batches. The quality of ALC-0315 excipient is considered acceptable 
based on the available data on condition that specific impurities in the finished product will be further 
evaluated (SO2). 
ALC-0159 (PEGylated lipid) 
The ALC-0159 novel excipient is a PEGylated lipid, 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-
ditetradecylacetamide. 
Figure 2 ALC-0159 structure 
A brief description of the chemical synthesis is provided.  
The suppliers are defined in the dossier. The same supplier was used during development for clinical 
phase 1, 2 and 3 studies. The same synthetic route was used for ALC-0159 throughout development of 
the finished product. 
In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch 
consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the applicant is requested to provide 
additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0159. 
(SO5) 
Assessment report

The proposed specification is considered acceptable based on available data. However, in order to 
improve impurity control strategy and to ensure batch to batch consistency of the finished product, 
there are additional information regarding specifications that should be provided (SO5). 
Stability data indicate that ALC-0159 is stable when stored at the recommended storage conditions.  
Manufacturing process development 
The development history of the finished product is sufficiently described. The process has been 
transferred to commercial facilities for manufacture of later clinical materials, emergency supply and 
commercial supply. A table on finished product lot genealogy and usage has been provided. 
The applicant states that comparability is demonstrated in a stepwise approach through a combination 
of release testing and extended characterization methods. It is agreed that comparability was 
sufficiently demonstrated with only small differences noted. 
During the present regulatory procedure, release testing results of a number of recently manufactured 
GMP-batches was presented.  The release data for the GMP-batches are compared to the clinical 
batches as well as to the results of the emergency supply lots. It is agreed that the differences noted 
are few and minor for all tests included in the FP specification and that comparability has been 
sufficiently demonstrated subject to the specific obligations further described, for the attributes tested 
and given the pandemic situation. In addition, the comparison will be further extended with additional 
characterization testing on future batches of finished product. The applicant has confirmed that testing 
will be performed according to the agreed finished product comparability testing protocol and the 
results will be submitted in the frame of a specific obligation (SO3).     
A concurrent validation approach will be used due to the urgent need for this product and the 
pandemic situation. The rationale for this approach has been documented and is agreed. This 
concurrent approach requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run. An 
overall report per site will be compiled that summarises all evaluations and contains a comparability 
assessment of the data of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked to this plan will 
be written that summarises all findings from the different validation reports. Process validation (PPQ) 
for commercial scale batches were initiated, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was 
provided.  
In summary, given that an acceptable validation program at the commercial facility has been 
established, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was provided, the information on 
process validation is considered acceptable subject to the agreed specific obligation that the MAH 
should provide additional validation data (SO3). 
The development of the manufacturing process is extensively described, and critical process 
parameters are defined. Process characterisation studies using scale-down models of individual unit 
operations, were performed.  
Overall control strategy was presented but some parameters and ranges may be updated after PPQ 
and additional characterization studies completed. As for assessment of overall control strategy, a 
complete set of data and information is needed, this document will be assessed when finalised. A time-
plan for the provision of the final data set has been agreed with the applicant (SO3). 
The analytical testing strategy of finished product has changed throughout the development and these 
changes have been described. Bridging studies have been performed for analytical tests that have 
been changed or replaced (subvisible particles, identity of encoded RNA sequence and RNA integrity). 
This is found acceptable.

Container closure system 
The development of the container closure system is sufficiently presented. The primary packaging is 
composed of glass vial and rubber stopper and are compliant with the compendial requirements of Ph. 
Eur.  
Controlled extraction studies have been performed on the bromobutyl rubber stopper. The applicant 
will provide the updated results from the leachables study for assessment. (REC13) 
Microbiological attributes 
Container closure integrity testing has been performed to demonstrate that the 2 mL container closure 
presentation is integral.   
In order to improve the control strategy, the MAH should provide validation results of alternative 
sterility test i.e. rapid sterility test for assessment before implementation (REC14). 
Compatibility 
The studies described have been performed to assess physicochemical stability of the FP after dilution 
with 0.9% sodium chloride solution in the original glass vial as well with commonly used commercially 
available administration components and using worst-case conditions for dosage and administration in 
the clinical setting. The thawed hold time (in-use period) of undiluted finished product has been 
defined as 5 days at 2-8 °C and 2 hours at up to 30 °C. 
Results presented support physicochemical stability of FP diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 
up to 24 hours at ambient or refrigerated temperatures (2-30°C) following an in-use thawed hold time 
of up to 5 days at 2-8 °C and 2 hours at 30 °C.  
Compatibility with dosing components (syringes and needles) has been established for up to 6 hours. 
Furthermore, a microbiological in-use hold time study has been performed by a challenge test including 
five compendial micro-organisms. No significant growth (>0.5log10 from the start-point) was observed 
for any of the microorganisms within 12 hours of inoculation with storage at 20-25°C of diluted FP in 
0.9% sodium chloride solution. Therefore, based on the results from the microbiological in-use hold 
time study, the proposed in-use period for up to 6 hours at ambient temperatures is agreed, as 
reflected in the product information. Furthermore, it is also stated by the applicant that the in-use 
period is in alignment with the WHO policy on the use of opened multi-dose vaccine vials (WHO Policy 
Statement: Multi-dose vial policy (MDVP) – handling of multi-dose vaccine vials after opening, rev 
2014).  
The compatibility of finished product is acceptably demonstrated by the dilution and administration 
simulation studies performed.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is batch released by Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV, Puurs, Belgium or BioNTech 
Manufacturing GmbH, Mainz, Germany. The GMP status of the manufacturing and testing sites of the 
finished product have been confirmed. 
The finished product manufacturing process includes the following main steps: active substance 
thawing and dilution, LNP formation and stabilisation, buffer exchange, concentration and filtration, 
concentration adjustment and addition of cryoprotectant, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, visual 
inspection, labelling, freezing and storage. Critical manufacturing steps are discussed, and relevant in-
process controls are applied. 
Dossier should be updated to provide more details on increase batch size including range number of AS 
bag and batches used, configuration of filters filter surfaces used and process controls (REC14). The 
absence of a test for residuals is considered acceptable. 
Shipping validation 
This section gives a summary of the qualification of the shipping process for transport of BNT162b2 
finished product by passive thermal shipping containers for air and road shipments at temperature 
conditions of -90 to -60 °C from the finished product manufacturing and packaging site to dosing sites 
in the EU. 
Short periods of time outside of the intended routine shipping condition of -90 to -60 °C during 
transport and at distribution sites have been defined. 
The shipping temperature range of -90 to -60 °C is based on available stability data.  
One thaw and refreeze cycle is allowed during transportation. Time during transportation out of the 
intended storage and shipping temperature range (-90 to -60 °C) without thaw is allowed for specified 
times and conditions for multiple transfers and redistribution during shipping with subsequent 
refreezing to -90 to -60 °C between transfers. The temperature excursion allowances are supported by 
data. 
The selected shipping methods include shipping containers designed to maintain product temperature 
through a combination of insulation and dry ice. The applicant has prior experience with these passive 
thermal conveyances and has demonstrated that they maintain the -90 to -60 °C temperature range 
during product shipments, including minor shipping delays and short exposures to extreme 
temperatures occasionally observed during shipping and handling. 
All shipments are continuously monitored using temperature data loggers. 
The overall qualification strategy considered both thermal and mechanical aspects of shipping in 
passive thermal conveyance, supported by operational qualification and performance qualification 
testing. A summary of the shipping qualification strategy has been provided. 
For the passive thermal conveyance, the qualification is focused on the ability of the passive system to 
maintain the required temperatures with specified phase change materials or dry ice when exposed to 
ambient temperature profiles for worst-case season. These studies are carried out in laboratory 
chambers to simulate the summer as worst-case ambient profiles. 
A simulated distribution study  demonstrated finished product and package integrity after exposure to 
simulated distribution hazard conditions, following the durations outlined in the worst-case extended 
transport lanes. 
Results of thermal qualification have met specified acceptance criteria and support shipments of 
BNT162b2 finished product using the passive thermal conveyance shipping containers either directly or 
Assessment report

via qualified distribution centres. Passive thermal conveyance performance qualification and the 
simulated shipping study finished product impact testing have been performed to complete shipping 
qualification assessing both thermal and mechanical aspects of shipping. 
Process parameters for storage and shipping are found acceptable. 
Media fills 
Media fills have been performed for the filling line to validate the aseptic filling process and were run in 
accordance to guidelines. Results have been provided from three consecutive simulation studies and 
gave satisfactory results without any contaminated units. Results for the media fill cover the maximum 
process time for the manufacturing of finished product and simulate worst-case manufacturing 
conditions. The media fill validation demonstrated that aseptic conditions are maintained during the 
filling process. For the filling line, the maximum time will be established upon completion of media fill 
qualification studies. This is found acceptable.  
Verification of in-process test methods 
Data on verification of in-process test methods was pending at the time of the present regulatory 
procedure and should be provided during Q2 2021 (REC15).  
Hold times 
Hold times have been established. It is noted that any change of this section needs to be submitted to 
the Agency via a variation application.  
Process validation plan 
A FP process validation plan has been provided.  
A concurrent validation approach will be used due to the urgent need for this product and the 
pandemic situation. The rationale for this approach has been documented. This concurrent approach 
requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run.  An overall report per site 
will be compiled that summarises all evaluations and contains a comparability assessment of the data 
of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked to this plan will be written that 
summarises all findings from the different validation reports. 
It is described in the dossier that commercial scale PPQ-batches will be manufactured during Dec 2020 
to Jan 2021 and the applicant has provided a process validation plan. In order to confirm the 
consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the applicant should provide additional 
validation data, by March 2021. (SO3) 
Filter validation 
Acceptable information has been provided during the procedure for filter validation on the filters used 
for sterile filtration, describing the material, pore size and surface area. All study results met the 
predetermined acceptance criteria and the studies for microbial retention, membrane compatibility, 
extractable substances and integrity test determination have shown that the filters are appropriate for 
sterile filtration of the finished product. In addition, the applicant has clarified that the filter used for 
bioburden reduction is identical to the filters used for sterile filtration. 
The MAH should provide the results for assessment from the filter validation as soon as they are 
available (REC23). 
Control of excipients 
ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 are novel excipients, not previously used in an approved finished product 
within EU. Additional information is provided separately in Section A.3 of the dossier. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020

DSPC is a non-compendial excipient sufficiently controlled by an in-house specification. 
Cholesterol is sufficiently controlled according to the Ph. Eur. monograph with additional tests for 
residual solvents and microbial contamination. 
The other excipients (sucrose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, disodium phosphate dihydrate, 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate and water for injection) are controlled according to respective Ph. 
Eur. monograph. 
The processing aids ethanol and citrate buffer are controlled according to Ph. Eur. standards and for 
HEPES and EDTA, reference is made to the active substance. 
Product specification  
The release and stability testing specifications for BNT162b2 finished product include tests for 
Appearance (Visual), Appearance (Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
Osmolality (Osmometry), LNP Size (Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP Polydispersity (Dynamic Light 
Scattering), RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence assay), RNA content (Fluorescence assay), ALC-0315 
content (HPLC-CAD), ALC-0159 content (HPLC-CAD), DSPC content (HPLC-CAD), Cholesterol content 
(HPLC-CAD), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), Lipid identities (HPLC-CAD), Identity of encoded RNA 
sequence (RT-PCR), Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary 
Gel Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and Container Closure Integrity 
(Dye incursion). For all quality attributes tested on stability except for RNA integrity, the acceptance 
criteria for release and stability testing throughout shelf life are the same. 
The specifications document for finished product in section 3.2.P.5.1 of the dossier includes a 
comprehensive panel of relevant tests along with corresponding acceptance criteria. 
With the exception of osmolality, volume of injections in containers, HPLC-CAD (lipid identities) and 
RT-PCR (identity of encoded RNA sequence), which are performed only at FP release, all other 
analytical procedures are conducted at release and stability studies for finished product. It is stated by 
the applicant that the acceptance criteria used for stability during shelf-life will be the same as the 
acceptance criteria used for lot release. 
Several questions in relation to the acceptance criteria in the FP specifications were raised during the 
procedure (i.e. the LNP size, polydispersity, RNA encapsulation, in-vitro expression and RNA integrity). 
The acceptance criteria were tightened.   
For potency, RNA integrity, RNA encapsulation, lipid content and polydispersity index, the acceptance 
criteria will be re-assessed during Q2 2021 in order to ensure a consistent product quality by providing 
additional information to enhance the control strategy. This is found acceptable subject to a specific 
obligation. (SO2) 
The vial contains an overfill in order to ensure that the full required volume (5 doses) can be delivered 
following dilution and administration in line with the product information. The finished product 
specification includes a test to confirm the extractable volume from the vial provides 5 doses. During 
the procedure the applicant proposed to update the product information and instructions for use to 
indicate that up to 6 doses can be delivered from the vial. This proposed change to the product 
information was not considered acceptable as no supporting data were provided to demonstrate that 6 
doses can be consistently extracted. In order to support such a change in the product information, a 
variation should be submitted to update the specification limits for extractable volume, supported by 
appropriate pharmaceutical development data to support the claim of 6 doses (REC21). 
A risk evaluation regarding the risk of N-nitrosamines impurities was provided concluding that there is 
no risk of the presence of nitrosamines in the finished product taking into account the active 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020

substance, the finished product formulation and primary packaging. The risk assessment is considered 
acceptable. 
It is recommended that a risk assessment should be provided with respect to the potential presence of 
elemental impurities in the active product based on the general principles outlined in Section 5.1 of 
ICH Q3D (REC17). 
A question was raised during the procedure since no information and discussion was provided in the 
dossier on lipid-related impurities originating from the degradation of the LNP. It is argued by the 
applicant that with respect to potential lipid-related impurities originating from the degradation of 
LNPs, no degradation of the LNP FP has been observed in the stability studies at the recommended 
storage temperature (-70 to -90 °C) for the LNP as shown by specifications for size and polydispersity, 
RNA encapsulation, RNA and lipid content and RNA integrity quality attributes. This is acknowledged. 
In addition, further evaluation of lipid-related impurities in the finished product should be performed 
and the results submitted and discussed in the frame of a specific obligation (SO2). 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis 
The dossier includes release testing results of four recently manufactured GMP-batches. These finished 
product GMP batches were manufactured at the commercial FP manufacturing site. The release data 
for these GMP-batches are compared to min-max ranges of the small-scale clinical batches as well as 
to the results of the emergency supply lots. It is agreed that the differences noted are few and minor 
for all tests included in the FP specification. Therefore, it can be concluded that comparability has been 
sufficiently demonstrated for the attributes tested given the pandemic situation and considering that 
further data is to be provided in the frame of a specific obligation. In addition, the comparison will be 
further extended with additional characterization testing on future PPQ-batches of finished product. 
The applicant has confirmed that testing will be performed according to the finished product 
comparability testing protocol. and the results will be provided in the frame of specific obligation 
(SO3). 
Reference materials 
The finished product reference materials is the same as for active substance. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 6 months for the finished product is proposed when stored at the recommended storage 
condition of -90°C to -60°C. 
The applicant has provided stability results up to 6 months at -80 to -60°C of one clinical batch and up 
to 6 months of a non-clinical batch of finished product. Two weeks data are also provided for two 
emergency supply under recommended storage conditions. In addition, there are newly initiated 
stability studies on the recently manufactured GMP-batches as well as plans to initiate stability studies 
on the future PPQ-batches.  
Stability data have also been provided at accelerated (-40°C to +5°C) and stressed (+25°C to +30°C) 
storage conditions. 
The stability studies are performed in accordance with ICH Q5C (Quality of biotechnological products: 
Stability testing of biotechnological/biological products) and the same or representative container-
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 30/140 
 
 
 
closure system are used in these stability studies as will be used for commercial batches. The test 
methods used are stability indicating. 
Overall, the presented stability data indicate no signs of degradation, significant trends or changes in 
terms of quality at the recommended storage condition (-90 to -60°C). 
The applicant has provided updated reports from the ongoing stability studies and the presented data 
are considered sufficient and in support of the shelf-life claim since comparability has been sufficiently 
demonstrated between commercial scale GMP batches and the small-scale clinical batches. 
In addition, the initial in-use period for the thawed, undiluted vial is 5 days at 2-8°C followed by 
storage at up to 30°C for not more than 2 hours. This is found acceptable. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has also been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2ºC to 30ºC after 
dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  
It is described that the future PPQ-lots will be enrolled in the stability program and the stability 
protocol has been defined in the dossier. This is acceptable; however, the applicant should commit to 
provide the 6 months stability data for the PPQ-batches for assessment as soon as they are available. 
(REC20). Notwithstanding requests for further stability updates, in accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported 
to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
It has been clarified by the applicant that results on photostability testing studies will be provided for 
assessment (REC19). 
It is recommended that the applicant should investigate the opportunities for an increased temperature 
at long term storage conditions for the finished product from -70°C to -20°C. In addition, the applicant 
should investigate the possibility to prolong the in-use storage time (before dilution) of 5 days at 2-8°C 
as well as the possibilities to extend the claims for transport conditions at 2-8°C (REC22). 
A shelf-life of 6 months for the finished product at -90 to -60°C is accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
Adventitious agents’ safety evaluation has been provided for the AS manufacturing sites and for the 
finished product manufacturing site. 
Reagents used in active substance manufacturing and in the establishment of the MCB and WCB are 
the only materials of animal origin used in the manufacture of BNT162b2. The applicant has identified 
contamination of the product by Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) agents as the main 
theoretical risk associated with these ingredients and it is deemed of minimal risk.
Additional clarifications were requested and provided for a number of other materials.
Sufficient details on the aseptic validation filling and media fills have been provided. Furthermore, 
adequate testing for bioburden and endotoxin is performed at different stages of the manufacturing 
process. Therefore, no additional concerns are raised.
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During the procedure, a number of issues were highlighted relating to the GMP status of the manufacture 
of the active substance and of the testing sites of the finished product for the purpose of batch release, 
the comparability between clinical and commercial material and the absence of validation data on finished 
product manufactured at the commercial site. These issues were classified as Major Objections (MOs).  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 31/140 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
After  further  information  was  obtained  from  the  sites  and  inspectors,  questions  regarding  the 
manufacturing were addressed and manufacturing authorisations and GMP certificates are in place for 
all active substance and finished product manufacturing and testing sites. 
Some of the proposed sites for batch control testing are currently located in the USA. The following time-
limited derogation has been introduced as a condition to the MA: 
‘In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early 
supply this medicinal product is subject to a time-limited exemption allowing reliance on batch control 
testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are located in a third country. This exemption ceases to 
be  valid  on  31  August  2021.  Implementation  of  EU  based  batch  control  arrangements,  including  the 
necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, has to be completed by the 31 August 
2021 at the latest, in line with the agreed plan for this transfer of testing. Progress reports have to be 
submitted on 31 March 2021 and included in the annual renewal application’. 
Additional data have been submitted by the applicant during the procedure in response to the other 
MOs and other questions raised.  
Having considered the emergency situation and the quality documentation provided, the CHMP 
imposed some specific obligations (SOs) with clearly defined due dates (refer to Conclusions for 
details). In addition, the CHMP adopted some Recommendations (RECs) to be addressed by the 
Applicant. 
In addition, it should be ensured that, in accordance with Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 
16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the active substance and finished product are manufactured and 
controlled by means of processes and methods in compliance with the latest state of scientific and 
technical progress. As a consequence, the manufacturing processes and controls (including the 
specifications) shall be designed to ensure product consistency and a product quality of at least shown 
to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and shall introduce any subsequent changes to their 
manufacturing process and controls as needed. 
Active substance 
Overall, the information provided is satisfactory. However, certain information is still pending due to 
the very short time frame of product development and will either be updated in the dossier imminently 
or further addressed in specific obligations and other post-approval measures.  
Information on the manufacturing process and process controls for the manufacturing sites Andover 
and BNT Mainz & Rentschler have been provided and are considered satisfactory.  
Two active substance processes have been used during the development; Process 1 and 2. The major 
changes between AS Process 1 and 2 are: increased process scale, DNA template changed from a PCR 
template to linearised plasmid DNA, magnetic bead purification replaced with proteinase K digestion 
and UFDF steps. Based on the differences observed between batches manufactured by active 
substance Process 1 and 2 for the CQA mRNA integrity and lack of characterisation data, a MO was 
raised regarding comparability, characterisation and clinical qualification of the one proposed 
acceptance criteria. Biological characterisation of the active substance was limited, and additional data 
and discussion were requested to address functionality. Additional characterisation data for the active 
substance are to be provided to confirm the identities of the observed Western Blot (WB) bands 
obtained by the in vitro expression assay (SO1). 
Truncated RNA species are regarded as product-related impurities and can be expected due to the 
principle of the in-vitro transcription reaction (i.e. directional polymerase activity) and (theoretical) 
hydrolysis during manufacturing. Analysis of RNase treated samples showed that all species detected 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 32/140 
 
 
 
by the capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-based method are composed of RNA. Manufacturing 
consistency with respect to fragmented species has been sufficiently demonstrated.  
 There were some differences in truncated RNA species level, however further analyses revealed a 
comparable overall fragmentation profile among Process 1 and Process 2 active substance batches. 
Additionally, oligonucleotide mapping data demonstrated no significant differences observed between 
Process 1 and Process 2 active substance batches. 
The company does not expect truncated transcripts formulated in the finished product to pose a safety 
or efficacy concern, as in their view no protein expression is expected from truncated transcripts. 
Further, clinical trials with process 1 material have not revealed major safety concerns to date. 
Truncated BNT162b2 RNA species lacking either the 5’ cap or the poly(A) tail are expected to be 
rapidly targeted for degradation in the cytoplasm or would show a decrease or loss of translation 
efficiency. Preliminary characterization data on isolated fragment species suggest that fragment 
species predominantly include the 5’-cap but lack the poly(A) tail, supporting the hypothesis that most 
fragments would arise from premature termination in the IVT reaction.  
However, as the overall characterisation of the truncated species is still limited, additional analysis of 
truncated species, additional translated protein characterisation, additional characterisation of lipid-
related impurities and potential lipid-RNA species should be provided to support that they are not 
impacting clinical performance in terms of safety and/or efficacy. The current specification allows for a 
certain level of truncated mRNA species to be present however data from recent batches have shown 
levels of truncated species below that level. No related safety issues have been identified in the clinical 
studies thus far in subjects who received vaccine containing up to a certain level of truncated species. 
Therefore, the current specification is considered acceptable subject to the submission of additional 
data in the frame of a specific obligation (SO1).  
Based on available data, the proposed specification for active substance is acceptable with respect to 
the attributes chosen for routine release testing. However, the length of the poly(A) tails in BNT162b2 
active substance is critical for RNA stability and translational efficiency and therefore should be 
introduced in active substance release testing in the frame of a specific obligation (SO2). Moreover, 
the active substance specification acceptance limits should be re-assessed and revised as appropriate, 
as further data become available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with manufacturing process 
capability (SO2). 
It is noted that the Applicant states that testing is currently in progress on the clinical batches and data 
for these batches, as well as any new data available for the primary process validation batches, will be 
provided. Based on the limited stability data presented, a shelf-life is approved for the active 
substance. 
Finished product 
The finished product is a preservative-free, multi-dose concentrate to be diluted for intramuscular 
injection, intended for 5 doses. The finished product is a sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid 
nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous cryoprotectant buffer. 
The formulation development studies of the RNA containing lipid nanoparticles have been thoroughly 
described including studies that were performed with available active substance, representative of the 
mRNA platform and included in the finished product. 
The development of the manufacturing process is extensively described, and critical process 
parameters are defined. 
The manufacturing process includes lipid nanoparticle fabrication and bulk finished product formulation 
followed by fill and finish, and the process has been acceptably described.

Comparability between the commercial finished product and the clinical finished product has been 
sufficiently demonstrated for the attributes tested and will be subject to a specific obligation. 
Limited data on the finished product batches manufactured at the commercial facility (entire 
manufacturing process at the commercial site Pfizer, Puurs, at commercial scale, active substance from 
process 2) were presented. A process validation plan for PPQ lots has been provided. 
A concurrent validation approach will be used due to the urgent need for this product and the 
pandemic situation. The rationale for this approach has been documented. This concurrent approach 
requires interim reports to be documented for each individual validation run. An overall report per site 
will be compiled that summarises all evaluations and contains a comparability assessment of the data 
of all batches manufactured. Finally, a concluding report linked to this plan will be written that 
summarises all findings from the different validation reports.  
Further data was requested in order to conclude on the consistency of finished product manufacturing, 
to assure comparability between the commercial product with the product used in clinical trials, and to 
support the claimed finished product shelf-life and storage conditions. A process validation plan for PPQ 
lots has been provided. Process validation (PPQ) for commercial scale batches were initiated, and a 
summary report from one PPQ validation batch was provided.  
In summary, given that an acceptable validation program, also comprising the commercial facility at 
Puurs, Belgium, has been established, and a summary report from one PPQ validation batch was 
provided, the information on process validation is considered acceptable subject to the agreed specific 
obligation that the MAH should provide additional validation data (SO3). 
The specifications for finished product include a comprehensive panel of relevant tests along with 
corresponding acceptance criteria. Several issues in relation to the acceptance criteria in the finished 
product specifications were raised, i.e. the LNP size, polydispersity, RNA encapsulation, in-vitro 
expression and RNA integrity. Whilst FP specifications were subsequently amended and overall found to 
be acceptable, the acceptance limits should be re-assessed, and revised as appropriate, as further data 
becomes available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with manufacturing process capability (SO2). 
Two novel excipients are included in the LNP. Complete information is not provided for both the 
cationic lipid ALC-0315 and the PEGylated lipid ALC-0159. In order to assure comprehensive control 
throughout the lifecycle of the finished product and to ensure batch to batch consistency, further 
information needs to be submitted regarding the synthetic process and control strategy in line with 
specific obligations (SO4, SO5). 
Lipid-related impurities have been observed in some recently manufactured finished product batches. 
For the batches with lipid-related impurities the existing quality control parameters including RNA 
integrity remain unchanged. 
Considering the above and the emergency situation, the characterisation of the active substance and 
finished product is considered acceptable, and the proposed specifications for RNA Integrity and 5’-Cap 
are considered to be scientifically justified and acceptable. Nevertheless, additional data to complete 
the characterisation of the active substance and finished product and additional clinical data from 
batches currently in use in ongoing clinical studies, are considered important to confirm the clinical 
qualification of these specifications. These data are requested to be provided as specific obligations to 
the applied conditional marketing authorisation (SO1, SO2). 
Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of vaccine from Process 
1. The commercial batches are produced using a different process (Process 2), and the comparability 
of these processes relies on demonstration of comparable biological, chemical and physical 
characteristics of the active substance and finished product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 34/140 
 
 
 
The characterisation and control of active substance and finished product are limited in relation to 
critical quality attributes and impurities. The suitability of the analytical methods used for control of 
potency and poly(A) tail have not been fully demonstrated.  
Data demonstrate the presence of significant amounts of truncated/modified forms of mRNA at 
somewhat higher levels in the batches manufactured with the commercial process as compared to 
material used in clinical trials. These forms are poorly characterised, and the limited data provided for 
protein expression do not fully address the uncertainties relating to the risk of translating 
proteins/peptides other than the intended spike protein.  
The control strategy for active substance and finished product is important to guarantee acceptable 
quality and ensure batch to batch consistency of the finished product. Regarding the proposed control 
strategy, questions were raised both with regard to the suitability of the test methods used and the 
acceptance criteria for some tests. 
Based on the above, the following uncertainties are considered to be of importance for the benefit-risk 
assessment: 
• 
Truncated and modified RNA are present as impurities. Considering the low dose of mRNA (30 
µg), the impurities are not considered a safety issue based on general toxicological principles. 
However, when present in the cell there is a possibility that aberrant proteins will be expressed 
with possibilities for unwanted immunological events. The risk of this occurring is considered 
low based on the following observations and considerations: 
o  Such impurities were present in the vaccine used in the Phase 3 clinical trials with an 
acceptable safety profile. Although the lack of characterisation hinders a full 
comparability evaluation there is no indication that there would be important 
qualitative differences in the nature of these impurities. 
o  The high levels of these impurities reflect the instability of RNA resulting in generation 
of RNA fragments both in the transcription step and thereafter. Based on 
electrophoretic data it appears that there is a diverse set of fragments. Although not 
confirmed, it is unlikely that these RNA molecules to a large extent would be mRNA 
molecules with intact 5’-cap and 3’-polyA.  
o  The level of any individual aberrant mRNA species would in any way be magnitudes 
lower than the level of the intact mRNA and this would be mirrored by the level of 
protein expression. The amount of the protein would be expected to be too low to elicit 
an immune response. The spike protein is a highly immunogenic protein and 
immunodominance would also ascertain that the immune response to the aberrant 
protein would be non-significant. 
• 
Lipid related impurities were observed in recently produced finished product batches. Based on 
the low dose (30 µg mRNA) it is considered that the amounts of these impurities are too low to 
be of toxicological significance.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the emergency context of the current (COVID-19) 
pandemic, is considered to be sufficiently consistent and acceptable subject to the specific obligations 
abovementioned.  
In general, physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in an acceptable way. While the characterisation data still 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 35/140 
 
 
 
need to be completed, the results of tests carried out indicate consistency of product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective the product is 
expected to have a satisfactory clinical performance. 
The submitted information indicate that currently manufactured product batches are of a quality that is 
appropriate and sufficiently comparable to that of clinical development batches. However, to ensure 
that the quality of future batches will also remain appropriate and comparable to that of clinical 
development batches over the life cycle of the medicinal product a number of issues are expected to 
be addressed though fulfilment of specific obligations, within defined time frames.  
The CHMP has identified the following specific obligations to address the identified quality development 
issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product, and 
which therefore are needed to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical (quality) data and controls for 
the product. The specific points that need to be addressed in order to fulfil the imposed specific 
obligations are detailed below. 
In addition, and in accordance with Article 16 of regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall inform 
the Agency of any information which might influence the quality of the medicinal product concerned, 
such as any necessary tightening of the finished product specifications earlier than July 2021. This is 
also related to the general obligation to vary the terms of the marketing authorisation to take into 
account the technical and scientific progress and enable the medicinal product to be manufactured and 
checked by means of generally accepted scientific methods. 
In the context of the conditional marketing authorisation, the applicant should fulfil the following 
specific obligations (SOs): 
•  SO1: In order to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, 
the MAH should provide additional data. Due date: July 2021. Interim reports: March 
2021. 
•  SO2: In order to ensure consistent product quality, the MAH should provide additional 
information to enhance the control strategy, including the active substance and finished 
product specifications. Due date: July 2021. Interim reports: March 2021. 
•  SO3: In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the 
MAH should provide additional validation data. Due date: March 2021. 
•  SO4: In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and 
batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the MAH should 
provide additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the 
excipient ALC-0315. Due date: July 2021, Interim reports: January 2021, April 2021. 
•  SO5: In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and 
batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the MAH should 
provide additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the 
excipient ALC-0159. Due date: July 2021, Interim reports: January 2021, April 2021. 
As regards SO1, the following data are requested in order to complete the information on the active 
substance and finished product characterisation. 
a)  Additional data is to be provided to further characterise the truncated and modified mRNA 
species present in the finished product. Data are expected to cover batches used in clinical 
trials (for which the characterisation data could be available earlier) and the PPQ batches. 
These data should address results from ion pairing RP-HPLC addressing 5’cap levels and 
presence of the poly(A) tail. These data should further address the potential for translation into 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 36/140 
 
 
 
truncated S1S2 proteins/peptides or other proteins/peptides. Relevant protein/peptide 
characterization data for predominant species should be provided. Any homology between 
translated proteins (other than the intended spike protein) and human proteins that may, due 
to molecular mimicry, potentially cause an autoimmune process should be evaluated.  Due 
date: July 2021. Interim reports: March 2021, and on a monthly basis. 
b)  The analysis of the main peak of the RNA integrity test representing the full-length RNA, 
should be also undertaken addressing 5’cap levels and presence of the poly (A) tail. Due date: 
July 2021. Interim report: March 2021 
c)  Additional data for the active substance are to be provided to confirm the identities of the 
observed Western Blot (WB) bands obtained by the in vitro expression assay. Protein 
heterogeneity, resulting in broad bands on the WB and uncertainties in the theoretical intact 
molecular weight of the spike protein, is assumed to be due to glycosylation. Therefore, to 
further confirm protein identities, enzymatic deglycosylation of the expressed proteins followed 
by WB analysis should be performed. Correlation with the calculated molecular weights of the 
intact S1S2 protein should be demonstrated. Due date: July 2021. Interim report: March 
2021 
As regards SO2, the following data are requested to be provided in order to ensure a comprehensive 
control strategy, including active substance and finished product specifications: 
a)  The active substance and finished product specifications acceptance limits, should be re-
assessed and revised as appropriate, as further data becomes available from ongoing clinical 
trials and in line with manufacturing process capability and stability data of the product. 
Comprehensive data should be provided comprising batch analyses of a suitable number of 
commercial batches as well as analyses of batches that have been used in the (ongoing) 
clinical trials. Due date: July 2021, Interim reports March 2021, and on a monthly 
basis.  
b)  Poly(A) tail length is considered a critical attribute, which should be controlled on each batch, 
even though comparable results were obtained until now. An active substance specification to 
control poly(A) length should be introduced. A suitable method should be developed and 
appropriate acceptance criteria should be set. Due date: July 2021, Interim reports: March 
2021 
c)  The poly(A) tail percentage is considered a critical attribute, but uncertainties remain on the 
suitability of the method. Additional data should be provided to support the suitability of the 
method used for %poly(A) tail or an alternative suitable assay should be developed and 
introduced. The %poly(A) tail should be characterised following any future active substance 
process changes. Due date: July 2021, Interim reports: March 2021 
d)  Since mRNA integrity and polydispersity are CQAs for the efficacy of the medicinal product, the 
finished product acceptance criteria for these parameters should be revised as further data 
becomes available from ongoing clinical trials and in line with manufacturing process capability. 
Due date: July 2021, Interim reports: March 2021.   
e)  Additional data should be provided to support the suitability of the method used for potency 
determination or an alternative suitable assay for this purpose should be developed and 
introduced. Then the finished product acceptance criteria for potency should be revised 
accordingly. Due date: July 2021, Interim reports: March 2021 
f)  Lipid-related impurities should be further evaluated. An appropriate control strategy should be 
introduced, suitably justified and provided for assessment during Q2 2021. Due date: July

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to take due account of 
technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Active substance 
1.  The MAH should implement relevant testing strategies to ensure an adequate microbiological 
control for the starting materials. 
2.  The MAH should implement a relevant testing strategy to ensure that HEPES (Pfizer) raw 
material, included in the formulation buffer of FP, is free from contaminating RNases.  
3.  The MAH should implement in-house functional activity analytical methods for release testing 
of enzymes used in the manufacturing process at all relevant manufacturing sites, by Q1 2021.  
4.  The MAH should reassess the specification for the linear DNA template purity and impurities. 
The Applicant has already agreed to supply these by Q2 2021.  
5.  The MAH should perform and document a gap analysis to identify any supplemental 
qualification needed to align the methods used for the DNA template control with ICH 
requirements. The gaps identified should be addressed either prior to transferring the methods 
to relevant sites or during the transfer activities.  
6.  The MAH should provide active substance process validation data regarding the finalised 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 39/140 
 
 
 
indirect filter qualification assessment and the shipping validation between sites.  
7.  The MAH should provide the results of the studies performed to enhance the robustness of the 
DNase digestion step.  
8.  The MAH should tighten the low limits of the proven acceptable ranges for the target volumes 
for ATP and CTP, to the levels needed to ensure a sufficiently high mRNA integrity in the active 
substance manufacturing process.  
9.  The MAH should comprehensively describe the capability of the next generation sequencing 
technology platform to detect lower amounts of RNA species of alternative sequence in the 
presence of the correct, more abundant RNA for the active substance.  
10. The MAH should discuss the results and the assay suitability for the cell-based flow cytometry 
and the western blot method used for biological characterization of protein expression for the 
active substance.  
11. The MAH should provide a summary of the validation/verification status of the immunoblot 
analytical procedure used to detect double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in BNT162b2 active 
substance. 
12. In order to improve the control strategy, the MAH should provide the protocol on preparation 
and qualification of future primary and working reference standards for the active substance.  
Finished Product  
13. The updated results from the finished product leachables studies should be provided for 
assessment.  
14. In order to ensure batch to batch consistency of the finished product the MAH should expand 
the description of the manufacturing process with more details. (1) When the batch size is 
twice the original one, the range number of active substance bags and active substance 
batches to be thawed, and the number of mixers should be stated. (2) The MAH should confirm 
the configuration of filters used in finished product manufacture. (3) The surface area of the 
sterile filter should be adapted to the batch size, unless otherwise justified; (4) process control 
for RNA content prior to dilution is important, particularly if several runs of TFF are performed 
in parallel with batch sizes 
15. Data on verification of in-process test methods should be provided for assessment during Q1 
2021.  
16. In order to improve the control strategy, the MAH should provide results of the validation plan 
phase 2 of the rapid sterility test for assessment before implementation.  
17. A risk assessment should be provided with respect to the potential presence of elemental 
impurities in the active product based on the general principles outlined in Section 5.1 of ICH 
Q3D and Ph. Eur. monograph Pharmaceutical Preparations (2619). A summary of this risk 
assessment should be submitted. The risk assessment should cover all relevant elements and 
sources in accordance with the guideline. The summary must enable a quantitative comparison 
of observed or predicted levels with the PDE’s given in the guideline. It should contain what is 
necessary to evaluate the appropriateness and completeness of the risk assessment, including 
any assumptions, calculations etc. made. The control strategy for elemental impurities should 
be justified based on the risk assessment.  
18. The MAH should provide the protocol on preparation and qualification of future primary and 
working reference materials for finished product testing. 
19. In order to provide further information regarding the stability of finished product, Results from 
photostability testing and temperature cycling studies of the finished product should be 
provided for assessment in Q1 2021.  
20. The applicant should provide the 6 months stability data for the finished product process 
performance qualification batches for assessment as soon as they are available.  
21. This applicant proposed change to the product information to indicate that up to 6 doses can 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 40/140 
 
 
 
be delivered from the vial was not considered acceptable as no supporting data was provided. 
In order to support such a change in the product information, a variation should be submitted 
to update the specification limits for extractable volume, supported by appropriate 
pharmaceutical development data to support the claim of 6 doses. 
22. The MAH should investigate the opportunities for an increased temperature at long term 
storage conditions for the finished product from -70 °C to -20 °C. In addition, the MAH should 
investigate the possibility to prolong the in-use storage time (before dilution) of 5 days at 2-8 
°C as well as the possibilities to extend the claims for transport conditions at 2-8 °C. 
23. The MAH should provide the results for assessment from the filter validation as soon as they 
are available. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
GLP inspections 
The pivotal toxicological studies are stated to be GLP compliant by the Applicant. There were some 
issues identified during the assessment with repeat-dose toxicity study #38166 regarding the 
documentation which have led to a study audit GLP inspection conducted by the local German GLP 
Compliance Monitoring Authority at the facility where the study was performed, in November 2020. All 
the answers to the issues were acknowledged by the CHMP. The Applicant gave also comments on 
these issues. In light of all the elements provided, the issues identified were considered resolved. 
With regard to repeat-dose toxicity study #20GR142 the only major concern identified was resolved 
with the answers from the Applicant that were considered satisfactory by the CHMP.  
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology dossier is based on initial studies of the functionality of the BNT162b2 (V9) RNA-
based product and the encoded SARS-CoV-2 P2 S protein as well as on supporting studies of SARS-
CoV-2 P2 S protein structure. This is followed by characterisation of the humoral and cellular immune 
response in mouse and nonhuman primate upon immunization with BNT162b2 (V9) and ends up with a 
SARS-CoV-2 challenge study of BNT162b2 (V9) immunized nonhuman primates.  
No secondary pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies 
have been conducted with BNT162b2 due to the nature of the RNA-based vaccine product, which is 
according to applicable guidelines (WHO guideline on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines, WHO Technical 
Report Series, No. 927, 2005). 
Mechanism of action 
SARS-CoV-2 infects the body by the use of the Spike protein (S) to attach to specific cell surface 
receptors, of which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may constitute a major part, as 
recently suggested. In addition to the initial attachment to a host cell, the S protein is also responsible 
for viral envelope fusion with the host cell membrane resulting in genome release. Due to its 
indispensable role, the S protein is a major target of virus neutralizing antibodies and has become a 
key antigen for vaccine development. By immunisation with the modified RNA (modRNA) product 
BNT162b2, encoding for the S protein, the intention is to trigger a strong and relatively long-lasting 
production of high affinity virus neutralizing antibodies, which can act through blocking the S-protein 
and it’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with host cell receptors but also by opsonisation 
mediated virus clearance. In addition, the immunisation with BNT162b2 is also intended to elicit a 
concomitant T cell response of the Th1 type, supporting the B cells responsible for the production of S-
specific antibodies and cytotoxic T cells that kill virus infected cells. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 41/140 
 
 
 
The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation 
before engaging with a target cell. BNT162b2 encodes a P2 mutant (P2 S) variant of S where two 
consecutive proline mutations have been introduced in order to lock the RBD in the prefusion 
conformation. In addition, BNT162b2 is nucleoside-modified by a substitution of 1-methyl-
pseudouridine for uridine and thus its inherent adjuvant activity mediated by binding to innate immune 
sensors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8, is dampened, but not abrogated. Furthermore, the 
structural elements of the vector backbones of the BNT162b2 are optimised for prolonged and strong 
translation of the antigen-encoding RNA.  
The potency of the RNA vaccine is further optimised by encapsulation of the RNA into lipid nano 
particles (LNPs), which protects the RNA from degradation by RNAses and enable transfection of host 
cells after intramuscular (i.m.) delivery. The functional and ionizable lipid, ALC-0315, is identified as 
the primary driver of delivery as it allows the LNPs to have a neutral charge in a physiological 
environment to facilitate internalization; the endosomal environment exhibits a positive charge and 
therefore triggers the translocation of RNA into the cytosol (Midoux & Pichon, 2015; Hassett et al, 
2019; Patel et al, 2019); ALC-0159 is included in the formulation to provide a steric barrier to: 1) 
facilitate the control of particle size and homogeneity during manufacturing and product storage, and 
2) regulate the association of plasma and proteins with the LNP surface. The composition of the LNPs 
may also affect the distribution of injected BNT162b2. In addition, it cannot be excluded the LNP 
composition contributes to the overall immunogenicity. 
Administration of LNP-formulated RNA vaccines IM results in transient local inflammation that drives 
recruitment of neutrophils and antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the site of delivery. Recruited APCs 
are capable of LNP uptake and protein expression and can subsequently migrate to the local draining 
lymph nodes where T cell priming occurs. In general, following endocytosis of LNPs, the mRNA is 
released from the endosome into the host cell cytosol (Sahay et al, 2010; Maruggi et al, 2019). The 
process of an RNA vaccine-elicited immune response has been demonstrated in both murine and 
nonhuman primate models (Pardi et al, 2015; Liang et al, 2017). 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies in vitro 
To confirm the functionality of the BNT162b2 (V9) RNA-based product, protein expression, transfection 
frequency from BNT162b2 and cell surface expression of the SARS-CoV-2 P2 S protein antigen was 
assessed. BNT162b2 (V9) transfection of HEK293T cells indicated SARS-CoV-2 P2 S was correctly 
expressed on the cell surface, as indicated by flow cytometry staining of non-permeabilized cells with 
an anti-S1 monoclonal antibody. In addition, the cellular localisation of expressed S1 protein was 
investigated. The S protein co-localized with an ER marker, as detected by immunofluorescence 
experiments in HEK293T cells expressing BNT162b2-RNA, suggesting the S protein is processed within 
the ER.  
In a set of supportive studies, it was investigated whether BNT162b2 RNA encodes for an amino acid 
sequence that authentically express the ACE2 binding site (RBD). Recombinant P2 S was expressed 
from DNA encoding for the same amino acid sequence as BNT162b2 RNA encodes for. Flow cytometry 
staining with spike protein (S) binding agents, as human ACE2 and monoclonal antibodies known to 
bind to authentic S-protein all indicated an authentically presented P2 S protein and ACE2 binding site. 
Low nanomolar affinity of P2 S binding to ACE2 PD and B38 mAb was demonstrated with the use of 
biolayer Interferometry. 
To further structurally characterize the P2 spike protein, a cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) 
investigation of purified P2 S, expressed from DNA, was conducted. The cryoEM revealed, according to 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 42/140 
 
 
 
the Applicant, a particle population closely resembling the prefusion conformation of SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein. By fitting a previously published atomic model on to a processed and refined cryoEM dataset, 
a rebuilt model was obtained showing good agreement with reported structures of prefusion full-length 
wild type S and its ectodomain with P2 mutations. In the prefusion state the RBD undergo hinge-like 
conformational movements and can either be in an “up” position (open for receptor binding) or in a 
“down” position (closed for receptor binding). Three-dimensional classification of the dataset showed a 
class of particles that was in the conformation one RBD ‘up’ and two RBD ‘down”. This partly open 
conformation represented 20.4% of the trimeric molecules. The remainder were in the all RBD ‘down’ 
conformation. Although potent neutralizing epitopes have been described when the RBD is in the 
“heads down” closed conformation, the “heads up” receptor accessible conformation exposes a 
potentially greater breadth of neutralizing antibody targets. It is concluded that antibodies to both the 
up and down conformations will potentially be formed upon immunisation with the P2 S encoding 
BNT162b2. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies in vivo 
The humoral and cellular immune response following IM administration of BNT162b2 (V9) was 
investigated in mice and nonhuman primates. The choice and relevance of the mouse for 
pharmacological animal model studies was based on the in-depth knowledge about the suitability, 
dosing and immunization regimen of BALB/c mice for RNA-based vaccine development. Non-human 
primates were chosen as they are a higher-ordered species, more closely related to humans, which 
may better reflect immune responses in humans. The selection of rats as the toxicology test species is 
consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidance documents on nonclinical evaluation of 
vaccines (WHO, 2005). The documents recommend conducting vaccine toxicity studies in a species 
which mounts an immune response to the vaccine. The Wistar Han (WH) rat developed an antigen-
specific immune response following BNT162b2 vaccination. 
Balb/c, females were immunized IM on day 0 with 0.2, 1 or 5 µg RNA/animal of BNT162b2 (V9), or 
with buffer alone (n=8). Blood samples were collected on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after immunization. 
The IgG antibody response to SARS-CoV-2- RBD or S1 was analysed by ELISA. Immunization with 
BNT162b2 induced IgGs that bound to S1 and RBD, as detected by ELISA, and on day 28 after 
immunization showed a binding affinity of KD 12 nM or 0.99 nM (geometric mean) respectively, as 
detected by surface plasmon resonance.  
To further characterise the antibody response to BNT162b2 and its potential capacity to reduce SARS-
CoV-2 infections, a pseudo virus type neutralization assay (pVNT) was used as a surrogate of virus 
neutralization since studies with authentic SARS-CoV-2 requires a BSL3 containment. The pVNT was 
based on a recombinant replication-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector that had been 
pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein according to published protocols. A dose-dependent increases 
in SARS-CoV-2-S VSV pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies were observed in sera from BNT162b2-
immunized mice. On day 14, the difference of the group treated with 5 µg RNA compared to the buffer 
control was statistically significant (p = 0.0010). On days 21 and 28, the differences of the groups 
treated with 1 µg and 5 µg BNT162b2 compared to the buffer control were statistically significant. The 
relevance of the pseudovirus assay for authentic SARS-CoV-2 was not discussed. For technical 
reasons, it was not possible to determine a ratio of neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibodies. 
Immunisation of mice with BNT162b2 also induced IFN-γ secreting cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cell subsets. This was shown by ELISPOT after ex vivo re-stimulation of splenocytes with an S-
protein overlapping peptide pool Day 28 after immunization. Cytokine profiling was also carried out by 
Multiplex analysis of cytokine release from the Day 28 Splenocytes. High levels of the Th1 cytokines 
IFNγ and IL-2 but minute amounts of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were detected after re-
stimulation with S but not RBD overlapping peptide mix. The much higher immune cellular responses 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 43/140 
 
 
 
elicited against the S1 protein compared to the RBD domain could be explained by the presence of 
significantly more T cell epitopes in the larger full-length S peptide mix (in addition, S1 covers the RBD 
domain). It should be emphasized that cellular immune reactivity is much more important against S1 
than against the RBD domain, where neutralizing antibodies are more important to the latter. In 
addition, an elevated secretion of TNFα, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-18 was recorded after re-
stimulation. In order to characterize the immunophenotype of B-and T-cells appearing in lymph nodes 
from mice immunized with BNT162b2 (V9), B- and T-cell subsets in draining lymph node cells were 
quantified by flow cytometry 12 days after immunization. Higher numbers of B cells were observed in 
the samples from mice that received BNT162b2 compared to controls. That included plasma cells, class 
switched IgG1- and IgG2a-positive B cells, and germinal centre B cells. T-cell counts were elevated, 
particularly numbers of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, including subsets with ICOS upregulation, which 
play an essential role in the formation of germinal centres (Hutloff 2015). 
In the nonhuman primate (rhesus macaques) studies, BNT162b2 (V9) was shown to be immunogenic 
after intramuscular administration. The serum concentrations of both S1-binding and the SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing antibody titres were at least an order of magnitude higher after BNT162b2 immunization 
of rhesus macaques than for the panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human sera. In this study, total 
antibody response is measured using a luminex assay and results expressed on U/ml and for the 
neutralization assay results are expressed in VNT 50. 
Antigen specific S-reactive T-cell response after BNT162b2 immunization of the macaques was 
measured by ELISPOT and ICS. While S-specific T cells were low to undetectable in naïve animals, 
strong IFNγ but minimal IL-4 ELISpot responses were detected after the second 30 or 100 µg dose of 
the BNT162b2. Intra cellular staining (ICS) confirmed that BNT162b2 immunization elicited strong S-
specific IFNγ producing T cell responses, including a higher frequency of CD4+ T cells that produced 
IFNγ, IL-2, or TNF-alpha but a lower frequency of CD4+ cells that produce IL-4. An S-specific IFNγ 
producing CD8+ T cell response was also recorded.  
A challenge study in rhesus macaques was conducted as nonclinical proof of concept (PoC). Rhesus 
macaques share a 100% homology with the human ACE2 sequence that interacts with the RBD of the 
S protein. BNT162b2 (V9) immunized macaques were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 intra nasally and 
intratracheally 55 days after the second immunization with BNT162b2. Rhesus macaques were 
immunized on days 0 and 21, in order to align with the clinical vaccination regimen. Some other 
COVID-19 vaccine candidates have different prime-boost intervals, such as 4 weeks for both ChAdOx1 
(Graham et al., 2020) and mRNA-1273 (Corbett et al., 2020). At the time of challenge, SARS-CoV-2 
neutralising titres ranged from 260 to 1,004 in the BNT162b2 (V9)-immunized animals. Neutralising 
titres were undetectable in animals from the control-immunized and sentinel groups. The presence of 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was monitored by nasal and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL). Viral RNA was detected in BAL fluid from 2 of the 3 control-immunized macaques on Day 3 after 
challenge and from 1 of 3, on Day 6. At no time point sampled was viral RNA detected in BAL fluid 
from the BNT162b2 (V9)-immunized and SARS-CoV-2 challenged macaques. The difference in viral 
RNA detection in BAL fluid between BNT162b2-immunized and control-immunized rhesus macaques 
after challenge is statistically significant (p=0.0014). From control-immunized macaques, viral RNA 
was detected in nasal swabs obtained on Days 1, 3, and 6 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge; from 
BNT162b2 (V9)-immunized macaques, viral RNA was detected only in nasal swabs obtained on Day 1 
after challenge and not in swabs obtained on Day 3 or subsequently. The pattern of viral RNA detection 
from OP swabs was similar to that for nasal swabs. No signs of viral RNA detected vaccine-elicited 
disease enhancement were observed. The viral RNA levels between control-immunized and BNT162b2-
immunized animals after challenge were compared by a non-parametric analysis (Friedman’s test), and 
the p-values are 0.0014 for BAL fluid, 0.2622 for nasal swabs, and 0.0007 for OP swabs.  
Assessment report

Despite the presence of viral RNA in BAL fluid from challenged control animals, none of the challenged 
animals, immunized or control, showed clinical signs of illness (weight change, body temperature 
change, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate). The Applicant concluded, the absence of clinical signs 
in any of the challenged animals, immunised or control, despite the presence of viral RNA in BAL fluid 
from challenged control animals, indicates that the 2-4 year old male rhesus monkey challenge model 
appears to be an infection model, but not a clinical disease model. However, a further investigation by 
lung radiograph and computerized tomography (CT) was conducted. Radiographic evidence of 
pulmonary abnormality was observed in challenged controls but not in unchallenged sentinels nor in 
challenged BNT162b2-immunized animals except for a CT-score signal in 1 of 6 pre infection and 2 out 
of six at Day 10/EOP in BNT162b immunised animals. The CT score signal was at the same level as the 
control at Day 10/EOP. No radiographic evidence of vaccine-elicited enhanced disease was observed.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted with BNT162b2, which is acceptable to the 
CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology studies 
No safety pharmacology studies were conducted with BNT162b2. The Applicant refers to that they are 
not considered necessary according to the WHO guideline (WHO, 2005). In addition, no findings on 
vital organ functions have been recorded in the repeat dose toxicology studies. Thus, the absence of 
safety pharmacology studies is endorsed by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies 
No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were conducted with BNT162b2. This is agreeable to 
the CHMP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has determined the pharmacokinetics of the two novel LNP excipients ALC-0315 
(aminolipid) and ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid) in plasma and liver as well as their elimination and metabolism 
in rats. Furthermore, the Applicant has studied the biodistribution of the two novel lipids (in rats) and 
the biodistribution of a LNP-formulated surrogate luciferase RNA in mice (IV), as well as the 
biodistribution of a [3H]-Labelled Lipid Nanoparticle-mRNA Formulation in rats (IM). 
No traditional pharmacokinetic or biodistribution studies have been performed with the vaccine 
candidate BNT162b2.  
In study PF-07302048_06Jul20_072424, the applicant has used a qualified LC-MS/MS method to 
support quantitation of the two novel LNP excipients. The bioanalysis methods appear to be adequately 
characterized and validated for use in the GLP studies. 
PK studies with the two novel LNP-excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159:  
Wistar Han rats were IV bolus injected with LNP formulated luciferase-encoding RNA at 1 mg/kg and 
ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 concentrations at 15,3 mg/kg and 1,96 mg/kg respectively. ALC-0315 and 
ALC-0159 levels in plasma, liver, urine and faeces were analysed by LC-MS/MS at different time-points 
up to 2-weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 45/140 
 
 
 
ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 were rapidly cleared from plasma during the first 24 hours with an initial t½ 
of 1.62 and 1.72 h, respectively. 24 hours post-dosing, less than 1% of the maximum plasma 
concentrations remained. A slower clearance rate was observed after 24 hours with ALC-0315 and 
ALC-0159 terminal elimination t½ of 139 and 72.7 h, respectively. 
Following plasma clearance, the liver appears to be to major organ to which ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 
distribute. The applicant has estimated the percent of dose distributed to the liver to be ~60% for ALC-
0315 and ~20% for ALC-0159. The observed liver distribution is consistent with the observations from 
the biodistribution study and the repeat-dose toxicology, both using IM administration.  
For ALC-0315 (aminolipid), the maximum detected concentration in the liver (294 μg/g liver) was 
reached 3 hours after IV injection. ALC-0315 was eliminated slowly from the liver and after 2-weeks 
the concentration of ALC-0315 was still ~25% of the maximum concentration indicating that ALC-0315 
would be eliminated from rat liver in approximately 6-weeks. For ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid), the maximum 
detected concentration in the liver (15.2 μg/g liver) was reached 30 minutes following IV injection. 
ALC-0159, was eliminated from the liver faster than ALC-0315 and after 2-weeks the concentration of 
ALC-0159 was only ~0,04% of the maximum detected concentration. The applicant was asked to 
discuss the long half-life of ALC-0315 and its effect, discussion on the comparison with patisiran, as 
well as the impact on the boosts and post treatment contraception duration. The applicant considered 
that there were no non-clinical safety issues based on the repeat dose toxicity studies at doses (on a 
mg/kg basis) much greater than administered to humans; this was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Both patisaran lipids showed an essentially similar PK profile in clinic with a strongly biphasic profile 
and long terminal half-lives.  According to the applicant, it is difficult to further contextualize the 
pharmacokinetic data and therefore to understand the safety of these molecules, beyond consideration 
of dose. There is a large dose differential between the human BNT162b2 dose and the dose used in the 
toxicity studies (300-1000x) which provides an acceptable safety margin. 
Moreover, according to the Applicant given the large difference in dose between the toxicity studies 
and the clinically efficacious dose (300-1000x), it is unlikely that the administration of a booster dose 
will lead to significant accumulation. Finally, the applicant is of the opinion that these results support 
no requirements for contraception. The CHMP found this position agreeable.  
While there was no detectable excretion of either lipid in the urine, the percent of dose excreted 
unchanged in faeces was ~1% for ALC-0315 and ~50% for ALC-0159. 
Biodistribution of a LNP-formulated luciferase surrogate reporter:  
To determine the biodistribution of the LNP-formulated modRNA, the applicant did study distribution of 
the modRNA in two different non-GLP studies, in mice and rats, determined the biodistribution of a 
surrogate luciferase modRNA formulated with a LNP with identical lipid composition used in BNT162b2 
(mouse study) or the biodistribution of a [3H]-Labelled Lipid Nanoparticle-mRNA Formulation (rat 
study). 
The mouse study used three female BALB-c mice per group and luciferase protein expression was 
determined by in vivo bioluminescence readouts using an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) following 
injection of the luciferase substrate luciferine. The readouts were performed at 6h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 6d 
and 9d post IM injection (intended clinical route) in the right and left hind leg with each 1 μg (total of 
2μg) of LNP-formulated luciferase RNA.  
In vivo luciferase expression was detected at different timepoints at the injection sites and in the liver 
region indicating drainage to the liver. As expected with an mRNA product, the luciferase expression 
was transient and decreased over time. Luciferase signals at the injection sites, most likely reflecting 
distribution to the lymph nodes draining the injection sites, peaked 6h post injection with signals of 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 46/140 
 
 
 
approximately 10 000 times of buffer control animals. The signal decreased slowly during the first 72 
hours and after 6 and 9 days the signals were further weakened to approximately levels of 18 and 7 
times the signals obtained from animals injected with buffer control.  
The signals from the liver region peaked 6h post injection and decreased to background levels 48h 
after injection. The liver expression is also supportive of the data from the rat PK study and the 
findings in the rat repeat-dose toxicological study showing reversible liver vacuolation and increased 
γGGT levels. 
The biodistribution was also studied in rats using radiolabeled LNP and luciferase modRNA (study 
185350). The radiolabeling data, measuring distribution to blood, plasma and selected tissues, of IM 
injection of a single dose of 50 μg mRNA over a 48-hour period is considered more sensitive than the 
bioluminescence method and indicate a broader biodistribution pattern than was observed with 
bioluminescence. Over 48 hours, distribution from the injection site to most tissues occurred, with the 
majority of tissues exhibiting low levels of radioactivity.  
Radioactivity was detected in most tissues from the first time point (0.25 h) and results support that 
injections site and the liver are the major sites of distribution. The greatest mean concentration was 
found remaining in the injection site at each time point in both sexes. Low levels of radioactivity were 
detected in most tissues, with the greatest levels in plasma observed 1-4 hours post-dose. Over 48 
hours, distribution was mainly observed to liver, adrenal glands, spleen and ovaries, with maximum 
concentrations observed at 8-48 hours post-dose. Total recovery (% of injected dose) of radiolabeled 
LNP+modRNA outside the injection site was greatest in the liver (up to 21.5%) and was much less in 
spleen (≤1.1%), adrenal glands (≤0.1%) and ovaries (≤0.1%). The mean concentrations and tissue 
distribution pattern were broadly similar between the sexes. No evidence of vaccine-related 
macroscopic or microscopic findings were found in the ovaries in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
(Study 38166 and Study 20GR142) and no effects on fertility were identified in the DART study. 
Immunogenicity of a LNP formulated luciferase modRNA:  
Activation of the innate immune system following IM injection of a LNP-formulated luciferase reporter 
RNA into mice was assessed in a Luminex-based multiplex assay were serum samples (day -1 (pre), 6 
h and day 9) were tested for levels of the following chemokines and cytokines: MCP-1, MIP-1β, TNF-α, 
IFN-α, IFN- γ, IL-2, Il-6, IL-10, IL1-β, IP-10. The applicant tested 3 different LNPs, all formulated 
together with luciferase RNA. The results suggest that the LNP formulation used in BNT162b2 (LNP8) 
slightly increased levels of MCP-1, IL-6, and IP-10 at 6h post immunisation. All chemokine/cytokine 
levels dropped to background levels at day 9.  
In addition to innate immune activation, LNP formulated luciferase modRNA was able to induce IFN-γ 
T-cell responses (when challenged with  MHC I-specific luciferase peptide pools) measured in 
splenocytes isolated from the mice at day 9.The LNP formulated luciferase modRNA did not induce the 
formation of luciferase-specific IgGs as measured by ELISA. 
In an additional hPBMC study (R-20-0357), overall, low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-
6, IFNγ, IL-1β) and low or medium levels of chemokines (IP-10, MIP-1β, MCP-1) were secreted when 
assayed in an exploratory in vitro reactogenicity assay using human PBMCs from three donors. IP-10, 
MIP-1b, MCP-1 were seen to be increased among donors, because of transfection of antigen presenting 
cells after infection. 
Metabolism of the two novel LNP-excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159:  
Metabolism studies were conducted to evaluate the two novel lipids in the LNP, ALC-0315 (aminolipid) 
and ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid). No metabolic studies were performed with the modRNA or the other two 
lipids of the LNP.  Overall, it seems as both ALC-0159 and ALC-0315 are metabolised by hydrolytic 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 47/140 
 
 
 
metabolism of the amide or ester functionalities, respectively, and this hydrolytic metabolism is 
observed across the species evaluated.  
The metabolism of the novel excipients, ALC-0159 and ALC-0315, were examined in vitro using blood, 
liver S9 fractions and hepatocytes, all from mouse, rat, monkey and human. The in vivo metabolism 
was examined in rat plasma, urine, faeces, and liver from a rat pharmacokinetics study where a 
luciferase-encoding modRNA formulated in an LNP was used. 
Metabolism of ALC-0315 appears to occur via two sequential ester hydrolysis reactions, first yielding 
the monoester metabolite followed by the doubly de-esterified metabolite. The monoester metabolite 
was observed in vitro in rat blood, monkey S9 fraction, and in vivo in rat plasma and rat liver. The 
doubly de-esterified metabolite was observed in vitro in mouse and rat blood; monkey liver S9 
fraction; and in vivo in rat plasma, urine, faeces and liver. Subsequent metabolism of the doubly de-
esterified metabolite resulted in a glucuronide metabolite which was observed in urine only from the 
rat pharmacokinetics study. Additionally, 6-hexyldecanoic acid, the acid product of both hydrolysis 
reactions of ALC-0315, was identified in vitro in mouse and rat blood; mouse, rat, monkey and human 
hepatocytes; mouse, rat and human liver S9 fractions; and in vivo in rat plasma. 
ALC-0315 was stable over 120 min (>93% remaining) in liver microsomes and S9 fractions and over 
240 min (>93% remaining) in hepatocytes in all species and test systems. 
The primary route of metabolism for ALC-0159 appears to involve amide bond hydrolysis yielding N,N-
ditetradecylamine. This metabolite was identified in mouse and rat blood as well as hepatocytes and 
liver S9 from mouse, rat, monkey and human.  
ALC-0159 was stable over 120 min (>82% remaining) in liver microsomes and S9 fractions and over 
240 min (>87% remaining) in hepatocytes in all species and test systems.  
Excretion of the two novel LNP-excipients ALC-0315 and ALC-0159:  
Excretion of the two novel lipids in the LNP, ALC-0315 (aminolipid) and ALC-0159 (PEG-lipid) was 
studied in the rat PK study.  No excretion studies were performed with the modRNA or the other two 
lipids of the LNP which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
While there was no detectable excretion of either lipid in the urine, the percent of dose excreted 
unchanged in faeces was ~1% for ALC-0315 and ~50% for ALC-0159. Since almost no unchanged 
ALC-3015 was detected in urine or faeces, metabolism may play a bigger role in the elimination of 
ALC-0315 than ALC-0159. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological dossier for BNT162b2 is based on a total of three pivotal toxicological experimental 
studies; two repeat-dose toxicity rat studies and one DART fertility-EFD rat study. The test substance 
in the repeat-dose toxicity studies is BNT162b2 (100 µg of variant 8 in one study (study 38166) and 
30 µg of the clinically relevant variant 9 in the second study (study 20GR142)), which consists of a 
modified RNA in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. The differences between the variants are due to 
codon optimization. The LNP contains four excipients whereof two are considered novel (ALC-0315 and 
ALC-0159).   
Repeat dose toxicity 
The two general/repeat-dose toxicity studies involved IM exposure of Han Wistar rats to BNT162b2 for 
a total of 17 days (three weekly administrations) followed by three weeks of recovery. Overall, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 48/140 
 
 
 
study designs only included a single experimental group each with a variant of BNT162b2 (V8 or V9 
variant), with no dose-response assessment or specific experimental groups for the LNP alone or its 
novel excipients. No test substance-linked mortality or clinical signs were observed (except a slight 
increase [<1C] in body temperature). No ophthalmological and auditory effects were found. The animal 
model of choice, the rat, has not been assessed in the pharmacological dossier but a limited 
absorption/distribution study has been conducted in pharmacokinetics dossier. Immunogenicity was 
assessed in the toxicology studies.  
Body weight and food intake: Exposure generated a slight reduction of absolute BW statistically 
significant at D9 (-6.8% to -11.3%; BNT162b2 V8) alternatively a weak body weight increase 
reduction [BNT162b2 v9]. No changes in food intake were observed.  
Gross pathology and organ weights: At 100ug BNT162b2 V8 and 30ug BNT162b2 V9, the tissue at the 
injection site was thickened/enlarged with oedema and erythema at the end of exposure in a reversible 
manner. The spleen was enlarged (reversible) with up to 60% for both vaccine variants and doses. 
There was also an enlargement of the draining and inguinal lymph nodes at 100ug (BNT162b2 V8). 
Overall, there were signs of a significant immune response which is likely linked to the test substance. 
There was a trend of slightly enlarged liver in females at 100ug (BNT162b2 V8) but not at 30ug 
(BNT162b2 V9).    
Histopathology: At 100ug BNT162b2 V8, there were observations of various inflammatory signs at the 
injection  site  (e.g.  fibrosis,  myofiber  degeneration,  oedema,  subcutis  inflammation  and  epidermis 
hyperplasia). Also, there was inflammation of the perineural tissue of the sciatic nerve and surrounding 
bone  in  most  rats  at  d17.  The  bone  marrow  demonstrated  increased  cellularity  and  the  lymph  nodes 
showed  plasmacytosis,  inflammation  and  increased  cellularity.  The  spleen  demonstrated  increased 
haematopoiesis in half the animals at d17. The liver showed hepatocellular periportal vacuolation at d17 
(fully reversed during recovery) which may be related to hepatic clearance of ALC0315. Histopathology 
assessment of 30ug BNT162b2 V9 generated similar results as 100ug BNT162b2 V8 although not on as 
extensive  level  (possibly  due  to  a  lesser  dose).  Minimal  to  moderate  inflammation  and  oedema  was 
observed at the injection site (usually resolved after ~3d). There was minimal to moderate increased 
plasma  cell  cellularity  in  the  lymph  nodes  and  germinal  center  cellularity  plus  hematopoietic  cell 
cellularity in the spleen at d17 (reversible at end of recovery). There was minimal increase cellularity in 
the bone marrow. Reversible vacuolisation in the liver was also observed.  
The Applicant explained that peri-portal liver vacuolization was observed in both pivotal studies but are 
not  related  to  any  microscopic  evidence  of  liver/biliary  injury  in  animals  (cellular  hypertrophy, 
inflammation) nor any clinical data from Phase 1 study. Vacuoles are considered by the Applicant to be 
a result of ALC-0315 accumulation in liver and not PEG.  
A novel finding at 30ug was minimal extra-capsular inflammation in the joints at d17. 
Moreover,  increases  in  neutrophils,  monocytes,  eosinophils  and  basophils  were  observed  in  study 
20GR142. For the Applicant, increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils observed in 
the  Study  20GR142  were  related  to  the  inflammatory/immune  response  to  BNT162b2  administration. 
Similar  findings  were  also  identified  in  Study  38166  in  animals  administered  100  μg  BNT162b2.  The 
applicant  stated  that  the  increases  in  eosinophils  and  basophils  are  a  minor  component  of  the 
inflammatory leukogram, which is dominated by increases in neutrophils. The applicant also informed 
that  characterisation  of  large  unstained  cells  was  not  conducted  since  the  identification  of  these  cells 
does not provide additional information. The CHMP found this agreeable.   
Immunogenicity: Treatment of rats with 100 ug BNT162b2 V8 generated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

rats with 30 ug BNT162b2 V9 generated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (not a pseudovirus 
neutralization assay). 
Haematology: At 30ug BNT162b2 V9 and 100ug BNT162b2 V8, there was a moderate to strong 
reduction of reticulocytes (48-74%, not specified for V9) coupled to lowered red cell mass parameters 
(RBC, HGB, and HCT). There was a moderate to strong increase (>100%) in large unclassified cells 
[LUC], neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and fibrinogen that may be related to the 
inflammatory/immune response. The changes were reversible. No effects on coagulation were 
observed for V8 whereas a slight increase in fibrinogen was observed with V8 and V9. 
Clinical pathology: A very strong but reversible increase (>100%) in pro-inflammatory acute phase 
proteins in the blood (A1AGP, A2M) was seen with both 30ug BNT162b2 V9 and 100ug BNT162b2 V8. 
Also, indicative of pro-inflammation, a slight to moderate reduced albumin/globulin ratio was seen for 
both variants. V8 (100ug) exposure generated increased levels of γGT (>200%) and increased γGT 
enzyme activity and increased AST levels (+ ~19%). V9 (30ug) exposure led to slight to moderate 
increases in AST and ALP levels (+20-100%), possible indicative of liver effects but no changes in γGT 
levels. There were no changes in cytokine levels (IFNγ, TNFalpha, Il-1b, Il6, Il-10) after 100ug V8 
exposure (not measured for V9). For 100ug V8, there were no changes measured in urine whereas 
there was a slight-moderate reduction in pH for 30ug V9.  
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been provided. This is acceptable as the components of the vaccine 
formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
The novel excipient ALC-0159 contains a potential acetamide moiety. Risk assessment performed by the 
Applicant indicates that the risk of genotoxicity relating to this excipient is very low based on literature 
data  where  acetamide  genotoxicity  is  associated  with  high  doses  and  chronic  administration  (≥1000 
mg/kg/day).  Since  the  amount  of  ALC-0159  excipient  in  the  finished  product  is  low  (50  µg/dose),  its 
clearance  is  high  and  only  two  administrations  of  the  product  are  recommended  for  humans,  the 
genotoxicity risk is expected to be very low.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
In the DART study, the test substances used were BNT162b1, BNT162b2 and BNT162b3, which were 
given to female rats twice before the start of mating and twice during gestation at the human clinical 
dose (30 µg RNA/dosing day). The test substances were administered intramuscularly (IM) to F0 
female Wistar rats 21 and 14 days before the start of mating (M-21 and M-14, respectively) and then 
on Gestation Day (GD) 9 and GD20, for a total of 4 doses. A subgroup was terminated at GD21 and 
another (litter) group was terminated at PND21. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers were found in 
the majority of females just prior to mating (M-14), in most females and foetuses at the end of 
gestation (GD21), and in most offspring at the end of lactation (PND21). There was transient reduced 
body weight gain and food consumption after each dose. No effects on the estrous cycle or fertility 
index were observed. There was an increase (~2x) of pre-implantation loss (9.77%, compared to 
control 4.09%) although this was within historical control data range (5.1%-11.5%). Among foetuses 
(from a total of n=21 dams/litters), there was a very low incidence of gastroschisis, mouth/jaw 
malformations, right sided aortic arch, and cervical vertebrae abnormalities, although these findings 
were within historical control data. Regarding skeletal findings, the exposed group had comparable to 
control group levels of presacral vertebral arches supernumerary lumbar ribs, supernumerary lumbar 
short ribs, caudal vertebrae number < 5). There were no signs of adverse effects on the postnatal

pups (terminated at PND21). It is noted that there is currently no available data on the placental transfer 
of BNT162b2. This information is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies have been conducted; however the assessment of local tolerance 
was performed in repeat-dose toxicity studies. At 100ug BNT162b2 V8, there was mostly slight to 
moderate oedemas but in some cases severe oedema. The severity increased with the 2nd and 3rd 
injections. The data for 30ug BNT162b2 V9 exposure indicated less severe but similar effects.   
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 Corr 2), due to their nature vaccines and lipids are unlikely 
to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are 
not provided in this Application for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The proposed medicinal product is composed of a modRNA formulated with functional and structural 
lipids forming lipid nano particles (LNPs), the latter having the purpose to protect the modRNA from 
degradation and enable transfection of the modRNA into host cells after IM injection. The composition 
of the LNPs is likely to affect the distribution of injected BNT162b2. In addition, it cannot be excluded 
the LNP composition contributes to the overall immunogenicity (see also toxicology below).  
The general immune activating mode of action of LNP-formulated RNA vaccines have been described in 
the literature. The administration of LNP-formulated RNA results in transient local inflammation that 
drives recruitment of neutrophils and antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the site of delivery. Recruited 
APCs are capable of LNP uptake and protein expression and can subsequently migrate to the local 
draining lymph nodes where T cell priming occurs. In general, following endocytosis of LNPs, the mRNA 
is released from the endosome into the host cell cytosol (Sahay et al, 2010; Maruggi et al, 2019). The 
process of an RNA vaccine-elicited immune response has been demonstrated in both murine and 
nonhuman primate models (Pardi et al, 2015; Liang et al, 2017).  
Whether other cells than professional APCs may transiently express the vaccine derived spike protein 
and therefore from a theoretical point of view, as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, also could 
potentially be targets for previously primed spike protein reactive cytotoxic T cells, if present, is not 
known. However, no overt signs of such adverse pharmacological responses have been recorded in the 
repeat dose toxicity study or in the clinical trials. In the clinical trial, a second dose was administered 
to patients who had been immunologically primed by the first dose. Moreover, in the clinical trials it 
appeared around 270 patients that was shown to have been seropositive for SARS-COV-2 before 
vaccination. In these cases, the expression of the spike protein on host cells occurred in the presence 
of a primed immune response to the spike protein but no overt adverse pharmacological response has 
been observed. The low amount of vaccine product in a single dose may limit the distribution of 
modRNA/LNP mainly to the injection site and to migrating APCs. Due to the transient expression of the 
modRNA, no persistent expression is expected. 
Regarding the structural and biophysical characterization of the modRNA, a schematic description 
shows that 5 different sequences are included in the BNT162b2, of which two being coding sequences.

Concerning the protein expression obtained from the V8 and V9 variants, specific immune responses 
(total IgG binding Ab + neutralizing Ab) were obtained at significant levels against the Spike S protein 
in animals with both variants (in mice and rats), indicating the efficiency of the in vivo expression of 
Spike S protein. An additional study was provided (R-20-0360) further demonstrating in vitro protein 
expression. Transfection efficiency, expression rate and cellular viability were analysed in HEK293T 
cells, upon transfection with different constructs (saRNA, uRNA, modRNA V8 and V9). HEK293T cells 
were efficiently transfected by both modRNA V8 and modRNA V9 with higher transfection rate for V9, 
but quite similar the expression rate by V8 and V9. 
Although some of the structural and biophysical characterization of P2 S as a vaccine antigen has been 
provided, it was investigated in supportive studies based on P2S expressed from DNA and not the 
product modRNA. While it is not considered to be of critical importance for the assessment in this 
procedure, it still provides a scientific understanding supporting the nonclinical key studies of humoral 
and cellular immune response, including SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as SARS-CoV-2 
challenge nonclinical PoC. 
In-vivo pharmacodynamics: The humoral and cellular immune response following IM administration of 
BNT162b2 (V9) was investigated in mice and nonhuman primates and was based on the in-depth 
knowledge about the suitability, dosing and immunization regimen of BALB/c mice for RNA-based 
vaccine development. Nonhuman primates were chosen as they are a higher-ordered species, more 
closely related to humans, which may better reflect immune responses in humans. This is accepted but 
a more in-depth discussion on the suitability of these pharmacological animal models have not been 
provided (e.g. susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and similarity to COVID 19 disease; potential 
bias for Th1- or Th2-skewed responses has been well characterized for certain mice strains). Only 
single immunisation was conducted in mice, as compared to the clinical 2-dose regimen, which was 
adequate since only characterization of the immune response, but no challenge study was carried out 
in mice. Also, no or limited attention to the induction of long-term memory responses nor 
immunogenicity and protection in aged animals has been paid. That being said, the induction of virus 
neutralizing antibodies in both mice (VSV-SARS-CoV-2 S) and primates (SARS-CoV-2) indicated that 
BNT162b2 immunization has the potential to induce neutralizing antibodies also in humans. Thus, 
vaccination with modRNA is expected to induce robust neutralising antibodies and a concomitant T cell 
response to achieve protective immunity.  
In mice, the immune response was assessed by single immunization only. Taking the phenotyping of B 
and T cells in aggregate, the data indicates a concurrent induction of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific 
neutralizing antibody titers and a Th1-driven T-cell response by immunization with BNT162b2 (this was 
also seen in nonhuman primates).  
Concerning the nonhuman primate (rhesus macaques) studies, the applicant considers the human 
convalescent serum panel as an assessable benchmark to judge the quality of the immune response to 
the vaccine; this is accepted by the CHMP.  
Concerning the characterization of the T cell responses, the Applicant suggests the S-specific IFNγ 
producing T cell responses, including a high frequency of CD4+ T cells that produced IFNγ, IL-2, or 
TNF-α but a low frequency of CD4+ cells that produce IL-4, indicates a Th1-biased response occurred 
after the BNT162b2 (V9) immunization. This reasoning appears acceptable to the CHMP. The role of 
such a Th1 biased response was put in the context of antigen-specific T-cell responses playing an 
important role in generation of antigen-specific antibody response as well as in elimination of infected 
cells to mediate protection against disease.  
When immunised macaques were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a clear and statistically significant 
effect was observed on reduced presence of viral RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and 
oropharyngeal (OP) swabs. A clear effect was also recorded by blinded X ray scoring of the lungs. A 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020

protective effect is also evident in the CT score Day 3 after challenge, however at Day 10/EOP, there 
was a CT signal in 2 out of six BNT162b immunized monkeys at the same level as observed in the 
control group. That signal is of unclear significance since also in 1 out of 6 pre infection BNT162b 
immunized animals a similar CT-score signal was observed. During this time period the SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing GMT in the BNT162b2-immunised rhesus macaques continued to decrease but remained 
above the GMT of a human convalescent serum panel. 
In conclusion of the preclinical pharmacology, the presented data, including immunogenicity, triggering 
of neutralizing antibodies and Th1 response and reduced presence of viral RNA in challenged animals 
as well as radiological lung parameters, provide support for the vaccination approach. Due to species 
differences in the immune system between animal model species and humans, the conclusion whether 
this candidate vaccine will be sufficiently effective in humans needs to be established in clinical studies. 
Pharmacokinetic 
Pharmacokinetic (regarding the two novel LNP excipients): The two novel lipid excipients play different 
roles in the formulation and have different pharmacokinetics. It is worth to notice that the lipid 
displaying a persistent kinetic over time in liver is ALC-0315. 
ALC-0159 is comprised of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) headgroup (~2000 M.Wt.) attached to hydrophobic 
carbon  chains  (ie,  the  lipid  anchor).  ALC-0159  is  present  in  BNT162  at  a  low  mol%  (<2  mol%),  and 
therefore  dose,  relative  to  the  other  lipids.  PEGylated  lipid  can  exchange  out  of  the  LNP  after 
administration,  thus  allowing  the  desired  binding  of  endogenous  proteins  (eg,  Apolipoprotein  E)  and 
removing  the  steric  barrier  that  would  otherwise  restrict  interactions  of  the  LNP  with  target  cells  and 
proteins. 
ALC-0315 is an ionizable aminolipid in BNT162b2 and is the most important lipid component for efficient 
self-assembly and encapsulation of the mRNA within the LNP, and for providing successful delivery of 
mRNA into target cells. 
The PEG-lipid (ALC-0159) is designed to largely exchange out of the LNP after administration and before 
uptake into target cells, whereas the aminolipid (ALC-0315) is critical to the efficient intracellular delivery 
of the mRNA through endosomal uptake and release and must remain with the LNP. 
ALC-0159  is  much  more  hydrophilic,  in  large  part  due  to  the  presence  of  the  PEG  molecule  which  is 
known to be a strongly hydrophilic molecule (Ma et al, 1990). Due to the more hydrophilic and essential 
neutral nature of this molecule, ALC-0159 has a much lower affinity for tissues and relative to ALC-0315 
there will be freer compound available for redistribution from tissue to plasma; thus, elimination will be 
more rapid. 
The  Applicant  pointed  out  that  during  the  course  of  the  2-week  pharmacokinetic  study,  liver 
concentrations of ALC-0315 fell  4-fold from their maximum value indicating that 75%  of the material 
delivered to the liver was eliminated over this two-week period.  
ALC-0315  has  no  known  biology.  In  the  absence  of  this  ‘biological  relevance’  the  applicant  used  an 
estimation of >95% elimination of ALC-0315 to represent the essential elimination from the body. The 
elimination half-life of ALC-0315 in the liver following IV administration in the rat is approximately 6-8 
days. These data indicate that 95% elimination of ALC-0315 will occur approx. 30-40 days following final 
administration in the rat. 
Based on the understanding of the process involved in the terminal half-life, redistribution from tissues 
into which the lipid nanoparticle is delivered, a similar half-life and time to 95% elimination in human is 
expected (Mahmood et al, 2010). Examination of the scaling of the comparable lipids (PEG2000-C-DMG, 
DLin-MC3-DMA)  in  patisiran  indicates  that  the  half-life  of  these  lipids  appears  to  scale  with  a  value 
approaching  the  typically  used  exponent  for  half-life  (0.25).  If  this  is  the  case  for  ALC-0315  we  may 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 53/140 
 
 
 
expect a half-life approximating 20-30 days in human for ALC-0315 and 4-5 months for 95% elimination 
of the lipid (Mahmood et al, 2010). 
Both  lipids  showed  an  essentially  similar  PK  profile  in  clinic  with  a  strongly  biphasic  profile  and  long 
terminal half-lives.  
Given the large difference in dose between the toxicity studies and the clinically efficacious dose (300-
1000x), it is unlikely that the administration of a booster dose will lead to significant accumulation. This 
is noted by the CHMP. 
Biodistribution: Several literature reports indicate that LNP-formulated RNAs can distribute rather non-
specifically to several organs such as spleen, heart, kidney, lung and brain. 
In line with this, results from the newly transmitted study 185350, indicate a broader biodistribution 
pattern with low and measurable radioactivity in the ovaries and testes. Given the current absence of 
toxicity in the DART data, the absence of toxicological findings in gonads in the repeat-dose studies 
and that the radioactivity in the gonads were low (below 0,1% of total dose), the current data does not 
indicate it to be a safety concern. The relative high dose used in the rats (500x margin to human dose 
based on weight) also supports a low risk from distribution to the gonads in humans. 
RNA stability and kinetics are not expected to be the same for all RNAs and are influenced by the 
nucleosides of the RNA and although expression of the full-length spike (S) protein is expected to 
follow similar kinetics of that of the luciferase with a transient expression fading over time, it cannot be 
excluded that differences in stability/persistence of the signal could differ between the luciferase 
protein and the spike (S) protein.   
In an additional hPBMC study (R-20-0357), low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IFNγ, 
IL-1β) and low or medium levels of chemokines (IP-10, MIP-1β, MCP-1) were secreted when assayed in 
an  exploratory  in  vitro  reactogenicity  assay  using  human  PBMCs  from  three  donors.  The  Applicant 
underlines that no specific general trend in cytokine secretion can be observed, given variability among 
donors and based on the low numbers of donors in the experiment.  
Toxicology 
Although no extensive pharmacological assessment has been conducted in rat (only in mouse and non-
human primate), the rat was used as a toxicological animal model in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
The positive neutralization assay results in the repeat-dose toxicity studies demonstrate that V8 and V9 
generate an immune response in this species (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies), partially supporting the use 
of the rat as an animal model. Other SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in rat remain unclear. The immune 
responses, especially at the injection sites (e.g. oedema, erythema), seem to increase with each injection 
in  the  studies  (n=3).  There  was  a  marked  increase  in  acute  phase  proteins,  fibrinogen  and  reduced 
albumin-globulin ratio (but no increase in cytokines with V8, unclear for V9). There was also a general 
increase  in  immune  cells  (LUC,  neutrophils,  eosinophils,  basophils)  and  a  decrease  in  red  blood  cell 
parameters (reticulocytes, RGB, HGB, HCT). The spleen was enlarged at both 30ug V9 and 100ug V9 
and the draining and inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged mostly at 100ug (V8) but also in a few animals 
at 30ug (V9).  
Systemic complement activation (which sometimes may be induced by liposomal drugs and biologicals 
and potentially result in hypersensitivity reactions) was not investigated as no signs indicative of such 
clinical manifestations were detected. An absence of dose-response designs in the studies increases the 
difficulty to interpret the  effects. Overall, the V8 and V9 test substances invoked a strong but mostly 
reversible  immune-linked  response  in  rats  after  17d  exposure.  Increases  in  neutrophils,  monocytes, 
eosinophils and basophils were observed in study 20GR142. For the Applicant, increases in neutrophils, 
monocytes,  eosinophils  and  basophils  observed  in  the  Study  20GR142  were  related  to  the 
Assessment report

inflammatory/immune  response  to  BNT162b2  administration.  Similar  findings  were  also  identified  in 
Study  38166  in  animals  administered  100  μg  BNT162b2.  The  applicant  stated  that  the  increases  in 
eosinophils and basophils are a minor component of the inflammatory leukogram, which is dominated 
by  increases  in  neutrophils.  The  Applicant  also  informed  that  characterisation  of  large  unstained  cells 
was not conducted since the identification of these cells would not provide additional information. The 
CHMP agreed with this position.   
With regards to the vaccine components, only the whole formulation (modified RNA in LNPs) were used, 
so  there  is  no  toxicological  data  on  the  LNP  alone  or  its  specific  novel  excipients.  The  novel  LNP 
components, these are not considered primarily as adjuvant substances.  
No genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies have been provided. The components of the vaccine 
formulation are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential.  
The novel excipient ALC-0159 contains a potential acetamide moiety. Risk assessment performed by the 
Applicant indicates that the risk of genotoxicity relating to this excipient is very low based on literature 
data  where  acetamide  genotoxicity  is  associated  with  high  doses  and  chronic  administration  (≥1000 
mg/kg/day).  Since  the  amount  of  ALC-0159  excipient  in  the  finished  product  is  low  (50  µg/dose),  its 
clearance  is  high  and  only  two  administrations  of  the  product  are  recommended  for  humans,  the 
genotoxicity risk is expected to be very low.  
As the pharmacokinetic distribution studies in rat demonstrated that a relatively large proportion - 
second to the levels at the injection site - of the total dose distributes to the liver (up to 18%, and far 
more than levels seen in spleen [<1.1%], adrenal glands [<0.1%] and ovaries [<0.1%]). While there 
was no severe pathogenesis in liver, there were some reversible functional hepatic and/or biliary 
effects with V8 and V9 (enlarged liver, vacuolation, strongly increased γGT levels at >200% and 
activity, minor-moderate increase in levels of AST and ALP) which may be linked to the LNP. The γGT 
changes were not observed with 30ug V9, which may be due to variant differences and/or, more likely, 
a lower dose. The applicant is of the view that the vacuoles are a result of primarily ALC-0315 
accumulation in liver. It can be noted that ALC-0159 needs to be lost from the surface of the LNP to 
facilitate efficient uptake into target cells. At the same time, ALC-0315 is present in the LNP at a high 
mol% (50 mol%) relative to the other lipids in the BNT162 vaccine, suggesting that this lipid is more 
likely to be present within the cells (and possibly in the vacuoles). 
The assessment of the data available as regards to the DART study shows that there is no clear 
adverse signs on fertility and early embryogenesis effects. There were no effects on the oestrous cycle 
in dams but there was an ~2x increase in pre-implantation loss (~9.77% vs 4.1% in controls) but 
these effects are within historical control data (5.1% to 11.5%) so these findings do not raise any 
specific concern. It can be noted that the choice of rat as an DART animal model is supported by 
means of the repeat-dose toxicity rat studies which demonstrates an immune response to the vaccine 
candidates [V8 and V9] and the publication of Bowman et al (2013; PUBMED ID [PMID] 24391099) 
that reports that foetal-maternal IgG ratios are relatively low during organogenesis but that these 
ratios approach 1 by the end of gestation in both rat and human. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant sufficiently addressed other concerns raised to be granted MA from a non-clinical 
perspective. 
The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

Some  rats  intramuscularly  administered  Comirnaty  (receiving  3  full  human  doses  once  weekly, 
generating relatively higher exposure in rats due to body weight differences) developed some injection 
site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) which 
is consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence 
of liver injury. All effects were reversible. These findings are described in SmPC section 5.3.   
As  per  guidance,  no  genotoxicity  nor  carcinogenicity  studies  were  performed.  The  components  of  the 
vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. This is acceptable to the CHMP.  
Finally,  the  combined  fertility  and  developmental  toxicity  study  showed  that  SARS-CoV-2  neutralising 
antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on 
postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female 
fertility, gestation, or embryo-foetal or offspring development up to weaning. The CHMP noted that no 
data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Pfizer and BioNTech have developed a vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, intended to prevent COVID-
19, for which BioNTech initiated a FIH study in April 2020 in Germany (BNT162-01) and Pfizer initiated 
a Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001) shortly afterwards in the US which expanded to include global sites 
upon initiation of the Phase 2/3 part of the study.  
Phase 1/2 Study BNT162-01 
Study BNT162-01 is the ongoing, FIH, Phase 1 dose level-finding study, in which healthy adults 18 to 
55 years of age all receive active vaccine. This study is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of 
several different candidate vaccines at various dose levels. The protocol was later amended to allow 
inclusion of older adult participants up to 85 years of age. The available Phase 1 safety and 
immunogenicity data for adults 18 to 55 years of age are reported in this application. Multiple vaccine 
candidates are being evaluated in this study. For each vaccine candidate, participants received 
escalating dose levels (N=12 per dose level) with progression to subsequent dose levels based on 
recommendation from a Sponsor Safety Review Committee (SRC). 
Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591001 
Study C4591001 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 pivotal study for 
registration. It was started as a Phase 1/2 study in adults in the US, was then amended to expand the 
study to a global Phase 2/3 study planning to enrol ~44,000 participants to accrue sufficient COVID-19 
cases to conduct a timely efficacy assessment; amended to include older adolescents 16 to 17 years of 
age, then later amended to include younger adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. In Phase 1, two age 
groups were studied separately, younger participants (18 to 55 years of age) and older participants 
(65 to 85 years of age). The study population includes male and female participants deemed healthy 
as determined by medical history, physical examination (if required), and clinical judgment of the 
investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study. Exclusions included screened individuals with high 
risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to exposure in the workplace and/or medical conditions 
that represent risk factors, clinically important prior illness or laboratory abnormalities, serological 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or current SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in the vaccine is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which 
enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The 
vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, 
which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Immunogenicity studies 
For vaccines, pharmacodynamics relates to investigation of immunogenicity. The available data were 
generated from the phase 1/2 study BNT162-01 conducted in Germany, and from the phase 1 and 2 
parts of the phase 1/2/3 study C4591001, conducted in the USA (later phases were multinational). 
Both studies were designed to choose the optimal vaccine candidate and an appropriate dose and 
schedule for further studies. Among the four prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines initially tested the 
following two candidates were selected for further development:  
BNT162b1: RNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine containing nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic 
acid (modRNA) that encodes the RBD (receptor-binding domain) 
BNT162b2: RNA-LNP vaccine containing modRNA that encodes SARS-CoV-2 full-length, P2 mutant (see 
section 2.2.2), prefusion spike glycoprotein (P2 S). 
Key features of the two studies are summarised in the below table.

Endpoints and Assays used to evaluate immunogenicity 
In Study BNT162-01, immunogenicity was evaluated in Phase 1 using a SARS-CoV-2 serum 
neutralization assay to determine neutralizing titres and the fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing 
titres. Immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) and 7 days after Dose 1 (Day 8); and at 
Day 22 (before Dose 2) and 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days after Dose 2. Only qualified assays were 
used. In addition, T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 59/140 
 
 
 
 
 
whole blood samples of vaccinated Phase 1 participants were evaluated by enzyme-linked immuno-
spot (ELISPOT) and intracellular cytokine staining visualized with fluorescence activated cell sorting 
(FACS). Blood samples were collected from study participants prior to the first vaccine dose and on 
Day 29 (7 days) after the second vaccine dose. Assessments included cytokines associated with Th1 
responses such as IFNγ and IL-2 and those associated with Th2 responses such as IL-4, to analyse the 
induction of balanced versus Th1-dominant or Th2-dominant immune responses. 
In Study C4591001, immunogenicity was evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 using a SARS-CoV-2 serum 
neutralization  assay  to  determine  titres  and  a  SARS-CoV-2  RBD-  or  S1-binding  IgG  direct  Luminex 
immunoassay to determine antibody binding levels. Fold rises were assessed also. Only qualified assays 
were used. In Phase 1, immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) and 7 days after Dose 
1; and at Day 21 (before Dose 2) and 7 days, 14 days, and 1 month after Dose 2. Data were summarized 
for each dose level and age group. In Phase 2, immunogenicity was assessed at Day 1 (before Dose 1) 
and 1 month after Dose 2. Data were summarized for each age strata group and by evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline per NAAT (PCR) or N-binding IgG assay. To facilitate interpretation of 
immunogenicity  data  generated  in  Study  C4591001,  a  human  convalescent  serum  (HCS)  panel  was 
obtained  from  Sanguine  Biosciences  (Sherman  Oaks,  CA),  MT  Group  (Van  Nuys,  CA),  and  Pfizer 
Occupational Health and Wellness (Pearl River, NY). The 38 sera in the panel were collected from SARS-
CoV-2 infected or COVID-19 diagnosed individuals 18 to 83 years of age ≥14 days after PCR-confirmed 
diagnosis  at  a  time  when  they  were  asymptomatic.  The  serum  donors  had  predominantly  had 
symptomatic  infections  (35  of  38)  including  1  who  had  been  hospitalized.  In  Phase  3,  exploratory 
immunogenicity assessments are planned at time points up to 24 months, to be reported at a later time. 
These are the immunogenicity assays that were used in clinical trials:

Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2  
The  SARS-CoV-2  Wuhan-Hu-1  isolate  spike  glycoprotein  (GenBank  accession  #  QHD43416.1)  is  the 
reference sequence for the recombinant S1 and RBD proteins used in the Luminex assays. The SARS-
CoV-2 neutralisation assay used a previously described strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). 
Study BNT162-01 
Immunogenicity - functional antibody responses (secondary objectives) 
Functional antibody titre data are available up until Day 43 for younger adults (18 to 55 yrs) dosed 
with 1, 10, 30, 50, and 60 μg BNT162b1 on Days 1 (all dose levels) and 22 (all dose levels except 60 
μg) (n=12 per group). Data are available for the 10 and 30 μg up until Day 50 for younger adults 
dosed with 1, 10, 20, and 30 μg BNT162b2 on Days 1 and 22 (dose level 1 μg, n=9; dose levels 10, 
20, and 30 μg, n=12). 
Virus neutralizing antibody GMTs for participants aged 18 to 55 years after dosing with BNT162b1, are 
shown in Figure 3. On Day 22, at 21 d after the first dose, virus neutralizing antibody GMTs had 
increased in a dose-dependent manner for all dose groups. At 7 d after the second dose (Day 29), 
neutralizing GMTs showed a strong, dose level dependent booster response. In the 60 μg dose group,

which was only dosed once, neutralizing GMTs remained at a lower level, indicating that a booster dose 
is necessary to increase functional antibody titres. 
On Day 43 (21 d after the second dose of BNT162b1), neutralizing GMTs decreased (with exception of 
the 1 μg dose level). Day 43 virus neutralizing GMTs were 0.7-fold (1 μg) to 3.6-fold (50 μg) those of a 
COVID-19 HCS panel. 
The COVID-19 HCS panel is comprised of 38 human COVID-19 HCS sera drawn from individuals aged 
18 to 83 yrs at least 14 d after confirmed diagnosis and at a time when the individuals were 
asymptomatic.

For virus neutralizing antibody GMTs for participants aged 18 to 55 yrs after dosing with BNT162b2, 
see Figure 4. Participants dosed with BNT162b2 showed a strong IMP-induced antibody response. Virus 
neutralizing GMTs were detected at 21 d after Dose 1 (Day 22) and had increased substantially in 
younger participants (aged 18 to 55 yrs) immunized with ≥3 µg BNT162b2, and older participants 
(aged 56 to 85 yrs) immunized with 20 µg BNT162b2 by 7 d after Dose 2 (Day 29). Day 29 virus 
neutralizing GMTs were comparable between the younger and older adult in the 20 µg dose level 
cohorts. The lowest tested dose of 1 µg BNT162b2 elicited only a minimal neutralizing response in 
participants aged 18 to 55 yrs.

Neutralisation of different spike protein mutants 
Different pseudoviruses including RBD sequence variants have been tested in a pseudovirus 
neutralization assay with sera from BNT162b1-and BNT162b2-immunized participants in the BNT162-
01 study. Efficient neutralization of spike protein mutants was observed with sera from BNT162b1- and 
BNT162b2-immunized participants demonstrating the neutralization breadth of vaccine-elicited 
polyclonal antibodies.

Cell mediated immunity (CMI) 
CMI were measured in terms of IFNγ- producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by ELISpot. Both vaccine 
candidates elicited clear responses (baseline vs post-dose 2). Further characterisation was determined 
using intracellular cytokine staining for Th1 cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4). Both 
vaccine candidates stimulated predominantly Th1 responses, both in CD4 and CD8 T cells.  
Study C4591001 
Methods 
The statistical analyses of immunogenicity data from Study C4591001 were based on the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations and all-available immunogenicity populations. Phase 1 and Phase 2 data 
were reported as the following, for SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers and SARS-CoV-2 S1-binding 
and RBD-binding IgG concentrations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
geometric mean titers/concentrations (GMTs/GMCs) 
geometric mean-fold rise (GMFR) 
geometric mean ratio (GMR) (for Phase 1 only) 
proportions of participants with ≥4-fold rise (for Phase 1 only) 
antibody titers/levels at defined thresholds (for Phase 2 only) 
For immunogenicity results of SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers and S1- or RBD-binding IgG 
concentrations, GMTs or GMCs were computed with associated 95% CIs. 
The GMFR was calculated by exponentiating the mean of the difference of logarithm transformed assay 
results: (later time point) – (earlier time point) with two-sided CIs. The GMR was calculated as the 
mean of the difference of logarithm transformed assay results: (SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers) 
– (SARS-CoV-2 anti-S binding antibody) for each participant, then exponentiating the mean, with two-
sided CIs. 
Results 
The study set out to evaluate 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates, as a 2-dose (separated by 21 
days) schedule, at different dose levels (BNT162b1: 10, 20, 30, and 100 μg, BNT162b2: 10, 20, and 
30 μg) and in different age groups (18 55 y; 65-85 y), to select a vaccine and dose level for further 
testing in Phase 2/3. Cut-off date: 24-Aug-2020 (1 month post-dose 2 = D52). 
Immunogenicity results are available for both adult age groups up to 1 month post-Dose 2 for the 
BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 vaccine candidates at the 10-µg, 20-µg, and 30-µg dose levels, and up to 7 
weeks after Dose 1 of BNT162b1 at the 100-µg dose level (younger age group only). 
Results for the 7 days after Dose 1 time point are only analysed and presented in the younger age 
group (18 to 55 years of age) for 10 µg and 30 µg BNT162b1.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The choice and dose of vaccine candidate was based on the results of two clinical phase I studies. 
Immune responses and safety of the two candidates were studied in both studies. The immune 
responses in terms of neutralising antibody responses clearly demonstrated that two doses resulted in 
increased geometric mean titres (GMTs) compared to responses after only the first dose. Thus, in the 
absence of a serological correlate of protection, these data supported that two doses would be needed 
in adults. The responses were numerically higher in higher dose groups compared to lower doses but 
did not substantially differ between 10ug and 30ug. The neutralising antibody responses between the 
two vaccine candidates are considered similar although no formal comparison was made. The 
responses to the vaccines were higher compared to a pool of human convalescent sera in study 
BNT162-001. In both studies subjects 55 years of age and older were included as well as younger 
adults. The responses in elderly were lower compared to younger adults, but the difference is likely of 
no clinical relevance, also considering the delayed peak. 
For BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, the S1- and RBD-binding IgG kinetics were comparable to the kinetics of 
neutralizing antibodies, with lower IgG concentrations in older age group than in younger age group. 
Further evaluation of antibody persistence is ongoing. Neutralizing antibody titres will be followed until 
the end of 162 days post-dose 2 for study BNT162-01 and up to 2-years for study C459001. Final 
study report from study C4591001 is requested to be submitted as soon as available (specific 
obligation). 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 66/140 
 
 
 
 
Immune responses induced by the vaccine against emerging circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be 
also be investigated. Effectiveness studies included in the RMP will be important to understand the 
performance of the vaccine in case of e.g. mutating variants. 
Efficient neutralization of spike protein mutants including RBD sequence variants was observed with 
sera from vaccine-immunized study BNT162-01 participants, demonstrating the neutralization breadth 
of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies. This may be important to consider when facing emerging 
variants with mutations in the spike proteins, e.g. the UK variant, as the vaccine might still be able to 
confer sufficient cross-neutralisation. 
Further characterisation of immune responses was included in study BNT162-001. Cellular immune 
responses were demonstrated in terms of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells. In addition, a clear 
Th1-polarised response, i.e. IFNγ/IL-2 ICS and limited IL-4 ICS was shown, which is reassuring in 
terms of lack of VAED. For the 30 μg dose cohort vaccinated with BNT162b2, CD4 and CD8 cytokine 
responses showed the same intensity in adults and older adults, whereas for the 30 μg dose cohort 
vaccinated with BNT162b1, RBD-specific IL-2 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were reduced in older 
adults. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The immune response data overall support the choice of vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, and the choice 
of a 2-dose schedule of 30 µg. Final study report from study C4591001 is requested to be submitted as 
soon as available (specific obligation), including data on persistence of immune responses.

Available safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data pertain to vaccine made according with the 
manufacturing process employed for clinical trial batches.  
The scale of the BNT162b2 manufacturing has been increased to support future supply. BNT162b2 
generated using the manufacturing process supporting an increased supply (commercial process) will

Severe COVID-19: incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up in participants either (1) without or 
(2) with and without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen – 
cases confirmed either (1) ≥7 days after Dose 2 or (2) ≥14 days after Dose 2. 
COVID-19 Case Definitions 
Participants who developed any potential COVID-19 symptoms were to contact the site immediately 
and, if confirmed, to participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible (within 3 days of 
symptom onset and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution). At the visit (or prior to the visit, if 
a self-swab was used), investigators were to collect clinical information and results from local 
standard-of-care tests sufficient to confirm a COVID-19 diagnosis. Investigators were to obtain a nasal 
swab (mid-turbinate) for testing at a central laboratory using a validated reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (Cepheid; FDA approved under EUA) to detect SARS-CoV-2. 
If the evaluation was conducted by telehealth, the participant was to self-collect a nasal swab and ship 
for assessment at the central laboratory. A local nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result was only 
acceptable if it met protocol specified criteria and if a central laboratory result was not available. 
Two definitions of SARS-CoV-2 related cases, and SARS-CoV-2 related severe cases, will be considered 
(for both, the onset date of the case will be the date that symptoms were first experienced by the 
participant; if new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, 
they will be considered as part of a single illness): 
Confirmed COVID-19 (defined for FDA guidance): presence of at least 1 of the following symptoms and 
SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-positive during, or within 4 days before or after, the symptomatic period, either at 
the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using an acceptable test): 
• 
Fever; 
•  New or increased cough; 
•  New or increased shortness of breath; 
•  Chills; 
•  New or increased muscle pain; 
•  New loss of taste or smell; 
•  Sore throat; 
•  Diarrhoea; 
•  Vomiting. 
The second definition, which may be updated as more is learned about COVID-19, will include the 
following additional symptoms defined by the CDC: 
• 
Fatigue; 
•  Headache; 
•  Nasal congestion or runny nose; 
•  Nausea. 
Confirmed severe COVID-19: confirmed COVID-19 and presence of at least 1 of the following: 
•  Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (RR ≥30 breaths per minute, HR 
≥125 beats per minute, SpO2 ≤93% on room air at sea level, or PaO2/FiO2<300mm Hg); 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 71/140 
 
 
 
•  Respiratory failure (defined as needing high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical 
ventilation, or ECMO); 
•  Evidence of shock (SBP <90 mm Hg, DBP <60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors); 
•  Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; 
•  Admission to an ICU; 
•  Death. 
In addition, evidence of prior infection was determined by virological testing via NAAT on mid-turbinate 
swab and serological testing for IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen. A serological definition will be used 
for participants without clinical presentation of COVID-19:  
•  Confirmed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 without confirmed COVID-19: positive N-binding 
antibody result in a participant with a prior negative N-binding antibody result. 
In addition, prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed also at Dose 2 (NAAT) and is being 
evaluated for up to 24 months. The purpose is to assess persistence of efficacy, explore efficacy 
against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, and ensure safety in both seronegative and seropositive 
participants. 
Sample size 
For Phase 2/3, with assumptions of a true VE of 60% after the second dose of investigational product, 
a total of approximately 164 first confirmed COVID-19 illness cases will provide 90% power to 
conclude true VE >30% with high probability, allowing early stopping for efficacy at the IA. This would 
be achieved with 17,600 evaluable participants per group or 21,999 vaccine recipients randomized in a 
1:1 ratio with placebo, for a total sample size of 43,998, based on the assumption of a 1.3% illness 
rate per year in the placebo group, accrual of 164 first primary-endpoint cases within 6 months, and 
20% of the participants being non-evaluable or having serological evidence of prior infection with 
SARS-CoV-2, potentially making them immune to further infection. Dependent upon the evolution of 
the pandemic, it is possible that the COVID-19 attack rate may be much higher, in which case accrual 
would be expected to be more rapid, enabling the study’s primary endpoint to be evaluated much 
sooner.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Allocation of participants to vaccine groups were performed through the use of an IRT system (IWR). 
Participants were randomised 1:1 to active vaccine or placebo.  
The trial included participants ≥12 years of age, stratified as follows: 12 to 15, 16 to 55 years or >56 
years. It was intended that a minimum of 40% of participants were to be enrolled in the >56-year 
stratum.  
The study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions 
were unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and 
participants, were blinded to study intervention assignments.  
Exceptions to blinding for e.g. DMC activities were described and found acceptable.

Efficacy Analysis Methods 
During Phase 2/3, interim analyses were pre-specified in the protocol to be conducted after accrual of 
at least 62, 92, and 120 evaluable COVID-19 cases, where overwhelming efficacy could be declared if 
the primary endpoint was met with a posterior probability that the true VE is >30% (i.e., Pr[VE 
>30%|data] >99.5% at an interim analysis or >98.6% at the final analysis). The success threshold for 
each interim analysis was calibrated to protect overall type I error at 2.5%. Futility was also assessed, 
and the study could be stopped for lack of benefit if the predicted probability of demonstrating vaccine 
efficacy at the final analysis was <5% at any of the first 2 planned interim analyses. Efficacy and 
futility boundaries were applied in a nonbinding way. The calculation of posterior probability and the 
credible interval were adjusted for surveillance time. For subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. VE is defined as 100% × (1 – IRR), 
where illness rate ratio (IRR) is calculated as the ratio of first confirmed COVID-19 illness rate in the 
vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. VE is demonstrated if there is 
convincing evidence (i.e., posterior probability greater than 99.5% at an interim analysis or greater 
than 98.6% at the final analysis) that the true VE of BNT162b2 is >30% using a beta-binomial model, 
where VE represents efficacy for prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID-19 in participants 
without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during the vaccination regimen. Participants 
with positive or unknown NAAT results at any illness visit prior to 7 days after Dose 2 were not 
included in the evaluation for VE. Cases were counted from 7 days after Dose 2.  
The interim analysis was performed for the first primary efficacy endpoint only. Other efficacy data 
analysed for the interim analysis were summarized with descriptive summary statistics, including 
COVID-19 case counts in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups on the basis of: 
• 
• 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline per NAAT or N-antigen binding assay 
subgroup status (i.e., age, sex, race, ethnicity baseline SARS-CoV-2 status) 
•  COVID-19 cases meeting protocol criteria as severe after the first and second doses. 
Overwhelming efficacy success criteria were met at the first interim analysis, so further formal interim 
analyses would not be conducted. The final analysis of all protocol specified primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints was pre-specified in the protocol to be conducted after accrual of the final number of 
COVID-19 cases (at least 164 cases). Subgroup analyses of VE were performed for the primary 
endpoints and secondary endpoint of severe COVID-19 cases. Additional post hoc analyses of 
subgroups defined by comorbidity risk assessment were performed. Secondary efficacy was analysed 
in the same manner as primary efficacy (Section 2.5.4.1.2.2), using the cases definitions for severe 
COVID-19 and CDC criteria for COVID-19 
Statistical methods 
The estimands to evaluate the efficacy objectives were based on evaluable populations for efficacy. 
These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical setting where participants follow the 
study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. In addition, VE was also analysed by all-
available efficacy population.  
The evaluable efficacy population included all eligible randomized participants who received all 
vaccination(s) as randomized, with Dose 2 received within the predefined window (19-42 days after 
Dose 1),and had no other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician on or before 7 
days after Dose 2. This was the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses. Additional 
analyses based on the all-available efficacy populations, including all randomized participants who 
completed 1 and 2 vaccination doses respectively, were also performed.

The two primary endpoints were tested hierarchically. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were 
evaluated sequentially in a prespecified order after the primary endpoints were met. Missing data were 
not imputed for the primary or secondary analyses. Sensitivity analysis of missing laboratory data was 
performed for the primary endpoint with MNAR assumption. 
VE was estimated as follows: 100 × (1 – IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed COVID-
19 illness per 1000 person-years follow-up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate 
in the placebo group from 7 days after the second dose.  
A Bayesian approach was used for the primary and secondary endpoints. A beta prior, beta (0.700102, 
1), was used for θ = (1-VE)/(2-VE). The prior was centred at θ = 0.4118 (VE=30%). The 95% interval 
for θ is (0.005, 0.964) and the corresponding prior 95% interval for VE is (-26.2, 0.995). The Bayesian 
approach was not used for the point estimate for VE. At final analysis, efficacy was to be declared if the 
posterior probability of VE greater than or equal to 30% (“p”) > 98.60%.  
During Phase 2/3, 4 interim analyses (IAs) were planned to be performed by an unblinded statistical 
team after accrual of at least 32, 62, 92, and 120 cases. The final analysis was to be performed when 
164 cases were observed. However, only one interim analysis was performed, at 94 cases. The final 
analysis was performed with 170 cases. At the time of the IAs, futility and VE with respect to the first 
primary endpoint were planned to be assessed. The IA that was performed was successful, as was the 
final analysis, and results were consistent with the IA.  
The success threshold for each interim analysis was to be calibrated to protect overall type I error at 
2.5%. The risk of falsely concluding the VE to be above 30% (the type I error rate) with the proposed 
Bayesian model and over the interim analyses and final analysis under assumption of 30% vaccine 
efficacy is 0.021 (one sided). Hence the type I error rate for the primary endpoint is controlled. 
Although only one interim analysis was performed, the overall Type I error (overall probability of 
success when true VE=30%) was controlled at 0.025 with the originally proposed success/futility 
boundaries. 
Although Bayesian analysis are not usually accepted as confirmatory evidence in pivotal trials, the 
magnitude of the effect in this study, makes this concern redundant. Hence, the conclusions of the 
inference are considered robust.

As a result, 44,822 subjects have been enrolled and 43,386 subjects have been randomised at 153 
centres, in 6 countries worldwide, including: United States (131 centres, 33,068 subjects), Argentina 
(1 site, 5,776 subjects), Brazil (2 sites, 2,900 subjects), Turkey (9 sites, 342 subjects), South Africa (4 
sites, 800 subjects) and Germany (6 sites, 500 subjects). 
Conduct of the study 
This study has gone through extensive changes or amendments. The amendments of the phase 1 of 
the study are deemed acceptable for a dose-finding design. Protocol amendments concerning the 
phase 3 of the study are overall adequately motivated and acceptable, since they are not expected to 
affect the conclusions on efficacy. Main Amendments have allowed to include adolescents from 12 to 
15 years in the study and added corresponding objectives. Furthermore, secondary efficacy endpoints 
to include COVID-19 cases that occurred from 14 days after the second dose were added. The SAP was 
amended twice in line with protocol amendments.

not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks 
before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  
Numbers analysed 
The disposition of the efficacy populations is described in the Table below. There was an imbalance 
between the two study groups on the number of subjects excluded from the evaluable efficacy 
population. The two reasons responsible for this imbalance were “Dosing/administration error, subject 
did not receive correct dose of vaccine” (n=105 in vaccines and n=3 in placebo) and “IP administered 
that was deemed not suitable for use by Almac” (n=144 in vaccines and n=0 in placebo). There may 
be several explanations for this imbalance as listed below: 
•  As the placebo was a fixed volume of saline, with no dilution required, the likelihood of a 
dosing error in the placebo group was lower compared to vaccine, which did required dilution. 
•  An isolated dosing/administrative error event in one clinical centre affecting a higher number of 
participants receiving BNT162b2 (n=52 participants) has contributed to this imbalance.  
•  Almac was responsible for determining suitability for use of investigational product that was 
subject to a temperature excursion. Due to the differences in the required storage conditions 
(ambient for the placebo versus ultracold for the BNT162b2), temperature excursions were not 
an issue for the placebo but were for BNT162b2. 
The protocol design was such that, if a participant experienced any of the specified trigger symptoms 
that could indicate COVID-19, a potential COVID-19 illness visit should occur, including obtaining a 
swab for the central laboratory.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints – Final Analysis 
The result for the first primary efficacy analysis is shown in Table 5. VE against confirmed COVID-19 
occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 95.0%, with 8 COVID-19 cases in the BNT162b2 group 
compared to 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. 
The vaccine efficacy of BNT162b2 for the same primary efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 2 all-
available efficacy population was 95.2%, with 8 and 165 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo group.

For the second primary efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID-19 was evaluated 
in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after Dose 2. 
Cases were counted from 7 days after Dose 2 (Table 6). VE against confirmed COVID-19 occurring at 
least 7 days after Dose 2 was 94.6%, with 9 and 169 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups 
respectively.  
The vaccine efficacy of BNT162b2 for the same primary efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 2 all-

However the seropositive subjects were not many: among 38,000 subjects there were 407 individuals 
seropositive in the vaccine group and 436 in the placebo group in the age strata 16-55 YOA, and 150 
individual seropositive in the vaccine group and 152 in the placebo group in the >55 YOA age strata. 
All Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 After Dose 1 
An analysis of the cases occurring from dose 1 and until dose 2 or 1 week after dose 2 provides 
information on onset of protection.  
All reports of COVID-19 with onset at any time after Dose 1 are accounted for in Table 7, which 
provides a summary of cases for all participants in the Dose 1 all-available efficacy (modified intention-
to-treat) population, regardless of evidence of infection before or during the vaccination regimen. 
Among these participants, 50 cases of COVID-19 occurred after Dose 1 in the BNT162b2 group 
compared to 275 cases in the placebo group (Table 7). Notably, in the BNT162b2 group, most cases 
occurred before Dose 2.  
Figure 9 displays cumulative incidence for the first COVID-19 occurrence after Dose 1 among all 
vaccinated participants based on Dose 1 all-available efficacy (modified intention-to-treat) population. 
Disease onset appears to track together for BNT162b2 and placebo until approximately 14 days after 
Dose 1, at which point the curves diverge, with cases steadily accumulating in the placebo group, while 
remaining virtually flat in the BNT162b2 group. From table 7 and figure 9 it is evident that the first 
dose offers partial protection, while few cases occur after the second dose.

Immunogenicity results 
The immunogenicity part of study C4591001 are presented in this section and aimed to confirm the 
conclusions on safety and immunogenicity from phase 1. These are the only immunogenicity results 
from a larger study population available at this stage, and further results from phase 3 are expected 
post approval. In addition, any data generated in attempts to establish a serological correlate of 
protection are expected to be reported when available. 
The results of the immunogenicity analyses here reported are generated from the Dose 2 evaluable 
immunogenicity population; baseline positive participants (by N-binding antibody or positive NAAT at 
Visit 1) were not excluded from these analyses. 
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titres and S1-Binding IgG Concentrations GMTs/GMCs 
At 1 month after Dose 2 (Day 52) of BNT162b2, there were substantial increases in SARS-CoV-2 50% 
neutralizing GMTs (Figure 10) and S1-binding IgG concentrations (GMCs) (Figure 11). GMTs/GMCs 
were higher in younger participants (18 to 55 years of age) than in older participants (56 to 85 years 
of age). Similar trends were observed for the SARS-CoV-2 90% neutralizing GMTs (data not shown in 
this report).

Figure 11. Geometric Mean Concentrations and 95% CI: S1-Binding IgG Level Assay – Phase 2 Dose 2 
Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
A few participants in the Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population had a positive baseline SARS-
CoV-2 status. These SARS-CoV-2 status positive participants were analysed separately from the 
baseline negative participants. In general, at 1 month after Dose 2 among BNT162b2 recipients, SARS-
CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs and S1-binding IgG GMCs in participants with a positive baseline SARS-
CoV-2 status (n=3) were numerically higher than those observed in participants with a negative 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (n=163).  
Ancillary analyses 
Vaccine Efficacy by Subgroup  
For both primary endpoints, VE was also evaluated for subgroups of participants by age, sex 
race/ethnicity, and country, without evidence of prior infection (Table 8). Results for additional age 
groups are shown in Table 9.  
Post hoc analyses of efficacy by risk status were performed. For these analyses, at-risk participants 
were defined as those who had at least one Charlson Comorbidity Index condition or who were obese 
(defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2) (table 11). Results for the all-available population were similar; no 
clinically meaningful differences were observed in VE on the basis of subgroup.  
These subgroup analyses are considered of importance. There is no evidence of significantly reduced 
efficacy in older age groups, i.e. >90% vaccine efficacy even in over 75-year-old subjects, although 
not statistically significant as there were only few cases in this age stratum. There were no cases in the 
16-17-year-old age stratum, but efficacy is not anticipated to be lower in younger age groups 
compared to the overall study population. Additionally, it is reassuring that other factors, e.g. 
ethnicity/race, gender did not impact efficacy. Efficacy was not demonstrated in subjects who were

seropositive at baseline, but the subgroup was very small and results are considered inconclusive 
rather than negative at this stage.

Vaccine efficacy for Severe COVID-19 cases, Final analysis 
Among participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen, 
the estimated VE against severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 66.4%, with 1 
and 3 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups respectively (Table 12). The posterior probability for 
the true vaccine efficacy greater than 30% is 74.29%, which did not meet the prespecified success 
criterion of >98.6% for this endpoint due to the small number of severe cases observed after Dose 2 in 
the study. 
Consequently, statistical testing of subsequent secondary endpoints (i.e., the additional secondary 
endpoints related to severe disease with pre-specified control of overall type 1 error) ended. However, 
descriptive summaries for the additional endpoints were provided.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of the selected vaccine BNT162b2 was investigated in one pivotal trial, BNT162-02 study. 
This is a phase 1/2/3, multicentre, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer blind, dose 
finding, vaccine candidate efficacy and safety study in subjects that are healthy or have clinically stable 
comorbidities. Safety and immunogenicity data generated during the phase 1 portion of this study 
supported the selection of BNT162b2 at 30 μg, as a prime/boost regimen (separated by 21 days) as 
the vaccine candidate to proceed into Phase 2/3.  
Phase 2/3 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of BNT162b2, and to provide additional safety and 
immunogenicity data in a larger population. The study design for the pivotal phase 3 study is overall 
acceptable and in line with applicable guidelines. In the Phase 2/3 portion, approximately 44,000 
participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or 
placebo separated by 21 days. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second 
vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. Participants are planned to be followed for

up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. It is an 
observer-blind study, which is considered acceptable as placebo and vaccine differed in appearance. 
Randomisation and blinding were considered acceptable.  
Overall  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  acceptable  and  the  study  population  is  considered 
representative of the target population for vaccination, including subjects at higher risk of severe disease, 
i.e. age above 65 years (>20% with no upper age limit) and relevant underlying diseases (46%, e.g. 
obesity,  chronic  pulmonary  diseases,  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  cardiovascular  disease). 
Immunocompromised  subjects  and  pregnant  or  breastfeeding  women  were  excluded  from  the  study. 
Subjects with known stable infection with HIV, HBV, HCV could be enrolled. Further, individuals who had 
previous  clinical  or  microbiological  diagnosis  of  COVID-19  were  excluded,  since  the  natural  infection 
would affect the immunogenicity of the vaccine. 
The study mainly recruited in the USA, but other sites worldwide were also included.   
The primary endpoint (laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 in participants with no serological 
or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after receipt of the second dose, and 
then in all participants regardless of serostatus) is considered relevant for the purpose of establishing 
vaccine efficacy.  
SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has been detected in nasal swab samples using Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-
CoV-2 PCR assay on the GeneXpert Molecular Diagnostic System. This method detects 2 structural genes 
of SARS-CoV-2: E and N2. A validation of this method was performed, and in addition the test was issued 
a  EUA  by  FDA.  In  order  to  assess  the  analytical  detection  limit,  live  virus  and  commercial  control 
(AccuPlexTM SARS-CoV-2) were used. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were evaluated in comparison 
with results obtained using another FDA authorised real-time RT-PCR method with positive or negative 
clinical specimens and pre-pandemic samples. Results showed that Cepheid Xpert Xpress PCR assay is 
a sensitive and specific method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs. The positive rate 
of self-swab is similar to site-swab, 3.7% and 4.7% positive from self-swab and site-swab respectively 
in the BNT162b2 group. 
The third main secondary endpoint evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe cases of the disease 
(defined as confirmed COVID-19 with the presence of at least one of pre-defined severity criteria), to 
determine whether the vaccine decreased the incidence of confirmed severe COVID-19 in participants 
with no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 to 14 days after the second 
dose. Prevention of severe disease is an important endpoint, but the relative rarity of severe cases 
would require either a very large study population and/or a very long study duration to be certain to 
achieve sufficient statistical power. Therefore, it is acceptable as a secondary endpoint.   
The immunogenicity secondary and exploratory endpoints are considered acceptable.  
This is an event-driven study. This case-driven approach is deemed appropriate as the rate of 
accumulation of cases was not certain which could allow a rapid assessment of efficacy in case of a 
high attack rate. With assumptions of a true VE of 60% after the second dose of investigational 
product, a total of approximately 164 first confirmed COVID-19 illness cases will provide 90% power to 
conclude true VE >30% with high probability, allowing early stopping for efficacy at the IA.  The 
randomisation procedure is considered appropriate to control confounding factors.  
The statistical methods are overall acceptable. The Bayesian approach used is not expected to affect 
the decisions from the hypothesis testing procedure. For consistency and ease of interpretation, the 
Clopper Pearson confidence intervals will be included in the SmPC rather than the Bayesian credible 
intervals. Of the four pre-planned interim analyses only one was performed, and the final analysis was 
also submitted. These analyses give highly consistent results with VE far from the null hypothesis limit 
Assessment report

Page 93/140 
 
 
 
of 30%. Confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity, which is considered acceptable in this 
context. 
While it could be argued that alpha could be allocated according to a group sequential design, since no 
failed interim analysis has been performed, the alpha allocated to the interim analysis may be recycled 
to the final analysis. Hence the final analysis could have been performed at full alpha level and the 
coverage probability of the “naïve” confidence interval is therefor considered correct.  
The interim and final analyses are conducted in an evaluable efficacy population of participants who 
receive the two doses within the predefined window and excluding subjects with other major protocol 
deviation, in order to obtain a best-case estimate of vaccine efficacy. However, this approach could 
result in bias due to exclusion of subjects. For this reason, sensitivity analyses assessing VE based on 
all laboratory-confirmed cases with symptom onset at any time after the first dose (dose 1 all-available 
efficacy population) and 7 days after the second dose (dose 2 all-available efficacy population) have 
been performed without excluding participants with major protocol deviations.  
Overall, the study report including the final analysis is considered adequate. This is not the final report 
for the study, as the study is expected to continue for a total of 24 months.  
Baseline data 
At the cut-off date of 14 November 2020, the disposition of the 38,000 participants were similar in the 
BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Overall, 0.2% of participants did not receive study vaccine. A small 
percentage of participants discontinued study vaccine after Dose 1 and before Dose 2 (0.6%). The 
reasons for discontinuation were also balanced. The most frequently reported reasons for 
discontinuation included: no longer meets eligibility criteria (0.3% BNT162b2; 0.4% placebo; the most 
common reason was previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19), withdrawal by 
participant, and AEs (0.1% in both treatment groups). 
The  distribution  of  demographics  and  other  baseline  characteristics  was  similar  between  both  arms 
among participants without evidence of infection up to 7 days after dose 2 in the final analysis evaluable 
efficacy  population.  Overall,  most  participants  were  White  (82.8%)  and  non-Hispanic/non-Latino 
(72.7%) (26.8% of Hispanic/latino ethnicity), median age was 52.0 years, and approximately 49% were 
female. There were 42.6% of participants in the older age group (>50 years), 26% of participants over 
65 years of age and 0.7% (112 subjects) of participants adolescents (12-17 years). In 75-85 years and 
>85 years age groups, 837 and 5 participants respectively had been vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Dose 2 
all-available efficacy). 
Across both treatment groups, 20.5% had any comorbidity (per the Charlson comorbidity index). The 
most frequently reported comorbidities were diabetes (with and without chronic complications, 8.4%) 
and  pulmonary  disease  (7.8%)  and  were  reported  at  similar  frequencies  in  each  group.  Obese 
participants made up 35.1% of the safety population. Overall, 120 subjects were HIV-positive and were 
evenly distributed between treatment groups.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36,621 participants 12 years 
of age and older (18,242 in the Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have 
evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose.  
The first interim analysis for vaccine efficacy (VE) was conducted on 08-Nov-2020 by an IDMC. The 
data cut-off date was 04-Nov-2020, when a total of 94 confirmed COVID-19 cases were accrued. There 
were 4 COVID-19 cases in the BNT162b2 group compared to 90 COVID-19 cases reported in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 94/140 
 
 
 
placebo group. These data gave a vaccine efficacy of 95.5% (95%CI: 88.8%, 97.5%) among 
participants without evidence of infection up to 7 days after Dose 2, and a >99.99% posterior 
probability for the true vaccine efficacy greater than 30% conditioning on available data. Participants 
included in the first interim analysis were also included in the final analysis.  
The date for data cut-off for the final efficacy analysis was November 14, 2020, when a total of 170 
confirmed COVID-19 cases were accrued. 
The protective efficacy in subjects without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 days after 
dose 2 was high, 95.0% (95% CI: 90.0; 97.9) in the primary efficacy population (8 cases and 162 
cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively). The posterior probability of >99.99% for the 
true VE greater than 30% met the pre-specified success criterion of >98.6% for this endpoint.  
Among participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen, 
VE  against  confirmed  COVID-19  occurring  at  least  14  days  after  dose  2  was  94.2%,  95%CI  (88.7%, 
97.2%) (8 and 139 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups respectively) with a posterior probability 
(VE≥30%/data) of >99.99%.  
Slightly more subjects in the placebo group had symptoms of COVID-19 without being a confirmed case 
by PCR. This is also reflected in slightly more subjects in the placebo arm with result not available from 
the swab. Sensitivity analysis of missing laboratory data was performed for the primary endpoint with 
the  available  data,  assuming  a  higher  than  the  observed  case  rate  when  imputing  missing  efficacy 
endpoints from participants in the BNT162b2 group only, to reflect potentially unknowable missing not 
at random (MNAR) effects that are unfavourable for efficacy results of the study. 500 imputations were 
performed that were generated using SAS PROC MI Fully Conditional Specification (FCS) method. Each 
imputation  filled  in  the  missing  laboratory  results  based  on  a  logistic  regression  model  at  the  subject 
level. VE after imputation was over 80% also with up to 15-fold increase of positivity rate applied to the 
BNT162b2 group. Hence, there is no concern that this slight imbalance has introduced any significant 
bias to the results presented below.  
The 2-dose schedule is considered justified both based on immune responses and on the actual 
efficacy results. In dose 1 all-available efficacy (mITT) population, regardless of evidence of infection 
before or during the vaccination regimen, 50 cases of COVID-19 occurred after Dose 1 in the 
BNT162b2 group (n=21,314 subjects) compared to 275 cases in the placebo group (n=21,258 
subjects). Notably, in the BNT162b2 group, most cases (36/(50)) occurred before Dose 2. The 
estimated VE against confirmed COVID-19 occurring after dose 1 was 82% (2-sided 95% CI: 75.6 %, 
86.9%), with an estimated VE of 52.4% (2-sided 95% CI: 29.5%, 68.4%) against confirmed COVID-
19 occurring after dose 1 but before dose 2.   
The cumulative incidence curves for the first COVID-19 occurrence after dose 1 (all-available efficacy 
population) showed that COVID-19 disease onset seems to occur similarly for both BNT162b2 and 
placebo groups until approximately 14 days after Dose 1, then cumulative curves diverge with more 
cases accumulating in the placebo group than in the BNT162b2 group. During the follow-up time of 
approximately 2 months post-dose 2, the BNT162b2 cumulative curve is stable which would not 
suggest waning protection. A longer follow-up is necessary to investigate the duration of the efficacy of 
the vaccine in protecting against the disease.  
For both primary endpoints, no clinically meaningful differences in VE by subgroup were observed by 
age group, country, ethnicity, sex, or race in the dose 2 evaluable efficacy population, with VE 
estimates that ranged from 91.2% to 100.0%. Efficacy was consistent across relevant subgroups.  
The results in elderly are of great importance, as increasing age is an identified risk factor for severe 
disease and death. The results from this study are therefore reassuring suggesting a high protective 
efficacy in subjects ≥65 years of age (95%, 95% CI: 66.8; 99.9). There was no indication of 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 95/140 
 
 
 
decreasing efficacy in subjects ≥75 years although the number of cases was small (0 in the vaccine 
group and 5 in placebo). In addition, the number of subjects >85YOA is very limited (5 subjects) hence 
the impact of immunosenescence on vaccine efficacy in these very old individuals remain uncertain. 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination 
regimen, VE for participants at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities 
that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, obese with body mass index (BMI) ≥30 
kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension) was 95.3%, as compared with 
94.7% for those not at risk. VE for participants ≥65 years of age and at risk was 91.7%, as compared 
with 100% for those ≥65 years of age and not at risk. VE was similar in obese (95.4%) and non-obese 
(94.8%) participants. The VE by comorbidity status are as follows: cardiovascular (VE 100.0 (-0.8, 
100.0)), Chronic pulmonary disease (93.0 (54.1, 99.8)), diabetes (94.7 (66.8, 99.9)), Hypertension 
(95.4 (82.6, 99.5)).  
Severe disease cases were uncommon in the study: 1 case in the vaccine group and 4 cases in the 
placebo group (one case in the all evaluable population) after 7 days post second vaccination. None of 
the severe cases were baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2. 
In the evaluable efficacy population, subjects without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 
estimated VE against severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after dose 2 was 66.4% (95% CI: -
124.8%: 96.3%). The posterior probability for the true VE greater than 30% is 74.29% (7 days) and 
74.32% (14 days), which did not meet the pre-specified success criterion for this endpoint, therefore 
no reliable conclusion can be drawn at this stage. While data on severe COVID-19 are limited, the 
experience with other vaccines (rotavirus and influenza vaccines with known efficacy against mild 
disease but better efficacy against severe disease) coupled with the high observed vaccine efficacy 
observed for BNT162b2 on all COVID-19 cases in populations with any comorbidity gives reassurance 
that the vaccine is likely to prevent severe disease. However, a precise estimate of its protective effect 
is presently lacking. The final study report may include additional data to the extent that the study is 
continued in a randomised fashion with a placebo group.    
The second primary endpoint -VE in participants with and without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection- yielded similar results as the one in the population excluding those without evidence of prior 
infection. However, analysis is largely driven by events in subjects without evidence of prior infection, 
and therefore does not provide additional information.  
It is not possible to conclude on vaccine efficacy in subjects with prior COVID-19, or signs of infection 
with SARS-CoV2 because only a small number of subjects were found to be seropositive at baseline 
(approximately 550 in each vaccine and placebo group), and only 2 cases of disease were reported in 
this subset (1 in each group). Further data may become available as the trial proceeds, but it is 
unlikely that the study will be able to deliver conclusive evidence for a number of reasons (e.g. it is 
very likely that the number of subjects seropositive will remain limited, and that there will be a lower 
incidence of disease in seropositive placebo recipients compared to seronegative placebo recipients due 
to existing partial protection). The extent of additional protection in seropositive subjects is presently 
uncertain. Effectiveness studies may give us some information on this regard.  
Genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in the BNT162b2 vaccine and placebo groups has not 
been performed. However, this work is planned by the Applicant. 
The primary analysis of efficacy was conducted when the pre-defined number of 164 COVID-19 cases 
had occurred. This correspond to about 1.5 months of median follow-up time duration after completion 
of the full vaccination regimen. Therefore, available efficacy data are limited in term of follow-up 
duration, and the efficacy of the vaccine over longer-time remains unknown. Data are expected to 
become available post-authorisation.

Immune responses in terms of neutralising antibodies were measured in the phase 1 and 2 part of the 
study. Overall, the immune responses measured in the phase 1 and 2 part of the pivotal study are 
consistent and in line with the phase 1 study BNT162-01 results. As expected, both neutralising 
antibody levels and S-protein binding antibody levels were higher in the youngest age stratum 
compared to the older age stratum. Serum titres in vaccinated subjects were numerically higher 
compared to human convalescent sera, up to 1 month after dose 2. There is presently no established 
correlate of protection. 
Very limited results by baseline serostatus were provided, but updated immunogenicity data is 
expected to become available.  
Cell mediated immune responses were demonstrated in the phase 1 part of the study as well as in the 
other phase 1/2 study BNT162-01, but in a small cohort of subjects only. A clear Th1-polarised 
response, i.e. IFNγ/IL-2 ICS and limited IL-4 ICS was shown, which is reassuring in terms of lack of 
VAED.  
In total 14 adolescents aged 12-15 years were included in the vaccine group and 13 in the placebo 
group, and 52 adolescents aged 16-17 years in the vaccine and 55 in the placebo group. Vaccine 
efficacy could not be estimated for these subjects as no cases of disease were reported. No immune 
response data are available. However extrapolation of efficacy is possible from young adults because, 
from an immune system perspective, adolescents do not differ from young adults, thus there are no 
reasons to believe that the vaccine will not be as efficacious at least in the age subgroup proposed for 
the current indication (>16 years).  
At cut-off date (14-Nov-2020), 120 subjects HIV positive were vaccinated with BNT162b2. 
Immunogenicity and efficacy data are not available at this time but will be provided post-authorisation. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The final clinical study report for study C4591001 will be submitted no later than December 2023 and 
is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown in subjects without evidence 
of prior SARS-Cov2 infection (VE 95.0% (95% CI: 90.3%, 97.6%), which was consistent across 
relevant subgroups. It is likely that the vaccine also protects against severe COVID-19, though these 
events were rare in the study, and statistically certain conclusion cannot be drawn. It is presently not 
known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission. The 
duration of protection is not known.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
The final clinical study report will be submitted no later than December 2023 and is subject to 
a specific obligation laid down in the MA. This will provide long-term data.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The candidate vaccine BNT162b2 at 30 µg given twice 21 days apart was assessed a first-in-human 
(FIH) study in April 2020 in Germany (BNT162-01) and a Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001) was initiated 
shortly afterwards in the United States (US). Hence, the safety data base for BNT162b2 constitutes of 
two Phase 1 studies (BNT162-01 and C4591001) and one Phase 2/3 study still ongoing (C4591001).   
The cut-off for safety data included in this assessment is 14 November 2020.  
The two Phase 1 trials (BNT162-01 and C4591001) are described in previous sections. Study 
C4591001 was initially started as a Phase 1/2 study in the USA and was then amended to expand to a 
global Phase 3 study.  
Phase 2/3 of Study C4591001 included subjects that were stratified into two age groups: 18-55 years 
and >55-85 years. The Phase 3 part however was subsequently amended (6 Sept 2020 protocol 
amendment) to include subjects from 16 years of age in the younger age group (and then from 12 
years of age) and subjects >85 years of age in the older age group.  
AEs were collected during the Phase 2/3 study from the signing of the informed consensus document 
through and including 1 month after Dose 2 (visit no. 3). In addition, in all follow-up visits where blood 
samples for immunogenicity data are taken, any AEs and SAEs as appropriate occurring up to 48 hours 
were recorded after each visit. Immunogenicity follow-up is planned to occur during that period with 
visits 1-month, 6-months, 12-months and 24-months post the first vaccination. AEs are categorized by 
frequency, maximum severity, seriousness, and relationship to study intervention using SOC and PT 
according to MedDRA. SAEs are recorded for up to 6 months after Dose 2 (ongoing at the time of this 
submission). In addition, any potential COVID-19 illness will lead to extra visits followed by 
convalescent visits. At the cut-off date 14-Nov-20, the longest follow-up time available was 12-13 
weeks after Dose 2 (N=780: N=382 BNT162b2 and N=398 placebo). 
Overall the study enrolled Phase 2/3 participants (N=43,448) that received at least one dose of 
BNT162b2 (N=21,720) or placebo (N=21,728), regardless of duration of follow-up. 
The assessment is based on the following safety data (cut-off date 14 Nov 2020): 
• 
• 
Phase 1: i) Study C4591001 (N=72 any dose of BNT162b2; N=12 BNT162b2 30µg; placebo 
N=18); ii) Study BNT162-01 (N=60 any dose of BNT162b2; N=12 BNT162b2 30µg; placebo 
N=0). 
Phase 2/3 participants with a follow-up ≥ 2 months after Dose 2 (N=19,037) of either 
BNT162b2 (N=9531) or placebo (N=9536). This subset constitutes the core safety data set in 
this assessment. 
•  All enrolled Phase 2/3 participants (N=43,448) that received at least one dose of BNT162b2 
(N=21,720) or placebo (N=21,728), regardless of duration of follow-up. In this population, the 
total number of subjects 16-17 years were 283 (N=138 BNT162b; N=145 placebo) and 100 
participants were 12 to 15 years of age (N=100; 49 in the BNT162b2 group and 51 in the 
placebo group). HIV-positive subjects (BNT162b2 N=99, placebo N=97) were included in this 
summary but not included in the analyses of the overall study objectives. 
• 
Phase 2/3 participants (N=37,706) randomised before 9 October 2020 who received BNT162b2 
(N=18,860) or placebo (N=18,846). These subjects had a median follow-up time of 2 months 
after Dose 2 (at least 1 month after dose 2). Among these, 1,148 subjects had a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 baseline status (vaccinated N=558; placebo N=590).

•  Reactogenicity was evaluated based on a subset of subjects in the Phase 2/3 study, i.e. 8,183 
(N=4,093 BNT162b2; N=4,090 placebo), who reported on local reactions, systemic events, 
and antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days after each dose by using an e-diary. Eight 
subjects aged 16-17 years were included in this subset (BNT162b2 N=5; placebo N=3). 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure  
Distribution and Exposure were presented for the population with median follow up of 2 months and for 
the whole population. Of the 37,796 subjects in the group with median follow up of 2 months who were

For Dose 1, three participants randomized to the placebo group received BNT162b2, and two 
participants randomized to the BNT162b2 group received placebo. For Dose 2, four participants 
randomized to the placebo group received BNT162b2, and five participants randomized to the 
BNT162b2 group received placebo.  
The majority of participants received Dose 2 between 19 to 23 days after Dose 1 in the BNT162b2 
(93.1%) and placebo (92.9%) groups. 
Overall, 0.3% of participants were HIV-positive and were evenly distributed between treatment 
groups. Note that HIV-positive participants were included in the safety population and are shown as 
part of the study demographics and disposition but did not have safety data available to contribute to 
the safety analyses at the time of the data cut-off. 
In total 1145 individuals of the safety population were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline. 
A high exposure rate of 99.8% to the first dose was reached in both vaccine and control arm and a 
small number of individuals were withdrawn after the first dose, leading to a high rate of exposure to 
the second dose in both study arms (98.2% and 98.1%). Reasons for withdrawals (1.0% and 1.4%, 
respectively) were in most cases withdrawals by the participant, or loss to follow-up. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety population by age group, baseline SARS-
CoV-2 status, ethnicity, race, or sex.

Table 14 Safety Population, by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status - ~38000 Subjects for Phase 2/3 
Analysis  
The disposition, exposure and withdrawal profile of the whole study population was comparable to the 
group that was randomised before 9 October 2020 with median follow up of 2 months. 
Among the 37,706 subjects with a median follow-up of 2 months, 50.6% had ≥2 months duration of 
follow-up after Dose 2 and 91.6% had a duration of follow-up time of ≥1 month after Dose 2. Around 
3000 individuals have already a follow of at least 10 weeks after dose 2. Updates, including additional 
safety data as well as assessment of the differences in safety profile in the longer follow-up compared 
to the initial safety dataset, if any, shall be provided when more mature data will be available. 
Six-months post Dose 2 follow-up data from the first ~6000 subjects are expected by the end of 
February 2021 and this will allow a relevant discussion on the safety profile versus the initial dataset. 
Based on the population with a median follow up of 2 months, demographic characteristics are 
considered well balanced between vaccine and placebo arm. Most included subjects were white (83%), 
with a median age of 52 years. A balanced distribution is seen regarding gender (51% male, 49% 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 100/140 
 
 
 
 
 
female). The younger and older age groups were 57.8% and 42.2% of participants, respectively. 
Within each age group, most demographic characteristics were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo 
groups. Of note, 35% of individuals were obese in both study arms. Across both treatment groups, 
20.7% had any comorbidity.  
The number of subjects with any Charlson co-morbidity diagnoses was balanced in both study arms 
(20%). Most prevalent were the diagnoses diabetes mellitus (7.8%) and COPD (7.8%) followed by 
subjects showing any type of malignant disease (3.9% in vaccine and 3.5% in placebo group). Other 
diagnoses were abundant with ≤ 1% in both study arms (population with a median follow up of 2 
months). In the population with a follow-up ≥2 months, Charlson co-morbidity diagnoses was similar.  
The demographic distribution was somewhat different when comparing seropositive and seronegative 
individuals, observing a median age of 43 years in seropositive and of 52 years in seronegative 
individuals. Furthermore, the seropositive group covered a higher proportion of obese individuals 
(42.2% versus 34.7%). Demographic characteristics in the whole population were comparable to those 
seen in the population with a median follow up time of 2 months. 
2.6.2.  Reactogenicity 
Reactogenicity was evaluated in a subset of the Phase 2/3 study of 8,183 subjects (BNT162b2 
n=4093; placebo n=4090) from both age groups (16 to 55 and >55 years of age) that received 
BNT162b2 or vaccine according to the proposed dosing regimen. Of note, the number of subjects aged 
16-17 years included in this subset was limited (n=8; BNT162b2 n=5; placebo n=3). After each dose, 
the subjects reported any local reactions, systemic events, including antipyretic/pain medication usage 
for 7 days, by using an e-diary (cut-off date 14 Nov 20).   
Local reactions 
The most commonly reported local reaction among the subject that received BNT162b2 was pain at the 
injection site, which occurred slightly more common among subjects 16-55 years (N=2291 [83.1%] 
post Dose 1; N=2098 [77.8%] post Dose 2) compared to those >55 years of age (N=1802 [71.1%] 
post Dose 1; N=1660 [66.1%] post Dose 2). In the placebo group, pain at the injection site after 
Doses 1 and 2 was reported at a lower frequency (16-55 [14.0% and 11.7%]; >55 [9.3% vs 7.7%]). 
There was no difference in frequency of redness and swelling at injection site after the two doses of 
BNT162b2. Redness occurred in about 5-7% in both age groups (16-55 [4.5% after Dose 1, 5.9% after 
Dose 2]; >55 [4.7% after Dose 1, 7.2% after Dose 2]). Swelling was reported also in about 5-7% of 
the subjects in both age groups (16-55 [5.8% after Dose 1, 6.3% after Dose 2]; >55 [6.5% after Dose 
1, 7.5% after Dose 2]). In the placebo group, redness and swelling were reported infrequently in both 
age groups (≤1.2%). 
Overall, the majority of local reactions were mild or moderate in severity, no Grade 4 reactions were 
reported. Severe local reactions (≤0.7%) were reported infrequently in the BNT162b2 group after 
either dose and was more commonly reported in the younger group. Across age groups, local reactions 
for the BNT162b2 group after either dose had a median onset between 1-3 days (Day 1 was the day of 
vaccination), with a median duration of 1-2 days. 
No clinically meaningful differences in local reactions were observed by baseline SARS-CoV-2 status 
subgroups. However, since the baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive subgroup included very few participants 
(vaccinated n=154; placebo n=164), these results should be interpreted with caution.

Systemic events were generally reported more frequently in the BNT162b2 group than in the placebo 
group, for both age groups and doses. Across age groups, median onset day for all systemic events 
after either dose of BNT162b2 was 2-3 days, with a median duration of 1 day. 
Systemic events were generally increased in frequency and severity in the younger age group compared 
with the older age group, with frequencies and severity increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 
2). Vomiting and diarrhoea were exceptions, with vomiting reported similarly infrequently in both age 
groups  and  diarrhoea  reported  at  similar  incidences  after  each  dose.  Systemic  events  in  the  younger 
group compared with the older group, with frequencies increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 
2), were: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and, fever.  
Following both Dose 1 and Dose 2, use of antipyretic/pain medication was slightly less frequent in the 
older age group (19.9% vs 37.7%) than in the younger age group (27.8% vs 45.0%). Of note, 
medication use increased in both age groups after Dose 2 as compared with after Dose 1. Use of 
antipyretic/pain medication was less frequent in the placebo group than in the BNT162b2 group and 
was similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2 in the younger and older placebo groups (ranging from 9.8% to 
22.0%).  
No clinically meaningful differences in systemic reactions were observed by baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status subgroups, however as mentioned data in baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects are limited. 
Overall, the reported reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from any vaccine. The local 
and systemic reactions were transient and of short duration, the majority were mild to moderate at 
intensity and the reactions were milder among older subjects (>55 years). 
2.6.3.  Adverse events  
In the subset of participants randomised before 9 October 2020 with Median 2 Months of Follow-Up After 
Dose 2 (N= 37,586; from Dose 1 to 1 month after dose 2) and the subset of participants with at least 2 
Months  of  Follow-Up  After  Dose  2  (N=19,067;  from  dose  1  to  data  cut  off  14  November  2020),  the 
numbers of overall participants who reported at least 1 AE and at least 1 related AE were higher in the 
BNT162b2 group as compared with the placebo group. This trend continued to be seen through the data 
cut-off date for all enrolled participants (N=43,252; from dose 1 to data cut-off 14 November 2020). 
Overall, AEs reported from Dose 1 to 7 days after Dose 1 and from Dose 2 to 7 days after Dose 2 were 
largely  attributable  to  reactogenicity  events  (see  above).  This  observation  provides  a  reasonable 
explanation for the greater rates of AEs observed overall in the BNT162b2 group (26.7%) compared with 
the placebo group (12.2%).  
Among all 43,448 enrolled participants included in the safety database up to the data cut-off date, few 
participants in the BNT162b2 group (0.2%) and in the placebo group (0.1%) were withdrawn because 
of AEs.

cutoff date (14 Nov 2020) – Subjects with 2 months follow-up time after dose 2 for Phase 
2/3 Analysis – Safety Population
Overall, in participants with 2 months follow up after dose 2, 21.4% / 12.6% (vaccine/placebo) and 
13.6%/3.6% experienced at least 1 AE and 1 related AE, respectively. It is noted that the frequency of 
AEs and related AEs is lower compared to individuals with a median follow up of 2 months 
(27%/12.5% and 20.8%/5.1%).  
The frequency of individuals experiencing AEs were slightly higher in the younger compared to older 
individuals (29.3% and 23.8% vaccine arm; 13.2% and 11.7% placebo arm). SAEs and deaths were 
however balanced in both study arms in both age groups. 
The frequency of immediate AEs after dose 1 was low in participants with median 2 months of follow-
up after Dose 2 (0.4%) and the whole population (≤0.5%), belonging mostly to the SOC general 
disorders and administration site conditions, primarily injection site reactions. No participant reported 
an immediate allergic reaction to vaccine.

Severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and deaths were reported by ≤1.1%, 0.6%, 0.0%, 
and 0.0%, i.e. low and equally distributed in both study arms. No differences vs. the whole population 
were seen according to age groups.  
The rate of AEs and related AEs was slightly higher in the SARS-CoV-2 negative group compared to 
SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. Stratification according to serostatus in the safety group median 
follow up 2 months reveals overall very low numbers of severe AEs, SAEs and deaths.

Month After Dose 2, by Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status - ~38000 Subjects for Phase 2/3 
Analysis – Safety Population Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status: Negative  
There were 19,067 participants with at least 2 months follow-up time after Dose 2, and similar to the 
37,586 participants randomised before 9 October 2020 with a median of 2 months of safety follow up 
after Dose 2, most AEs reported after Dose 1 up to the safety data cut-off date were reactogenicity, in 
SOCs of: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions (11.9% BNT162b2 vs 2.9% placebo) 
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5.5% BNT162b2 vs 2.1% placebo) 
•  nervous system disorders (4.2% BNT162b2 vs 2.1% placebo) 
• 
• 
infections and infestations (1.9% BNT162b2 vs 1.6% placebo) 
gastrointestinal disorders (2.6% BNT162b2 vs 1.8% placebo). 
In the younger versus older BNT162b2 age groups, AE SOCs were: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions (13.1% vs 10.4%)  
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (6.0% vs 4.9%)

infections and infestations (1.9% vs 1.9%) 
gastrointestinal disorders (2.7% vs 2.5%) 
Most often occurring events by PT comprised vaccine typical reactions such as injection site pain, 
fever, fatigue as well as myalgia and arthralgia. Lymphadenopathy occurred in 0.4% in the ≥ 2 months 
follow up subset (0% in placebo arm), or 0.3% of cases in the whole population (0% in placebo arm). 
Nausea also occurred in 0.6% more cases in the vaccine compared to placebo arm.  
Related AEs belonged overall to the same SOCs as described above, i.e. general disorders and 
administration site conditions (3426 cases, 20.8%), musculoskeletal reactions (1148 cases, 6.1%), 
and nervous system disorders (979 cases, 5.2%) and occurred overall more often in the vaccine than 
in the placebo arm (median follow up 2 months). Severe AEs occurred more often in the vaccine arm 
(1.2% vs. 0.6%) in the subset with a median follow up time of 2 months, reflecting a similar SOC 
pattern.   
The following specific observations are made based on PTs:  
Numerical disbalances are observed for several hypersensitivity terms ((drug)hypersensitivity/ 
immunisation events; 5/3 cases ≥ 2 months group, 13/6 cases whole population, 6/1 cases deemed 
related in the whole population, 4 cases deemed severe (whole population), in the SOC immune 
system disorders).  
Subjects were excluded from the Phase 2/3 study if they had a history of severe adverse reaction 
associated with a vaccine or to any component of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The protocol did not exclude 
individuals with non-severe allergic reactions to other vaccines or individuals with an allergic reaction, 
of any severity, to medication, food or environmental allergies.  
In the Phase 2/3 study, 11,673 subjects had a medical history of allergic condition (n=5839 
BNT162b2; n=5834 placebo), and, among those, two cases of allergic AEs (1 in each treatment group) 
occurred, which were deemed related to study treatment by the investigator. The participant who 
received BNT162b2 had a history of allergy to tree pollen. This participant reported Drug 
hypersensitivity and Urticaria on the day of Dose 1. Both AEs were of moderate severity and lasted one 
day. The participant did not receive Dose 2 of the vaccine. The participant who received placebo had 
an allergy to shellfish and iodine. This participant reported Allergy to vaccine and Pharyngeal swelling 1 
day after Dose 1. Both events were of moderate severity and lasted 13 days and 10 days, respectively. 
This participant did not receive Dose 2 of study intervention.  
In the ~38,000 study participants with a median of 2 months of safety follow-up after Dose 2, none 
reported an immediate AE (occurring within 30 minutes after dosing) that was indicative of an allergic 
reaction to vaccine.   
Four cases of facial paralysis were observed in the vaccine arm (facial paralysis [n=4 BNT162b2; n=0 
placebo] facial paresis [n=0 BNT162b2; n=1 placebo] in total 4/1 whole population). Time to onset 
after injection with BNT162b2 was 3, 9 and 48 days after Dose 2 and 37 days after Dose 1, which 
suggest a possible association with the vaccination. The two subjects with a time to onset of 3 and 9 
nine days had no previous history of Bell´s palsy, both subjects improved with prednisolone and the 
events were also deemed related to study intervention by the study physician.  
Numerical imbalances in AEs for appendicitis and biliary events are observed (8/4 and 14/5 cases 
(whole population)). However, none of the cases considered related to study drug treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 107/140 
 
 
 
Cases of (osteo/peri) arthritis (15/15, vaccine/placebo) and psoriasis (1/1, vaccine/placebo) have been 
observed in the vaccine arm, which where however balanced in frequency between vaccine and 
placebo arm.  
An imbalance in PT connected to sleep disturbances was noted in the whole population, which was 
driven by 25 more cases of insomnia-related events (insomnia/sleep disorder/abnormal dreams in the 
BNT162b2 group versus the placebo arm).  
A slight imbalance of hyperhidrosis/night sweats was noted in the whole population (n=26/15 
BNT162b2 group versus 8/3 in the placebo arm). Hyperhidrosis as a medical term indicates a condition 
that differs from the sweating associated with episodes of fever. The numerical relation here is not 
supported by biological plausibility. 
Injection site pruritus was reported in 31 subjects in the BNT162b2 group compared to 6 subjects in 
the placebo arm (whole population).  
Pain in the extremity was reported in 183 subjects in the BNT162b2 group and in 34 subjects in the 
placebo group (whole population).  
Stratification according to age did not reveal meaningful differences in the types of AEs. 
A stratification according to serostatus was performed in individuals with a follow up of at least one 
month (median FUP 2 months) and ≥2 months. Most abundant SOCs are similar to the SOCs identified 
in the general population with ≥2 months follow-up. No additional safety concerns are detected when 
stratifying according to serostatus.  
2.6.4.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
This section presents the SAEs reported up to the data cut-off (14-nov-20). 
Among the 19,067 subjects (BNT162b2 n=9531; placebo n= 9536) with ≥2 months of follow-up post 
Dose 2, small percentages of subjects in the 30 µg BNT162b2 group (56 [0.6%]) and the placebo 
group (53 [0.6%]) reported any SAEs. Subjects in both the BNT162b2 group and placebo group, 
respectively, reported SAEs at similar rates for the observed SOCs. A similar frequency was observed 
for the entire study population and no clinically meaningful differences in SAEs were observed by age, 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, ethnicity, race or sex subgroups. 
Among all included subjects (BNT162b2 n=21720; placebo n=21728) three SAEs were reported in the 
SOC immune system disorders. One SAE of anaphylactic reaction (related to bee sting) and one drug 
hypersensitivity (related to treatment with doxycycline) was reported in the BNT162b2 group. In 
addition, one SAE of anaphylactic shock (related to an ant bite) was reported in the placebo group. 
In the subset of individuals aged 16-17 years old, one SAE (facial bone fracture) was reported.  
After the cut-off date and up to 5-Dec-20, additional 22 SAEs have been reported (blinded data). 
SAEs related to study intervention 
Up to the cut-off date, four of the SAEs in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group were 
assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. One event of lymphadenopathy and one 
event of shoulder injury due to incorrected administration were considered related to BNT162b2.  
It is not agreed that the event of ventricular arrythmia and the event of pain in the lower 
back/extremities/and radicular paraesthesia have been convincingly demonstrated to be related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 108/140 
 
 
 
study intervention, since the subjects had underlying conditions that could have caused the two SAEs, 
there is little biological plausibility, and the overall numbers of reported events do not allow for a 
causal inference. 
Death 
Six events of death (2 in the BNT162b2 group and 4 in the placebo group) were reported in the Phase 
2/3 study up to the cut-off date of 14-Nov-20. None of the deaths were considered related to study 
intervention, which is agreed since other pre-existing diseases were more likely to have caused death 
than the vaccine. After the cut-off date and up to 5-Dec-20, one additional event of death due to aortic 
rupture were reported (data blinded). 
2.6.5.  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory results are available for the two Phase 1 studies, but not for the Phase 2/3 trials. This is 
considered acceptable. Except for minor transient decrease in lymphocyte count observed for some of 
the subjects, no abnormal lab results were reported from the Phase 1 studies. 
2.6.6.  Safety in special populations 
No clinically meaningful differences in AEs were observed by age, country (mostly Argentina, Brazil, 
USA), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, Non-Hispanic/Non-Latino), gender and race (With, Black or African 
American, all other races) subgroups. 
Pregnancy  
At the time of the data cut-off in the Phase 2/3 study (14 Nov 2020), a total of 23 participants had 
reported pregnancies in the safety database, including 9 participants who withdrew from the 
vaccination period of the study due to pregnancy. These participants are being followed for pregnancy 
outcomes. Thus, data on pregnancy are very limited at this stage.  
Elderly 
The Phase 2/3 study included >40% of subjects >55 years of age. In general, reactogenicity and AE 
rate were slightly lower in older compared to younger individuals (stratified according to median age 
55 years). No differences in AE frequency were detected among subjects >70 years of age compared 
to the older age group >55 year. Thus, no specific safety concern is anticipated for the elderly. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
Per protocol, participants with chronic stable HIV infection were defined as HIV disease with a 
documented viral load <50 copies/mL and CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 within 6 months before 
enrolment, and on stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months. Stratification by CD4 count, 
efficacy and immunogenicity data are not available at this time but will be provided post-authorisation.  
Safety data are available for 196 participants with stable HIV infection. The most frequent AEs in the 
BNT162b2 group were reported in the General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions SOC 
including injection site pain, pyrexia, chills, fatigue, injection site erythema, and injection site swelling.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Paediatric individuals age 16 to 17 years of age are included in the Phase 2/3 study that constitutes 
the safety database in this assessment. The population of subjects aged 16-17 years are limited 
(n=283). No additional or new AEs were observed compared to adults).  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 109/140 
 
 
 
There were no participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group with ≥2 months of safety follow-up at 
the time of the data cut-off (14 November 2020). The longest duration of follow-up in this age group, 
at the time of the data cut-off, was 39 days after Dose 2. The adverse event profile for this adolescent 
age group did not show meaningful differences vs. the young adult group (18 to 55 years of age) in 
the study.  
The reactogenicity subset of ~8000 participants (n=4093 BNT162b2; n=4090 placebo) contributing e-
diary data included a total of 8 participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group (including participants in 
both the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group). 
Available safety data for participants 12 to 15 years of age (N=100; n=49 BNT162b2; n= 51 placebo, 
as recruited in the Phase 2/3 study under protocol amendment 7) include reactogenicity data (local 
reactions and systemic events) collected via e-diary up to the safety cut-off date of 14 November 
2020. The reported adverse events were primarily reactogenicity events with no serious adverse 
events. The local reactogenicity profile seems comparable with the young adult population, with 
however a higher systemic reactogenicity as compared to young adults.  
In the reactogenicity subset including individuals aged 12-15 years and the 8 individuals aged 16-17 
years, the most frequently reported systemic reaction in both treatment groups were fatigue (59.2% in 
the BNT162b2 group and 25.5% in the placebo group), followed by headache (57.1% BNT162b2, 
43.1% placebo). Fever ≥38°C was reported for 26.5% more participants who received BNT162b2 over 
placebo; two (4.1%) of these participants reported severe fever (>38.9°C to 40.0°C). 
2.6.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interaction studies with other vaccines have not been performed, which is acceptable given the need to 
use the vaccine in an emergency situation. The Applicant will conduct a study post-authorisation as 
indicated in the RMP (see section 2.7). 
2.6.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Among all 43,448 enrolled participants included in the safety database up to the data cut-off date, few 
participants in the BNT162b2 group (0.2%) and in the placebo group (0.1%) were withdrawn from the 
study because of AEs. The results were similar to the AEs leading to withdrawal in the group 
randomised before 9 October 2020 with median follow up of 2 months. Among 19,067 participants with 
at least 2 months of follow-up time post Dose 2, 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group and no 
participants in the placebo group had an AE leading to withdrawal from the study. 
No participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group experienced an AE leading to withdrawal. Among all 
43,448 participants, no clinically meaningful differences in AEs leading to withdrawal were observed by 
age or other subgroups. 
2.6.9.  Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing data are not yet available as the vaccine has not been approved in any country at the 
time of the data cut-off (14-Nov-20). After the cut-off date, it is noted that several countries have 
recently authorised the vaccine for emergency use (e.g. UK, Canada, US). Two cases of anaphylactoid

reaction out of 138,000 persons vaccinated have been reported in individuals carrying Epipen after 
initiation of vaccination in one country, which resolved with standard therapy. One case of anaphylaxis 
was reported in another country (unknown denominator) in a subject without known history of 
allergies, which required ICU and was then resolved. Post-marketing safety data are expected with the 
next monthly summary safety report. 
2.6.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for BNT162b2 constitutes of two Phase 1 studies (BNT162-012 and C45910013) 
and one Phase 2/3 study (C4591001) which is still ongoing. The cut-off date for safety data included in 
this assessment is 14 November 2020.  
Up to the cut-off date ~44,000 subjects had been recruited and received at least one dose of either 
BNT162b2 (n=21,720) or placebo (n=21,728). The core safety database of this assessment constitutes 
of ~19,000 participants who have been followed ≥2 months after the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 (n=9531) 
or placebo (n=9536). The Applicant has also presented data from a subset of ~38,000 subjects 
randomised before 9 October 2020 with a median follow-up period of 2 months after Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2 (n=18,860) or placebo (n=18,846).  
Demographic characteristics are considered well balanced between vaccine and placebo arm (median 
follow up 2 months). Subjects were mostly white (83%) and had a median age of 52 years. The 
younger and older age groups included 57.8% and 42.2% of participants, respectively. Within each 
age group, most demographic characteristics were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. 
Gender was balanced (51% male). Of note, 35% of individuals were obese in study arms. The 
demographic distribution was different between seropositive and seronegative individuals, with a 
median age of 43 years in seropositive and of 52 years in seronegative subjects. Furthermore, the 
seropositive group covered a higher rate of obese individuals (42.2% versus 34.7%). Demographic 
characteristics in all participants were roughly comparable to those with median follow up of 2 months.  
Charlson co-morbidity diagnoses were balanced in both study arms (20%). Most prevalent co-
morbidities were diabetes (7.8%), COPD (7.8%) and malignant disease (3.9% in the vaccine arm and 
3.5% in the placebo arm). Other diagnoses accounted for ≤ 1% of subjects in both study arms 
(median follow up of 2 months).  
In the Phase 2/3 study reactogenicity was evaluated in a subset of 8,183 subjects who received 
BNT162b2 (n=4093) or placebo (n=4090) according to the proposed dosing regimen. The number of 
subjects aged 16-17 years included in the reactogenicity subset was small (n=8; BNT162b2 n=5; 
placebo n=3). After each dose, all subjects were asked to report any local reactions, systemic events, 
and antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days, by using an e-diary.  
Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction reported in the vaccine group, slightly 
more frequently reported among subjects 16-55 years (~80%) compared to >55 years (~70%). In the 
placebo group 8-14% reported pain at injection site. In the vaccine group redness and swelling were 
overall reported at a frequency of 5-7% in both age groups (vs. placebo 0-1%). Use of antipyretic/pain 
medication was more common after Dose 2 than after Dose 1 in both age groups, and overall slightly 
lower among subjects >55 years regardless of the dose (younger group: 28% after dose 1 vs 45% 
after dose 2; older group: 20% vs 38%). The use of antipyretic/pain medication was less common in 
the placebo group (younger group: 34% after dose 1 vs 23% after dose 2; older group: 23% vs 18%).  
2 Phase I: End of study 28 days after Dose 2. 
3 Phase I: participants enrolled in Phase1 in groups that do not proceed to Phase 2/3 (i.e. other doses than 30 µg) may be 
followed for fewer than 24 months (but no less than 6 months after the last vaccination). 
Assessment report

Among the systemic reactions, headache and fatigue were the most common events, and the 
frequency was higher after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1 (16-55 YOA [47% vs 59%]; >55 YOA [34% vs 
51%]). Fever also occurred more frequently after Dose 2 (16-55 YOA [4% vs 16%]; >55 YOA [1% vs 
11%]). None of the subjects >55 YOA in the placebo group reported events of fever and 1% of the 
subjects aged 16-55 years reported fever after the first dose.  
Overall, the local and systemic reactions were transient and of short duration (resolved within few days 
after vaccination), the majority were of mild to moderate intensity, and milder and of slightly lower 
frequency among older subjects (>55 years of age).   
In the group of 19,067 participants with 2 months follow up after dose 2, 21.4% and 12.6% (vaccine 
vs placebo) of the subjects reported at least one AE. 13.6%/3.6% reported at least 1 related AE. Rates 
were lower compared to the whole enrolled trial population (26.7% (vaccine) and 12.2% (placebo)).  
AEs in subjects with a follow up of at least 2 months belonged most often to the SOCs “General 
disorders and administration site conditions” (11.9% vs 2.9%), “musculoskeletal reactions” (5.5% vs 
2.1%), and “nervous system disorders” (4.2% vs 2.1%), occurring more often in the vaccine than in 
the placebo arm. PTs comprised most often vaccine typical reactions, i.e. injection site pain, redness 
and swelling, fever, chills, fatigue, headache as well as myalgia and arthralgia and malaise. Nausea 
also occurred more often in the vaccine arm (79 cases, i.e. 0.8%, in vaccine vs. 21 cases, i.e. 0.2%, in 
placebo). Lymphadenopathy was seen in 0.4% subjects in the vaccine arm (38 cases) vs. 0% in the 
placebo arm (3 cases), or 0.3% of cases in the whole population (0% in placebo arm). 
Severe AEs were reported by a small number of subjects (≤1.1%) and equally distributed between the 
study arms. No differences were seen between age groups. Frequencies are comparable in the whole 
enrolled trial population and when stratifying according to serostatus.  
Numerical imbalances are observed for several hypersensitivity/immunisation reaction preferred terms 
(5/3 cases in the ≥ 2 months follow up subset, 13/6 cases in the whole enrolled trial population 
subset, 4 cases deemed severe (whole enrolled trial population), in the SOC immune system 
disorders).  
Lymphadenopathy, nausea, and hypersensitivity are reported more often with the vaccine arm. For 
these items there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation to vaccination and they are as such 
included in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Subjects were excluded from the Phase 2/3 study if they had a history of severe adverse reaction 
associated with a vaccine or to any component of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The protocol did not exclude 
individuals with non-severe allergic reactions to other vaccines or individuals with an allergic reaction, 
of any severity, to medication, food or environmental allergies.  
In the Phase 2/3 study 11,673 subjects had a medical history of allergic condition (n=5839 BNT162b2; 
n=5834 placebo), and among those two cases of allergic AEs (1 in each treatment group) occurred, 
which were deemed related to study treatment by the investigator. In the ~38,000 study participants 
with a median of 2 months of safety follow-up after Dose 2, none reported an immediate AE (occurring 
within 30 minutes after dosing) that was indicative of an allergic reaction to vaccine. There are 
incoming reports of anaphylactoid reactions from ongoing vaccination campaigns. A warning is included 
in the SmPC addressing the need of adequate emergency material in place at the vaccination site, 
which is common practice with any vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended 
following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced 
anaphylaxis to the first dose.  
Four cases of peripheral facial paralysis were observed in vaccine arm (facial paralysis [n=4 
BNT162b2; n=0 placebo] facial paresis [n=0 BNT162b2; n=1 placebo] in total 4/1 whole enrolled trial 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 112/140 
 
 
 
population, however the case of paresis was not considered for this calculation). Time to onset after 
injection with BNT162b2 was 3, 9 and 48 days after Dose 2 and 37 days after Dose 1, which suggest a 
possible association with the vaccination. The two subjects with a time to onset of 3 and 9 nine days 
had no previous history of Bell´s palsy, both subjects improved with prednisolone and the events were 
also deemed related to study intervention by the study physician. Taken together, this was considered 
to indicate there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation to the vaccine, and to justify inclusion of 
peripheral facial paralysis (Bell´s palsy) in the SmPC 4.8 with a frequency as ‘rare’. 
An imbalance in PT connected to sleep disturbances was noted in the whole enrolled trial population, 
which was driven by 25 more cases of insomnia-related events (insomnia/sleep disorder/abnormal 
dreams in the BNT162b2 group versus in the placebo arm). The occurrence of insomnia may plausibly 
be due to e.g. local/systemic reactogenicity that may occur after vaccination. The CHMP agreed to 
include insomnia in section 4.8. of the SmPC.  
A slight imbalance of hyperhidrosis/night sweats was noted in the whole enrolled trial population 
(n=26/15 BNT162b2 group versus 8/3 in the placebo arm). Hyperhidrosis as a medical term indicates 
a condition that differs from the sweating associated with episodes of fever. The numerical relation 
here is not supported by biological plausibility. 
Injection site pruritus was reported in 31 subjects in the BNT162b2 group compared to 6 subjects in 
the placebo arm (whole enrolled trial population). These events may be plausibly associated to the 
injection of BNT162b2 and should therefore be included in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Pain in the extremity was reported in 183 subjects in the BNT162b2 group and in 34 subjects in the 
placebo group (whole enrolled trial population). In addition to pain at injection site, which was 
commonly reported, pain in the extremity is also considered plausibly related to the vaccination and 
should therefore be included in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Numerical imbalances in AEs for appendicitis and biliary events are observed (8/4 and 14/5 cases 
(whole enrolled trial population)), however these are considered not related to study treatment.   
Cases of (osteo/peri) arthritis (15/15, vaccine/placebo) and psoriasis (1/1, vaccine/placebo) have been 
observed in the vaccine arm. These were numerically balanced in frequency between vaccine and 
placebo arm. Autoimmune events will be monitored post-authorisation as described in the RMP. 
SAEs occurred at a low frequency in both BNT162b2 and the placebo group (0.6%, 56 cases in vaccine 
vs. 53 cases in placebo) in subjects with ≥2 months of follow-up post Dose 2, and a similar frequency 
was observed in the total study population. One SAE of lymphadenopathy and one SAE of shoulder 
injury were considered related to study intervention. No cases of related SAEs were reported in the 
adolescent group (only one case of facial bone fracture). Six events of death (2 in the BNT162b2 group 
and 4 in the placebo group) have been reported in the entire study population, all deemed unrelated to 
the vaccine.  
The rate of subjects discontinuing participation in the study due to AEs was low in both study arms 
(0.2%/0.1%).  
The subgroup of seropositive subjects is limited in size (n=545 BNT162b2; n=580 Placebo). A 
stratification according to serostatus for AE investigation was specifically performed in individuals with 
a follow up of at least one month (median Follow up 2 months) and ≥2 months. Most reported SOCs 
are similar to those identified in the ≥ 2 months population. AE rate in seropositive individuals was 
lower (22%) compared to seronegative individuals (27%) and no specific safety concern is detected in 
this subpopulation.  
23 participants reported pregnancies in the safety database, nine of them were withdrawn from the 
study due to the pregnancy status. These participants will be followed up for pregnancy outcomes.

The Applicant has not provided a specific analysis of elderly individuals > 70 years included in the 
development program. In general, reactogenicity and AE rate were slightly lower in older compared to 
younger individuals (stratified according to median age 55 years). Thus, no specific safety concern is 
anticipated for the elderly.  
Data on immunocompromised individuals are limited, which was raised as missing information in the 
RMP and will be further followed up. 196 participants with stable HIV infection were included in the trial 
and reported AEs that were mostly reactogenicity-related with no SAEs. No specific safety concern is 
detected in this subpopulation.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics as applicable. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The longest duration of follow-up in the 16-17 years of age group, at the time of the data cut-off, was 
39 days after Dose 2. The adverse event profile for this adolescent age group did not show meaningful 
differences vs. the young adult group (18 to 55 years of age) in the study, albeit is numerically lower 
(11.6%/4.8%, vaccine/placebo).  
The reactogenicity subset included a total of 8 participants in the 16 to 17 years of age group 
(including participants in both the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group). 
Available safety data for participants 12 to 15 years of age (N=100; n=49 BNT162b2; n= 51 placebo, 
as recruited in the Phase 2/3 study under protocol amendment 7) show reactogenicity events (local 
reactions and systemic events) with no serious adverse events. The local reactogenicity profile seems 
comparable with the young adult population, with however a higher systemic reactogenicity as 
compared to young adults.  
Overall, the safety of BNT162b2 in individuals 16-17 years of age is extrapolated from young adults in 
general.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The final clinical study report for study C4591001 will be submitted no later than December 2023 and 
is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the MA. 
2.6.11.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is based on one ongoing Phase 2/3 study that at the time of data cut-off (14-
Nov-20) included 43,448 subjects who received either two doses of BNT162b2 30µg (n=21 720) or 
placebo (n=21 728). Overall, the reported reactogenicity profile are in line with any authorised 
vaccine. In addition, the frequency of reported AEs and SAEs were low. The emerging safety profile is 
presently considered favourable.  Long term safety data, interaction with other vaccines, data on use 
in pregnancy and other subgroups (e.g. frail subjects, or subjects with pre-existing autoimmune 
diseases) are missing at this stage.  
The lack of long-term follow up renders the data provided non-comprehensive. Therefore, the delivery 
of the final C4951001 study report, including a 2-year follow up of the studied population, is classified 
as a specific obligation in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation. 
The plan for the generation of further safety data post authorisation is described in the section below.

2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety Specification 
Summary of safety concerns  
The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns: 
Important identified risks 
Anaphylaxis 
Important potential risks 
Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) 
Missing information 
Use during pregnancy and while breast feeding  
Use in immunocompromised patients 
Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorders) 
Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders  
Interaction with other vaccines  
Long term safety data 
Risks considered important for inclusion of the summary of safety concerns 
The review of available safety data, including post-marketing data emerging from use in the UK and 
US, the experience with biological products and other vaccines leads to the conclusion that anaphylaxis 
is an important identified risk for Comirnaty. This safety concern will be followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and in the planned and ongoing safety studies and reported in the 
monthly summary safety reports and PSURs. 
Any important potential risks that may be specific to vaccination for COVID-19 (e.g. vaccine associated 
enhanced respiratory disease) should be taken into account. The Applicant has included VAED/VAERD 
as an important potential risk and will further investigate it in the ongoing pivotal study and a post-
authorisation safety study.  
Missing information  
Since pregnant and breast-feeding women were excluded from the study, no information is available 
for those populations. It is agreed to include use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding as missing 
information in the RMP. 
At the data cut-off of 14 Nov-20, 10-14 weeks safety data are available. Thus, long-term safety is 
included as missing information and will be characterised as part of the continuation of the pivotal 
clinical trial and the PASS.  
Interaction with other vaccines, has not been evaluated in clinical trials and may be of interest to 
prescribers. As elderly individuals will be one target group for vaccination, and they often may need 
vaccination with other vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcus vaccines, further data is

requested. The Applicant commits to conduct a study of the co-administration of Comirnaty with 
inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine. 
Data from use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders), is limited, and it is desirable to 
gather further data in these groups. Therefore, use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular 
disorders) has been included as missing information in the RMP. Furthermore, information is limited on 
the use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, as well as in immunocompromised 
patients. Thus, these groups are also included as missing information. Such missing information will be 
collected in the post-authorisation safety studies. 
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the summary of safety concerns 
The reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from a vaccine, and it is considered acceptable 
to not include those events in the list of safety specifications.  
Pharmacovigilance Plan  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond the receipt and review and submission of ADRs include: 
•  A web-based AE reporting portal will be available for vaccine providers (e.g. pharmacists, 
nurses, physicians and others who administer vaccines) and recipients, to assist with anticipated 
high volume of reports (based on expectations of a large target population for vaccination). The 
portal will capture key adverse event data in the initial interaction and will provide automated 
intake into the Pfizer safety database via E2B for safety review. 
•  Signal detection activities for the lifecycle of vaccines consist of individual AE assessment at 
case receipt, regular aggregate review of cases for trends and statistically disproportionately 
reported product-adverse event pairs. Aggregated and statistical reviews of data are conducted 
utilizing Pfizer’s software interactive tools. Safety signal evaluation requires the collection, analysis 
and assessment of information to evaluate potential causal associations between an event and the 
product and includes subsequent qualitative or quantitative characterization of the relevant safety 
risk to determine appropriate continued pharmacovigilance and risk mitigation actions. Signal 
detection activities for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, will occur on a weekly basis. In addition, 
observed versus expected analyses will be conducted as appropriate as part of routine signal 
management activity. 
•  Routine signal detection activities for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine will include routine and specific 
review of AEs consistent with the AESI list provided in the RMP. 
• 
In addition, published literature will be reviewed weekly for individual case reports and broader 
signal detection purposes. 
•  Regulatory authority safety alerts monitoring, to detect and further investigate potential signals 
being raised on other areas outside of EU. 
•  A specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire intended to capture clinical details about the 
nature and severity of COVID-19 illness particularly in relation to potential cases of vaccine lack of 
effect or VAED. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 116/140 
 
 
 
• 
In addition to routine 6-monthly PSUR production, monthly summary safety reports will be 
compiled and submitted to EMA, to support timely and continuous benefit risk evaluations during 
the pandemic.  Minimum data to be submitted include: 
• 
• 
• 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, stratified by report type (medically confirmed/not) 
and by seriousness (including fatal separately); 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, overall and by age groups and in special 
populations (e.g. pregnant women); 
Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC; 
•  Summary of the designated medical events; 
•  Reports per EU country; 
•  Exposure data (including age-stratified); 
•  Changes to reference safety information in the interval, and current CCDS; 
•  Ongoing and closed signals in the interval; 
•  AESI reports – numbers and relevant cases; 
• 
Fatal reports – numbers and relevant cases; 
•  Risk/benefit considerations. 
• 
• 
The submission of monthly reports complements the submission of PSURs (requested initially every 
six months). The need and frequency of submission of the summary safety reports will be re-
evaluated based on the available evidence from post-marketing after 6 months (6 submissions). 
Joint adverse event and product complaint (including available batch/lot information) trending 
reviews will be conducted routinely by the Applicant. 
The proposed routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered appropriate for the safety profile of 
the product and the pandemic circumstances.  
Traceability 
Full traceability from manufacturing to vaccination administration site is crucial to ensure maintenance 
of the cold-chain as well as for pharmacovigilance purposes should assessment of a safety signal need 
to be performed by batch/lot. 
The Applicant’s proposal to ensure traceability include: 
•  SmPC 4.4 labelling to raise HCP awareness regarding the need to clearly record the name and 
batch of the vaccine to improve traceability; 
• 
• 
• 
a tracking device on every vaccine shipping container that provides real-time monitoring of 
GPS location and temperature 24 hours per day, 7 days per week; 
vaccine carton labelling also containing a 2-D barcode which has the batch/lot and expiry 
embedded within 
additional tools for vaccinators to record manufacturer and lot/batch information at the time of 
vaccination including a Traceability and Vaccination Reminder Card and peel-off labels (stickers 
with brand name and lot/batch numbers), acknowledging that each Member State will decided 
if and how the tools will be used, in accordance with the national provisions for 
pharmacovigilance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 117/140 
 
 
 
Each shipment to a vaccination site should be accompanied with a sufficient number of corresponding 
vaccinee traceability and vaccination reminder cards; the lot/batch numbers will be for the first batches 
distributed copied manually by the vaccinators, with the Applicant’s commitment that by 31 January 
2021 all batches shipped will be accompanied at the receipt point in the Member States by sufficient 
peel-off labels to facilitate the recording of brand name and lot/batch number both in the vaccinators’ 
records and the vaccinee traceability and vaccination reminder cards, where the Member States will 
require it. 
The Traceability and Vaccination Reminder will include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Space for name of vaccinee; 
Vaccine brand name and manufacturer name; 
Space for due date and actual date of first and second doses, and associated batch/lot 
number; 
Reminder to retain the card and bring to the appointment for the second dose of the vaccine, 
and keep it thereafter;  
QR code that links to additional information; 
Adverse event reporting information. 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The Applicant proposes the following 11 studies, of which 1 global, 3 in Europe only, 2 in Europe and 
US, and 3 in US only; the countries where 2 studies will be conducted are not available at this time. 
There are 6 interventional studies (C4591001, C4591015, BNT162-01 Cohort 13, C4591018, 1 study in 
high risk adults and 1 study addressing co-administration with another vaccine) and 5 non-

Non-Interventional Post Approval Safety Studies (4) 
The Applicant proposes 4 complementary studies of real-world safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that 
use multiple data sources and study designs.   
Study C4591010 will be conducted in the EU using primary data collection to monitor a cohort of 
vaccinees and evaluate risk of safety events of interest reflecting the AESI list.  A draft protocol 
C4591010 has been provided. 
Additionally, Pfizer, on behalf of the Applicant, will sponsor one or more PASS using secondary 
electronic health records data sources in Europe based on a master surveillance protocol developed 
through the ACCESS project. 
Two additional studies will be conducted using US data: 
o  1 study using secondary data from EHR of active military and their families (C4591011), 
o  1 study using secondary data from EHR of patients included in the Veterans Healthcare 
Administration system (C4591012). 
The draft protocols for the proposed safety studies in the US (C4591011 and C4591012) have been 
provided.  
Interventional studies (6) 
The Applicant proposes 6 interventional studies, of which 2 are ongoing and 4 are planned. 
•  Study C4591001 is an ongoing Phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, 
dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 
RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in healthy individuals. At the time of the data cut-off 
date in Study C4591001 (14 November 2020), a total of 21,720 participants received at least one 
dose of the candidate vaccine. 
•  Study BNT162-01 Cohort 13 is an ongoing multi-site (Germany), Phase I/II, 2-part, dose 
escalation trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of four prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
vaccines against COVID-19 using different dosing regimens in 30 immunocompromised adults. 
•  Study C4591015 is a planned clinical study to assess safety and immunogenicity in pregnant

•  A planned Phase II safety and immunogenicity study (Safety and immunogenicity in high risk 
adults) in up to 150 immunocompromised adults (with a range of primary immunocompromising 
conditions and/or receiving immunocompromising treatments. 
•  Co-administration study with seasonal influenza vaccine study investigating the safety and 
immunogenicity of Comirnaty and quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine when administered 
separately or concomitantly. 
Non-Interventional PASS in Pregnancy  
The Applicant’s proposed strategy to assess vaccination during pregnancy will be implemented in 
2 stages. It is anticipated that initial use in pregnancy will be very limited; therefore, initially this 
information will derive from the 4 of the real-world safety studies (C4591010, C4591011, and 
ACCESS/VAC4EU), described in the preceding section. Study C4591012 is focused on patients in the 
Veterans Health Administration system and is not expected to capture many pregnancies given the 
demographics of the source population. 
The findings from studies’ interim analysis (where planned) will inform a strategy to assess pregnancy 
outcomes as vaccination in pregnancy expands. The Applicant will consider established EU pregnancy 
research recommendations such as CONSIGN (COVID-19 infectiOn aNd medicineS In pregnancy) when 
developing any pregnancy related study objectives. The applicant’s commitment and considerations 
are noted to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in a PASS using established EU pregnancy research 
recommendations such as CONSIGN (COVID-19 infectiOn aNd medicineS In pregnancy) when 
developing any pregnancy related study objectives. Further feasibility analyses are awaited with RMP 
updates post-approval. 
Non-Interventional Post-Approval Effectiveness study (1) 
The Applicant will conduct at least one non-interventional study (test negative design) of individuals 
presenting to the hospital or emergency room with symptoms of potential COVID-19 illness in a real-
world setting (C4591014).  The effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine will be estimated against 
laboratory confirmed COVID 19 illness requiring admission to the Emergency Department (ED) or 
hospital where SARS-CoV-2 is identified.  These studies will allow to determine the effectiveness of 
Pfizer’s vaccine in a real-world setting and against severe disease, and in specific racial, ethnic, and 
age groups.  The studies proposed below are under evaluation as potential commitments; studies are 
presented by geographical area (US and EU). 
Overall conclusions on the Pharmacovigilance Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and 
characterise the risks of the product.  
Routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation 
measures. 
Plans for post-authorisation efficacy studies 
None proposed.

Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
Potential Medication Errors 
The Applicant included a discussion on potential medication errors which is endorsed: 
Large scale public health approaches for mass vaccination may represent changes to standard vaccine 
treatment process, thereby potentially introducing the risk of medication errors related to: 
reconstitution and administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, errors associated with a 
multi-dose vial, and once other COVID-19 vaccines are available, confusion with other COVID-19 
vaccines. These potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC and 
further materials for healthcare providers which will be made available to the Member States to be 
integrated in the national campaign for communication, as needed. 
•  SmPC (section 6.6) contains instructions for reconstitution and administration, vaccination scheme, 
and storage conditions of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.  
•  A poster with step-by-step instruction for vaccine storage, dose planning and preparation, and 
administration is available, which can be conspicuously displayed in settings where vaccine is to be 
administered for ongoing reference. 
•  Brochures for safe handling of the vaccine and dry ice will accompany vaccine shipments.  
•  Medical information call centres will be available for healthcare providers to obtain information on 
use of the vaccine. 
• 
• 
Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card will be provided with the pre-printed manufacturer 
name, dates of vaccination, batch/lot as a mitigation effort for potential confusion between 
vaccines. 
Peel-off labels with lot/batch number 
These available resources will inform healthcare providers on the proper preparation and 
administration of the vaccine and reduce the potential for medication errors in the context of a mass 
vaccination campaign. Additionally, the patient information leaflet and, in those MSs where applicable, 
a Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card informs patients of the vaccine received so that a series 
is completed with the same product. 
Summary of additional risk minimisation measures 
None proposed. 
The Applicant stated that Routine risk minimisation activities are sufficient to manage the safety 
concerns of the medicinal product. This is acceptable.

Summary of the risk management plan 
The public summary of the RMP is acceptable. 
Conclusion on the RMP 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. Furthermore, During the duration of the COVID-19 
pandemic situation, the MAH shall submit summary safety reports submitted to EMA, including 
spontaneously reported data and data from compassionate use and expanded access programs. The 
applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new 
EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling and serialization requirements have been granted on the basis 
of article 63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the 
context of the flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 
vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) 4 document which aims at facilitating the 
preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing 
packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-
19 vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal framework. 
Labelling exemptions 
US packaging specific derogations (valid for December ’20 and January ‘21) 
All EU Members States (MSs), as well as Norway and Iceland, have agreed to grant a temporary

exemption to allow the placing in the EU market of the US packaging, under the following conditions: 
a. The validity is only temporary and the MAH shall switch to the EU labelling requirements by 
February ’21; 
b. The US pack will have included a Quick Response (QR) code which the vaccine recipient could scan 
and gain access to the package leaflet (PL) in his/her national language;  
c. The MAH shall supply a separate printed PL in the national language(s) of those MSs that require so, 
i.e. Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France and Greece. All other MSs, that have granted a 
temporary exemption for an EN only PL, will receive 5 printed copies of the EN PL with each shipment 
of the vaccine. 
EU packaging specific derogations (from February ’21 onwards) 
a. Outer and immediate labelling will be provided in English only.  
The MAH shall provide outer and immediate labelling in all EU languages by 2nd Q 2022. This 
exemption is justified on the deep-frozen storage/shipping requirements and the necessity to label 
batches ahead of time. Production of different vaccine packs in different languages will significantly 
reduce the supply chain efficiency. The multiple changes on packaging lines will result in significant 
time and capacity losses and would slow down the rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, 
English only labelling will better help to manage a shortage situation in one country by using 
immediately the supply from another country.  
b. A printed package leaflet will be provided in the national language(s) for those MSs that require so, 
i.e. Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France and Greece. All other MSs, that have granted a 
temporary exemption for an EN only PL, will receive 5 printed copies of the EN PL with each shipment 
of the vaccine. In addition, a QR code printed on the outer label and the PL will provide access to the 
package leaflet in the national language(s). 
The MAH shall provide a printed package leaflet in all EU languages by 2nd Q 2022. 
The MAH shall engage with the National Competent Authorities (other than the 6 mentioned above) to 
discuss and speed up the provision of PLs in the respective national language(s) of the MSs concerned. 
The MAH shall also contact MSs directly to agree on the exact numbers of PLs to be distributed, again 
in line with the published Q&A on labelling flexibilities. 
c. The Blue Box will be omitted for the initial batches. The MAH shall provide the Blue Box via a QR 
code at a later stage following agreement on exact timing of implementation with the National 
Competent Authorities in each MS. 
d. The inclusion of the EU Marketing Authorisation number in the labelling will be implemented with the 
switch from US packaging to EU compliant packs in February 2021. 
Exemption from the obligation of serialisation 
US packaging specific derogations (valid for December ’20 and January ‘21) 
a. It is acceptable that the US pack will be placed in the EU market without serialisation according to 
the EU FMD requirements. Only the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) will be common for US & EU and 
this will be printed on the US pack. 
EU packaging specific derogations (from February until March ’21) 
- All EU Member States have accepted a temporary derogation from serialisation for the EU pack from 
February until the end of March 2021. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020

- The MAH shall provide two progress reports on the serialisation: a first by 1st of February ‘21 and a 
second by 1st of March ‘21 referring to details on the progress achieved in terms of ensuring 
compliance, e.g. proof of acquiring the relevant equipment, the date for the validation, the proof of 
contract to connect to the European Medicines Verification Organisation. 
- The MAH shall provide additional mitigating measures, e.g. immediate reporting of any stolen product 
during the period of exemption, reporting of any counterfeit or falsified vaccine in the EU or third 
countries in the legal supply or internet, reconciliation of product distributed and used in the respective 
territory. 
2.9.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable.

2.9.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Comirnaty (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(nucleoside-modified)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU 
and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which 
appeared in the Wuhan province in China in 2019 and has spread world-wide during 2020 ever since, 
causing WHO to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus infects primarily the airways and 
causes a broad spectrum of respiratory infections from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the 
outbreak. According to ECDC histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar 
to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis.    
As of 1 December 2020, there have been >63 million globally confirmed COVID-19 cases and >1.4 
million deaths, with 191 countries/regions affected. 
At the time of this marketing application submission, confirmed cases and mortality continue to rise 
globally. The ongoing pandemic remains a significant challenge to public health and economic stability 
worldwide.  
Comirnaty is intended for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing COVID-19. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no approved vaccine in the EU available to prevent COVID-19. Several development 
programs are ongoing globally and currently other applications are under evaluation by regulatory 
authorities worldwide. There is a very high global demand for vaccines to help contain the pandemic 
and decrease morbidity and mortality in at risk groups. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development consists of one FIH phase 1 study (BNT162-01) in younger and older adults 
(18-55 years and 56-85 years) comparing 4 vaccine candidates, and one pivotal clinical study, 
C4591001 (or BNT162-02).  
The pivotal study is a phase 1/2/3 placebo-controlled, randomised, observer-blind, dose finding, 
multicentre study performed in the US (start date 4 May 2020), Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, Germany, 
and South Africa, to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine 
candidate against COVID-19 in healthy adults. The phase 1 part of the study was designed for dose 
evaluation of 2 vaccines: BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 in younger (18-55 years) and older (65-85 years) 
adults. The Phase 2 part was designed to confirm safety and immunogenicity of the selected vaccine, 
BNT162b2, in the first 360 subjects enrolled in the Phase 2/3 part of the study.  
The Phase 2/3 part of the study was designed to enrol up to 43,998 subjects (randomised 1:1 to 
BNT162b2 or placebo) to receive BNT162b2 at the dose of 30 µg, given as 2 IM injections 21 day apart 
(within 19 to 42 days), for an efficacy assessment in addition to safety and exploratory 
immunogenicity assessments.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 130/140 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was symptomatic COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up based 
on centrally or locally confirmed nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in subjects without serological or 
virological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during vaccination regimen (cases confirmed 
≥7 days after Dose 2), and in subjects with and without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and 
during vaccination regimen. The study was event-driven, i.e. the final efficacy analysis was to be 
triggered by 162 cases; in practice 170 cases were reached.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from 7 days after 
dose 2 was 95.0% (95% CI 90.0, 97.9) in subjects ≥16 years of age without prior evidence of SARS-
CoV2 infection and 94.6% (95% CI 89.6, 97.6) in all subjects regardless of prior evidence of SARS-
CoV-2 infection (primary endpoint). This outcome met the pre-specified success criteria.  
Vaccine efficacy after dose 1 to before dose 2 was 52.4% (95% CI 29.5, 68.4). Vaccine efficacy from 10 
days after dose 1 to before dose 2 was estimated to be 86.7% (95% CI 68.6, 95). 
The  efficacy  analyses  in  the  all-available  efficacy  population  (including  participants  who  had  protocol 
violations), showed consistent results with those in the primary analysis population. The efficacy analyses 
using CDC defined symptoms to identify a COVID-19 case gave similar efficacy results as the primary 
endpoints. 
The VE in each demographic subgroup analysed, as defined by age (including subjects >65 years), sex, 
race,  ethnicity,  and  country  and  in  individuals  with  comorbidities  including  obesity,  diabetes, 
hypertension and cardiopulmonary diseases was >90%. In the obese population, VE was 95.4% (CI 95% 
86.0%, 99.1%). 
VE  among  65-74-year-olds  was  92.9%  (CI95%  53.1%,  99.8%).  VE  among  >75-year-olds  was  100% 
(CI95% -13.1%, 100.0) with 0 cases in the vaccine group and 5 cases in the placebo group. VE among 
>65 years and at risk of severe COVID-19 was 91.7% (95% 44.2%, 99.8%). 
Secondary efficacy analyses suggested benefit of the vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19, but the 
number of cases after second dose was very low, 1 case in the vaccine group and 4 cases in placebo 
group. Counting cases from after dose 1, there were 1 case in the vaccine group and 9 cases in the 
placebo group. 
Phase 1 and phase 2 immunogenicity data from both the pivotal study C4591001 and supportive study 
BNT162-01 have shown robust humoral responses after vaccination with 2 doses of BNT162b2 at 30 
μg in both younger (18-55 years) and older adults (age groups 56-85 years and 65-85 years), and 
both in terms of neutralising antibodies and IgG-antigen binding antibodies. The second dose given 21 
days post-dose 1 induced a marked boosting effect in both younger and older adults. Responses were 
generally faster and higher in younger adults than in older adults. The levels of neutralizing antibodies 
titres were moderate 21 days after dose 1. The peak of neutralizing antibodies titres was reached 14 
days post-dose 2 in older adults versus 7 days post-dose 2 in younger adults. Immune responses were 
maintained up to 1-month post-dose 2 in both age groups based on available data.  
Study BNT162-01 provides evidence for T cell-mediated immune response, with antigen-induced IFNγ 
expression demonstrating a Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ phenotype following the second dose of vaccine. For 
the 30 μg dose cohort vaccinated with BNT162b2, CD4 and CD8 cytokine responses showed the same 
intensity in adults and older adults. 
The immunogenicity results are only considered supportive at this stage, as no correlate of protection 
has been established. The immune responses support the need for two doses, as neutralising antibody 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 131/140 
 
 
 
levels increased substantially following the second dose compared to the first dose. Cell mediated 
immune responses were demonstrated in very few subjects in phase 1 but confirm a Th1 dominated 
cytokine pattern. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Based on the available limited data, no reliable conclusion on the efficacy of the vaccine against severe 
COVID-19 can be drawn from 7 days after the second dose (secondary endpoint). The estimated efficacy 
against severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after dose 2 was 66.4%, with a large and negative 
lower bound CI (95% CI: -124.8%; 96.3%).  Only a limited number of events occurred at the cut-off 
date of analysis (1 and 4 cases in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively). The posterior probability 
for  the  true  vaccine  efficacy  ≥  30%  (74.29%)  did  not  meet  the  pre-specified  success  criterion. 
Consequently, the efficacy against the severe disease across subgroups, notably certain populations at 
high-risk of severe COVID-19 cannot be estimated (elderly and subjects with comorbidities).  
Efficacy against asymptomatic infection is not available but, notwithstanding all the limitations, will be 
assessed through seroconversion of N-binding antibodies in BNT162b2 and placebo recipients who did 
not experience COVID-19. 
The pivotal study was not designed to assess the effect of the vaccine against transmission of SARS-
CoV-2 from subjects who would be infected after vaccination. The efficacy of the vaccine in preventing 
SARS-CoV-2 shedding and transmission, in particular from individuals with asymptomatic infection, can 
only be evaluated post-authorisation in epidemiological or specific clinical studies.  
Duration of protection has currently been followed up for approximately 100 days after dose 1. Data on 
longer  term  protection  are  anticipated  to  the  extent  that  the  ongoing  phase  3  study  can  continue  as 
planned with a placebo group. The assessment of efficacy over a period of at least 6 months is expected 
to determine the need and the appropriate time of a booster dose.  
There seems to be at least a partial onset of protection after the first dose, but this remains 
unconfirmed at this stage.  
There are very limited or no data in immunocompromised subjects and in pregnant women. Efficacy in 
subjects aged 16-17 years is extrapolated from young adults as no cases of disease were reported in 
this small group at this stage. 
Available data do not suffice to establish efficacy in subjects seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, 
and subjects with a known history of COVID-19. However, efficacy is anticipated in this group, to the 
extent that they are not naturally protected against re-infection, which is presently incompletely 
characterised.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in 2 clinical studies 
(BNT162-01 and C4591001) that included 21,744 participants that have received at least one dose of 
Comirnaty.  
In Study C4591001, a total of 21,720 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of 
Comirnaty and a total of 21,728 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 
and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total 
of 20,519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.  
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 132/140 
 
 
 
At the time of the analysis of Study C4591001, a total of 19,067 (9,531 Comirnaty and 9,536 placebo) 
participants 16 years of age or older were evaluated for safety for at least 2 months after the second 
dose of Comirnaty. This included a total of 10,727 (5,350 Comirnaty and 5,377 placebo) participants 
16 to 55 years of age and a total of 8,340 (4,181 Comirnaty and 4,159 placebo) participants 56 years 
and older. Reactogenicity was evaluated in a subset of 8183 subjects (n=4093 vaccinated; n=4090 
placebo) up to 7 days after each dose.  
Regarding reactogenicity, the most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and 
older were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia and chills (> 
30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%). All reactions were usually mild 
or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of 
reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The frequency of headache, fatigue and fever 
was higher after Dose 2 in both age groups. 
Regarding AEs, at least one AE was reported in 21% of the vaccinated subjects and in 13% of the 
placebo arm. The frequency of severe AEs was low (<1%) in both study arms. The most frequently 
reported SOC were “General disorders and administration site conditions (11.9% vs 2.9%)”, 
“musculoskeletal reactions” (5.5% vs 2.1%), and “nervous system disorders” (4.2% vs 2.1%). PTs 
comprised mainly of vaccine typical reactions such as injection site pain, headache, fever, fatigue, 
malaise as well as myalgia and arthralgia. 
For subjects with a follow-up of ≥2 months, SAE were reported at a low frequency (0.5-0.6%) in both 
the vaccine and the placebo group, with no clinically meaningful differences by age, baseline 
serostatus, ethnicity, race or sex. Lymphadenopathy (0.4% with vaccine vs 0.0% with placebo, or 
0.3% of cases in the whole population 0% in placebo arm) and nausea (0.8% with vaccine vs 0.2% 
with placebo) were reported to occur more often in the vaccine group compared to the placebo 
grouping the whole enrolled trial population. Numerical imbalances in reporting were observed for 
insomnia, injection site pruritus and pain in extremity. Since these are supported by a biologically 
plausible relation to vaccination, these AEs are reflected in the SmPC.  
Acute peripheral paralysis was reported in 4 vs. 0 cases (vaccine vs placebo) in the whole study 
population, of which 2 cases were deemed related to study treatment (see section 2.6.10). For acute 
peripheral paralysis, there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relation to vaccination and should 
therefore be included in the SmPC.  
In the ~38,000 study participants with a median of 2 months of safety follow-up after Dose 2, none 
reported an immediate AE (occurring within 30 minutes after dosing) that was indicative of an allergic 
reaction to vaccine. Three reports of anaphylaxis were identified during vaccination campaigns by the 
time this report was written.  
Few cases of hypersensitivity/immunisation reaction events have been observed with the vaccine (13 
vs 6 cases) in the whole study population. Hypersensitivity should be annotated in the SmPC, section 
4.8. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long term safety data is not available at this stage, however the Phase 2/3 study will follow the 
included subjects up to 2 years post vaccination, so these data are expected post-authorisation.   
AEs were slightly lower in subjects seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (22% vs. 27% in 
seronegatives), however the number of such subjects was limited (vaccinated n=558; placebo n=590).   
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 133/140 
 
 
 
Data on immunocompromised individuals is limited, as only 196 participants with stable HIV infection 
were included in the study. No specific safety concern was detected.  
Data from exposure during pregnancy is very limited. Up to the cut-off date 23 pregnancies have been 
reported in the Phase 2/3 trial and will be followed up for outcome.  
Multiple long-term pharmacoepidemiology safety studies are planned to be conducted in order to 
confirm the safety profile in the already studied population as well as in a broader population including 
pregnant, immunocompromised and very elderly subjects.  
There is no data available on interaction with other vaccines given in co-administration. 
In the Phase 2/3 study, the total number of included subjects aged 16-17 years was smaller compared 
to other age groups (n=138 BNT162b; n=145 placebo), however no safety concerns were identified.  
Uncertainties remain regarding causality association of acute peripheral paralysis to vaccination due to 
the limited number of cases, which are consistent with background rates. Nevertheless, facial paralysis 
will be included as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) for pharmacovigilance monitoring and in 
the active surveillance study protocols.  
While apart from facial paralysis, whose aetiology is currently unknown, no possible autoimmune 
adverse events where identified as causally related to vaccination, rare events of this nature cannot be 
excluded based on the size of the available data set.  
There is a theoretical risk, based on non-clinical data with MERS and SARS vaccines, of vaccine-
associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease 
(VAERD), however no cases were identified in clinical studies with COVID-19 vaccines, including 
Comirnaty, and the characterisation of the immune response does not indicate a risk profile in this 
regard (Th1 skewed). 
This vaccine contains two new components (cationic lipid ALC-0315 and PEGylated liquid ALC-0159) in 
the LNP, for which there is limited experience. Some uncertainties remain regarding the ALC-0315 long 
half-life. Regarding PEG related toxicity which is known to depend on the dose, dose frequency, 
duration of treatment and molecular weight of the PEG protein, immunogenicity is not expected to be 
an issue due to the low molecular weight of this PEG (<2KDa). The scientific data available at this 
stage do not raise noticeable concerns regarding immunogenicity or immunotoxicity of the PEG, but 
current evidence is not definitive.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, substantial efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection has been demonstrated, as 
well as an acceptable safety profile in a large phase 3 study. Uncertainties relate to the 
characterization of active substance and finished product. Given the comparable immunogenicity from 
10 to 30µg doses, an impact on efficacy of the acceptance of somewhat lower levels of intact mRNA in 
the commercial product is not considered likely. Furthermore, based on low levels and biological 
plausibility, an impact of mRNA impurities on safety is deemed unlikely (see section 3.7.3).  
Due to the limited extent of safety follow-up, the delivery of final data from the full 2-year follow up in 
the pivotal clinical trial are considered important to confirm the current knowledge.  
With regards to the balance of efficacy and safety benefits and risks, it is overwhelmingly positive for 
subjects at risk of severe COVID-19, including the elderly and those with comorbid conditions, which 
are known to increase the risk of complication and death due to infection. 
Uncertainties concerning the pharmaceutical characterization of the commercial product are compatible 
with a positive benefit/risk balance. This pertains not only to adults but, by extrapolation, to individuals 
16-17 years of age. 
Data are limited in individuals seropositive against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Available data however do 
not indicate any specific safety concerns, and efficacy is anticipated also in this subset. 
There are no data on use in pregnant women, but a protective effect is anticipated. In the light of the 
reassuring data from the DART study, noting that pregnancy as such is a risk factor for severe COVID-
19, and that pregnant women may additionally belong to other risk groups, vaccination may be 
considered on a case by case basis.  
Based on biological plausibility no risk in breastfeeding is anticipated.  
While there was no indication of an excess risk of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis in the 
clinical study program, three post marketing cases, of which 2 in patients carrying adrenaline pens and 
one in a person with no known history of allergies, have been reported during vaccination campaigns, 
and all resolved with standard treatment. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients is a contraindication. However, there is presently no substantial evidence of a negative 
benefit/risk balance in a subject with severe allergy to substances absent in the vaccine. For all 
subjects, the vaccine should be administered in settings where resuscitation facilities are available, as 
specified in the SmPC and in line with other vaccines. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given 
to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose.  
There are no efficacy data in immunocompromised individuals. Such patients may not be protected as 
well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. While there are limited safety data too in the 
immunocompromised subjects (a broad and disparate category), no particular safety issues are 
anticipated, and the benefit/risk balance of vaccination of such subjects is deemed positive, also in 
light of the underlying excess risk of COVID-19. 
Studies to monitor potential safety concerns (autoimmune disorders, VAED) are planned.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the available data are supportive of a positive B/R in the proposed indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 136/140 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Given the emergency situation, it is considered that the identified uncertainties can be addressed post-
authorisation in the context of a conditional MA, including further characterisation of the active substance 
and  finished  product,  the  continuation  of  the  pivotal  study  as  long  as  possible,  and  post-approval 
effectiveness studies and routine disease surveillance. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity was demonstrated using clinical batches of vaccine (Process 1). The 
commercial batches are produced using a different process (Process 2), and the comparability of these 
processes relies on demonstration of comparable biological, chemical and physical characteristics of the 
active substance and finished product. 
The characterisation and control of active substance and finished product are limited in relation to critical 
quality attributes and impurities.  
Data demonstrates the presence of truncated/modified forms of mRNA at somewhat higher levels in the 
batches manufactured with the commercial process as compared to material used in clinical trials. These 
forms are not sufficiently characterised, and although the limited data provided for protein expression 
does not fully address uncertainties relating to the risk of translating proteins/peptides other than the 
intended spike protein, the amount of any such proteins, is expected to be too low to elicit an immune 
response of biological relevance. 
Indeed,  considering  the  low  dose  of  mRNA  (30  µg),  the  impurities  are  not  considered  a  safety  issue 
based on general toxicological principles. However, when present in the cell it cannot be excluded that 
different proteins than the intact full-length spike will be expressed. The risk of unwanted immunological 
events is considered low based on the following observations and considerations: 
•  Such impurities were present in the vaccine used in the Phase 3 clinical trials with an acceptable 
safety profile. Although the lack of characterisation hinders a full comparability evaluation there 
is  no  indication  that  there  would  be  important  qualitative  differences  in  the  nature  of  these 
impurities. 
• 
• 
The high levels of these impurities reflect the instability of RNA resulting in generation of RNA 
fragments both in the transcription step and thereafter. Based on electrophoretic data it appears 
that there is a diverse set of fragments. Although not confirmed, it is unlikely that these RNA 
molecules to a large extent would be mRNA molecules with intact 5’-cap and 3’-polyA able to be 
translated into a specific protein or peptide.  
The level of any individual fragment of mRNA species would anyway be magnitudes lower than 
the level of the intact mRNA and this would be mirrored by the level of protein expression. The 
spike protein is a highly immunogenic protein and immunodominance would also ascertain that 
the immune response to the truncated proteins would be non-significant. 
Also, lipid related impurities were observed in recently produced finished product batches. Based on 
the low dose (30 µg mRNA) it is considered that the amounts of these impurities are too low to be of 
toxicological significance.  
Regarding the proposed control strategy for active substance and finished product, questions were 
raised both with regard to the suitability of the test methods used and the acceptance criteria for some 
tests. 
Considering the above and the current public health emergency, the characterisation of the active 
Assessment report

substance and finished product are considered acceptable, and the proposed specifications for RNA 
integrity and 5’-Cap are considered to be scientifically justified and acceptable. Nevertheless, 
additional data to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, and 
considering clinical experience, are considered important to confirm the adequacy of these 
specifications, and these data should be provided post-approval as specific obligations to the MA. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
Studies are underway to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, 
and additional clinical data from batches currently in use in ongoing clinical studies, are considered 
important to confirm the clinical qualification of these specifications. Based upon the applicant’s 
justification and commitment, detailed plans have been agreed with the applicant and reflected in the 
quality part of this assessment regarding data to be generated and submitted with interim milestones 
for assessment by the CHMP in order to complete all proposed specific obligations. Based on the 
Applicant’s plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil all quality SOs will be submitted 
gradually between March and July 2021. 
Furthermore, the applicant will continue the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind study C4591001 to obtain 2-year long-term data and to ensure sufficient follow-up in 
order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed  
There is no approved or widely available COVID-19 vaccine, and COVID-19 remains associated with 
substantial morbidity and mortality. While care for patients who have COVID-19 has improved over 
time and with clinical experience, no medications to cure COVID-19 are available and there remains an 
urgent need for a prophylactic vaccine during the ongoing pandemic. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
Convincing efficacy evidence including the elderly and those with comorbid conditions has been 
provided and long-term effectiveness and safety data will be provided post-authorisation. Taking all 
this into account, it would not be considered appropriate to withhold a highly beneficial vaccine 
considering the severity of COVID-19 disease and the current global pandemic situation, since the 
demonstrated benefits in the current emergency setting clearly outweigh the uncertainties of the 
available data as outlined above. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Comirnaty is positive.  
As available data are non-comprehensive, granting of a conditional marketing authorisation is relevant, 
and in line with provisions of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 it is supported.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty is favourable in the following indication: 
Comirnaty is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in 
individuals 16 years of age and older.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions and specific obligations: 
In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early 
supply this medicinal product is subject to a time-limited exemption allowing reliance on batch control 
testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are located in a third country. This exemption ceases to 
be valid on 31 August 2021. Implementation of EU based batch control arrangements, including the 
necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, has to be completed by 31 August 
2021 at the latest, in line with the agreed plan for this transfer of testing. Progress reports have to be 
submitted on 31 March 2021 and included in the annual renewal application.  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/707383/2020  
Page 139/140 
 
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that single-stranded, 5’-capped 
messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA 
templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

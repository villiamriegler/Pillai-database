defined as SUVVOI/SUVREF with SUV being the integrated activity over a 
given time period per unit of injected dose and body weight.  When the 
cerebellum is used as the reference region, cortical regions lacking in amyloid 
are expected to have SUVR near 1, and cortical regions rich in amyloid are 
expected to have SUVR greater than 1.  When used without qualification, 
SUVR refers to SUVR-CER (SUVR with the cerebellum as the reference 
region).  A composite SUVR is the simple average of the SUVR in multiple

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant GE Healthcare Ltd submitted on 23 November 2012 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for VIZAMYL, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 April 2011.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
VIZAMYL is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for 
the visual detection of amyloid-beta neuritic plaques in the brains of adults who are being evaluated for 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD).   
A normal VIZAMYL scan indicates sparse to no neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a 
neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the point of image acquisition: a normal scan reduces the likelihood 
that a patient’s condition is due to AD.  An abnormal VIZAMYL scan is indicative of moderate to frequent 
amyloid-beta neuritic plaques.  Neuropathological examinations have shown this amount of neuritic 
plaques is present in patients with AD, but also other types of neurologic conditions as well as in older 
people with normal cognition. VIZAMYL is to be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.  
An abnormal VIZAMYL scan does not establish a diagnosis of AD. 
The safety and efficacy of VIZAMYL have not been established for predicting the development of 
dementia or other neurological conditions, or for monitoring response to therapies.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
Flutemetamol (18F) was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/72/2011 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance flutemetamol (18F) contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a product previously authorised within the Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
It is estimated that there are over six million people with dementia in the European Union (Dementia in 
Europe Yearbook 2006) and it is predicted that this number will double in the next 20 years (Ferri et al. 
2005).  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the European Union.   
The definitive diagnosis of AD can be made only post-mortem.  The diagnosis of AD during life is based on 
a thorough clinical and neuropsychiatric examination performed by a clinician experienced in dementia.  
The  best  established  and  still  recommended  criteria  for  this  purpose  are  the  NINCDS-ADRDA  criteria 
(McKhann et al. 1984), which are handicapped for their limited sensitivity and specificity (i.e. 81% and 
70%,  respectively  (Knopman  et  al.  2001)  to  initially  diagnose  probable  AD  in  subjects  with  manifest 
dementia.   
The fact is that how AD should be best pre-mortem diagnosed, staged and followed are matters being 
actively  debated  in  the  scientific  literature  and  consensus  has  not  been  reached  yet.    Draft 
recommendations for updating diagnostic criteria for AD pre-mortem have been published from three 
independent working groups, incorporating some biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid markers and 
brain  imaging  markers,  to  the  clinical  and  neuropsychiatric  evaluation  (International  Working  Group: 
Dubois 2010, NINCDS-AA: McKhann 2011, DSM-V: Jeste 2010).   Nevertheless, neither new diagnostic

criteria nor potential biomarkers have still been validated for diagnostic purposes in the context of AD.  
CHMP  published  qualification  opinions  on  the  use  of  biomarkers  such  as  cerebrospinal  fluid  markers, 
hippocampal  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  and  β-amyloid  brain  positron  emission  tomography 
(PET) 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/892998/2011, 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/102001/2011, 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/893622/2011,  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/809208/2011).  Their  qualification  refers  solely  to 
the identification of subjects with clinical diagnosis of pre-dementia at increased risk of underlying AD 
neuropathology or to the identification of patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate AD, for the 
purposes  of  enriching  recruitment  into  clinical  trials,  aimed  at  studying  drugs  potentially  slowing  the 
progression/conversion to (severe) AD dementia of the included patients, but not for use as a diagnostic 
tool or as an outcome or longitudinal measure. 
Controversy  also  exists  on  the  validity  of  certain  diagnosis  referring  to  cognitive  impairment  in  its 
pre-dementia  stages.    First  of  all,  the  concept  of  minimal  cognitive  impairment  (as  defined  by  the 
Petersen  Criteria  2003)  or  the  prodromal  AD  (as  defined  by  Dubois  Criteria  2007)  reflects  a  different 
population.  Secondly,  it  is  not  settled  yet  if  mild  cognitive  impairment  (MCI)  as  an  episodic  memory 
impaired  group  is  an  intermediate  stage  that  a  patient  with  AD  will  pass  through  before  becoming 
demented.    Only  a  portion  of  patients  with  MCI  progresses  to  clinical  AD  dementia  over  5-10  years 
(Petersen  et  al.,  1999;  Ritchie  et  al.,  2001;  Visser  et  al.,  2006;  Mitchell  et  al.,  2009)  and  a  recent 
meta-analysis concluded that most people with MCI will not progress to dementia even after 10 years of 
follow-up (Klunk et al., 2011).  
The  idea  that  brain  β-amyloid  could  be  used  as  an  in  vivo  marker  of  AD  is  supported  by  compelling 
evidence,  since  β-amyloid  is  the  main  component  of  the  neuritic  plaques  that  are  a  key  diagnostic 
landmark in the post-mortem definitive diagnosis of the disease (Mirra et al., 1991).  However, detection 
of β-amyloid deposition in the brain does not equal AD for the following reasons: 
1.  No consensus has still been reached in the scientific community on the β-amyloid hypothesis of AD 
and the pathological process leading to AD has not been fully elucidated yet.  If β-amyloid deposition 
is demonstrated to be the cause of the disease, this characteristic could contribute to the diagnosis 
from  very  early  to  the  full  spectrum  of  clinical  AD  stages.    If  not  the  cause  but  an  effect  or 
consequence, its contribution would be restricted to specific stages of AD in which it actually appears 
or the deposition may be considered as abnormal.  
2.  Βeta-amyloid neuritic plaques are not exclusive of AD and may also be present in cognitively normal 
elderly subjects, patients with MCI, patients with other dementias (dementia of Lewy Body, Parkinson 
Disease Dementia), Niemann-Pick disease type C and severe brain injury.  
3.  The  capability  to  visualize  β-amyloid  deposition  in  brain  tissue  is  probably  not  enough  for  the 
diagnosis  of  AD.      In  fact,  pre-specified  levels  of  age-related  brain  neuritic    β-amyloid  plaque  at 
autopsy  should  be  integrated  with  the  presence  of  a  clinical  history  of  dementia  to  arrive  at  a 
diagnostic level of certainty with regard to AD (Mirra et al. 1991) 
4.  And although neuritic plaques are a common factor for the post-mortem definitive diagnosis of the 
disease, the diagnostic value for AD of different brain β-amyloid plaque types (diffuse plaques with 
pre-amyloid,  neuritic  and  cored),  as  well  as  of  different  β-amyloid  isoforms/species  (oligomeric, 
fibrillar or non-fibrillar) may well be different. 
Both the degree of β-amyloid deposition but also its neuroanatomical localization is obviously important 
for  determination  of  β-amyloid-related  pathology  in  the  brain  and  it  is  the  subject  of  continuous 
publication. Braak et al. described the characteristic pattern of deposition for different stages of typical AD 
(Braak et al. 1994).  The regional pattern of β-amyloid accumulation is different in pathologies with beta 
amyloid different than in typical AD (Edison et al. 2007). 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 10/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There might be several potential diagnostic uses, not confirmed by robust data, of in vivo detection of 
β-amyloid deposition in the brain in clinical practice worth studying. An obvious one would be excluding 
the  initial  diagnosis  of  AD  in  difficult  cases  of  dementia,  since  there  is  no  AD  without  a  particular 
age-related β-amyloid plaque score in a demented patient (Mirra et al. 1991).  The identification and 
differential diagnosis of AD are especially challenging in its early stages, partly because of the difficulty in 
distinguish it from the mild decline in memory that can occur with normal aging and from mild cognitive 
manifestations  of  other  neuropsychiatric  conditions,  such  as  depression,  as  well  as  other  causes  of 
dementia.  Other potential clinical uses in the management of AD might be as a staging criterion, marker 
of progression of the disease, and predictor of response to treatment.  It would also be of great value to 
be able to predict which patients, who upon comprehensive diagnostic testing are found to have cognitive 
impairment but are not demented and thus do not meet diagnostic criteria for AD (e.g. patients with MCI), 
are destined to progress to a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia. 
Radiopharmaceuticals have been approved by FDA and EMA, and are used in conjunction with a clinical 
evaluation, for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the 
brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of 
cognitive impairment. In their context of use it is clearly stated that a negative PET scan indicates sparse 
or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. However, a positive PET scan has important 
limitations since it does neither independently establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder nor 
allow for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to therapy.  In the context of patients with 
MCI,  the  limitations  these  radiopharmaceuticals  to  show  the  MCI  conversion  rate  to  AD  are  also 
acknowledged. 
About the product 
Flutemetamol (18F) is a small lipophilic new molecular entity designed based on the chemical structure of 
the amyloid-specific dye, Thioflavin T, and is labelled with fluorine (18F) which emits a positron signal that 
is detected by a PET scanner. As such Flutemetamol (18F) is a novel radiopharmaceutical agent which has 
been developed for imaging β-amyloid (Aβ) neuritic plaques in the human brain by PET.  Flutemetamol 
(18F) binds with high affinity and specificity to Aβ aggregates in brain tissue homogenates from patients 
with AD.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 11/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The chemical name of flutemetamol [18F] is 6-benzothiazolol, 2-[3-[18F]fluoro-4-(methylamino)phenyl] 
and has the following structure: 
Flutemetamol  [18F]  is  a  small  lipophilic  organic  chemical  molecule  containing  the  radioactive  isotope 
fluorine-18 [18F], a positron emitting radionuclide with a physical half-life of 109.8 minutes. Fluorine (18F) 
decays  to  stable  oxygen  (18O)  with  a  half-life  of  approximately  110  minutes  by  emitting  a  positron 
radiation of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiation of 511 keV. 
Due to the short physical half-life of the active substance the structure elucidation and evaluation was 
performed  on  the  non-radioactive  analogue  carrying  stable  fluorine-19.  Its  chemical  structure  was 
confirmed  by  elemental  analysis  (carbon,  hydrogen,  nitrogen  and  sulphur),  mass  spectrometry  (MS), 
UV-Vis, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopy. The equivalent structure of 
the  flutemetamol  [18F]  and  the  non-radioactive  analogue  has  been  confirmed  by  the  nature  of  the 
synthetic route used to manufacture flutemetamol [18F], and equivalent retention of the drug substance 
and the non-radioactive analogue by RP-HPLC and TLC. 
Flutemetamol has a non-chiral molecular structure. 
The fluorine-19 labelled, non-radioactive analogue of the active substance flutemetamol is a crystalline 
yellow  green  to  beige  non-hygroscopic  powder  which  is  freely  soluble  in  dimethylsulfoxide,  sparingly 
soluble in tetrahydrofuran, slightly soluble in ethanol, very slightly soluble in acetonitrile and practically 
insoluble in water. Since, the radio-labelled flutemetamol [18F] drug substance is not isolated and only 
exists in solution the crystal structure of the compound is, therefore, not relevant.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Due to the short physical half-life of 110 minutes of the radionuclide fluorine-18, the active substance, 
flutemetamol [18F], is not isolated during the manufacturing process, and it is synthesized in situ during 
the manufacture of the finished product using a non-radioactive chemical precursor (AH111907) which is 
radiolabelled using [18F]fluoride in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. 
The  chemical  precursor  is  manufactured  in  a  six-step  process  using  two  commercially  available  well 
defined  starting  materials with  acceptable  specifications.  Process  validation  data  on  three  commercial 
scale batches showing that the process is reproducible and capable of consistently producing the chemical 
precursor of the required quality have been presented. 
Active substance and finished product are manufactured in one continuous process. The manufacturing 
process of the active substance uses a typical fully automated and remote controlled synthesiser unit 
employed  to  produce  PET  radiopharmaceuticals.  The  chemical  precursor,  reagents  and  purification 
cartridges are supplied as a pre-assembled disposable cassette which is mounted onto the synthesiser. In 
this regard, the chemical precursor is distributed to the finished product manufacturer dissolved in DMSO 
in a vial. This is considered acceptable, since it has been demonstrated that it does not have a negative 
impact on the quality of the medicinal product. 
The  main  steps  for  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  active  substance  are:  proton  irradiation 
of 18O-enriched water to obtain fluoride-18, separation of the fluoride-18 from the target water followed 
by  a  nucleophilic  substitution  of  the  organic  chemical  precursor  AH111907,  chemical  modification  of 
unreacted precursor to achieve later better separation performance during the chromatographic cartridge

on stability is provided in the finished product section. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a stable formulation for immediate intravenous 
injection of [18F] flutemetamol.  
Throughout  the  development  of  flutemetamol  [18F]  injection,  different  formulations  were  used  for 
non-clinical and clinical studies. This, in early clinical trials [11C] flutemetamol was used. However, since 
[11C] has a half-life of 20.4 minutes which makes it unsuitable for routine manufacture, [18F] with a longer 
half-life 109.8 minutes was devised and used for subsequent clinical trials.  
The sterility of the finished product is assured by aseptic manufacture followed by sterile filtration rather 
than terminal sterilisation by autoclaving. This has been justified based on the instability of polysorbate 
80 upon exposure to heat, and the fast radioactive decay of fluorine-18, and is considered acceptable. The 
aseptic dispensing process has been validated at the manufacturing sites. 
The finished product contains simple and safe European pharmacopoeial excipients commonly used in 
solutions  for  injections:  ethanol,  polysorbate  80,  sodium  chloride,  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate 
dihydrate,  disodium  hydrogen  phosphate  dodecahydrate  and  water  for  injection.  Ethanol  is  used  as 
solubiliser  and  stabiliser,  polysorbate  80  as  solubiliser,  sodium  chloride  as  isotonic  agent,  and  the 
phosphate buffer maintains the pH of the formulation to suitable levels. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
Compatibility  studies  of  flutemetamol  [18F]  with  physiological  saline  and  water  for  injections  (WFI) 
showed that the dilution of the drug product with physiological saline or WFI should be avoided because 
such  dilution  might  decrease  the  solubility  of  the  active  substance  leading  to  precipitation  and/or 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 13/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adsorption of the active substance to surfaces.  However, physiological saline and WFI are compatible 
when  used  to  rinse  or  flush  the  administration  equipment  (infusion  set  and  dosing  syringe)  after 
administration of flutemetamol [18F] solution for injection. 
The primary packaging are  type I glass vials with halobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium seals. The 
material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
As mentioned above, the active substance and the finished product are manufactured in one automated 
continuous  process  which  does  not  allow  the  isolation  of  the  active  substance.  Therefore,  the 
manufacturers of the finished product are the same proposed for the manufacture of the active substance. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product consists of four steps: addition of the excipients and 
mixing, dilution of the bulk solution, sterile filtration and aseptic dispensing into vials.  
One  of  the  dispenser  modules  proposed  by  the  applicant  leads  to  finished  product  filled  in  vials  with 
punctured rubber septum. This is due to the fact that this dispenser fills empty product vials which are 
already closed with rubber stoppers. The applicant has stated that the vial septa reseals, and in addition 
has proposed to apply a pre-sterilised cap to each of those vials. This approach has been accepted due to 
the fact that the vial content will be used within one day. However, the CHMP recommends revising the 
operation of this dispensing unit so that only vials with non-punctured rubber septa are produced, since 
this is the usual standard for the delivery of sterile solutions. 
The process is considered to be a non- standard manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing 
process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of products 
and include: appearance, radiochemical identity (HPLC), radionuclidic identity (half-life determination), 
assay (radioactive concentration), ethanol content (GC), chemical purity (HPLC-UV), residual solvents 
(GC),  pH,  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.  Eur.),  radiochemical  purity  (HPLC  with 
radioactivity detector), radionuclidic purity (gamma-ray spectrometry).  
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  representative  batches  from  each  of  the  four  proposed 
manufacturing  sites  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing, although sterility test and the radionuclidic purity test for long 
living radionuclides are conducted after batch release (as usual for this type of products). 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of Vizamyl solution for injection manufactured at each of 
the four proposed manufacturing sites and stored at 5°C ± 3°C and 50°C ± 2°C with ambient humidity, 
covering a storage period of 10 hours, have been provided. The batches of Vizamyl are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. A matrixing 
approach covering the different container closure systems proposed for commercial supply, minimum and 
maximum  fill  volumes,  and  storage  conditions  of  5°C  ±  3°C  and  50°C  ±  2°C  has  been  followed.  
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 14/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally,  supportive  stability  data  on  36  undiluted  batches  of  Vizamyl  solution  for  injection 
manufactured at another site and stored at 5°C ± 3°C and 50°C ± 2°C have been presented. All batches 
were tested at end of synthesis and approximately 10 hours post-synthesis. 
Although  these  storage  conditions  deviate  from  the standard  temperatures  stated in  the  ICH  stability 
guidelines, they have been justified based on the fact that they would represent the worst case scenario 
to monitor the product performance during handling and transport from the manufacturing site to the 
final  user,  according  to  the  experience  gained  during  the  clinical  phase.  Furthermore,  the  applicant 
presented  additional  stability  data  on  three  complementary  batches  manufactured  by  each  of  the 
proposed manufacturing sites intended for commercial supply stored in the temperature range of 20°C to 
25°C. 
Samples were tested for appearance, radioactive concentration (RAC) at end of synthesis, total content of 
flutemetamol and related substances radiochemical purity, and [18F]fluoride. The analytical procedures 
used were stability indicating.Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant is recommended to revise the operation of the dispensing unit which leads to punctured 
rubber septa. The use of dispensing units leading to non-punctured rubber septa is the usual standard for 
the delivery of sterile solutions.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Amyloid is an abnormal deposit of insoluble protein fibrils in a body tissue or organ.  It is characterized by 
unique  staining  properties,  electron  microscopic  appearance,  and  a  β-pleated  sheet  pattern  on  X-ray 
diffraction analysis.  Amyloid can be formed from many proteins, and it can accumulate in tissue to form 
visible plaques.  It is associated with over 30 human diseases, most notably Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
The specific type of amyloid involved in AD is amyloid-β or Aβ which is the main component of neuritic 
plaques,  one  of  the  two  hallmarks  of  AD  that  can  be  seen  microscopically  in  brain  tissue  specimens 
stained with certain dyes, the other being neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein.   
Thioflavin T is one of the histologic dyes used to detect amyloid ex vivo, producing a fluorescent signal 
that marks the characteristic pattern of amyloid plaques post mortem. However, since Thioflavin T does 
not penetrate the blood brain barrier, it could not be developed as an agent for in vivo imaging in the 
brain. Some compounds derived from Thioflavin T have been developed and are designed to be neutral 
and uncharged molecules to allow them to cross the blood brain barrier. Flutemetamol and Pittsburgh 
Compound B (PiB) are very similar in chemical structure, differing only by the presence of a fluorine atom 
in flutemetamol. Clinical data show that they have similar uptake into the human brain and their PET 
images are similar in their visualization of brain amyloid.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro affinity assays: demonstration of flutemetamol binding to human β-amyloid protein (B067051, 
non GLP) 
This research study was designed to test the affinity of flutemetamol towards synthetic fibrillar amyloid 
β 1-40 (β-amyloid 1-40 fibrils) in vitro. Although the specific binding site of flutemetamol has not been 
identified, this study shows that it is associated with the β sheet folds of fibrillar amyloid β. 
An in vitro human brain homogenate assay was performed which indicated selectivity for fibrillar amyloid 
β  in  the  presence  of  normal  brain  tissue  homogenate.  Less  non-specific  binding  in  the  white  matter 
compared with grey matter was detected. 
In vitro human brain autoradiography (B067050, non GLP) 
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  uptake  of  [3H]flutemetamol  into  senile  plaques  obtained 
post-mortem  from  human  brain  from  Alzheimer’s  disease  cases.  Two  different  control  groups  were 
provided by the inclusion of post-mortem tissue from patients who had suffered from dementia unrelated 
to Alzheimer’s disease as well as patients with no clinical symptoms of dementia. 
Flutemetamol bound to regions of brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease (temporal cortex and the 
hippocampus) in tissue sections from Alzheimer disease patients but did not bind to similar sections of 
brain obtained from the two control groups. These results confirm that flutemetamol binds to the amyloid 
pathology prevalent in dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease. 
Characterization of flutemetamol binding in autopsy brains from [11C]PiB imaged subjects (B067078, non 
GLP) 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 16/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This study was conducted to provide histopathological characterization of flutemetamol binding to AD 
pathology (including amyloid β plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and neurofibrillary tangles) in post 
mortem brain tissue sections, to examine the degree to which binding of [3H]flutemetamol correlates with 
binding  of  [3H]PiB  in  brain  tissue  homogenates  from  amyloid-positive  and  amyloid-negative  (control) 
autopsy cases, and to correlate post mortem measures of flutemetamol and PiB with ante mortem PiB PET 
retention in the same subjects. 
The extent of amyloid β aggregates detected post mortem by flutemetamol was similar to that using PiB 
and correlated with the PET detection of [11C]PiB retention in vivo (Figure 3 below). These results indicate 
that flutemetamol (18F) is comparable to [11C]PiB in its ability to bind brain fibrillar β amyloid pathology. 
These data demonstrate that flutemetamol and PiB have similar patterns of labelling amyloid β plaques 
and vascular deposits in post mortem fixed neocortical tissue sections. The results suggest that in vivo 
PET retention of flutemetamol (18F), in brains that  contain amyloid β deposits reflects neocortical Aβ 
plaque load in a manner similar to [11C]PiB imaging. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific studies have been performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects on hERG tail current (B067043, GLP) 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014

Flutemetamol  did  not  cause  hERG  tail  current  inhibition  when  compared  with  vehicle,  indicating  no 
inhibition of the hERG channel in this assay. The lowest measured concentration is 60 times higher than 
the theoretical maximum plasma concentrations of flutemetamol that may be achieved in humans after a 
single injection of 20 μg flutemetamol into the 3 L plasma volume of the standard man. 
Effects of flutemetamol on cardiovascular function in the telemetered dog (B067003, GLP) 
This study was conducted to determine the effects of intravenously administered flutemetamol on the 
cardiovascular system of conscious (telemetered) male Beagle dogs. No treatment related effects were 
observed on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG parameters. 
A single intravenous administration of flutemetamol to male dogs at doses up to 9.3 μg/kg was generally 
well tolerated and without test item related adverse effects. The NOAEL is considered to be 6.0 μg/kg, 
equivalent to 10 multiples of the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg, following adjustment for 
body surface area. 
Effects on the respiratory system in dog (B067040, GLP) 
Respiratory function was measured in male and female Beagle dogs on day 10 of the 14-day repeat-dose 
toxicity study (study B067040, section 4.2). The animals were treated with doses of 7.5 and 15 μg/kg 
flutemetamol. Respiration rate, tidal volume and minute volume were recorded. There were no effects 
considered  to  be  treatment  related.  The  NOAEL  is  14  μg/kg,  equivalent  to  23  multiples  of  the 
recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg. 
Modified Irwin test in the rat (B067004, GLP) 
This study was conducted to determine the effects of intravenously administered flutemetamol on the 
gross behavioural and physiological state of male Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were intravenously 
administered 1.5, 5 and 16 μg/kg flutemetamol and a positive control (2 mg/kg chlorpromazine). The 
animals  were  observed  and  assessed  on  42  behavioural  and  physiological  parameters.  No  treatment 
related effects were observed. 
The  actual  highest  administered  dose  may  have  contained  92%  of  the  nominal  value  due  to  possible 
adsorption,  therefore  the  NOAEL  is  14.7  μg/kg  flutemetamol,  equivalent  to  7  multiples  of  the 
recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg, following adjustment for body surface area. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific studies have been performed to date. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
Biodistribution studies of flutemetamol (18F) in rats have shown that it is rapidly distributed to the brain 
but not retained in the absence of amyloid β deposits. Distribution and elimination from other tissues is 
also  rapid.  Excretion  is  mainly  via  the  gastrointestinal  route.  The  inclusion  of  polysorbate  80  in  the 
formulation  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  to  decrease  adsorption  and  increase  solubility  did  not  change  the 
biodistribution profile. 
During  the  flutemetamol  (18F)  development  the  purification  method  changed  from  high  performance 
liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  to  solid  phase  extraction  (SPE).  A  bridging  biodistribution  study  was 
conducted with a test item purified by SPE. 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 18/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolism studies in rat and baboon detected at least two radiolabelled metabolites in the plasma. In 
vitro  metabolism  studies  showed  that  the  major  metabolite  was  de  N-demethylated  product.  After 
injection of flutemetamol (18F) in the ALZ103 clinical trail, human plasma samples from the subjects were 
analysed  by  HPLC,  showing  that  metabolism  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  occurred  rapidly  and  at  least  two 
radiolabelled  metabolites  were  detected.  Additional  studies  in  the  rat  showed  a  rapid  metabolism  of 
flutemetamol  (18F)  and  the  presence  of  two  radiolabelled  metabolites  in  the  plasma  that  were  not 
detected in the brain. 
Protein binding studies using equilibrium dialysis in human, dog and rat plasma indicated that plasma 
protein binding of [3H]flutemetamol was greater than 95%. However, flutemetamol is rapidly eliminated 
from blood after intravenous administration to rat and dog.

Methods of analysis 
Quantification of flutemetamol in plasma samples using liquid chromatography with fluorescence 
detection (M067003 and V067003) 
Flutemetamol  in  rat,  dog  an  human  plasma  samples  was  determined  by  a  HPLC  with  fluorescence 
detection.  The  range  of  the  assay  was  approximately  0.3  to  30  ng/mL  plasma  with  a  lower  limit  of 
quantification of 0.3 ng/mL. This method of analysis (M067003) was also used in the toxicokinetic studies. 
The validation of method V067003 was performed as a non-GLP study in a GLP environment.  
Adsorption to dosing equipment (B067058) 
Flutemetamol is a lipophilic compound with limited solubility in aqueous solution (<10 μg/mL) and has the 
potential to adsorb onto dosing equipment used in nonclinical studies. This study investigated the extent 
that Flutemetamol Solution for Injection can adsorb onto the dosing equipment used in the nonclinical 
studies. 
The recovery values (65 - 92%) were used to represent the maximum adsorption that could occur and 
they have been applied to estimate the lowest likely doses administered in each of the nonclinical studies 
that used the specific dosing equipment. Hence, these data impact the NOAEL for each of the studies.  
Absorption  
No specific absorption studies have been performed.  
Distribution 
Biodistribution of fluorine-18 after administration of a formulation of flutemetamol (18F) (B067059, 
B067060 and B067062, non GLP) 
After  administration  of  flutemetamol  (18F),  radioactivity  was  rapidly  distributed  throughout  the  body 
including the brain. Initial uptake in the brain was 4.4%, but it is not retained in the absence of amyloid 
β deposits. The initial uptake of radioactivity was predominantly in the muscle (31%), the liver (23%) and 
the small intestine wall (8%). Uptake was also observed in other organs and tissues such as the skin, 
kidneys, bone, lung and fat. Data are included in the following table: 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 20/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Between 20 minutes and 4 hours after administration, the amount excreted in urine continued to rise to 
a final level of 10% at 4 hours. In all other organs and tissues, retention decreased up to 4 hours. The 
main route of excretion was gastrointestinal with radioactivity in the small intestine contents peaking at 
2 hours (72%) and in the large intestine contents at 4 hours (49%). There was no evidence for prolonged 
retention of significant quantities of the radioactivity in any organ or tissue.  
The  clinical  formulation  includes  0.5%  polysorbate  80,  thus  a  bridging  biodistribution  study  using  a 
formulation  containing  1%  polysorbate  80  was  conducted  in  rats  (B067060).  No  biodistribution 
differences were observed compared with the study that did not include polysorbate 80, including uptake 
and clearance from the brain. 
A study to investigate whether the distribution of radioactivity after administration of [18F]AH-110690 is 
affected by the presence of radioactive impurities in the formulation (B067062, non GLP) 
The synthesis process of flutemetamol (18F) has been scaled up for use in the clinic and this can result in 
the formation of a significant percentage of radioactive impurities. It was established that the presence of 
radioactive  impurities  generated  during  the  high-activity  synthesis  process  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  (at 
levels of 25 and 17 % total radioactivity) did significantly affect the biodistribution profile of radioactivity 
post-administration. The presence of these radioactive impurities (thought to be radiolysis products of 
[18F]flutemetamol) was associated with elevated retention of radioactivity in the blood, reduced initial 
Vizamyl

distribution to the muscle and brain, and a slowed transit of radioactivity through the liver and into the 
small intestine. Elevated bone retention was also observed in proportion to the amount of [18F] fluoride 
present. 
The decrease in initial distribution of radioactivity to the brain observed with the lower RCP Test Items is 
an important observation and was proportional to the percentage of radioactive impurities present. This 
may indicate that the radioactive impurities examined do not cross the blood brain barrier. Consistent 
with this there was no significant retention of radioactivity in the brain associated with the lower RCP Test 
Items.  Therefore,  whilst  the  presence  of  such  radioactive  impurities  in  a  formulation  of  flutemetamol 
(18F) should not impair background image quality in the brain (except the contribution from elevated 
blood  retention),  reduced  delivery  of    to  the  brain  may  be  expected  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of 
flutemetamol (18F) radioactive impurities present.  
The other major finding of this study was that the lower RCP Test Items were associated with a slowed 
transit of radioactivity through the liver and into the small intestine (in parallel with the elevated blood 
retention observed). It is likely that the change in biodistribution profile associated with these lower RCP 
Test Items will not detrimentally affect dosimetry (the dose to the intestine wall should be reduced and 
the increase in bone retention observed is not thought to significantly affect the overall effective dose). It 
is  also  important  to  note  that  significant  levels  of  radioactive  impurities  did  not  accumulate  in  any 
radiosensitive organ or tissue. 
The  formulations  used  in  this  study  and  the  previous  one  were  produced  using  HPLC  purification  and 
some, but not all, of the radioactive impurities present in this preparation are expected to be present in 
the  drug  product  produced  using  SPE  purification.  Additional  radioactive  impurities  now  known  to  be 
present  in  the  SPE  purified  drug  product  that  were  not  present  in  the  HPLC  purified  drug  product; 
therefore an additional study was conducted (B067075). 
Biodistribution of flurorine-18 after administration of a formulation of flutemetamol (18F) prepared using 
the FASTlab with SPE purification (B067075, non GLP) 
As  mentioned  above,  the  different  method  of  purification  changed  the  impurity  profile  and 
non-radiolabelled impurities typical of those in the proposed commercial drug product were present in this 
formulation. The study was carried out with two different flutemetamol (18F) preparations with RCP of 
98.1 and 97.5%.  
The biodistribution pattern for the SPE purified flutemetamol (18F) was similar to that reported for an 
HPLC  purified  flutemetamol  (18F)  preparation  in  male  rats  (B067059)  with  no  biologically  significant 
differences between the distribution profiles in any of the organs and tissues, including brain.  
Plasma protein binding of flutemetamol in rat, dog and human (B067049, B067057, non GLP) 
The  extent  of  plasma  protein  binding  by  flutemetamol  was  determined  using  the  equilibrium  dialysis 
methodology. In studies using human plasma and [3H]flutemetamol, >97% binding (1 hour study) was 
observed  following  equilibrium.  Additional  studies  with  rat  and  dog  plasma  were  performed  using  the 
same methodology, and showed >97% binding to rat plasma proteins, and >95% binding to dog plasma 
proteins following 3 hours equilibrium dialysis at 37ºC. These results indicate that flutemetamol binds 
extensively to plasma proteins, and that the measured protein binding is similar in human, dog and rat. 
Metabolism

Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 22/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Several studies were conducted to investigate the in vitro metabolism of flutemetamol by incubation with 
hepatic  S9  fraction  obtained  from  human,  dog,  mouse  and  rat.  The  major  metabolite  detected  after 
incubation of flutemetamol in hepatic S9 from mouse, dog and human, and from Aroclor 1254 induced rat 
was the N-demethylated product. No metabolism was observed in control heat inactivated or β-NADPH 
deficient hepatic S9 fractions. This data indicate that metabolism in the human is similar to that of the rat 
and dog. 
In  order  to  allow  correlation  with  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  studies,  additional  rat  metabolism 
studies were performed in the presence of Aroclor 1254 induced hepatic S9 fraction and non-induced rat 
hepatic S9 fraction (B067013).  
After  incubation  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  with  mouse  and  dog  hepatic  S9  (B067046)  a  slower  rate  of 
metabolite  formation  was  detected.  After  30  minutes  incubation,  more  than  90%  of  the  radioactivity 
added to dog hepatic S9 fraction and 72% of the radioactivity in mouse hepatic S9 was still associated 
with  flutemetamol.  In  contrast  to  the  [14C]flutemetamol  study  B067045,  this  study  shows  that 
flutemetamol (18F) is not significantly metabolised in the presence of either dog or mouse hepatic S9 
fraction. As there should be no difference between the metabolism of flutemetamol in the two studies 
B067045 and B067046, this confirms the hypothesis that the differences in metabolic profiles of [14C] 
flutemetamol and flutemetamol (18F) are likely to be due to the different synthetic routes, presence of 
impurities in the [14C]flutemetamol test item and position of radioactive label. 
In addition, no metabolism or degradation was observed after incubation of flutemetamol (18F) with rat, 
dog or human plasma for up to 3 hours. In human whole blood, low amounts of two metabolites were 
detected after a 3-hour incubation. 
In vivo metabolism of [11C]flutemetamol (B067018, B067019, non GLP) 
After intravenous administration of [11C]flutemetamol to rat and baboon, [11C]flutemetamol was rapidly 
metabolised and at least 2 hydrophilic products were observed in both species. In humans (clinical trial 
ALZ103 Phase 1), it was observed that the metabolism of the intravenously administered flutemetamol 
(18F) occurred rapidly (only 25% of the parent compound was detected in the circulation 20 minutes post 
injection and 10% was detected at 180 minutes post injection) and at least two hydrophilic metabolites 
were detected.  
In vivo metabolites of flutemetamol (18F) in plasma, brain and bile (B067071, B067070, non GLP) 
Flutemetamol  (18F)  was  intravenously  administered  to  rats  and  plasma,  brain  and  bile  samples  were 
taken at 2, 20 and 60 minutes post-injection. In the plasma, the radioactivity rapidly decreased from 58% 
at 2 minutes to 13% at 60 minutes post injection. Two major and one minor radiolabelled metabolites 
were identified, all less lipophilic than the parent compound. In the brain, flutemetamol (18F) accounted 
for 97, 85 and 75% of the total activity at 2, 20 and 60 minutes post-injection, respectively, with only two 
minor metabolites observed. 
Excretion 
The biodistribution study with flutemetamol (18F) in rats (B067059, B067060 and B067062) indicates 
that radioactivity is predominantly excreted in faeces (approximately 80% by 4 hours post-injection) with 
minor excretion in urine (approximately 10% by 4 hours post-injection). 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Impact of anti-amyloid therapy MAB31 on the distribution of flutemetamol (18F) in Wistar rats (B067064, 
non GLP)

flutemetamol (18F) is likely to be administrated to patients who are receiving anti-amyloid therapies. 
Therefore, a drug interaction study (in male Wistar rats) was performed to understand the effects of the 
experimental therapeutic MAB31 on the distribution of flutemetamol (18F) in rats. MAB31 is a monoclonal 
antibody being developed by Hoffmann-La Roche as a novel anti-β-amyloid therapeutic agent. The study 
results indicate that MAB31 pre-dosing did not affect the brain delivery and clearance characteristics of 
[18F]flutemetamol. In addition, MAB31 did not influence the biodistribution of flutemetamol (18F) to any 
peripheral tissues, and the excretion profile of flutemetamol (18F) was unaffected. 
Although the diagnostic target β amyloid plaques were not present in the animals, the initial uptake of 
activity  into  normal  brain  tissue  is  a  good  indicator  of  the  potential  delivery  of  activity  to  the  target 
plaques.  In  addition,  a  previous  in  vitro  study  has  showed  that  MAB31  and  flutemetamol  (18F)  have 
different amyloid β binding sites. Therefore, this study shows that pre-dosing with MAB31 (10 mg/kg) 24 
hours before the administration of flutemetamol (18F) did not significantly affect the biodistribution of 
radioactivity observed in rats. 
The interactions of flutemetamol with a panel of drugs commonly prescribed to Alzheimer’s patients were 
assessed in the clinical trials (see clinical section of the assessment report). Taking into account the very 
low amount of flutemetamol (18F) and its rapid clearance from circulation, no additional pharmacokinetic 
interaction studies are considered necessary. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Single-dose  intravenous  kinetics  study  with  Flutemetamol  Solution  for  Injection  in  the  Wistar  rat 
(B067055, non GLP) 
An exploratory kinetic study was conducted to investigate the availability of the test item in peripheral 
blood and the related exposures after a single dose infusion (60 μg/kg) into the tail vein of male Wistar 
rats. Cmax was obtained 3 minutes after the end of the infusion, at the first sampling point, with a value 
of 8.9 ± 0.8 ng/mL. In addition, plasma samples prepared from peripheral blood contained the test item 
in detectable amounts after a single dose, confirming that test item was administrated to all animals in 
the study according to the study plan.

was 20 mL/kg. The animals were euthanized either 1 or 14 days post-injection.

No  mortalities  were  observed  in  either  of  the  sexes.  There  was  no  evidence  of  any  effect  related  to 
treatment  with  flutemetamol  in  the  clinical  signs,  clinical  chemistry,  haematology,  body  weight,  body 
weight changes or gross or microscopic pathology results of this study. There was evidence of an effect of 
the  vehicle  on  clinical  signs.  In  groups  treated  with  vehicle  alone  and  with  flutemetamol,  altered 
behaviour  was  seen  during  the  first  10  minutes  after  dosing  (ataxia).  Females  showed  reduced  liver 
weight, body weight changes and microscopic observations of prominent glycogen depletion in the liver. 
Venous/perivenous necrosis at the injection site was observed in both male and female rats. All these 
results are consistent with the 7% ethanol of the vehicle. 
After adjustment for adsorption to the infusion equipment (study B067058), the NOAEL was estimated to 
be 78 μg/kg, which is equivalent to 38 times the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg (0.333 
μg/kg, assuming a 60 kg human), following adjustment for body surface area.  
Expanded acute toxicity study in rats (B067069, GLP) 
In this study the effect of dosing Wistar rats (5/sex/group) with an intravenous Flutemetamol Solution for 
Injection  produced  using  the  FASTlab  SPE  process  was  evaluated.  The  test  item  contained  all 
non-radioactive chemical impurities expected to be present in the clinical drug product, although it was 
supplemented with added flutemetamol and an impurity AH111832 to increase their concentrations. The 
maximum single dose was 96 μg/kg, 192 μg/kg  flutemetamol after the two doses, whereas low dose 
groups received a total daily dose of 38 μg/kg.  
There were no premature deaths in this study. Decreased activity and ataxia were observed immediately 
after dosing and considered to be related to the ethanol of the vehicle. Minor changes in some clinical 
pathology  parameters  were  not  considered  significant.  Although  statistically  significant  differences  in 
lymphocyte counts were observed on Day 2, they were not considered to be of toxicological significance 
primarily due to the degree of individual variation and the ranges seen within control and treated groups 
when data from Days 2 and 14 were compared. 
There were no test item related macroscopic findings. Microscopic minimal changes in the adrenals and 
kidney showed no relationship to dose, and were not considered significant. There were no local effects of 
the test item at the injection site. NOAEL: 192 μg/kg (2 doses of 96 μg/kg), equivalent to 93 times the 
recommended  maximum  human  dose  of  20  μg  (0.333  μg/kg),  following  adjustment  for  body  surface 
area.

7-Day dose range finding study in rats (B067039, GLP) 
Wistar rats (3/sex/group) were administered flutemetamol once daily for 7 days at three nominal doses 
(15, 30, 60 μg/kg) by intravenous administration via a tail vein. There were no premature deaths. Signs 
of dizziness/uncoordinated movements were observed in both the vehicle control group and the high dose 
group during treatment days 1 to 4. This was attributed to the presence of ethanol in the vehicle. No 
adverse test item related changes in body  weight, food intake, absolute or relative organ weights, or 
gross findings at necropsy were found, although a minimal increase in the mean weight of epididymides 
was observed in high dose males. 
NOAEL: 60 μg/kg/day. Based on this, the doses used in this study were proposed for the subsequent 
14-day repeated dose study with Flutemetamol Solution for Injection (B067056).  
14-Day repeated-dose toxicity study in rats (B067056, GLP) 
Flutemetamol was intravenously administered to Wistar rats (10/sex/group) at the nominal doses of 15, 
30 and 60 μg/kg for 14 days.  
Seven animals died immediately after administration. Deaths occurred in groups that had been treated 
with either vehicle alone or test item, mortalities were not sex or dose-related. Therefore, these deaths 
were considered to be related to the injection procedure itself. 
There were no overt treatment related adverse effects in this study. NOAEL: 27 μg/kg, equivalent to 13 
times the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg (0.333 μg/kg), following adjustment for body 
surface area. 
There were no biologically relevant differences in the TK parameters between days 1 and 14, or between 
males and females. The increase in plasma concentration was approximately proportional to the increase 
in dose. 
Combined single-dose and 7-day dose range finding study in dogs (B067038, GLP) 
Flutemetamol was administered by intravenous injection to Beagle dogs (one male and two females) on 
7 consecutive days in order to establish suitable doses for subsequent studies. All animals survived and 
there were no clinical signs related to the test item in this study. No effects on body weight, food intake, 
water  consumption,  biochemistry,  hematology,  coagulation,  electrocardiograms,  organ  weights  or 
macroscopic findings related to the treatment were found. NOAEL: 15 μg/kg/day. 
14-Day repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs (B067040, GLP) 
This study  was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of  flutemetamol when administered by intravenous 
injection to Beagle dogs for 2 week at a nominal doses of 7.5 and 15 μg/kg/day. No premature deaths 
occurred.  There  were  no  clinical  signs  of  effects  on  body  weight,  food  intake,  ophthalmoscopy, 
biochemistry,  hematology,  coagulation,  urine,  electrocardiograms,  respiration,  organ  weights, 
macroscopic or microscopic findings related to the treatment. Reddening and histological inflammatory 
changes at the injection sites were considered to be related to the physical injection procedure and not 
directly related to treatment with flutemetamol. 
After adjustment for adsorption to the infusion equipment the high dose is 14 μg/kg/day, and this dose is 
considered the NOAEL, which is equivalent to 23 times the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg 
(0.333 μg/kg), following adjustment for body surface area.

Ames-microbial mutagenesis test (B067005, GLP) 
The flutemetamol concentrations used in this test were from 1.5 to 50 μg/plate (the solubility limit of the 
test  article).Reproducible,  concentration-related  and  statistically  significant  increases  in  revertant 
numbers were observed in strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 after treatment in presence of S9. The 
increases  in  revertant  numbers  were  of  a  sufficient  magnitude  to  be  considered  clear  evidence  of 
flutemetamol mutagenic activity in strain TA98 in the presence of S9. No other concentration-related and 
reproducible increases in revertant numbers were observed in any other strain. 
In addition, statistically significant increases in revertant numbers were also observed following TA102 
treatments in the absence and presence of S9. They were considered to be due to chance events and not 
to be indicative of flutemetamol mutagenic activity. 
Mutation  at  the  thymidine  kinase  (TK)  locus  of  mouse  lymphoma  L5178Y  cells  using  the  microtitre 
fluctuation technique (B067006, GLP) 
The concentration of flutemetamol was in the range of 1 to 5 μg/mL (maximum achievable dose). 
In  absence  of  S9,  in  experiment  1  (3-hour  treatment)  statistically  significant  increases  in  mutant 
frequency were observed at 3-5 μg/mL and a highly significant concentration-related linear trend was 
obtained.  In  experiments  2  and  3  (3-hour  treatment)  no  statistically  significant  increases  in  mutant 
frequency were observed at any concentration. In experiment 3 with 24-hour treatment, a significant 
increase in mutant frequency was observed at 4.5 μg/mL, but not at the maximum feasible concentration 
of 5 μg/mL. However, a highly significant concentration-related linear trend was obtained. 
In  presence  of  S9,  in  experiment  1  and  3  (3-hour  treatment)  an  increase  in  mutant  frequency  was 
observed  after  treatment  at  the  highest  concentration  tested  (5  μg/mL).  However,  in  experiment  2 
(3-hour treatment), no significant increases in mutant frequency were found.  
It is concluded that flutemetamol shows evidence of mutagenic activity in the presence of S9 and shows 
equivocal evidence of mutagenic activity in the absence of S9 in this test system.

Acute rat bone marrow micronucleus assay (B067017, GLP) 
Flutemetamol  was  intravenously  administered  to  male  rats  at  60,  120,  240  μg/kg  twice  on  two 
consecutive days (6 rats/group). Cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control (20 mg/kg as a single 
dose). 
No  signs  of  treatment-related  toxicity  were  observed.  After  adjustment  for  adsorption  to  the  infusion 
equipment the administered dose is considered to have been 156 μg/kg, which is equivalent to 75 times 
the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg, following adjustment for body surface area. 
14-Day repeat-dose rat micronucleus assay (B067056, GLP) 
Flutemetamol was administered by intravenous injection to male and female Wistar rats once a day for 2 
weeks at the nominal doses of 15, 30 and 60 μg/kg. In this study the mean number of polychromatic 
erythrocytes was not increased after treatment with the test item, indicating that flutemetamol was not 
cytotoxic  to  the  bone  marrow  under  the  conditions  of  this  study.  Following  the  adjustment  due  to 
adsorption to the infusion equipment, the highest dose administered is 27 μg/kg/day, which is equivalent 
to 13 times the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg. 
Measurement  of  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  (UDS)  in  rat  liver  using  an  in  vivo/in  vitro  procedure 
(B067016, GLP) 
Nominal  doses  of  30  and  60  μg/kg  were  administered  intravenously  to  male  rats  (4/group).  Two 
experiments were carried out, and animals were sacrificed at 2 to 4 hours (experiment 2) or 12 to 14 
hours (experiment 1) post injection. 
Flutemetamol showed no detectable genotoxic activity in this study. After adjustment for adsorption to 
the infusion equipment the maximum administered dose was considered to have been 39 μg/kg, which is 
equivalent to 19 times the recommended maximum human dose of 20 μg. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted, because Flutemetamol (18F) Injection is a diagnostic 
imaging  agent  intended  for  infrequent  administration  with  significant  intervals  between  treatments. 
There is no evidence of pre-neoplastic lesions in repeat-dose toxicity studies and no long-term retention 
of  parent  compound  or  metabolites  resulting  in  local  tissue  reactions  or  other  pathophysiological 
responses. Although the in vitro genotoxicity test indicated some potential risk, the three in vivo tests 
were negative and the risk of genotoxicity, when administered as recommended, is considered to be low. 
Considering the absence of a significant genotoxic risk and the intended clinical use of flutemetamol, and 
according to the Guideline on the need of carcinogenicity studies of pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/140/95 
S1A), no carcinogenicity studies are required for [18F] flutemetamol. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Potential adverse effects on fertility of flutemetamol have been assessed by an evaluation of the male and 
female  reproductive  organs  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  showing  no  adverse 
treatment  related  effects.  Based  on  the  results  from  biodistribution  studies  in  rats  with  the  [18F] 
flutemetamol, radiation dosimetry calculations have been made to estimate exposure of the gonads, and 
therefore allow an assessment of risk in relation to possible adverse effects on fertility. The absorbed 
radiation dose in the gonads of rats after administration of [18F] flutemetamol was calculated to be 0.0605 
mGy/MBq to the ovaries and 0.0427 mGy/MBq to the testes. No embryonic or fetal toxicity studies have 
been conducted.

Taking into account the intended clinical use of the drug in elder patients and that the drug is going to be 
administered  on  few  occasions,  no  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  are  considered 
necessary.

Study B067040 
In  the  study  B067040  toxicokinetic  analysis  revealed  the  presence  of  the  active  substance  even  in 
pre-dose samples. Since the active substance was found in samples taken before the first administration 
a post-collection contamination is likely. 
Due to the small amounts the finding of active substance in pre-dose samples is not considered to impair 
the results of the study. 
The  following  overview  was  provided  to  compare  the  animal  exposure  in  the  toxicity  studies  with 
exposure  in  humans  and  to  provide  an  estimate  on  safety  factors.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the 
maximum human dose (MHD).

No signs of systemic toxicity were observed in the animals (New Zealand White rabbits) during the 8-day 
observation  period.  No  local  signs  of  irritation  were  noted  after  intravenous,  intra-arterial  or 
intramuscular  administration  (concentration  of  3  μg/mL  and  a  dose  volume  of  0.3  mL  for  each 
administration route). Perivenous administration caused mild, early onset and transient effects (slight 
erythema). No microscopic changes were noted in the animals with any route of administration.  
After  adjustment  for  adsorption  to  the  infusion  equipment,  the  estimated  maximum  exposure  was  2 
μg/mL flutemetamol by the intravenous, perivenous and intra-arterial administration, and 2.8 μg/mL by 
the intramuscular administration. 
Primary skin irritation study in rabbits (B067042, GLP) 
Mild, early-onset and transient signs of irritation such as erythema and edema were detected after topical 
semi-occlusive application of 0.5 mL. These effects were reversible and no longer evident 48 hours after 
treatment. After adjustment for adsorption to the infusion equipment, the estimated maximum exposure 
to the skin was approximately 1.4 μg. 
Acute eye irritation/corrosion in rabbits (B067044, GLP) 
Mild, early-onset and transient ocular changes were observed after application of 0.1 mL (reddening of 
the  conjunctive  and  sclera).  These  effects  were  reversible  and  were  no  longer  evident  24  hours  after 
treatment. After adjustment for adsorption to the infusion equipment, the estimated maximum exposure 
to the skin was approximately 0.28 μg. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
No antigenicity studies were conducted. 
Immunotoxicity 
No immunotoxicity studies were conducted. 
Dependence 
No dependence studies were conducted. 
Metabolites 
No additional studies on metabolites were conducted. 
Studies on impurities 
No  specific  studies  on  impurities  have  been  conducted.  There  were  5  flutemetamol-related  impurities 
present in the clinical drug product that were not present in the test item used for the majority of the 
nonclinical studies.  
Although an in silico structure-activity assessment showed that only three of the five impurities are likely 
to pose a similar genotoxic hazard as flutemetamol, a cautious approach was taken by assuming that 
flutemetamol and related impurities and their metabolites behave in a similar way and that they may all 
represent a genotoxic hazard. 
According to the Guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006) and 
Questions  and  answers  on 
the 
“Guideline  on 
the 
limits  of  genotoxic 
impurities”

related impurities of no more than 6 μg/mL was set, and is considered as a conservative value in relation 
to the intended exposure.  
The potential risk of the excipients ethanol and polysorbate 80, and of the presence of acetaldehyde as an 
impurity in the clinical formulation were assessed. There are no reports of any genotoxic risk associated 
directly with polysorbate 80 and the concentration of acetaldehyde in the drug product is below 12 μg/mL 
below  the  TTC  of  120  μg  for  a  single  dose  (in  the  EU).  Ethanol  is  not  directly  genotoxic  but  its  first 
metabolite is acetaldehyde which is genotoxic at high doses and following prolonged chronic exposure. 
However, the amount of ethanol in the maximum recommended injection volume of Flutemetamol (18F) 
Injection would be metabolized within 8 minutes in a patient with normal liver function, and the level of 
ethanol in the drug product is low compared to recreational use of alcohol and is not considered to pose 
a significant genotoxic risk. 
2.3.5.  Other studies 
Radiation dosimetry (B067066, B067065, non-GLP)  
In study B047059, quantitative biodistribution and excretion data following intravenous bolus injection of 
a formulation of flutemetamol (18F) in Wistar rats were obtained up to 4-hours post injection. The pooled 
data in each organ, tissue or excreta were used to calculate cumulative activities per unit administered 
activity (see table 5). 
Table 5. Cumulative activities per unit administered activity for Wistar rats injected intravenously with a 
formulation of [18F]flutemetamol 
Absorbed  doses  per  unit  administered  activity  and  the  effective  dose  per  unit  administered  were 
calculated and are included in the next table (table 6). The three organs receiving the highest absorbed 
radiation dose per unit administered activity were the upper large intestine, small intestine and urinary 
bladder, reflecting the predominantly intestinal route of excretion of flutemetamol. Free [18F]fluoride may 
be present in the formulation up to 10%. The effect of 10% free [18F] on the effective dose has been 
estimated and would only result in a small and insignificant reduction of less than 3%, due to less activity 
in the gastrointestinal tract and mores in the bone and voided urine.

Osmolality and haemolytic potential (B067061, non GLP) 
This study was conducted with the drug product vehicle used at that time: sodium phosphate 14 mM, 7% 
ethanol (v/v), 0.5% polysorbate 80 (w/v), pH 7.2. The osmolality was approximately 1250 mOsm/kg. 
After the incubation of 0.002 to 0.2 mL of the formulation with 2 mL of human blood, haemolysis was not 
detected.  The highest concentration tested in vitro is approximately 50-fold greater than when 10 mL are 
homogeneously  distributed  in  5  liters  of  blood  in  the  human  body.  Considering  that  no  indications  of 
haemolysis were detected in non-clinical and clinical studies (22 subjects during the Phase 1 clinical trial 
(ALZ103) and 72 subjects during the Phase 2 clinical trial (ALZ201).), and that sodium chloride 0.9% 
(w/v) has been added to the formulation during development to raise the osmolality to values close to 
physiological tonicity, no further studies are required. 
2.3.6.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A  study  for  the  determination  of  the  partition  coefficient  for  flutemetamol  provided  by  the  applicant 
performed as described by OECD 123 Guideline was used. A pH – buffer of 7 was applied to cover the 
highest logD. The study is considered to be valid and should be used in risk assessment. The measured 
value logD = 4.27 falls below the trigger value of 4.5 used for PBT screening. Therefore a PBT assessment 
is not necessary.  
Flutemetamol PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5.

2.3.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  in  vitro  pharmacology  studies  suggest  that  [3H]flutemetamol  is  able  to  label  cored  and  diffuse 
amyloid β deposits and neuritic plaques. The affinity of flutemetamol (18F) for neurofibrillary tangles is 
much lower than the affinity for β-amyloid (30-fold lower). 
The binding of flutemetamol to 65 central nervous system targets other than amyloid was studied in vitro 
(B067081). Only weak inhibition (34%) of binding of the reference compound to the non-human P2Y 
receptor was observed. This class of receptors is expressed in both the periphery and throughout the 
brain on both neurones and glia. The limited number of studies assessing human AD brain tissues has not 
demonstrated  an  increase  in  the  expression  of  any  P2Y  subtype.  Therefore,  while  weak  binding  of 
flutemetamol to P2Y receptors may contribute to the background of the images, it will not likely have an 
impact on the imaging efficacy of 18F-flutemetamol. 
In  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  flutemetamol  did  not  show  any  effect  in  the  cardiovascular, 
respiratory and behavioural parameters. 
Biodistribution studies of flutemetamol (18F) in rats have shown that it is rapidly distributed to the brain 
but it is not retained in the absence of amyloid β deposits. Distribution to, and elimination from other 
tissues  is  also  rapid  and  excretion  is  primarily  via  the  gastrointestinal  route.  Significant  levels  of 
radioactive impurities did not accumulate in any radiosensitive organ or tissue.  
In vitro studies have demonstrated that the metabolic profile of flutemetamol in hepatic S9 obtained from 
rat (Aroclor 1254 induced), mouse, dog and human are broadly comparable. No unique metabolic species 
were observed in human.  
In the in vivo studies in rat and baboon, a total of 3 radiolabelled products, including [11C]flutemetamol, 
were detected in plasma. In rats, two major and one minor radiolabelled metabolites were identified, all 
less lipophilic than the parent compound. Apparently, the Applicant did not identify the chemical structure 
of any of the metabolites found in the in vitro or in vivo studies, or in the clinical trials. The interactions of 
flutemetamol with a panel of drugs commonly prescribed to Alzheimer’s patients were assessed in the 
clinical trials.

All general toxicology studies were conducted according to GLP. The toxicity studies in a rodent and a 
non-rodent  species  are  limited  to  a  maximum  duration  of  14-days  using  not  radioactively  labeled 
flutemetamol  to  investigate  the  toxicological  properties  of  flutemetamol.  Although  according  to  the 
guideline CPMP/ICH/286/95 M3 (R2) the duration of the pivotal toxicity studies to support marketing of 
treatments of a duration up to 2 weeks should be of 1 month, considering the low dose, the short plasma 
half-life and the lack of systemic accumulation of flutemetamol, the duration of these studies is justified. 
Flutemetamol were tested in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests with conflicting results. Considering 
the single usage and the low maximum human dose and that the final drug product will be radiolabelled 
and  can  therefore  be  regarded  as  potentially  genotoxic  by  itself,  the  genotoxic  potential  of 
non-radioactive flutemetamol is regarded as very low compared to the genotoxic potential of the positron 
emission itself.  
The Applicant conducted three local tolerance studies in rabbits with different routes of administration. No 
specific studies on impurities have been conducted. There were 5 flutemetamol-related impurities present 
in the clinical drug product that were not present in the test item used for the majority of the nonclinical 
studies.  
The radiation dosimetry estimates were based on the results of a distribution study in rats (B067056). 
The three organs receiving the highest absorbed radiation dose per unit administered activity were the 
upper large intestine, small intestine and urinary bladder, reflecting the predominantly intestinal route of 
excretion of flutemetamol. 
Flutemetamol PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5.  
2.3.8.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package presented by the Applicant is considered appropriate. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  company  presented  the  following  dataset  to  demonstrate  the  clinical  efficacy  of  PET  with 
flutemetamol  (18F):  three  key  studies  (phase  III  studies  GE067-007,  GE067-015  and  GE067-021), 
supported by another eight clinical studies, and a pooled analyses of all 11 clinical studies composing the 
flutemetamol (18F) clinical development program (see table 8 below, Study GE067-021 was an electronic 
reader training study and is not included in the table).  
The  two  Phase  1  studies  ([ALZ103]  and  [GE067-014])  assessed  the  biodistribution  and  dosimetry  of 
flutemetamol (18F) in HV (white and Asian, respectively) and in patients with probable AD.   
The Phase 2 study [ALZ201] evaluated the ability of flutemetamol (18F) images to differentiate between 
HV and subjects with AD, and to determine the proportions of aMCI subjects with normal and abnormal 
flutemetamol (18F) images.  
Seven of the 8 Phase 3 studies assessed the diagnostic performance and reproducibility of the blinded 
visual assessment of flutemetamol (18F) PET images.  In all but one study (the electronic reader training 
study, GE067-021), image readers were trained in person by a consultant nuclear medicine physician who 
used materials provided by GE Healthcare; in the electronic reader training study (Study GE067-021), 
readers were training using an electronic training program, also provided by GE Healthcare.

The 8th Phase 3 study, [GE067-005], assessed the ability of flutemetamol (18F) images to predict the 
subsequent development of AD in aMCI subjects.  
Populations studied in the clinical development program included European and US healthy volunteers 
(HVs) subjects with aMCI, pAD, known or suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and subjects 
with a life expectancy of 1 year or less (regardless of primary diagnosis).   
In  addition,  22 Japanese  subjects  (14  HVs  and  8  AD  subjects)  were  enrolled  in  one  of  the  2  Phase  1 
studies.

GCP 
The clinical trial programme has partly been conducted outside the European Union (United States of 
America, and Japan).  The company stated that each of the clinical studies that enrolled subjects in the 
flutemetamol (18F) development programme was conducted in accordance with the current revision of 
the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guideline approved by the ICH, and 
applicable national and local laws and regulations (e.g., Code of Federal Regulations Parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 
and 314).  The clinical trial GE0067-014 carried out outside the European Union (Japan) meets the ethical 
requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
To assist screening and dementia assessment, all subjects diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s Disease 
(pAD) were accompanied by a legally acceptable representative. The informed consent form for those 
subjects with pAD was signed both by the subject and the legally acceptable representative. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Flutemetamol F 18 Injection (the drug product) contains the drug substance, flutemetamol (18F) - a small 
lipophilic  new  molecular  entity  based  on  the  amyloid-specific  dye,  Thioflavin  T.  Following  intravenous 
injection, approximately 7% of administered flutemetamol (18F) activity is distributed to the brain. The 
radioactive  half-life  of  18F  (approximately  110  minutes;  1.8  hours)  necessitates  manufacturing, 
purifying, assaying, and delivering a dose of Flutemetamol F 18 injection to the end user within a single 
day.  The  drug  substance  (flutemetamol  (18F))  is  100%  bioavailable  and  hence,  no  absorption, 
bioavailability, and bioequivalence studies have been conducted.  
For diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, clinical pharmacology studies per se are not conducted, because no 
pharmacologic  effects  are  intended  or  observed  owing  to  the  extremely  small  mass  dose  of  the  drug 
substance. Rather, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry are determined in Phase 1 studies, along with 
safety.  In  the  Flutemetamol  F  18  Injection  clinical  development  program,  two  Phase  1  studies  were 
conducted: [ALZ103] in White (Caucasian) healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with probable AD (pAD), 
and [GE067-014] in Japanese HV and patients with pAD (table 9).

Study protocol ALZ103 (EudraCT Number: 2007-000784-19) 
This was a phase 1, single centre, single dose, open-label, non-randomised study to evaluate the safety, 
biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry, and also to optimise the imaging procedure of AH110690 (18F) 
Injection Healthy Volunteers (HV) and Subjects with Probable Alzheimer’s disease (pAD). The study was 
conducted in a single European study centre: Leuven University Hospital, Belgium between October 24th, 
2007-March 05th, 2008. 
For study ALZ103, 22 subjects 14 HVs and 8 subjects with pAD) received Flutemetamol (18F) solution for 
injection and completed the study (no randomization was performed). One subject was withdrawn prior 
to dosing due to technical problems and was replaced. No withdrawals occurred after administration of 
the IMP.

Study protocol GE-067-014 
This was a phase 1, single centre, single dose, open-label, non-randomised study to evaluate the safety, 
biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry, and also to optimise the imaging protocol of Flutemetamol (18F) 
Injection in Japanese Healthy Volunteers (HV) and Subjects with Probable Alzheimer’s disease (pAD). The 
study was conducted at 2 centers in Japan: Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation (IBRI) and 
Kobe University between February 21st, 2011-October 11th, 2011.  
For study GE067-014, 22 subjects (14 HVs and 8 subjects with pAD) received Flutemetamol F 18 injection 
and completed the study. All demographic and baseline characteristics data have been submitted for all 
studies. 
The Applicant has stated that trials have been conducted in compliance with GCP requirements.  
There was one non-substantial protocol amendment for study ALZ103 (the blood sampling time points 
were modified to ensure suitable samples for kinetic modelling purposes) and none for study GE067-014. 
The protocol amendment does not seem to impact on the validity of the studies.  
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  considered  to  be  acceptable  and  the  study  populations  are 
considered acceptable with regards to demographic characteristics. 
The  number  of  planned  subjects  was  considered  sufficient  to  determine  estimates  of  biodistribution 
parameters. 
The study designs and arterial blood, plasma and urine samples collection were acceptable. 
There were some protocol deviations that did not affect the safety or efficacy populations. None of the 
prior/concomitant medications affected entry into the study or affected study results and were submitted.

Whole Blood and Plasma 
The mean maximum 18F activity concentrations in whole blood and plasma were 2.27×10-5 ml-1 (range: 
1.30×10-5  ml-1  to  4.37×10-5  ml-1)  and  2.45×10-5  ml-1  (range:  1.56×10-5  ml-1  to  3.73×10-5  ml-1), 
respectively. 
The volume of distribution of 18F was estimated by extrapolating the 18F activity concentration in plasma 
curve to time 0. The mean value was 3720 mL (range: 2300 mL to 4850 mL) 
Liver, Gallbladder and Gastrointestinal Tract Contents 
The 18F activity data provided had a significant non-zero amount of 18F activity present in the GI tract 
contents (up to about 10%) at very early time points of 2 to 4 minutes p.i. for each subject. This was 
considered physiologically unlikely for an intravenously administered radiopharmaceutical which would 
enter the GI tract almost exclusively through hepatobiliary transport. Such a reported rapid uptake of 18F 
activity in the contents was also inconsistent with reported measured gallbladder biphasic emptying rates 
in 12 healthy adult volunteers of 0.015 min-1 initially and later at 0.005 min-1 (Lawson et al. 1983).  
In each subject, the 18F activity in the liver grew to a maximum and then decreased exponentially. The 
mean maximum measured 18F activity in the liver was 25.7% (range: 23.7% to 27.2%); the mean time 
of when this maximum occurred was 0.51 h p.i. (range: 0.20 h p.i. to 1.17 h p.i.). The mean half-life of 
the washout phase was 2.0 h (range: 0.8 h to 3.0 h). 
Excluding  the  remaining  tissues  category,  the  three  organs  or  tissues  with  the  highest  normalised 
cumulated activities amongst the 6 subjects were the contents of the small intestine,  with a mean of 
0.429  MBq•h/MBq  (range:  0.328  MBq•h/MBq  to  0.723  MBq•h/MBq);  the  liver  with  a  mean  of  0.399 
MBq•h/MBq  (range:  0.335  MBq•h/MBq  h  to  0.448  MBq•h/MBq);  and,  the  combined  contents  of  the 
urinary  bladder  and  voided  urine,  calculated  for  a  3.5-hour  voiding  interval,  with  a  mean  of  0.287 
MBq•h/MBq (range: 0.154 MBq•h/MBq to 0.453 MBq•h/MBq). 
Internal Radiation Dosimetry 
The organs/tissues receiving the three highest absorbed doses are the gallbladder wall (mean: 0.287 
mGy/MBq;  range:  0.035  mGy/MBq  to  0.727  mGy/MBq),  the  urinary  bladder  wall  (mean:  0.145 
mGy/MBq; range: 0.082 mGy/MBq to 0.225 mGy/MBq) and the wall of the upper large intestine (mean: 
0.117 mGy/MBq; range: 0.096 mGy/MBq to 0.186 mGy/MBq). For all three tissues, the absorbed dose 
was primarily (over 60%) due to the stopping of positrons. 
Effective Dose 
The Effective Doses per unit administered activity for the 6 subjects is presented. The mean value was 
0.032 mSv/MBq (range: 0.026 mSv/MBq to 0.045 mSv/MBq.

Kinetic Modelling  
None of the input function-based modelling methods were able to give consistent discrimination between 
HV and subjects with probable AD in terms of total volume of distribution and binding potential in the 
cortical regions.  
Reference region-based modelling presented URs and DVRs with good discrimination between HV and 
subjects with probable AD in the cortical regions and striatum. 
From  the  Step  2  analysis,  it  was  recommended  that  the  PET  scan  time  window  for  Step  3  should  be 
80-140  minutes  (with  an  option  of  continuing  imaging  up  to  170  minutes)  post-injection  and  the 
recommended method of Step 3 PET data analysis would be reference-ratio modelling using cerebellum 
cortex as reference region.

Normalised Absorbed Doses to Organs and Tissues and Normalized Effective Dose 
The 3 critical organs / tissues with the highest mean absorbed doses were the urinary bladder wall with 
0.114 mGy/MBq (range: 0.0823 mGy/MBq to 0.152 mGy/MBq), kidneys with 0.0751 mGy/MBq (range: 
0.044 mGy/MBq to 0.125 mGy/MBq) and liver with 0.0687 mGy/MBq (range: 0.0452 mGy/MBq to 0.107 
mGy/MBq). For the example of a 185 MBq administered activity, the mean absorbed doses to the urinary 
bladder wall, kidneys and liver are 21 mGy, 13.9 mGy and 12.7 mGy, respectively. 
The  mean  total  body  normalised  absorbed  dose  was  0.0118  mGy/MBq  (0.0112  mGy/MBq  to  0.0133 
mGy/MBq). 
The  mean  normalised  effective  dose  was  0.0255  mSv/MBq  (range:  0.0226  mSv/MBq  to  0.0301 
mSv/MBq). For the example of a 185 MBq administered activity, the mean effective dose is 4.7 mSv. 
Elimination 
•  Excretion 
The  data  from  the  studies  show  that  following  intravenous  injection,  mean  half-life  of  elimination  of 
activity was 4.5 hours. Extent of excretion ranged from 71% to 100%, with a mean of 89%. By pathway, 
the mean extent of excretion was 37% renal (range, 28% to 45%) and 52% hepatobiliary (range, 40% 
to 65%). 
•  Metabolism 
In vitro 
The two major and one minor radiolabelled metabolite were identified in vitro stability, all less lipophilic 
than the parent compound. The major in vitro metabolite observed following incubation of flutemetamol 
in hepatic S9 (from mouse, dog and man, and from Aroclor 1254 induced rat) was the N-demethylation 
product.  No  metabolism  was  observed  in  control  heat  inactivated  or  β-NADPH  deficient  hepatic  S9 
fractions. This is a preliminary indication that metabolism in the human is similar to that of the rat and 
dog, and gives support for these two species being appropriate for use in nonclinical safety studies. 
In Vivo 
In  addition,  after  injection  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  in  the  clinical  ALZ103  Phase  1  trial,  human  plasma 
samples from the subjects were analysed by HPLC. These samples were primarily taken to assist with 
brain kinetic modelling but they also showed that metabolism of the injected flutemetamol (18F) occurred 
rapidly and at least 2 hydrophilic metabolites were detected.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
N/A 
Special populations 
The lack of special populations studies is considered acceptable as only tracer quantities of flutemetamol 
were administered. Studies ALZ-103 and GE067-014 indicated the biodistribution and dosimetry to be 
comparable in Caucasian and Japanese population. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical drug interaction studies were performed as the target of flutemetamol binding (amyloid β) is 
not  a  target  for  concomitant  therapies.  This  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  since  because  of  the 
microgram quantities of flutemetamol in the formulation, no drug-drug interactions are expected. A rat 
drug interaction study performed to assess the effect of an anti-amyloid therapy on the pharmacokinetics 
of flutemetamol (18F) demonstrated no impact of the therapy.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Flutemetamol (18F) is intended as an in vivo tracer of Aß neuritic plaques in the brain.  The fluorine (18F) 
isotope produces positrons that combine with electrons to form gamma rays that are emitted from the 
patient and detected by a PET scanner.   
The  binding  target(s)  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  has  not  been  clearly  elucidated  in  vivo  either  in  normal 
subjects or in targeted patients.  In the pivotal study GE067-007 in end-of-life patients, whose cognitive 
impairment status was not determined, correlation between the in vivo flutemetamol (18F) quantitative 
uptake in cortical grey matter and the total β-amyloid burden averaged from  eight particular cortical 
regions using 4G8 anti-amyloid antibody (that stains β-amyloid found in both neuritic and diffuse plaques) 
was evaluated.  The quantitative PET-autopsy correlation was not significant as analyzed according to the 
protocol;  however,  a  different  statistical  approach  determined  the  correlation  to  be  significant.      The 
company  acknowledged  that  in  four  cases  in  the  autopsy  study  VIZAMYL  positivity  was  observed  in 
subjects  that  were  close  to  the  positive  threshold  for  neuritic  plaques  and/or  had  significant  fibrillar 
amyloid deposits (in diffuse plaques and/or vascular amyloidopathy), indicating that significant fibrillar 
amyloid-beta  deposits  other  than  neuritic  plaques  may  contribute  to  the  VIZAMYL  signal.    A  work 
[GE-067 Amyloid Phasing White Paper] that encompasses a description of PET positivity in structures 
with reference to the type of amyloid deposit, namely neuritic and diffuse, in the subject cohort of the 68 
cases included in the efficacy analysis of the GE067-007 Phase III clinical trial has been provided.  All PET 
images  were  negative  in  the  17  cases  with  phase  0,  1  or  2  of  the  2012  revision  to  the  pathological 
diagnosis of AD (Hyman et al, 2012). As amyloid appears in the striatum in phase 3, some phase 3 cases 
may have associated PET images that are positive in the striatum; this occurred in 1 out of 9 cases. In 
phases 4 and 5, significant amyloid would be expected in the striatum, and 36 of 42 (85%) were positive 
in the striatum in the read without CT while there was 39 out of 42 (93%) in the read with CT.  The 
majority of deposits in the striatum were found to be in the form of diffuse plaques. In 8 cases, frequent 
diffuse plaques in the absence of any neuritic plaques were considered positive by PET, demonstrating 
that flutemetamol (18F) can detect diffuse plaques when they are frequent.  
Flutemetamol (18F) binds non-specifically to cerebral white matter both in normal and targeted patients, 
which has been attributed to solubility of flutemetamol in the lipid content of brain tissues.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Flutemetamol (18F) is administered in doses no higher than 20 µg and does not have any detectable 
pharmacological activity.  No clinical data on secondary pharmacology are available. 
Brain  uptake  and  distribution  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  was  not  evaluated  in  a  specific  study  aimed  to 
evaluate pharmacodynamics but in steps 2 and 3 of two similar PK studies (study ALZ103 and GE067-014 
in European and Japanese population, respectively).  Additionally, quantitative measures of flutemetamol 
(18F) brain activity (SUVR) to discriminate subjects with pAD and HVs, and pAD and aMCI subjects are 
reported in study ALZ201. 
STUDY ALZ103 (Caucasian population) 
The company considered cerebellum cortex as a suitable reference region in Step 3 and future studies. 
Uptake ratios (URs) using the cerebellum as reference were calculated and compared for flutemetamol 
(18F) in 3 HVs and 3 subjects with pAD.  Subjects were administered with 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F). 
URs  were  30-40%  higher  and  DVRs  were  20-30%  higher  in  subjects  with  pAD  in  the  60-185  minute 
interval.  The recommended PET scan time window for Step 3 was defined as 80-140 min (optionally -170 
min) post injection.   
Step 3 aimed secondarily to optimise the imaging procedure, i.e., investigating how scanning start time 
and scan duration affected discrimination between subjects with AD and HV. Five subjects with pAD and 
5 HVs were recruited. Subjects were administered with 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F). Image acquisition 
commenced at 80 minutes post-injection and the scanning window was 80-140 minutes post-injection 
with 140-170 min post-injection as optional.  
To maximise the data available for the analysis, Step 2 and Step 3 data were merged into a common time 
frame. Analysis of the results showed that different scan leongths (5 to 40 minutes) had a negligible effect 
on discrimination between subjects with pAD and HVs.  The same analysis of the effect of different start 
times also showed a very small difference, but with a minor improvement in discrimination for later scan 
start times.  When comparing URs in subjects with pAD (n=8) and HVs (n=8) for the 85-105 minute time 
window [150-170 minute time window], significant test results (i.e., p-values <0.05) were obtained in all 
brain areas except the anterior cingulate cortex, pons and subcortical white matter (Table 10 below). 
When  flutemetamol  (18F)  URs  were  examined  for  individual  subjects,  6  out  of  8  subjects  with  pAD 
showed  clear,  elevated  URs  in  the  cortex  when  compared  to  HVs.    However,  2 subjects  with  pAD 
[MAI1]demonstrated  URs  in  several  brain  areas  which  overlapped  with  the  range  of  URs  seen  in  HVs.  
Seven out of 8 HVs showed a consistently low cortical uptake.  However, 1 HV demonstrated high URs in 
several brain areas which overlapped with the range of URs seen in subjects with pAD.

Based on this analysis, the recommended parameters for a Phase 2 study were: dose approximately 185 
MBq,  scanning  start  time  approximately  90  minutes  post  injection,  scan  duration  approximately  30 
minutes and data acquisition in 5-minute bins. 
STUDY GE067-014 (Japanese population) 
SUVRs were calculated for flutemetamol (18F) in Step 2 and Step 3 HVs and subjects with pAD.  
The data show a temporal window (approximately 75 to 135 minutes) during which SUVR values for HVs 
and the pAD subjects are statistically significantly different in many brain regions (all examined areas of 
the brain except the pons and medial temporal cortex). When flutemetamol (18F) SUVRs were examined 
for individual subjects, 5 of 8 subjects with pAD showed clear, elevated SUVRs in the composite cortex 
when compared to HVs.  In these 5 pAD cases the raised cortical SUVR values are likely to reflect in the 
presence of fibrillar β-amyloid.  The other 3 subjects with pAD (subjects[MAI2]from the step 3 cohort) had 
images consistent with those of the HV cohort and did not have imaging evidence of amyloid deposition 
to explain their cognitive difficulties. All 8 HVs showed a consistently low cortical uptake.  
STUDY ALZ201 
There was significant discrimination in quantitative PET values between subjects with pAD and HVs in all 
regions of the cortex and striatal regions. Overall, there was less discrimination between subjects with 
pAD and aMCI; however, the aMCI quantitative PET values had a bimodal distribution being raised or 
normal.  There  was  a  higher  mean  quantitative  PET  value  in  subjects  with  pAD  in  all  cortical  regions 
investigated compared with aMCI. Similar findings were noted in quantitative PET value discrimination in 
the  cortex  and  striatal  regions  following  [11C]PiB  administration  comparing  pAD  subjects  to  aMCI 
subjects.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
• 
No in vivo pharmacodynamics drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with a number of drugs 
belonging to classes that may be frequently used by elderly patients.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
No clinical studies investigating bioavailability were conducted. Flutemetamol (18F) is administered via 
intravenous injection and is therefore fully bioavailable. 
The characteristics of this agent are the rapidity with which it is taken up by the brain, the amount of 18F 
activity present in the brain and the subsequent washout of 18F activity from background (normal) tissue. 
The 18F activity uptake by the brain was demonstrated to be rapid and substantial, with rapid washout 
having already begun prior to the first imaging time point. 
Following intravenous injection of the recommended dose of 185 MBq of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection in 
humans  approximately  7%  of  administered  flutemetamol  (18F)  activities  distributed  to  the  brain  and 
approximately 25% of the active compound, [18F]flutemetamol, remains in the circulation 20 minutes 
post-injection and approximately 10% at 180 minutes.  
The brain wash out of the compound starts to be linear after approximately 80 minutes post injection. An 
imaging window which begins after 80 minutes post-injection shows low and nearly constant levels of 
uptake in the cortex of healthy volunteers and in the cerebellar cortex for both HV and AD subjects. To 
give some margin to the 80 to 85 minutes post-injection starting point, the recommendation is to acquire 
a 20-minute PET scan starting 90 minutes post-injection. This recommendation is acceptable. 
When comparing uptake ratios in subjects with probable AD and HV for the 85-105 minute time window 
[150-170 minute time window], significant test results (i.e., p-values <0.05) were obtained in all brain 
areas except the anterior cingulate cortex, pons, and subcortical white matter [pons and subcortical white 
matter]. The results of this statistical comparison support the observation that subjects with probable AD 
and HV could be differentiated by flutemetamol (18F). 
The source organ radiation doses were the highest to the hepatobiliary excretion pathways including the 
gall bladder, the small intestine, and upper large intestine of the gastrointestinal tract and also to the 
kidneys and urinary bladder for urinary excretion. The highest absorbed dose values were: gallbladder 
wall  (0.287  mGy/MBq),  the  urinary  bladder  wall  (0.145  μGy/MBq)  and  the  upper  lower  intestine  wall 
(0.117 mGy/MBq). These absorbed dose values reflect the high percentage of administered 18F activity 
that is excreted through the GI tract. 
After injection of an activity of100 MBq, the mean effective dose (i.e., the sum of risk-weighted organ 
absorbed  radiation  dose  used  as  a  measure  of  stochastic  radiation  risk)  was  found  to  be  32.4  ±  6.5 
µSv/MBq (which equals 0.033 mSv/MBq). The levels of radiation dose were considered acceptable and 
due  to  the  low  variability  in  the  measured  data  it  was  recommended  that  the  injected  activity  for 
subsequent studies could be increased to 185 MBq, corresponding to an Effective dose of 5.9 mSv for the 
PET scans for each subject to obtain acceptable image quality on the PET camera used in the study. 
In  several  subjects,  the  transport  of  18F  activity  from  the  liver  to  the  gallbladder  was  delayed,  not 
appearing  until  about  at  least  30  minutes  p.i.,  reflecting  normal  biliary  transport;  in  the  remaining 
subject, there was virtually no 18F activity present in the gallbladder contents and the combined rapidity 
of liver washout and appearance in the GI tract contents reflects the very rapid transfer of 18F activity 
from the liver into the gut.

Excretion was predominantly through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The 18F activity excreted through the 
GI tract was estimated to be 51.7% (± 9.0%). The organ with the highest initial uptake of 18F was the 
liver at about 20-25% of the administered activity. The organs with the highest cumulated activities were 
the contents of the small intestine (0.43 ± 0.15 MBq·h/MBq) and the liver (0.40 ± 0.05 MBq·h/MBq). This 
reflects the large fraction of 18F activity excreted through the GI tract. 
The amount of 18F activity excreted through the urinary pathway was estimated to be 37.3% (± 7.2%). 
The highest initial uptake of 18F was in the combined contents of the urinary bladder and voided urine 
(0.29 ± 0.10 MBq·h/Mbq). The apparent elimination half-life is 4.5 hours.   
Elimination  occurs  primarily  by  clearance  through  the  liver  and  excretion  over  the  intestine  which  is 
reflected  by  the  highest  dosimetry  values  found  in  the  liver  and  small  intestine.  Possible  metabolites 
possibly are cleared through the urinary system. 
In vitro metabolism studies suggest that metabolism of flutemetamol in rat, dog and man are similar. 
Additional  in  vivo  metabolism  studies  confirm  rapid  metabolism  of  radiolabelled  flutemetamol  in  the 
periphery, with the presence of two major metabolites that are less lipophilic than the parent compound. 
Two  major  and  one  minor  radiolabelled  metabolite  were  identified,  all  less  lipophilic  than  the  parent 
compound. In the brain flutemetamol (18F) accounted for 97%, 85% and 75% of the total activity at 2, 
20 and 60 min pi respectively, with only two minor metabolites observed. These data compare well with 
analyses of blood samples that were taken during clinical trial ALZ103 and suggests that metabolites in 
the brain are unlikely to affect the kinetic modelling that was performed on Phase I clinical data. 
The metabolism of [18F]AH110690 is fast and was initially faster in AD than in HV subjects, and then the 
trend  was  gradually  reversed  so  that  beyond  20  min,  more  intact  tracer  was  found  in  AD  than  in  HV 
subjects. The variation within the HV and AD groups was quite large at early times but small from 20 min. 
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 18F in plasma in the human demonstrated 
that 18F in circulation at 5 min post-injection (pi) was 6.9% id in the form of the parent flutemetamol (18F) 
(or about 74.9% of all of the 18F present in the circulation) reducing to 0.1% id (or about 1.7% of all of 
the  18F  present  in  the  circulation)  by  the  time  of  recommended  imaging,  90  min  pi.  A  hydrophilic 
metabolite represented 2% id (or about 21.7% of the total  18F activity in the circulation) at 5 min pi, 
increasing to 6.1% id at 90 min (or about 96% of all of the 18F present in the circulation). 
In vitro metabolism studies following the incubation of either 14C-labelled or unlabelled flutemetamol in 
hepatic  S9  fraction  obtained  from  man  suggest  that  the  major  hydrophilic  metabolite  is  the 
N-demethylation product. 
On the basis of these clinical and nonclinical data, there appears to be little likelihood of the hydrophilic 
metabolite  having  any  demonstrable  effect  upon  the  binding  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  and,  hence,  the 
efficacy of the imaging. This is also supported by data demonstrating that at up to 60 min pi, only 0.1% 
id or less of the 18F activity present in the rat brain is in the form of 18F-labelled metabolites. 
Study ALZ103 was done in subjects with probable Alzheimer’s disease. When flutemetamol (18F) uptake 
ratios were examined for individual subjects, most subjects with probable AD (6 out of 8) showed clear, 
elevated  uptake  ratios  in  the  cortex  when  compared  to  healthy  volunteers  whereas  most  healthy 
volunteers (7 out of 8) showed a consistently low cortical uptake.  
Based on the data provided by the Applicant, it is extremely unlikely that hepatic or renal impairment 
would  affect  the  safety,  efficacy,  or  the  radiation  dosimetry  of  [18F]flutemetamol.  The  omission  of 
pharmacokinetics studies in renal or hepatic impairment was considered acceptable.

There  is  no  information,  if  potential  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  evaluated  in  vivo  which  is 
considered to be overall acceptable. 
PHARMACODYNAMICS 
The Applicant provided limited data on pharmacodynamics in this submission. 
Flutemetamol (18F) does not have any detectable pharmacological activity.  
Flutemetamol (18F) is a molecular imaging agent designed for PET imaging of fibrillar β-amyloid in the 
form of neuritic plaques in the human brain.  The correlation of flutemetamol (18F) binding to β-amyloid 
deposition was investigated in in vitro studies.  The binding target(s) of flutemetamol (18F) has not been 
clearly elucidated in vivo either in normal subjects or in targeted patients. In the pivotal study GE067-007 
in end-of-life patients, whose cognitive impairment status was not determined, correlation between the in 
vivo  flutemetamol  (18F)  quantitative  uptake  in  cortical  grey  matter  and  the  total  β-amyloid  burden 
averaged from eight particular cortical regions using 4G8 anti-amyloid antibody (that stains β-amyloid 
found  in  both  neuritic  and  diffuse  plaques)  was  evaluated.    The  PET-autopsy  correlation  was  not 
significant  as  analyzed  according  to  the  protocol;  however,  a  different  statistical  approach  shows  the 
correlation to be significant.    
Flutemetamol  (18F)  binds  non-specifically  to  cerebral  white  matter  both  in  healthy  volunteers  and 
targeted patients, which the company attributes to solubility of flutemetamol in the lipid content of brain 
tissues.   
Brain  uptake  and  distribution  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  was  not  evaluated  in  a  specific  study  aimed  to 
evaluate pharmacodynamics.  In two similar PK studies (study ALZ103 and GE067-014 in European and 
Japanese  population,  respectively)  and  a  phase  2  clinical  study  (ALZ201),  there  were  discrimination 
between  the  quantitative  uptake  values  in  PET  images  obtained  for  pAD  and  HV  subjects  in  most 
examined areas of the brain.   
For Caucasian population (study ALZ103), uptake values of a flutemetamol (18F) PET scan at 80-170 
minutes  post-injection  after  administration  of  185  MBq  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  statistically  differed 
(p-values <0.05) between subjects with pAD (n=8) and HVs (n=8) for the 85-105 minute time window 
[150-170 minute time window], in all 11 defined brain areas except the anterior cingulate cortex, pons 
and  subcortical  white  matter.    The  particular  brain  regions  were  selected  based  on  those  previously 
described  in  post-mortem  studies  to  discriminate  HV  and  AD,  plus  other  cortical  regions  offering  less 
discrimination  but  used  as  reference,  and  regions  with  no  discrimination  capability.  Multiplicity  of 
contrasts was not accounted for in the statistical analysis.  PET uptake values in 6 out of 8 pAD subjects 
were clearly high, and it was low in 7 out of 8 HVs.  However, it is of concern that the uptake values in 2 
pAD subjects overlapped with those of HVs, and the opposite happened to 1 HV.  The detected minimal 
non-specific  binding  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  in  the  cerebellum  cortex  was  considered  as  a  suitable 
reference region. 
It was not possible to make any conclusions regarding the optimal scanning window based on trends in 
the statistical analysis of the data from different scanning windows.  However, based on this study, the 
recommended parameters for a Phase 2 study were: dose approximately 185 MBq, scanning start time 
approximately 90 minutes post injection, scan duration approximately 30 minutes and data acquisition in 
5minute bins. 
Significant discrimination in quantitative PET values between subjects with pAD and HVs in all regions of 
the cortex and striatal regions occurred in phase 2 study ALZ201. Overall, there was less discrimination 
between  subjects  with  pAD  and  aMCI;  however,  the  aMCI  quantitative  PET  values  had  a  bimodal 
distribution, being raised or normal.

No in vivo pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with a number of drugs 
belonging to classes that may be frequently used by elderly patients.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
It was concluded from study ALZ103 that for all cortical regions of the brain, flutemetamol (18F) was able 
to differentiate between subjects with probable AD and HV using uptake ratios.  
As a result of phase 1 studies the recommended parameters for single scanning in a Phase 2 study would 
be: dose approximately 185 MBq (corresponding to an effective radiation dose of 5.9 mSv), the PET scan 
time  window  should  be  80-140  minutes  pi,  scanning  start  time  around  90  minutes  pi,  scan  duration 
around  30  minutes,  and  the  recommended  method  of  PET  data  analysis  would  be  reference-ratio 
modelling using cerebellum cortex as reference region. 
The  following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  derived:  Following  intravenous  injection  of  the 
recommended dose of 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F) in humans, approximately 25% remained in the 
circulation 20 minutes post-injection and approximately 10% at 180 minutes. The apparent elimination 
half-life was 4.5 hours. Elimination was approximately 52% hepatobiliary and 37% renal. Information 
about the identity of metabolites was not provided. The pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment has not been characterised. 
The radiation dosimetry is comparable to approved PET markers like fludeoxyglucose (18F) and is not 
substantially affected by patient weight. The radioactive half-life of (18F) is approximately 110 minutes, 
the biological half-life of flutemetamol (18F) in humans is 4.5 hours.  
Flutemetamol  (18F)  is  administered  in  mass  doses  not  higher  than  60  µg  and  does  not  have  any 
detectable  pharmacological  activity.  Flutemetamol  (18F)  undergoes  radioactive  decay  releasing  a 
positron which then interacts with a neighbouring electron resulting in the release of two 511-keV gamma 
rays which can be detected with PET scanners. 
PET images after administration of flutemetamol (18F) allowed differentiation between pAD subjects and 
HVs. Using as the standard of truth each subject’s baseline diagnosis, the majority (defined as agreement 
between  at  least  3  of  5  blinded  image  evaluators)  blinded  visual  assessment  of  flutemetamol  (18F) 
images showed a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 96%. There was a very good agreement between 
quantitation and visual assessment.  
PHARMACODYNAMICS 
It was confirmed in vitro that flutemetamol (18F) binds to β-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain, with 
negligible binding to neurofibrillary tangles. The in vivo binding of flutemetamol (18F) to other β-amyloid 
structures or other brain structures or receptors remains unknown. 
There is discrimination between pAD and HVs by using quantitative uptake values of flutemetamol (18F) 
PET scan in some brain regions in phase 1 and 2 studies; however, values were overlapping in some 
individual  cases.    Overall,  there  was  less  discrimination  between  subjects  with  pAD  and  aMCI.  
Discrimination between pAD and other non-AD dementias was not assessed. 
The quantitative correlation between the in vivo flutemetamol (18F) uptake in cortical grey matter and 
the β-amyloid burden measured by histopathology might be artifacted and is uncertain. 
In conclusion, although the company has not elucidated in vivo how and which of the different types of 
β-amyloid and other relevant structures are traced by flutemetamol (18F) (which would be important in 
the  context  of  the  proposed  indication),  the  correlation  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  binding  to  β-amyloid 
deposition was investigated in vitro and together with the totality of the available PD data was considered 
sufficient to justify the mechanism of action and the intended context of use.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Neither the optimal dose nor the optimal timing for acquisition of flutemetamol (18F) PET images were 
determined by specific studies or adequately justified.  For clinical practice, the company proposed that 
images should be acquired starting 90 minutes after of a single intravenous injection of 185 MBq as a 
bolus over approximately 40 seconds, not based on criteria of efficacy but on the fact that the effective 
dose  (i.e.  the  absorbed  radiation  dose  in  whole-body)  is  within  the  level  of  other  PET 
radiopharmaceuticals approved.  The majority of subjects in the clinical development program, but not 
all, received the recommended dose.   
The  dose  was  determined  in  Phase  1  PK  studies  ALZ103  and  GE067-014  by  an  activity  escalation 
approach: 
•  Study ALZ103 was conducted in 3 steps.  In step 1 recruiting 6 HVs, the first 2 subjects each 
received  100  MBq  dose  of  flutemetamol  (18F).  After  a  review  of  safety  and  internal  radiation 
dosimetry  data  from  these  subjects,  the  dose  was  increased  to  150  MBq  for  the  remaining  4 
subjects. A second review of safety and internal radiation dosimetry data was conducted once all 
6  evaluable  subjects  had  been  completed.  Dosimetry  estimates  in  HVs  determined  that  the 
injected activity for subsequent studies could be increased to 185 MBq. In step 2, 3 pAD subjects 
and 3 additional HVs were each dosed with 185 MBq and no safety concerns were raised.  In step 
3, 10 additional subjects (5 pAD and 5 HV) each received 185 MBq.  Results were used to define 
the imaging procedure for the following studies. 
• 
In  study  GE067-014  a  similar  activity  escalation  methodology  to  that  of  ALZ103  was  used. 
Results were in agreement with the conclusions of ALZ103. 
Therefore, 185 MBq was determined as optimal activity to be administered.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The CHMP considers that, from the data provided by the company to support efficacy, there is a single 
pivotal  study 
to  base 
this  application 
(i.e.  GE067-007). 
  Then,  CPMP/EMA/2330/99, 
CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev  and  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/321180/2008  also  apply.    This  was  a  multicenter, 
single-dose, open-label Phase III study conducted at 15 centers in the United States and 4 centers in the 
UK.

Study GE067-007 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Subjects  aged  55  years  or  older,  who  had  been  diagnosed  with  a  terminal  illness  and  a  short  life 
expectancy (approximately 1 year or less) were included.  Subjects were excluding if having a known or 
suspected  structural  brain  abnormalities,  such  as  infarcts  or  tumors,  which  might  interfere  with  the 
interpretation of PET images. 
Treatments 
Patients underwent screening visit before the administration of flutemetamol (18F), including anatomic 
brain imaging and clinical history.  An anatomic image (MRI/CT) had to be performed within the previous 
12 months before or simultaneously to PET image. 
Each subject received a single i.v. dose of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection between 110 to 370 MBq. PET 
imaging for 30 minutes (or as short as 10 minutes if not possible) was to start approximately 90 minutes 
after the injection.    
Flutemetamol (18F) PET images were visually read (as positive or negative) by 5 independent readers, 
who were previously in-person trained and qualified, and were also blinded to the standard of truth (SoT) 
results and all other information about the subject.  A 10-minute acquisition PET image was interpreted 
using a Sokoloff colour scale.  Five particular brain regions were assessed (frontal lobe/anterior cingulate, 
posterior  cingulate/precuneus,  lateral  temporal  lobe,  insula  and  striatum).    Selection  of  regions  was 
performed to include those investigated in the literature in which the greatest differences exist between 
HVs and subjects with pAD.  The blinded visual image interpretations were carried out first in a session 
where all study images were evaluated without anatomic brain images for reference, and in randomized 
order  for  each  reader.  In  a  second  session  in  the  same  day,  PET  images  were  presented  in  a 
re-randomized order and were re-reviewed, this time with the concomitant or previous subject’s anatomic 
images.  Visual assessment of the flutemetamol (18F) PET scan was completed in three reading sessions 
(including both PET only reads and PET+CT reads) with a minimum number of images in one day of 90 
and the maximum of 178.  PET-only and PET+CT images were read separately but in a similar session. 
The criteria to interpret images were normal or abnormal as follows (see fig 84-3): 
• 
• 
A region is considered as having a normal pattern if the tracer signal in cortical regions is low 
(i.e. distinctly lower signal intensity compared with adjacent white matter and similar in intensity 
to the grey matter-rich regions of the cerebellum).  Signal will not be completely absent in grey 
matter regions of the images, as white matter binding in adjacent regions will bleed into the grey 
matter regions due to PET partial volume resolution effects. 
A region is considered abnormal if the tracer signal in cortical regions appears  high (i.e., 
approximately at the same or higher signal intensity as adjacent white matter and greater than 
the grey matter-rich regions of the cerebellum).

Figure 84-3.  Normal (left) and abnormal (right) flutemetamol (18F) images showing equal cerebellar 
cortex uptake values in both the normal and abnormal scans. The abnormal image shows uptake levels in 
the grey matter which are similar to or greater than the adjacent white matter intensities. The grey matter 
in the normal image is at approximately the same level of intensity as the cerebellar cortex.

An assignation of any of the cortical regions described above as abnormal (elevated grey matter intensity) 
indicated that the image was recorded as abnormal. Otherwise it was recorded as normal. 
PET images were also interpreted quantitatively as SUVRs, using the cerebellum cortex as an optimal 
reference  region, after  being  co-registered  with  the subject’s  anatomic  image,  in  the  8  regions  taken 
post-mortem for amyloid analysis.  The 8 different regions for the quantitative method of flutemetamol 
(18F)  PET  interpretation  were  selected  to  cover  mainly  cortical  regions  with  known  presence  of 
beta-amyloid. 
Pathologic evidence of cortical neuritic plaques based on Bielchowsky silver stain (BSS) was defined as 
the SoT for this study since amendment 1. SoT results were available for those subjects who died during 
the study and underwent brain autopsy. Brain tissue specimens were taken from the following 8 cortical 
regions:  precuneus,  midfrontal  lobe,  superior  and  middle  temporal,  anterior  and  posterior  cingulates, 
inferior  parietal  and  primary  visual  cortex.    A  single  neuropathologist  conducted  postmortem  brain 
assessments, and was blinded to brain PET and anatomic imaging data and results as well as all clinical 
information about the subject.  For each region, a mean regional score of the neuritic plaque density was 
established  by  using  a  modified  Consortium  to  Establish  a  Registry  for  Alzheimer’s  Disease  (CERAD) 
scoring system. Diffuse plaques are not scored for the CERAD criteria as shown hereinafter.  
Each mean regional score was compared to 1.5 and the region was classified as abnormal if the regional 
score exceeded 1.5, otherwise it was classified as normal. A subject was classified as normal only if all 
regions were classified as normal. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the sensitivity of blinded visual interpretations of flutemetamol 
(18F) PET images without anatomic brain images for detecting brain fibrillar amyloid beta. 
Secondary Objectives:  
• 
To determine the specificity of the visual interpretations of flutemetamol (18F) PET images without 
anatomic brain images for detecting brain fibrillar amyloid beta. 
To determine the sensitivity and specificity of blinded visual interpretations of flutemetamol (18F) PET 
images with anatomic brain images using CT for detecting brain fibrillar amyloid beta. 
To determine the level of association between global and regional estimates of brain uptake (standard 
uptake  value  ratio  [SUVR])  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  and  corresponding  estimates  of  brain  fibrillar 
amyloid beta levels made post-mortem. 
Inter-reader and intra-reader agreement 
To determine the sensitivity and specificity of blinded visual interpretations of flutemetamol (18F) PET 
images without anatomic brain images versus the clinical diagnosis.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the sensitivity of the blinded visual interpretation of each subject’s 
Flutemetamol F 18 Injection brain PET image as normal or abnormal, without anatomic brain images for

reference. The success criterion was the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval for 
sensitivity being greater than a priori threshold of 70% for at least 3 of the 5 reader results. 
Secondary endpoints were the specificity of the blinded interpretation without anatomic brain images, 
both sensitivity and specificity of blinded reading with anatomic brain images, the correlation between 
PET uptake and beta-amyloid levels postmortem, and inter- and intra-reader agreement. 
Sample size 
Subjects  were  planned  to  be  followed  until  a  minimum  of  31  evaluable  brains  that  were  positive  for 
fibrillar amyloid beta according to the SoT had been obtained for the primary analysis, as determined by 
an IDMC, which would review the pathology data on an ongoing basis during the study.  
Randomisation 
There was no randomized order to perform both recruitment and the imaging techniques.  PET images 
were  randomized  in  the  reading  sessions,  and  randomization  was  different  between  the  PET-only 
assessment and the subsequent PET-anatomic session. 
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection was performed.  However, certain personnel were blinded to 
specific data as detailed before under “Treatments”  section. Image reviewers  were blinded to subject 
clinical information.  
Statistical methods 
Major changes were performed in the statistical methods during the conduct of the study.  At amendment 
2, the primary statistical analysis was established as to assess confidence intervals of sensitivity for visual 
flutemetamol (18F) PET scan reading without anatomic image computed on an individual reader basis 
(five raters).    The primary efficacy endpoint, the sample size and the visual PET reading were established 
as detailed above.  The stopping rule was also introduced at that time. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the total 203 enrolled subjects, 180 were dosed, 176 completed flutemetamol (18F) PET study, and 69 
died during the study and underwent brain autopsy; the brains from 68 of the subjects who died were 
considered evaluable so these comprised the post-mortem analysis set.

Recruitment 
No data provided. 
Conduct of the study 
The study started 22-Jun-10 and ended 23-Nov-11. 
There were 2 amendments to the original protocol of study GE067-007.  The initial protocol was dated 8 
Feb 2010, Amendment 1 on 30-Dec-10 and Amendment 2 on 15-Sep-11. 
The  most  significant  changes  to  the  protocol  resulting  from  these  amendments  concerned  study 
participants, treatments, objectives, outcomes/endpoints, sample size and statistical methods.   
Baseline data 
In the post-mortem analysis set, mean age was approximately 80 years, and >90% of subjects were ≥65 
years of age. Most subjects were white (94%) and non-Hispanic or Latino (68%). Females comprised 
51%.  
The time from death to autopsy ranged from 1 to 53 hours, with a mean (SD) of 12.3 (9.31) hours and 
median of 10.8 hours.  
From the total, 21 (31%) had no history of cognitive impairment, about 44% had AD, 25% had other 
dementia disorders, and none had MCI. 
The mean dose administered in the post-mortem analysis set was 348.2 MBq (range of 185-388.5). 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 180 subjects dosed, 176 underwent PET imaging and 69 died and underwent brain autopsy; 
however, only 68 were considered evaluable for the standard-of-truth assessment. 
Outcomes and estimation

Note: exact 95% binomial confidence intervals (CI) are presented for sensitivity and are rounded off to the nearest integer. 
*    2-sided 95% confidence interval with a lower bound >70%  
Because the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval for sensitivity was >70% for at 
least 3 of the 5 readers (the predefined criterion for study success), the primary objective of the study 
was met. 
SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES 
*Specificity of Blinded Visual PET Image Interpretation without Anatomic Images 
The specificity of the blinded visual interpretation of PET images without anatomic images ranged from 
44% to 92%. Specificity was ≥80% for 4 of the 5 blinded readers (table 12).

No/sparse  neuritic  (amyloid)  plaques,  per  modified  CERAD  criteria,  based  on  specimens  stained  with  the 
Bielschowsky  silver  stain. 
Specificity = True negatives / (True negatives + False positives); SoT = standard of truth 
Note: exact 2-sided 95% binomial confidence intervals (CI) are presented for specificity and are rounded off to 
the nearest integer. 
There were 8 (11.8%) cases with false negative (FN) results on PET scan by at least 1 reader.  Two of them 
were FN by 1 reader and changed to be true positive (TP) when CT was added.  The remaining 6 cases were 
FN for the majority of readers, all occurred in subjects with an intermediate neuritic plaque density (1 with 
sparse or 5 with moderate, which are the most challenging cases for an autopsy study), all of whom had 
atrophy  evident  on  CT  and  2  became  TP  with  the  addition  of  CT  to  the  PET  image  read.    Those  6 
corresponded to 2 Lewy Body Disease, 2 AD, 1 cerebral amyloid angiopathy and 1 vascular disease.   
Of the 17 (25%) cases with FP results by at least 1 reader, only 2 were FP by the majority interpretation 
(1 with moderate and 1 with sparse modified CERAD, all them had neuropathological evidence of Lewy 
Body Disease).  The applicant explains them likely due to diffuse plaques.  Among the 15 remaining cases, 
13 were FP by one reader (11 associated with reader 3), and 2 were FP by 2 readers.  
*Sensitivity and specificity of the blinded visual interpretation of PET images for detecting brain fibrillar 
amyloid beta with anatomic images ranged from 91% to 98% and from 56% to 92%, respectively. 
Overall, sensitivities of blinded visual PET image interpretations with anatomic images in post-mortem 
analysis set were equal or slightly higher than those of interpretation of PET-only images: 91% (78-97%), 
95%  (84-99%),  98%  (88-100%),  91%  (78-97%)  and  91%  (77-97%)  for  each  independent  reader.  
Overall, specificities of blinded visual PET image interpretations with anatomic images in post-mortem 
analysis  set  were  equal  or  slightly  higher:  92%  (74-99%),  88%  (69-98%),  56%  (35-76%),  88% 
(69-98%) and 92% (74-99%) for each independent reader. 
Comparison  of  the  95%  confidence  intervals  for  sensitivity  obtained  with  anatomic  images  to  those 
obtained without anatomic images shows overlap of the confidence intervals for each of the 5 readers. 
*Inter-reader Agreement and Intra-reader Reproducibility 
For  blinded  visual  interpretations  made  without  anatomic  images,  the  kappa  scores  for  all  pairwise 
comparisons except those involving Reader 3 ranged from 0.76 to 0.91 (without anatomic images) and 
from 0.86 to 0.97 (with anatomic images); values for Reader 3 ranged from 0.44 to 0.55 (without) 0.56 
to 0.64 (with).  The kappa scores of self-agreement for repeated blinded visual interpretations without 
anatomic images ranged from 0.60 to 1.00.  With anatomic images the kappa scores ranged from 0.30 to 
1.00.

Fixed effects from mixed model of immunohistochemical estimates of amyloid level (percent amyloid in tissue specimen) = PET 
measurement of SUVR + region of the brain + time in months from PET scan to death [(date of death – date of PET scan)/30].  
Number of subjects in the model = 30.  Maximum observations per subject = 8.  
With regional SUVR, model fit was good but the slope was not significantly different from 0 with either 
reference region (p = 0.1452 and p = 0.0580), indicating a lack of statistically significant association 
between regional SUVR and pathology results based on 4G8 staining. Brain region was a significant factor 
in both models. Time from PET scan to death was not significant in either model. 
To clarify the contribution of the different regions to this highly significant correlation, a post-hoc analysis 
to assess the correlation between flutemetamol (18F) and amyloid pathology for each of the 8 regions 
included in the study independently was performed. As seen in Table 14 and Table 15, this new analysis 
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  correlation  in  each  of  the  8  regions  (p-value  <0.001);  it  also 
showed that, for all 8 regions, the variation in SUVR explained 61% or more of the variation in amyloid

Ancillary analyses 
The  positive  predictive  value  (PPV)  and  the  negative  predictive  value  (NPV)  of  the  blinded  visual 
interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET scan were  calculated.  PPV without anatomic images ranged 
from 74% to 95% by reader, with a median of 92% and a majority value of 95%. NPV without anatomic 
images ranged from 73% to 87% by reader, with a median of 82% and a majority value of 79%, and with 
all five blinded readers having lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals extending below 70% (range 
49% to 66%). 
Results of sensitivity and specificity of blinded visual PET image interpretations without anatomic images 
in the pivotal study using a majority read of five readers for estimation of beta amyloid deposition were 
86% (95% CI: 72% to 95%), and 92% (95% CI: 74% to 99%), respectively. 
With respect to neuropathological diagnosis (identifying/excluding AD) according to NIA-Reagan criteria, 
the  blinded  visual  interpretation  of flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  images  without  anatomic  images  had  the 
following performance metrics:

Analysis 
Primary Analyses 
description 
Analysis 
From 176 subjects who underwent PET imaging, those 68 who died and underwent 
population  
evaluable brain autopsy (with clinical diagnosis as probable 30 AD subjects, 17 had other 
dementia disorders, none had MCI and 21 had no history of cognitive impairment), were 
included in the postmortem analysis set.   
Descriptive 
Statistical analysis:  
statistics  
Primary analysis was assessing confidence intervals of sensitivity for visual flutemetamol 
(18F) PET scan reading computed on an individual reader basis (five raters).  
Participant flow:  
A total of 203 subjects were screened for the study.  The study included 180 subjects that 
were assigned to receive treatment. The primary objective of this study required 
postmortem brain specimens. A total of 69 subjects died, only 68 brains were available 
for efficacy analyses, and the brain from 1 of the remaining 68 subjects was not 
evaluable. Efficacy was assessed in the post-mortem autopsy set consisting of 42 
amyloid-positive cases in 67 autopsied cases (observers 2 and 4) or 43 cases 
amyloid-positive cases in 68 autopsied cases (observers 1, 3, and 5). There were some 
protocol deviations.

Analysis 
For Secondary analyses see clinical assessment section 
description 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
The company presented pooled analyses of efficacy of the 11 studies composing the flutemetamol (18F) 
clinical development program. No meta-analysis was presented. 
The pooling strategy for analyses each used 1 of 5 levels of data integration based on the type of training 
of the blinded image readers (in-person or electronic medium), the SoT (or bases of comparison of the 
PET image), and populations for analysis.  Integration levels 1 through 3 were based on data resulting 
from  in-person  training  of  blinded  image  readers;  levels  4  and  5  were  based  on  data  resulting  from 
blinded reader training using an electronic program (Study GE067-021). 
The primary analysis for efficacy was based on the Level 1 integration of data from subjects with known 
(or presumed) brain β-amyloid status (normal or abnormal) including those at the end of life and young 
(≤40 years of age) cognitively intact volunteers in whom brain amyloid is known to be extremely rare.   
The effect of age, gender, race and medications used for treatment of AD symptoms on the efficacy of 
Flutemetamol F 18 Injection was analysed.  Results show that these covariables generally did not affect 
the efficacy of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection. 
SUPPORTIVE STUDIES 
Study GE067-015 
This was a multi-center, open-label phase 3 study to determine the overall specificity of Flutemetamol F 
18 Injection for excluding the presence of brain amyloid based on the visual assessment of a PET scan by 
5 independent blinded readers (previously in-person trained in PET scan reading) reviewing images from 
a population of healthy young adult subjects aged 18 to 40 (presumed to be amyloid negative). 
The study was prematurely stopped after reassessment of sample size which changed from 300 HVs in 
the original protocol to be up to 300 after amendment 2.  When the study was prematurely stopped, 181 
subjects had been dosed with 185 MBq of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection, and completed the study.    All 
scans  from  this  study  were  blindly  and  randomly  mixed  with  approximately  equal  numbers  of 
flutemetamol  (18F)  scans  from  the  GE-067-005  aMCI  study  (which  was  expected  to  contain  some 
abnormal images) to avoid potential bias if readers saw only (or predominantly) normal scans.  
The primary objective (i.e. at least 3 of 5 blinded readers demonstrated specificity with a lower bound of 
the  95%  confidence  interval  that  exceeded  80%)  was  achieved.    The  results  of  blinded  reads  by  5 
independent readers showed specificity of 100%, 68%, 99%, 99% and 99%.  The lower bounds of the 
95%  confidence  intervals  for  specificity  for  the  5  readers  were  98%,  61%,  97%,  97%  and  96%, 
exceeding 95% for 4 of the 5 readers 
The between-reader agreement was >99% for all comparisons except those including Reader 2 (with 
agreement rates of 68-69%). The within-reader reproducibility in a 10% random sample of images from 
the full dataset was 100% for Readers 1, 3, 4 and 5 and 75% for Reader 2.

Study GE067-008, GE067-009, GE067-010 and GE067-011 
These  were  four  Phase  3,  open-label,  non-randomized  single  center  (-008  and  -010)  or  multi-centre 
(-009 and -011) biopsy studies.  They primarily aimed to assess the level of association between brain 
uptake of flutemetamol (18F) (as estimated by SUVR) and the level of amyloid (as estimated by IHC with 
4G8  or  NAB228)  in  the  biopsy  samples  taken  from  the  cortex  of  patients  with  normal  pressure 
hydrocephalus  (NPH)  while  undergoing  shunt  placement  (study  GE067-008,  -009,  -011)  or  during 
intracranial pressure measurement (study GE067-010 and -011). 
In the “retrospective” studies (GE067-008 with n=7 and GE067-010 with n=15), subjects had previously 
had front lobe cortical biopsy for detection and quantification of amyloid so PET imaging was performed 
after biopsy.  In the “prospective” studies (GE067-009 with n=12 and GE067-011 with n=18), subjects 
were scheduled for shunt placement surgery and PET imaging was performed prospectively before shunt 
placement and brain biopsy.  Comparisons between SUVR and biopsy estimates were performed for either 
contralateral to the biopsy site (retrospective studies, in  which biopsy preceded imaging) or from the 
biopsy site (prospective studies, in which biopsy followed imaging). 
Subjects underwent PET imaging of the brain for 30 minutes starting approximately 90 minutes after 
receiving 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F) intravenously.   
In study GE067-008, a regression model confirmed a high level of direct association between SUVR-CER 
(i.e., based on the cerebellum as the reference region and the NAB228 IHC estimate of amyloid β level.  
The full model was significant (R2 =0.834, p = 0.027), as was the model factor for SUVR (slope = 0.631, 
p = 0.011).  The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.799 (p = 0.0174), 0.858 (p <0.0001) and 0.669 
(p = 0.0064) for studies GE067-009, GE067-010 and GE067-011, respectively. 
Study ALZ201 
This  was  a  multi-center,  open-label,  non-randomised,  phase  2  study  primarily  aimed  to  examine  the 
efficacy of visual assessment of raised flutemetamol (18F) brain uptake for separating subjects with pAD 
from  healthy  volunteers  (HVs)  and  to  determine  the  proportions  of  aMCI  subjects  with  normal  and 
abnormal flutemetamol (18F) images. 
Quantitative analysis of PET images were also performed and compared for the three recruited subgroups. 
Image quality and reproducibility were also assessed.  Test-retest variability was assessed in a subgroup 
of patients with pAD.  The study also assessed the correlation between flutemetamol (18F) and [11C]PiB 
in some of the recruited patients with clinical AD and all the amCI.   
All subjects received a single i.v. dose of 185 MBq of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection, except 5 subjects with 
pAD who received 2 administrations of approximately 120 MBq each. 
There were 70 evaluable subjects: 25 with pAD (based on NINCDS-ADRDA),  20 with aMCI (based on 
Petersen criteria), and 25 HVs [10 young HVs and 15 older HVs].  During blinded visual assessment of 
flutemetamol (18F) images by 5 independent readers previously in-person trained, overall all readers 
reported a greater percentage of pAD subjects (92%) to have raised amyloid beta levels compared to 
aMCI patients (45%) and HVs (4%) based on the the subject’s clinical diagnosis at study entry.

Measures of efficacy were visual assessment as normal or abnormal for each subject and were used to 
estimate sensitivity for pAD subjects, specificity for  HV  subjects, and assign aMCI subjects to pAD or 
HV.There was significant discrimination in quantitative PET values between subjects with pAD and HVs in 
all regions of the cortex and striatal regions. Overall, there was less discrimination between subjects with 
pAD and aMCI; however, the aMCI quantitative PET values had a bimodal distribution being raised or 
normal.  There  was  a  higher  mean  quantitative  PET  value  in  subjects  with  pAD  in  all  cortical  regions 
investigated compared with aMCI. Similar findings were noted in quantitative PET value discrimination in 
the  cortex  and  striatal  regions  following  [11C]PiB  administration  comparing  pAD  subjects  to  aMCI 
subjects.  
There  was  significant  correlation  (r2=0.82)  between  quantitative  PET  uptake  values  generated  from 
flutemetamol (18F) and [11C]PiB PET scans in 20 subjects with pAD and 20 with aMCI who also received 
an i.v. dose of [11C]PiB not exceeding 370 MBq on the same day or within approximately 30 days after 
receiving Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.    
PET  readers  rated  the  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  image  quality  of  subjects  with  pAD  as  excellent  in  21 
(84%) and good in 4 (16%) subjects, respectively. In all aMCI subjects and HVs, the images were rated 
as excellent. Following administration of a second dose of 120 MBq of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection in 5 
with pAD (who had also received 120 MBq as the first dose), the images were rated as good in all subjects 
(100%). 
Cortical flutemetamol (18F) test-retest quantitative PET estimates had a low inter-subject variability of 
1-4% in pAD subjects. The variability was lowest in the occipital cortex, striatum, POC, and the frontal 
cortex and was highest in the medial temporal cortex, subcortical white matter, and pons.   The mean 
test-retest variability of all subjects and regions for quantitative flutemetamol (18F) PET estimates was 
excellent. 
Between-Reader  Agreement  showed  a  Fleiss  kappa  score  of  0.96  by  the  5  readers  in  70  of  74 
flutemetamol (18F) images read interpreted visually. In the other 4 images, there was agreement by 4 
out of 5 readers.  
Reassessment  of  the  clinical  diagnosis  in  67  returning  subjects  at  a  2-year  follow-up  (all  baseline 
recruited patients except for 3 in the pAD group and 1 each in the aMCI and HV groups) was performed 
to evaluate the relationship between baseline flutemetamol (18F) PET imaging and changes in diagnostic 
status within 24 months. There were no changes from the initial diagnosis for any of the returning pAD 
subjects (n = 22) or HVs (n = 24). Of the returning subjects who had initially been diagnosed with aMCI 
(n  =  19),  9  (47%)  were  diagnosed  to  have  pAD  at  the  2-year  follow-up;  7  of  these  had  raised 
flutemetamol (18F) uptake at baseline. The other 10 (53%), eight of whom had negative flutemetamol 
PET scans, retained at the 2-year follow-up a baseline diagnosis of aMCI.

As calculated by the CHMP assessors, sensitivity of the visual PET scan reading (including 95% CI) to 
show the aMCI conversion rate from baseline to clinically probable AD at 2-year follow-up in 9 converters 
was  77.8%  (95%CI:  40.0%-97.2%),  specificity  in  10  non-converters  was  80.0%  (95%CI: 
44.4%-97.5%), positive likelihood ratio was 3.89 (95% CI: 1.07-14.10) and negative likelihood ratio was 
0.28  (95%  CI:  0.08-0.98).  The  design  of  this  study  did  not  allow  for  estimating  the  risk  of  MCI 
progression to clinical AD.

Study GE067-005 
This was a multi-center, open-label, non-randomised, phase 3 study.  This study was primarily aimed to 
compare the time to conversion to probable AD in aMCI subjects with normal and abnormal patterns of 
flutemetamol (18F) uptake based on the visual assessment of a PET scan by five independent blinded 
readers previously in-person trained.  The original protocol was amended five times, and the data below 
corresponds  to  final  protocol  after  amendment  5.    Patients  received  a  single  dose  of  185  MBq  of 
flutemetamol (18F). The pre-planned primary analysis was a time-to-event analysis (Cox proportional 
hazards).  
At  the  time  of  the  initial  submission,  it  was  an  ongoing  study  and only  inter-reader  and  intra-reader 
reproducibility of visual assessment of the individual flutemetamol PET images were reported with regard 
to efficacy (safety was also reported).  Recruitment had already been completed at that time, with a total 
of  232  subjects  with  amnestic  MCI  (Petersen  criteria)  included,  and  the  study  was  pending  of  the 
follow-up  period  to  be  concluded.    All  subjects  subsequently  attended  follow-up  visits  to  determine 
whether or not conversion to probable AD had occurred. Each subject was to be assessed by the site 
every 6 months until they convert to AD, or, if they did not convert, until either 3 years had elapsed from 
imaging or the required number of conversions was reached (whichever occurred later). The follow-up 
time period for non-converters was amended two times.   
The CHMP required that the applicant provide the results of study GE067-005 concerning the conversion 
rate  from  aMCI  to  pAD.    However,  to  avoid  breaking  the  blind  before  completion  of  the  36-month 
follow-up, the company provided an ad hoc analysis with the percentage of aMCI patients with positive 
flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  scans  and  rates  of  conversion  from  aMCI  to  clinical  probable  AD  (pAD)  as  a 
function of flutemetamol (18F) scan status (positive/negative) for a random sample of 70 (30%) of the 
232 subjects in the GE067-005 study.  The mean duration of follow-up was 27.1 months (range, 4 to 40; 
median, 32.4; SD 10.6), derived as time from last dose to date of completion/withdrawal for subjects who 
completed or withdrew and time from last dose to data cut-off date (15 July 2013) for subjects who were 
continuing.  
After completion of the 36-month follow-up period, the applicant provided the full study results.  In this 
study, from the 232 patients clinically diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and were followed 
for  36  months  to  evaluate  the  relationship  between  flutemetamol  (18F)  imaging  and  changes  in 
diagnostic  status  98  (42 %)  had  abnormal  (positive)  flutemetamol  (18F)  scans.  Of  the  232  patients 
enrolled, 224 had at least one post-scan review by the independent committee and were included in the 
analysis. At the 36-month follow-up, 81 (36 %) converted to clinical AD. Of the 97 MCI subjects who had 
a  positive  PET  scan  and  at  least one  committee  assessment,  52  (53.6 %)  were  classified  clinically  as 
converted to clinical AD after 36 months compared to 29 (22.8 %) of 127 who had a negative scan and at 
least one committee assessment. At 36 months sensitivity (secondary analysis) of flutemetamol (18F) 
scan  to  show  the  MCI  conversion  rate  to  AD  in  81  converters  was  64.2 %  (95%  CI:  53 %  to  75 %), 
specificity (secondary analysis) in 143 non-converters was 68.5% (95% CI: 60% to 76%). Based on the 
majority read, the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2.04 and 0.52, respectively. The design of 
this study did not allow for estimating the risk of MCI progression to clinical AD. 
Kappa scores of inter-reader agreement between pairs of readers ranged from 77% (κ = 0.56) to 98% (κ 
= 0.96). Agreement between Readers 1, 3, 4 and 5 taken in pairs ranged from 90 to 98% but between 
Reader 2 and each of the other 4 readers ranged from 77 to 85%.  The intra-reader reproducibility of the 
rereads was good, ranging from 86% to 100%. 
Study GE067-021 
This  study  evaluated  the  performance of  an  electronic  program  for  training  five  PET  scan  readers via 
blinded  visual  interpretations  of  276  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  image  sets  selected  from  previous

flutemetamol clinical trials. Performance was assessed in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of each 
reader.  
Seven analysis populations were defined to address the study objectives:  
•  Analysis Population 1 (n = 135) consisted of subjects with any SoT type.  
•  Analysis Population 2 (n = 104) consisted of all subjects from analysis population 1 except the 31 
subjects from study GE067-015. 
•  Analysis Population 3 (n = 68) consisted of those 68 subjects from analysis population 1 of the 
autopsy study 
•  Analysis Population 4 (n = 276) consisted of subjects with a variety of diagnoses.  
•  Analysis Population 5 (n = 29) consisted of subjects whose images were drawn randomly without 
replacement from Analysis Population 4.  
•  Analysis Population 6 (n = 80) consisted of subjects with aMCI  
•  Analysis Population 7 (n = 8) consisted of subjects with aMCI from Analysis Population 5.  
The  primary  analyses  consisted  of  determining  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  blinded  visual 
interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET images without anatomic images, which were determined from 
subjects with any SoT type (Analysis Population 1).  
Secondarily, the diagnostic performance of the blinded visual interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET 
images  of  the  brain  without  anatomic  images  was  determined  in  subjects  with  autopsy  (Analysis 
Population 3) (table 17).

SoT is based on interpretation of brain tissue with regards to amyloid levels using Bielschowsky silver stain (brain autopsy for GE067-007). 
The  results  from  these  analyses  in  Analysis  Population  3  were  compared  to  the  results  from  study 
GE067-007 (which used in-person training of readers).  There were no meaningful differences between 
the two methods of reader training (electronic vs. in-person) in sensitivity and specificity observed for the 
five readers. In fact, those readers showing higher sensitivities were at the same time those showing 
lower specificities. The Spearman correlation coefficient of the five pairs of accuracy estimates (analysis 
conducted by the CHMP) was strong (Spearman’s rho= -0.68). 
In Analysis Population 3:   
• 
There were 3 FN cases for the majority of readers, all occurred in subjects with sparse or moderate 
neuritic plaque density (2 had a neuropathology diagnosis of Lewy Body Disease (LBD), and 1 of 
Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)).   
•  4 were FP by the majority interpretation (all had  a  neuropathological  diagnosis  of  Lewy  Body 
Disease (Dementia with Lewy Body or Parkinson’s disease).  The applicant explains them likely 
due to diffuse plaques.   
There were no significant differences between the results obtained without anatomic images and those 
obtained with anatomic images for any reader. 
Inter-reader  agreement  (Analysis  Population  4,  table  18)  across  all  5  readers  was  81%;  this 
corresponded to a kappa score of 0.83. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for kappa exceeded the 
pre-specified criterion (0.6) for study success. All other kappa scores (for pairwise comparisons of reader 
interpretations) also met the success criterion.  The percentage of self-agreement (in analysis population 
5) for repeated blinded visual interpretations without anatomic images was 100% for Reader 1, 97% for 
Readers 2, and 4, and was 93% for Readers 3 and 5.

Reader confidence without anatomic images for Analysis Population 4 ranged from 61-97%, depending on 
the reader.  Those with low reader confidence ranged from <1 to 20%.  If PET images were assessed 
combined with anatomic images, the corresponding levels of reader confidence were in similar ranges. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The company contended that the clinical efficacy of PET with flutemetamol (18F) had been demonstrated 
by the findings in three key studies (phase III studies GE067-007, -015 and -021), supported by four 
phase III biopsy studies (GE067-008, -009, -010 and -011), one phase III ongoing study (GE067-005), 
one phase II study (ALZ201) and a pooled analysis of data.  The phase III study in healthy volunteers 
(GE067-015) and the study GE067-021 which did not recruit patients were not considered as pivotal by 
the CHMP.  Therefore, the CHMP considered that there was only one pivotal study (i.e. GE067-007) to 
base this application on, and for that reason the points to consider for submitting a single pivotal study 
in  support  of  marketing  authorization  (CPMP/EMA/2330/99),  as  well  as  the  “Guideline  on  Clinical 
Evaluation  of  Diagnostic  Agents”  (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev  1)  and  Appendix  1  on  Imaging  Agents 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/321180/2008) were considered to apply in this case. 
The proposed indication was as follows: 
 “This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
VIZAMYL is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for 
the visual detection of amyloid-beta neuritic plaques in the brains of adults who are being evaluated for 
Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD).    A  normal  VIZAMYL  scan  indicates  sparse  to  no  neuritic  plaques  and  is 
inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the point of image acquisition: a normal scan 
reduces the likelihood that a patient’s condition is due to AD.  An abnormal VIZAMYL scan is indicative of 
moderate to frequent amyloid-beta neuritic plaques.  Neuropathological examinations have shown this 
amount of neuritic plaques is present in patients with AD, but also other types of neurologic conditions as 
well as in older people with normal cognition. VIZAMYL is to be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic 
evaluations.  
An abnormal VIZAMYL scan does not establish a diagnosis of AD. 
The safety and efficacy of VIZAMYL have not been established for predicting the development of dementia 
or other neurological conditions, or for monitoring response to therapies.” 
The recommended dose was of 185 MBq of flutemetamol (18F), administered intravenously (as a bolus 
over approximately 40 seconds) at a maximum volume of 10 mL.  The images should be acquired starting 
90 minutes after injection.  The scan duration should typically be 20 minutes.   
Flutemetamol (18F) is intended for registration for a pathological indication (i.e. with PET imaging for the 
visual detection of amyloid-beta neuritic plaques in the brain).  The company has also focused on the use 
of  flutemetamol  (18F)  for  a  concrete  diagnostic  paradigm  (i.e.  as  an  adjunct  to  other  diagnostic 
evaluations in adults who are being evaluated for AD for refutation of a neuropathological diagnosis of 
AD, reducing the likelihood that the patient’s condition is due to AD). Approval has not been requested for 
the use of this radiopharmaceutical for establishing a diagnosis of AD, predicting the development of 
dementia or other neurological conditions, or for monitoring response to therapies.  
For the validation of flutemetamol (18F) as an imaging PET agent, two stages have to be considered: 
a)  An initial phase in which it is established how well (the relevant types of) brain β–amyloid deposition 
can be visualized and quantified by flutemetamol (18F) in the relevant areas 
b)  Further phase(s) where the efforts are aimed at demonstrating which particular practical purpose(s) 
the imaging is useful for and how this is achieved, i.e. for a particular use in clinical practice.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
 PIVOTAL STUDY GE067-007  
Both the abovementioned phases were attempted in the pivotal study GE067-007, in which the visual 
detection  of  amyloid-beta  neuritic  plaques  in  the  brain  on  PET  images  was  assessed  versus 
histopathology of autopsied samples as a Standard of Truth (SOT). The approach of using autopsy data 
as the SOT is justified as it can demonstrate that the results obtained with the investigational diagnostic 
agent are valid for estimation of plaque detection (even if not sufficient for the diagnosis of a particular 
disease). 
The  clinical  use  of  PET  with  flutemetamol  (18F)  will  rely  on  its  accurate  quantitative  and  topographic 
assessment of beta amyloid accumulation in the brain.  Relevant quantitative correlation in quantity and 
topography  of  PET  images  with  autopsy  specimens  should  be  demonstrated.    Study  GE067-007 
attempted to demonstrate this as a secondary objective.  
The clinical value of the estimation (quantity and topography) of beta amyloid deposition in brain is still 
a matter of discussion in the scientific community.  If there is to be such a value (i.e. for designation of a 
patient as beta amyloid positive/negative or for a definitive diagnosis/exclusion of a specific beta amyloid 
pathology) any in vivo reliable method of estimation of beta amyloid deposition  has to demonstrate its 
sensitivity/specificity for the particular clinical setting and population in which it is intended to be used.   
In this sense, the pivotal study GE067-007 primarily aimed at demonstrating sensitivity of the amyloid 
burden in the whole brain on flutemetamol (18F) PET images without anatomic brain images (evaluated 
by  five  blinded  readers  on  a  binary  visual  scale  as  normal/abnormal)  versus  the  quantitative 
measurement by BSS at pathology.  As a secondary objective, specificity was also assessed.  It refers to 
sensitivity and specificity of PET to classify a patient as “beta-amyloid present” or “beta-amyloid absent”, 
based on the patient’s neuropathological diagnosis. 
A secondary analysis of the pivotal study was performed to demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of PET 
for the diagnosis of AD based on the patient’s neuropathological diagnosis using NIA-Reagan diagnostic 
criteria for AD.  The likelihood of AD using these criteria is based solely on histopathological assessment 
(both  neuritic  plaque  density  and  neurofibrillary  tangle  score).    However,  pre-specified  levels  of 
age-related brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque at autopsy should be integrated with the presence of a clinical 
history  of  dementia  to  arrive  at  a  diagnostic  level  of  certainty  with  regard  to  AD  (Mirra  et  al.  1991).  
Therefore, sensitivity and specificity for the clinical diagnosis of AD cannot be concluded from the pivotal 
study results. 
In an attempt to assess clinical utility of the flutemetamol (18F) PET imaging, the predictive values of the 
test for detection of beta amyloid accumulation were included as a post-hoc analysis in the pivotal study.  
However, this approach does not comply with the relevant guideline to evaluate the clinical usefulness of 
a medicinal diagnostic product. According to the requirements for this it would be needed to address the 
impact  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  imaging  on  diagnostic  thinking  or  on  patient  management  in  the 
intended population and clinical context. Such impact was not assessed. 
Participants underwent a MRI/CT prior or simultaneous to PET to allow appropriate anatomic location of 
the PET signal, which is of paramount importance in patients with cerebral atrophy which makes  PET 
image interpretation difficult.  Additional secondary endpoint(s) in the pivotal study included review of 
anatomic brain images along with the PET images to compare their validity versus PET-only images. 
Inter-reader variability was also calculated.  Intra-reader variability was designed to be assessed 
in only 10% of patients which, in this study, is a very small sample size for any conclusions to be 
considered as solid.

and to have a short anticipated life expectancy of approximately 1 year or less (resulting in patients with 
very different pathologies -cancer, heart failure, as well as pre-defined dementia and other non-dementia 
medical conditions). These patients were not considered to be the best reflection neither of the actual 
range/distribution  of  brain  β–amyloid  deposits  nor  of  the  cognitive  status  expected  in  the  intended 
population for routine clinical use of flutemetamol (18F) (i.e. “adults who are being evaluated for AD”).  
Indeed,  their  clinical  diagnosis  of  dementia  subtype  (if present)  was  likely  to  be  inaccurate  as  it  was 
determined  only  on  the  basis  of  previous  clinical  history  and  a  very  brief  neurological  examination, 
without performing other mandatory laboratory tests needed to exclude the presence of either significant 
white  matter  disease  or  other  non-neurodegenerative  dementias.    Moreover,  such  dementia  status 
referred to the time of PET imaging and it might have changed within the time interval between PET and 
autopsy.   Although the choice of this “end-of-life” population for the primary analysis has an impact 
on  the  external  validity  of  this  pivotal  study,  and  the  diagnostic  utility  in  the  intended  clinical 
population  has  to  be  established,  such  population  indeed  allows  for  the  assessment  of  the 
correlation of PET versus histopathology within a reasonable timeframe. 
A visual PET reading method was used in the pivotal study since amendment 1.  However, the method was 
not previously optimized for in-vivo detection of brain beta amyloid deposition.  
PET  images  were  visually  interpreted  by  independent  readers,  who  were  in-person  trained  in  the 
interpretation of such images and blinded to the SOT results and any other information about the subject. 
The reader had to complete both PET-only and PET plus anatomic reference review with criteria of “normal, 
“abnormal” or “non-evaluable”.   
Quantificaation of PET images was also performed.  Such quantitative assessment of flutemetamol (18F) 
PET images was conducted at 15 recruiting sites in the United States and 4 in the UK. It is known from the 
literature (Boellaard 2011) that the quantification e.g. of whole-body fludeoxyglucose (18F) PET studies 
is  affected  by  many  physiological  and  physical  factors.  It  was  outlined  that  the  variability  seen  in 
quantification  of  fludeoxyglucose  (18F)  uptake  using  SUV  will  not  be  present  in  the  quantification  of 
flutemetamol (18F) uptake, mainly as a result of the use of a reference region for the estimation of the 
SUVR,  but  also  as  a  result  of  the  differences  in  tracer  characteristics.  Substantial  variability  in  image 
quality or accuracy due to the multiple-site study design was also avoided through carefully conducted 
site initiation and qualifications of imaging equipment. 
Autopsied  samples  were  assessed  by  BSS  and  IHC  with  48G.    Both  techniques  can  be  considered 
well-accepted for evaluating and measuring beta amyloid deposition in the brain post-mortem.   
It is known that IHC with 48G measures both neuritic and diffuse plaques combined.  Estimation by BSS 
was used for the SOT since the first protocol amendment; however it was not previously optimized as to 
detect the relevant types/quantity/neuroanatomical location of beta amyloid accumulation. 
The  interpretation  criterion  for  the  post-mortem  estimates  used  as  SoT  in  study  GE067-007  was  not 
validated.  The company modified the standardized widely used post-mortem CERAD criteria (Mirra et al. 
1991)  to  convert  the  semiquantitative  assessment  of  neuritic  plaques  (none,  sparse,  moderate  and 
frequent) of 8 particular cortical areas directly into a neuropathologic diagnosis.  For diagnosis of AD, this 
approach  is  not  valid,  since:  1)  neither  the  patient’s  age  nor  the  clinical  information  regarding  the 
presence  or  absence  of  dementia  -as  estipulated  in  the  original  CERAD  criteria-  were  taken  into 
consideration, and 2) more than 3 particular neocortical regions were included for assessment.  This way, 
the final neuropathologic diagnosis refers simply to the presence of higher than 1.5 of mean score of 
neuritic plaque density in at least one out of 8 particular brain regions and not to the definitive diagnosis 
or exclusion of AD.  The choice of those eight particular brain regions to be analysed has not been justified 
as  relevant  for  the  clinical  context  in  which  this  radiopharmaceutical  is  intended.    The  interpretation 
criterion  for  the  post-mortem  estimates  of  amyloid  beta  deposition  is  not  validated  criterion  of

abnormality.  On the other hand, a mean regional score not exceeding 1.5 in all those 8 particular regions 
is not a validated criterion for normality.  The final diagnosis of neuritic plaque density (as none-sparse or 
moderate-frequent) should ideally match the CERAD criteria (Mirra et al. 1991) [i.e. be established based 
on the maximal neuritic plaque density measured on sections of middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle 
temporal gyri, and inferior parietal lobe].  
The original protocol was amended twice during pivotal trial, changing several critical aspects of the trial 
such as the main objectives, primary efficacy endpoint, primary efficacy analysis, sample size estimation 
and interim analysis. Several of the changes concern directly the efficacy analysis and they might have 
impacted on the validity of the results.  
The original primary endpoint was the region-specific estimate of cortical tracer uptake determined from 
quantitative analysis of the flutemetamol (18F) PET images. The calculated sample size was 20 sample 
brains and a well-designed interim analysis was planned to be conducted when 12 sample brains were 
collected. Statistical considerations addressed adequately the impact of this interim analysis on Type I 
error rate using O’Brian-Fleming spending function.   
The first amendment switched primary efficacy analyses to computing exact 95% binomial confidence 
interval for the sensitivity of 3 independent blinded visual assessments of flutemetamol (18F) PET images 
with anatomic images for detecting brain fibrillar Aβ. The protocol considered a simple majority to be the 
criteria to classify each subject’s PET image as normal or abnormal. Sample size was calculated to have 
90% power to demonstrate that the lower limit of the 95% exact confidence interval of sensitivity of the 
majority read was greater than 70%. The sample size calculation gave a minimun of 22 evaluable brains 
that are fibrillar Aβ-positive according to the SOT (post-mortem examination of tissue specimens from 
cortical  brain  regions).  This  first  amendment  also  eliminated  the  interim  analysis  although  an 
Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  monitored  accrual  and  prompted  study  termination 
when the sample size of 22 abnormal brains was reached.  
The second amendment further changed the primary efficacy analysis. After the amendment, the primary 
efficacy endpoint was the blinded visual assessment of brain PET images as normal or abnormal without 
anatomic brain images for reference performed by 5 independent blinded readers, individually trained, in 
the evaluation of PET fibrillar Aβ imaging. The primary analysis was changed from assessing 95% exact 
confidence interval of sensitivity computed for a majority read (two of three raters) to assessing exact 
confidence intervals of sensitivity computed on an individual reader basis (five raters). In this way, the 
primary objective was changed to demonstrate that at least three of the 5 readers show lower limits of 
their  sensitivity  95%  exact  CI  greater  than  70%.  The  Primary  Efficacy  analysis  was  planned  to  be 
performed  when  at  least  31  brains  were  deemed  fibrillar  Aβ-positive  according  to  the  SOT.  This  new 
sample size estimation was based on a different assumption than the one used in the first amendment 
sample size calculation. In fact, the true sensitivity was estimated to be lower (92%) than in the first 
amendment (95%). This prompted the sample size to rise from 22 to 31 subjects. 
The second amendment also stipulated that an IDMC would review the pathological data resulting from 
brain tissue analyses on an ongoing basis during the study. When the IDMC determined that the study 
had accrued at least 31 brains that are pathologically abnormal for fibrillar Ab ("amyloid-positive”), or 22 
amyloid-negative brains, and they had a corresponding assessable PET image, the IDMC was to inform the 
applicant of this finding. When the applicant had confirmed such results, it would declare that the study 
stopping rule had been met. The charter document of the IDMC stated that after 31 amyloid-positive 
brains and every three new amyloid-positive brain were accrued, the IDMC would communicate to the 
sponsor that a new milestone had been reached.  
The brains of all subjects who died after the declaration that the stopping rule was met were planned to 
be preserved and stored for possible future full analysis if requested by a regulatory authority, or if the 
company determined that such analysis would be useful. Collection of brains after the stopping rule was 
Vizamyl

set up to continue until either 1) the brains of all scanned subjects had been collected, or 2) flutemetamol 
was approved, whichever occurred first. 
The primary efficacy analysis set up at amendment 2 has the following drawbacks: 
1.  It relegates specificity as secondary outcome.  The guideline on the evaluation of diagnostic products 
(CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev.1) requires both sensitivity and specificity as co-primary endpoints.  Both 
sensitivity  and  specificity  are  negatively  correlated  and  a  slight  change  on  a  rater’s  threshold  for 
classifying an image as positive impacts on both sensitivity and specificity.  
2.  The success criterion (the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval for sensitivity 
being greater than a priori threshold of 70% for at least 3 of the 5 reader results) seemed a little 
demanding and was not justified in terms of clinical relevance.  
Despite  the  fact  that  the  trial  was  designed  to  stop after  the  company  had  confirmed  that  there  was 
recruitment of 31 amyloid-positive brains, the study further continued including 12 extra amyloid-positive 
subjects, to allow at least 22 amyloid-negative brains to accrue.  In a total of 68 autopsied patients with 
evaluable images, there were only 2 cases (1 for reader 2 and 1 for reader 4) considered unevaluable by 
those readers. Every reader’s assessments were independent of the milestones reported by the IDMC or 
the Sponsor’s decision to stop the study.   
During the conduct of the study, the following other issues were changed raising some concerns: 
•  Before amendment 1, it was possible to administer a dose as low as 111 MBq with similar acquisition 
time (30 min) although with a less than optimal image quality.  No subjects were dosed with less than 
185 MBq. Since some subjects could not tolerate lying still for 30 minutes because of the severity of 
their illness, they were allowed to receive a higher activity (up to 370 MBq) to shorten the imaging 
time.  Inclusion of a 370 MBq dose in posology would affect radiation dosimetry but not efficacy. For 
subjects  who  could  not  tolerate  lying  still  for  20  minutes  application  of  a  370  MBq  activity  for  10 
minutes  could  be  a  more  feasible  alternative  if  the  higher  radiation  exposure  is  justifiable.The 
anatomic  image  for  appropriate  PET  signal  location  for  some  secondary  endpoints  was  originally 
either MRI or CT; however, at amendment 2 was exclusively CT.  The company stated that, in the 
pivotal autopsy study in 68 patients, there were 54 patients who had a CT scan, 6 with MRI and 8 with 
both CT and MRI.  There were very few patients in the MRI subgroup.  It is unknown how the efficacy 
results of PET with flutemetamol (18F) in the autopsy study might have been affected by the change 
of the type of anatomic image to localize PET signal (the option of MRI/CT was changed exclusively for 
CT at amendment 2).    
•  Some protocol deviations were noted that related to the volume of radiopharmaceutical administered 
in 8 patients in a single center (the site was diluting dose to a more convenient volume); this raised 
concerns whether the clinical sites conducted the trial following the standards.  Six patients in the 
pivotal study were identified as having protocol deviations which potentially might have interfered 
with the efficacy evaluation.  They were classified as relating to radiopharmaceutical’s activity, to the 
time when PET image was acquired and to the time when CT was performed in relation to PET.  It was 
concluded  that  they  were  unlikely  to  have  affected  efficacy  results  since  only  2  incorrect 
interpretations were obtained from those patient’s images, which did not affect the majority result. 
RE-READING STUDY GE067-026 
As collection of brains had been set up to continue, the CHMP requested data obtained from all recruited 
patients that had already been autopsied to be presented by means of a well-designed re-reading study.  
The  company  presented  the  protocol  for  the  required  study  (GE067-026),  to  assess  sensitivity  and 
specificity  for  detection  of  neuritic  plaque  density  of  the  majority  read  of  the visual  subject-level  PET 
reading vs histopathology in all autopsied patients from the pivotal study who had already died and be 
autopsied by June 10th, 2013.   
It is well accepted that sensitivity and specificity are considered as co-primary endpoints, that the primary 
analysis relies on the majority reading with anatomic images being used at the discretion of the reader as 
Vizamyl

in  clinical  practice,  and  that  readers  were  trained  electronically  as  intended  in  clinical  practice.    The 
company guaranteed that the electronic training programme used in the re-reading study was similar to 
that previously provided in DVD/CD in the dossier and to that which with this radiopharmaceutical will be 
marketed if approved. The final diagnosis of the neuritic plaque density for the co-primary endpoints was 
not made according to validated international guidelines as CERAD criteria (Mirra et al. 1991).  It should 
have been defined as follows:  
If  neuritic  plaque  density  is  none-sparse  in  the  region  of  maximum  involvement  among  3  predefined 
regions (middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyri, and inferior parietal lobe), the subject 
is to be considered as amyloid-absent.   
A subject is considered as with amyloid present if there is moderate-frequent neuritic plaque density in the 
region of maximum involvement among those 3 predefined regions. 
When the study GE067-026 was concluded, it was known that the CERAD criteria were not implemented 
for  the  co-primary  endpoints  (only  for  a  secondary  endpoint)  but  modified  to  consider  a  subject  as 
amyloid-absent  if  a  mean  regional  score  did  not  exceed  1.5  for  neuritic  plaque  density  in  all  the  8 
assessed particular regions.  A subject was considered as with amyloid present considering that a mean 
regional score was higher than 1.5 for neuritic plaque density, as established by a single neuropathologist, 
in at least one out of 8 particular brain regions in autopsy specimens 
The success criteria was initially planned to be based on point estimates  instead of an approximation 
based on 95%CI or in simultaneous hypothesis contrast (for both co-primary endpoints).  Finally criteria 
based on the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals of the co-primary endpoints, sensitivity and 
specificity, were used.  Although an inferior 95%CI limit of 80% was accepted as adequate, the study was 
performed  using  an  inadequate  inferior  95%CI  limit  for  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  75%  and  60%, 
respectively.  The  cognitive  impairment  status  of  recruited  patients  in  the  pivotal  study  was  likely 
inaccurate  as  derermined  only  on  the  basis  of  previous  clinical  history  and  a  very  brief  neurological 
examination  without  performing  other  routine  laboratory  tests  to  exclude  the  presence  of  either 
significant white matter disease or other non-neurodegenerative dementias.  This analysis was removed 
in the final protocol. 
POOLED ANALYSES 
The  company  presented  pooled  analyses  of  the  11  studies  composing  the  flutemetamol  clinical 
development  programme,  as  supportive.    However,  these  analyses  involved  a  mixture  of 
populations,  different  SOTs,  different  PET reader  training  methods,  different  number  of readers 
and different primary objectives.  Therefore, the pooled analyses did not provide any additional 
accurate information of efficacy of PET with flutemetamol (18F). 
STUDY GE067-015 
The supportive phase 3 study GE067-015 aimed at assessing the overall specificity of Flutemetamol 
F 18 Injection for excluding the presence of brain amyloid deposition based on the visual assessment of 
a PET scan for 5 readers (previously trained in-person) from a population of healthy YV aged 18 to 40.  
Analysis of specificity in healthy controls is adequate to rule out false positive scans, but conclusions on 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014

external  validity  are  limited  since  the  enrolled  population  for  this  analysis  does  not  reflect  real  life 
population. 
The study involved reading of PET images of HV mixed with PET images of all aMCI patients recruited in 
another study of flutemetamol (18F) (study GE067-005) to avoid biases.   
The  inter-  and  intra-observer  concordance  was  established  by  assessing  the  percent  in  agreement 
without  considering  the  agreement  by  chance.    Such  assessment  is  not  appropriate.    In  this  study, 
agreement by chance is very likely high due to the disbalance between the frequency of normal image 
sets (from HVs) and from abnormal image sets (from study GE067-005).  In this sense, it would have 
been  important  to  analyze  the  criteria  using  images  from  study  GE067-005,  particularly  because  in 
case-control studies the diagnostic performance of the test might have been higher since it is easy to 
distinguish between normal and abnormal cases. 
Studies GE067-008, -009, -010 and -011 
Additionally,  four  small-sized  Phase  3  biopsy  studies  (GE067-008,  -009,  -010  and  -011)  aimed  at 
demonstrating the correlation between the estimation of beta amyloid deposition by histopathological 
methods  from  biopsied  cortical  samples  in  patients  with  normal  pressure  hydrocephalus  (NPH)  and 
quantitative analysis of PET images.  
Each of these four supportive studies lack enough precision to draw firm conclusions on the correlation 
between quantitative PET analysis and histopathology, and the diagnostic performance of visual PET scan 
reading in the recruited population.  This is due to the fact biopsy did not allow for a reliable SOT estimate, 
since  the  area  in  which  PET  signal  was  quantitated  and  the  biopsied  area  did  not  fully  match 
topographically, and in patients with asymmetric patterns of beta amyloid deposition the assumption of 
similar depositions in different areas is not valid.  Additionally the company did not demonstrate that the 
presence  or  absence  of  amyloid  in  a  relatively  circumscribed  sample  of  brain  tissue  can  reliably  be 
extrapolated to a global assessment of cerebral amyloid load.   
Study ALZ201 
The  intended  role  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  was  to  exclude  the  diagnosis  of  AD  in  adults  who  are  being 
evaluated for AD.  There are limited clinical data addressing this issue coming from the supportive ALZ201 
trial.    The  study  was  primarily  aimed  at  differentiating  AD  from  normal  cognition,  by  a  visual 
interpretation  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  images,  and  secondarily  to  differentiate  them  from  MCI.  
Quantitative analysis of PET image, image quality and reproducibility were also assessed.  Test-retest 
variability was assessed in a subgroup of patients with pAD.  The study also attempted to provide with 
comparative data between flutemetamol (18F) and [11C]PiB in some of the recruited patients with clinical 
AD and all with aMCI.   
All those previous analyses were also done in all recruited sample at 2-year follow-up.  The sensitivity of 
the visual reading of baseline PET scan was determined for subjects diagnosed as pAD at the follow-up, 
and the specificity for subjects diagnosed as HVs.  Then, there was a 2-year gap between the PET scan 
and  the  clinical  diagnosis,  which  introduces  uncertainty  into  the  calculated  values  of  sensitivity  and 
specificity.  The design of this study did not allow for estimating the risk of MCI progression to clinical AD. 
Enrolled subjects in this supportive study did not encompass the overall anticipated population in which 
flutemetamol  (18F)  is  to  be  used.  Indeed,  not  all  tests  standardized  for  management  of  patients 
suspected of AD were followed to confirm the absence of systemic disorders or other brain diseases that 
in  and  of  themselves  could  account  for  the  progressive  cognitive  impairment.    Moreover,  the  clinical 
diagnosis is not an appropriate SOT to support claims for AD diagnosis, due to its well-known lack of 
diagnostic performance.  For these reasons, results from study ALZ201 cannot reliably be extrapolated to 
the proposed indication for use.

Study GE067-005 
The patients in this supportive study were all with aMCI based on the Petersen criteria.   Conclusions 
regarding  the  relative  progression  to  AD  over  a  3-year  period  of  normal  PET  and  abnormal  PET 
populations  of  aMCI  might  attempt  to  support  a  prognosis  indication,  which  is  not  the  intended  use 
requested for flutemetamol (18F) at the moment.  It has to be kept in mind that the study results might 
have been biased since the protocol had been amendment 5 times involving crucial issues such as efficacy 
endpoints, main objective, primary and secondary endpoints and sample size. The applicant justified the 
3-year  study  follow-up  period  based  on  a  published  meta-analysis  of  studies  reporting  the  rate  of 
conversion from aMCI to AD.  However, there are published reports of conversion rate with a much longer 
follow-up period.   
Study GE067-021 
The Applicant had chosen the electronic training programme, and not in-person training, to be available 
to physicians post-approval.  The clinical development of flutemetamol (18F) included a phase 3 trial 
attempting  to  evaluate  efficacy  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  images  after  electronic  training  of  PET 
readers: study GE067-021.  In this study no patients were recruited and flutemetamol (18F) PET 
image sets were selected from 9 previous flutemetamol clinical trials in subjects with histopathological 
confirmation  of  their  brain  amyloid  status,  young  HVs,  elderly  HVs,  subjects  with  clinically  pAD  and 
subjects with aMCI. 
Validation  of  the  electronic  programme  in  study  GE067-021  was  attempted  in  different  population 
subgroups using different statistical analyses and different reference/truth standards.  Regarding analysis 
of sensitivity and specificity of visual interpretation of PET images, results from the autopsied population 
subgroup (i.e. analysis population 3), for the estimation of brain beta amyloid neuritic plaque density 
could be considered as supportive.  The analysis population 3 in this study matches the post-mortem 
analysis population of study GE067-007, which accounts for comparative purposes.  
Sensitivity  and  specificity  results,  if  analysed  in  the  patients  with  aMCI,  for  confirming  or  refuting  of 
clinical diagnosis of aMCI, can also be considered of interest.  However, such population subgroups were 
composed  of  some  mixed  patients  of  both  study  GE057-005  and  ALZ201,  and  therefore  no  direct 
comparison to those individual studies is possible. 
Regarding  evaluation  of  sensitivity  and  specificity,  the  mixing  of  different  populations  diagnosed  by 
different SOTs raises concerns about potential bias of the results since the prevalence of beta amyloid 
deposition will differ among the different populations.   
Other issues related to the clinical development programme 
Concerning interpretation of PET images, two distinct methods have been used during the development 
programme: a binary visual and a quantitative one. However, the applicant did not justify why the visual 
method of PET scan reading as a composite measure for the whole brain was chosen as principal for the 
pivotal and most supportive studies, instead of the quantitative one which was also performed in most 
trials, if not all.  There are differences in the visual interpretation of PET images among the pivotal study, 
supportive  phase  II-III  clinical  studies,  the  method  recommended  in  the  SmPC  and  the  one  to  be 
provided by an electronic training programme.  The electronic version is the methodology proposed in 
clinical practice.

The clinical efficacy cannot be concluded only from the data from the pivotal study due to its 
methodological limitations and for that reasons the conclusions on efficacy will also be based on study 
GE067-021 which validated the electronic programme, and on the re-reading GE067-26 study.   
The latter two studies did not implement similar criteria for colour scale and regions to be assessed as in 
the pivotal study, but the respective criteria proposed in the SmPC and the electronic training can be 
considered acceptable. 
The  visual  reading  criteria  that  identify  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  scans  as  positive  or  negative  have

inherent difficulties and represent a challenge.  PET images of the brain are known to be difficult to read, 
and the difficulty increases also from the intrinsic characteristics of a PET amyloid tracer. The criterion for 
positivity in the visual method is looking at the loss of reduction of radioactive signal intensity between 
white matter (with invariably high uptake) and grey matter (with either no radiopharmaceutical uptake (if 
normal) or some level of uptake (if abnormal)).  Traditional scanners in use today often lack the fine 
volumetric resolution and high-contrast ratio required to precisely differentiate between grey and white 
matter.  Because grey and white matter are interlaced in such a compact way, and also due to the size of 
the grey matter (about 5 mm), distinguishing both can be challenging.  Additionally, in cases where the 
uptake  in  grey  matter  is  insufficient  (as  for  example  in  borderline  cases  with  insufficient  intensity  of 
amyloid deposition, or in cases with reduction of grey matter width as in brain atrophy) this challenge is 
increasing.  
Statistics  can  improve  the  accuracy  of  diagnosis  beyond  that  attainable  by  a  human  observer.    The 
strength  of  this  approach  is  that,  no  a  priori  hypothesis  is  required  about  the  locations  that  may  be 
affected  and  the  whole  volume  is  automatically  analyzed.    Comprehensive  packages  are  available  for 
statistical comparison of brain perfusion SPECT.  The differences between the normal database and the 
test subjects are expressed and, to help to interpretate the differences, functional images are displayed.  
They may allow for a single subject diagnosis. A methodology to help distinguish between white and grey 
matter  in  PET  scans  and  help  quantify  the  intensity  of  amyloid  uptake  in  grey  matter  would  be  an 
important tool and is potentially achievable nowadays in clinical practice.  The applicant has already used 
a quantitative PET reading methodology in the clinical programme, and that is why it is recommended 
that the company should develop and validate a quantitative reading PET methodology based on their 
product. 
Technical problems in the scan itself (noise or oversmoothing) or in brain anatomy (levels of atrophy) can 
affect the anatomical location of the gray matter/white matter border and are important to be considered 
in the interpretation of a flutemetamol (18F) PET scan. MRI or CT scans may be helpful for discerning 
anatomy in cases in which atrophy or a low quality scan complicate the PET image interpretation. The 
CHMP  highly  encouraged  the  use  of  a  co-registered  recent  MRI  image  or  CT  scan  for  the  visual 
interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET scans, particularly in those cases in which there is uncertainty 
about the location of grey matter and grey/white matter border on the PET scan.  For these reasons the 
following  paragraphs  were  recommended  to  be  included  in  sections  4.2.  and  4.4.  of  the  SmPC, 
respectively: 
 “VIZAMYL images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with 
flutemetamol (18F). A recent co-registered computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging of the patient to get a fused PET-CT or PET-MR image is recommended in cases of uncertainty 
about the location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border in the PET scan (see section 4.4 
Interpretation of VIZAMYL images).” 
“Some scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or 
image blur, which could lead to interpretation errors. For cases in which there is uncertainty about the 
location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border on the PET scan, and a co-registered recent 
CT or MR image is available, the interpreter should examine the fused PET-CT or PET-MR image to clarify 
the relationship of the PET radioactivity and the grey matter anatomy.” 
Flutemetamol  (18F)  will  be  prescribed  by  physicians  skilled  in  the  clinical  management  of 
neurodegenerative disorders.  Another requirement is that PET scans be read blinded to clinical data as 
done in the autopsy studies. This is acceptable since the clinical status of the patient might influence the 
image interpretation if atrophy is suspected. This is included in the SmPC although it will be hard to be 
fulfilled  considering  that  Nuclear  Medicine  physicians  usually  review  clinical  data  to  interpret  brain 
SPECT/PET images. 
Due to the difficulties for visual qualitative interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET scans, it is mandatory 
to  complete  an  appropriate  reader  training  prior  to  routine  clinical  image  interpretation.  Two  distinct

methods have been used during the clinical development: an in-person training (in studies GE067-007, 
-015, -005 and ALZ201) and the electronic training (in study 021), but the proposed PET reading method 
as described in the SmPC and in the electronic training programme can be considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE 
The  pivotal  study  has  some  important  methodological  drawbacks  and  limitations  which  prevent  from 
concluding that adequate diagnostic performance of PET wit flutemetamol (18F) has been demonstrated. 
From  176  subjects  in  the  pivotal  study  GE067-007  who  underwent  PET  imaging,  68  who  died  and 
underwent brain autopsy were considered evaluable for the SOT assessment (Postmortem Analysis set).  
The age range of the population 60-95, and the mean value ~ 80 years are not representative ot the 
target population in clinical practice.  The same is true for the levels of cognitive impairment which may 
be different from that of the intended population considering that only 31% patients had no history of 
cognitive impairment, about 44% had AD, 25% had other dementias, and none had MCI.   
Although the success criterion of the study was met (see Table 16. Summary of Efficacy for study 
GE067-007),  it  is  important  to  note  that  this  result  critically  depended  on  a  very  low  number  of 
participants, making the trial lack robustness. In fact, a minor perturbation such as changing the result of 
just  two  participants,  will  impact  significantly  on  the  whole  trial  result  which  will  be  regarded  as 
unsuccessful. Furthermore, reader 2 and 4 did not rate the images of one subject [MAI3]which in turn was 
doubtfully classified as abnormal whenever readers 1, 3 and 5 rated this subject as normal, abnormal and 
abnormal respectively. 
The  values  of  specificity  of  blinded  visual  PET  image  interpretations  without  anatomic  images  for 
estimation of a non-sparse neuritic plaque densitiy in post-mortem analysis set were 88% (69-98%), 
92% (74-99%), 44% (24-65%), 80% (59-93%) and 92% (74-99%) for each independent reader. The 
company  hypothesized  that  the  very  poor  specificity  observed  with  reader  3  for  the  blinded  visual 
interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET scans without anatomic images might be due to the reader’s 
difficulty  in  differentiating  between  grey  matter  and  white  matter,  to  having  spent  too  little  time  in 
reading images, or to unsuccessful training.   
Sensitivity and specificity of the blinded visual interpretation of PET images for detecting brain fibrillar 
amyloid beta with anatomic images ranged from 91% to 98% and from 56% to 92%, respectively. 
Comparison  of  the  95%  confidence  intervals  for  sensitivity  obtained  with  anatomic  images  to  those 
obtained without anatomic images shows overlap of the confidence intervals for each of the 5 readers.  
In the re-reading study (study GE067-026), the primary objective was to estimate the sensitivity and 
specificity (as co-primary endpoints) of the majority (i.e., the image interpretation reached by at least 3 
of the 5 readers) interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) images for imaging amyloid neuritic plaque density 
versus  histopathology  at  8  particular  brain  regions.    Sensitivity  was  90.8%  with  a  95%  confidence 
interval  of  (81.9%,  96.2%);  the  lower  bound  (81.9%)  exceeded  the  pre-specified  value  of  75%. 
Specificity  was  90.0%  with  a  95%  confidence  interval  of  (73.5%,  97.9%);  the  lower  bound  (73.5%) 
exceeded the pre-specified value of 60%. 
Sensitivity  and  specificity  were  also  determined  as  a  secondary  analysis  using  a  SoT  based  on  the  3 
neocortical regions originally recommended by CERAD [Mirra et al. 1991]. Based on the majority read 
and considering SoT as positive if moderate-frequent beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the region 
of  maximum  involvement  and  negative  if  none-sparse,  sensitivity  for  detection  of  moderate-frequent 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014

beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density was 91.9% with a 95% CI of (83.2%, 97.0%), and specificity was 
87.5% with a 95% CI of (71.0, 96.5%). 
Since false-positive cases have already been detected in the subject-level visual PET assessment of the 
68 autopsied patients in the pivotal study, and there were also false-positive and false-negative cases in 
the re-reading study, and that cerebral atrophy may affect the performance of the subject-level visual 
PET assessment sections  4.2 and 4.4. of the SmPC was modified to reflect that.   
Given the proposed indication in which a normal (negative) scan is intended to rule-out the presence of a 
particular density of neuritic plaques, the negative likelihood ratio is the one of relevance and it ranged 
from moderate to good.  
The company  focused the discussion on the NPV of flutemetamol (18F) PET images without anatomic 
images, which was poor ranging from 73% to 87%, with all five blinded readers having lower limits of the 
95%  confidence  intervals  extending  below  70%  (range  49%  to  66%).  The  NPV  is  known  to  depend 
importantly on the prevalence of the condition which is intended to be excluded. Flutemetamol (18F) is 
going to be used in an adult population with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for AD or other 
cognitive impairment. In such a setting, the prevalence of beta-amyloid neuritic plaques is suspected to 
be  higher  than  the  prevalence  observed  in  the  sample  recruited  in  the  pivotal  study.  This  makes  it 
probable that the actual NPV in the intended population is even lower.  
Results show that the correlation between regional (8 regions) estimates of brain uptake (SUVR) and 
corresponding  post-mortem  estimates  of  brain  fibrillar  Aβ  levels  is  not  significant  as  assessed  by 
multilevel  mixed  models.  This  result  is  consistently  observed  independently  of  the  way  in  which 
post-mortem brain fibrillar Aβ levels are estimated (IHC with 4G8 or BSS). When the multilevel nature of 
the data is ignored and the association between composite SUVR and corresponding brain fibrillar Aβ 
mean  levels  (overall  ROIs)  is  analyzed  using  non-linear  regression  models,  however,  the  association 
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014  
Page 82/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
becomes statistically significant.  These latter models were not planned in the protocol but included in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.   
In summary, correlation PET-autopsy was not significant as analyzed according to the protocol; however, 
using a different statistical approach revealed the correlation to be significantwhich could be also as a 
result of statistical artifacts.     
An additional issue was the fact that in the GE067-007 post-mortem analysis set, 28 of the 68 subjects 
were found to have non-AD neurodegenerative pathology consisting of synucleinopathies (n=20; 13 were 
PET  positive  and  7  were  PET  negative  for  the  majority),  tauopathies  (n=1,  with  negative  PET),  and 
vasculopathy  (n=7;  1  with  PET  positive  and  6  with  PET  negative),  once  again  confirming  the  differences 
between the study population and the one for which the product will be intended in the clinic.  
In study GE067-015, all 181 HVs who received 185 MBq of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection were available for 
blinded visual read of PET images.  The true histopathologic status of these subjects is however unclear 
as it is possible to have beta amyloid deposition in the brain without any symptoms regarding cognition.  
The images were read by 4 out of 5 independent readers (except reader 2) as normal in 99-100% of the 
cases, with the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals exceeding 95%.  Therefore the success 
criterion was met. In this study the  results of Reader 2 raise a concern: a normalilty rate as low as 68% 
with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 67%.  When comparing results from reader 2 and the 
remaining four readers, doubts about the accuracy of the visual reading of flutemetamol (18F) PET scans 
in healthy volunteers can arise.  The high failure rate of reader 2 in Study GE067-015 illustrated the need 
for an appropriate reader training program. To address that, the applicant included several improvements 
in the electronic image training programme intended for clinical use, including more challenging cases 
added to the training and to the training test, especially images which borderline levels of tracer uptake 
in the grey matter.  
Study GE067-008, -009, -010 and -011 lack enough precision to draw firm conclusions on the correlation 
between quantitative PET analysis and histopathology, and the diagnostic performance of visual PET scan 
reading in the recruited population, as discussed previously. 
Study ALZ201 represents a clinical scenario where amyloid imaging (both visual and quantitative PET 
scan reading) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis at baseline.  92% out of 25 recruited subjects with 
clinical diagnosis of probable AD (according to NINCS-ADRDA criteria), 45% out of 20 recruited patients 
with aMCI (based on Petersen criteria) and 4% out of 25 HVs (10 young HVs and 15 older HVs subjects) 
were considered positive after visual PET scan reading by the majority of 5 independent blinded readers.  
All them received a single i.v. dose of 185 MBq of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection, except 5 subjects with pAD 
who received 2 administrations of approximately 120 MBq each. 
The numbers for  AD are consistent with the expected prevalence of amyloid-negative individuals in a 
clinically  diagnosed  AD  population  based  on  some  literature  reports  of  the  false  positive  rate  for  the 
clinical diagnosis of AD versus autopsy.  However, these numbers are inconsistent with other literature 
reports  showing that  20%  of  clinically-diagnosed  AD  subjects  did  not  have  AD  at  autopsy  and  lacked 
amyloid pathology (Lim et al. 1999, Pearl et al. 1997), and with findings from another PET amyloid tracer 
as florbetapir (18F) as shown in the EPAR.   
The observation in aMCI subjects is consistent with the autopsy literature that shows 33% to 62% of MCI 
subjects are positive at post-mortem examination (Bennett, 2005; Petersen, 2006).   
Finally,  the  observation  in  HVs  is  inconsistent  with  literature  reports  that  13%  to  45%  of  apparently 
cognitively HVs subjects have significant beta amyloid pathology at autopsy (Hulette et al. 1998, Davis et 
al. 1999, Price et al. 1999, Schimitt et al. 2000; knopman et al. 2003, Aizenstein et al. 2008) and also 
inconsistent with findings from other PET amyloid tracers as shown in the EPAR. 
Diagnostic  performance  values  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  are  tabulated  below  considering  either  a 
combined set of aMCI plus HVs when assessing the diagnosis of pAD, or a combined set of pAD plus HVs 
when assessing the diagnosis of aMCI:

There  was  significant  correlation  (r2=0.82)  between  quantitative  PET  uptake  values  generated  from 
flutemetamol (18F) and [11C]PiB PET scans in 20 subjects with pAD and 20 with aMCI who also received 
an i.v. dose of [11C]PiB not exceeding 370 MBq on the same day or within approximately 30 days after 
receiving Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.   This comparative data can be considered only as informative 
since [11C]PiB is not an approved radiopharmaceutical and has not been validated up to now. 
Reassessment of the clinical diagnosis in 67 returning subjects at a 2-year follow-up  showed no changes 
from the initial diagnosis for any of the returning pAD subjects (n = 22) or HVs (n = 24). Of the returning 
subjects who had initially been diagnosed with aMCI (n = 19), 9 (47%) were diagnosed to have pAD at the 
2-year follow-up; 7 of these had raised flutemetamol (18F) uptake at baseline. The other 10 (53%), eight 
of whom had negative flutemetamol PET scans, retained at the 2-year follow-up a baseline diagnosis of 
aMCI.  Sensitivity of the visual PET scan reading (including 95% CI) to show the aMCI conversion rate 
from  baseline  to  clinically  probable  AD  at  2-year  follow-up  in  9  converters  was  77.8%  (95%CI: 
40.0%-97.2%), specificity in 10 non-converters was 80.0% (95%CI: 44.4%-97.5%), positive likelihood 
ratio was 3.89 (95% CI: 1.07-14.10) and negative likelihood ratio was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.08-0.98). The 
design of this did not allow for estimating the risk of MCI progression to clinical AD. 
In study GE067-005, a total of 232 subjects with amnestic MCI (Petersen criteria) received an i.v. dose 
of approximately 185 MBq ofFlutemetamol (18F) and were submitted for a 3-year follow-up to determine 
whether  or  not  conversion  to  probable  AD  had  occurred.    At  baseline,  by  the  majority  image 
interpretation, 134 (58%) of the 232 subjects had normal (negative) flutemetamol (18F) scans and 98 
(42%) had abnormal (positive) scans. 
Of the 232 patients enrolled, 224 had at least one post-scan review by the independent committee and 
were included in the analysis. At the 36-month follow-up, 81 (36 %) converted to clinical AD. Of the 97 
MCI  subjects  who  had  a  positive  PET  scan  and  at  least  one  committee  assessment,  52  (54 %)  were 
classified clinically as converted to clinical AD after 36 months compared to 29 (23 %) of 127 who had a 
negative scan and at least one committee assessment. At 36 months sensitivity of flutemetamol (18F) 
scan  to  show  the  MCI  conversion  rate  to  AD  in  81  converters  was  64 %  (95%  CI:  53 %  to  75 %), 
specificity  in  143  non-converters  was  69%  (95%  CI:  60%  to  76%).  Based  on  the  majority  read,  the 
positive  and  negative  likelihood  ratios  were  2.04  and  0.52,  respectively.    In  the  primary  analysis  the 
hazard ratio based on majority image read was 2.5. 
In  study  GE067-021  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  for  detecting  or  excluding  brain  amyloid  of  the 
blinded visual interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET images of the brain without anatomic images, 
assessed in the subgroup analysis population 3 (brain autopsy study population, n = 68) after electronic

training  of  5  independent  blinded  PET  readers,  was  counterbalanced  as  it  was  observed  in  the  same 
sample in study GE067-007 using an in-person training of another 5 different individual readers.  In fact, 
those readers showing higher sensitivities were at the same time those showing lower specificities.  
When  interpreting  PET  images  with  anatomic  images,  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  for  any  individual 
reader were not significantly different than those for the PET-only image interpretation. It seems that 
focal  atrophy  in  the  key  assessment  regions  as  found  in  study  GE067-021  may  contribute  to  false 
negative and a substantial number of diffuse plaques to false positive assessments. This is sufficiently 
covered in the SmPC as well as the updated training program.  
In the autopsied population, for the majority read, there were 3 FN cases for the majority of readers (2 had 
a neuropathology diagnosis of Lewy Body Disease (LBD), and 1 of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)) 
and 4 FP (all had  a  neuropathological  diagnosis  of  Lewy  Body  Disease (Dementia  with  Lewy  Body  or 
Parkinson’s  disease).    Therefore,  it is  possible that  a  FN  result occurs if  there is  sparse  neuritic plaque 
density; so is a FP result when there is moderate plaque density.   
TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICABILITY 
Image quality 
Following administration of the first dose of Vizamyl in study ALZ201, PET images of subjects with pAD 
were rated as excellent in 21 (84%) and good in 4 (16%) subjects, respectively. In all 20 aMCI subjects 
and 5 HVs the images were rated as excellent. Following administration of a second dose of 120 MBq of 
Vizamyl in 5 with pAD (who had also received 120 MBq as the first dose), the images were rated as good 
in all subjects (100%). 
Reader confidence 
Only data on reader confidence of the visual blinded interpretation of PET scans (both PET-only images 
and PET with anatomic images) was obtained in study GE067-021.  The percentage of PET-only images 
with a high reader confidence ranged from 61-97%, depending on the reader.  Those with low reader 
confidence ranged from <1 to 20%.  If PET images were assessed combined with anatomic images, the 
corresponding levels of reader confidence were in similar ranges. The applicant has assessed post-hoc the 
reader confidence in PET images by each of the 5 readers of pivotal GE067-007.  All readers had most of 
the PET readings categorised as the highest confidence rates 4 or 5 (92.6% for reader 1, 88.1% for reader 
2, 100% for reader 3, 80.6% for reader 4 and 80.9% for reader 5). 
Inter and intra-reader concordance 
In pivotal autopsy study GE067-007, results show high inter-reader agreement (kappa scores ranging 
from 0.76 to 0.91) of PET readers of PET-only images for all pairwise comparisons except those involving 
Reader 3, which ranged from 0.44 to 0.55 in kappa score.   Inter-reader agreement behaved similarly for 
the interpretation of PET images with anatomic images by those 5 blinded individual readers, and the 
absolute values were slightly higher than those obtained in PET-only images. 
In  the  study  GE067-015,  the  inter-reader  and  intra-reader  agreements  for  blinded  visual  PET  scan 
reading  of  HVs  were  >99%  and  100%,  respectively.    Reader  2  showed  values  of  68%  and  75%, 
respectively.  Having in mind the results from reader 3 in study GE067-007 and reader 2, doubts about 
the reproducibility of the visual reading of flutemetamol (18F) PET scans could arise.   
In study ALZ201 there was complete agreement among 5 readers (94.6%) in HVs and patients with aMCI 
and  pAD  (with  a  Fleiss  kappa  score  of  0.96)  in  70  of  74  flutemetamol  (18F) images  read  interpreted 
visually.

In study GE067-005 (aMCI subjects), the inter-reader agreements for blinded visual PET scan reading 
ranged from 77% (κ = 0.56) to 98% (κ = 0.96) between pairs of readers. The intra-reader reproducibility 
of the rereads was good, ranging from 86% to 100%. 
In the electronic training study GE067-021 recruiting different populations using different reference/truth 
standards (analysis population 4), results show high inter-reader agreement reproducibility of blinded 
visual  interpretation  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  images  of  the  brain  without  anatomic  images  for  all 
readers:  kappa=0.83.  In  a  subset  of  patients  (analysis  population  5),  there  was  high  percentage  of 
intra-reader agreement (93-100%).  Neither population 4 nor population 5 matched the population of the 
autopsy pivotal study.  Inter-reader agreement (kappa) was slightly lower for the PET+ anatomic image 
set than for PET-only set; however, the confidence intervals overlap.  Intra-reader agreement was quite 
similar between both sets.   
Test-retest reproducibility 
In  study  ALZ201,  cortical  flutemetamol  (18F)  test-retest  quantitative  PET  estimates  had  a  low 
inter-subject  variability  of  1-4%  in  pAD  subjects.  The  variability  was  lowest  in  the  occipital  cortex, 
striatum, POC, and the frontal cortex and was highest in the medial temporal cortex, subcortical white 
matter, and pons. The mean test-retest variability of all subjects and regions was excellent. 
IMPACT ON DIAGNOSTIC THINKING AND/OR PATIENT MANAGEMENT 
The  guideline  on  clinical  evaluation  of  diagnostic  agents  (CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev.  1)  that  applies  to 
flutemetamol (18F), establishes as a requirement for new diagnostic agents, that “……relevant impact on 
diagnostic  thinking  and/or  patient  management  in  the  appropriate  clinical  context  should  be 
demonstrated, if therapeutic consequences of the diagnosis obtained with a new agent are not obvious, 
or the benefit/risk balance is unclear…..”. Since this has not been demonstrated for this diagnostic agent 
the  company  was  recommended  to  perform  a  study  to  assess  the  impact  on  diagnostic  thinking  and 
patient management. 
INDICATION 
The original wording of the indication was proposed as:  
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
VIZAMYL is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for 
the visual detection of amyloid-beta neuritic plaques in the brains of adults who are being evaluated for 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD).   
A  normal  VIZAMYL  scan  indicates  sparse  to  no  neuritic  plaques  and  is  inconsistent  with  a 
neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the point of image acquisition: a normal scan reduces the likelihood 
that a patient’s condition is due to AD.  An abnormal VIZAMYL scan is indicative of moderate to frequent 
amyloid-beta  neuritic  plaques.    Neuropathological  examinations  have  shown  this  amount  of  neuritic 
plaques is present in patients with AD, but also other types of neurologic conditions as well as in older 
people with normal cognition. VIZAMYL is to be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.  
An abnormal VIZAMYL scan does not establish a diagnosis of AD. 
The safety and efficacy of VIZAMYL have not been established for predicting the development of dementia 
or other neurological conditions, or for monitoring response to therapies.” 
The  first  statement  (i.e.  “…  indicated  for  the  visual  detection  of  amyloid-beta  neuritic  plaques  in  the 
brains”)  should  be  referred  to  in  correspondence  with  the  results  on  the  technical  and  diagnostic 
performances of flutemetamol (18F) PET scan reading to estimate the amyloid neuritic plaque density, as 
assessed in a pivotal study, the re-reading study and various supportive phase II-III studies, which were 
previously discussed in this report. 
Further on the indication wording continues to say that a normal flutemetamol (18F) PET scan indicates 
sparse to no neuritic plaques.  Such criterion of normality is in line with the criteria to establish normality 
Vizamyl

of  visual  PET  reading  in  the  pivotal,  re-reading  and  supportive  phase  II-III  studies.    EMA  recently 
acknowledged in regulatory opinions that none to sparse neuritic plaque density in the area with maximal 
neuritic plaque density measured on sections of frontal, temporal or parietal cortex, is incompatible with 
a definitive diagnosis of AD. 
The  statement  that  an  abnormal  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  scan  is  indicative  of  moderate  to  frequent 
amyloid-beta neuritic plaques is in line with the criteria to establish normality of visual PET reading in the 
pivotal, re-reading and supportive phase II-III studies. 
The  wording  continues  stating  that  neuropathological  examinations  have  shown  that  moderate  to 
frequent amount of neuritic plaques is present in patients with AD, but also other types of neurologic 
conditions as well as in older people with normal cognition.  It is also stated that abnormal VIZAMYL scan 
does  not  establish  a  diagnosis  of  AD.    To  this  regard,  the  amyloid  cascade  hypothesis  suggests  that 
accumulation of Aβ is the key pathological step in the pathogenesis of AD, however, Aβ deposition is not 
the only factor of AD.  For that reason, pre-specified levels of age-related brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque 
at autopsy should be integrated with the presence of a clinical history of dementia to arrive at a diagnostic 
level of certainty with regard to AD (Mirra et al. 1991).  Beta-amyloid plaques may also be present in 
elderly  with  normal  cognition,  patients  with  MCI,  with  other  dementias  (dementia  of  Lewy  Body, 
Parkinson disease dementia), Niemann-Pick disease type C and severe brain injury. 
VIZAMYL is to be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations, and not as a stand-alone test, which 
is  acceptable.    As  this  product  is  not  to  replace  to  clinical  assessment  of  patients,  the  indication  was 
recommended to be reworded to state from the very beginning that flutemetamol (18F) should be used 
in conjunction with clinical assessment.   
The last statement of the indication (“The safety and efficacy of VIZAMYL have not been established for 
predicting the development of dementia or other neurological conditions, or for monitoring response to 
therapies”) is crucial since it may trigger decisions that patients with clinical features of AD may not be 
treated on the basis of these findings. 
Since this radiopharmaceutical has not demonstrated efficacy for any particular diagnostic objective of a 
validated  internationally-recognised  disease,  limitations  of  the  use  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  are  of 
major interest and were included in the indication wording as a cross-reference to the full information 
stated in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Taking all this into account the following revised indication has been accepted by the CHMP: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.  
Vizamyl is a radiopharmaceutical medicinal product indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
imaging of β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who 
are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  and  other  causes  of  cognitive  impairment.  Vizamyl 
should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  
A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the 
limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.” 
with the following additional wording in section 4.4. of the SmPC: 
“Limitations of use  
A  positive  scan  does  not  independently  establish  a  diagnosis  of  AD  or  other  cognitive  disorder  since 
neuritic  plaque  deposition  in  grey  matter  may  be  present  in  asymptomatic  elderly  and  some 
neurodegenerative dementias (Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson’s disease dementia).  
For the limitations of use in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), see section 5.1.

The efficacy of Vizamyl for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to therapy has not been 
established (see section 5.1).” 
and including in section 5.1. the results of 2 longitudinal studies recruiting subjects clinically diagnosed as 
aMCI, AD or cognitively normal (study ALZ201), and subjects with aMCI (study GE067-005) who were 
followed for some years to evaluate the relationship between flutemetamol (18F) imaging and changes in 
diagnostic status.   
EFFICACY IN SUBPOPULATIONS 
No efficacy subanalysis has been presented for the use of flutemetamol (18F) in patients with atypical 
presentations of AD (asymmetric, frontal variants, posterior cortical degeneration and a single positive 
abnormal region).   
The paediatric use of this radiopharmaceutical has neither been assessed nor expected.   
A product-specific waiver for paediatric studies was granted. 
Studies intended to evaluate dose adjustments in special risk patients in which the product is intended to 
be used (including at least renal impaired subjects, elderly, and, if appropriate, in those clinical settings 
excluded from the pivotal study) were not conducted.  The use of flutemetamol (18F) in renal impaired 
subjects (n=18), cardiac impaired subjects (n=9) and hepatic impaired subjects (n=1) is documented by 
the applicant.  In the pivotal autopsy study, there were 13 subjects with renal impairment and 1 patient 
with hepatic impairment.  The available data did not indicate that clinical efficacy in patients with renal 
impairment would be different than the overall efficacy; therefore, no dose adjustment will be required. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The optimal dose and the optimal time window of flutemetamol (18F) PET images, as proposed in the 
SmPC, have not been established based on dedicated studies but the methodology used to determine 
them was considered acceptable. 
PET image quality and reader confidence of the visual PET scan interpretation was high in the studied 
populations. 
The single pivotal study allowed, by comparison to the histopathology of autopsied samples in end-of-life 
patients, conclusions to be made on correlation and diagnostic performance of the visual PET scan reading 
regarding neuritic plaque density.  Recruitment of end-of-life patients, although a different population 
than the one intended for in clinical practice, permits autopsied samples of the brain to be available within 
a reasonable timeframe.   
The single pivotal trial failed to demonstrate adequate diagnostic performance since specificity was not 
analysed as a co-primary endpoint and the success criterion (i.e. a lower limit of the 95% CI of sensitivity 
being higher than 70%) was not justified as of clinical relevance.  Moreover, the actual correlation of PET 
versus  histopathology  might  be  artifacted  and  is  unknown.    For  that  reason  the  CHMP  requested  a 
well-designed re-reading study to assess all autopsied patients recruited for the pivotal autopsy study to 
support this application.   
The clinical efficacy of the visual reading of (18F) flutemetamol PET images was in the end sufficiently 
supported by the results from pivotal study GE067-007, supportive study GE067-021, and the re-reading 
study GE067-026, in which the pivotal study has been expanded to include a total of 106 patients.   A 
consistent high sensitivity (>80%), and a specificity exceeding 84% for at least 3 out of 5 readers and 
exceeding 78% for all 5 readers, was demonstrated in a larger patient population group when analysed in 
the re-reading study using the appropriate CERAD criteria.  Results of the re-reading study of the pivotal 
autopsy  study  demonstrated  an  acceptable  lower  limit  of  sensitivity  (i.e.  83.2%)  for  the  visual

assessment  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  images  on  a  subject-basis  for  excluding  moderate-frequent 
β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the most heavily affected neocortical region (based on section with 
the maximum involvement among middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and superior and middle 
temporal gyri).   
In the supportive study ALZ201 recruiting HVs and a subgroup of the intended population (subjects with 
aMCI  and  pAD),  validation  of  visual  PET  scan  reading  was  attempted  versus  the  clinical  diagnosis  at 
baseline and at a short follow-up.   
In the supportive study GE067-005, recruiting subgroup of the intended population (subjects with aMCI), 
validation of visual PET scan reading was attempted versus the clinical diagnosis at baseline and after a 
short follow-up.  It should be noted that results in both studies were not obtained versus a (reference) 
SoT  and  no  assessment  was  done  for  the  value  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of 
clinically  probable  AD  vs  other  dementia  subtypes  (non-neurodegenerative  and  non-AD  degenerative 
dementias) and of MCI vs other causes of cognitive impairment.  
The training programme for visual PET readers in clinical practice will be electronic.  In a supportive study, 
the  electronic training  programme  was  attempted  to  be  validated  in  patients with  different  diagnoses 
from previous clinical studies of flutemetamol (18F).  Diagnostic performance in the subgroup population 
from  the  autopsy  study  was  similar  to  that  in  the  pivotal  study.    High  inter-reader  agreement  was 
observed for different populations; so was for aMCI when assessing intra-reader concordance. 
Relevant impact on diagnostic thinking and/or patient management in the appropriate clinical context has 
not  been  demonstrated  for  this  diagnostic  product  which  itself  may  have  immediate  therapeutic 
implications.  No efficacy subanalysis has been presented for the use of flutemetamol (18F) in patients 
with  atypical  presentations  of  AD  (asymmetric,  frontal  variants,  posterior  cortical  degeneration  and  a 
single positive abnormal region).   
In  conclusion,  although  the  impact  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  on  diagnostic  thinking  and/or  patient 
management was not adequately assessed, the sensitivity and specificity of visual flutemetamol (18F) 
PET reading (the reading method proposed for clinical use), for estimation of beta amyloid moderate to 
frequent neuritic plaque density in the brain of end-of-life patients, could be concluded upon from the 
results of the re-reading study, the data from the pivotal study and the supportive studies. The limitations 
of the pivotal study were acknowledged but the re-reading data have shown an acceptable lower limit of 
sensitivity (of the visual assessment of flutemetamol (18F) PET images on a subject-basis) for excluding 
β-amyloid neuritic plaque deposition.   Inter- and intra-reader reproducibility of visual PET reading after 
electronic reader training in a mixed population, including the intended population, was high.   
The following post approval measures were recommended to address abovementioned issues: 
1.  The company should continue to develop and validate a quantitative PET reading methodology 
based on their product. Such a methodology will help distinguish between white and grey matter 
in PET scans and help quantify the intensity of amyloid uptake in grey matter, and as such would 
be an important tool in the practical use of the product.  
2.  The company is encouraged to perform a study to assess the impact on diagnostic thinking and 
patient  management  since  the  therapeutic  consequences  of  the  diagnosis  of  labelling  brain 
beta-amyloid  are  not  obvious.    For  the  design  of  this  study,  parallel  HTA/scientific  advice  is 
recommended. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary safety analysis is based on the comprehensive integration of data from all subjects exposed 
to any amount of flutemetamol (18F) in all studies of the clinical development programme with some 
Vizamyl

exceptions.  The investigator-sponsored phase 1 study (Report A42404) is not included in the pooled 
safety analysis due to the study design. 
Patient exposure 
The safety database for flutemetamol (18F) contained safety data from 10 clinical studies sponsored by 
GE Healthcare and conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Vizamyl in PET imaging to detect 
fibrillar amyloid β, in the form of neuritic plaques, in the brain.  The primary safety analysis is based on the 
comprehensive integration of data from all subjects exposed to any amount of Vizamyl in the 10 studies 
(see table 20).

b Flutemetamol F 18 Injection. 
A total of 761 subjects received Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.  The recommended dose of Flutemetamol 
F 18  Injection  is  a  single  intravenous  injection  of  185 MBq.    The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  clinical 
development  program  received  this  regimen.        However,  different  nominal  doses  were  allowed  in  4 
studies.   
Across all 761 subjects in the Safety Analysis Set, the mean (SD) net activity administered was 219.3 
(76.2) MBq, ranging from 93.4 to 403.3 MBq, with a median of 183.5 MBq.  Most subjects (530, 70%) 
received a dose of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection of ≥166.5 to 203.5 MBq (185 MBq ±10%); 154 (20%) 
received ≥333 to 407 MBq (370 MBq ± 10%), 32 (4%) received ≥203.5 to 333 MBq, and the remaining 
45 (6%) of subjects received a dose <166.5 MBq. 
Mean (SD) age overall was 62 (21.24) years, ranging from 18 to 98 years.  Of the 761 subjects in clinical 
studies of flutemetamol (18F), 447 (59%) were 65 and over, while 246 (32%) were 75 and over.  In total, 
367 subjects (48%) were male and 394 (52%) were female.  Most were White (693, 91%); 33 (4%) were 
Black and 27 (4%) were Asian.  Mean (SD) height overall was 167.3 (10.31) cm, ranging from 137 to 197 
cm.  Mean (SD) weight overall was 73.1 (17.38) kg, ranging from 26.8 to 156.0 kg.  Mean (SD) body 
mass index (BMI) overall was 26.1 (5.30) kg/m2, ranging from 12 to 58 kg/m2. 
A total of 113 subjects (15%) took at least 1 prior medication.  The most common ATC Level 1 category 
of  drugs  taken  as  prior  medication  was  nervous  system  medications  (45  subjects,  6%),  followed  by 
alimentary  tract  and  metabolism  (27  subjects,  4%)  and  musculoskeletal  system  medications  (25 
subjects, 3%). 
A  total  of  509  subjects  (67%)  took  concomitant  medications.    The  most  common  ATC  primary 
classification levels of drugs taken as concomitant medication were: nervous system medications (343 
subjects, 45%), alimentary tract and metabolism medications (321 subjects, 42%), and cardiovascular 
system (298 subjects, 39%). 
Few subjects took prior or concomitant sedatives.  Lorazepam was the most common prior (4 subjects, 
1%) and concomitant (50 subjects, 7%) sedative taken.  The next most common concomitant sedatives 
taken  were  alprazolam  (23  subjects,  3%),  temazepam  (20  subjects,  3%),  and  zolpidem  tartrate  (13 
subjects, 2%).  All other sedatives were taken by ≤ 1% of subjects. 
Adverse events 
In  total,  151  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  for  76  subjects  (10%);  AEs  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  at  least  possibly  related  to  Flutemetamol  F 18  Injection  were  reported  for  44 
subjects (6%) (table 21).

eThis event was reported as “feeling of arrhythmia” and thus should have been coded as “palpitations”. It is treated as such in the 
SmPC. 
Most of the non-serious AEs were mild to moderate and resolved without treatment.   
AEs that led to discontinuation of the study drug were reported for 3 subjects (<0.5%).  One subject (in 
study ALZ201) was discontinued due to mild extravasation not related to Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.  
The two other subjects presented the following AEs of moderate intensity and resolved in ≤12 minutes: 
chest discomfort, abdominal discomfort, arrhythmia (reported as feeling of arrhythmia; see below), and 
hypotonia were reported for 1 subject (in study GE067-015), and dyspepsia, dyspnea, and  hypotonia 
were reported for the other (in study GE067-015).   
The system organ most frequently affected by AEs were nervous system disorders (22 subjects, 3%), 
vascular  disorders  (21  subjects,  3%),  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (19 
subjects, 2%). 
AE types reported for ≥8 subjects (1%) were: flushing (16 subjects, 2%), blood pressure increased (10 
subjects, 1%), headache (10 subjects, 1%), dizziness (8 subjects, 1%), and nausea (8 subjects, 1%).   
Flushing  was  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  Flutemetamol  F 18  Injection  for  all  16 
subjects; it was of mild intensity for 14 subjects and moderate for 2 subjects.   
• 
•  Blood pressure increased was considered at least possibly related to Flutemetamol F 18 Injection 
for 7 of the 10 subjects; it was mild for 8 subjects and moderate for 2.   
•  Headache was considered at least possibly related to Flutemetamol F 18 Injection for 5 of the 10 
subjects; it was mild for 8, moderate for 1, and severe for 1 subject.   
•  Dizziness was considered at least possibly related for 6 of the 8 subjects; it was mild for 6 subjects 
and moderate for 2.   
•  Nausea was considered at least possibly related for 6 of the 8 subjects; it was mild for 7 subjects 
and moderate for 1.   
A total of 13 subjects had AEs of blood pressure increased or hypertension.  Of the 13 cases, 5 were male 
and 8 were female.  Nine cases were mild and 4 were moderate in intensity.  Five were related, 3 were 
possibly related, 4 were unlikely related, and 1 was not related.  The subject had a history of hypertension 
in 7 cases.  In no case was treatment given.   
Most AEs of flushing occurred shortly after injection, and most cases occurred in women.  No other risk 
factors for predicting flushing were identified.  Based on other AEs that occurred along with flushing in 
some cases, the flushing may have been related to histamine release, possibly related to polysorbate 80.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs  were  reported  for  5  subjects  (1%):  anemia  (Study  GE067-007),  anaphylactic  reaction  (Study 
GE067-005),  back  pain  and  headache  (Study  GE067-005),  prostate  cancer  (Study  GE067-007),  and 
senile  dementia  (Study  GE067-007).    The  SAE  anaphylactic  reaction  was  considered  related  to 
investigational medicinal product (IMP); no other SAE was considered to be related to Flutemetamol F 18 
Injection. All other SAEs resolved and the subjects recovered.  Prostate cancer and senile dementia had 
fatal outcomes but were not considered related to Flutemetamol F 18 Injection. The other severe AEs 
resolved and the subjects all recovered. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical  laboratory  investigations,  vital  signs,  ECG  and  physicial  and  neurological  examinations  were 
evaluated.  The changes from baseline in those parameters were not considered to be of clinical concern 
or  to  warrant  any  Warnings,  Precautions,  or  Contraindications  for  Flutemetamol  F  18  Injection.    The 
following cases of AEs were considered related to flutemetamol (18F): 
•  One subject (Study GE067-008) had a mild AE of blood glucose decreased; the event resolved 
without treatment and the subject recovered.  
•  One subject (Study GE067-005) had a moderately intense AE of blood lactate dehydrogenase 
increased; no resolution date or time was reported.  No treatment was given.   
•  One  subject in  Study  GE067-015  had  mild  neutrophil  count  increased.    This  subject  also  had 
nausea and swelling face.    
•  13 subjects had AEs of blood pressure increased or hypertension. 
• 
Three  subjects  (one  in  Study  Ge067-005  and  two  in  Study  GE067-015)  had  mild  AEs  of 
palpitations, all events resolved, and all subjects recovered.  
•  One subject in Stutdy GE067-015 had a mild AE of hyperventilation that began 1 minute after 
dosing and lasted 1 minute.  This subject also had the AE of feeling hot.  
•  One subject in Study GE067-005 had a moderate AE of respiratory rate increased that began 
immediately after dosing and lasted 3 hours 18 minutes.  It was not treated.   
•  One subject in Study GE067-015 had mild dyspnea that began 1 minute after injection and lasted 
one minute without treatment.  This subject also had back pain. Another subject in GE067-015 
had moderate dyspnea that started 2 minutes after injection and resolved in 10 minutes with 
oxygen 
Safety in special populations 
Subpopulation  analyses  were  conducted  to  look  for  any  differential  safety  effects  related  to  the  NPH 
status, gender, age, race, ethnicity, sedative use, baseline serum creatinine level and for the status of 
normal pressure hydrocephalus.  
The percentages of subjects with AEs and related AEs among NPH subjects are compared with the overall 
population.  The differences in safety are not considered to be of clinical significance; however, caution 
should be exercised because of the small number of NPH subjects recruited. 
AEs  reported  for  ≥8  (1%)  of  subjects  (flushing,  blood  pressure  increased/hypertension,  headache, 
dizziness, and nausea) are discussed for the overall safety population by demographic subgroups (Age, 
Gender, Race, and Ethnicity).  Caution should be exercised in interpreting these results because of the 
small number of NPH subjects.

AE data by sedative use showed that the headache rate was not related to sedative use.  Dizziness was 
less  frequent  among  sedative  users  (0%  vs.  3%),  as  was  flushing  (1%  vs.  2%).    Nausea  and  blood 
pressure increased/hypertension were more frequent among sedative users (3% vs. 2% for each).   
Only nausea had a higher frequency among subjects with high baseline levels of serum creatinine (6% vs. 
1% and 0%). Caution should be exercised in interpreting these results because of the small numbers of 
events (only 18 subjects had elevated serum creatinine at baseline). 
Of the 761 subjects in clinical studies of flutemetamol (18F), 447 (59%) were 65 and over, while 246 
(32%) were 75 and over.  No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and 
younger  subjects,  and  other  reported  clinical  experience  has  not  identified  differences  in  responses 
between the elderly and younger patients. Selective vulnerability in the likely target population of older 
individuals is not expected.  
No  analysis  of  subjects  with  altered  hepatic  function  (i.e.  elevated  serum  liver  enzymes)  has  been 
performed  to  check  any  discernible  differences  in  AEs  or  lab  values  versus  those  with  normal-range 
hepatic parameters.   The rate of the brain uptake of flutemetamol (18F) (which is a necessary step for 
efficacy) is rapid compared to the rate of elimination by either the hepatic or renal routes. Therefore, 
there is no effect on dose and no need for dose adjustment for renal or hepatic impairment.  There is no 
evidence of a safety concern in renal and hepatic impairment. 
Flutemetamol (18F) is not expected to be used in women of child-bearing potential. 
Immunological events 
The following adverse reactions may occur as symptoms and signs of a hypersensitivity reaction to 
VIZAMYL or any of its excipients: eye swelling, pallor, dyspnoea, throat irritation, vomiting, rash, pruritus, 
skin tightness, swelling face. 
One anaphylactoid reaction was observed in the clinical development program of flutemetamol (18F). It 
was possibly related to the polysorbate 80 contained in the formulation. With 761 subjects exposed to 
flutemetamol (18F) in the development program to date, the anaphylactoid reaction rate was 
approximately 0.13%.  
The risk of this reaction was managed in the clinical development program by excluding subjects with 
known or suspected hypersensitivity to any component of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.  Following 
approval of the product, the risk will be managed by appropriate labeling text that will contraindicate use 
of the product in patients with known/suspected hypersensitivity to any component of the product.  In 
addition, appropriate text will be included in the Warnings and Precautions sections of the labeling to 
advise users of the possibility of this reaction and to recommended immediate availability of emergency 
equipment and personnel trained in its use should a similar reaction occur. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  clinical  studies  to  investigate  interactions  that  may  affect  safety  have  been  performed  for 
Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.  Nevertheless, a logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine if 
use of an AD medication was associated with an increased risk of having an adverse event.  AE occurrence 
(yes/no) was the dependent variable and AD concomitant medication use (yes/no) was the independent 
variable.  Of 761 subjects who received any dose of Flutemetamol (18F) Injection, 152 (20%) reported 
use  of  one  or  more  AD  concomitant  medications  (donepezil,  donepezil  hydrochloride,  galantamine, 
galantamine hydrobromide, memantine, memantine hydrochloride, or rivastigmine).  The AE rate among

patients on AD medications was 21/152 (14%), and the AE rate among patients not on those medications 
was 55/609 (9%).  Although the AE rate was numerically higher among AD medication users, the use of 
one or more AD medications was not a significant factor in the logistic regression analysis (p = 0.0897). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events that led to discontinuation of the study drug were reported for 3 subjects (<0.5%).  One 
subject (Study ALZ201) was discontinued due to mild extravasation not related to flutemetamol (18F). 
Two  other  subjects  for  whom  the  study  drug  was    discontinued  due  to  TEAEs  considered  related  to 
flutemetamol  (18F);  chest  discomfort,  abdominal  discomfort,  arrhythmia  (reported  as  feeling  of 
arrhythmia; see below), and hypotonia were reported for 1 subject (Study GE067-015), and dyspepsia, 
dyspnea,  and  hypotonia  were  reported  for  the  other  (Study  GE067-015).    Both  of  these  TEAEs  were 
moderate in intensity, and both resolved in ≤12 minutes. 
A subject in Study GE067-015 presented with symptomatology which was not clearly indicative for an 
anaphylactoid reaction. 
Dosimetry and radiation protection 
The human radiation dosimetry of flutemetamol (18F) has been studied in two PK studies (the European 
study  with  Caucasian  population  ALZ103  and  the  Japanese  study  GE067-014  which  were  detailed  in 
section ”Pharmacokinetics”).   The estimated absorbed radiation doses for adults following intravenous 
injection  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  from  study  ALZ103  are  shown  in  the  table  22  below.    Values  were 
calculated assuming emptying of the urinary bladder at 3.5-hour intervals and human biodistribution data 
using OLINDA/EXM software.

The  SmPC  includes  specifications  related  to  radiation  protection  in  the  context  of  manipulation  and 
elimination  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  by  healthcare  professionals,  and  radiation  protection  for  the 
family. 
Pregnancy and breast feeding were exclusion criteria in all clinical trials so Flutemetamol F 18 Injection 
has not been studied in pregnant women.  No embryonic or fetal toxicity studies to assess radioactive 
exposure  have  been  conducted.    No  cases  of  pregnancy  following  exposure  to  Flutemetamol  F  18 
Injection have been reported to the Sponsor as of 31 July 2012.  It is anticipated that a large fraction, if 
not the majority, of women in whom Flutemetamol F 18 Injection may be used after approval will not be 
of childbearing potential; therefore, the probability of a pregnant women receiving Flutemetamol F 18 
injection is considered low.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  overall  number  of  patients  exposed  to  flutemetamol  (18F)  in  the  clinical  trials  sponsored  by  the 
company is small (n= 761), particularly considering the prevalence of AD in the general population. No 
post-marketing data is available since no marketing authorization had been issued in the world until the 
start date of this application procedure.   
Vizamyl  
EMA/546752/2014

The majority of subjects in the clinical development program received the dose recommended in clinical 
practice (i.e. 185 MBq) except the subjects in 4 studies: started at 100 MBq and increased to 185 MBq in 
the 2 Phase 1 studies in pAD and HVs (ALZ103 and GE067-014), 7 pAD subjects in the Phase 2 study 
[ALZ201] who received 2 doses of 120 MBq (3.2 mCi) of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection, and in the Phase 3 
brain autopsy study [GE067-007], which enrolled subjects ≥55 years of age who were at the end-of-life, 
that  the  dose  range  was  increased  to  allow  up  to  370  MBq.  Overall,  the  sample  exposed  to  a  single 
administration of flutemetamol (18F) in the safety database is 295 with cognitive impairment (pAD and 
aMCI). 
Flutemetamol  (18F)  was  generally  well  tolerated.    Related  AEs  were  reported  in  44  subjects  (6%).  
Flushing was a common related AEs (n=16) and occurring mostly in women.  Other related AES occurring 
in less than 1% subjects were blood pressure increased (n=7), headache (n=5), dizziness (n=6) and 
nausea (n=6) and hypertension (n=3).  Hypersensitivity reaction to Vizamyl or any of its excipients has 
also been reported.   
Only few serious adverse events have been reported (n=5), and only one severe anaphylactic reaction 
was considered related to the study drug.  No deaths were attributed to flutemetamol (18F). 
The  changes  from  baseline  in  clinical  laboratory  investigations,  vital  signs,  ECG  and  physicial  and 
neurological  examinations  were  not  considered  to  be  of  clinical  concern  or  to  warrant  any  Warnings, 
Precautions, or Contraindications for Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.    
The differences in safety in any subpopulation related to NPH, gender, race, ethnicity and sedative use are 
not considered to be of clinical significance.  No clinical studies were performed in subpopulations related 
to  the  concomitant  use  of  AD  medications.  Although  the  AE  rate  was  numerically  higher  among  AD 
medication users, the use of one or more AD medications was not a significant factor. 
Selective vulnerability in the likely target population of older individuals is not expected. There is no effect 
on dose and no need for dose adjustment for renal or hepatic impairment.  There is no evidence of a 
safety concern in renal and hepatic impairment. 
There were 2 cases of discontinuation due to AEs related to flutemetamol (18F)  
The human radiation dosimetry of flutemetamol (18F) yields an effective dose of 0.032 mSv/MBq. It is in 
the range of other approved radiopharmaceuticals. 
Specifications  related  to  radiation  protection  in  the  context  of  manipulation  and  elimination  of  the 
radiopharmaceutical by healthcare professionals, and radiation protection for the family, are appropriate 
to  be  included  in  the  SmPC  and  in  accordance  with  those  approved  for  other  fluorine  (18F) 
radiopharmaceuticals. 
The safety for repeated injections cannot be concluded upon due to the low number of patients exposed 
within a short time period. 
There are no safety effects concerning age as well as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. 
The specifications of use of this radiopharmaceutical in pregnancy were drafted in line with the EMA core 
SmPC for radiopharmaceuticals. Flutemetamol (18F) is not expected to be used in women of child-bearing 
potential. 
The paediatric use of flutemetamol (18F) cannot be recommended, and is not expected. A full waiver to 
perform paediatric investigations was granted.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although,  flutemetamol  (18F)  has  been  studied  in  a  limited  number  of  patients  (safety  population  of 
completed  clinical  trials  n=761),  overall,  there  were  no  significant  safety  signals  identified  with 
flutemetamol (18F) PET imaging.   
The paediatric use of flutemetamol (18F) is not recommended.  There are no safety effects concerning 
age as well as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In clinical practice, the presence of pre-specified levels of age-related brain β-amyloid neuritic plaque 
density at autopsy, in the presence of clinical history of dementia, confirms the diagnosis of AD.  However, 
this  definitive  diagnosis  can  only  be  achieved  post-mortem.The  ante-mortem  diagnosis  of  AD  in 
demented patients relies solely on well-accepted standardised clinical criteria with limited sensitivity and 
specificity.  This clearly shows the high need for better diagnostic procedures for AD in vivo. 
In the diagnostic process in AD radiopharmaceuticals are used for imaging β-amyloid neuritic plaques in 
the context that a negative PET scan is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD, while a positive PET scan 
does  not  independently  establish  a  diagnosis  of  AD  or  other  cognitive  disorder,  since  neuritic  plaque 
deposition in grey matter may be present in asymptomatic elderly and some other neurodegenerative 
dementias. Flutemetamol (18F) is a novel radiopharmaceutical which has been developed for imaging of 
β-amyloid neuritic plaques by PET in the brain of adults who are being evaluated for AD. For flutemetamol 
(18F), the diagnostic performance was evaluated versus the histopathological diagnosis at autopsy of the 
β-amyloid deposition in the pivotal study GE067-007, and versus the established clinical diagnosis in two 
supportive studies.   
Diagnostic performance was the primary focus of the pivotal efficacy study GE067-007. Results from the 
primary analysis achieved the pre-specified study objective: sensitivity was 81% (67-92%) for reader 1, 
88% (74-96%) for reader 2, 93% (81-99%) for reader 3, 93% (81-99%) for reader 4 and 88% (75-96%) 
for  reader  5.  The  ability  to  correctly  differentiate  between  brain  regions  with  and  without  β-amyloid 
deposition by using visual assessments of regional flutemetamol (18F) uptake in co-registered PET based 
on autopsy data thus clearly exceeded the respective target value of 70% for the majority of the readers.  
In the re-reading study of the pivotal study (which expanded studied population up to 106 patients), the 
visual subject-level assessment of flutemetamol (18F) PET images (which is the one recommended in 
clinical  practice)  showed  sensitivity  of  91.9%  (95%CI:  83.2  –  97%)  of  the  majority  read  versus  the

neuropathological diagnosis according to CERAD criteria, clearly exceeding the target value for sensitivity 
in the pivotal study.  
Flutemetamol (18F) estimates with a high likelihood the beta-amyloid deposition, and therefore provides 
valuable additional information that although not yet included in the current clinical diagnostic standard of 
AD,  can  be  useful.    In  the  current  status  of  lack  of  reliable  and  validated  biomarkers  and  the 
non-feasibility of biopsies, this kind of accurate information on amyloid burden is not available by using 
any other approach apart from the use of PET radiopharmaceuticals for beta-amyloid imaging (which, 
when achieving a reasonable level of sensitivity on a subject-level basis, can exclude a diagnosis of AD).  
Moreover,  information  on  amyloid  burden  is  made  available  for  the  physician  at  a  time  when  this 
information may still be useful for making decisions about patient management. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
It has not been clearly elucidated in vivo how and which of the different types of beta-amyloid and other 
relevant structures are traced or not by flutemetamol (18F) in the brain. This will help assessing how 
useful/misleading  tracing  them  might  be  for  efficacy  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  in  the  proposed 
indication. In the pivotal autopsy study, correlation between in vivo flutemetamol (18F) uptake values 
and the quantitative levels of amyloid deposition at autopsy might be artifacted and is uncertain.   
Flutemetamol  (18F)  is  not  a  stand-alone  diagnostic  tool,  and  needs  to  be  used  in  conjunction  with  a 
clinical evaluation. 
Flutemetamol (18F) is proposed not only as a marker of β-amyloid deposition in the brain, but also for 
diagnostic purposes of AD in patients with cognitive impairment. The data on sensitivity and specificity of 
the  visual  reading  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  uptake  in  pAD  and  aMCI  subjects  in  supportive  studies 
ALZ201  and  GE067-005  are  handicapped  by  the  limitations  of  the  clinical  diagnostic  criteria  used  as 
standard.    Moreover,  no  assessment  was  done  for  the  value  of  flutemetamol  (18F)  in  the  differential 
diagnosis of clinical pAD versus other dementia subtypes, and of aMCI versus other causes of cognitive 
impairment. 
In addition, there is no compelling evidence from longitudinal long-term phase III trials in the intended 
population  to  confirm  that  flutemetamol  (18F)  allows  either  for  confirmation  of  AD  pathology  or  for 
exclusion  of  AD  in  combination  with  other  diagnostic  evaluations.    This  involves  differential  diagnosis 
between AD and the most common non-AD dementias likely to be confused with AD (including Lewy body 
dementia, vascular dementia and some cases of frontotemporal dementia), and diagnosis of AD in those 
circumstances  of  particular  uncertainty  such  as  early  stages  of  the  disease  or  atypical  presentations 
(asymmetric, frontal variants, posterior cortical degeneration, and a single positive abnormal region).  
For flutemetamol (18F), very limited data were submitted in MCI patients where the diagnostic test would 
be the most useful (only 19 MCI patients from study ALZ201, and 232 in study GE067-005 assessed for 
their conversion rate to probable AD over a short 3-year follow-up period).  No relevant data for predicting 
development of AD or monitoring response to therapy have been provided for flutemetamol (18F). 
Actual impact of flutemetamol (18F) PET on diagnostic thinking and/or patient management has not been 
demonstrated.    Further  to  this  it  remains  unclear  whether  a  tangible  benefit  for  the  patients  can  be 
expected from a change in patient management that follows a positive result.  Nowadays, in the absence 
of disease modifying treatments for AD: 
• 
• 
The clinical benefit to the patient brought by early AD diagnosis is unclear 
In false negative cases, omitting/delaying treatment is not crucial, and flutemetamol (18F) would 
not  avoid  other  diagnostic  tests  (eg.  MRI,  CT,  blood  tests,  etc.)  since  they  are  generally 
performed  before  PET  to  exclude  non-neurodegenerative  dementias  when  a  suspicion  of  AD 
exists. 
As  therapeutic  consequences  of  the  diagnosis  of  labeling  brain  β-amyloid  are  not  obvious,  it  is 
recommended to perform a study to assess the impact on diagnostic thinking and patient management.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Although the exposure to flutemetamol (18F) is limited, there were no significant safety signals identified 
with  flutemetamol  (18F)  PET  imaging.    From  clinical  studies,  the  most  frequently  reported  treatment 
related adverse events were flushing, increased blood pressure, headache, dizziness and nausea. 
Exposure to flutemetamol (18F) implies radiation exposure of the patient, but it is in the range of other 
approved radiopharmaceuticals, and is acceptable. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
False positive findings in the detection of beta amyloid deposition, with the possible consequence of a 
wrong  diagnosis  of  MCI/AD  (and  its  consequences),  cannot  be  excluded.  The  impact  of  reader’s 
subjectivity on the subjective interpretation of flutemetamol (18F) PET images was obvious even in the 
controlled setting of the clinical trials, and could not be completely eliminated by training.  It is unknown 
what extent of either inter-reader variability or of individual readers with a high rate of wrong readings 
must be expected in a “real world setting” regardless of any training provided.  Similarly, it is unclear to 
what extent any success reached of the reader’s training in the clinical trials may be representative for the 
effect of a training of users post-marketing. 
Whereas the radiation exposure appears acceptable, a futher minimization might be possible.  However, 
as dose-finding studies of flutemetamol (18F) were not performed, it is not clear whether a lower dose 
might have been used with the same imaging quality. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Disease  modifying  treatment  in  any  non-degenerative  dementia  syndrome  and  treatments  for  early 
intervention to prevent widespread and irreversible neuropathological changes are still not available, and 
that is why the applicanion of radiopharmaceuticals in the diagnostic context for these diseases raises 
questions  on  their  practical  usage.    Still,  Vizamyl  is  a  non-invasive  method  for  visualization  and 
neuroanatomical localization of β-amyloid deposition in the brain ante-mortem, and as such its potential 
value  in  the  diagnostic  approach  of  AD  (for  differential  diagnosis,  early  diagnosis,  other  diagnostic 
purposes) is of paramount importance.   
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Until recently, histopathological methods in autopsied samples were the only available tool to estimate 
β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brain.  The ability of PET radiopharmaceuticals to estimate such 
density while the patient is still alive is considered a significant improvement in the diagnostic procedures 
for  adult  patients  who  are  being  evaluated  for  AD  and  other  causes  of  cognitive  impairment.    In  this 
sense,  the  presence  of  scarce  to  no  β-amyloid  neuritic  plaques  in  the  brain  is  not  compatible  with  a 
diagnosis of AD. A positive scan result, however, does not confirm the diagnosis of AD since there might 
be  β-amyloid  deposition  in  the  brain  in  asymptomatic  elderly  subjects  and  patients  with  other 
neurodegenerative dementias. The availability of a product that can identify with a high sensitivity and 
specificity  the  presence  and  absence  of  β  -amyloid  neuritic  plaques  in  the  brain  is  of  paramount 
importance.

The safety profile of flutemetamol (18F) is reassuring, although the risk of false positive readings remains 
and these in theory may result in the wrong diagnosis of AD.  Appropriate tools to minimize false positive 
readings are proposed and they include: an appropriate training programme, a restriction of the use of 
flutemetamol (18F) to its intended use, ensuring that flutemetamol (18F) PET scans are perceived as an 
additional diagnostic tool rather than the source of an all-overruling medical truth, and tools for 
addressing the inter-reader variability and possible user non-compliance. 
There are still a few issues that remain open like the impact of flutemetamol (18F) PET use on diagnostic 
behaviour,  the  quantitative  correlation  between  in  vivo  quantitative  values  of  brain  uptake  of 
flutemetamol  (18F)  and  levels  of  amyloid  deposition  at  autopsy,  and  the  fact  that  in  the  submitted 
supportive trials in the intended population, sensitivity and specificity of flutemetamol (18F) has not been 
firmly established for the initial diagnosis of AD or exclusion of AD pathology vs accepted gold standard. 
Despite the abovementioned issues, the data on the sensitivity and specificity of flutemetamol (18F) for 
detecting  the  presence  of  moderate  to  frequent  β-amyloid  neuritic  plaque  density  in  the  brain  are 
convincing.    The  additional  data  submitted  from  the  re-reading  of  the  pivotal  autopsy  study  have 
convincingly  shown  an  acceptable  lower  limit  of  sensitivity  (of  the  visual  assessment  of  flutemetamol 
(18F) PET images on a subject-basis) for excluding β-amyloid deposition. 
Flutemetamol (18F) estimates with a high likelihood the beta-amyloid deposition, and therefore provides 
valuable additional information that although not yet included in the current clinical diagnostic standard of 
AD, is made available for the physician at a time when this information may still be useful for making 
decisions on patient management.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus  that 
the risk-benefit balance of flutemetamol (18F) in the  indication: 
“This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.  
Vizamyl is a radiopharmaceutical medicinal product indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
imaging of β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who 
are  being  evaluated  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  and  other  causes  of  cognitive  impairment.  Vizamyl 
should be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  
A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the 
limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.”

The safety and efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in children from birth to less than 2 years of age has not 
been established. No data are available.  
Method of administration  
For intramuscular injection only.  
The preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Young children with 
insufficient deltoid mass should be vaccinated in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  
The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be 
mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. 
For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible 
trace residues such as beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and polysorbate 80. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved.  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with all injectable vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with 
thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular 
administration. 
General 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient 
to prevent influenza. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. 
Excipients with known effect 
Sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.  
Potassium 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with Flucelvax Tetra. There are no data available on co-
administration of Flucelvax Tetra with other vaccines. Based on clinical experience with cell-based 
trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), Flucelvax Tetra can be given at the same time as other vaccines. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Inactivated influenza vaccines, such as Flucelvax Tetra, can be given in any stage of pregnancy. 
Larger safety datasets are available on vaccine use during the second or third trimester, compared with 
the first trimester; however, data from worldwide use of influenza vaccines do not indicate any 
adverse foetal and maternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine. 
A prospective Pregnancy Exposure Registry was conducted in the United States (US) and data were 
collected from 665 women vaccinated with Flucelvax Tetra during 3 Northern Hemisphere influenza 
seasons (2017-18 to 2019-20), of whom 28% were exposed during their first trimester. Based on 
pregnancy outcomes and predefined infant safety outcomes, there was no evidence of adverse foetal, 
newborn or pregnancy outcomes attributable to the vaccine during any stage of pregnancy.  
There have been no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with Flucelvax Tetra. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicology data from cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) 
do not predict an increased risk of developmental abnormalities. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Flucelvax Tetra is excreted in human milk. No effects on breastfed 
newborn/infant are anticipated. Flucelvax Tetra may be given during lactation. 
Fertility 
No human fertility data are available. Animal data, with cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), 
have not shown effects on female fertility. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Flucelvax Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects

The safety of Flucelvax Tetra in adults 18 years and older was evaluated in a randomised, controlled 
study (V130_01), in which 1 334 subjects received Flucelvax Tetra. Similar rates of solicited local and 
systemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based 
trivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical study. 
The most commonly reported (≥10%) reactions in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra were pain at 
the injection site (34%), headache (14%), fatigue (14%), myalgia (14%), erythema (13%) and 
induration (10%). 
The  incidence  of  some  adverse  reactions  were  considerably  lower  among  subjects  ≥ 65 years  of  age 
when compared to subjects 18 to < 65 years of age (see table below).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common 
(≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), not known (cannot be estimated

Paediatric population (2 to less than 18 years of age) 
The safety of Flucelvax Tetra in children 2 to less than 18 years of age has been evaluated in two 
clinical studies, V130_03 and V130_12. In the randomised, controlled study V130_03,  1 159 
paediatric subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (584 subjects 9 to <18 years; 575 subjects 4 to <9 years). 
Children 9 to less than 18 years of age received a single dose of Flucelvax Tetra. Children 4 to less 
than 9 years of age received one or two doses (separated by 4 weeks) of Flucelvax Tetra based on 
determination of the subject’s prior influenza vaccination history. In this age group, 235 paediatric 
subjects received one dose and 340 subjects received two doses. Similar rates of solicited local and 
systemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based 
trivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical study. 
In the multinational, randomised, observer-blind study V130_12, the safety population included a total 
of 2 255 children 2 to less than 18 years of age who received Flucelvax Tetra (580 subjects 2 to < 6 
years; 564 subjects 6 to < 9 years; 1 111 subjects 9 to < 18 years). Children 9 to less than 18 years of 
age received a single dose of Flucelvax Tetra. Children 2 to less than 9 years of age received one or 
two doses (separated by 28 days) of Flucelvax Tetra based on determination of the subject’s prior 
influenza vaccination history.

The most common local and systemic adverse reactions reported in either study is described below by 
paediatric sub-group. 
The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after one dose reported in paediatric 
subjects of 9 to < 18 years of age were injection site pain (58%), headache (22%), erythema (19%), 
fatigue (18%), myalgia (16%), and induration (15%).  
The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 6 to 
less than 9 years of age were pain at the injection site (61%), injection site erythema (25%), injection 
site induration (19%), fatigue (16%), headache (16%) and injection site ecchymosis (11%).  
The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 2 to 
less than 6 years of age were tenderness at the injection site (54%), injection site erythema (23%), 
sleepiness (21%), irritability (19%), injection site induration (15%), change in eating habits (14%) and 
injection site ecchymosis (11%).  
Compared to adults 18 years of age and older, paediatric subjects generally reported higher rates of local 
and systemic adverse reactions. 
In children who received a second dose of Flucelvax Tetra the incidence of adverse reactions following 
the second dose of vaccine was similar or slightly lower to that observed with the first dose. 
The frequency of adverse reactions in children 2 to less and 18 years of age in these clinical studies are 
described in Table 2 below.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There are no data for overdose with Flucelvax Tetra. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital 
functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 
Mechanism of action 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Flucelvax Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and 
two B types) contained in the vaccine. Flucelvax Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the 
haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. 
Flucelvax Tetra is manufactured using Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. 
Specific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated 
influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human 
studies, antibody titres of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in 
up to 50% of subjects. 
Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. 
Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new 
antigenic variant of the same type or subtype.  
Annual revaccination with current influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines 
during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to 
year. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Adults 18 years of age and older 
Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in adults 18 years of age and older in a randomised, 
double-blind, controlled study (V130_01). In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1334) 
or one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c 
(N = 677) or TIV2c (N = 669)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed, 
21 days after vaccination. 
The immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) of haemagglutination 
inhibition (HI) antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions, defined 
as a pre-vaccination HI titre of <1:10 with a post vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre-vaccination HI 
titre of ≥10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in serum HI antibody titre. 
Flucelvax Tetra was non-inferior to TIVc. Non-inferiority was established for all 4 influenza strains 
included in Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs and the differences in the percentages of 
subjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following vaccination. The antibody response to 
influenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to the antibody response after 
vaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate lineage. There was no 
evidence that the addition of the second influenza B strain resulted in immune interference to other 
strains included in the vaccine. 
Age subgroup analyses in subjects 18 to less than 65 years of age and 65 years of age and above 
confirmed that HI antibody responses (GMT and differences in vaccine group seroconversion rates) 
met non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria 3 weeks following vaccination for all 4 influenza strains 
in both age groups. 
The non-inferiority data observed are summarised in Table 3.

Clinical efficacy of cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) against culture-confirmed influenza 
in adults 
The efficacy experience with TIVc is relevant to Flucelvax Tetra because both vaccines are 
manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.  
A multinational, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study (V58P13) was performed to 
assess clinical efficacy and safety of TIVc during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults aged 18 to 
less than 50 years. A total of 11,404 subjects were enrolled to receive TIVc (N = 3828), Agrippal 
(N = 3676) or placebo (N = 3900) in a 1:1:1 ratio.  
TIVc efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness 
caused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases 
were identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined 
according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral 
temperature ≥100.0°F / 38°C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab 
samples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral 
strains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were 
calculated (Table 4).

Paediatric population  
Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Children and Adolescents 4 to less than 18 Years of Age 
Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in children 4 to less than 18 years of age as part of a 
randomised, double-blind, controlled study (V130_03). In this study, subjects received Flucelvax 
Tetra (N = 1 159) or one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine 
(TIVc) [TIV1c (N = 593), or TIV2c (N = 580)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens 
was assessed 21 days after vaccination. 
The immunogenicity endpoints were GMTs of HI antibodies response and percentage of subjects who 
achieved seroconversions (seroconversion rate), defined as a pre-vaccination HI titre of <1:10 with a 
post-vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre-vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in 
serum HI antibody titre. 
Flucelvax Tetra was noninferior to TIVc in children 4 to less than 18 years of age. Non-inferiority was 
established for all 4 influenza strains included in the Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs 
and the differences in the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following 
vaccination. The antibody response to influenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to 
the antibody response after vaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate 
lineage. There was no evidence that the addition of the second B strain resulted in immune 
interference to other strains included in the vaccine. 
The immunogenicity data in subjects 4 to less than 18 years of age are summarised in Table 5.

 Clinical efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in the paediatric population 2 to less than 18 years of age 
Absolute efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in children 2 to less than 18 years of age in Study 
V130_12. This was a multinational, randomised, non-influenza vaccine comparator-controlled 
efficacy study conducted in 8 countries over 3 influenza seasons, in which 4 514 subjects were 
enrolled to received 0.5 ml of Flucelvax Tetra or a non-influenza comparator in a 1:1 ratio. Based on 
influenza vaccination history, participants received one or two doses (28 days apart) of the study 
vaccine.  
Flucelvax Tetra efficacy was assessed by the prevention of confirmed influenza illness caused by any 
influenza Type A or B strain.  Influenza cases were identified by active surveillance of influenza-like 
illness (ILI) and confirmed by viral culture and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  An 
ILI episode was defined as a fever body temperature ≥ 37.8°C) along with at least one of the following: 
cough,  sore  throat,  nasal  congestion,  or  rhinorrhoea.  Vaccine  efficacy  against  laboratory  confirmed 
influenza was calculated (Table 6).

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Flucelvax Tetra is and what it is used for 
Flucelvax Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Flucelvax Tetra is prepared in cell cultures, and, 
therefore, is egg-free. 
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can 
cause flu. 
Flucelvax Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults and children from 2 years of age. 
The vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World 
Health Organisation for the 2023/2024 SEASON. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax Tetra 
You should not receive Flucelvax Tetra: 
If you are allergic to: 
• 
the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
•  beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, or polysorbate 80, which are trace 
residues from the manufacturing process. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Flucelvax Tetra. 
BEFORE receiving the vaccine 
•  Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily 
available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms 
such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the 
administration. This reaction may occur with Flucelvax Tetra as with all vaccines that are injected. 
•  You should tell your doctor if you have an acute illness associated with fever. Your doctor may 
decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment 
which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or 
corticosteroid medicines (see section “Other medicines and Flucelvax Tetra”). 
•  You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
•  Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or 
nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. 
As with all vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
Children aged less than 2 years 
This vaccine is currently not recommended in children aged less than 2 years as safety and efficacy in 
this age group have not been established. 
Other medicines and Flucelvax Tetra

including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other 
vaccine. 
Flucelvax Tetra may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Pregnancy 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.

‘sodium-free’. 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How Flucelvax Tetra is given 
Flucelvax Tetra is given to you by your doctor or nurse as an injection into the muscle at the top of the 
upper arm (deltoid muscle) or into the muscle of the upper and outer part of the thigh in young 
children depending on the muscle size. 
Adults and children from 2 years of age: 
One dose of 0.5 ml

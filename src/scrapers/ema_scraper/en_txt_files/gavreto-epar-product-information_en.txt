CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Gavreto is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with rearranged during 
transfection (RET) fusion-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously 
treated with a RET inhibitor.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer medicinal 
products. 
Patient selection for treatment of RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC should be based on a 
validated test method. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 400 mg pralsetinib once daily on an empty stomach (see method of 
administration). Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
If vomiting occurs after taking a dose of pralsetinib, the patient should not take an additional dose but 
continue with the next scheduled dose. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of pralsetinib is missed, the patient should make up for the missed dose as soon as possible 
on the same day. The regular daily dose schedule for pralsetinib should be resumed the next day.

Dose modification for use with strong cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitors or combined 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of pralsetinib with known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or combined P-gp and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided (see section 4.4 and section 4.5). If co-administration with a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the 
current dose of pralsetinib should be reduced as recommended in Table 2. After the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor or combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor have been discontinued for 3 to 5 
elimination half-lives, the pralsetinib dose that was taken prior to the use of the inhibitor should be 
resumed.

Dose modification for use with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Concomitant use of pralsetinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided (see section 4.4 and 
section 4.5). If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, the dose of 
pralsetinib should be increased to double the current pralsetinib dose starting on Day 7 of 
co-administration of pralsetinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer. After the strong CYP3A4 inducer 
has been discontinued for at least 14 days, the pralsetinib dose that was taken prior to the use of the 
inducer should be resumed.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance [CLCR] 30 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). Pralsetinib has not been studied in 
patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR 15 to 29 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease 
(CLCR <15 mL/min). Since pralsetinib elimination via the kidney is negligible, no dose adjustment is 
required in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper 
limit of normal [ULN] and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST). 
Pralsetinib has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, therefore its 
use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see section 5.2). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients aged 65 years and above (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of pralsetinib in paediatric patients below 18 years of age with RET 
fusion-positive advanced NSCLC have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Gavreto is for oral use. Patients should swallow the hard capsules whole with a glass of water, on an 
empty stomach. They should not eat for at least two hours before and at least one hour after taking 
pralsetinib (see section 5.2).  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Pneumonitis/ILD 
Severe, life-threatening or fatal cases of pneumonitis/ILD have been reported in patients who received 
pralsetinib in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Patients who present with clinically symptomatic 
pneumonitis or ILD were excluded from clinical trials. 
Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider immediately to report new or worsening 
respiratory symptoms.  
Patients who present with acute or worsening of respiratory symptoms indicative of pneumonitis/ILD 
(e.g., dyspnoea, cough, and fever) should be investigated to exclude other potential causes. If 
pneumonitis/ILD is considered to be related to pralsetinib, the dose of Gavreto should be interrupted, 
reduced or permanently discontinued based on severity of confirmed pneumonitis/ILD (see 
section 4.2). 
Hypertension 
Hypertension was observed in pralsetinib-treated patients in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Treatment-
related hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertensive medicinal products. 
Treatment with Gavreto should not be initiated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Pre-
existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Gavreto treatment. Monitoring 
of blood pressure is recommended after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. 
Anti-hypertensive therapy should be initiated or adjusted as appropriate. The dose should be 
interrupted, reduced, or permanently discontinued based on the severity of hypertension observed 
during treatment with Gavreto (see section 4.2). 
Transaminase elevations 
Severe cases of transaminase elevations have been reported in patients who received pralsetinib in 
clinical trials (see section 4.8).  
ALT and AST should be monitored prior to initiating Gavreto, every 2 weeks during the first 
3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Treatment with Gavreto should be 
interrupted, reduced or permanently discontinued based on severity of the transaminase elevation 
observed during treatment with Gavreto (see section 4.2).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemorrhagic events 
Severe, including fatal, haemorrhagic events can occur with Gavreto. In patients with life-threatening 
or recurrent severe haemorrhage, Gavreto should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). 
QT prolongation 
Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed in patients who received Gavreto in clinical trials 
(see section 4.8). Therefore, before starting Gavreto treatment, patients should have a QTc interval 
≤470 ms and serum electrolytes within normal range. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and 
hypocalcaemia should be corrected both prior and during Gavreto treatment. Electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) and serum electrolytes should be monitored at the end of the first week and of the first month 
of Gavreto treatment, then periodically, as clinically indicated, depending also on presence of other 
risk factors (e.g. intercurrent diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, concomitant medications).  
Pralsetinib should be used with caution in patients with medical history of cardiac arrhythmias or QT 
interval prolongation, as well as in patients on strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors or on medicinal products 
known to be associated with QT/QTc prolongation. 
Gavreto may require interruption, dose modification, or discontinuation (see section 4.2). 
Tuberculosis 
Tuberculosis, mostly extrapulmonary, has been reported in patients receiving Gavreto. Before starting 
treatment, patients should be evaluated for active and inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis, as per local 
recommendations.  In patients with active or latent tuberculosis,  standard antimycobacterial therapy 
should be initiated before treatment with Gavreto is started. 
Drug interactions 
Co-administration of Gavreto with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be avoided because they may increase the plasma concentration of pralsetinib (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.5).  
Co-administration of Gavreto with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided because they may 
decrease the plasma concentration of pralsetinib (see section 4.2 and section 4.5). 
Fertility and pregnancy 
During treatment with Gavreto and for at least 1 week after the final dose, male patients with female 
partners of childbearing potential must use effective contraception, including a barrier method (see 
section 4.6).  
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
Gavreto. A highly effective non-hormonal method of contraception is required for female patients 
during treatment with pralsetinib, because pralsetinib can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. 
If a hormonal method of contraception is unavoidable, then a condom must be used in combination 
with the hormonal method. Effective contraception must be continued for at least 2 weeks after the 
final dose (see section 4.6).  
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
In vitro data indicate that pralsetinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and transported by P-gp. 
Therefore, inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may alter the plasma concentrations of 
pralsetinib. 
Active substances that may have an effect on pralsetinib  
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of pralsetinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or combined P-gp and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase pralsetinib plasma concentrations, which may increase the incidence 
and severity of adverse reactions of pralsetinib. Co-administration of 200 mg pralsetinib once daily 
with itraconazole 200 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) increased pralsetinib Cmax 
by 84% and AUC0-∞ by 251%, compared to pralsetinib administered alone. 
Therefore, co-administration of pralsetinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or combined P-gp and 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole nefazodone, grapefruit or Seville oranges) 
should be avoided (see section 4.4). If co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or combined 
P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the current dose of pralsetinib 
(section 4.2). 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of pralsetinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease pralsetinib plasma 
concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of pralsetinib. Co-administration of 400 mg 
pralsetinib as a single dose with rifampin 600 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased 
pralsetinib Cmax by 30% and AUC0-∞ by 68%. Based on a population PK analysis, CYP3A4 weak 
inducers decreased pralsetinib exposures, but were not clinically significant in patients with NSCLC.  
Therefore, co-administration of pralsetinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers (including, but not limited 
to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort [Hypericum 
perforatum]) should be avoided (see section 4.4). If co-administration cannot be avoided, increase the 
pralsetinib dose (see section 4.2). 
Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, 
MATE1 and MATE2-K with narrow therapeutic index 
Co-administration of pralsetinib can alter the exposure of sensitive substrates of CYP enzymes 
(CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8) and transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, 
MATE1 and MATE2-K). Substrate drugs of these CYP enzymes and transporters with narrow 
therapeutic index (including, but not limited to cyclosporine, paclitaxel and warfarin) should be 
avoided.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males 
Women of childbearing potential should be informed that pralsetinib may cause foetal harm (see 
section 5.3).  
The pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiating Gavreto 
treatment. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women of childbearing potential have to use highly effective non-hormonal contraception during 
treatment and for at least 2 weeks following the last dose of Gavreto (see section 4.4).  
Males with female partners of childbearing potential must use effective contraception, including a 
barrier method, during treatment with Gavreto and for at least 1 week following the last dose of 
Gavreto.  
Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they become pregnant, 
or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking Gavreto. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of pralsetinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, pralsetinib may cause foetal harm when 
administered to pregnant women.  
Gavreto should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with pralsetinib. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pralsetinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Gavreto and for 1 week following the 
final dose.  
Fertility 
There is no clinical data on the effects of pralsetinib on fertility.  
Based on non-clinical safety findings, fertility may be compromised during treatment with pralsetinib 
(see section 5.3). Men and women should seek advice on effective fertility preservation before 
treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Gavreto has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be exercised 
when driving or operating machines as patients may experience fatigue while taking Gavreto (see 
section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects

common adverse reactions resulting in dose reductions were neutropenia (15.6%), anaemia (10.6%), 
lymphopenia (7.2%), pneumonitis (5.7%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (5.2%), 
hypertension (4.8%), leukopenia (4.6%), and fatigue (4.1%). 
Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 10.6% of patients treated with 
Gavreto. The most common adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of Gavreto were 
pneumonia and pneumonitis (2.6% and 2.2%, respectively).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety population includes a total of 540 patients, including 281 patients with advanced NCSLC, 
as well as patients with other solid tumours (including RET fusion thyroid cancer and RET mutation 
medullary thyroid cancer), who received pralsetinib at a starting dose of 400 mg, see section 5.1. No 
clinically relevant differences in the safety profile across indications have been observed.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Pneumonitis/ILD 
Pneumonitis and ILD occurred in 12.2% of 540 patients with NSCLC or other solid tumours, enrolled 
in the ARROW Study who received Gavreto (see section 4.4). Among the patients who had 
pneumonitis/ILD, the median time to onset was 16.1 weeks. 
Serious adverse reactions of pneumonitis/ILD were reported for 5.7% of patients, including Grade 3 
events (2.8%), Grade 4 (0.6%) and one fatal (Grade 5) event (0.2%).  
In clinical trials, the majority of the patients with Grade 1 or Grade 2 pneumonitis were able to 
continue treatment without recurrent pneumonitis/ILD following dose interruption and dose reduction. 
Dose interruption occurred in 8.9%, dose reduction in 5.7% and permanent dose discontinuation in 
2.2% of patients due to ILD/pneumonitis. The median time to resolution was 4.3 weeks.  
Hypertension 
Hypertension (including blood pressure increased) occurred in 35.0% of 540 patients with NSCLC or 
other solid tumours, including Grade ≤2 events in 17.4% and Grade 3 in 17.6% of patients. No 
Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were reported. Among the patients who had hypertension, the median time 
to onset was 2.1 weeks. 
Serious adverse reactions of hypertension were reported in 1.3% of all patients (all Grade 3 events). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose interruption occurred in 8.0% of patients, dose reduction in 4.8% and one patient (0.2%) 
required permanent dose discontinuation. The median time to resolution was 4.0 weeks.  
Transaminase elevations 
Increased AST occurred in 49.1% of 540 patients, including Grade 3 or 4 in 6.9% of patients. 
Increased ALT occurred in 37.0% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 events in 4.8% of patients. The 
median time to first onset for increased AST was 2.1 weeks and increased ALT was 3.5 weeks. 
Serious adverse reactions of increased AST and ALT were reported in 0.7% and 0.6% of patients, 
respectively. 
Dose interruption due to increased AST or ALT occurred in 5.0% and 3.9% of patients, respectively 
and dose reduction in 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively. No patients required permanent dose 
discontinuation. The median time to resolution was 6.0 and 5.1 weeks for increased AST and ALT, 
respectively.  
Haemorrhagic events  
Haemorrhagic events occurred in 20.6% of the 540 patients, including Grade 3 events in 3.7% of 
patients and a Grade 4 or fatal (Grade 5) event each occurred in one patient (0.2%).  
Serious adverse reactions of haemorrhage were reported for 3.9% of patients.  
Seventeen patients (3.1%) required dose interruption. Dose reduction or permanent dose 
discontinuation due to haemorrhage occurred in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively.  
QT prolongation 
QT prolongation occurred in 5.2% of 540 patients with NSCLC or other solid tumours. In 2 patients 
(0.4%) the event was assessed as serious. The majority of patients experienced non-severe events – i.e. 
Grade 1, in 21 (3.9%) and Grade 2, in 5 patients (0.9%). Two patients (0.4%) experienced Grade 3 
events of Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, which both resolved. There was no life-threatening or 
fatal QT prolongation. Three patients (0.6%) had an event that remained unresolved by time of data 
cut-off. Dose reductions or interruptions were required by two Electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
patients, each. No QT prolongation event led to permanent discontinuation of pralsetinib. 
Infections 
Infections were commonly experienced by 66.1% of 540 patients during the median treatment time of 
15.9 months. Most frequently (>10%), pneumonia and urinary tract infection were reported (22.4% 
and 14.8%, respectively). The majority of infections were mild (Grade 1 or 2) and resolved; severe 
infection (Grade ≥3) occurred in 30.4% patients (with fatal events reported for 4.1%).  
Infections reported as serious occurred for 18.5% of patients. The most common (>2%) serious 
infection was pneumonia (15.6%), followed by urinary tract infection (3.7%) and sepsis (3.7%). The 
majority of patients experiencing sepsis had concurrent pneumonia or urinary tract infection reported. 
Dose interruption due to infection occurred in 12.8% of patients (mainly due to pneumonia [10.9%] 
and urinary tract infection [2.6%]). Dose was reduced due to infections in 3.7% of patients (mainly 
due to pneumonia [3.5%]). Permanent treatment discontinuation was required by 2.6% of patients due 
to infections (mainly due to pneumonia [2.6%]). 
Elderly 
In ARROW (N=540), 30.9% of patients were 65 years of age and older. Compared with younger 
patients (<65), more patients of ≥65 years old reported adverse reactions that led to permanent dose 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation (29.3% versus 18.8%). Of the commonly reported events with higher incidence in 
elderly patients (≥65), hypertension has the greatest difference in comparison with patients <65 years 
of age. However, hypertension is also expected to occur more frequently in the elderly population. 
Older patients reported more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions compared to younger patients 
(89.8% versus 78.3%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
No cases of overdose have been reported in clinical trials with pralsetinib. The maximum dose of 
pralsetinib studied clinically is 600 mg orally once daily. Adverse reactions observed at this dose were 
consistent with the safety profile at 400 mg once daily (see section 4.8).  
Management 
There is no known antidote for Gavreto overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, Gavreto should 
be interrupted and supportive care instituted. Based on the large volume of distribution of pralsetinib 
and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of pralsetinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX23. 
Mechanism of action 
Pralsetinib is a potent protein kinase inhibitor that selectively targets oncogenic RET fusions (KIF5B-
RET and CCDC6-RET). In NSCLC, RET fusions are one of the main oncogenic drivers. In vitro, 
pralsetinib inhibited several oncogenic RET fusions more potently than off-target kinases at clinically 
relevant concentrations (e.g. 81-fold selectivity over VEGFR2). Pralsetinib exhibited anti-tumour 
activity in cultured cells and animal tumour implantation models representing multiple tumour types 
harbouring oncogenic RET fusions (KIF5B-RET, CCDC6-RET).  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The QT interval prolongation potential of pralsetinib was assessed in 34 patients with RET fusion-
positive solid tumours administered at 400 mg once daily in a formal ECG sub-study.  
In patients receiving pralsetinib in the ARROW study, QT prolongation was reported (see section 4.8). 
Therefore, dose interruption or modification may be required in patients treated with pralsetinib (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Gavreto was studied in patients with RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC in Study 
BLU-667-1101 (ARROW), a multicenter, non-randomised, open-label, multi-cohort phase I/II clinical 
trial. The study enrolled, in separate cohorts, patients with RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC who 
had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy as well as patients that progressed on prior therapy 
other than platinum based therapy or were systemic treatment-naïve. The study was ongoing at the 
time of approval.  
All NSCLC patients were required to have locally advanced or metastatic disease with measurable 
disease by Response Evaluable Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. (v1.1) and have a 
RET fusion as determined by local testing (Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), other). Patients with asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, 
including patients with stable or decreasing steroid use within 2 weeks prior to study entry, were 
enrolled. The protocol excluded patients with a known primary driver alteration other than RET 
fusions, patients with a history of prolonged QT syndrome or Torsades de pointes or a familial history 
of prolonged QT syndrome, clinically symptomatic pneumonitis, and any prior or ongoing clinically 
significant medical condition that could affect patient's safety. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 as 
evaluated by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Secondary efficacy outcomes included 
duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Overall RET fusion-positive NSCLC population  
The efficacy population consisted of 281 patients with RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC who 
were treated at a starting dose of 400 mg orally once daily, including 116 who were treatment-naïve 
and 141 who previously received platinum-based chemotherapy. As of the last data cut-off date (4 
March 2022), the median follow-up was 24.1 months.  
The demographic characteristics across the 281 patients were: 54.1% female, 46.3% White, 
45.6% Asian, 3.6% Hispanic/Latino, and the median age was 60.0 years (range: 26 to 87) with 
37.4% ≥65 years of age. The majority of patients had an ECOG performance status at baseline of 
0 (29.5%) or 1 (68.0%), had metastatic disease (98.6%), had never smoked (62.6%) or were former 
smokers (33.1%) and had adenocarcinoma (96.8%). A history of brain metastases was seen in 34.5% 
of patients. Patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (N=141), received a median 
of 2 prior lines of therapy (range: 1-8). In addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, 40.4% received 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, 27.7% received multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) and 48.9% received prior 
radiation therapy. 15.5% of systemic treatment-naïve patients (N=116) received prior radiation 
therapy.  RET fusions were detected in 75.8% of patients using NGS (36.7% tissue samples; 15.7% 
plasma samples, 23.5% unknown), 15.3% using FISH, 6.0% unknown, and 2.8% using other methods. 
The most common RET fusion partners were KIF5B (70.1%) and CCD6 (17.8%). 
Efficacy results are summarised in Table 4. The median time to first response was 1.8 months for the 
overall population (range: 0.9-20.5 months), as well as for patients previously treated with platinum 
chemotherapy (range: 1.3-11.4 months) and treatment-naïve patients (range: 0.9-20.5 months).

No clinically relevant difference in efficacy was seen in patients with a KIF5B or CCDC6 fusion 
partner. BICR response rates were: ORR= 68.5% (95% CI: 61.5, 74.9) in 197 patients with a KIF5B 
fusion partner; and ORR= 72.0% (95% CI: 57.5, 83.8) in 50 patients with a CCDC6 fusion partner. 
In the efficacy population, the CNS ORR by central assessment (per RECIST v1.1) was 53.3% (95% 
CI: 26.6, 78.7); 3 patients (20.0%) had a CR and 5 patients (33.3%) had a PR. 
Elderly population 
In ARROW (N=540), 30.9% of patients were 65 years of age and older. No overall differences in 
pharmacokinetic, safety or efficacy were observed in comparison with younger patients. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Gavreto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of lung cancer (small cell and 
non-small cell lung cancer) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Conditional approval

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pralsetinib Cmax and AUC in patients increased inconsistently over the dose range of 60 mg to 600 mg 
once daily (0.15 to 1.5 times the recommended dose); pharmacokinetics was linear in the dose range 
of 200 and 400 mg in healthy volunteers. Pralsetinib plasma concentrations reached steady state by 3 
to 5 days. 
At the recommended dose of 400 mg once daily under fasting conditions, the mean steady state Cmax 
of pralsetinib was 2840 ng/mL and the mean steady state area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC0-24h) was 40100 h•ng/mL. The mean accumulation ratio was ~2-fold after repeated dosing. 
Absorption 
The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 hours following single doses of 
pralsetinib 60 mg to 600 mg (0.15 to 1.5 times the approved recommended dose). The absolute 
bioavailability of pralsetinib has not been determined. 
Effect of food 
Following administration of a single dose of 200 mg Gavreto with a high-fat meal (approximately 800 
to 1000 calories with 50 to 60% of calories from fat), the mean (90% CI) Cmax of pralsetinib was 
increased by 104% (65%, 153%), the mean (90% CI) AUC0-∞ was increased by 122% (96%, 152%), 
and the median Tmax was delayed from 4 to 8.5 hours, compared to the fasted state.  
Distribution 
The steady state mean apparent volume of distribution of pralsetinib is 255 L. Plasma protein binding 
of pralsetinib is 97.1% and is independent of concentration. The blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.6 to 0.7. 
Biotransformation 
Pralsetinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and 
CYP1A2 in vitro.  
Following a single oral dose of approximately 310 mg of radiolabelled pralsetinib to healthy subjects, 
pralsetinib metabolites from oxidation (M531, M453, M549b) and glucuronidation (M709) were 
detected in small to trace amounts (~ 5%). 
Elimination 
The mean plasma elimination half-life of pralsetinib was 13.4 hours following a single dose of 400 mg 
(the recommended dose) pralsetinib and 17.9 hours following multiple doses of 400 mg pralsetinib. 
The steady state mean apparent oral clearance of pralsetinib (CL/F) is 9.9 L/h. 
Following a single oral dose of radiolabelled pralsetinib to healthy subjects, 72.5% of the radioactive 
dose was recovered in faeces (66% as unchanged) and 6.1% in urine (4.8% as unchanged). 
Interactions with CYP substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that pralsetinib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. Pralsetinib may have the potential to inhibit or induce CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interactions with transport proteins 
In vitro studies indicate that pralsetinib may have the potential to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, MATE1, and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Pralsetinib is a 
substrate of P-gp. (see section 4.5). 
In vitro studies with drug transporters 
In vitro studies indicate that pralsetinib may be a potential substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Special populations 
No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pralsetinib were observed based on age 
(19 to 87 years), sex, race (White, Black, or Asian), body weight (34.9 to 128 kg), mild to moderate 
(CLCR 30 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) renal impairment, or mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST). The 
effect of severe renal impairment (CLCR 15 to 29 mL/min), end-stage renal disease 
(CLCR < 15 mL/min), or moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 times ULN and 
any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of pralsetinib is unknown (see section 4.2). Hence, no dose 
modifications are needed in the above mentioned special populations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies 
In studies of up to 13 weeks duration in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, the primary findings at 
exposures similar to steady state human exposures (AUC) at 400 mg once daily in patients with 
advanced NSCLC included physeal dysplasia in the rat (2 times margin) and haematological effects (1 
times margin) in both species. Additional adverse findings at higher exposures include degenerative 
changes in male and female reproductive organs (2 times margin) and increases in blood phosphorus 
with corresponding mineralization in soft tissues in rats (≥2 times margin), and myocardial 
haemorrhage in rats (4.4 times margin). Increased blood pressure was observed in rats after a single 
dose of 25 mg/kg (2 times). The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) of pralsetinib in the 
13-week studies was 10 mg/kg/day in both species, corresponding to exposure (AUC) margins of 
1 times relative to the human exposures. 
Regarding local exposure and toxicity, there was no evidence of gastrointestinal disturbance in either 
species up to the NOAEL dose of 10 mg/kg (0.9 times human margin). At higher doses in monkeys, 
gastrointestinal ulcerations and haemorrhage were observed. 
Embryotoxicity / Teratogenicity 
In an embryo-fetal development study, administration of pralsetinib to rats during the period of 
organogenesis was teratogenic and embryotoxic at exposures below the steady-state human clinical 
exposure (AUC) at 400 mg once daily dose. Malformations, including visceral (primarily kidney and 
ureter) and skeletal (vertebral, rib, costal cartilage, and vertebral central anomalies) were observed at 
approximately 0.2-fold of the human exposure. Postimplantation loss occurred at 0.5-fold of the 
human exposure, and increased to 100% incidence at 1.5-fold of human exposure. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In a dedicated fertility and early embryonic development study conducted in treated male rats mated to 
treated female rats pralsetinib did not have an effect on male or female mating performance or ability 
to become pregnant. However, consistent with the findings of the embryofetal development toxicology 
study there was post-implantation loss at doses as low as 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the human 
exposure (AUC) at the clinical dose of 400 mg based on toxicokinetic data from the 13-week rat 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
toxicology study). At the 20 mg/kg dose level (approximately 2.5-3.6 times the human exposure) 82% 
of female rats had totally resorbed litters, with 92% post-implantation loss (early resorptions). In a 
separate fertility and early embryonic development study in which male rats administered pralsetinib 
were mated with untreated female rats, intrauterine survival of the embryos (mean litter proportions of 
post-implantation loss and mean numbers and litter proportions of viable embryos) were unaffected by 
pralsetinib administration to males at the 20 mg/kg dose level (approximately 1.4 times the human 
exposure (AUC) at the clinical dose of 400 mg based on toxicokinetic data collected in this study). In 
addition, no pralsetinib-related effects on male reproductive performance (mating, fertility, and 
pregnancy indices) were observed in this study. 
In a 13-week repeat-dose toxicology study, male rats exhibited microscopic evidence of tubular 
degeneration/atrophy in the testis with secondary cellular debris and reduced sperm in the lumen of the 
epididymis, which correlated with lower mean testis and epididymis weights and gross observations of 
soft and small testis. Female rats exhibited degeneration of the corpus luteum in the ovary. For both 
sexes, these effects were observed at pralsetinib doses ≥10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.9 times the 
human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 400 mg. 
No findings were noted in the reproductive organs in a 13-week repeated-dose toxicology study in 
monkeys at dose levels up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 times the human exposure at the 400 mg 
once daily dose). 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Pralsetinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was negative 
in both in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and in vivo rat bone marrow 
micronucleus tests. 
Carcinogenicity studies with pralsetinib have not been conducted.

  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Gavreto is and what it is used for 
What Gavreto is 
Gavreto is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance pralsetinib. 
What Gavreto is used for 
Gavreto is used to treat adults with advanced stages of a form of lung cancer called ‘non-small cell 
lung cancer’ (‘NSCLC’), that presents with a specific rearrangement in a gene called rearranged 
during transfection (RET) if you have not been previously treated with another RET inhibitor 
medicine.  
How Gavreto works 
In patients whose cancer is due to an altered RET gene, the change in the gene causes the body to 
make an abnormal protein called a RET fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and 
cancer. Gavreto blocks the action of RET fusion proteins and may help to slow or stop your lung 
cancer from growing. It may also help to shrink your cancer. 
If you have any questions about how Gavreto works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
please ask your doctor.

barrier method, during treatment and for 1 week after completion of treatment.

into your breast milk. You should not breast-feed during treatment with this medicine and for at least 1 
week after the last dose. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby during this time.  
Fertility: 
It is possible that this medicine could permanently affect your ability to have children. You are 
encouraged to talk to a doctor about saving your sperm or eggs before using Gavreto.

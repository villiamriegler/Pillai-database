Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nintedanib (respiratory indication), 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A search of MAH's databases using the PTs belonging to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Reporting 
(MedDRA) HLT ‘Colitis (excluding infective)’ identified high number of cases reported in clinical trials and 
in post-marketing setting. Based on the substantial number of cases reporting colitis, the described cases 
of positive rechallenge and dechallenge, and the potential mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur 
concluded that ‘colitis’ should be added as new adverse drug reaction with a frequency ‘uncommon’ 
respectively in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nintedanib (respiratory indication) the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nintedanib (respiratory indication) is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

A Safety Topic Review was undertaken to evaluate reports

of anaphylactic reactions in patients treated with 
Group of variations including one type II to update 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 
of the PL with anaphylactic reactions reported with a 
rare frequency following a safety review and a Type 
IB variation to update section 6.6 of the SmPC in 
order to include recommendations to minimise the 
risk of unintended occupational exposures in 
healthcare professionals. Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
and Annex IID have been updated regarding the 
educational materials, prescribing and dispensing 
restrictions in order to provide more clarity about the 
recommended maximum duration of treatment. 
Finally the MAH took the opportunity to make 
editorial changes throughout the product 
information.

lenalidomide. This was as a result of anaphylactic reactions 
with pomalidomide, a compound of the same class 
(immunomodulatory drugs) being identified as a potential 
safety signal during routine signal detection activities. The 
SmPC has been updated to include information on 
anaphylactic reactions in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 (with a 
rare frequency).  
Lenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, 
anaphylactic reaction, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, 
TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed 
following discontinuation for these reactions. Interruption 
or discontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for 
other forms of skin reaction depending on severity. 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of 
these reactions by their prescribers and should be told to 
seek medical attention immediately if they develop these 
symptoms. Patients with a history of severe rash associated 
with thalidomide treatment should not receive 
lenalidomide. 
Section 6.6 of the SmPC is updated in order to include a 
Page 6/44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation to wear disposable gloves to minimise the 
risk of unintended occupational exposures in healthcare 
professionals and caregivers. Women who are pregnant or 
suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister 
or capsule. 
The MAH has also proposed minor updates to section 4.4 of 
the SmPC and Annex IID regarding the educational 
materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions in order 
to provide more clarity about the recommended maximum 
duration of treatment and handling of the product. 
The SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 6.6 and Annex IID 
have been updated. The PL section 4 on allergic reaction 
side effects has been updated accordingly.

receiving lenalidomide were amended to propose, in 
countries where the 7.5 mg hard capsules are available, 
7.5 mg daily dosing as an alternative to the current 15 mg 
dosing every other day, based on the results of simulation 
of concentration-time profile, which  suggest that the 
steady-state daily AUC (2506 ng•h/mL) at 7.5 mg once 
daily in patients with severe renal impairment is similar to 
that at 25 mg once daily in patients with CLcr ≥ 50 mL/min

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Revlimid remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
- 
Given the seriousness of the adverse events 
reported since the initial granting of the marketing 
authorisation of Revlimid and particularly with respect to 
the recent reports of  second primary malignancies and 
severe lenalidomide-induced hepatoxicity, a careful 
monitoring of any newly emerging safety signals is 
recommended. 
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Revlimid, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

of lenalidomide following a single oral dose in healthy male 
subjects and also reviewed all pharmacokinetic data 
available on lenalidomide.  
Consequently, the product information was updated with 
regard to information on absorption as follows: 
Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral 
administration in healthy volunteers, under fasting 
conditions, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring 
between 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose. In patients, as well as 
in healthy volunteers, the maximum concentration (Cmax) 
and area-under-the-concentration time curve (AUC) 
increase proportionally with increases in dose. Multiple 
dosing does not cause marked drug accumulation. In 
plasma, the relative exposures of the S- and R- 
enantiomers of lenalidomide are approximately 56% and 
44%, respectively. 
Co-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in 
healthy volunteers reduces the extent of absorption, 
resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in area under 
the concentration versus time curve (AUC) and 50% 
decrease in Cmax in plasma. However, in the pivotal 
multiple myeloma registration trials where the efficacy and 
safety were established for lenalidomide, the drug was 
administered without regard to food intake. Thus, 
lenalidomide can be administered with or without food. 
Information on the metabolism and excretion of 
lenalidomide was also updated to indicate the following: 
A majority of lenalidomide is eliminated through urinary 
excretion. The contribution of renal excretion to total

with 4% of lenalidomide eliminated in faeces. 
Lenalidomide is poorly metabolized as 82% of the dose is 
excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-lenalidomide and N-
acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% of the

(predominantly deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular 
accident).  
A review of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEEs) in 
Celgene Pharmacovigilance database through 26 December 
2009, presented a total of 493 medically confirmed reports 
of ATEE. The overall reporting rate for ATEEs was 0.5%. 
The review showed predominance of cardiac events 
(65.7%, mainly myocardial infarctions with 319 reports). A 
causal relationship between lenalidomide and ATEEs cannot 
be excluded. However, possible explanations and 
predisposing factors remain to be determined, and the 
mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of myocardial 
infarctions remain unknown.  
The use of thromboprophylaxis was not documented in the 
majority of patients with ATEEs (>60%) and venous TEEs 
(>80%) while risk factors were identified in most of the 
patients with medically confirmed thromboembolic event. 
Prophylactic antithrombotic medicines should be 
recommended, especially in patients with additional 
thrombotic risk factors. If the patient experiences any 
thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued

and standard anticoagulation therapy started. Once the 
patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation 
treatment and any complications of the thromboembolic 
event have been managed, the lenalidomide treatment may 
be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit 
risk assessment. The patient should continue 
anticoagulation therapy during the course of lenalidomide 
treatment.

Dexamethasone versus CC 5013 plus Low Dose 
Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma with Thalidomide plus 
Dexamethasone Salvage Therapy for Non-Responders" 
(FU2 022.2).  
This open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 study 
was conducted in 445 patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma; 222 patients were randomized to the 
lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm, and 223 were 
randomized to the lenalidomide/standard dose

dexamethasone arm. Patients randomized to the 
lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm received 
lenalidomide 25 mg/day, Days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus 
dexamethasone 40 mg/day on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 
to 20 every 28 days for the first four cycles. Patients 
randomized to the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone 
arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day, Days 1 to 21 every 
28 days plus low dose dexamethasone 40 mg/day on Days 
1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days. In the lenalidomide/low 
dose dexamethasone group, 20 patients (9.1%) underwent 
at least one dose interruption compared to 65 patients 
(29.3%) in the lenalidomide /standard dose 
dexamethasone arm. 
In a post-hoc analysis, lower mortality was observed in the 
lenalidomide /low dose dexamethasone arm 6.8% (15/220) 
compared to lenalidomide standard dose dexamethasone 
arm 19.3% (43/223), in the newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma patient population, with a median follow up of 
72.3 weeks.  
However with a longer follow-up, the difference in overall 
survival in favour of low dose dexamethasone tends to 
decrease. 
Considering that the patient population differs from the 
authorised indication, these results should be interpreted 
with caution. 
The product information has been updated further to the

of 314 medically confirmed reports of myocardial infarction/ 
myocardial ischaemia with 318 adverse events were 
retrieved during the period covered from the first trial in 
man to 26 December 2008. 
As of 26 December, 2008, a total of 75 cases of myocardial 
infarction have been notified out of the 9308 patients 
exposed to lenalidomide throughout the clinical studies, 
i.e., a global incidence of 0.8%. However, a 1.98% 
incidence rate of myocardial infarction was observed in 
multiple myeloma patients. This frequency indicates that 
myocardial infarction is a common adverse reaction in 
multiple myeloma patients treated with Revlimid 
(lenalidomide). 
Consequently, the product information was updated to add 
a warning in section 4.4 of the SPC that "Myocardial 
infarction has been reported in patients receiving 
lenalidomide, particularly in those with known risk factors. 
Consequently, patients with known risk factors should be 
closely monitored, and action should be taken to try to 
minimize all modifiable risk factors (eg. smoking, 
hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia)." 
Myocardial infarction was added as a common adverse 
reaction in Section 4.8 of the SPC and in the Package 
Leaflet.

5013 MM-010 with cut-off dates of 23 July 2008 and 2 
March 2008, respectively.  
Further to the assessment of this follow-up measure, the 
CHMP concluded that based on updated follow up data, TTP 
is still significantly higher in lenalidomide/dexamethasone 
treated patients than placebo/dexamethasone treated 
patients (HR=0.35; p<0.001). For OS, the benefit is less 
important but remains significant (HR=0.833; logrank 
p<0.045). 
The benefit-risk ratio of Revlimid remains positive.

monitored closely, as a possible cross-reaction between 
lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the 
literature.  
 Severe skin reactions 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN) have been reported. Lenalidomide must be 
discontinued for exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS or TEN 
is suspected, and should not be resumed following 
discontinuation for these reactions. Interruption or 
discontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for 
other forms of skin reaction depending on severity.  
Patients with a history of severe rash associated with 
thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide. 
Hypersensitvity reaction has been added as a rare adverse 
reaction in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
In section 4.4 of the SPC, the warning concerning the use

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
the 2nd PSUR, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
conducted a safety review to evaluate the reports of 
several adverse events reported. 
Stevens Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome among patients receiving 
lenalidomide, retrieved a total of 13 SJS case reports (2 
reports from clinical trials, 11 post-marketing reports 
received from healthcare professionals). In addition, a 
single report of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis was reported.  
Overall, taking into account the potential causal 
relationship between Stevens-Johnson Syndrome 
occurrence and Lenalidomide (compatible time to onset, 
biopsy confirming diagnosis of SJS in one case, and 
evolution), the low but non negligible reporting rate 
(0.03%), and the seriousness of the pathology, the CHMP 
considered the MAH's proposal to add Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis in section 4.8 of 
the SPC and in the Package Leaflet as a rare adverse event. 
Angioedema 
After reviewing data from clinical trials, post-marketing and 
literature, a total of 161 cases have been retrieved and 
analysed by the MAH. There were two reports of 
angioedema with positive re-challenges. Despite an unclear 
temporal relationship of lenalidomide to angioedema, 
clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing 
lenalidomide for patients who have had a history of 
hypersensitivity adverse reactions, specifically to 
thalidomide. Clearly, once angioedema has been identified, 
the risks and benefits of lenalidomide therapy should be 
considered. Therefore, angioedema was added in section 
4.8 of the SPC and in the Package Leaflet as an uncommon

adverse event.  
 Haemorragic disorders 
Based on the review of all adverse events of haemorrhage 
reported during clinical trials and post-marketing 
experience and from the literature, the CHMP considered 
that there is an increased risk of haemorrhage among 
lenalidomide patients on anticoagulants, and t

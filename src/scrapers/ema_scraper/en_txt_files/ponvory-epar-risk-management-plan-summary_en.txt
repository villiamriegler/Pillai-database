Summary of Risk Management Plan for Ponvory (ponesimod)  
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Ponvory. The RMP details important 
risks of Ponvory, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Ponvory’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ponvory’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how Ponvory should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Ponvory  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Ponvory's 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Ponvory is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis 
(RMS)  with  active  disease  defined  by  clinical  or  imaging  features  (see  SmPC  for  the  full 
indication). It contains ponesimod as the active substance and it is given by oral administration as 
20-mg  film-coated  tablets  after  treatment  initiation  with  a  14-day  up-titration  regimen,  which 
includes 2-mg, 3-mg, 4-mg, 5-mg, 6-mg, 7-mg, 8-mg, 9-mg, and 10-mg film-coated tablets.  
Further information about the evaluation of Ponvory’s benefits can be found in Ponvory’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ponvory. 
II. 
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or 
Further Characterize the Risks 
Important  risks  of  Ponvory,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Ponvory's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (eg,  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  the  case  of  Ponvory,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ponvory is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  Ponvory  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Ponvory. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk: Bradyarrhythmia occurring post-first dose 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In guinea pigs, single doses of ponesimod ≥0.3 mg/kg/day induced 
atrioventricular (AV) blocks and decreased heart rate (HR). These 
cardiovascular effects were significantly reduced on repeat dosing 
and after a low starting dose and up-titration (desensitization). 
Transient HR reductions and, less frequently, transient first- or 
second-degree AV block have been observed in the first days of 
treatment with ponesimod during the clinical development 
program. Bradycardia was identified as an adverse reaction. These 
findings and this adverse reaction are described in the SmPC. 
Risk factors include cardiac rhythm disorders or electrocardiogram 
(ECG) abnormalities indicative of an increased risk for arrhythmia, 
low resting HR, history of fainting or collapse, significant QT 
prolongation (ie, QT corrected [QTc] >500 ms), and concurrent 
therapy with anti-arrhythmic medicinal products, QT prolonging 
medicinal products, or medicinal products that slow HR. 
Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities (such as 
ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure and history of cardiac arrest 
or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled 
hypertension, and presence of AV block) are also at increased risk.

Important Identified Risk: Macular edema 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Cases of macular edema associated with changes in visual acuity 
have been reported in subjects treated with ponesimod during the 
clinical development program and macular edema was identified 
as an adverse reaction. This adverse reaction is described in the 
SmPC. 
Patients with a history of uveitis and patients with diabetes 
mellitus are at increased risk of developing macular edema during 
therapy with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators.

treatment initiation and again at any time if a patient reports 
any change in vision while on ponesimod therapy, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Ponesimod therapy should not be initiated in patients with 
macular edema until resolution, and patients with visual 
symptoms of macular edema should be evaluated and, if 
confirmed, treatment should be discontinued, as described in

Important Identified Risk: Bronchoconstriction 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In rats, a dose- and time-dependent effect on respiratory function 
was seen. The functional effect was characterized by a decrease in 
the relaxation time with a slight increase in the peak expiratory 
flow and tidal volume (increase in Penh), which indicates a 
transition from passive to more active expiration. 
Adverse events suggestive of bronchoconstriction and changes in 
pulmonary function in the form of a decrease in forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV1) have been reported in subjects treated 
with ponesimod during the clinical development program. 
Dyspnea and cough were identified as adverse reactions. These 
findings and adverse reactions are described in the SmPC. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No specific risk factors for bronchoconstriction have been 
identified.

Important Potential Risk: Severe liver injury 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
As seen with other S1P receptor modulators, liver enzyme 
elevations, such as increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), have been reported in subjects 
treated with ponesimod during the clinical development program 
and were identified as adverse reactions. These adverse reactions 
are described in the SmPC. 
Overall, the majority of ALT and AST elevations occurred within 
6 or 12 months after ponesimod treatment initiation. There were no 
Hy’s law cases in the ponesimod clinical program. Most cases of 
ALT increases ≥3x upper limit of normal were single transient 
asymptomatic episodes and resolved on continued ponesimod 
treatment; the rest resolved upon study treatment discontinuation.

Important Potential Risk: Serious opportunistic infections including PML 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Cases of infections have been reported in subjects treated with 
ponesimod during the clinical development program. Several types 
of infection were identified as adverse reactions. These findings 
and adverse reactions are described in the SmPC. 
No cases of fatal infections have been reported in subjects treated 
with ponesimod during the clinical development program; 
however, life-threatening and rare fatal infections have been 
reported in association with other S1P receptor modulators. 
Patients in an immunodeficient state and those with severe active 
infections or active chronic infections are at increased risk for 
developing serious opportunistic infections including progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

•  Results from a recent (ie, within 6 months or after 
discontinuation of prior therapy) complete blood count (CBC) 
with differential (including lymphocyte count) should be 
reviewed before treatment initiation with ponesimod, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. 
•  Assessments of CBC are recommended periodically during 
treatment with ponesimod; confirmed absolute lymphocyte 
counts <0.2x109/L should lead to interruption of ponesimod 
therapy; re-initiation of ponesimod can be considered when 
the level reaches >0.8x109/L, as described in SmPC 
Section 4.4. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment initiation with ponesimod should be delayed in 
patients with severe active infection until resolution. 
Vigilance for signs and symptoms of infection should be 
continued for 1 to 2 weeks after treatment discontinuation, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4. Before starting treatment, 
patients are advised to tell their doctor if they have a fever or 
infection, as described in PL Section 2. 
Effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be used 
in patients with symptoms of infection while on ponesimod 
therapy. Suspension of ponesimod treatment should be 
considered if a patient develops a serious infection, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4. 
Patients without an HCP-confirmed history of varicella 
(chickenpox) or without documentation of a full course of 
vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to 
VZV before treatment initiation with ponesimod, as described 
in SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. Before starting 
treatment, patients are advised to tell their doctor if they never 
had chickenpox (varicella) or have not received a vaccine for 
chickenpox, as described in PL Section 2. 
Physicians should be vigilant for clinical signs or symptoms 
of cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Patients with signs or 
symptoms consistent with a cryptococcal infection should 
undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment. 
Ponesimod treatment should be suspended until a 
cryptococcal infection has been excluded; if CM is diagnosed, 
appropriate treatment should be initiated, as described in 
SmPC Section 4.4. 
Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or 
magnetic resonance imaging findings suggestive of PML. If 
PML is suspected, ponesimod treatment should be suspended 
until PML is excluded. Treatment with ponesimod should be 
discontinued if PML is confirmed, as described in SmPC 
Section 4.4.  
 
• 
The half-life and mode of action of medicinal products with 
prolonged immune effects should be considered when 
switching from these medicinal products to avoid unintended 
additive effects on the immune system while at the same time 
minimizing risk of disease reactivation when initiating 
ponesimod, as described in SmPC Section 4.4. For the same 
reason, caution should be applied during concomitant 
administration and in the weeks following administration or, 
if there is a history of prior use before initiating, during and 
up to 1 week after the last dose of ponesimod, as described in 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
•  A full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine is 
recommended for antibody-negative patients before treatment 
initiation with ponesimod, and treatment should be delayed 
for 4 weeks after vaccination, as described in SmPC 
Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. 
• 
The use of live, attenuated vaccines should be avoided while 
on ponesimod therapy and up to 1 week after treatment 
discontinuation. If immunization with a live attenuated 
vaccine is required, ponesimod treatment should be paused 
from 1 week prior to 4 weeks after a planned vaccination, as 
described in SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5 and PL Section 2. 
Before starting treatment, patients are advised to tell their 
doctor if they have recently received any vaccinations or are 
planning to receive a vaccination, as described in PL 
Section 2. 
• 
Patients who experience symptoms of infection during 
treatment or 1 week after the last dose should call their 
physician immediately, as described in PL Sections 2 and 4. 
•  Before starting treatment, patients are advised to tell their 
doctor if they have an immune system that does not work 
properly due to a disease or are taking medicines that weaken 
their immune system, as described in PL Section 2.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Cases of skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and a case of 
malignant melanoma, have been reported in subjects treated with 
ponesimod during the clinical development program and are 
described in the SmPC. 
An increased risk of cutaneous malignancies has been reported in 
association with another S1P receptor modulator. 
Patients in an immunodeficient state and patients with a history of 
malignancies have an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

Important Potential Risk: Reproductive and embryofetal toxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Reproductive and developmental studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits have demonstrated ponesimod-induced developmental 
toxicity, including an increase in malformations (skeletal and 
visceral) and embryolethality. The area under the concentration-
time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) in rats and rabbits at 
the no-observed-adverse-effect level (1 mg/kg/day in both species) 
are lower than the human systemic exposures at the recommended 
human dose of 20 mg/day. 
Ponesimod has not been studied in pregnant women. Clinical trials 
of ponesimod excluded pregnant and breast-feeding women. Clear 
recommendations how to avoid pregnancies in women of 
childbearing potential are described in the SmPC. 
Based on human experience in patients receiving another S1P 
receptor modulator, postmarketing data suggest that its use is 
associated with an increased risk of major congenital 
malformations. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Women of childbearing potential who do not use effective 
contraception are at risk.

•  Women of childbearing potential should be counseled before 
treatment initiation on the potential for a serious risk to the 
fetus and the need for effective contraception during treatment 
with ponesimod and for 1 week after treatment 
discontinuation, as described in SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.6

• 
Patients are advised not to use ponesimod during pregnancy, 
if they are trying to become pregnant, or if they could become 
pregnant and are not using effective contraception, as 
described in PL Section 2. 
Ponesimod treatment should be discontinued immediately if a 
woman becomes pregnant during treatment, as described in 
SmPC Section 4.6 and PL Section 2.  
If a woman becomes pregnant during treatment with 
ponesimod, medical advice should be given regarding the risk 
of harmful effects to the fetus associated with treatment. 
Follow-up examinations should be performed, as described in 
SmPC Section 4.6. Patients are advised to tell their doctor if 
they become pregnant within 1 week after stopping treatment, 
as described in PL Section 2. 
Patients are advised to talk to their doctor about reliable 
methods of contraception, as described in PL Section 2.

Cases of convulsions have been reported in subjects treated with 
ponesimod during the clinical development program and are 
described in the SmPC. It is unknown whether these events were 
related to the effects of multiple sclerosis, to ponesimod, or to a 
combination of both. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No clear predisposing factors for convulsions could be identified.

Important Potential Risk: Unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (PRES, 
ADEM, atypical MS relapses) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) have been 
reported in subjects treated with ponesimod during the clinical 
development program. However, rare cases of PRES have been 
reported in patients receiving other S1P receptor modulators. 
In clinical trials of another S1P receptor modulator, rare events 
involving the nervous system, including ischemic and hemorrhagic 
strokes and neurological atypical disorders such as ADEM-like 
events, occurred in patients treated at higher doses. 
Many patients with PRES have potentially severe comorbidities 
such as bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, chronic renal 
failure, and chronic hypertension, which may be predisposing 
factors. Infections and autoimmune disease have also been 
associated with PRES. Hypertension of renal origin has been 
reported to be a significant cause of PRES, and patients with renal 
dysfunction appear to be at higher risk of developing PRES. 
 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
• 
• 
SmPC Section 4.4 
PL Section 2 
•  A complete physical and neurological examination should be 
scheduled in ponesimod-treated patients who develop any 
unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs, any 
symptom/sign suggestive of an increase of intracranial 
pressure, or accelerated neurological deterioration, and 
magnetic resonance imaging should be considered, as 
described in SmPC Section 4.4. 
• 
• 
• 
If PRES is suspected, ponesimod treatment should be 
discontinued, as described in SmPC Section 4.4. 
Patients who experience symptoms suggestive of PRES 
should call their physician immediately, as described in PL 
Section 2.

Ponesimod Pregnancy Outcomes Enhanced Monitoring (POEM). 
Purpose of the study: To evaluate the potential risk of reproductive and embryofetal toxicity in 
pregnant women exposed to ponesimod. 
The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  prospectively  collect  and  evaluate  safety  data  on  pregnancy 
outcomes  and  on  the  risk  of  birth  defects  in  the  offspring  of  women  exposed  to  ponesimod 
immediately before (up to 1 week before last menstrual period) and during pregnancy. 
AC-058B303/OPTIMUM-LT - Multicenter, non-comparative extension to study AC-058B301, 
to  investigate  the  long-term  safety,  tolerability,  and  control  of  disease  of  ponesimod  20  mg  in 
subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis. 
Purpose of the study: To characterize the long-term safety of ponesimod and control of disease in 
subjects with RMS and to investigate the effect on disease activity in a relatively large population 
after a brief interruption. 
The objectives of this trial are to describe the long-term safety and tolerability of ponesimod 20 mg 
in  subjects  with  RMS  as  well  as  the  effects  of  re-initiation  of  ponesimod  treatment  after 
interruption in subjects with RMS. 
 
AC-058B202  -  Multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group  extension  to  study 
AC-058B201  to  investigate  the  long-term  safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  10,  20,  and 
40 mg/day ponesimod, an oral S1P1 receptor agonist, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis. 
Purpose of the study: To investigate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ponesimod. 
The objective of this trial is to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of ponesimod. 
Survey among healthcare professionals (neurologists treating patients with MS along with 
MS specialist nurses) in selected European countries to evaluate knowledge and behaviors 
required for the safe use of ponesimod. 
Purpose  of  the  study:  To  assess  the  effectiveness  of  HCP  and  patient/caregiver  educational 
materials  (ie,  healthcare  professional  checklist,  patient/caregiver  guide,  and  pregnancy-specific 
patient reminder card) aimed at minimizing important risks. 
The objective of the survey of HCPs is to determine the effectiveness of HCP and patient/caregiver 
educational  materials.  The  survey  will  evaluate  whether  the  target  audience  received  the 
educational  materials,  and  will  assess  the  HCP’s  knowledge  and  HCP’s  perception  of  the 
patient’s/caregiver’s  knowledge  of  key  messages  for  the  safe  use  of  ponesimod,  and  behaviors 
associated with safety concerns covered by the educational materials.

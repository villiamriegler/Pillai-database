1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AveXis EU limited, submitted on 9 October 2018 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zolgensma, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
Zolgensma, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1509 on 19 June 2015 in the 
following condition: Treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. 
Zolgensma was granted eligibility to PRIME on 26 January 2017 in the following indication: Treatment 
of paediatric patients diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
•  SMA is a devastating condition for which there was no approved therapy at the time PRIME 
eligibility was granted. Treatment options were palliative and limited to nutritional and ventilatory 
support, with management focused on pulmonary complications and orthopaedic care. 
• 
The non-clinical programme had yielded results supportive of the expected mechanism of action 
with positive effects demonstrated in mice on survival, body weight, righting behaviour, and 
improved cardiac function.  
•  Additionally, it had been demonstrated that the vector had the ability to cross the blood brain 
barrier in two species (mice and cynomolgus Macaques) following IV administration. 
• 
The preliminary clinical observations following Zolgensma’s administration include positive impact 
on survival, pulmonary function, nutritional support, preservation of motor function and the 
attainment of development milestones, all of which were unexpected within the framework of the 
natural history and disease progression for SMA Type 1. These clinically meaningful responses in 
the patients treated with Zolgensma were sufficient preliminary clinical evidence of treatment 
effect that had the potential to address an unmet need in this devastating paediatric disease.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: ZOLGENSMA is indicated for a single treatment of 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1. The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that onasemnogene abeparvovec was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Zolgensma as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s 
website: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Zolgensma   
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0162/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP)   
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 6/150 
 
  
 
 
 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0162/2019 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation and Accelerated assessment 
The  applicant  requested  consideration  of  its  application  for  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The  applicant  requested  the  active  substance  onasemnogene  abeparvovec  contained  in  the  above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon  granting  of  eligibility  to  PRIME,  Johannes  Hendrikus  Ovelgönne  was  appointed  by  the  CHMP  as 
Rapporteur. 
A  kick-off  meeting  was  held  on  15  May  2017.  The  objective  of  the  meeting  was  to  discuss  the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address  the  following  key  issues  through  relevant  regulatory  procedures:  changes  to  manufacturing 
process,  potential  studies  on  nonclinical  model  to  investigate  different  doses  and  routes  of 
administration, target population and proposed indication, route of administration and choice of dose, 
maintenance of the effect and retreatment, plans for post-authorisation long-term follow-up of efficacy 
and safety and regulatory aspects.

The initial and follow-up advice in 2017 concerned clinical questions while in 2018, the applicant asked 
questions related to the quality and pre-clinical development.  
The Protocol assistance pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
•  Acceptability of the design of the open-label, single-arm, single-dose, historical-controlled, multi-
centre Phase 3 study in Europe to support a MAA filing for the treatment of SMA Type 1 regarding 
efficacy and safety. 
•  Agreement that the initial marketing authorisation would be based on data from newborn infants 
and infants with SMA Type 1, who at time of initial gene therapy would be six months of age or 
younger as well as on the overall clinical development program. 
• 
Further, it was discussed if the design of the proposed global multi-center phase 2/3 open label, 
natural-history  controlled  protocol,  involving  a  single,  one-time  dose  of  Zolgensma  delivered 
intravenously  to  infants  with  genetically  diagnosed  and  pre-symptomatic  SMA  with  multiple 
copies of SMN2 (Protocol AVXS-101-CL-304)  would be acceptable to support an MAA in a broad 
SMA  indication.  The  design  aspects  discussed  pertained  to  the  historical  control,  patient 
population,  sample  size,  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  and  the  approach  for  statistical 
analysis and dose. 
• 
The  applicant  also  asked  whether  the  Agency  agreed  that  assuming  the  results  from  a 
comparability assessment between the Phase 1 and Phase 3 product would be acceptable, if the 
product could meet the requirements for a marketing authorisation with the ongoing trials as a 
post authorisation commitment or a conditional marketing authorisation.  
Quality and pre-clinical: 
• 
In 2018, the comparability protocol approach to link the product used in the Phase 1 study with 
the product intended to be used in the Phase 3 study and in the proposed commercial process 
was discussed. Specific questions were asked regarding the list of attributes, acceptance criteria, 
the proposed manufacturing and testing approach, stability program for active substance and 
finished  product,  shelf-life,  quantitative  potency  assay  development  and  qualification  plan, 
release testing. 
• 
The  non-clinical  question  concerned  the  overall  non-clinical  development.  There  was  also  a 
multidisciplinary question asking if the Agency agreed that the comparability approach which will 
be available at time of the MAA submission, could be sufficient to support the quality part of the 
MAA.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication is treatment of (5q) spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1.  
The  term  SMA  is  applied  to  a  diverse  group  of  genetic  disorders,  all  of  which  affect  the  spinal  motor 
neuron. The most common form of SMA results from bi-allelic mutations to the survival motor neuron 1 
(SMN1) gene on chromosome 5q13 (5q SMA) of which the majority are homozygous deletions.  
5q SMA is conventionally classified into four phenotypes on the basis of age of onset and highest motor 
function achieved, with an additional phenotype (type 0) to describe the severe forms of antenatal-onset 
spinal muscular atrophy. 
5q SMA Type 1 patients never attain independent sitting and have onset of symptoms within the first 6 
months of life. 
The  clinical  studies  to  support  the  indication  focused  on  a  homogeneous  cohort  of  patients  with 
unequivocal  SMA  “Type  1”,  based  on  the  combination  of  clinical  diagnosis  (symptom  onset  prior  to  6 
months of age, hypotonia) and genotype (all enrolled patients were confirmed to have bi-allelic SMN1 
gene deletions and only 2 SMN2 copies without the known SMN2 genetic modifier).  
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 10/150 
 
  
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
SMA  (5q)  is  an  autosomal  recessive,  early  childhood  disease  with  an  incidence  of  approximately  1: 
10,000  live  births,  of  which  approximately  45-60%  of  cases  are  SMA  Type 1,  the  most  severe  form. 
Spinal muscular atrophy is the leading cause of infant mortality due to genetic disease.  
There are limited treatment options for patients with SMA. Until recently, no causal treatment existed. 
Complications derived by SMA caused muscle weakness were addressed by multidisciplinary medical and 
supportive  care, 
including  orthopedic  and  spinal  management,  nutritional,  swallowing  and 
gastrointestinal  management,  pulmonary  management,  acute  care,  and  palliative  care.  The  2007 
published  consensus  statement  for  standard  of  care  in  SMA  (Wang  et  al.,  J  Child  Neurol,  2007)  was 
updated in 2017 due to improvements in many aspects of care for infants in children with SMA (Mercuri 
et al., Neuromusc Dis, 2018; Finkel et al, Neuromusc. Dis, 2018).  
On the basis of available newborn screening, in 2018 a treatment algorithm for infants diagnosed with 
5q  SMA  through  Newborn  Screening  has  been  published  (Glascock  et  al.,  J  Neuromusc  Dis,  2018), 
however,  newborn  screening  for  5q  SMA  is  not  an  implemented  standard  throughout  Europe  yet. 
Initiation of treatment is recommended even for pre-symptomatic 5q SMA patients that by genotype are 
likely to develop 5q SMA Types 1 or 2.  
An approved causal treatment has become available only recently, when in late 2016 (23 December) 
and  mid-2017,  the  United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (U.S.  FDA)  and  European  Medicines 
Agency (EMA), respectively approved Spinraza® (nusinersen), an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug 
designed to increase the production of the SMN protein by modulating the splicing of the SMN2 gene, 
thereby  compensating  for  the  underlying  genetic  defect.  Spinraza®  is  administered  intrathecally;  an 
induction  period  is  followed  by  life-long  repeated  intrathecal  administrations.  Despite  marketing 
authorisation of Spinraza®, an unmet medical need for alternative treatment options of 5q SMA remains. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Spinal  muscular  atrophy  is  a  motor  neuron  disease  for  which  the  root  cause  is  a  protein  deficiency 
affecting a neuronal network with variable clinical thresholds (16). Motor neuron survival depends among 
others on a protein named survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is deficient in 5q SMA. Deficiency 
of SMN protein correlates directly with death of the individual’s motor neurons. Loss of motor neurons 
leads to secondary effects on muscle strength and function, leading to progressive loss of muscle control, 
strength and function, swallowing, breathing and, ultimately, death for untreated 5q SMA Type 1. 
The most common form of SMA results from bi-allelic mutations to the survival motor neuron 1 gene 
(SMN1) on chromosome 5q13 (5q SMA); of these 5q SMA cases, 95% are due to homozygous deletions, 
with  the  remainder  being  hemizygous  deletions  with  a  point  mutation  on  the  other  chromosome.  In 
humans,  2 forms  of  the  SMN  gene  exist:  a  telomeric  form  (SMN1)  and  a  centromeric  form  (survival 
motor  neuron 2  gene  [SMN2]).  Transcription  of  the  SMN1  gene  produces  full-length  messenger  RNA 
(mRNA) transcripts that encode the SMN protein, necessary for motor neuron survival. The SMN2 gene 
is  nearly  identical  to  the  SMN1  gene.  A  C  to  T  substitution  at  position  840  results  in  the  preferential 
exclusion  of  exon 7  from  most  of  the  transcriptional  product.  The  resultant  truncated  protein  is  not 
functional. Only a small percentage (i.e., approximately 10% to 15% of the protein product of SMN2) is 
in the form of the full-length, functional SMN protein. 
Individuals  with  SMA  lack  a  normally  functioning  SMN1  gene  and  are  thus  dependent  on  their  SMN2 
gene. In SMA patients lacking functional SMN1, the SMN2 copy number is inversely related to the clinical 
severity,  with  a  higher  number  of  copies  associated  with  less  severe  disease.  SMN1  is  ubiquitously 
expressed. It is unclear why motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to SMN1 deficiency. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 11/150 
 
  
 
 
Although the primary pathology of SMA is neurodegeneration at the level of the spinal motor neuron, 
some clinical reports indicate the involvement of other organs to include the heart, liver, pancreas and 
intestine.  Metabolic  deficiencies  including  hyperglycaemia  and  hypoglycaemia  have  been  reported  as 
well. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Several phenotypes of SMA have historically been described based on age at onset and maximal motor 
function  achieved,  although  there  is  a  consensus  that  these  phenotypes  represent  a  continuum  from 
extremely severe, with disease symptoms manifesting in utero, to very mild symptoms with onset during 
later life. SMA type 1 presents itself with unexplained weakness or hypotonia. Molecular genetic testing 
with targeted mutation analysis can confirm the diagnosis of SMA. 
On the basis of available newborn screening, in 2018 a treatment algorithm for infants diagnosed with 
5q  SMA  through  Newborn  Screening  has  been  published  (Glascock  et  al.,  J  Neuromusc  Dis,  2018), 
however, newborn screening for 5q SMA is not an implemented standard throughout Europe yet. The 
algorithm  recommends  initiation  of  treatment  even  for  pre-symptomatic  5q  SMA  patients  that  by 
genotype are likely to develop 5q SMA Type 1.’  
The difference in severity between the SMA types is largely accounted for by SMN2 copy number, with 
other genetic or environmental factors playing a minor role only.   Individuals born with ≤ 3 copies of 
SMN2 in the presence of a bi-allelic SMN1 deletion or mutation have a high probability of developing a 
severe  phenotype  which,  untreated,  will  result  in  significant  motor  function  limitations  including  the 
inability to walk, high risk for respiratory complications requiring some degree of ventilatory support, 
high risk for orthopaedic complications such as often painful contractures and scoliosis, and truncated 
life expectancy. 
The combination of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics led to the subdivision in SMA types 
presented in Table 1.  
SMA Type 1 is the most common form of SMA, representing 45% to 60% of cases. The prognosis for 
patients with SMA Type 1 with 2 copies of SMN2 is particularly dire; these patients show signs of the 
disease soon after birth (<6 months of age), never gain the ability to sit, and typically do not survive 
past 2 years of age without significant mechanical ventilatory and nutritional support.

2.1.5.  Management 
About the product 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered  to  be  of  major  public  health  interest.  SMA  Type  1  is  a  severe  and  rapidly  progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder, which without treatment will result in a life expectancy of less than two 
years. Since not all SMA subjects respond to nusinersen, there is an unmet medical need in treatment 
of SMA. The first results of Zolgensma with regard to survival, survival-free-of-ventilatory-support, and 
reaching  motor  milestones  were  considered  promising.  In  addition,  the  mode  of  administration  of 
Zolgensma  (single  intravenous  infusion)  and  dose  regime  (only  once)  was  considered  a  clinically 
relevant advantage as compared to the repeated intrathecal injections of nusinersen. 
However, during assessment the CAT and CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as the dossier presented deficiencies in many aspects of the Quality and Clinical 
presentation:  With  regards  to  the  quality  dossier,  among  others  Major  Objections  were  proposed 
pertaining  to  the  following  issues:  control  of  genetic  integrity  of  the  vector,  comparability  of  the 
manufacturing processes and potency assay. In relation to the clinical dossier, Major Objections were 
identified  in  relation  to  the  amount  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  available  with  the  commercial 
manufacturing process and the indication wording. 
In addition, given the irreversible motor neuron loss in SMA, the CAT agreed to convene a SAG discuss 
the patient population expected to benefit most from treatment with Zolgensma. 
Therefore, the evaluation reverted to standard timetable. 
The applicant also requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
The benefit-risk balance is positive and Zolgensma is designed to address the monogenic root cause of 
SMA by replacing the defective SMN1 gene resulting in increased levels of SMN protein. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data:  
Data from Studies CL-303, CL-302 and CL-304 are anticipated to address the uncertainties of an initial 
CMA based on preliminary data from the ongoing phase III studies and on CL-101. Pivotal Study CL-303 
has a combined primary efficacy endpoint, has been completed as of 31 DEC 2019 and the final Clinical 
Study Report is expected to be available for submission in September 2020. In addition, the quality of 
data  generated  in  Study  CL-303  and  the  remaining  studies  in  the  Zolgensma  clinical  development 
program (including Study CL-302 and CL-304) will not be affected by approval of its CMA as all studies 
are open-label, single-arm trials and, therefore, study blinding (i.e. none) and statistical analyses will 
not be compromised. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed: 
Although  another  available  treatment  option  is  nusinersen,  nusinersen  treatment  is  associated  with 
significant burden for the patient since it requires lifelong intrathecal injection, which is associated with 
safety risks. Zolgensma effectively targets the disease mechanism in 5q SMA, has improved efficacy and 
a more convenient method of administration when compared to those of nusinersen; and has at least a 
comparable safety profile to that of nusinersen. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 13/150 
 
  
 
 
Whilst the confirmatory Study CL-303 is completed as of 31 DEC 2019, the final CSR is awaited. Early 
access to this innovative treatment option would be highly important for especially SMA Type 1 patients, 
which without treatment will result in a life expectancy of less than two years. In 2017, nusinersen was 
authorised as a disease-modifying treatment resulting in advances in SMA patient care and outcomes. 
However, not all treated patients have improved their muscular functions as demonstrated by the ability 
to sit or walk unassisted.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for infusion containing 2.0 x 10e13 vg/mL of 
onasemnogene abeparvovec as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: tromethamine, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and poloxamer 188, 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and water for injection.  
The product is available in 10 mL crystal zenith vials with a nominal fill volume of 5.5 mL or 8.3 mL. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Zolgensma is a single-dose, preservative-free, sterile, clear to slightly opaque, and colourless to faint 
white, intravenous infusion of non-replicating, self-complementary AAV9 vector. Zolgensma contains the 
human  survival  motor  neuron  gene  (SMN1)  under  the  control  of  the  cytomegalovirus  (CMV) 
enhancer/chicken-β-actin-hybrid promoter (CB). One of the two adeno-associated vector (AAV) inverted 
terminal repeats (ITRs) has been modified to promote intramolecular annealing of the transgene, thus 
forming  a  double-stranded  transgene  ready  for  transcription.  The  size  of  the  packaged  self-
complementary vector genome is ~4.6 kb.   
The capsid is comprised of 60 viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3) in a ratio of approximately 1:1:10 that are 
derived from the AAV serotype 9. The capsid proteins are produced by alternate splicing such that VP2 
and VP3 are two truncated forms of VP1, all with common C-terminal sequences. The predicted molecular 
weights of VP1, VP2 and VP3 are 81.4, 66.3 and 59.8 kDa respectively.  
The onasemnogene abeparvovec AS (active substance) is a clear, to slightly opaque, colourless to faint 
white solution at a concentration of 3.4 to 7.3 x 10e13 vector genome-containing particles per millilitre.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturing facilities 
The manufacture of onasemnogene abeparvovec takes place at AveXis, Inc., Libertyville, IL 60048, USA. 
The site has been inspected by HPRA and is covered by a GMP certificate. 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Zolgensma AS is a complex process involving several steps in upstream 
and downstream manufacturing, whereby the maximum duration of all steps leads to an overall process 
time of several days.  
The AS Upstream manufacturing process consists of five steps, or unit operations: 1) Cell Expansion, 
2) Bioreactor Operations, 3) Bioreactor Harvest, 4) Harvest Clarification, and 5) Intermediate.   
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 14/150 
 
  
 
 
During Upstream manufacturing, one vial of the human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) working cell 
bank (WCB) is thawed, and cells are expanded. The expanded cells are harvested and used to inoculate 
the bioreactor. The cells expanded are transfected with a triple DNA plasmid solution. After cell culture, 
the cells are harvested and clarified. The clarified harvest is processed to Intermediate and frozen. All 
open cell/product manipulations in the Upstream manufacturing process occur inside a biosafety cabinet 
(BSC) within an ISO 7 area. Media, solutions, and buffers that are prepared by AveXis are prepared in 
an ISO 8 area. 
The  AS  Downstream  manufacturing  process  includes  thawing  and  pooling  of  the  intermediate, 
clarification process, chromatographic purification step, filtration and centrifugation steps and filling of 
the AS. No reprocessing is allowed. 
Overall, the manufacturing process is well described including detailed flow charts. In-process controls 
are in line with the expectations.  
Control of Source and Starting Materials of Biological Origin  
The  Starting  Materials  for  onasemnogene  abeparvovec  consist  of  a  mammalian  cell  bank  and  three 
recombinant plasmids. An overview of raw materials used in the manufacturing of the active substance 
has  been  provided  including  information on  their  intended  use,  whether  they  are  compendial or  non-
compendial, and specifications for non-compendial material. Information on the vendors of critical raw 
materials is provided. Specifications and representative certificates of analysis are provided. 
For the starting materials, information on the source, history, and generation of the plasmids and the 
cell banks has been provided. The applicant used a vial of HEK 293 cells to create a pre-MCB (master 
cell bank). Subsequently a MCB and three WCBs (working cell banks) were manufactured under GMP. 
All three generated WCBs will be used for manufacture of clinical and commercial material.  
Zolgensma AS is produced by co-transfection of HEK293 cells withthree plasmids:  
• Vector Plasmid (pSMN)  
• AAV Plasmid (pAAV2/9) containing the AAV rep2 and cap9 wild-type genes   
• Adenovirus Helper Plasmid (pHELP).   
Plasmid DNA maps are provided. The plasmid manufacturing and testing sites are provided. 
The  tests  and/or  acceptance  criteria  for  the  plasmid  DNA  batches  manufactured  by  the  two  plasmid 
production sites show some differences, which have been sufficiently justified. An overview was provided 
of the plasmid DNA batches (manufacturer and batch number) that have been used for the production 
of the different commercial AS batches listed in the MAA. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Tabular overviews of the critical and key process parameters (CPPs and KPPs), in process controls (IPCs) 
and  in  process  acceptance  criteria  (IPACs),  including  their  respective  ranges,  action  limits,  and 
acceptance criteria are provided.  
Relative  wide  operating  ranges  are  defined  for  some  of  the  key  process  parameters  and  IPCs;  the 
applicant committed to periodically evaluate key and critical operating ranges as well as action limits.  
The selection of in process tests is acceptable.   
Validation  
The Applicant completed consecutive process verification runs at commercial scale for each of the three 
manufacturing  stages  (cell  expansion,  intermediates  and  downstream  manufacturing).  A  total  of  five 
runs  were  executed  under  the  vial  thaw  and  cell  expansion  protocol.  Five  runs  through  Intermediate 
were executed using a small-scale bioreactor, and three runs were executed using the commercial scale 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 15/150 
 
  
 
 
bioreactor.  Four  process  verification  batches  were  executed  for the  downstream  process.  Overall,  the 
pre-defined acceptance criteria were met for most of the process parameters with only few exceptions, 
which had no impact on forward processing.  
Development 
Research preparations of Zolgensma were used for non-clinical studies and/or proof of concept studies. 
Details regarding manufacturing and release testing are not provided. As it is claimed that these non-
clinical studies were repeated with material from Process B the absence of information regarding research 
preparations is accepted.     
Two different processes, A and B, have been used to manufacture vectors for clinical evaluation. One 
batch is manufactured at a research institute, called Process A. Only this Process A batch is used in the 
Phase 1 clinical study that supports the present application.  
Subsequent  batches  are  referred  to  as  Process  B  batches  and  claimed  to  be  manufactured  with  the 
commercial  process.  However,  the  upstream  manufacturing  of  the  first  two  Process  B  AS  lots  was 
performed in 2017 at a different site prior to transferring the upstream process to AveXis were also the 
downstream  Process  B  takes  place.  The  manufacturing  site  of  AveXis  at  Libertyville,  IL,  USA  is  the 
commercial manufacturing site of Zolgensma. 
Overall the changes between upstream process A and process B are sufficiently described and related to 
the change of production sites, upscaling and introduction of bioreactor, change of equipment, as well 
as  process  optimisation  and  improvement  of  robustness  and  consistency.  The  changes  for  the 
downstream  Process  B  were  extensive  and  Process  A  and  Process  B  are  not  comparable  as  such.  In 
addition a MCB/WCB of HEK293 cells was introduced for Process B and the slightly modified plasmids 
were manufactured by a commercial supplier. Due to changes during development and with the data 
provided, it cannot be demonstrated that the Process A batch at the time of its manufacturing / clinical 
use is comparable to the Process B batches. The assessment of the benefit risk of Zolgensma therefore 
needs to be based on the clinical data obtained with Process B batches. 
Comparability of the Process B batches is discussed in the Finished Product section below. 
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
The active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-
the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure. The analytical results 
are consistent with the proposed structure. 
The characterisation study commences with a purification by gradient centrifugation of one Process B 
FP batch to produce a band profile. Each band of proposed full capsid material was isolated and further 
characterized by SDS-PAGE analysis, genomic (RNA/DNA) isolation, in vitro SMN expression analysis, 
residual DNA analysis, genomic titre by PCR, total protein content, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) 
and sequencing.  
The analysis of the capsid proteins suggests slight differences in residual DNA levels and capsid protein 
ratio among the bands. The isolated bands are shown to be capable of transducing cells and expressing 
the encoded SMN gene indicating the presence of functional and infectious particles.  
It remains to be demonstrated whether ratio of the bands and capsid protein ratio are comparable 
among batches and how the ratio is affected by the production process. The applicant committed to 
performing additional studies to characterize bands.    
The  results  from  the  forced  degradation  study  demonstrate  the  sensitivity  of  Zolgensma  to  acid 
hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, and oxidation. Zolgensma is not sensitive to light.  
EMA/200482/2020

Impurities 
The concentrations of process-related impurities were measured at various stages of the manufacturing 
process  to  evaluate  the  level  of  removal.  Process-related  impurities  were  shown  to  be  reduced  to 
acceptable concentrations.  
Data  on  product-related  impurities  has  been  provided  and  is  based  on  forced  degradation  studies 
summarised in the stability section. Empty capsids and rcAAV are controlled during AS release and thus 
no additional characterisation data are required for these impurities.  
Upon request, further information was provided on the control of aggregates. Preliminary data support 
that Zolgensma may not be prone to aggregate formation and aggregates could be detected by SV-AUC. 
Further evaluation, however, showed that the latter method is not adequate for monitoring aggregates. 
The applicant committed to further develop quantitative aggregation assay and include this test in the 
stability test panel once validated.   
The applicant committed to determine the amount of co-packaged cap, rep, host cell DNA and adenoviral 
sequences. 
Specification,  analytical  procedures,  reference  standards,  batch  analysis, 
and container closure 
Specifications 
Release test results from 20 consecutive Zolgensma AS lots manufactured by the proposed commercial 
process  were  evaluated  to  develop  the  proposed  acceptance  criteria.  The  data  demonstrates  the 
consistency of the AS lot yield as measured by the total number of vector produced.  
The AS specifications are defined based on manufacturing and clinical experience, and pharmacopoeia 
standards.  Active  substance  is  tested  for  pH,  appearance,  osmolality,  titre,  identity,  impurities,  and 
microbiological attributes.  
Overall the specifications of the AS are sufficiently justified. A commitment is provided to develop a more 
sensitive  and  precise  method  for  analysis  of  protein  impurities  and  re-evaluate  the  specifications  for 
impurities based on the sensitivity of the new method.  
Analytical procedures 
Summaries of the analytical method principles, detailed SOPs and validation reports are provided. All 
methods have been validated in line with ICH Q2.  
Reference standard 
Due to the similarity in formulation of AS and FP, the FP reference material can be deployed for testing 
of AS as well as FP. Reference standards are further described with the FP. 
Container closure system 
The AS is stored in sterile bottles. Bottles are filled and frozen. Sufficient information on the AS container 
closure  system  is  provided,  including  specifications  and  technical  drawings.  The  extractables  and 
leachables studies support the use of bottles for the storage of Zolgensma AS.  
Stability 
The AS stability study comprises tests for Appearance, pH, Osmolality, Genomic Titre, Purity and Total 
Impurities. Stability acceptance criteria are the same as release criteria. Small containers representative 
of the actual AS containers were used for storage. Long-term primary stability studies at the long-term 
storage condition are ongoing for the active substance process B lots manufactured at Avexis.  
In addition, the applicant committed to develop methods to detect aggregates and improve detection 
of degradation products.

2.2.1.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Zolgensma  finished  product  is  a  single-dose,  preservative-free,  sterile,  clear  to  slightly  opaque,  and 
colourless to faint white, intravenous infusion of non-replicating, self-complementary AAV9 vector at a 
target concentration of 2.0 x 1013 vg/mL.  
Zolgensma FP solution in Water for Injection (WFI) contains Tromethamine (Tris), Magnesium Chloride, 
Sodium Chloride, and Poloxamer 188. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. Zolgensma FP is filled into 10 mL crystal zenith vials with a nominal fill volume of 5.5 mL or 
8.3 mL and stored at ≤ -60°C. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Zolgensma AS contains the same buffer excipient matrix that is used for the concentration adjustment 
of Zolgensma FP. The justification for the formulation of Zolgensma is sufficient. The dossier contains a 
detailed justification for the selection of the excipients and their functionality. 
Physicochemical and biological properties 
Information is provided on the vector quantity, finished product density, potency and its control. 
Manufacturing process development 
Process changes 
Three finished product manufacturing processes are described: Process A (manufactured at a research 
institute), Process B-initial, and Process B-commercial (both manufactured at Avexis). Only one clinical 
batch manufactured according to Process A is listed, which was used in the Phase I clinical study that 
supports the present application; the batches manufactured according to Process B–initial were used in 
development  and  in  the  ongoing  pivotal  clinical  trial.  Batches  manufactured  according  to  Process  B-
commercial were used for process validation and used in clinical studies. 
The finished product presentation is different for each process with regard to container closure system, 
fill volume, and vector concentration. These changes were implemented to support long-term storage 
and  achieve  the  desired  dose  and  dose  volumes.  With  regard  to  the  finished  product  manufacturing 
process, the main difference is the presence of an active substance thaw step in Process A and Process 
B–commercial, which is not present in Process B–initial. Manual filling in Process A was replaced by an 
automated filler in Process B-initial and -commercial.  
Comparability 
As discussed in the section on Active Substance, no conclusions can be drawn on comparability between 
the Process A batch and Process B batches. The assessment of the benefit risk of Zolgensma therefore 
needs to be based on the clinical data obtained with Process B batches. 
At D150, no comparability assessment of Finished Product manufactured according to Process B-initial 
and Process B-commercial had been performed It was noted that the available batch analysis data of 
Process B batches showed no obvious differences, to Process A batches. However, the infectious titre 
per 1013 vg showed relatively large batch-to-batch variation, and comparison of the data was hampered 
by changes that were made to the test methods and not justified by data demonstrating that the revised 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 18/150 
 
  
 
 
methods yielded equivalent results. Also, stability data for the Process A batch suggested that a shift in 
the measured titre may have occurred during development due to a change in method. 
As  accurate  dosing  of  Zolgensma  is  critical,  additional  data  were  requested  to  address  above 
uncertainties and demonstrate assurance of comparability of the Process B-batches with regard to vector 
titre and infectivity.  
The response of the applicant showed that only a Phase I clinical batch is impacted by the shift in the 
measured titre due to a change in the analytical method. All Phase 3 clinical batches and PPQ/commercial 
batches were tested using the revised test method and show consistent genomic titre. Also, additional 
data are provided to demonstrate that the batch-to-batch variation in infectious titre calculated per 1013 
vg can be attributed to assay variability. Infectivity of the batches may, however, also be deduced from 
the  in  vitro  relative  potency  assay,  that  measures  protein  expression  relative  to  a  finished  product 
reference  batch  (see  below).  Finally,  preliminary  data  on  the  impact  of  freeze-thaw  are  provided.  No 
impact on product quality is observed, however, further studies, including additional batches and also 
evaluating potential aggregation, should be performed to confirm this result. A commitment was provided 
by the applicant to perform these studies.   
The applicant demonstrates that the relative protein expression measured in the in vitro potency assay 
closely correlates with the relative infectivity (percentage positive cells) in the in vitro potency assay. It 
is  therefore  in  principle  agreed  that  the  in  vitro  relative  potency  assay  is  used  to  control  lot-to-lot 
consistency  of  the  effective  dose  (i.e.  the  amount  of  administered  particles  that  are  capable  of 
transducing cells). However, careful monitoring of the reference standard stability and its performance 
is required to ensure adequate and consistent potency control. Control Strategy 
A risk-based approach was adopted for the assignment of CQA’s. In general, the identified CQAs are the 
parameters tested for active substance and finished product release. This can be accepted.       
A process parameter risk assessment was performed via Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The 
approach used to determine criticality of process parameters can in general be accepted.  Operational 
range for critical (CPPs) and key (KPPs) process parameters are sufficiently justified.     
Processing/hold durations can be accepted as they are either below 24 hours or supported by process 
validation data. The duration of sterile filtration and filling are identified as CPP.  
Container Closure System 
Sufficient information on the selection of the container closure system is provided. The selected container 
closure  system  is  expected  to  be  suitable  for  its  intended  use.  Characterisation  studies  confirmed 
container  closure  integrity.  Compatibility  of  the  finished  product  with  the  container  closure  system 
(extractables and leachable testing) and of the finished product with a syringe and infusion set that are 
needed for administration to the patient was evaluated. The provided information gives no reason for 
concern. Overall, storage in the respective syringe for 8 h and infusion duration of 60 min is supported.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
Manufacturers, contract testing laboratories and contract storage sites for the Finished Product are listed 
in  table  6  below.  GMP  compliance  for  Avexis  Inc.  and  contract  laboratories  involved  in  manufacture, 
testing  and  storage  of  Zolgensma  was  confirmed.    Import  of  the  FP,  secondary  packaging,  EU  batch 
certification, and storage and distribution is performed by Almac Pharma Services Ltd., Ireland.   
The Applicant has provided a justification, in accordance with paragraph 11.17 of  Guidelines on Good 
Manufacturing Practice specific to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (Eudralex The Rules Governing 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 19/150 
 
  
 
 
Medicinal  Products  in  the  European  Union,  Volume  4,  Good  Manufacturing  Practice),  to  rely  on  the 
finished product release testing performed in the US, claiming a limited amount of material available.  
The CAT agreed to the justification given by the applicant that in view of the current small batch size 
which  is  limited  due  to  the  batch  allocation  strategy,  re-testing  in  the  EU  would  consume  a 
disproportionate amount of this batch size. Therefore, the current testing plan has been accepted for 
this specific small batch size. Should the applicant consider a batch upscaling or registration of new sites 
in the future, omission of the batch release re-testing in the EU will need to be re-considered.  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  considered  adequate.  A  detailed  description  of  the 
manufacturing process is provided, including a flow diagram and narrative of how each step is performed. 
Briefly,  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process consists  of  active  substance  thawing  and  pooling, 
sterile  filtration  and  concentration  adjustment,  filling,  visual  inspection,  labelling  and  secondary 
packaging. Tabular overviews of the critical and key process parameters (CPPs and KPPs), in process 
controls (IPCs) and in process acceptance criteria (IPACs), including their respective ranges, action limits, 
and acceptance criteria are provided. The selection of in process tests is acceptable. All unit operations 
in the finished product manufacturing process are identified as critical.  
During the filtration step, the active substance is diluted to reach the target concentration of 2.0 x 1013 
vg/mL (IPC).  
No intermediates are described in the finished product manufacturing process. In process-hold times are 
supported by process validation. 
Process validation and evaluation 
The Applicant completed four consecutive PPQ runs.  The manufacturing process was performed at set 
point conditions for the critical and key process parameters.  
Two out of four process verification runs were successfully completed (run 3 and 4). For these batches, 
all acceptance criteria for IPCs and Finished product release were met. In process verification run 2, the 
sterile  filtration  had  to  be  repeated  due  to  a  system  leak  prior  to  filling.  Reprocessing  of  the  sterile 
filtration step is validated (see above); the release specifications were met in PPQ run 2. In PPQ run 1, 
the acceptance criterion for titre after the sterile filtration/concentration adjustment step (IPC) was not 
met.  An  additional  filtration  step  and  sterile  filtration  were  performed  to  correct  the  titre.  This 
reprocessing option had  also  been  included  in  the  manufacturing  process  description  but  was  deleted 
upon request.  
Overall,  the  provided  validation  data  show  that,  when  operating  at  set-point  conditions,  the 
manufacturing  process  is  capable  to  consistently  yield  a  product  meeting  its  predefined  acceptance 
criteria. Upon request, additional data were provided to further support the proposed operational ranges 
and manufacturing scale.  
The information provided on the additional validation studies (media fill studies, filter validation, shipping 
validation) in general give no reason for concern.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Finished product specifications 
Finished  product  is  tested  for  pH,  appearance,  osmolality,  titre,  impurities,  potency,  particulates  and 
microbiological attributes. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 20/150 
 
  
 
 
The proposed test panel for the finished product is acceptable, taking into account the commitment of 
the applicant.  
Analytical procedures 
Detailed descriptions of the analytical procedures deduced from the respective SOPs have been provided. 
The analytical procedures were adequately validated. 
Batch analysis 
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided,  including  data  from  Process  A,  Process  B-initial  batches,  the  PPQ 
batches (Process B-commercial), and Process B-commercial batches.  
Justification of specifications 
The Applicant has provided a detailed justification of the proposed acceptance criteria for each of the 
tests performed for finished product release. For quantitative criteria, a statistical analysis was performed 
and limits were set.   
In  response  to  the  request  to  determine  whether  tightening  of  the  FP  release  specifications  limits  is 
required to ensure optimal clinical outcome (Major Objection), the applicant has evaluated batch release 
data and the relation between clinical outcome and FP attributes. It is agreed that this evaluation did not 
identify a need to tighten the specifications. However, clinical data are considered currently too limited 
to  reach  a  final  conclusion.  The  applicant  committed  to  perform  a  further  evaluation  of  the  FP 
specifications when additional patient data are available.  
Due  to  the  concerns  with  regard  to  stability  of  the  reference  standard,  the  applicant  was  asked  to 
demonstrate that the acceptance criterion for potency provides a suitable and consistent target potency 
(Major Objection). This issue is not fully solved. However, consistency of the potency measurement is 
further ensured by the committed implementation of an assay control and adequate monitoring of the 
reference standard stability and performance. In addition, as discussed above, the applicant will perform 
further evaluation of the acceptance criteria when additional patient data are available.  
Reference standard 
The finished product lot manufactured according to Process A was used as interim reference standard. 
Qualification was based on the release test panel that was in place at the time of manufacture.  
The  primary  reference  standard  is  qualified  by  release  testing  and  additional  testing.  As  part  of  the 
qualification, bridging with the interim reference standard was performed. The questions raised regarding 
the bridging approach were not solved but will not be pursued.  
The general approach that will be used for preparation and qualification of additional primary and working 
reference  standards  is  acceptable.  The  Applicant  acknowledged  that,  in  the  absence  of  an  approved 
protocol for the qualification and bridging of future reference standards, a variation application should 
be submitted for implementation of new reference standards. Stability of the reference standards will be 
confirmed by assay monitoring and requalification using a subset of release, stability and characterisation 
test methods.  
Container closure system 
The  primary  container  closure  system  for  Zolgensma  FP  is  a  clear  10  mL  crystal  zenith  vial  with  a 
chlorobutyl  elastomeric  stopper,  and  an  aluminium  seal  with  a  coloured  plastic  button  cap.  Sufficient 
information on the container closure system is provided, including specifications and technical drawing, 
and information on extractables/ leachables and microbiological attributes. Container closure integrity is 
confirmed. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 21/150 
 
  
 
 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with current ICH/CHMP guidelines.  
The stability test panel includes general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality), potency-related tests, purity, 
and container closure integrity. Upon request, a test for sub-visible particles was added to the long-term 
stability protocol. An aggregation assay is under development and will be added to the stability program 
once validated.   
The  available  long-term  stability  data  include  12-month  stability  data  for  PPQ,  supportive,  and 
commercial FP lots stored at <-60°C. All acceptance criteria are met, however, some downward trends 
have  been  observed.  The  applicant  committed  to  continuously  monitor  genomic  titre  change  during 
stability and evaluate the potential root cause.  
The shelf-life for Zolgensma FP at the long-term storage condition of < -60°C is 12 months. This can 
be  accepted,  but  the  shelf-life  should  be  re-evaluated  when  additional  stability  data  are  available, 
including data on aggregates and the outcome of the root-cause analysis.  All batches are also included 
in accelerated (2-8°C) and stressed (20-25°C) stability studies. 
The Zolgensma FP post-approval stability commitment is to continue the ongoing stability programs as 
described in Section 3.2.P.8.1 in support of the proposed shelf-life. Additionally, at least one Zolgensma 
FP commercial lot at each fill volume will be placed into the stability program annually at the long–term 
storage condition of ≤ -60°C. The stability data on which the summary and conclusion in P.8.1 is based, 
are included in the dossier. 
As stated in the SmPC the product should be stored in a refrigerator (2 -8°C) immediately upon receipt. 
Once thawed, the medicinal product should not be re-frozen and may be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 
8°C in the original carton for 14 days. Once the dose volume is drawn into the syringe it must be infused 
within 8 hours.  Discard the vector containing syringe if not infused within the 8-hour timeframe. 
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
N/A 
Adventitious agents 
The Applicant has provided a general overview of the adventitious agents safety evaluation, including 
information on the control of materials, the testing for potential adventitious agents, and viral clearance 
studies.  
Non-viral adventitious agents 
Control  of  contamination  of  the  manufacturing  facility  (e.g.  environmental  monitoring,  cleaning 
procedures) are briefly described in section 3.2.A.1; Media fill studies are described in section 3.2.P.3. 
and have been successfully performed.  
With  regard  to  the  testing  performed  for  non-viral  adventitious  agents,  for  cell  bank  testing,  and  the 
Active  substance  manufacturing  process  reference  is  made  to  CTD  section  3.2.S.2.3.  The  cell  banks 
tested negative for bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma. In process controls for bioburden and endotoxin are 
in place. The Active substance release tests include bioburden; Finished product is tested for sterility and 
endotoxin. The provided information suggests adequate control of non-viral adventitious agents.  
Compliance  with  the  “Note  for  guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal  spongiform 
encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products” (EMA/410/01 rev 03) has been 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 22/150 
 
  
 
 
sufficiently  shown  for  all  reagents  and  equipment  used  at  Zolgensma  manufacture  and  cell  bank 
generation. 
Viral adventitious agents 
Cell bank testing for viruses is described in CTD section 3.2.S.2.3. The commercial MCB is tested in line 
with ICH Q5A, including NAT test panels for human viruses and AAV, and in vitro assays for bovine and 
porcine viruses. WCBs are tested for viral contaminants in vitro using 3 cell lines.  
All cell banks were found negative for all viruses tested except for a low signal with the PERT assay. Even 
though such result is not unexpected for this highly sensitive assay, the applicant was asked to clarify if 
an infectivity assay has been performed as required by Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 under such conditions. In response, 
the applicant justified the retrovirus testing scheme and committed to perform an infectivity assay for 
the next MCB in case of positive Q-PERT assay. Upon request, the applicant also provided data on virus 
testing on end-of-production (EOP) cells derived from the current three WCBs.  
Production control cells, pre-lysed harvest and the intermediate are tested for viral contaminants in vitro, 
which is in line with Ph. Eur. and ICH Q5A. The Active Substance release tests include a test for rcAAV. 
A discussion of the risk of replication competent AAV is included in section 3.2.A. 
Animal and human derived material 
The  listed  animal  derived  materials  used  in  the  cell  bank  generation  and  cell  culture  are  serum,  cell 
disassociation agent, and production media containing human transferrin.  
The serum used is sourced from animals in New Zealand and gamma irradiated. A certificate of suitability 
was provided for the serum used at MCB and WCB manufacture and used for production.  
Production  medium  used  as  cell  culture  medium  after  transfection  contains  human  transferrin.  The 
source  plasma  is  collected  from  U.S.  donors  in  FDA  approved  centres,  thus  the  TSE  risk  is  deemed 
negligible. The information provided for human transferrin with regard to plasma testing (HIV 1/2 Ab, 
HCV  Ab,  HbsAg;  NAT  testing  for  HAV,  HBV,  HCV,  HIV-1  and  PB19)  and  virus  inactivation  procedures 
(heat treatment of the product for 10 hours at 60°C) is noted. Upon request, only transferrin for which 
information on quality and control is provided in line with Chapter 10 of the Guideline on plasma-derived 
medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/BWP/ 706271/2010) will be used in Zolgensma manufacture.  
Virus validation studies 
Virus  inactivation  and  clearance  studies  were  performed.  All  three  steps  were  validated  for  virus 
inactivation / removal in down scaled spiking studies. X-MuLV, PRV, HAV, and MVM were used as model 
viruses whose choice is acceptable. The down scaling was adequate. 
The results of the virus validation studies suggest that the manufacturing process is capable to effectively 
inactivate/remove enveloped viruses (log reduction > 8).

See section 2.3.4.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The manufacturing process of Zolgensma is sufficiently described and has been adequately validated at 
set point conditions.  
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 23/150 
 
  
 
 
Sufficient information is provided on the manufacturing of the plasmids and the generation of the HEK-
293 MCB and WCBs that are used for the manufacturing of the vector. Testing of the cell banks complies 
with requirements. Control of the plasmid is performed by the plasmid manufacturers.     
Three  manufacturing  processes  are  described  during  development:  Process  A,  Process  B-initial,  and 
Process  B-commercial.  Major  changes  are  made  between  Process  A  and  Process  B.  Comparability  of 
batches manufactured according to Process A and batches manufactured according to Process B has not 
been demonstrated. However, as the single Process A batch is > 4 years old and bridging of the test 
results is not possible this issue (D120 Major Objection) was not further pursued. As comparability of 
the Process A batch and Process B batches cannot be demonstrated, the assessment of the benefit risk 
of Zolgensma will be based on clinical data obtained with Process B batches. 
The main differences between Process B-initial and B-commercial include the container closure system, 
fill volume, and vector concentration and the presence of an Active Substance freeze-thaw step in Process 
B–commercial, which is not present in Process B–initial. For Active Substance, all Process B batches are 
claimed to be manufactured according to the commercial process.  
As the therapeutic window of Zolgensma appears to be narrow, accurate dosing is critical. It is therefore 
important that 1) consistency of the Process B batches with regard to e.g. vector titre and infectivity is 
demonstrated and 2) an impact of the change from Process B-initial to Process B-commercial is excluded. 
Preliminary data suggest that the additional Active Substance freeze-thaw step does not impact product 
quality. The applicant committed to perform additional studies to confirm this. In addition, the applicant 
committed to re-evaluate the finished product specifications when additional patient data are available, 
in order to determine whether the release specifications adequately ensure optimal clinical outcome. 
The characterisation study and its evaluation are limited. It remains to be demonstrated whether ratio 
of gradient centrifugation bands and ratio of capsid proteins is comparable among batches and how the 
ratio is affected by the production process. The applicant provided a commitment to perform additional 
studies. The strategy of pooling the bands is justified as pooling has been used in non-clinical as well as 
in  clinical  application,  resulting  in  the  current  safety  and  efficacy  profile.  However,  the  differences 
between  the  vector  particles  from  the  bands  is  not  fully  understood.  Thus,  the  safety  and/or  efficacy 
profile of the product may benefit from evaluating the relevance of using all bands  in manufacture of 
the product. 
The  Active  Substance  and  Finished  Product  specifications  can  be  accepted  with  the  commitment  to 
implement  a  qualified  genomic  integrity  assay.  As  discussed  above  FP  acceptance  criteria  will  be  re-
evaluated  when  additional  patient  data  are  available.  The  proposed  shelf-life  for  Zolgensma  FP  (12 
months at < -60°C) is accepted but should be re-evaluated when additional stability data are available. 
In-use  stability  data  have  been  provided  and  give  no  reason  for  concern  however,  studies  are  not 
completed yet. The applicant committed to provide post-thaw stability data at the end of Finished Product 
shelf life and data on potential aggregate formation to further support the claimed in-use storage period. 
The SmPC contains a statement that, once thawed, the product should not be re-frozen, and may be 
stored for 14 days at 2-8°C. 
2.2.3.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The CAT has identified the following measures necessary to address the identified quality 
developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product: 
The applicant should perform a further evaluation of the finished product specifications when primary 
and  key  secondary  endpoint  data  from  additional  patients  with  2  copies  of  SMN2  are  available  (i.e. 
completion of CL-302 and CL-304 cohort 1). Based on this evaluation, it should be determined whether 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 24/150 
 
  
 
 
tightening of the release specification limits is needed to improve consistency of the batches and ensure 
optimal clinical outcome.  
The evaluation should take into account 1) product stability and 2) the correlation between critical quality 
attributes and clinical outcome in terms of survival, ventilatory support, motor milestones and relevant 
motor function scores (Bayley) in (pre-)symptomatic subjects born with 2 SMN2 copies.  
The correlation evaluation should include a complete evaluation of the range of FP data against clinical 
data  (e.g.  comparing  the  higher  and  lower  ranges  of  critical  quality  attributes)  and  consider  whether 
batches at the end of shelf life perform as well as batches at the beginning of shelf life. The analysis will 
take into account known sources of variability in assays and measurement techniques. 
The estimated dose given to the patient (vg/kg as determined based on the estimated genomic titre of 
the product batch at the time of dosing taking into account stability data) should be included as additional 
quality attribute. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above.  
2.2.4.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CAT recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. 
Control of vector genome integrity: The applicant should develop and implement a release test 
and define scientifically justified acceptance criteria.  When results of the first 30 batches tested with 
the in-house method are available, the continued need for a release test for vector genome integrity 
may be re-evaluated. 
2. 
The applicant will submit a variation to expand the release testing panel in the EU in 2022, 
before the implementation of additional manufacturing capacity.  
3. 
The applicant commits that at least four lots of intermediate will be included into the CPV 
program. Analysis of the intermediate from the first CPV will be provided with the first renewal of the 
conditional marketing authorisation application.  
4. 
The applicant will develop a more sensitive and precise method for analysis of protein impurity 
by end of 2020 and will submit a variation in 2021. Additionally, the specifications of impurities will be 
assessed in conjunction with the development of this method and modified as appropriate.  
5. 
The applicant will perform LC-MS analysis in order to attempt to identify the impurities listed in 
the specification. A progress update will be provided by June 2020.  
6. 
The applicant will validate an aggregation assay and, once validated, submit a variation to add 
this method to the stability program for finished product in 2021.  
7. 
The applicant commits to further characterize the aggregation for multiple batches ensuring 
that end of shelf-life samples are included in the characterisation. Data will be provided with the first 
application for renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation application.  
8. 
The applicant commits to revalidate the sterility test method to demonstrate absence of 
interference for Ph. Eur. compliant sampling volumes by June 2020. 
9. 
The applicant commits to perform a study to further confirm the in vitro and in vivo correlation 
using additional 2 finished product lots at the optimal dose level identified in the first phase of the 
study. The data should be submitted once available. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 25/150 
 
  
 
 
10. 
The applicant commits to establish an independent assay control for the potency assay by 
August 2020 to monitor assay performance as well as reference standard stability.  
11. 
The applicant commits to evaluate the impact of freeze thaw on active substance potency in at 
least two other active substance batches. The selection of batches/samples should aim to cover the 
range of active substance strength. Evaluation of the impact on aggregation should be performed once 
a suitable method is available. At first conditional authorisation renewal. 
12. 
The applicant commits to perform additional studies to characterize gradient centrifugation 
bands and demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency and comparability of batches manufactured according to 
Process B-initial and Process B-commercial at first conditional authorisation renewal. 
13. 
The applicant commits to determine the amount of co-packaged cap, rep, host cell DNA and 
adenoviral sequences and provide the results with the first renewal of the conditional marketing 
authorisation.  
14. 
The applicant commits to investigate possible root causes of the observed downward trends 
during stability. In addition, potency data will be collected for selected samples from these studies to 
evaluate potency change during storage. If such decrease is confirmed, additional development will be 
performed to evaluate factors that can impact stability during frozen storage. Progress update at first 
conditional authorisation renewal. 
15. 
The applicant commits to re-evaluate the finished product shelf life when further stability data 
are available and to include 1) data on aggregates and 2) the results of the root cause investigation. 
Progress update at first conditional authorisation renewal. 
16. 
The applicant commits to provide end of shelf life post-thaw storage and performance stability 
data and data on aggregates with the first renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation at first 
conditional authorisation renewal. 
17. 
The applicant will perform shock and vibration studies and additional shipping validation 
studies for the load of vials prior to the first commercial shipments of Zolgensma in the EU.  
18. 
Any unexpected genomic integrity results (e.g. results indicating mutations in the expressions 
cassette of the therapeutic gene which may lead to non-functional protein or altered protein levels) 
should be reported immediately.  
The CHMP endorsed the CAT assessment regarding the recommendation(s) for future quality 
development as described above.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology   
Overall, the pharmacology studies in a knockout model in mice provide proof of principle for the clinical 
treatment rationale for IV injection of Zolgensma in the intended patient population (young patients with 
SMA type 1). IT injection of Zolgensma in an induced model of SMA1 in piglets provide additional proof 
for the concept.  IV injection with AVXS101 at early time points (PND 1 or 2) in mice or NHP and IT and 
ICV injection in juvenile piglets, show efficient systemic and CNS biodistribution of AVXS101 as well as 
efficient  transgene  expression.  In  addition,  pharmacology  studies  in  mice  and  cynomolgus  monkey 
suggest that early treatment is beneficial, which was also observed in rat and cat according to published 
data. The later treatment is started, the more motor neurons are damaged, which cannot be cured by 
this  therapy.  Furthermore,  the  later  treatment  is  started  in  mice,  the  more  glial  cells  and  the  lesser 
motor neurons are transduced, although transduction of motor neurons is key to treatment success. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 26/150 
 
  
 
 
Intrathecal (IT), intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intracranial injection shows efficient distribution of the 
vector to the motor neurons in the CNS of NHP using a 10-fold lower dose compared to IV injection.  ICV 
dosing  in  mice  largely  limited  biodistribution  to  the  CNS  whereas  upon  IT  injection  in  monkeys  also 
peripheral tissues were efficiently transduced, suggesting that the monkey is also exposed systemically 
upon IT dosing. However, the IT route is not the administration route intended in the proposed indication 
and thus, studies using this administration route were only considered as supportive studies. 
Knockout mouse model for SMA; smnΔ7 mice; IV and ICV dosing  
Distribution  of  AAV9  and  subsequent  transgene  expression  was  assessed  in  neonatal  and  adult  mice. 
Targeting  of  AAV9.CB.GFP,  a  AAV9  vector  similar  to  Zolgensma  but  containing  a  sequence  for  GFP 
protein, was studied in wild-type C57BL/6 mice that received an IV injection of AAV9.CB.GFP on PND1 
or 2, when the blood-brain barrier in mice is not fully developed. GFP expression at 10 and 21 days post 
injection  was  identified  in  heart  and  skeletal  muscle,  in  dorsal  root  ganglia  (DRG)  and  lower  motor 
neurons (LMN) in the spinal cord. Widespread GFP expression was found in the brain, which also persisted 
up to 21 days. In contrast, IV injection in adult mice (~70 days) did not result in GFP expression in DRG 
and markedly decreased LMN transduction. GFP expression in spinal cord of animals injected at adult 
age  was  identified  primarily  in  astrocytes.  In  the  brains,  GFP  expression  was  restricted  primarily  to 
dentate gyrus and hippocampus, suggesting a markedly different expression pattern in adults compared 
to neonates. GFP expression was maintained for up to 7 weeks post induction.  
In the pharmacology study conducted by Foust et al., 2010, timing of administration of AAV9-SMN1 was 
assessed  in  a  mouse  SMA  model  (smnΔ7  mouse).  Mice  received  AAV9-SMN1  at  PND  1,  2,  5  or  10. 
Survival and motor function of AAV9-SMN1 injected animals on PND2 appeared similar to injection on 
PND1. In addition, size and weight was improved compared to the placebo smnΔ7 group, but not reach 
the levels of control mice (SMN2+/+; SMNΔ7+/+; Smn+/-). Mice given AAV9-SMN1 on PND5 showed a shift 
from  neuronal  to  glial  transgene  expression,  suggesting  a  change  has  occurred  in  blood-brain  barrier 
development. Survival and motor function were modest, with no animals surviving beyond approximately 
30  days.  Injection  of  AAV9-SMN  on  PND10  resulted  in  no  rescue  of  phenotype  and  survival  was 
comparable to control GFP-injected smnΔ7 mice. This suggests that timing of administration is important 
to obtain an optimal clinical effect. In addition, treatment at PND10 may be too late as the accumulated 
neuronal damage in the first 10 days of life is sufficient to initiate early death. Rather, administration of 
3.3 x 1014 vg/kg AAV9-SMN on or before PND2 is able to drastically increase survival and motor function 
in a mouse model of SMA. In the written summary only, dose selection results are presented, but are 
not supported with publications or underlying data (see figure 2.1.2.1.b in NC AR). This work was not 
part of the publication of Foust et al. 2010. It appears that, based on this figure alone, at the highest 
dose tested (3.3 x 1014 vg/kg), mice survived for over 250 days and the dose immediately below that 
(6.7 x 1013 vg/kg) is no longer effective. The MTD in the pivotal toxicology studies is 1.5 x 1014 vg/kg, 
which  suggests  absence  of  a  therapeutic  window.  In  the  clinical  part  of  the  dossier  a  similar  figure 
(assessor’s comment figure 1) was shown as compared to the figure discussed here. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 27/150 
 
  
 
 
Figure 1 Survival of SMN animals treated with escalating doses of Zolgensma in the delta 7 
mouse model of SMA 
The  above  Figure  1  introduces  additional  efficacy  data  for  a  dose  of  2.0x1014  vg/kg.  The  Applicant 
anticipated  the  human  dose  of  2.0x1014  vg/kg  (when  using  the  validated  quantification  assay:  i.e. 
1.1x1014 vg/kg) as MABEL the therapeutic effect (i.e. survival) was indistinguishable from the 3.3x1014 
vg/kg dose. However, only survival was based on an analysis in only 2 mice for the dose of 2.0 x 1014 
vg/kg. It seems as was this latter data obtained in an in vivo potency assay and added together with the 
data obtained in the study conducted by Foust et al., 2010. Ultimately, the therapeutic window in mice 
is small and there is no clear rationale or justification for clinical dose selection, since underlying data 
are missing.  
The  applicant  noted  that  for  phase  1  clinical  trials,  clinical  dose  identification was  based  on  2  criteria 
identified in animal studies: doubling Delta 7 SMA mouse life span  (7.4e+13 vg/kg ) and restoring full 
life (1.2e+14 vg/kg ) in delta 7 SMA mice. The approach to establish that the Phase 3 clinical dose is 
equivalent to the Phase 1 clinical dose, was to first establish the stability of the Phase 1 Clinical Lot (only 
one Lot was used in the Phase 1 study) with the newly developed analytical methods. The same approach 
was used to establish the phase III clinical dose but using novel analytical methods.  
The underlying data are derived from the mouse potency assay. The summary table of the results of 
these studies reports the median survival of ΔSMA7 mice per lot and per individual mouse. From this it 
could be derived that the dose which is equivalent to the proposed therapeutic dose from the Zolgensma 
Phase 1 Clinical Study is 1.1e+14 vg/kg, as measured by the improved PCR  Assay. Safety data from 
pivotal  toxicology  studies  served  to  establish  the  MTD  based  on  mortality  associated  with  treatment-
related atrial thrombosis (The NOEL for atrial thrombosis and mortality was 1.5e+14 vg/kg, which was 
also the MTD) whereas doses of 3.9e+14 vg/kg showed substantial liver toxicity. The safety studies were 
conducted with Phase 3 Clinical Lot material produced by the proposed commercial Process B, which was 
appropriately qualified for Phase 3 Clinical use.  Therefore, retrospectively the Applicant considered that 
a dose of 1.1E14 represents a sufficiently large therapeutic window for safe and effective treatment. The 
applicant has provided a response which is more related to the fact that there is a remarkable clinical 
effect  and  that  the observed  liver  toxicity  is  also  clinically  manageable.  The  Applicant  is  nevertheless 
reminded that batch to batch consistency remains an important determinant of potency and therefore 
potential  safety.  The  Applicant  provided  some  data  to  support  starting  points  for  dosing  in  terms  of 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 28/150 
 
  
 
 
 
 
efficacy. However, the changes of production process, update of the assay to determine the actual vector 
dose  and  establishment  of  the  MTD  after  start  of  the  first  clinical  study  make  the  whole  clinical  dose 
determination  a  difficult  process  to  be  followed.    Since  the  current  clinical  dose  seems  effective  and 
safety issues can be handled to a sufficient extent, this issue will not be further pursued from non-clinical 
perspective.   
Systemic  administration  of  Zolgensma  has  been  conducted  at  PND1  and  several  endpoints  including 
expression of human SMN protein, body weight, survival and motor functions were analyzed. Thereby, 
it could be demonstrated that a single IV injection of Zolgensma at a dose of 3.3 x 1014 vg/kg increased 
the SMN protein levels in spinal cord (SC), brain and skeletal muscle of SMNΔ7 mice, although similar 
expression levels as observed in control animals were not reached. The applicant indicated that the large 
inter-animal  differences  observed  by  Western  blot  are  most  likely  due  to  normal  variation  within  the 
strain. If this is indeed the case, the expression data evaluating SMN levels in SMN Δ7 mice treated with 
Zolgensma should be interpreted with caution as some of the observed increased levels of SMN protein 
in Zolgensma treated mice could be attributed to the strain variation. In addition, the applicant confirmed 
that the control animals are heterozygous animals expressing only 50% SMN  protein as compared to 
wild type mice.     
The  relation  between  Zolgensma  dose  and  efficacy  upon  ICV  injection  was  investigated  in  the  mouse 
model for SMA. SMNΔ7 mice receiving the highest dose of Zolgensma via the ICV route at PND1 had a 
median survival of 282 days. The next two lower doses (2.6 x 1013 and 1.8 x 1013 vg/kg) had median 
survivals of 274 and 165 days, respectively. The lowest two doses exhibited median survivals of 24 and 
19 days, respectively, which did not significantly differ from untreated mice, which exhibited a median 
survival of 17.5 days. The lowest effective intrathecal dose appears to be 1.8 x 1013 vg/kg, whereas the 
clinically targeted intrathecal dose expected to provide maximal patient benefit appears 3.3 x 1013 vg/kg. 
Biodistribution was studied simultaneously with the AAV9.CBA.GFP construct, which appeared to have 
similar  biodistribution  as  Zolgensma.  With  the  highest  dose  of  the  AAV9.CBA.GFP  vector,  46,  47  and 
72% of cervical, thoracic and lumbar motor neurons were transduced respectively. 
Considering  the  fact  that  treatment  with  Zolgensma  is  a  one-time  treatment  aiming  at  maximal 
transduction  of  motor  neurons,  direct  administration  of  Zolgensma  into  the  CNS  could  yield  better 
transduction  efficiency  than  systemic  administration at  least  depending  on  the  age  at  treatment.  The 
two  administration  routes,  however,  have  not  been  compared  in  a  systematic  manner  in  appropriate 
non-clinical  studies.  A  systematic  non-clinical  approach  (e.g.  side-by-side  analysis  of  IV  vs  IT 
administration  of  Zolgensma  at  different  ages  in  a  relevant  species)  could  have  provide  valuable 
information on the preferred administration route depending on the age and the applicant was asked to 
justify lack of such studies and to provide a justification for the chosen administration route. 
The chosen route of administration has been justified by indicating that patients with more severe forms 
of SMA, including SMA type 1, are more likely to have systemic manifestations that would benefit from 
IV administration. Furthermore, IV administration is demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of 
infants with SMA in the clinic for infants treated with Zolgensma at an age of < 6 months.  
Induced model of SMA in piglets, intrathecal and intracisternal dosing  
Distribution of the scAAV9.CB.GFP vector and expression of its transgene was investigated in 2 groups 
of three 5-day old piglets that were dosed either intrathecal (at L5) or via intracisternal (at the base of 
the skull) injection with 5.2 x 1012 vg/kg of scAAV9.CB.GFP. All piglets were sacrificed between 21 and 
24 days post injection and tissues were collected for histology and immunohistochemistry evaluation. 
GFP expression was observed in the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord grey and white matter. Extensive 
motor neuron transduction as well as the large ventral horn neurons was observed. In the brains, highest 
expression levels were seen in cerebellar Purkinje cells, medulla nerve fibers as well as discrete nuclei, 
such as the olivary nucleus. Expression within the rest of the brain was restricted to scattered cells near 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 29/150 
 
  
 
 
the meningeal surfaces. Absence of significant GFP expression in peripheral tissues confirms selective 
CNS transduction following IT and intracisternal administration. 
A model for SMA in piglets was generated by transducing piglets on PND5 with an AAV9 vector carrying 
a  short  hairpin  sequence  to  downregulate  SMN1  mRNA  expression  (shSMN1).  This  resulted  in  a  70% 
reduction in SMN mRNA levels in motor neurons postnatally, which was sufficient to induce a SMA-like 
phenotype  in  the  neonatal  pigs  that  accurately  mimic  the  characteristic  electrophysiological  and 
histological  changes  associated  with  SMA  pathology 
in 
the  clinic.  Animals  were  either 
presymptomatically, on PND6 or symptomatically on PND33-36 transduced with Zolgensma (AAV9 vector 
carrying the SMN1 transgene). Immunostaining of pig spinal cord reveals a strong tropism of AAV9 for 
the motor neuron, with glial cells transduced only on rare occasions. Upon presymptomatic treatment 
on PND6 SMA disease phenotype was completely prevented (dose 8 x 1012 vg/kg). Upon symptomatic 
treatment  at  PND33-36,  partial  amelioration  of  the  disease  was  observed  (dose  2-3.8  x  1013  vg/kg. 
Although symptomatically treated piglets still respond and benefitted from treatment with Zolgensma, 
these experiments suggest that early delivery of the therapeutic vector is critical for optimal efficacy.  
Although Zolgensma has been administered via the IT route only in this SMA model, potential correlation 
between transduction efficiencies of motor neurons and amelioration of SMA pathology in this larger SMA 
animal  model  might  provide  helpful  additional  information  on  the  percentage  of  transduced  motor 
neurons required for a potential clinical benefit.  
The applicant additionally clarified that in the porcine SMA model only a single dose of Zolgensma has 
been tested, indicating that no dose-response relationship has been established in this model.    
Cynomolgus monkey; IV and ICV dosing 
Intra venous injection of scAAV9.CB.GFP in young cynomolgus monkeys led to transgene expression in 
skeletal muscle and organs including testes, heart, spleen and small intestine. Transgene expression in 
heart tissue was considerably less than in mice. In addition, injection at PND1, PND30 or PND90 led to 
passage of scAAV9.CB.GFP over the blood-brain barrier. If administered to NHPs at PND30 and PND90, 
the applicant indicated that still extensive transduction of motor neurons predicting clinical efficacy has 
been observed. However, no percentages of transduced motor neurons were provided. As PND30 and 
PND90 in NHP correspond to an age of 3 months and 1 year in human (Kim et al., 2017), these data are 
considered important, as treatment of paediatric SMA Type 1 patients could occur up to an age of 1.5 
years depending on the body weight of the patients.  
The applicant discussed the postnatal development of the human brain, thereby emphasizing that at an 
age of 36-months the human brain has reached approximately 80% of its volume and the number of 
neurons is expected to be equal to the number in adults. Thus, the applicant indicated that there may 
be no need for further linear vg/kg dosing at this age.  
In addition, the applicant suggests that the clinical benefit is more likely related to the progressive loss 
of motor neurons than a change in transduction efficiencies as a result of age. While it is true that the 
AAV  vector  can  only  transduce  neurons  that  are  still  viable,  it  has  also  been  demonstrated  that  with 
increasing  postnatal  age,  the  percentage  of  transduced  glial  cells  is  increasing,  while  the  number  of 
transduced neurons is decreasing depending on the CNS structure investigated. Age may influence the 
transduction efficiency upon i.v. administration in a healthy animal. Data on transduction efficiency (the 
percentages  of  transduced  neurons)  in  NHPs  treated  at  postnatal  day  30  and  90  was  not  present, 
consequently limiting the conclusions on the influence of age on transduction of neurons. However, both 
data in mice and cynomolgus monkeys agree with those published by two independent groups utilizing 
IV delivery of AAV9 to the CNS in rats and cats, provide further support for early treatment of infant 
patients with SMA.

Cynomolgus  monkeys  were  dosed  IT  with  1  x  1013  vg/kg  (correlating  with  2  x  1013  vg/monkey) 
AAV9.CB.GFP either or not in the Trendelenburg position. Maximal transduction efficiency was achieved 
when animals were held in the Trendelenburg position for 10 minutes post injection. GFP expression was 
55, 62 and 80% for cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions, respectively. In mice, a dose of 3.3 x 1013 
vg/kg yielded GFP expression of 46, 47 and 72% in cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions, respectively. 
This  suggest  that  with  a  lower  dose,  even  higher  transduction  efficiency  is  achieved  in  cynomolgus 
monkey as compared to mice. 
The  pharmacology  nonclinical  data  of  Zolgensma  included  in  the  dossier  have  been  conducted  with 
research  viral  preparations.  During  further  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  of  Zolgensma, 
manufacturing  Process  A  has  been  established  at  the  Nationwide  Children’s  Hospital  (NCH)  for 
manufacturing of the test material used in the Phase I clinical trial. Finally manufacturing Process B has 
been established at AveXis, which represents the current proposed and validated commercial process. 
Process  A  material  has  not  been  tested  in  non-clinical  studies.  Process  B  material  has  been  used  in 
combined non-clinical biodistribution and toxicology studies, but not in pharmacology studies included 
in the dossier.  
Importantly, the titration method used for determining the vector genome (vg) titer of Zolgensma has 
been  concomitantly  improved  during  manufacturing  process  development.  Re-titration  of  previously 
titrated lots, resulted in varying vg titers and a retrospective re-calculation of administered Zolgensma 
doses. This approach raises questions on the reliability of the previously used titrations methods and the 
indicated  administered  doses  in  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies.  The  applicant  indicated  that 
additional pharmacological data with Zolgensma lots representative of the planned commercial product 
and titrated with the ddPCR method have been performed and that a dose response for rescue of the 
SMNΔ7 has been established. The applicant has summarized the requested results of the in-vivo relative 
potency testing from 8 lots of Zolgensma representative of the planned commercial product.  
Initially  the  dose-response  in  the  dossier  indicated  that  6.7  x  1013  vg/kg  of  Zolgensma  (research 
preparations)  increased  the  survival  time  of  SMA  mice  from  15  to  35  days,  while  3.3  x  1014  vg/kg 
increased the survival to > 250 days. While it is not clear how the research preparations of Zolgensma 
were titrated, the Phase 1 material manufactured at the NCH has been titrated by two different methods 
The re-titration of this Phase I material revealed a titer of 1.1 x 1014 vg/kg instead of the 2.0 x 1014 
vg/kg titer previously measured by qPCR. Subsequently, the dose needed for doubling the survival time 
of SMA mice has been determined as 7.4 x 1013 vg/kg. Finally, Zolgensma potency was measured relative 
to the Phase I material (used as reference material) and both the Phase I reference material and several 
different  Phase  III  batches  (representative  of  the  planned  commercial  product)  revealed  comparable 
survival  times  depending  on  the  dose  administered:  Thereby,  a  dose  of  1.2  x  1013  vg/kg  Zolgensma 
resulted in an increase of the survival time of the SMA mice from ~ 2 week (14-17 days) to ~ 3 weeks 
(20-25 days), while 7.4 x 1013 vg/kg Zolgensma increased the survival time to ~ 4 weeks (28-34 days). 
Based  on  these  data  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  potency  of  the  Phase  III  material  has  been 
demonstrated and that the potency of this material is comparable to the Phase I material.   
Secondary pharmacology 
Efficacy of the product to reverse disease-related cardiac deficits was studied in neonatal SMNΔ7 mice. 
In the SMA mice model (SMNΔ7 mice) a decreased mass of the left ventricle and decreased wall thickness 
putatively due to eccentric hypertrophy is observed. Resultants are decreased heart rate and decreased 
heart  function  compared  to  wild-type.  Treatment  of  these  mice  with  Zolgensma  at  PND1  partially 
improved these symptoms as IV treatment with 5 x 1011 vector particles (3.3 x 1014 vp/kg) of Zolgensma 
on PND1 improved left ventricle (LV) remodelling and fully corrected heart rate. The applicant notes that 
both extent of dilation as well as wall thinning were attenuated and returned toward WT values in treated 
SMNΔ7  mice.  It  is  not  clear  whether  the  treatment  prevents  occurrence  of  the  heart  related  effects, 
which seems more plausible, or whether the effects are restored.

SMN is as a molecular scaffold onto which U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs) are assembled 
in the cytoplasm then shuttled into the nucleus.  UsnRNPs are crucial for the proper splicing of pre-mRNA 
to  mRNA.    Reduction  in  SMN  leads  to  a  deficiency  in  UsnRNP  assembly  and  complete  SMN  loss  is 
embryonic  lethal  in  mice  exemplifying  the  crucial  role  of  SMN  and  mRNA  splicing  across  tissues. 
Reduction of SMN leads to the specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons, which could potentially be 
explained by SMN’s RNA binding properties as a potential vehicle to transport mRNA down the length of 
axons for distal translation, a role also suggested from research in In vitro models with SMN deficient 
neurons, indicating compartment specific reductions in mRNA translation.  
Instances of naturally occurring SMN overexpression were recently reported as human cell lines derived 
from non-SMA individuals were shown with 3 copies of SMN1, which was not associated with defects. 
However, due to the treatment with Zolgensma, the number of copies of SMN1 may reach on average 
100  –  200  fold  the  normal  levels  thereby  not  excluding  much  higher  transgene  levels  in  single  cells. 
Risks associated with these expression levels are not discussed by the applicant. In the absence to life 
threatening  toxicity  clearly  related  to  or  associated  with  SMN1  expression  levels,  the  issue  of  safety 
issues related to high transgene expression levels will not be further pursued. The applicant should keep 
bearing  in  mind  that  high  transgene  expression  levels  or  increase  in  transcription  and  translational 
capacity might be responsible for liver toxicity observed in the clinic as in this organ most SMN1 copies 
per diploid genome were found.  
Thus,  SMN  protein  deficiency  leads  to  early  and  persistent  cardiac  dysfunction  in  mice,  which  can  be 
partially to fully corrected by systemic AAV9 SMN delivery. It is not understood whether this is due to 
the  transduction  of  the  heart  muscle  cells  directly  or  whether  it  is  a  resultant  of  the  transduction  of 
neurons that stimulate heart contraction. Whether it is a secondary or a primary pharmacodynamic effect 
could be a point of discussion.   
It can be agreed that no separate safety pharmacology studies or studies addressing pharmacodynamic 
drug interaction studies with Zolgensma need to be conducted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Zolgensma is an engineered viral vector, containing the sequence for the therapeutic protein that has to 
be  delivered  to  target  cells  via  an  Adeno  Associated  Virus  Serotype  9.  This  viral  capsid  is  a  natural 
occurring  viral  capsid.  This  introduced  therapeutic  vector  will  theoretically  not  integrate  into  the  host 
DNA, but stay episomal in the cell. In addition to this therapeutic transgene, the vector also contains 
other  sequences  to  support  sufficient  transcription.  Sequences  to  enable  recombination  of  the  vector 
with  a  wild-type  AAV9,  to  support  the  development  of  a  recombination  competent  virus  from  the 
therapeutic vector, are excluded from the vector or limited as much as possible. No dedicated absorption 
studies  are  conducted,  which  can  be  accepted  as  the  product  is  intravenously  injected  and  100% 
bioavailability could be expected. Upon intravenous administration the virus can be readily distributed 
systemically. The transduction efficacy of the various type of tissues is dependent on the tropism of the 
type of viral particle.  
(Bio)Distribution 
Biodistribution  and  persistence  of  Zolgensma  vector  DNA  as  well  as  RNA  expression  of  the  hSMN 
transgene have  been  assessed  in the  context  of  a  preliminary  6-months  IV  safety  and  biodistribution 
study in neonatal FVB mice (Study # AD49TV.7A32.BTL) using a research viral preparation characterized 
with  non-validated  analytical  methods.  Doses  has  been  indicated  as  6.7  x  1013  and  3.3  x  1014  vg/kg 
Zolgensma and tissues were collected for qPCR distribution and RNA expression analyses at 3, 6, 12, 
and 24 weeks post-dose.  
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 32/150 
 
  
 
 
This  preliminary  biodistribution  study  was  subsequently  followed  by  two  3-months  IV  safety  and 
biodistribution  studies  in  neonatal  FVB  mice  using  Zolgensma  manufactured  by  Process  B  and 
characterized by validated analytical methods. Zolgensma has been administered at a dose of 2.37  x 
1014 vg/kg (Study # 20122446), or at doses of 1.5 x 1014 vg/kg, 2.4 x 1014 vg/kg, and 3.0 x 1014 vg/kg 
(Study 8384031) and tissues were collected for ddPCR and RNA expression analyses at 3, 6/7, and 12 
weeks post-dose.  
Biodistribution  of  Zolgensma,  as  analysed  in  both the  12  week  and the  24  week  murine  GLP  studies, 
showed a persistent and widespread and high tissue transduction upon IV administration. Also, a tissue-
wide  and  high  transgene  expression  (including  the  heart,  liver  and  CNS)  was  observed,  with  vector 
distribution to transgene expression ratio in peripheral tissues ranging from approximately 1:1 to 1:10. 
This was also expected because of the use of a strong ubiquitous promoter used for driving transgene 
expression. Persistent vector and transgene levels in brains and spinal cord indicate successful crossing 
of  the  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB)  by  the  vector  after  systemic  administered  to  neonatal  mice.    Lower 
tissue  vector  distribution  and  transgene  expression  was  found  in  a.o.  spleen  and  gonads.  This 
biodistribution  pattern  was  comparable  between  the  different  doses  tested.  However,  there  was 
potentially lower transgene expression at week 12 for the lowest dose tested (1.5x1014 vg/kg), indicating 
that  -despite  persistent  vector  transduction-  expression  of  the  transgene  may  wane  over  time.  Thus, 
highest  levels  of  vector  DNA  and  hSMN  RNA  expression  has  consistently  been  observed  in  the  heart 
followed by skeletal muscle, SC, brain, liver and lung, whereas relatively low levels of vector DNA and 
hSMN RNA expression have been observed in spleen, testes and ovary.  
Generally,  it  would  be  expected  that  a  complete  list  of  organs  and  tissues  is  analysed  for  the 
biodistribution of the viral vector. The provided justification of the applicant indicates that the analyses 
of the organs and tissues has been restricted to the organs either involved in the pathology of the disease 
or expected to be highly transduced based on the vector tropism. As the tropism of the viral vector is 
not exclusive for the indicated organs, a less restricted biodistribution analysis would be preferred. Since 
a complete list of organs/tissues has not been investigated, it has to be assumed that the viral vector is 
also  reaching  other  organs  and  tissues  that  have  not  been  included  in  the  analysis,  and  that  the 
transgene  may  also  be  expressed  in  these  organs/tissues.  This  assumption  is  supported  by  the  two 
clinical  autopsy  reports  from  2  deaths  (occurring  52  days  and  5  months  after  vector  administration, 
respectively).  The  autopsy  reports  also  listed  the  distribution  of  the  viral  vector  and  the  transgene 
expression in the following organs/tissues: brain (different regions in one of the two deaths), spinal cord 
(different levels), dorsal and ventral roots, DRG, diaphragm, skeletal muscles, thymus, small and large 
intestine,  stomach,  lung, pancreas,  kidney,  heart,  spleen,  liver,  and lymph  node.  In  almost  all  of  the 
investigated organs and tissues including kidney the vector DNA could be detected and expression of the 
transgene was detectable (mRNA or protein).  
Based on the available biodistribution data from two treated infants that died during the phase III studies 
the kidney seemingly is an target organ for the viral vector. Therefore, biodistribution data of viral vector 
to the kidney in the mouse would have been interesting, but no new animal studies are requested.   
The persistent presence at week 12 of high vector DNA and transgene mRNA levels in various tissues 
(primarily heart and liver) in mice may indicate that the adverse events found in the 12 week GLP 
studies are probably related to the presence of (lots of) vector DNA and/or ubiquitous (over)expression 
of the transgene, which is discussed in the toxicology section. In NHP, a similar wide-spread vector 
distribution and transgene expression was observed, both after IV or IT administration, although the 
level differed for some organs compared to mice (e.g. NHP = lower heart transduction). Therefore, the 
toxic effects observed in mice with Zolgensma ca could potentially be clinically relevant.  
The  Applicant  has  expressed  their  biodistribution  study  results  as  vector  copies  per  μg  gDNA,  which 
provides an indication of the amount of transduction of the whole tissue. Additionally, vector transduction 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 33/150 
 
  
 
 
could be expressed as copies per diploid genome. This would provide more insight in the transducability 
of  tissues  at  a  single  cell  level  (enabling  comparison  between  different  studies)  and  would  allow  for 
estimation of the risk on cellular stress response after transduction with large numbers of vector genomes 
and/or  transgene  overexpression.  These  data  could  also  have  provided  useful  information  to  explain 
(part of the) toxicity, e.g. in the heart. Upon request the data were not provided, but instead human 
Zolgensma distribution data expressed as vector copies per diploid genome from one patient who died 
(study CL-303) were provided. Also, reference was made to distribution data from another patient (study 
CL-302) who died, was presented in the clinical part of the dossier, which was more limited with regard 
to number of tissues analysed. Whether these profiles are a general reflection of all patients is unknown. 
In  addition,  biodistribution  at  single  cell  level  could  be  different  in  mice  compared  to  humans.  For 
example because: 
• 
• 
fatal atrial thrombosis occurred in mice, but -according to the Applicant- no cardiovascular safety 
issues were present in human patients which may indicate a difference in transducability at individual 
cardiomyocyte level between mice and human; 
transduction of murine spleen was consistently lower in the different toxicity studies compared to 
the other tissues analysed, while the vector copies number in humans is considerably high (average 
= 10 copies per cell); this could also have resulted in a higher vector copy in the whole tissue (here: 
spleen) compared to mice. 
The Applicant provided an overview of all available human whole tissue and single cell biodistribution 
data  in  comparison  to  whole  tissue  murine  biodistribution  data  (from  the  GLP  12-week  studies)  to 
determine similarities and differences in transducability per tissue between mouse and human.  
The Applicant has not determined shedding of the vector, for example in serum, saliva, tears and 
sweat, while this is regarded integral part of biodistribution studies. Nevertheless, in the clinical part of 
the dossier, human shedding data of AAV9 (based on literature studies) is provided, which is 
considered sufficient.  
In addition, testes in NHP were positive for vector DNA and transgene RNA, although the cell type 
transduced (and thus potential risk of germ line transmission) was not determined. No data regarding 
female ovaries were available. In mice, an unexplained higher SMN expression was found at the 
highest dose (3x1014 vg/kg) in female ovaries at week 12 compared to week 3 and 6 (study no. 
8384031).  
Four different methods used for determination of vector DNA into the tissues and determination 
potential formation of antibodies are described. Three of them are also used in the clinic and one is 
only used for animal studies. The methods seems fit for purpose.  
It can be anticipated that the AAV9 capsid after entrance of the cell will be broken down via normal 
cellular routes. The building blocks for DNA and the therapeutic protein could also be regarded as 
natural to human. Thus, absence of metabolism or excretion studies or studies addressing 
pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies can be agreed because of the biological nature of the product. 
The  applicant  indicated  that  no  tissues  were  to  be  judged  as  negative.  Indeed,  Biodistribution  data 
included in the report of Study AD49TV.7A32.BTL revealed mostly positive results for vector DNA for the 
investigated organs and time points of animals administered Zolgensma. The only exceptions were the 
gonad samples from Week 24, which turned out to be either negative or containing vector DNA levels 
ranging between 49 and 128 copies/µg gDNA. These data reveal the following: 1) negative signals were 
only detected at the latest time point investigated, and 2) only samples revealing ≤ 50 vector copies/µg 
gDNA were declared as negative.

2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The Applicant has provided a pilot study and three GLP studies in which the safety and biodistribution of 
IV-administered Zolgensma was tested in neonatal wild-type mice. Furthermore, a pilot IV study in NHP 
which were dosed at PND90, was provided. All studies were performed with pre-process A batch material, 
except for the two 12-week GLP studies (process B). Additionally, two studies in mice and one study in 
NHP  were  provided,  which  determined  safety  and  biodistribution  of Zolgensma  after  ICV/IT  injection. 
However,  these  were  all  non-GLP  studies  conducted  with  a  research  grade  batch  (pre-process  A)  for 
which vector quality and titre were analysed with non-validated methods.  
In all murine toxicology studies, the Applicant has used wild-type FVB/n mice. These albino mice appear 
to  become  blind  at  weaning  age,  but  also  seem  to  have  decreased  Integrin  α2  expression  leading  to 
decreased  platelet  adhesion  to  collagen,  which  in  turn  results  in  decreased  thrombus  formation.  This 
strain is not often used for toxicology studies. It is thus not known whether there is sufficient historical 
control  data,  which  hinders  distinguishing  the  product-related  findings  from  the  strain  background-
related findings. It is noted that this strain was also used as background strain for the SMA mouse model 
(SMNΔ7 mouse).  
The Applicant has chosen to use the FVB/n strain in the toxicology studies to be able to directly compare 
safety data from the SMNΔ7 studies. However, these studies were performed with research batches (pre-
process  A),  while  the  GLP  studies  were  conducted  with  process  B  batches.  Because  manufacturing 
process B is most likely considerably different from pre-process A and because different doses (i.e. at 
least determined with a different assay) have been used in the pharmacology and toxicology studies, a 
direct comparison between data from both study types would not have been perfect either. As the FVB/n 
background was needed to create the SMNΔ7 model and no historical background data would be available 
for this strain when injected with Zolgensma at PND0/1 in the temporal vein, the rationale for choosing 
the same strain for toxicology studies is considered sufficient. Although the targets of toxicity are clear, 
the level of toxicity (leading to calculation of the NOAEL/MTD) might have been underestimated using 
this specific strain. As the Applicant considers monitoring liver, heart and coagulation important in the 
clinical  trials,  these  potential  underestimated  safety issues  might  be  detected early  enough  to  enable 
intervention, upon occurrence.  
The homology between NHP and human is higher than between mice and human. Nevertheless, the NHP 
raised an antibody titre against both the vector and the transgene, while the mice raised an antibody 
titre against the vector alone. The Applicant considers the age of the animals species at treatment most 
important to explain this difference.  
Mice IV administered with Zolgensma (Pivotal studies) 
The  Applicant  conducted  two  12  weeks  and  one  24  weeks  GLP  compliant  studies  with  a  single  IV 
Zolgensma administration in neonatal FVB wild type mice as indicated in the table below. 
EMA/200482/2020

Table 2 Mice studies administered with Zolgensma IV 
As  indicated  in  the  table  above,  Study  AD49TV.7A32.BTL  was  the  only  GLP  safety study  that  did  not 
reveal major toxicity findings at doses up to 3.3 x 1014 vg/kg Zolgensma. However, this study has been 
conducted  with  research  viral  preparation  using  a  manufacturing  process  that  preceded  the 
establishment of Process A and appeared not to be a pivotal, GLP compliant study. For the test material 
used  in  Study  AD49TV.7A32.BTL,  HEK293  cells  were  transfected  in  roller  bottles.  After  lysis,  the 
preparation  was  subjected  to  two  rounds  of  CsCL  ultracentrifugation,  with  the  collected  band  of  full 
capsids dialyzed into formulation buffer containing poloxamer 188.  
The subsequent GLP single dose toxicity studies, Study 20122446 and Study 8384031, using GMP test 
material  from  the  initial  Process  B  manufacturing  process  revealed  dose-dependent,  delayed 
cardiovascular toxicity that was associated with thrombus formation in the atrium of the heart resulting 
in unscheduled mortality in a significant number of animals.  
The first 12 week study performed with a GMP-compliant batch from process B (study no. 20122446) 
resulted in a systemic inflammatory response at week 3 in all dose groups (i.e. 7.9x1013, 2.37x1014 and 
3.91x1014 vg/kg), followed by signs of blood loss or stress in the two highest dose groups at later time 
points. Additional clinical abnormalities (e.g. hypoactivity, breathing difficulties, abdominal distension, 
closed or dark eyes) and unscheduled mortality (100% before week 12) were only present in the highest 
dose group. The cause of death in 13 of these mice was due to atrial thrombi, but for the other 16 mice 
no cause of death was determined, although heart and liver lesions were found. This requires further 
discussion  (see  below).  Comparable  lesions  were  found  in  mice  that  survived  until  scheduled  death,

although 
Degeneration/regeneration in heart was considered minimal in severity at a dose of 7.9 x 1013 vg/kg, 
and  minimal  to  mild  in  severity  at  doses  of  2.37  x  1014  vg/kg  and  3.91  x  1014  vg/kg,  respectively. 
Similarly, minimal signs of regeneration were observed in liver of females administered 2.37 x 1014 vg/kg 
AXVS-101 and in the liver of both males and females administered 3.91 x 1014 vg/kg Zolgensma. The 
NOAEL in this study was 2.37 x 1014 vg/kg. 
resolving 
(partly) 
over 
and 
The second 12-week study performed with a GMP-compliant batch from process B (study no. 8384031) 
showed adverse events and unscheduled mortality in all dose groups tested (i.e. 1.5x1014, 2.4x1014 and 
3.0x1014 vg/kg). The Applicant was asked for a clear (tabulated) summary of the mortality rates in the 
different groups, including their cause-of-death and/or main pathological observations (see remarks on 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 36/150 
 
  
 
 
 
 
studies below). Part of the mortality cases (i.e. 11 out the 19) were product-related, based on clinical 
observations  (a.o.  hypoactivity,  breathing  difficulties,  protruding/dark  eyes),  changes  in  blood 
parameters (indicating stress, inflammation and/or dehydration) and pathological abnormalities (dose-
dependent lesions in ventricles, atria, liver, lung and spleen/thymus). Death was associated with atrial 
thrombosis,  sometimes  accompanied  by  atrial  dilation,  fibroplasia,  myocardial  degeneration/necrosis, 
and/or mononuclear inflammation. Atrial thrombosis and atrial wall changes were dose-dependent and 
present in mid and high dose animals (≥ 2.4 x 1014 vg/kg). Although the Applicant states that 8 of the 
19 premature deaths were likely not related to Zolgensma, it may be related to injection at PND0 instead 
of PND1 used in the other studies. All dose groups showed reduced food consumption and body weight 
(gain). Although potential trends towards differences in blood parameters might be present, lack of data 
from  sufficient  animals  prevented  further  assessment  of  these  values.  Histopathologically,  product-
related lesions in a.o. the liver (hepatocellular hypertrophy) and ventricular wall of the heart (oedema, 
inflammation,  fibrosis)  were  found  in  all  dose  groups,  while  atrial  wall  changes  (fibroplasia, 
degeneration/necrosis,  dilation)  and  thrombi,  inflammation  in  the  lung  and  more  severe  liver  lesions 
(e.g. necrosis and vacuolation) were only found in the intermediate and high dose groups. Based on the 
lack of similar cardiovascular toxicities resulting in Zolgensma-related mortality, the low dose of 1.5 x 
1014  vg/kg  was  defined  as  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD).  The  no  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL) 
could  not  be  defined  in  this  study,  based  on  the  liver  and  heart  lesions  that  included  minimal 
hepatocellular  hypertrophy,  minimal  ventricular  myocardial  oedema,  minimal  myocardial  fibrosis,  and 
minimal  mononuclear  cell inflammation  that  were observed  also in the low  dose  group.  These effects 
were of low severity and not life-threatening and are probably directly associated with the administration 
of AAV vectors and subsequently induced inflammatory responses. 
The  underlying  mechanisms  of  atrial  thrombosis  and  mortality  observed  in  neonatal  mice  after  IV 
administration of Zolgensma are not known at the time and the applicant did not indicate whether and 
how  these  non-clinical  findings  will  be  further  investigated.  It  is  acknowledged  that  available  clinical 
cardiovascular  safety  data  have  not  provided  evidence  for  severe  cardiovascular  safety  problem  in 
human. However, the safety of Process B material has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated.  
The applicant only considers the two 12-weeks study as relevant for the toxicity observed in the heart 
and made a distinction between ventricle and atrium related findings. Adverse findings related to the 
ventricles  (no  NOAEL)  comprised  of  mainly  inflammation,  followed  by  oedema  and  fibrosis,  likely 
attributable to the prominent biodistribution (and related immunogenic response) of Zolgensma to the 
heart, but were only minimal to slight in severity and would not be considered to be life threatening. 
Strikingly, no thrombosis was seen upon ventricle inflammation in contrast to atrium inflammation. This 
is not notified by the applicant.  
Findings related to the atrium were dose-related and present at doses of ≥2.4E14 vg/kg and the NOEL 
for atrial thrombosis was  1.5E14 vg/kg and often cause of death or reason for unscheduled sacrifice. 
According  to  the  applicant  the  most  likely  pathogenesis  of  atrial  thrombosis  is  considered  to  be 
inflammatory  or  degenerative  injury  to  the  endothelial/subendothelial  surface  of  the  atria  exposing  a 
thrombogenic surface and precipitating atrial thrombosis. However, this hypothesis is only theoretical in 
nature and not supported by any non-clinical data.  
According to the applicant, no alteration in blood coagulability was present and could thus not contribute 
to atrial thrombosis. However, in 12-week study no. 8384031, a trend towards increased coagulation 
times (at PND 84) and decreased platelets (at PND 21-84, depending on the sex) could be observed in 
the highest dose groups, although not all parameters were significant due to limited animal numbers. In 
addition, in 12-week study no. 20122446, the Applicant stated that a decrease in platelets was observed 
in  pre-terminal  animals  and  that  this  decrease  “may  have  been  related  to  Zolgensma  and  associated 
with thrombus formation in the heart” (page 898 of the report). An AAV-related systemic inflammatory 
reaction  could  have  resulted  in  platelet  activation  with  subsequent  intravascular  coagulation  at 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 37/150 
 
  
 
 
thrombogenic  surfaces  and  thrombocytopenia  (e.g.  Hinderer  et  al.  2018).  Alternatively,  AAV-induced 
complement  activation  and  subsequent  opsonisation  of  platelets  could  have  resulted  in  altered 
coagulability.  
The applicant did not regard the expression level of SMN in the mouse upon Zolgensma treatment to be 
causative  for  the  atrial  thrombosis.  The  applicant  did  not  consider  the  overstretching  of  cellular 
functioning (transcription and translation machinery) due to the high viral transduction as a potential 
cause of thrombosis.  
The applicant notes that translatability of this finding to humans is not known, but that upon identification 
of the heart as toxicity target organ, adequate cardiovascular safety monitoring measures were put in 
place in the clinical studies. This approach is supported. In relation to the translatability of the findings, 
the  applicant  presented  data  from  a  fatal  case  in  clinical  study  302,  showing  widespread  viral 
transduction to CNS as well as to liver and heart, without inflammation or other notable findings in the 
heart or liver. However, the applicant did not fully exclude translatability of the finding as the applicant 
notes that if translatability would occur, it would likely be transient, consistent with the transient nature 
of liver and myocardial enzyme elevations seen in clinical studies.   
The relationship of the occurrence of cardiovascular toxicity with the mouse strain used and the age of 
the  animals  at  start  of  dosing  are  not  clear.  Insight  in  mechanisms  underlying  atrial  thrombosis  are 
limited.    The  occurrence  of  cardiovascular  toxicity  in  the  clinic  should  be  addressed  in  the  clinic  as 
extrapolation from non-clinical data is not possible.    
In addition to both 12-week studies, the 24-week study (study no. AD49TV.7A32.BTL) did -according to 
the Applicant- not result in product-related adverse events, including unscheduled mortality. However, 
statistically significant (dose-related) reduced body weight, changes in erythrocyte-related parameters 
(decreased  erythrocyte  count,  Hb  and  HCT,  increased  MCV  and  MCH),  changes  in  different  leukocyte 
counts (decreased lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils, increased monocytes and neutrophils) and 
decreased serum proteins were observed for both sexes in the vector-treated groups compared to the 
control group. Although these effects were temporary, they all occurred primarily in the first weeks post-
injection and a relation with vector treatment cannot be excluded.   
It was noted that this study was performed with a research batch (pre-process A), while the 12-week 
studies were performed with a clinical grade batch (process B). In addition, for dose quantification in the 
24 week study no validated PCR method was used. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn based on 
this study and thus no long-term study data (> 12 weeks) are available for assessment. 
The difference in toxicity outcome for the three GLP studies is significant, varying from no adverse events 
(according to the Applicant, 24 week study no. AD49TV.7A32.BTL) to adverse events at the lowest dose 
used  (12  week  study  no.  8384031)  or  100%  premature  mortality  before  final  sacrifice  in  the  highest 
dose  group  (12  week  study  no.  20122446).  Although  three  different  batches  have  been  used  (and 
potentially  also  different  doses),  their  purity  and  sterility  does  not  seem  to  differ  and  both  12-week 
studies have been performed with GMP-compliant batches (using process B).  
Apparently,  results  from  the  24-week  study  can  not  be  compared  with  the  12-week  murine  studies, 
because  the  exact  dose  could  not  be  established,  and  the  study  was  conducted  with  a  pre-process  A 
batch. Actual toxicity data that could be relevant for the clinic should therefore come from the GLP 12-
week studies. Indeed, main toxicity targets are liver and heart. But the severity of the clinical signs and 
toxicity-related mortality is different between both 12-week studies. 
The  Applicant  has  provided  information  regarding  the  (different)  pathology  terminology  used  in  the 
pivotal 12-week studies. However, since a pathologist is expected to be able to differentiate between 
degeneration and subsequent regenerative signs (present in study 20122446, but not in study 8384031), 
the  difference  in  study  outcome  with  respect  to  lesion  reversibility  is  not  considered  a  matter  of 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 38/150 
 
  
 
 
terminology. In addition, mortality is not regarded related to terminology. For example, a considerable 
difference in the outcome of the studies with comparable dosing is that all animals in the highest dose 
group of study 20122446 (i.e. 3.91x1014 vg/kg) did not survive until week 12, while most of the animals 
in the highest dose group of study 8384031 (i.e. 3.0x1014 vg/kg) did survive until week 12. In contrast, 
no  obvious  clinical  signs  or  mortality  were  present  in  the  mid-dosed  group  of  study  20122446  (i.e. 
2.37x1014  vg/kg),  while  adverse  clinical  events  (e.g.  reduced  body  weight)  and  mortality  in  study 
8384031 already occurred in the low-dosed group (i.e. 1.5x1014 vg/kg) and thrombus-related mortality 
was present in the mid-dosed group (i.e. 2.4x1014 vg/kg). Taken together, distinct outcomes are present 
in both studies. The Applicant discussed that the unscheduled deaths that did not have significant atrial 
lesions and/or thrombi (e.g. 16 mice in the highest dose group of study no. 20122446) that were not 
atrial  thrombus-related.  The  other  heart  and  liver  lesions  were  not  considered  different  between 
unscheduled  and  scheduled  deaths  and  would  therefore  not  be  related  to  the  cause  of  death.  The 
Applicant states that the FVB/n strain may be very susceptible to mortality, although this was not further 
substantiated  with  other  (publicly  available)  data.  This  could  be  an  explanation  for  the  considerable 
numbers of unscheduled deaths, in combination with the very young age of the animals at treatment. 
Differences in frequency and severity of adverse events (i.e. in study no. 8384031) between the two 
sexes could be caused by increased susceptibility of males to Zolgensma-related toxicity. Although not 
mentioned by the Applicant, stress due to housing with non-littermates (aggression males > females) 
may also play a role, but this is not treatment-related. It was noted that animals in study 8384031 were 
weaned at day 21, while the animals in study 20122446 were weaned 1 week later. In addition, animals 
were housed individually (study 8384031) or with maximum 3 animals of the same dose group (study 
20122446). This difference in weaning and housing strategy may also have influences the stress level 
(and thus susceptibility to adverse events) of the animals in both studies. 
Haematological  and  clinical  chemistry  analyses  were  started  only  3  weeks  after  the  first  dose,  while 
adverse events in humans, e.g. thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases, occur in the first weeks 
post-injection.  Apparently,  an  earlier  time  point  for  drawing  blood  from  the  mice  was  not  technically 
feasible. Early clinical findings could therefore not be related to findings in the NC toxicology studies. 
The applicant states that the pathogenesis of the toxic events could be related to the vector and/or the 
transgene.  However,  neonatal  administration of  Zolgensma  most  likely  induced  immune  tolerance  for 
the transgene (NB: absence of antibody responses to the transgene were only evaluated with pre-process 
A  batches).  Moreover,  the  Applicant  concludes  that  transgene  overexpression  should  not  result  in 
adverse  events,  because  it  is  a  physiological  status  in  some  people  to  have  several  copies  of  SMN1 
(although Zolgensma may result in many more vector copies and thus also transgene copies in specific 
tissues). It is therefore still unclear whether the adverse events are the consequence of vector-related, 
transgene-related and/or species-specific effects. Because there are also effects on the liver and heart 
in  human  patients  treated  with  Zolgensma,  at  least  the  (immune  response  against  the)  vector,  high 
transgene copies (i.e. cell stress-related cell death) or foreign transgene copies in specific tissues are 
expected  to  play  a  mechanistic  role  in  the  adverse  events.  Difference  in  severity  of  the  toxic  events 
between mice and humans may be related to differences in transducability of certain tissues and/or the 
use of corticosteroids.  
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  Zolgensma  related  effects  in  animals,  with  special  attention  to 
occurrence  of tissue  lesions  (primarily  liver  and  ventricle)  already  found  in  doses  0.7-  to 1.4-fold  the 
clinical  dose  and  the  striking  mortality  in  mice  at  doses  2-3  the  clinical  dose  required  discussion. 
Apparently, most important Zolgensma related toxic events in mice occurred in the liver and heart (both 
ventricle and atrium). The Applicant has mentioned that liver tissue is highly transduced in both mice 
and  human  and  that  liver  lesions  also  occur  in  the  clinic  (i.e.  increase  in  transaminases),  although 
transiently (most likely because of the use of corticosteroids). The Applicant considers the toxic events 
in the mice as being vector-related. Because this is a platform effect and the heart is also significantly 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 39/150 
 
  
 
 
transduced in humans (at least at single cell level, see Question 162), the change on toxic heart issues 
in the clinic should not be underestimated. An appropriate monitoring system for the functionality of vital 
organs and a functional intervention protocol when (life-threatening) toxic events would occur should be 
in place. This is further assessed in the clinical sections. 
Upon request, the applicant provided a discussion on whether the very young age of the treated mice 
could be associated with the induction of the observed atrial thrombosis. Although it cannot be ruled out 
that it could have an influence, the applicant emphasized that atrial thrombosis peaked between 3 and 
7 weeks post-dose, a time-point when coagulation and haemostasis is functionally matured and the mice 
reached  an  age  equivalent  to  a  child  or  adolescent  in  human.  Thus,  in  the  applicant’s  view  the  time 
course of the observed atrial thrombosis rather suggests that the immune response to foreign AAV capsid 
and/or  expressed  transgene  product  antigens  and  the  lymphocytic  myocardial  infiltrates  result  in 
inflammatory  or  degenerative  injury  to  the  endothelial/subendothelial  surface  of  the  atria  and 
subsequently to atrial thrombosis. Such a scenario would not be age-dependent. The applicant further 
sufficiently justifies the very young age of the mice chosen for Zolgensma administration, which is a.o. 
due to vector distribution and BBB development. However, for investigating whether there is a correlation 
between the very young age of the mice at treatment and the occurrence of atrial thrombosis, the vector 
administered IV may be inducing the observed cardiovascular toxicities. Thus, such studies could have 
been conducted in mice. Thus, the provided justification for not investigating this aspect non-clinically 
falls short. However, as the answer of the applicant reveals that there are at least 6 SMA patients that 
were treated at an age of 8 – 14 days and since the available clinical safety data as of 22 March 2019 
show no cardiovascular adverse events that have been judged to be related to Zolgensma, this issue is 
no longer pursued. 
Part of clinical chemistry data (or measurement in only one or two animals), coagulation assessment in 
the intermediate (females) and high (males) dose groups in study no. 8384031 was lacking. The 
provided justifications are considered acceptable. The applicant noted that clot formation in the blood 
samples was related to atrial thrombi. As the clot formation took place during/directly after blood 
collection, this conclusion indicates an increased state of blood coagulability. However, the applicant 
states that atrial thrombus formation is not very likely caused by alterations in blood coagulation 
capacity. The Applicant should note that an increased state of blood coagulation capacity may still be 
(part of) the cause of atrial thrombus formation. In addition, clot formation may be caused by an 
inappropriate ratio between blood volume and anti-coagulant in the collection tube. 
Taken together the design of the pivotal studies with dosing at very young age and the infeasibility to 
evaluate  parameters  early  after  dosing,  it  appears that  the  relevance  of  these  murine  studies  for the 
clinic, regardless the study outcomes, is only marginal. 
NHP IV administered with Zolgensma (non-GLP) 
In  a  non-GLP  study,  male  cynomolgus  Monkeys  were  IV  administered  with  a  relatively  low  dose  of 
6.7x1013  vg/kg  of  an  unknown  batch  (with  vector  titre  determined  via  non-validated  method).  No 
product-related  toxicity  was  observed,  but  part  of  the  data  (e.g.  necropsy)  was  missing,  hampering 
proper assessment of the results.  
Nevertheless, in a recently published study with a single IV injection of 2.0x1014 vg/kg AAV9-like vector 
carrying the SMN transgene, significant systemic inflammation, liver toxicity and neuronal degeneration 
were observed in juvenile rhesus macaques (with premature sacrifice of one animal) and neurological 
degeneration  was  found  in  piglets  (all  prematurely  sacrificed;  Hinderer  et  al.,  Human  Gene  Therapy, 
2018)  and  the  authors  conclude  that  this  is  a  platform-related  effect.  These  effects  may  have  been 
missed in the NHP study with Zolgensma due to the lower vector dose and/or batch type.  
Due to the limitations of this study, e.g. the relatively low dose (0.6-fold the proposed clinical dose and 
>3-fold  below  the  dose  used  in  the  murine  GLP  studies  where  overt  toxicity  was  noted),  the  lack  of 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 40/150 
 
  
 
 
ascending  dose  design,  the  quality  of  the  used  batch  (research  grade),  and  the  shortcomings  in  the 
(reported) data, this study is not regarded of additional value for the estimation of the clinical risks for 
Zolgensma. As in mice a dose of ~≥ 2.2 fold the clinical dose results in mortality, a safety study in an 
animal  species  more  close  to  human  would  have  been  helpful  to  determine  the  safety  profile  of  the 
product in relation to the dose. As currently human data from clinical studies are available, these data 
are preferred for determining the safety and efficacy profile of the product.  
Mice and NHP ICV/IT administered with Zolgensma (non-GLP) 
The Applicant conducted a 12 week and a 24 week non-GLP study, in which mice were administered a 
single  ICV  dose  of  3.3x1013  vg/kg  AXVS-101  aiming  at  more  effective  distribution  to  spinal  cord  and 
brain.  No  product-related  adverse  events  occurred  in  these  studies.  This  local  treatment  suggests  a 
reduced systemic exposure as it results in a lower antibody titre compared to the 10-fold higher IV dose. 
However, (systemic) distribution data in mice upon ICV administration is missing.   
A limited endpoint non-GLP single dose toxicity study was conducted in male cynomolgus monkeys aged 
4-6  months.  Animals  received  an  IT  administration  of  2x1013  vg/kg  Zolgensma  and  on  the  limited 
observations made, there were no apparent effects on body weight or haematology. One notable serum 
chemistry finding was in one animal receiving test article, in which ALT levels were markedly increased 
at 16 months post injection without histopathological correlates. This finding resolved at 18 months. In 
2  test  animals,  platelets  were  markedly  increased.  This  finding  was  transient  and  resolved  after  6 
months.  There  were  no  remarkable  histological  changes  that  could  be  attributed  to  administration  of 
Zolgensma. However, systemic transgene expression (a.o. in heart, liver, lung and skeletal muscles) and 
substantial  antibody  titres  (approximately  1:1600)  both  against  the  vector  and  the  transgene  were 
measured.  Also,  in  the  published  pharmacodynamic  data,  systemic  exposure  to  Zolgensma  upon  IT 
administration  of  1x1013  vg/kg  Zolgensma  to  1  year  old  NHP  was  observed  (Meyer  et  al.,  2014,  see 
section 2.1.7). These observations suggest systemic distribution of Zolgensma upon IT administration. 
No vector- or transgene-specific T cell responses were found in the IT NHP safety study.  
These explorative studies may show a potential for treatment of (older) patients with Zolgensma via ICV 
or IT administration. Nevertheless, several limitations to these studies preclude translation to the clinic 
or bridging IV to ICV/IT for potential future applications: 1) these studies were performed with a research 
batch (no. batch SMN-131002, pre-process A); 2) vector dose was determined with a non-validated PCR 
assay; 3) only a single vector dose instead of dose range was analysed (thus, no dose-response could 
be established); and 4) in the NHP study, only male animals were used. However, this also means that 
the results, suggesting absence of toxicity, cannot be extrapolated to the clinic with any certainty. 
Mutagenic and/or tumorigenic risk 
Neither studies on vector integration nor a justification for omission of such studies has been provided 
in the dossier. As Zolgensma is a non-integrative vector, it can theoretically integrate into DNA to a very 
low extent. Consequently, the risk for mutagenic and the tumorigenic potential is regarded to be very 
limited. The justification for not addressing vector integration in non-clinical studies is based on the fact 
that  only  a  small  portion  of  AAV  vectors  integrates into  the  genome,  while  most  of  the  DNA  remains 
episomally. If the vector integrates, it occurs random into regions of chromatin/DNA accessibility, without 
a preferential integration into critical sites. So far, no cases of insertional oncogenesis have been reported 
for AAV vectors. Although most of the clinical experience has been obtained upon treatment of adults, 
there are currently no hints suggesting that infants might be more susceptible to AAV-induced insertional 
oncogenesis.  
Transfer of the vector to offspring 
In NHP testis was positive for vector DNA and transgene RNA, although the cell type transduced (and 
thus potential risk of germ line transmission) was not determined. Moreover, no data regarding female 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 41/150 
 
  
 
 
ovaries were available. In mice, an unexplained higher SMN expression was found at the highest dose 
(3x1014 vg/kg) in female ovaries at week 12 compared to week 3 and 6 (study no. 8384031). Vector 
could theoretically distribute to offspring when it is present in the gametes. The low but persistent levels 
of vector DNA observed in gonads should have triggered further non-clinical analyses in accordance with 
the  Guideline  on  non-clinical  testing  for  inadvertent  germline  transmission  of  gene  transfer  vectors 
(EMEA/273974/2005).  
To justify the lack of germline transmission studies, the applicant discussed in detail existing literature 
data  on  inadvertent  germline  transmission  of  AAV  vectors.  Most  of  this  data  was  generated  with  the 
AAV2 serotype and indicate that the AAV vector DNA, although distributed to gonadal tissue and shed 
into the semen, does not transduce sperm cells and does not result in germline transmission in animal 
studies. However, other serotypes than AAV2 might have a different tropism for sperm cells and oocytes. 
On the other hand, AAV serotypes with high tropism for gonads have not been described so far, and the 
referenced literature addressing different serotypes demonstrated that the kinetics of vector clearance 
of AAV2 and AAV8 vectors from semen was dose- and time-dependent, but serotype-independent. This 
suggests that data generated with other serotypes could be transferred to other serotypes at least to 
some extent. 
As  the  biodistribution  data  of  Zolgensma  revealed  relatively  low  levels  of  vector  DNA  present  in  the 
gonads, there are no hints indicating that the biodistribution of the AAV9 serotypes would largely differ 
from  other  serotypes  such  as  AAV2  or  AAV8.  Based  on  these  considerations  and  the  fact  that  SMA1 
patients are treated at a very young age, it may be acceptable that no further non-clinical studies were 
conducted on inadvertent germline transmission. 
The risk for transfer of a non-integrative, non replicative vector to offspring via spermatocytes is low. As 
AVXS101  is  modified  AAV  vector  that  can  in  theory  not  multiply  itself,  it  is  anticipated  that  in  case 
spermatocytes  or its  progenitors  are transduced  with  the  product,  that  the  vector  will  be diluted out. 
Seen  the  extended  time  period  between  treatment  (preferably  before  the  age  of  6  months)  and  the 
reproductive age, the risk for transfer via male patients is regarded negligible. As oocytes are all present 
before birth and will start to mature in females during the period that they have reproductive potential, 
transduction of oocytes could potentially lead to transfer of the vector to offspring. It can be anticipated 
that the vector will readily dilute out in the developing embryo and may be transferred only to a limited 
number of cells in the final foetus. However, the potential risk for the offspring may be rather related to 
potential supraphysiological transgene expression levels that could putatively (dependent on the role of 
the transgene) interfere with early embryonic/foetal development. To that end, the applicant discussed 
potential interference  of  SMN  overexpression  with  early  embryonic development.  Because  SMN  levels 
appear to be higher in embryos compared to adults (although the levels compared to neonates have not 
been  mentioned),  presence  of  Zolgensma  related  SMN  copies  are  not  expected  to  impact  embryonic 
development.  As  smn1  expression  is  low  in  the  ovaries  following  Zolgensma  expression,  levels  in  a 
fertilized  oocyte  or  very  early  developing  embryo  may  not  largely  increase  the  level  of smn1  already 
present  in  this  very  early  stage  developing  embryo.  Due  to  the  continuous  cell  divisions,  it  can  be 
expected that the vector will readily dilute. It can thus be agreed with the Applicant that increased smn1 
expression will not pose a marked risk during very early stages of embryonic development.  
Of note; the Applicant mentions that SMN protein levels in the ovaries are transient. Furthermore, the 
Applicant mentions that patients surviving until reproductive age will likely not have transgenes in their 
oocytes. As these cells are resting until puberty, it is unclear why transgene would not persist in these 
cells.

2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
2.3.4.1.  Hazard identification 
Hazard identification identifies relevant characteristics of the medicinal product that may cause a harmful 
effect  on  human  health  or  the  environment.  Furthermore,  the  hazard  identification  evaluates  the 
potential consequences of the identified possible harmful effects, in case they occur.  
The AAV vector Zolgensma   
The genetically modified vector Zolgensma is derived from AAV. The viral vector is replication deficient 
due to the absence of the rep and cap genes. These deletions do not lead to a harmful effect such as 
increased  persistence  or  invasiveness.  On  the  contrary,  they  lead  to  reduced  persistence  and 
invasiveness  since  the  viral  vector  is  replication  deficient  because  of  these  deletions.  In  view  of  the 
normal function of the SMN protein in humans, there are no reasons to assume that the SMN protein 
has effects on the virus biology of AAV or that the protein can complement the functions of the rep and 
cap genes. Expression of the SMN protein by the viral vector therefore cannot lead to the formation of 
new virus particles. Because the capsid of the virus particle consists of AAV9 proteins, the host range 
and tissue tropism will be identical to AAV9. In neonate mice, administration of 1.5 x 1014, 2.4 x 1014 or 
3.0 x 1014 vg/kg Zolgensma via intravenous injection showed widespread biodistribution of the genome 
and expression of the construct at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-dosing, including in the brain and spinal cord, 
which indicated the vector was able to cross the blood-brain barrier when administered systemically. The 
highest levels of vector genome were detected in the heart, liver, lung and skeletal muscle. Similar to 
previous biodistribution studies with Zolgensma, low levels of vector genome were observed in the spleen 
relative to other tissues. A low level of vector genome and expression was also noted in the testis and 
ovary. 
In a second study, neonatal mice were injected intravenously with 6.7 x 1013 vg/kg or 3.3 x 1014 vg/kg. 
The presence and persistence of viral DNA at high copy number was demonstrated in the brain and spinal 
cord at all post injection intervals (3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks post injection) though the highest copy number 
was present in heart. High copy numbers were also noted in liver, lung, lymph node and muscle. The 
lowest  levels  were  detected  in  gonad  samples  and  intermediate  levels  were  measured  in  the  spleen, 
pancreas, kidney and jejunum. RNA expression of the SMN transgene was demonstrated in brain and 
spinal cord, the targeted therapeutic tissues. In addition, human SMN was consistently expressed in the 
kidney, lung, heart, liver and muscle. The gonad was the only tissue in which no expression was detected 
in  either  males  or  females  across  all  time  points,  which  indicates  the  integration  of  the  transgene  in 
germline cells is highly unlikely. Low levels of circulating antibodies to the AAV9 capsid were found after 
12 and 24 weeks in mice given 3.3 x 1014 vg/kg. However, no circulating antibodies to the SMN transgene 
were detected in any of the mice in the study, regardless of treatment group or time point. 
Potential hazards to human health 
Potential hazards to human health are related to (a) shedding of AAV vector particles, (b) the formation 
of rcAAV or recombinant viruses during manufacturing or after infusion and (c) insertional mutagenesis.   
Hazards related to shedding of vector particles 
Unintentional  exposure  of  non-target  individuals  to  the  GMO  may  result  in  expression  of  the  normal 
human SMN protein and induction of an immune response against the Zolgensma capsid proteins.  
Hazards related to complementation, recombination and rcAAV formation 
Vector  mobilisation  may  occur  in  a  helper  virus  infected  patient  because  of  the  generation  of  rcAAV 
during manufacture or because of complementation and recombination between the viral vector, wildtype 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 43/150 
 
  
 
 
AAV  and  a  helper  virus.  Dispersal  (dissemination) of  AAV  is  not  documented  definitively,  but  is  likely 
through inhalation (aerosolized droplets), contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose and mouth) and 
fecal-oral transmission.  
Hazards associated with recombination of the CMV and SV40 sequences in the viral vector with other 
viral sequences 
Genetic material may be exchanged because of interaction of viral sequences present in the construct 
(CMV and SV40 sequences) with other wildtype viruses present in the patient or non-target individual.   
Hazards related to insertional mutagenesis 
A  theoretical  risk  of  AAV  infection  is  the  risk  of  insertional  mutagenesis  caused  by  non-site-specific 
integration of the AAV genome into the host cell genome of infected cells.  
Hazards related to vertical transmission 
Germline transmission may occur if a productive infection and stable integration of the viral vector occurs 
in germ cells.  
Potential hazards to animal health 
Unintentional exposure of animals to the GMO may result in expression of the normal human SMN protein 
and induction of an immune response against the Zolgensma capsid proteins. 
Evaluation of potential consequences 
The  consequences  of  the  identified  potential  adverse  effects  are  evaluated,  in  case  they  occur.  The 
magnitude of each effect is assigned a relative weighting ranging from high, moderate, low to negligible.  
Consequences of shedding of vector particles 
Unintentional  exposure  of  non-target  individuals  to  the  GMO  may  result  in  expression  of  the  normal 
human SMN protein and induction of an immune response against the Zolgensma capsid proteins. The 
SMN protein will be constitutively expressed. This protein is of human origin and thus no immunogenic 
effect  is  expected.  In  the  Zolgensma-CL-101  study,  no  immune  response  against  the  transgene  was 
observed in the treated patients. According to the applicant, there are no known toxicities related to the 
expressed SMN protein. The SMN1 gene is the primary producer of SMN protein, a ubiquitously expressed 
protein that is essential in all tissues and is not associated with toxicity when overexpressed. While the 
protein product (SMN) from a single functional SMN gene is sufficient to prevent development of SMA, 
many individuals (13%) express 3 copies of SMN1, and almost 1% express 4 copies of SMN1, with no 
observable or known toxicity. Given the high prevalence of 4 copies of SMN1 in the general population 
(without  related  pathology),  it  is  clear  that  there  is  no  significant  toxicity  related  to  significant 
overexpression  of  SMN  in  humans.    The  GMO  is  replication  deficient  and  AAV  is  not  pathogenic.  An 
immune response against AAV9 capsid proteins will be asymptomatic, in the same way that a naturally 
occurring  infection  with  AAV  induces  an  asymptomatic  immune  reaction.  The  GMO  has  a  wide 
biodistribution and it is plausible that shedding will occur. According to the applicant, the consequences 
of shedding of vector particles are low.  
Consequences related to complementation, recombination and rcAAV formation  
Mechanisms that might lead to increased pathogenicity rely on the generation of a novel virus through 
recombination of viral vector sequences with wildtype AAV sequences.  
In a worst-case scenario, a replication-competent AAV expressing the human SMN gene would efficiently 
spread  from  patients  to  the  environment.  The  host-range  of  such  a  virus  would  include  humans  and 
other primates. It is not expected that expression of SMN would positively affect the viral biology of the 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 44/150 
 
  
 
 
vector  with  regard  to  replication  and  pathogenicity.  Furthermore,  new  replication  competent  viral 
particles that have acquired the rep and cap genes because of recombination will most likely be similar 
to wildtype AAV due to the limited packaging capacity of AAV. Wildtype AAV infections are common and 
not  associated  with  disease.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  consequences  of  recombination  are 
negligible.    
Consequences related to recombination of the CMV and SV40 sequences in the viral vector with other 
viral sequences 
Homologous  recombination  between  the  GMO  and  wildtype  CMV  or  wildtype  SV40  will  only  result  in 
reciprocal exchange. No consequences are associated with such a recombination because the properties 
of CMV or SV40 will not change due to recombination with the CMV or SV40 sequence from the GMO. 
Consequences related to insertional mutagenesis 
Preclinical data indicate that in most cases, DNA delivered by recombinant AAV vectors predominantly 
persists as extrachromosomal elements (episomes) rather than integrating into host cell genomes. The 
potential risk of incorporation of the viral genome into the patient chromosomal DNA is thought to be 
significantly reduced, as recombinant AAV vectors devoid of the rep gene are incapabe of site-specific 
integration into the AAVS1 site. However, the possibility of rare integration events may exist. According 
to the applicant, the consequences related to insertional mutagenesis are negligible. 
Consequences of vertical transmission 
Vertical transmission of AAV is not observed in (pre)clinical studies but cannot be completely excluded. 
However,  Zolgensma  is  reasonably  expected  to  be  used  in  infants  only.  Overall,  the  magnitude  of 
consequences associated with vertical transmission has been rated as negligible. 
Consequences to animal health 
The host-range of AAV9 includes humans and other primates. Unintentional exposure of animals to the 
GMO may result in expression of the normal human SMN protein and induction of an immune response 
against the Zolgensma capsid proteins. The SMN protein will be constitutively expressed. This protein is 
of human origin and an immunogenic effect might be expected in primates. According to the applicant, 
there are no known toxicities related to the expressed SMN protein. The GMO is replication deficient and 
AAV is not pathogenic. An immune response against AAV9 capsid proteins will be asymptomatic, in the 
same way that a naturally occurring infection with AAV induces an asymptomatic immune reaction. The 
GMO has a wide biodistribution and it is plausible that shedding will occur. The consequences of shedding 
of vector particles are rated as low.  
2.3.4.2.  Evaluation of likelihood  
The evaluation of likelihood considers the probability that previously identified harmful effects occur.  
Likelihood that consequences occur due to shedding of viral particles  
After administration the GMO will be able to enter the environment for a limited time by shedding. From 
a previous clinical trial with Zolgensma, it appears that shedding can occur in urine, saliva and stool. 
Levels representing 0.1 – 0.01% of the initial dose into the patient are found in urine and saliva at 1 day 
post-dosing, after which levels of Zolgensma shed into these matrices reach near the limit of quantitation 
of the assay. In stool, concentrations were declining approximately 4 logs (10,000-fold) over 30 days 
post  infusion.  Overall,  Zolgensma  was  primarily  cleared  from  the  body  in  stool  and  by  day  60  post 
infusion was below the limit of quantitation in stool. Because the amount of vector particles in non-target 
individuals will be many times lower than in patients, the chance of negative effects is reduced compared 
to  the  situation  in  patients.  The  likelihood  of  further  spreading  of  the  GMO  from  these  non-target 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 45/150 
 
  
 
 
individuals is negligible since the GMO is replication deficient. Additionally, the presence of viral vector 
DNA does not necessarily mean that infectious particles are present. Preclinical studies with recombinant 
AAV show that urine contains no infectious AAV particles and that infectious vector particles are limited 
to the plasma and removed from the circulation within 48 to 72 hours after administration. 
Also, replication deficient viral particles with non-vector related sequences can be temporarily excreted 
in  the  environment.  When  non-target  individuals  are  exposed  to  AAV  virus  particles  with  non-vector 
related sequences, such as the rep gene, kanamycin DNA or host cell DNA, no adverse effects are to be 
expected.  Over  90%  of  the  adult  human  population  is  seropositive  for  AAV.  As  a  result,  the  immune 
system recognizes and eliminates AAV particles. In the unlikely event that a possible infection of non-
target individuals occurs, this effect will extinguish due to the replication defective nature of the viral 
vector.  
The likelihood that shedding of viral particles occurs is high but the consequences are limited.  
Likelihood that consequences occur due to complementation, recombination and rcAAV formation   
During  production,  recombination  of  the  viral  vector  with  rep  and  cap  sequences  can  result  in  the 
generation of replication competent AAV. In addition, there is a theoretical chance that in the patient 
rcAAV may arise due to recombination. Recombination between the vector and wildtype AAV will most 
likely result in exchange of homologous sequences such as the ITRs. This allows the rep and cap genes 
of the wildtype AAV to be exchanged with the SMN expression cassette of the GMO. The resulting virus 
contains the SMN expression cassette but will still be replication deficient due to the absence of the rep 
and  cap  genes.  Furthermore,  AAV  has  a  limited  packaging  capacity,  making  it  unlikely  that  an  rcAAV 
vector will contain both the rep and cap genes and the transgene expression cassette.  
Zolgensma is tested for replication competent AAV (rcAAV). The method has been validated and is being 
performed  under  GMP  conditions.  The  proposed  commercial  acceptance  criterion  of  this  assay  is  a 
negative result. Analytical data from eight Zolgensma FP batches that were tested were all negative.  
The provided data are insufficient to conclude that the rcAAV assay is valid for testing the absence of 
rcAAV in a batch of Zolgensma. Furthermore, the applicant indicates that during validation of the assay, 
a default value was tested based on the amount and concentration of the material that AveXis was able 
to provide and that this level was continued to be used throughout validation and testing with the rcAAV 
assay. However, the amount of Zolgensma particles tested in the rcAAV assay is still unknown, since it 
is not mentioned how much material (e.g. how many μl) is used in the assay.   
However, the pSMN plasmid does not contain any elements of AAV replication or capsid proteins and the 
pAAV2/9  plasmid  does  not  contain  any  sequences  related  to  the  AAV  inverted  terminal  repeats, 
minimizing the likelihood of recombination and formation of rcAAV. 
After administration of the GMO, complementation of rep and cap genes can occur in the presence of 
wildtype AAV and replication of the vector may occur. The presence (co-infection of the same cell) of a 
helper virus, for example adenovirus or herpesvirus, is required for this. Complementation by wildtype 
AAV and a helper virus can result in the generation of new vector particles, which can subsequently infect 
another cell. In this newly infected cell, replication will only occur if the same conditions are met. This 
temporary replication will not occur in the absence of the helper virus and wildtype AAV and, as a result, 
any spreading of the virus will eventually be extinguished. 
In conclusion, the likelihood that infectious rcAAV is present in Zolgensma and is able to spread to non-
target individuals is very low according to the applicant.  
Likelihood of recombination of the CMV and SV40 sequences in the viral vector with other viral sequences 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 46/150 
 
  
 
 
Theoretically, it is possible that a recombinant virus is produced by recombination of the CMV or SV40 
sequence present in the AAV vector with wildtype CMV or wildtype SV40, respectively. According to the 
applicant, natural exchange of genetic material between the AAV vector and the donor organisms (CMV, 
SV40) is not known.  
Likelihood that consequences occur due to insertional mutagenesis 
As  far  as  known,  no  events  of  insertional  mutagenesis  were  observed  in  clinical  trials  involving 
recombinant  AAV  vectors.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  likelihood  of  insertional  mutagenesis  is 
negligible.  
Likelihood of vertical transmission 
Zolgensma is reasonably expected to be for used in infants only (SMA type 1 patients weighing between 
2.6  kg  to 21  kg).  According  to  the  applicant,  Zolgensma  does  not integrate  into  the  patient genome, 
germline cells are not impacted and the likelihood for germline transmission is negligible. 
Likelihood of consequences to animal health 
The host-range of AAV9 includes humans and other primates. The product is intended as a medicinal 
product  for  humans  only and  to  be  administered  in  a  PICU  patient  room  or  other  appropriate  setting 
(e.g. interventional suite, operating room, dedicated procedure room) with immediate access to acute 
critical  care  management.  After  administration,  Zolgensma  can  be  shed,  mostly  via  feces.  The 
concentrations  of  the  GMO  that  will  end  up  in  the  environment  will  be  many  times  lower  than  the 
administered  dose.  According  to  the  applicant,  exposure  of  animals  is  not  expected.  As  such,  the 
likelihood of consequences to animal health is negligible.  
2.3.4.3.  Estimation of the risk 
Risk of shedding of viral particles  
The  viral  vector  is  replication  deficient.  After  administration,  the  GMO  will  be  able  to  enter  the 
environment for a limited time by shedding. AAV infections are common and not associated with disease. 
The presence of viral vector DNA does not necessarily mean that infectious particles are present. Both 
for  the  AAV  vector  and  for  the  SMN  sequence  cloned  herein,  it  has  been  concluded  that  the  risks  for 
humans and the environment are negligible.  
Risk of complementation, recombination and rcAAV formation 
During  production,  recombination  of  the  viral  vector  with  rep  and  cap  sequences  can  result  in  the 
generation  of  replication  competent  AAV.  As  part  of  quality  control,  Zolgensma  is  tested  for  rcAAV. 
Analytical data from eight Zolgensma FP batches that were tested were all negative. 
However,  the  provided  data  are  insufficient  to  conclude  that  the  rcAAV  assay  is  valid  for  testing  the 
absence of rcAAV in a batch of Zolgensma and the amount of Zolgensma particles tested in the rcAAV 
assay is still unknown. Although the pSMN plasmid does not contain any elements of AAV replication or 
capsid proteins and the pAAV2/9 plasmid does not contain any sequences related to the AAV inverted 
terminal  repeats,  thereby minimizing  the  likelihood  of  recombination,  it  cannot  fully  be  excluded that 
there is rcAAV present in a batch of Zolgensma.   
Replication  of  AAV  requires  a  helper  virus  and,  as  a  result,  any  spreading  of  rcAAV  will  be  limited. 
Additionally,  recombinant  AAV  vectors  have  low  infectivity  and  require  high  virus  titers  for  efficient 
transduction of cells. Thus, in the unlikely event that rcAAV particles are shed from patients, these rcAAV 
particles hardly have the capacity to cause significant infections. Importantly, new replication competent 
viral particles that have acquired the rep and cap genes because of recombination will most likely be 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 47/150 
 
  
 
 
similar  to  wildtype  AAV  due  to  the  limited  packaging  capacity  of  AAV.  Wildtype  AAV  infections  are 
common and not associated with disease. 
In the patient, there is a possibility that new viral particles are formed as a result of complementation 
or recombination of the GMO with AAV rep and cap genes. To this end, it is necessary that the GMO, 
wildtype AAV and a helper virus are present in the same cell. No harmful effects are associated with the 
development of these new viral particles. New viral particles formed by complementation are identical 
to  the  GMO  and  will  still  be  replication  deficient  due  to  the  absence  of  the  rep  and  cap  genes.  New 
replication competent viral particles that possess the rep and cap genes because of recombination will 
most likely be similar to wildtype AAV due to the limited packaging capacity of AAV. The likelihood of the 
formation of these new viral particles is very unlikely because the GMO, wildtype AAV and a helper virus 
must be present in the same cell at the same time. 
Overall, the risk of complementation, recombination and rcAAV formation is regarded as negligible  
Risk of recombination of the CMV and SV40 sequences in the viral vector with other viral sequences 
Homologous recombination between the GMO and wildtype CMV or wildtype SV40 cannot be excluded 
but will only result in reciprocal exchange. The risk of recombination of the CMV or SV40 sequences with 
CMV or SV40, respectively, in the patient or non-target individual is negligible. 
Risk of insertional mutagenesis 
A  theoretical  risk  of  AAV  infection  is  the  risk  of  insertional  mutagenesis  caused  by  non-site-specific 
integration of the AAV genome into the host cell genome of infected cells. As far as known, no events of 
insertional mutagenesis were observed in clinical trials involving recombinant AAV vectors. According to 
the applicant, the risk of insertional mutagenesis is negligible. 
Risk of vertical transmission  
Vertical transmission of AAV is not observed in (pre)clinical studies but cannot be completely excluded. 
Human data on use of Zolgensma during pregnancy or lactation are not available and animal fertility or 
reproduction studies have not been performed. However, Zolgensma is reasonably expected to be for 
used in infants only (SMA type 1 patients weighing between 2.6 kg to 21 kg). Overall, the risk of vertical 
transmission can be considered as negligible. 
Risk of effects on animal health 
The  viral  vector  is  replication  deficient  and  does  not  replicate  in  the  absence  of  a  helper  virus.  After 
administration, the GMO will be able to enter the environment for a limited time by shedding. The host-
range of AAV9 includes humans and other primates. According to the applicant, exposure of animals is 
not expected. As such, the risk of effects on animal health is negligible.  
Risk estimation 
In  conclusion,  the  risk  for  the  environment  that  is  related  to  the  use  of  Zolgensma  is  considered 
negligible. 
2.3.4.4.  Risk management strategies 
Even though the overall risk of transmission or adverse events associated with Zolgensma is negligible, 
a  series  of  measures  have  been  taken  by  the  applicant  to  minimize  the  likelihood  of  spread  in  the 
environment or to non-target individuals. These are related to production, preparation and administration 
of the GMO, transport and waste treatment.  
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 48/150 
 
  
 
 
For infant patients who use diapers, to further reduce the potential for exposure to patient caregivers 
after subjects are discharged, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) will provide guidelines to family 
members and caregivers to practice good hand hygiene for a minimum of one month after Zolgensma 
administration. This requires washing hands with soap regularly and using appropriate protective gloves 
if coming into direct contact with bodily fluids and waste. Disposable diapers can then be disposed of in 
sealed disposable trash bags into the regular household waste stream. 
Because  the  environmental  risks  of  Zolgensma  are  negligible,  the  inclusion  of  additional  risk 
management strategies for reasons of environmental safety and safety of non-target individuals is not 
necessary. 
2.3.4.5.  Determination of the overall risk 
The overall risk for the environment posed by the GMO is negligible. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The applicant suggests that the clinical benefit is more likely related to the progressive loss of motor 
neurons than a change in transduction efficiencies as a result of age. While it is true that the AAV vector 
can  only  transduce  neurons  that  are  still  viable,  it  has  also  been  demonstrated  that  with  increasing 
postnatal  age,  the  percentage  of  transduced  glial  cells  is  increasing,  while  the  number  of  transduced 
neurons is decreasing depending on the CNS structure investigated.  
Age  may  influence  the  transduction  efficiency  upon  i.v.  administration  in  a  healthy  animal.  Data  on 
transduction efficiency (the percentages of transduced neurons) in NHPs treated at postnatal day 30 and 
90  was  not  present,  consequently  limiting  the  conclusions  on  the  influence  of  age  on  transduction  of 
neurons. Although AAV9 vector is able to reach the target tissue, there is no convincing quantitative data 
available  from  NHP  that  would  support  a  sufficient  transduction  efficiency  of  motor  neurons  after 
intravenous administration of Zolgensma to SMA patients at an age of > 6 months of age.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Because of the discrepancy between the human patient biodistribution data at single cell level and the 
murine biodistribution data at whole tissue level, the Applicant was asked to provide an overview of all 
available human whole tissue and single cell biodistribution data in comparison to whole tissue murine 
biodistribution data (from the GLP 12-week studies) to determine similarities and differences in 
transducability per tissue between mouse and human and discuss the expected murine biodistribution 
at single cell level based on these human data. Murine biodistribution data from the 12 and 24 weeks 
study was submitted.  Biodistribution data from two patients (study CL303and CL-302) that have been 
treated with Zolgensma at different ages (62 days versus 5 months of age, respectively) was also 
presented.  In mouse, the amount of vg/µg DNA seems to slightly decrease over time. It is not clear 
whether this is due to a biological process or whether this variation is inherent to the assay. When 
comparing 12-weeks mouse to 24-weeks human data, it is observed that in brains, humans have 
slightly higher levels of vg/µg DNA, whereas levels in Lumbar Spinal Cord are more similar between 
mouse and human. It is reassuring that in brain and spinal cord at least similar levels as in mice are 
reached in human. In the periphery, organs such as lung, heart and quadriceps muscle do show similar 
levels of vector genomes per µg DNA for mice and human. However, liver and especially spleen seem 
much more efficiently transduced in human when compared to mice.  
When comparing the two patients from study CL-303and study CL-302, it is observed that overall, the 
patient  from  study  CL-302seems  to  be  more  efficiently  transduced,  often  ±  >1,5  times  higher. 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 49/150 
 
  
 
 
Unfortunately, no data from the brain for patient from study CL-302 were presented by the applicant; 
however, these data were present in the clinical dossier. These data suggest that Zolgensma distribution 
to brains is approximately a factor 10 higher the patient in CL-302 as compared to the patient from CL-
303. Of note, it is not clear whether the data taken from the clinical dossier are collected in the same 
manner  as  the  data  presented  in  the  applicant’s  position  for  the  non-clinical  part.    Surprisingly  the 
pancreas  seems  more  efficiently  transduced  in  the patient  from  study  CL-302,  whereas  heart,  spleen 
and inguinal lymph node seem more efficiently transduced in the patient from study CL-303. Apparently, 
interpatient differences do exist. 
Overall,  the  above  presented  data  at  least  provides  an  indication  that  mice  and  man  are  similarly 
transduced,  with  some  differences  in  peripheral  tissues.  Furthermore,  changes  between  individual 
patients are present. Whether this is due to the age at time of transduction or whether this is influenced 
by other factors is not known but might be of interest for future research in this field.  
Although prednisolone is a prescribed co-medication, pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are not 
submitted. However, it may influence persistence and clearance of Zolgensma.  The applicant elaborated 
on the reasons for the prednisolone treatment of the treated patients and indicated that a prophylactic 
or therapeutic use of prednisolone has not been modelled prospectively in preclinical studies, which is 
considered obvious.  Unfortunately, a non-clinical study to the influence on and potential refinement of 
the prophylactic or therapeutic use of immunomodulatory agents for this in vivo gene therapy are not 
planned.  
Toxicology 
The relationship between the occurrence of cardiovascular toxicity and the use of the specific FVB mouse 
strain as well as the age of the animals at start of dosing are not clear. Insight in mechanisms underlying 
atrial thrombosis are limited.  The occurrence of cardiovascular toxicity in the clinic should be addressed 
in the clinic as extrapolation from non-clinical data is not possible.    
Differences  in  study  outcomes  (reversibility  of  the  lesions  and  the  occurrence  of  clinical  signs  and 
mortality)  between  both  pivotal  12-week  studies  are  present.    The  applicant  considered  distinct 
pathological  terminology  the  reason  for  potential  differences  in  clinical  and  pathological  observations 
between study no. 20122446 and no. 8384031, explaining part of the differences. Toxicity in both studies 
occurred in the same organs (primarily liver and heart) and comparable lesions were found (e.g. atrial 
thrombosis).  Differences  in  the  severity  of  these  lesions  may  be  assigned  to  distinct  pathological 
terminology, although liver findings were not reversible by week 12 in study no. 8384031, while recovery 
was found in study no. 20122446.  
However, mortality is not regarded related to terminology. It is striking that none of the animals in the 
mid-dose  group  in  study  no.  20122446  (i.e.  2.37x1014  vg/kg)  died  prematurely,  while  considerable 
mortality was present in the comparable mid-dose group in study no. 8384031 (i.e. 2.4x1014 vg/kg: 6 
animals  died  due  to  product-related  toxicity).  In  addition,  already  in  the  low-dose  group  in the  latter 
study (i.e. 1.5x1014 vg/kg) 3 animals died prematurely, although relation to the procedure or test article 
is not clear. Thus, although within study no. 8384031 a mortality dose-response was present, this dose-
response  is  not  fully  seen  when  the  results  of  both  studies  are  taken  together.  The  reason  for  the 
difference  in  mortality  between  both  studies  could  have  been  incorrect  dosing  or  differences  in  batch 
potency  could have  played  a  role but  is  not  clarified.    Because  histopathology  was  described  in  more 
detail  and  peer-reviewed  in  study  no.  8384031,  results  from  this  study  are  considered  most  reliable 
among the GLP studies in mice using the IV route of administration.  
The  applicant  argued  in  their  response  to  the  second-round  questions  that  the  product-related 
cardiovascular and liver findings are most likely the result of AAV platform effects and not specific for 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 50/150 
 
  
 
 
the product or the transgene. Although literature (e.g. Hinderer et al., 2018) confirms the presence of 
platform effects, product-specific toxicity due to immune responses against the transgene or high/broad 
transgene expression in animals cannot be excluded(as also e.g. stated in Domenger and Grimm, Human 
Molecular  Genetics,  vol.  28,  2019  with  specific  attention  for  the  second  paragraph  on  page  3  and 
corresponding references). The promotor used in the AVXS101 vector could play a role in this very high 
transgene expression in certain tissues, resulting in stress-related cell death. 
The  applicant  mentions  that  no  abnormal  cardiovascular  observations  have  been  made  in  patients 
(except for transient increases in troponin-I). It is likely that the concurrent use of prednisolone has a 
protective effect on both liver and heart, thereby preventing life-threatening conditions (inflammation) 
as seen in mice. Nevertheless, the applicant is aware of the need to monitor cardiovascular and liver 
parameters in patients, which is encouraged.  
Although the Applicant has provided some information of the development of ventricle lesions over time. 
No discussion related to the atrium lesions (ultimately leading to thrombosis), liver lesions or the other 
pathology  found  in  the  tissues  was  provided.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  was  asked  elaborate  on  the 
(temporary) haematological changes and there clinical relevance. The Applicant should also discuss the 
most likely sequence of the different findings (i.e. clinical events, haematological findings, pathological 
lesions, reversion of lesions, mortality), starting with the transduction of specific tissues with the vector, 
leading to the adverse events found in the studies (i.e. which effects first, which effects as a result of 
that, etc.). The applicant only elaborated at high level on the development of pathological lesions, most 
likely  because  these  lesions  are  already  present  at  3  weeks  and  no  mechanistic  toxicity  studies  have 
been  performed.  In  addition,  no  attempts  to  explain  (product-related)  effects  on  haematological 
parameters such as thrombocytopenia were made.  As the symptoms are manageable in the clinic, the 
lack of mechanistic understanding can be agreed.  
During the third round, the applicant announced that it appeared that two more non-clinical studies were 
conducted that appeared relevant for but were not submitted with the Zolgensma application currently 
under  review  at  the  EMA.  This  concerned  1)  a  (final)  report  for  an  early  GLP  toxicology  study  in  the 
mouse initiated in February 2017 and with final draft report issued in August 2017 and 2) final contributor 
histopathology report (dated May 6, 2019) as well as the remainder of the study report from a non-GLP 
intrathecal administration cynomolgus monkey biodistribution study with Zolgensma with or without two 
types of intrathecal contrast agent. Approximately one week later, the applicant shared an high level 
assessment report with the authorities to provide information on new preclinical safety findings from an 
exploratory  biodistribution  and  safety  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  upon  IT  administration  of  the 
product. The study identified the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as a 
new target organ of toxicity for Zolgensma following intrathecal dose administration. A summary from 
the applicant is provided below:  
•  Cynomolgus monkeys negative for AAV9 antibodies were administered intrathecal (IT), Zolgensma 
in  the  presence  or  absence  and  euthanized  2  weeks  post-injection.  All  animals  survived  the  2-
week observation period with no clinical evidence of neuronal toxicity.  
• 
In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), minimal to marked mononuclear cell inflammation was observed, 
with neuronal satellitosis, neuronal necrosis, or complete neuronal loss with rare mineralisation at 
histopathology severity grades of mild, moderate or marked (grades 2-4).  
•  The DRG was not identified as a target organ of toxicity in previous Zolgensma studies conducted 
in mice (ICV route of administration) or cynomolgus monkeys (IV or IT routes of administration). 
However,  similar  findings  have  been  reported  after  administration  of  adeno-associated  virus 
serotype  9  (AAV9)  vectors  in  monkeys  and  minipigs  (AveXis  Study  RPT-1183;  Hinderer  et  al., 
2018; Hordeaux et al., 2018).  
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 51/150 
 
  
 
 
•  The Zolgensma batch used on this study did not meet GMP specifications, and the study had no 
concurrent vehicle control group. 
In conclusion, given that these findings were not previously observed with Zolgensma administration, 
they represent a new, adverse, potentially serious, and unexpected safety finding for Zolgensma. 
It appears that in the NHP IT study submitted with the IV application (no. CSF-AAV9-SMN-NHP 001), in 
which vacuolisation in DRG neurons was observed in 1/3 animals (regarded background finding, by then), 
animals were dosed 2x lower as in the newly presented study data (no. ITFS-101). Furthermore, toxicity 
findings in DRG neurons were also observed in a study with AAV9 administered IV to NHP (and piglets) 
as  published  by  Hinderer  and  colleagues  (2018)  in  which  the  animals  were  dosed    2  x  1014  Vg/Kg, 
apparently 2x higher that the proposed clinical dose for the current IV application. In a study published 
by Hordeaux and colleagues (2018), DRG toxicity was also observed in NHP after an ICM administered 
dose of 1x1013 vg AAV9-IDUA. In their notification, the company referred to an AVEXIS study in which, 
with an IT dose of another AAV9 vector, also inflammation and degeneration of the DRG neurons was 
observed.  
Quick comparison of all these data may suggest that the dose level could be influencing the occurrence 
or the revelation of the effect on DRG neurons in the spinal cord. The applicant was asked to elaborate 
on the consequence of this finding for the current intravenous application. In the discussion the applicant 
was asked to consider the differences in dose levels used in the various studies, to compare the findings 
in IT and IV studies with AAV9 (both private and literature data) and touch upon mechanism of action, 
use of corticosteroids and translatability.  
Overall, the applicant has made assumable that DRG toxicity that is observed within 2 weeks up to a 
few months post administration is possibly related to both innate and adaptive immune responses 
upon AAV9-mediated in vivo transduction. DRG findings in ITFS-101 were observed in Zolgensma 
administered young adults that were analysed two weeks post injection when the immune response 
may have been maximal. Animals in study CSF-AAV9-SMN-NHP-001 were given an approximately 
2fold higher dose at younger age, but only analysed 18 months post injection, and not specifically for 
pathological DRG toxicity. Absence of DRG toxicity findings in this study may have several reasons. It 
could be the case that DRG toxicity was missed as DRG was not a target organ for microscopically 
histopathological analysis, or that younger animals are less susceptible or that DRG toxicity was 
reversed after 18 months and therefore not visible anymore. In NHP, DRG toxicity seems not 
correlating with neurological symptoms, in contradiction to piglets, which showed effects of 
proprioceptive deficits and ataxia that are regarded species-specific. In several studies from the 
applicant or studies published in literature it has been shown that in NHP immunosuppression 
attenuates effects related to innate and adaptive immune responses in animals (and human). 
Attenuation of DRG toxicity upon immune suppression was not so clear in animals after ICM (intra 
cisterna magna) administration of AAV9-IDUA or AAV9-IDS to rhesus macaque. However, it may not 
exclude that it could attenuate DRG toxicity in human, thereby further downgrading the risk for DRG 
toxicity in patients treated in the clinic with Zolgensma. 
Severity of DRG findings may be dose-dependent and it is suggested that the local vector 
concentration for DRG neurons is relatively high upon IT administration as compared to IV 
administration. The applicant suggests that this may differ with a factor 10 and that this factor may be 
applied when extrapolating IT data to IV application. In addition, also not so clearly stated in the 
answer of the applicant, a factor 10 could be applied between NHP and human with regard to 
extrapolation of IT data as cynomolgus monkey are thought to have only 10% of the humans CSF 
volume.  
The applicant predicts that IV DRG findings would remain sub-clinical through a dose range up to ~3-
5e15 vg administered intravenously. These doses are approximately 3-5-fold the recommended clinical 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 52/150 
 
  
 
 
dose of 1.1e14 vg/kg and suggests the risk of clinically relevant DRG findings is very low. It is not 
clear how the applicant comes to this safe dose. It is likely that this dose was determined on the 
absence of symptomatic DRG findings in clinical studies administering 2.4e14 vg Zolgensma, 
corresponding to 2.3e13 vg/kg, co-administered with immunosuppressive medication. When applying 
the proposed factor 10, a dose of 2.8e14 vg/kg IV in combination with immunosuppression would not 
likely to result in symptomatic DRG toxicity. But this dose is slightly lower than the safe dose as 
proposed by the applicant. Whether DRG toxicity on the pathological level would occur in human 
remains unclear. When applying the factor 10 to the NHP study ITFS-101 and extrapolate on a 
bodyweight basis, the ITFS-101 study would suggest that a dose of 1.08e14 vg/kg IV (without 
immunosuppression) would result in DRG findings such as minimal to marked mononuclear cell 
infiltration and neuronal necrosis in rare cases. When taking into consideration a factor 10 scaling 
based on the CSF volume difference between monkeys and human, it could be expected that a dose of 
1.08e15 vg/kg IV to human in absence of immune suppressive medication would result in pathological 
DRG toxicity. However, DRG microscopic findings would not likely have symptomatic correlates.  
In any case, it is regarded really valuable that monitoring for symptoms of DRG toxicity is proposed by 
the applicant upon IV administration of Zolgensma.   
The  Applicant  was  asked  to  submit  and  discuss  findings  in  the  reports  of  the  two  studies  that  were 
identified lately not to be communicated yet with the authorities, i.e. 1) an early GLP toxicology study in 
the mouse initiated in February 2017 with final draft report issued in August 2017, and 2) final contributor 
histopathology report (dated May 6, 2019) as well as the remainder of the study report from a non-GLP 
intrathecal administration cynomolgus monkey biodistribution study with Zolgensma with or without two 
types of intrathecal contrast agent. 
The Applicant has provided both reports: 
1)  A  12-week  GLP-compliant  toxicity  study  was  performed  with  a  research  development  batch 
(produced in between process A and process B) to assess the potential toxicity of Zolgensma in the 
CNS. Mice were IV administered a single dose of 4.63x1013 vg/kg or 3.58x1014 vg/kg Zolgensma at 
PND1.  This  is  approximately  0.4-  and  3.3-fold  the  intended  clinical  dose  of  1.1x1014  vg/kg.  AAV 
genomic  titer  was  determined  with  the  validated  ddPCR  method.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the 
batch contained 44% empty capsid and was therefore not representative of test material intended 
for use in the study.  
The current data raise considerable safety concerns related to Zolgensma at high dose (i.e. mortality 
with considerable liver damage, atrial thrombosis, pulmonary oedema and coagulopathy), while e.g. 
mortality was not present in the 24-week study no. AD49TV.7A32.BTL (conducted with pre-process 
A batch). Most likely, the Applicant did not consider the test material suitable for the current study 
and decided to perform two additional studies with process B-material, which is endorsed. However, 
these two studies (no. 20122446 and 8384031) resulted in comparable clinical signs, pathology (in 
liver and heart) and mortality as the current study. This suggests that the NC safety issues are not 
solely related to specific batches and that Zolgensma administration carries intrinsic safety risks for 
liver and cardiovascular damage with coagulopathy when used in young animals, especially at high 
doses. Clinically, the Applicant is aware of these risks, which can be (partly) mitigated with immune 
suppression and proper monitoring. 
2)  A 2-week (non-GLP) toxicity study was performed with a batch rejected for clinical/commercial use 
to assess the safety of IT-delivered Zolgensma. Male cynomolgus macaques were IT administered 
(with Trendelenburg position) a single dose at the age of 1.4-2.9 years. Animals were euthanised 2 
weeks post-injection. 
IT administration of AAV9-GFP or Zolgensma led to transduction of spinal motor neurons throughout 
the whole spinal cord. Zolgensma resulted in DRG inflammation and perivascular mononuclear cell 
infiltrates  in  epineurium  and  meninges  of  both  brain  and  spinal  cord  (and  in  several  peripheral 
EMA/200482/2020  
Page 53/150 
 
  
 
 
tissues). DRG inflammation was rated minimal (i.e. no neuronal necrosis) to severe (i.e. neuronal 
necrosis or complete loss). Incidence and severity of this inflammation were the highest in sacral 
DRG compared to DRG more close to the brain. 
3)  DRG  inflammation  consisted  primarily  of  CD3+  lymphocyte  infiltration,  although  a  role  of  other 
immune cells (e.g. innate cells) in the inflammation was also observed. The extent of lymphocyte 
infiltration was related to the amount of AAV (i.e. genomic material or capsid protein) present within 
the DRG.  
Taken together, the presence of cell infiltrates in various tissues may be related to the IT delivery 
method and/or could even be (partly) considered a background finding (but no saline-injected control 
group  was  present  to  confirm  or  disprove  this).  Nevertheless,  specific  lymphocyte  infiltration  and 
neuronal damage seen in the DRG are most likely Zolgensma-related and considered adverse. The 
clinical  relevance  of  this  finding  and  whether  it  is  also  observed  after  IV  administration  remains 
unclear. 
The Applicant was also asked to provide any histo(patho)logy data from CNS and peripheral tissues 
available from IV NHP studies (for example, but may be not limited to, the study entitled “Analysis of 
Vector Safety Following a Single Systemic Delivery of scAAV9.CB.SMN into Cynomolgus Macaques”). 
The Applicant states that only one IV study with Zolgensma has been performed in NHP using a 
research-grade batch, for which the dose was considerably lower (6.7x1013 vg/kg) compared to the 
clinical dose. In addition, the Applicant states that “histopathology changes noted in the IV dosed NHP 
Zolgensma study at 6.7e13 vg/kg were reported to be minimal and similar to controls.” Nevertheless, 
no histopathological data have been provided. Because this report may have been poorly documented, 
data from the IT NHP study (with DRG histopathology data) and from publications may be more 
informative. These data are provided and assessed in the discussion of the Applicant related to the 
comparison of findings in IT and IV studies with AAV9 (see above). 
Finally, the Applicant was requested to provide an update of section 5.3 of the SmPC with provided 
murine and/or NHP information if relevant to the prescriber for the current IV application. The 
Applicant proposed to add a paragraph on the DRG findings (after IT administration). The wording of 
this paragraph required further adaptation, which is further assessed in the separate SmPC document.    
Based on the DRG events in NHP after IT administration and the uncertainties related to the relevance 
of DRG events for IV administration of Zolgensma, additional monitoring of sensory motor neurons 
functionality in patients treated with Zolgensma is considered needed. This is further assessed in the 
clinical AR.  
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The Zolgensma related and dose-dependent major finding in the heart of mice after IV administered of 
Zolgensma at neonatal stages includes atrial thrombosis which results in unscheduled mortality in a 
significant number of animals. Zolgensma related cardiovascular toxicity have not been observed to 
occur in clinical studies with Zolgensma manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process 
(Process B). DRG toxicity as observed upon IT administration of Zolgensma to cynomolgus monkey are 
not likely to be observed in human upon the current proposed dose regimen. However, it is regarded 
really valuable that monitoring for symptoms of DRG toxicity is proposed by the applicant upon IV 
administration of Zolgensma.   
Zolgensma can be approved from non-clinical perspective.   
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
To  date,  the  clinical  development  program  for  Zolgensma  includes  9  studies,  7  interventional  and  2 
observational.  Six  studies  were  included  in  the  dossier.  As  of  the  cut-off  date  of  31  Dec  2019,  133 
patients have received Zolgensma in clinical studies, 101 have received Zolgensma intravenously (98 of 
these at the proposed therapeutic dose and 3 at a lower dose), and 32 patients have received Zolgensma 
intrathecally. 
Note In study CL-101 the process A product was used. In the studies CL-303, CL-302 and CL-304 the 
process B product is used.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Zolgensma  is  a  viral  gene  therapy  product  to  be  administered  intravenously.  Conventional  clinical  PK 
studies are not possible for a viral gene therapy product. In humans, the presence of the viral vector in 
blood, shedding into excreta and the immunogenicity is investigated. Other PK studies for the viral vector 
are not feasible. The limited number of PK studies is acceptable for a viral vector. 
The  adeno  associated  virus  serotype  9  (AAV9)  viral  vector  carrying  the  SMN  gene  is  designed  for 
non-integration  into  the  host  genome  and  to  reside  as  a  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  episome  in  the 
nucleus of transduced cells. Recent literature suggests that SMN protein can be measured in plasma in 
excreted  episomes.  The  Applicant  will  investigate  biomarkers  (SMN  protein  and  neurofilament  light 
and/or  heavy  chain)  in  intravenously  treated  patients  at  baseline  and  during  LTFU,  allowing  for 
correlation of (pre-)treatment biomarkers and efficacy results.  
Zolgensma is intended to be administered as a single IV infusion at a dose of 1.1 × 10E14 vector genome 
copies/kg in paediatric patients with SMA. Premedication with oral prednisolone should always be given 
24 hours prior to infusion at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day and continued for at least 30 days followed by a 
tapering  regimen.  The  prednisolone  dose  regime  includes  tapering  off  scheduled  is  described  in  the 
Product information.  
To date, the clinical dossier for Zolgensma includes 6 studies in which the PK was investigated. 
Analytical methods 
The adaptive immunological responses to Zolgensma were monitored in study CL-101 using four different 
analytical  techniques:  ELISA  for  anti-AAV9  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  antibodies,  ELISpot  for  T-cell-
mediated immunity to AAV9, ELISA for anti-SMN antibodies and ELISpot for T-cell-mediated immunity 
to  hSMN.  Furthermore,  droplet  digital  polymerase  chain  reaction  (ddPCR)  was  used  to  measure  shed 
virus. 
The  analytical  methods  seem  to  be  sufficiently  validated  to  accurately  determine  the  immunological 
response  in  patients  after  Zolgensma  administration  and  to  determine  the  shed  virus.  The  ddPCR 
technique was not able to discriminate between empty viral capsules and intact Zolgensma containing 
the SMN1 gene DNA sequence. The anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays were not a quantitative assay. 
Absorption 
During the conduct of the studies, the Applicant changed the method used to determine the number of 
vector genomes in the administered dose and therefore it is difficult to compare the dosing between the 
studies. The highest dose used in the clinical trials was 1.1× 1014 vector genome copies/kg using ddPCR. 
In study CL-101 also a lower dose was used in 3 patients.  
Conventional  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  are  not  possible  for  a  viral  gene  therapy  product. 
Therefore, no PK parameters (e.g. AUC and Cmax) are available. Absorption is 100% following intravenous 
administration.  AVXS  101  is  expected  to  behave  as  other  AAV9s  after  intravenous  administration. 
Therefore,  data  on  biodistribution  and  shedding  of  other  AAV9  could  be  used  to  support  the 
biodistribution  and  shedding  of  Zolgensma.  However,  there  is  currently  no  literature  on  the 
biodistribution and shedding of AAV9 other than Zolgensma in humans and therefore no comparison can 
be made with other AAV9 viral vectors. 
Distribution 
The biodistribution in humans is based on information on the biodistribution in non-human primates. In 
non-human primates, long-term transgene expression was detected in most tissues, including liver, CNS, 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 59/150 
 
 
  
  
heart, triceps, diaphragm, and quadriceps except for intestines which had little or no expression. This 
indicates  that  the  viral  vector  is  able  to  distribute  from  the  systemic  circulation  into  the  tissues  and 
transfect these tissues. 
Human biodistribution data was submitted for two deceased patients (from study CL-303and study CL-
302) and indicated that intravenously administered Zolgensma at a dose of 1.1 × 1014 vg/kg crosses the 
blood brain barrier in an extent sufficient for transduction of the CNS cells from brain to lumbar/sacral 
spinal cord. Furthermore, these biodistribution data indicate that intravenously administered Zolgensma 
at  a  dose  of  1.1  ×  1014  vg/kg  effectively  transduces  cells  throughout  the  body  with  detection  of 
Zolgensma vector genomes in the CNS, all investigated peripheral organs and (skeletal) muscle. It also 
confirms the liver and heart being identified off-target organs of Zolgensma. 
Excretion 
Clearance of Zolgensma is primarily via the faeces and the majority of the dose is cleared within 30 days 
of dose administration. The risks for adverse effects in healthy humans after shedding is considered low. 
Immunogenicity 
An immunological response, as expected, was observed against AAV9 after intravenous administration 
of Zolgensma. The immunological response is expected to be transient but based on the long-term data 
derived  from  CL-101  and  LT-001  seems  to  be  sustained.  No  immunological  response  was  observed 
against hSMN. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Zolgensma is designed to increase the expression levels of the SMN protein in the motor neurons. Proof 
of the mechanism of action mainly comes from the non-clinical studies.  
No designated PD studies were carried out for this gene therapy product.  
There are no validated pharmacodynamic markers of SMA drug response in the published literature.  
CMAP  (compound  muscle  action  potential)  and  MUNE  (motor  unit  number  estimation)  are  commonly 
used to study neuromuscular function in neuromuscular disorders. In a recently published natural history 
study of subjects with SMA, the effects over time on CMAP (ulnar) in SMA patients were characterized 
and compared to healthy controls1. CMAP amplitude and area were stable in healthy controls (amplitude 
between 5.5-6 mV). CMAP amplitude was never higher than 0.6 mV in infants with SMA type 1 and who 
were 6-months of age or older.  
MUNE represents the estimated number of motor neurons or axons innervating the muscle or group of 
muscles being tested. In a study of 89 subjects with SMA (types 1, 2, and 3), denervation was assessed 
via MUNE2. From cross-sectional data, changes in MUNE over time were dependent on age, SMA type, 
and SMN2 copy number. SMA Type correlated with MUNE values and functional outcomes, with lower 
MUNE values and worse functional outcomes in SMA type 1.  
CMAP and MUNE were measured as indirect PD markers in study CL-101.  
Study CL-101 is a Phase 1, open-label, single-infusion, ascending-dose, single-centre study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in up to 15 patients with Type 1 SMA (see also section2.5.3.1. ).  
The  CMAP  size  was  found  using  supramaximal  stimulation  of  the  motor nerve  to  a  defined  muscle  or 
muscle group. It was recorded using surface electrodes and was representative of the sum of the surface 
detected motor unit action potentials from muscles innervated by that nerve.

Results 
Patients treated with the advised dose (Cohort 2) achieved sustained improvements in both peroneal 
CMAP amplitude (1.67 mV, 320% increase) and ulnar CMAP amplitude (0.87 mV, 125% increase) at 12-
months post-dose. Seven of the 10 subjects with CMAP values at the Month 6 Study Visit or later had 
ulnar CMAP amplitudes >0.6 mV. Two subjects had ulnar CMAP >5 mV at the Month 6 Study Visit. For 
comparison, healthy children have a mean ulnar CMAP amplitude of 5.5-6 mV. 
At 24 months post-dose, patients in Cohort 2 achieved sustained improvements in both peroneal CMAP 
amplitude (2.20 mV, 634.3% increase) and ulnar CMAP amplitude (0.84 mV, 141.7% increase).  
At 12 months post-dose, subjects in the low dose group (Cohort 1) achieved a slight improvement in 
peroneal CMAP amplitude (0.10 mV, 58% increase) while ulnar CMAP amplitude decreased at the 12-
month post-dose time point (-0.10 mV, -33% decrease). At 24 months post dose, subjects in Cohort 1 
achieved  a  slight improvement in peroneal  CMAP  amplitude  (0.20  mV,  116.7%  increase),  while  ulnar 
CMAP amplitude decreased (-0.10 mV, -33%).

Figure 3:Mean Change for Ulnar CMAP [mV] 
Patients in Cohort 2 achieved sustained improvements in MUNE (58% increase) at the 12 months post-
dose time point. Subjects in Cohort 1 showed a 50% decline from baseline at the 12 months post-dose 
time point. At the 24 months post-dose time point patients in Cohort 2 achieved sustained improvements 
in MUNE (82% increase). Subjects in Cohort 1 showed a 34% decline from baseline in the 24 months 
post-dose time point. 
The effects of Zolgensma produced according to process A on CMAP and MUNE are in general considered 
supportive of the overall clinical efficacy observed in the study. 
Immune response and efficacy 
A detailed immunogenicity report was submitted for study CL-101 (process A). The first patient treated 
with  Zolgensma  in  Study  CL-101  had  increase  in  transaminases.  In  an  attempt  to  dampen  the  host 
immune  response  to  the  AAV  derived  therapy,  all  subsequent  patients  were  pre-treated  with 
prednisolone prior to dosing.  
T-cell mediated immunity and efficacy.  
There  was  no  apparent  immune  response  against  hSMN1.  After  treatment  T-cell  mediated  immunity 
against AAV9 was present in all patients as measured by ELISpot.  
In  patients  with  the  highest  ELISpot  values,  similar  responses  in  CHOP-INTEND  score  and  motor 
milestone  achievement  (secondary  endpoints,  see  efficacy  section)  were  observed  as  compared  to 
patients with lower ELISpot values.  
This suggests that there are no relationships between baseline and post-baseline ELISpot and efficacy. 
Humoral immune response and efficacy. 
There was no apparent immune response against hSMN1.  
All patients had increases in anti-AAV9 titres throughout the course of the study. These increases are 
considered an expected response to treatment with Zolgensma. Most patients (10) had increases in anti-
AAV9  titres  to  >  1:50  at  week  1,  with  even  greater  increases  thereafter.  Eleven  patients  had  titres 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 62/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
greater than the limit of quantification (> 1:819200) at some point during the study. No patients returned 
to titres < 1:50 after dosing. All patients remained elevated (≥ 1:25600) at the last reported time point 
and 3 patients had anti-AAV9 titres greater than the limit of quantification at the last reported time point.  
Of the 2 patients who had pre-dose anti-AAV9 antibody titres of 1:50 , increases in CHOP-INTEND scores 
in these patients were comparable to patients receiving the therapeutic dose and both patients achieved 
motor  milestones  of  sitting  alone  ≥  30  seconds,  which  surpasses  or  is  equivalent  to  the  milestones 
achieved of 6 of the other 10 patients in Cohort 2. 
Eight patients out of 12 in Cohort 2 had anti-AAV9 titres that exceeded the higher limit of quantification. 
The development of anti-AAV9 antibodies had no apparent impact on efficacy. In patients who had anti-
AAV9  titres  that  exceeded  the  limits  of  quantification,  there  were  no  apparent  differences  between 
patients  who  had  larger  anti-AAV9  titres  and  clinical  outcome  as  measured  by  survival,  achieving 
milestones or CHOP-INTEND. With the exception of patient E08, all patients from Cohort 2, achieved and 
maintained CHOP-INTEND motor function scores greater than 40. Seven of these patients had anti-AAV9 
titres that exceeded the higher limit of quantification. Two patients in Cohort 2 achieved CHOP-INTEND 
scores above 60 points and both had anti-AAV9 titres that exceeded the level of quantification. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Generally, the pharmacokinetics of Zolgensma have been sufficiently evaluated.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The underlying cause of 5q SMA is a bi-allelic deletion/ point mutation of the SMN1 gene, making 
patients dependent on the insufficient production of the SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. By replacing 
mutated SMN1 protein with fully functional SMN1 in motor neurons, Zolgensma is expected to 
contribute to motor neuron survival and extend survival in SMA patients. Proof for this mechanism of 
action is primarily obtained from non-clinical studies since it is not possible at the moment to measure 
SMN1 protein in treated patients. However, there are indications that SMN1 protein can be measured 
in plasma in excreted episomes. The Applicant will measure SMN levels in Study CL-305 to explore the 
relationship of SMN protein levels to onset and extent of clinical efficacy. In addition, the Applicant will 
add SMN protein level measurement to the LT-001 and LT-002 protocols to explore the relationship of 
SMN protein levels to durability of clinical efficacy. 
There  is  also  no  validated  pharmacodynamic  marker  for  SMN1  protein  replacement.  Therefore,  no 
dedicated PD studies were conducted. However, pharmacodynamic measures of muscle innervation were 
investigated in the dose-finding study CL-101, i.e. CMAP (compound motor action potential) and MUNE 
(motor unit number estimation). In the low dose cohort (cohort 1), CMAP did not improve consistently 
12  and  24  months  post-dose.  In  the  high  dose  cohort  (cohort  2),  CMAP  did  improve  both  12  and  24 
months post-dose, above the level that would normally be expected from natural history.  
In the NeuroNext study, CMAP was shown to positively correlate with motor functional ability. In addition, 
the patients with the highest increase from baseline in CMAP in study CL-101 (E06-965 and E10-243) 
were also the patients that reached the highest motor milestone and CHOP-INTEND score in study CL-
101 (walking unassisted), see clinical section. 
The genotype (i.e. number of SMN2 copies) of a 5q SMA patient is roughly predictive for the phenotype 
and thus the progression of the disease. In the presence of a bi-allelic mutation/deletion of SMN1, having 
2  SMN2  copies  is  97%  predictive  for  developing  SMA  type  13.  With  higher  SMN2  copy  numbers,  the 
3 Feldkotter et al,  Am. J. Hum. Genet. 70:358–368, 2002 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 63/150 
 
 
  
  
 
association with phenotype becomes more complex. Large studies (3459 cases) demonstrated that in 
patients with 3 SMN2 copy numbers the three major phenotype categories are present: ~15% have a 
SMA  Type  1  phenotype  and  never  sit,  ~55%  have  SMA  Type  2  who  sit  but  never  stands/walks,  and 
~30%  have  SMA  Type  3 4 (Calucho  2018).  Per  protocol,  patients  with  1  or  2  SMN2  copies  could  be 
included  in  study  CL-303  and  CL-302.    The  ITT  population  in  studies  CL-101,  CL-303  and  CL-302 
consisted of patients with 2 copies of SMN2. A number of PCR-based copy number assays have been 
validated to quantify SMN2 copy number in DNA samples from SMA patients. These methods are widely 
available  in  all  EU  member  states.  Available  techniques  can  reliably  determine  SMN2  copy  number, 
especially in patients with up to and including 3 copies of SMN2 5 6. 
No significant immune response was detected against SMN1, both at baseline and during the study. 
All patients developed antibodies against the AAV9 capsid.  
Subjects with anti-AAV9 titres > 1:50 were excluded from the study because of the possibility that high 
levels of anti-AAV9 antibodies in the subject prior to dosing might impair efficacy or result in adverse 
events. In study CL-101, one of sixteen screened patients were excluded due to a to high baseline AAV9 
antibody titre. Two patients in CL-304 and 5 patients in CL-302 failed screening due to presence of AAV9 
antibodies. Overall, 5.5% of patients screen failed due to antibody titer across the clinical program. This 
indicates that a AAV9 titre above 1:50 is not a major problem in clinical practice. This is supported by 
literature that reports low prevalence of AAV9 titres in children and young adults (6-10%). The available 
data do not suggest a major impact of AAV9 antibodies on safety and efficacy up to a titre level of 1:50. 
The upper border of the safe range remains undetermined. A warning in the SmPC is considered adequate 
to manage the possible risk of baseline AAV9 antibody titres.   
None of the patients returned to AAV9 Ab titres <1:50 at the end of the study, posing a problem for re-
treatment. For the moment, a re-treatment with Zolgensma should not be scheduled given the sustained 
anti-AAV9-antibodies after Zolgensma. This should also be reflected in the SmPC.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No dedicated PK and PD studies were conducted for Zolgensma. This is acceptable for a gene therapy 
product. Bio-distribution in humans is largely based on data from non-human primates and data from 
the deceased patients.  
Shedding of the virus occurs primarily via the faeces and the majority of the dose is cleared within 30 
days of dose administration.  
CMAP  and  MUNE  were  measured  as  pharmacodynamic  markers  in  study  CL-101.  Increases  in  these 
parameters were shown after Zolgensma treatment. The increases exceed what can be expected from 
natural history.  
No patients had baseline titres against SMN1 protein above the 1:50 limit, and there was no immune 
response against SMN1 after Zolgensma administration.  
An immune response was mounted, as expected, against the AAV9 capsid. This immune response was 
dampened  by  the  pre-treatment  with  prednisolone.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  formation  of  AAV9 
antibodies prevent efficacy or poses a safety risk, nor is there evidence that baseline AAV9 seropositivity 
will occur frequently in clinical practice. The applicant included a warning in the SmPC that efficacy and 
safety is not established in patients with baseline AAV9 antibody titres above 1:50.

The CHMP endorsed the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as 
described above.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose finding 
No specific dose response studies were conducted for Zolgensma. The justification of the Applicant of 
the therapeutic dose of 1.1E14 vg/kg (referred to as 2.0E14 vg/kg in study CL-101) is based on non-
clinical studies and on study CL-101. The doses selected for study CL-101 were based on the observed 
safety and demonstrated efficacy in multiple animal models (see section0). Three dose levels were pre-
planned (6.7E13 vg/kg, 2.0E14 vg/kg, and 3.3E14 vg/kg). The highest was never used as the second 
dose level exceeded expectations by motor milestone achievement never seen in the natural course of 
disease. This is also the dose selected for the pivotal study CL-303.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The  natural  history  studies  PNCR  and  NeuroNext  (see  section  below)  provide  the  information  of  the 
natural course of the disease. 
Study  CL-303  evaluating  process  B  manufactured  product  is  considered  the  pivotal  study  for  the 
assessment of efficacy in patients with 2 SMN2 copies. The pivotal study for the assessment of efficacy, 
at the time of initial submission was study CL-101 in which the product was manufactured using process 
A. Because - based on Quality assessment - comparability of process A and B cannot be concluded CL-
101 is now considered supportive. The process B product is investigated in study CL-302 and CL-304 
also, which are still ongoing. Data from study CL-304 is used to support the use of Zolgensma in pre-
symptomatic patients with 2 or 3 SMN2 copies.  
Study CL-303 is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study of Zolgensma in patients with SMA 
Type 1 who were either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic with no functional SMN1 gene and 1 or 2 copies 
of SMN2 and who are < 6 months (< 180 days) of age at the time of gene replacement therapy (Day 
1).  As  of  the  31st  of  December  2019  cutoff,  the  study  has  been  completed.  The  final  study  report  is 
awaited and will be provided in September 2020. 
Since SMA patients have very limited motor skills, it is difficult to assess motor ability in these patients. 
The  CHOP-INTEND  (The  Children’s  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  Infant  Test  for  Neuromuscular  Disorders) 
score  is  a  sensitive  score  for  motor  function  ability  designed  and  validated  specifically  for  severely 
affected  SMA  patients.  The  patients  are  scored  on  16  items  (including  joint  flexion  and  extension, 
spontaneous movement and head control), ranging from 1-4 per item. This gives a total maximum score 
of  64.  The  CHOP-INTEND  score  represents  measures  of  disease  severity.  CHOP-INTEND  scores  are 
assessed in CL-101, CL-303, CL-304 cohort 1 and in CL-302.  
Paediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research Database (PNCR) 
The  PNCR  natural  history cohort,  consisting  of  all  patients  (n=23)  with  age  of  onset  ≤  6  months,  bi-
allelic deletion of SMN1 and 2 copies of SMN2 for whom enrolment data (retrospective and prospective) 
were  available  was  drawn 7 from  The  Paediatric  Neuromuscular  Clinical  Research  (PNCR)  database,  a 
natural history study of 337 patients with any form of SMA followed at 3 large, tertiary medical centres. 
Inclusion of the patients ranged from May 2005 to April 2009.  
The PCNR database also contains data on patients with 3 SMN2 copies, which were not included in the 
PCNR natural history cohort but are used for comparison in study CL-304.

Primary endpoints in the PNCR study were age at death and age at reaching the combined endpoint of 
either death or requiring at least 16 hours/day of non-invasive ventilation support for at least 14 days 
in the absence of an acute reversible illness or peri-operatively (as a surrogate for death). CHOP-INTEND 
scores and motor milestone achievement were obtained.  
NeuroNext study 
A population drawn from the NeuroNext natural history study (SMA type 1 patients with bi-allelic deletion 
of  SMN1  and  2  copies  of  SMN2  were  included  in  the  comparator  cohort  (n=16))  was  used  as  a 
supplementary control cohort for exploratory analyses in study CL-101. The NeuroNext natural history 
study was a longitudinal, multi-centre, prospective natural history study that enrolled 26 SMA infants <6 
months of age at 14 centres over 21 months within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke (NINDS) -sponsored NeuroNext Network8 between December 14, 2012 and September 10, 2014.  
Infant  motor  function  as  measured  by  CHOP-INTEND  was  assessed  and  CMAP  measurements  were 
obtained. Survival as defined in Study CL-101 was not captured in the NeuroNext study; survival within 
NeuroNext was defined as alive without tracheostomy.  
Results 
The  following  outcomes  from  the  PCNR  study  are  relevant  for  the  comparison  of  the  natural  history 
cohort to the patients in the clinical studies: 
Survival 
Sixteen (16) patients in the PNCR cohort reached the combined event (death or the need of non-invasive 
ventilation support). The patient-level survival rate of this control cohort determined at 13.6 months of 
age from the Kaplan-Meier curve is approximately 25%, this rate will be used as comparator with ITT 
population for survival analysis. The median survival is 10.5 months.  
When observed as a group, SMA type 1 patients with 3 copies of SMN2 experienced a less severe clinical 
course when compared with the population of patients with 2 copies of SMN2; 25th percentile for survival 
was 22 months with median survival not observed due to insufficient events. Most patients experienced 
prolonged survival with only 17% mortality during observation and an age range of between 15 months 
and 52 years (median 7.4 years).  
Motor Milestones 
None of the patients in the PNCR control cohort reached the milestone of sitting without support for ≥10 
seconds.  
A  proportion  of  patients  with  3  copies  of  SMN2  will  fail  to  gain  basic  milestones  such  as  independent 
sitting however the phenotypic variation of patients with 3 SMN2 copies is large.  
CHOP INTEND 
No  patient  achieved  a  CHOP  INTEND  score  >40  at  or  after  the  6-month  visit  (with  one  transient 
exception).  
The following outcomes from the NeuroNext study are relevant for the comparison of the natural history 
cohort to the patients in the clinical studies: 
The data for the NeuroNext cohort reflects tracheostomy-free survival, a more lenient endpoint (a child 
could receive 24 hours per day of non-invasive support without triggering the combined endpoint). The

percentage  reaching  the  survival  endpoint  at  14  months  of  age  is  therefore  slightly  lower  that  in  the 
PCNR cohort (62.5% of the patients versus 78.3% in the PNCR cohort).  
In the NeuroNext cohort, no child achieved the milestone of sitting with or without support, hands and 
knees crawling, standing with assistance, walking with assistance, standing alone or walking alone.  
In the NeuroNext cohort, no patient achieved a CHOP INTEND score >33 at or after the 6-month visit, 
and  no  patient  had  an  increase  in  score  from  baseline.  A  mean  decline  of  10.7  points  was  observed 
between the 6 and 12 months of age visit. 
Study CL-303 
This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study of Zolgensma that enrolled 22 patients with 
SMA Type 1 who were symptomatic with no functional SMN1 gene as well as 2 copies of SMN2 and who 
are  <  6  months  (<  180 days)  of  age  at  the  time  of  gene  replacement  therapy  (Day  1).  The  study  is 
completed  but  no  final  CSR  was  submitted  for  this  study  yet.  Results  of  the  requested  preliminary 
analysis (cut-off 31 DEC 2019) are presented.  
Methods 
• 
Study participants  
Main Inclusion criteria:  
1.  Patients with SMA Type 1 as determined by the following features: a. Diagnosis of SMA based 
on gene mutation analysis with bi-allelic SMN1 mutations (deletion or point mutations) and 1 or 
2 copies of SMN2 (inclusive of the known SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C).  
2.  The first three patients enrolled must meet the criteria for the Intent-To-Treat population (see 
statistical analysis section).  
3.  Patients must be < 6 months (< 180 days) of age at the time of Zolgensma infusion.  
4.  Patients  must  have  a  swallowing  evaluation  test  performed  prior  to  administration  of  gene 
replacement therapy. 
Main Exclusion criteria:  
1.  Previous, planned or expected scoliosis repair surgery/procedure during the study assessment 
period.  
2.  Pulse oximetry < 96% saturation at screening while the patient is awake or asleep without any 
supplemental  oxygen  or  respiratory  support,  or  for  altitudes  >  1000  m,  oxygen  saturation  < 
92% awake or asleep without any supplemental oxygen or respiratory support. Pulse oximetry 
saturation  may  decrease  to  <  96%  after  screening  provided  that  the  saturation  does  not 
decrease by ≥ 4 percentage points.  
3.  Tracheostomy or current use or requirement of non-invasive ventilatory support averaging ≥ 6 
hours/day over the 7 days prior to the screening visit; or ≥ 6 hours/day on average during the 
screening period or requiring ventilatory support while awake over the 7 days prior to screening 
or at any point during the screening period prior to dosing.   
4.  Patients  with  signs  of  aspiration/inability  to  tolerate  non-thickened  liquids  based  on  a  formal 
swallowing test performed as part of screening. Patients with a gastrostomy tube who pass the 
swallowing test will be allowed to enrol in the study.

Treatments 
Patients will receive a one-time dose intravenous of Zolgensma at 1.1 X 1014 vg/kg, equivalent to the 
dose received by Cohort 2 in the Phase 1 study.  
Patients were pre-treated with corticosteroids: 
• 
• 
• 
Pre-treatment with oral prednisolone should always be given 24 hours prior to infusion at a dose 
of 1 mg/kg/day 
Following 30 days of prednisolone treatment, the 1 mg/kg/day dose can be tapered over 4 weeks 
for patients whose alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values 
are  both  below 2 × upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  (e.g.,  2  weeks  at  0.5  mg/kg/day  and  then  2 
weeks at 0.25 mg/kg/day). 
If both the AST and ALT values remain > 2 × ULN after 30 days of prednisolone treatment, the 
1 mg/kg/day dose should be continued until the values return to normal range.  
• 
Objectives/ Endpoints 
Efficacy:  
Co-Primary  
•  Proportion of patients that achieve functional independent sitting for at least 30 seconds 
at  the  18  months  of  age  study  visit.  It  is  defined  by  the  Bayley  Scales  of  Infant  and 
Toddler Development (Version 3), confirmed by video recording, as a patient who sits 
up straight with head erect for at least 30 seconds.  
•  Survival at 14 months of age (see study CL-101).  
Co-Secondary  
•  The  proportion  of  patients  maintaining  the  ability  to  thrive,  defined  as  the  ability  to 
tolerate thin liquids (as demonstrated through a formal swallowing test) and to maintain 
weight  (>  third  percentile  based  on  World  Health  Organization  [WHO]  Child  Growth 
Standards for age and gender) without need of gastrostomy or other mechanical or non-
oral nutritional support at 18 months of age  
•  The  proportion  of  patients  who  are  independent  of  ventilatory  support,  defined  as 
requiring  no  daily  ventilator  support/usage  at  18  months  of  age,  excluding  acute 
reversible illness and perioperative ventilation, as defined above through assessment of 
actual usage data captured from the device (Phillips Trilogy)  
Exploratory  
•  Proportion of patients that achieves motor milestones (see CL-101):  the ability to hold 
head  erect  without  support,  roll  from  back  to  both  sides,    to  sit  with  support 
independently (> 10 seconds; WHO), ability to crawl, ability to pull to stand, ability to 
stand with assistance,  to stand alone, to walk with assistance, to walk alone  
•

Enrolling  up  to  twenty  (20)  patients  under  the  broader  enrolment  criteria  is  projected  to  enable 
enrolment of at least fifteen (15) patients that meet the Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) criteria. The 
ITT population is identified as symptomatic patients with bi-allelic SMN1 deletions and 2 copies of SMN2 
without the SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C) who meet all other study enrolment criteria. In 
addition,  the  first  three  patients  enrolled  must  meet  the  criteria  for  the  Intent-to-Treat  Population  to 
enable  a  comparison  of  CHOP-INTEND  scores  at  one-month  following  gene  replacement  therapy  to 
enable a comparison of patient response between CL-303 patients and Cohort 2 patient results from the 
Phase 1 trial (CL-101).

Results   
Participant flow  
As of the cut-off date of 31 DEC 2019, 22 patients were enrolled in Study 303.   
One  patient  was  discontinued  due  to  death  (caused  by  respiratory  distress  not  considered  related  to 
study drug) on Study Day 171 at the age of 7.8 months. One patient withdrew from the study and was 
alive but needed ventilation assistance (≥ 16 hours of non-invasive BiPAP ventilator support for ≥ 14 
consecutive days) at the EOT visit. One patient withdrew consent due to an AE just before the end of 
study visit at 18 months of age. Therefore 19 patients completed the study. All 22 patients met the ITT 
criteria, which are symptomatic patients with bi-allelic SMN1 deletions and 2 copies of SMN2 without the 
SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C) who receive an IV infusion of Zolgensma at < 180 days of 
age.

Table 10. Twelve female patients (54.5%) and 10 male patients (45.5%) were enrolled in the study 
and  received  an  infusion  of  Zolgensma.  Nineteen  of  these  patients  were  symptomatic  and  had 
homozygous  deletion  of  SMN1  and  2  copies  of  SMN2.  One  patient  was  asymptomatic  and  had 
homozygous deletion of SMN1 and 2 copies of SMN2 but was later re-classified as being symptomatic.

The age at baseline ranged from 0.5 to 5.9 months. Twenty (20) of 22 patients (90.9%) met the co-
primary endpoint of survival at 14 months of age. Thus, Zolgensma compares favorably to PNCR 
natural history where 25% were alive at 13.6 months. The co-primary endpoint survival was defined 
by either death or requiring permanent ventilatory support. The favorable 14 months of age survival 
data is substantiated by the co-secondary endpoint of ventilatory independence at 18 months of age: 
18 of 22 patients (81.8%) were independent of ventilatory support (as assessed by Trilogy BiPAP data, 
see section on non-invasive and ventilator support below).Thus, Zolgensma compares favourably to 
PNCR natural history where 25% survived at 13.6 months.

The co-primary endpoint of sitting independently for at least 30 seconds at 18 months of age was met 
by 13/22 patients (659).  
CHOP-INTEND scores 
CHOP-INTEND scores at 18 months of age (end of study visit) were available for 16/22 patients. One 
patient deceased and two discontinued prior to 18 months of age visit, while three patients had no CHOP-
INTEND examinations in line with the protocol due to prior three consecutive CHOP-INTEND scores ≥ 58. 
The mean total score (SD) was 51.2 (5.67) and the mean change from baseline (SD) was 19.3 (9.13).  
All  patients  showed  increase  in  CHOP-INTEND  score  from  baseline  during  the  study.  The  mean  (SD) 
increases  (improvement)  from  baseline  to  Month  1,  Month  3,  Month  6  and  Month  12  after  the 
administration  of  Zolgensma  were  6.9  (5.35),  11.7  (6.40),  14.6  (7.04)  and  16.4  (8.04)  points, 
respectively. 
Twenty-one patients (95.5%) achieved a CHOP-INTEND score of ≥40, 14 (63.6%) achieved a score of 
≥50 and 5 patients (22.7%) achieved a score ≥60 at any point of time in the study.

Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development  
The gross and fine motor subtests of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition 
(an assessment tool of developmental function in children between the ages of 1 to 42 months) were 
administered at baseline and then monthly beginning with Visit 6 in Study 303.  
The mean change from baseline to the highest post-baseline value was mean (SD) 23.9 (6.60) for the 
raw fine motor scale and 16.0 (9.19) for the raw gross motor scale. The raw scores are presented in 
(Figure  6)  Scaled  scores  over  time  were  also  evaluated  in  Study  CL-303.    The  scaled  score  reflects 
performance according to age as compared with other, normally developing children of the same age.  
The mean score is 10, with standard deviation of ± 3 points; thus, approximately 97% of children tested 
will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. In the gross motor subtest patients in CL303 had a 
mean (SD) baseline scaled score of 2.3 (2.55).  The mean gross motor scaled score remained effectively 
unchanged through 18 Months (End of study), when the mean (SD) was 1.3 (1.41).  In the fine motor 
subtest patients had mean (SD) scaled score of 6.4 (2.90) at baseline, and this also remained effectively 
unchanged  through  18  Months  (end  of  study)  when  the  mean  (SD)  was  7.7  (3.16).    Therefore,  on 
average Study CL-303 patients displayed gross motor function that was significantly lower than in same-
age peers, but tracking developmental gains.  Fine motor function was largely similar (within 2 SD) to 
same-age peers. 
The cognitive and expressive communication domains were also assessed within study CL-303 but no 
analysis of these domains is submitted.

Non-invasive and Invasive Ventilatory Support and Normal Feeding Support 
18 of 22 patients (81.8%) were independent of ventilatory support (as assessed by Trilogy BiPAP data) 
at 18 months of age (co-secondary endpoint, p< 0.0001). Four patients did not achieve independence 
of ventilatory support (as assessed by Trilogy BiPAP data) at 18 months of age. Two (2) patients had 
Trilogy data at or after 18 months of age and two patients withdrew from the study prior to 18 months 
of age. In total, 15 of 22 patients (68.1%) did not require any non-invasive ventilatory support at any 
point during the study.  
Fifteen (15) of 22 patients (68.1%) received no non-oral feeding support at any time during the study. 
Seven patients (31.8%) received non-oral feeding support at some point during the study.  Of these, 
four patients had intermittent or transient feeding support during the study and were not receiving non-
oral feeding support at the end of the study. A total of 19 of 22 patients (86.3%) were feeding without 
mechanical support at the end of the study (or early termination). Two (2) patients had G-tube placement 
and were receiving feeding support at the end of the study or withdrawal from the study. One (1) patient 
discontinued prematurely from the study and feeding support was ongoing at the time of withdrawal.

The ability to thrive at 18 months of age was a co-secondary endpoint defined as the ability to tolerate 
thin liquids, does not receive nutrition through mechanical support, and maintains weight consistent with 
age. Nine of 22 patients (40.9%) met the ability to thrive criteria at 18 months of age (

Ancillary analyses 
Results by time interval of time of diagnosis to time of treatment 
The applicant has provided an additional analysis of the possible relationship between maximum CHOP 
INTEND score after treatment and the time interval between SMA diagnosis and treatment. No significant 
correlation  was  found  with  regression  analysis  in  study  CL-303.  However,  significant  methodological 
issues were identified. The applicant has committed to design a model predicting the expected treatment 
outcome post-marketing.  
2.5.3.  Supportive studies  
Study CL-101 is a Phase 1, open-label, single-infusion, ascending-dose, single-centre study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in up to 15 patients with Type 1 SMA. Primary endpoint was survival 
(time  from  birth  to  either  death  or  permanent  ventilation),  analysed  once  all  patients  reached13.6 
months  of  age.  The  most  relevant  secondary  endpoints  were  motor  milestone  achievement  and  the 
change from baseline CHOP-INTEND score.  
LT-001,  the  long-term  follow-up  study  of  study  CL-101  is  submitted  to  support  the  maintenance  of 
efficacy.  
Study CL-302 is an ongoing, Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, trial of Zolgensma in patients 
with a biallelic mutations of the SMN1 gene and with one or two copies of SMN2. Up to 30 patients < 6 
months (< 180 days) of age at the time of gene  replacement therapy (Day 1) were enrolled starting 
from Q2 2018. The study has been designed as the European counterpart of study CL-303. Nine European 
investigative sites in Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have currently enrolled patients for 
this study. 
Study CL-304 is an ongoing, global, Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, multicenter study of 
IV Zolgensma for the treatment of ≥ 44 pre-symptomatic newborn patients expected to develop Type 1, 
2, or 3 SMA with 2 (cohort 1), 3 (cohort 2), or 4 copies of SMN2 who are ≤ 6 weeks of age at the time 
of gene replacement therapy.  Patients with SMN1 point mutations or the SMN2 gene modifier mutation 
(c.859G>C) are not excluded.  
In  addition,  the  applicant  provided  information  on  extended  access  programs  and  managed  access 
programs existing in the United States and France, under which at least 51 patients up to the age of 29

Methods 
Main inclusion Criteria:  
Bi-allelic SMN1 gene mutations (deletion or point mutation) with 2 copies of SMN2 and excluding 
• 
the c.859G>C modification in exon 7   
• 
• 
Patients 6 months and younger with disease onset up to 6 months of age.  
Hypotonia  by  clinical  evaluation  with  delay  in  motor  skills,  poor  head  control,  round  shoulder 
posture, and hypermobility of joints.  
Main exclusion criteria:  
1.  Patients  with  antibody  to  adeno-associated  virus  serotype  9  (anti-AAV9)  titres  >1:50  as 
determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding immunoassay. 
2.  Patient with signs of aspiration based on a swallowing test and unwilling to use an alternative 
method to oral feeding.  
The study included 2 sequential dosing cohorts:  
•  Cohort 1 (low dose): 6.7E13 vg/kg (3 patients)  
•  Cohort 2: 2.0E14 vg/kg (12 patients)  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from birth to either  
1.  requirement  of  ≥16-hour  respiratory  assistance  per  day  (includes  bi-level  positive  airway 
pressure  [BiPAP])  continuously  for  ≥2  weeks  in  the  absence  of  an  acute  reversible  illness, 
excluding perioperative ventilation or  
2.  death.  
The key secondary endpoints that were evaluated included:  
• 
The  change  from  baseline  in  Children’s  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  Infant  Test  of  Neuromuscular 
Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score. The CHOP-INTEND is a physical therapy assessment designed 
and validated specifically for use with patients affected by SMA Type 19. If a patient achieved 2 
consecutive CHOP-INTEND scores ≥62, the PI, the physical therapist, and the Sponsor reviewed 
the patient status and determined whether or not continued CHOP-INTEND assessments were 
necessary, otherwise CHOP-INTEND assessments continued monthly during Year 1 and quarterly 
during  Year  2.  Children’s  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  Infant  Test  of  Neuromuscular  Disorders 
examinations were video recorded. 
•  Motor milestone achievement was determined by an external reviewer.  
Exploratory efficacy objectives presented to support the application: 
•  Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (Bayley Scales), a standardized, 
norm-referenced infant assessment. The gross and fine motor portions as well as speech and 
cognition portions of this test were administered in patients who achieved a score ≥60 of 64 on 
the CHOP-INTEND. The Bayley Scales are a standardized, norm-referenced infant assessment of 
developmental functioning across 5 domains: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and 
adaptive behaviour. The Bayley Scales are administered by a physical therapist. A scaled score 
of ≥8 on the Bayley Scales would be considered the low end of normal. Gross and fine motor

portions  were  to  be  completed  monthly  through  the  time  point  that  the  patient  reached  15 
months of age or 12 months post-dose, whichever was later. The language and cognition portions 
were to be administered every 3 months. 
•  Achievement  of  the  developmental  milestone  of  functional  independent  sitting  for  at  least  30 
seconds and developmental milestones of sitting unassisted for 15 seconds, 10 seconds, and 5 
seconds, respectively, for patients that did not achieve functional independent sitting for at least 
30 seconds.  
• 
• 
The proportion of patients who did not require non-oral nutrition prior to therapy who maintained 
the ability to thrive, defined by the ability to tolerate thin liquids (as demonstrated through a 
formal swallowing test), did not receive nutrition through mechanical support (ie, feeding tube), 
and maintained weight (>3rd percentile for age and gender) 
The proportion of patients who were independent of ventilatory support, defined as requiring no 
daily  ventilator  support/usage  in  the  absence  of  acute  reversible  illness  and  excluding 
perioperative ventilation.  
Statistical methods 
The CSR includes data from efficacy analyses conducted at the following time points: 
o  The  primary  efficacy  data  cut-off  (20Jan2017),  the  date  at  which  all  patients  had 
completed a study visit after reaching 13.6 months of age 
o  When  the  last  enrolled  patient  had  a  study  visit  after  reaching  20  months  of  age 
(07Aug2017) 
o  When all patients completed 24 months of post-dose follow-up (14Dec2017) 
The change from baseline in CHOP-INTEND score was analysed by using mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM). The model for the FAS included the change from baseline as the dependent variable, and fixed 
effects  of  Cohort  visit,  and  baseline  as  covariate,  and  interactions  of  cohort-visit,  baseline-visit.  An 
unstructured  (general)  covariance  structure  was  assumed  initially  to  model  the  within-patient  errors; 
however,  if  unstructured  covariance  resulted  in  non-convergence,  the  variance  component  was  used. 
The  least  squares  means,  differences  between  least  squares  (LS)  means,  a  95%  2-sided  confidence 
limits for each difference and the p-values from model effects were reported for each scheduled visit. A 
post  hoc  analysis  of  Cohort  2  CHOP-INTEND  scores  using  intrinsic  factors  was  also  conducted  and 
reported separately. 
The number (%) of patients who exhibited evidence of milestone achievement based on external expert 
confirmation by the time of efficacy data cut-off was summarized by Cohort using the FAS. The observed 
proportion attaining these milestones was compared to zero (the expected rate of attainment amongst 
untreated patients with SMA Type 1) using a 1-sided exact binomial test. 
Results 
Of the 16 patients who were screened for the study, 1 failed screening (due to exclusionary baseline 
AAV9 antibody titre) and 15 were enrolled and treated (3 in Cohort 1, 12 in Cohort 2).  
None of the 15 treated patients discontinued from the study.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Survival without permanent ventilation  
Primary data cut-off: 13.6 months of age  
All 15 patients (100%) survived without permanent ventilation through 13.6 months of age. Results in 
the ITT analysis set are provided in Table 16 
Compared with the natural history estimate of 25%, all Zolgensma-treated patients had statistically 
significant improved survival without permanent ventilation.

At 24 months of follow-up post-dose, the end-of-study assessment, all patients were alive and all but 
one patient was free of permanent ventilation. Compared with the historical survival rate, the survival 
rates for patients treated with Zolgensma were statistically significantly higher for both cohorts and for 
all patients combined.  
Secondary endpoint: change from baseline in CHOP-INTEND score 
illustrates the change in CHOP-INTEND score over time by patient and by cohort at the final study date 
cutoff  (24  months  post-dose).  All  patients  (100%)  achieved  improvement  of  at  least  4  points  from 
baseline function.   
At Months 1 and 3, patients in Cohort 2 had mean increases from baseline of 9.8 and 15.4, respectively 
(n=12, both p<0.001), while patients in Cohort 1 had a mean increase of 0.3 at Month 1 and a decrease 
of -0.3 at Month 3 (both n=3, both p≥0.817).  
The mean increase from baseline was 25.4 in cohort 2. In the analysis of the FAS, the mean change 
from baseline in Cohort 2 was statistically significant from baseline from Month 1 through Month 19 (all 
p<0.001).  
Scores  for  patients  in  Cohort  2  increased  rapidly  after  Zolgensma  administration,  were  greater  than 
those observed in Cohort 1, and were sustained over time.  
When comparing the 2 cohorts, the overall LS mean difference in the change from baseline was 23.22 
(95% CI, 20.36, 26.07, p<0.001) favouring Cohort 2. Improvement from baseline in Cohort 2 patients 
was significantly greater compared with Cohort 1 from Month 1 through Month 19 (all p≤0.026). 
Eleven of 12 Cohort 2 patients achieved CHOP-INTEND scores ≥40, 10/11 patients achieved scores ≥50, 
and  3/11  patients  achieved  scores  ≥60  during  the  study  (all  1-sided  p<0.001  vs  zero  in  the  natural 
history cohort).

 a Patients are included in multiple categories for the “sits without support” milestone, including patients who are 
observed sitting alone for ≥ 5, ≥ 10, ≥ 15, or ≥ 30 seconds. Patients sitting ≥ 30 seconds are included in the totals 
for ≥ 15 seconds, ≥ 10 seconds, and ≥ 5 seconds (WHO definition).

Maintaining Ability to Thrive  
The ability to thrive ITT analysis set included 7 patients from cohort 2 with bi-allelic deletion of SMN1 
and a baseline CHOP-INTEND score ≥20 at baseline and who did not require non-oral nutrition prior to 
administration of Zolgensma. Six of 7 patients (85.7%) maintained the ability to thrive at the 14 months 
of  age  study  visit  defined  by  the  ability  to  tolerate  thin  liquids  (as  demonstrated  through  a  formal 
swallowing test), did not receive nutrition through mechanical support (ie, feeding tube), and maintained 
weight (>3rd percentile for age and gender). At the 24 months post-dose study visit, 5 out of 7 patients 
maintained the ability to thrive (Table 19).

Pulmonary and Nutritional Achievements  
Ten  patients  in  cohort  2  were  free  of  non-invasive  ventilatory  support  (NIV)  at  baseline.    During  the 
course of the study, all patients in cohort 1 and 6 patients in cohort 2 were using NIV. The average hours 
per  day  was  fairly  stable,  expect  for  some  transient  increases  during  illnesses  and  respiratory  tract 
infections.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 85/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Nearly all patients experienced respiratory illnesses that, in children with Type 1 SMA, typically result in 
tracheostomy or death. All but one patient in Study CL-101 survived respiratory hospitalisations without 
tracheostomy or the need for permanent ventilation 
In Cohort 2, 7 patients did not receive enteral feeding prior to gene replacement therapy. One (1) of 
these 7 patients had short period of nutritional support post-gene-replacement therapy to assist wound 
healing surgery. Four of the 5 patients in Cohort 2 who received enteral feeding prior to gene replacement 
therapy could feed orally at end-of-study; thus, a total of 11 of the 12 patients in Cohort 2 were able to 
feed orally.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup  assessments  on  change  from  baseline  for  CHOP-INTEND  score  were  done  for  age,  weight, 
baseline CHOP-INTEND score, and gender using Cohort 2 (which received the proposed therapeutic dose) 
from Study CL-101 to assess whether factors could be identified that predict which patients will benefit 
most  from  treatment.  These  analyses were  not  predefined  and  therefore  not  included  in  the  SAP.  No 
rationale  is  provided  for  this  subgroup  definition  and  this  subgroup  definition  is  not  in  line  with  the 
efficacy subgroup definition provided by the applicant somewhere else. 
The following subgroups were formed: 
Gender 
Female (n=7) 
Male (n=5) 
Age at time of dosing 
< 3.1 months (n=6) 
≥ 3.1 months (n=6)

< 5.45 kg (n=6) 
≥ 5.45 kg (n=6) 
baseline CHOP-INTEND scores 
< 29 (n=5) 
≥ 29 (n=7) 
Results by Age/weight at Dosing  
Since  age  and  weight  at  dosing  were  correlated,  the  results  from  these  two  post  hoc  analyses  are 
combined.  Improvement  from  baseline  in  CHOP-INTEND  scores  was  somewhat  greater,  particularly 
across earlier time points, for the younger patient subgroup, i.e. < 3.1 months of age. At 3 months post-
dose, younger patients improved 19.3 ± 5.6 points (mean, standard deviation, LOCF), whereas older 
patients improved 11.5 ± 4.5 points. By end-of-study (24 months of follow-up post-dose), improvements 
in CHOP-INTEND scores were more similar between the 2 subgroups, 25.1 ± 10.3 points for the younger 
subgroup and 24.0 ± 10.1 points for the older subgroup ( 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 86/150 
 
 
  
  
 
Table  20).  The  CHOP-INTEND  scores  were  improved  from  baseline  (nominal  P  <  0.05  by  post-hoc 
statistical testing) for both subgroups at all time-points.  
Of the 9 patients in Cohort 2 who achieved functional independent sitting for ≥ 30 seconds within 24 
months of follow-up post-dose, 6 were ≤ 3 months of age and 3 were between 3 and 6 months of age 
at the time of Zolgensma administration.

c Patient 11 had early corrective surgery for congenital scoliosis which impacted the ability to sit independently.  
Results by Baseline CHOP-INTEND Score  
Since the CHOP-INTEND scale has a maximum score of 64, improvement from baseline in CHOP-INTEND 
scores  was  numerically  greater  in  patients  with  lower  CHOP-INTEND  scores  at  baseline  but  showed 
substantial overlap with scores in patients with higher baseline CHOP-INTEND scores. At 3 months post-
dose,  the  patients  with  lower  baseline  CHOP-INTEND  scores  improved  15.8  ±  10.0  points  (mean, 
standard deviation, LOCF) while patients with higher CHOP-INTEND scores at baseline improved 15.1 ± 
2.7 points. By end-of-study (24 months of follow-up post-dose), improvement in CHOP-INTEND scores 
in  patients  with  lower  CHOP-INTEND  scores  at  baseline  was  27.0  ±  13.6  points  and  was  22.9  ±  6.6 
points in patients with higher CHOP-INTEND scores at baseline.  
Results by Gender  
Mean CHOP-INTEND scores for the 2 gender subgroups were similar at baseline (males 28.4, females 
28.0). Improvement in baseline CHOP-INTEND scores was numerically greater in males than in females 
but showed substantial overlap between the two groups. By the end of the study (24 months of follow-
up  post-dose),  male  patients  improved  22.3  ±  10.5  points  and  female  patients  improved  27.8  ±  8.7 
points. The CHOP-INTEND scores were improved from baseline (nominal P < 0.05 by post-hoc statistical 
testing) for both subgroups at all time points.   
Results by time interval of time of birth to time of treatment 
The applicant has provided an additional analysis of the possible relationship between maximum CHOP 
INTEND score after treatment and the time between birth and treatment. The results of this analysis 
suggest  that  time  between  birth  and  Zolgensma  treatment  has  a  significantly  linear  effect  on  the 
maximum CHOP-INTEND total score achieved (p=0.0142).

2.5.3.2.  Study LT-001 
Study LT-001 is an ongoing, observational, long-term, safety follow-up study of patients who completed 
Study 101. Of the 15 patients from study CL-101, 13 patients were enrolled in study LT-001 (3 from 
cohort 1 and 10 from cohort 2). The study consists of an initial 5-year phase, during which patients are 
being seen annually for evaluation of long-term safety, followed by a 10-year observational phase with 
annual telephone contacts.  
The primary objective is to collect long-term safety data of patients with Type 1 SMA who were treated 
with Zolgensma in the CL-101 gene replacement therapy clinical trial. 
An efficacy objective was included to determine whether the highest achieved milestone in Study CL-
101 was maintained. 
Motor milestones will be recorded at study initiation and at the annual study visits during the initial 5-
year follow up according to the following checklist and will be supported by video documentation:

As of 31 DEC 2019, 13 patients had enrolled in Study LT-001 and had a baseline visit. Eleven patients 
had completed a 1-year post-baseline visit and 7 patients a 2-year post-baseline visit  
Nusinersen is documented as having been used by 7 of the 13 enrolled patients (53.8%) at the 1-year 
visit. Thus, 3 of the 3 patients (100%) enrolled in Cohort 1 treated with the low dose of Zolgensma have 
been started on nusinersen and this is reported as ongoing (Study LT-101). Four of 10 patients (40.0%) 
who  received  the  higher  dose  in  Cohort  2  and  who  enrolled  in  Study  LT-001  have  been  started  on 
nusinersen.  Nusinersen  use  is  reported  as  ongoing  for  all  patients.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  nusinersen 
treatment was started on parental request to see if the children could achieve additional benefit from 
combination therapy. The limited dataset does not allow conclusions on additional benefit of nusinersen 
in Study LT-001 or lack thereof.  
All  13  (100%) of  the  patients  who  enrolled  in  Study  LT-001  were  surviving  (alive  without  permanent 
ventilation) as of 31 DEC 2019. All of the 10 higher-dose Cohort 2 patients (100%) enrolled in Study LT-
001 have remained free of permanent ventilation. Two of the 3 patients (66.7%) in the lower dose Cohort 
1 remain free of permanent ventilation. Five of the 10 enrolled Cohort 2 patients (50.0%) require no 
respiratory support and one Cohort 2 patient (33.3%) requires respiratory support only when ill. Thus, 
6 of 10 enrolled higher-dose Cohort 2 patients (60.0%) require no regular, daily respiratory support. 
New  video-confirmed  motor  milestones  were  achieved  by  2  patients:  stands  with  assistance.  Both  of 
these patients have had a one-year follow-up visit and neither of these patients are reported to have 
used nusinersen.

Study CL-302 
Study CL-302 is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, trial of Zolgensma (gene replacement 
therapy) in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 who meet enrolment criteria and are 
genetically defined by a biallelic mutation in SMN1 gene and with one or two copies of SMN2. Up to 30 
patients  <  6  months  (<  180  days)  of  age  at  the  time  of  gene  replacement  therapy  (Day  1)  will  be 
enrolled starting from Q2 2018. The study has been designed as the European counterpart of study CL-
303. Nine European investigative sites in Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have currently 
enrolled patients in this study. 
Objectives:  
Primary 
•  Determine  efficacy  by  demonstrating  achievement  of  developmental  milestone  of  sitting  without 
support for 10 seconds up to 18 months of age as defined by WHO Motor Developmental Milestones. 
Secondary 
•  Determine  efficacy  based  on  survival  at  14  months  of  age.  Survival  is  defined  by  the  avoidance  of 
combined endpoint of either (a) death or (b) permanent ventilation which is defined by tracheostomy or 
by the requirement of ≥ 16 hours of respiratory assistance per day (via non-invasive ventilatory support) 
for  ≥  14  consecutive  days  in  the  absence  of  an  acute  reversible  illness,  excluding  perioperative 
ventilation. Permanent ventilation, so defined, is considered a surrogate for death. 
Exploratory 
• Achievement of motor milestones, CHOP-INTEND scores and Bayley’s scale scores are amongst the 
exploratory endpoints of this study.  
Results 
Survival  
At data cut, 32 of the 33 enrolled patients (93.6%) had had survived without permanent ventilation of 
which only 18 patients (56.3%) were ≥ 14 months of age and 4 (12.5%) were ≥ 18 months of age.

Motor milestone achievement 
As shown in Table 21, as of the 31 Dec 2019 data cut-off, 8 patients met the milestone (Bayley Scales 
Gross Motor Subset item #26), “sitting alone without support for at least 30  seconds” (Bayley scales 
gross  motor  subset  item  #26),  which  constitutes  functional  independent  sitting.  The  primary  efficacy 
endpoint “independent sitting for at least 10 seconds at any time up to 18 months of age (WHO definition) 
was met by 6 of the 32 patients (18.8%)

CHOP-INTEND 
Mean baseline CHOP-INTEND score was 27.5 (range 14, 55) with a median of 27.5. Thus, baseline CHOP-
INTEND scores in CL-302 study patients were lower compared to CL-303 study patients.  
The  mean increases  (improvement)  from  baseline  to  Month  1  (n=31),  Month  3  (n=29),  and  Month 6 
(n=27) after dosing were 5.9 (5.48), 10.1 (6.32), and 13.3 (6.54) points, respectively.  
At of the 31 Dec 2019 data cut-off, 21 patients (63.6%) had scored ≥ 40 on the CHOP INTEND, and 12 
patients (36.4%) had scored ≥ 50 and 1 patients had scored ≥60.  
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 
As of the 31 Dec 2019 data cut-off 30 patients (93.8%) had ≥ 3 months of Bayley Scales data (range of 
1 to 15 months of data). Improvement in performance was observed in both the Bayley Scales gross 
motor and fine motor subsets raw scores. In the gross motor subtest patients improved their mean (SD) 
raw score by 6.0 (7.16) points at Month 6 post-dose (n = 29), and by 9.6 (6.64) points at Month 12 
(n=16). In the fine motor subtest patients improved their mean (SD) raw score by 19.2 (5.79) points at 
Month 6 post-dose (n = 29), and by 22.1 (4.18) points at Month 12 (n=16).  
Study CL-304 
Study CL-304 is an ongoing multi-centre, global, Phase III, open label, single arm study to assess the 
Safety and Efficacy of a single IV infusion of 1.1E14 vg/kg (equivalent to therapeutic dose cohort 2 CL-
101).  The  target  patient  population  is  pre-symptomatic  patients  expected  to  develop  SMA,  bi-allelic 
deletion of SMN1 and 2,3 or 4 copies of SMN2 without the genetic modifier (c.895G>C) (ITT population). 
Patient with genetic modifier of SMN1 point mutations are not excluded.  
The protocol for Study CL-304 was modified in September 2018 after results of Good Laboratory Practice 
compliant 3-month mouse toxicology studies became available. As a result of these toxicology findings 
(arterial thrombosis), AveXis suspended enrolment of pre-symptomatic patients with 4 copies of SMN2 
in Study CL304. No patients with 4 copies of SMN2 had been enrolled in Study 304 at the time of this 
protocol amendment by purpose, but one patient enrolled into cohort 2 was found to have four copies 
of SMN2. Therefore, cohort 3 includes one patient. 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 91/150 
 
 
  
  
 
Study 304 will enrol ≥ 27 patients, including at least 15 patients with 2 copies of SMN2 who meet the 
ITT criteria, and at least 12 patients with 3 copies of SMN2 who meet the ITT criteria. Patients with SMN1 
point mutations or the SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C) may be enrolled but will not be included 
in the efficacy analysis sets. 
The endpoints per cohort are: 
Cohort 1 (2 SMN2 copies): proportion of patients achieving milestone of independent sitting for at least 
30 seconds at any visit up to 18 months of age.  
Cohort 2 (3 SMN2 copies): proportion of patients achieving the ability to stand without support for at 
least 3 seconds at any visit up to 24 months of age.  
Results 
As of the 31 DEC 2019 data cut-off, 14 patients were enrolled and treated in Study 304 within cohort 1 
(2 SMN2 copies). Fifteen (15) patients were enrolled and treated in cohort 2.  
Survival 
As of the efficacy data cut-off date of 31 DEC 2019, patients in cohort 1 had been in the study for an 
average  of  10.5  months  (range:  5.1-18  months).  Patients  in  cohort  2  had  been  in  the  study  for  an 
average  of  8.74  months  (range:  2-13.9  months).  All  patients  in  the  study  were  alive  and  free  of 
permanent ventilation at the data cut-off.

In the gross motor subtest, 2-copy SMN2 patients improved their mean (SD) raw score by 0.9 (1.94) 
points at Month 1 post-dose (n = 14), by 16.6 (4.37) points at Month 6 (n=8), by 29.3 (10.84) points 
at Month 12 (n = 4), and by 33.5 (9.40) points at Month 15 (n = 4); In the fine motor subtest, 2-copy 
SMN2 patients improved their mean (SD) raw score by 1.5 (2.18) points at Month 1 post-dose (n = 13), 
by 16.4 (2.50) points at  Month 6 (n = 8) , by 27.3 (2.63) at Month 12 (n=4) and by 30.5 (0.58) at 
Month 15 (n=4) Figure 10.  
The  scaled  score  reflects performance  according  to age  as  compared  with other,  normally  developing 
children  of  the  same  age.  The  mean  score  is  10,  with  standard  deviation  of  ±  3  points;  thus, 
approximately 97% of children tested will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (scores 4-16).  
In  the  2-copy  SMN2  cohort,  7  patients  (of  14;  50%)  have  Bayley  gross  motor  subtest  scaled  scores 
within 2 SD of the mean for age (i.e., scaled score ≥ 4) at their most recent visit prior to the data cutoff. 
All (14 of 14; 100%) patients in the 2-copy SMN2 cohort have Bayley fine motor scaled scores within 2 
SD of the mean for age.

In cohort 2 (3 SMN2 copies) all patients (100%) had at least 2 months of Bayley Scales data (range of 
1 to 14 months of data). In the fine motor subtest, 3-copy SMN2 patients improved their mean (SD) raw 
score by 1.6 (1.94) points at Month 1 post-dose (n = 13), by 16.5 (2.81) points at Month 6 (n=6), and 
by 24.3 (3.59) at Month 11 (n=4).  In the gross motor subtest, 3-copy SMN2 patients improved their 
mean (SD) raw score by 2.6 (2.26) points at Month 1 post-dose (n = 13), by 17.5 (4.42) points at Month 
6 (n=6), and by 32.0 (2.31) at Month 11 (n=4).  
All 15 patients have Bayley gross motor subtest scaled scores within 2 SD of the mean for age at their 
most recent visit prior to the data cut-off. Fourteen (14; of 15; 93.3%) patients in the 3-copy SMN2 
cohort have Bayley fine motor scaled scores within 2 SD of the mean for age at their most recent visit 
prior to the 31 Dec 2019 data cut-off.

Copies of SMN2 (cohort 2, 31 DEC 2019 Data Cut-off) 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
As of the 31 Dec 2019, a total of 81 patients with 2 copies of SMN2 have received Zolgensma in the 
above listed trials, referred to as “the 2-copy SMN2 pool”. The mean (±SD) follow-up time (time since 
receipt of Zolgensma) was 14.21 (±5.48) months, with a range of 1.8 to 25.7 months.  
EMA/200482/2020

Kaplan-Meier  analysis  of  survival  data  was  performed  for  the  2-copy  SMN2  pool  versus  historical, 
untreated controls from the NeuroNEXT and PNCR studies. The survival curve of the 2-copy SMN2 pool 
was statistically significantly different from the curves generated from the two historical control studies 
(log-rank test, P<0.0001; Figure 12). Therefore, the survival of 2-copy SMN2 individuals from Zolgensma 
studies is superior to the survival of historical, untreated controls.   
Figure 12: Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves of 2-Copy SMN2 Pool, NeuroNEXT, and PNCR Data 
Next,  developmental  milestone  achievement  was  assessed  for  the  2-copy  SMN2  pool,  and  the  total 
number of Zolgensma-treated individuals who achieved each developmental milestone at least once was 
tabulated. Not all milestones were assessed in all studies, but all milestones assessed were confirmed 
by central video review. The Bayley Scales milestones achieved by the largest to smallest proportion of 
the 2-copy SMN2 pool are:  head control (58 of 81; 71.6% achieved), sits without support (39 of 81; 
48.1% achieved), rolls from back to sides (38 of 81; 46.9% achieved), stands with assistance (7 of 69; 
10.1%),  walks  with  assistance  (8  f  81;  9.9%),  stands  alone  (7  of  81;  8.6%),  walks  alone  (5  of  81, 
6.2%), pulls to stand (4 of 69; 5.8%), and crawls (3 of 69; 4.3%). The WHO milestones achieved by the 
largest to smallest proportion of the 2-copy SMN2 pool are: sitting without support (34 of 81; 42%), 
standing with assistance (7 of 81; 8.6%), walking alone (4 of 69; 5.8%), walking with assistance (4 of 
69; 5.8%), and standing alone and hands-and-knees crawling (both 3 of 69; 4.3%).  
CHOP-INTEND scores in the 2-copy SMN2 pool rapidly improved (Figure 13) by a mean (±SD) of +6.5 
(±5.91) at 1 month post-dose, +11.8 (±6.93) at 3 months post-dose, +15.4 (±8.14) at 6 months post-
dose, and +19.9 (±8.54) at 12 months post-dose. The mean (±SD) CHOP-INTEND score at the most 
recent visit prior to the data cutoff was 49.8 (±10.54) for the 2-copy SMN2 pool participants.

Ventilator use was monitored in the 2-copy SMN2 pooled studies. Overall, 11 of 81 (13.5%) of 2-copy 
SMN2 patients required ventilator support at baseline. Ten of these patients also used ventilator support 
during the study. There were another 23 patients who did not need ventilator support at baseline, but 
who eventually used ventilator support during the study. Therefore, a total of 33 of 81 (40.7%) patients 
used ventilator support during the study.  A total of 48 of 81 (59.3%) 2-copy SMN2 patients remained 
free of ventilator support during the studies.  
Feeding support was monitored in the 2-copy SMN2 pooled studies, also. Nineteen (19) of 81 patients 
(23.5%) used feeding support during the study. This included 15 patients who had feeding support at 
baseline.  Of  the  remaining  66  patients,  11  (16.7%)  needed  feeding  support  during  the  study  after 
receiving Zolgensma. A total of 62 of 81 (76.5%) 2-copy SMN2 patients remained free of feeding support 
during the studies.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies were conducted in special populations. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In the dossier, 6 studies are included (CL-101, LT-001, CL-303, CL-302 and CL-304, and one patient 
from study CL-306) in support of the indication 5q SMA with up to 3 copies of SMN2.   
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 96/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
CL-303 is considered pivotal for the use of the product in symptomatic patients with 5q SMA and 2 SMN2 
copies. 
The preliminary data from CL-302 and CL-304 is considered supportive for the use of the product in 5q 
SMA patients 2 copies of SMN2 (CL-302) and for the use of Zolgensma in pre-symptomatic patients with 
2 or 3 SMN2 copies (CL-304).  
Study  CL-306  is  a  phase  3  trial  investigating  Zolgensma  in  5q  SMA  Type  1  patients  in  Japan,  South 
Korea, and Taiwan. So far, only one patient has been enrolled and treated. This study is not discussed 
here.  
Data from the ongoing study CL-102 was included in the dossier, but the efficacy is not discussed either 
as  it  is  an  ongoing  study  to  investigate  the  intrathecal  route  of  administration  in  sitting  but  non-
ambulatory patients (presumed SMA Type 2). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
As  of  31  Dec  2019    the  clinical  program  (including  CL-101  cohort  2,  CL-302  and  CL-303  and  CL-304 
cohort 1 and 2) includes 98 subjects treated with the proposed IV dose I, i.e. 12 in cohort 2 of CL-101 
(process A), 22 in CL-303, 33 in CL-302 and 30 in CL-304.  
Considering  only  process  B,  the  sample  size  is  86  for  which  efficacy  data  has  been  provided.  This  is 
substantial given the incidence of the disease, however, more information both in number of patients as 
in  follow-up  time  is  necessary  to  assess  the  maintenance  of  the  treatment  and  to  assess  the  clinical 
relevance  of  the  observed  effects  (especially  related  to  milestones  achievement).  This  data  will  be 
obtained from the long term follow up studies LT-001 and LT-002 and the RESTORE registry study. 
Dose finding 
No  dedicated  dose  finding/  dose  response  studies  were  conducted  for  Zolgensma.  Justification  of  the 
proposed therapeutic dose of 1.1E14 vg/kg is based on the non-clinical studies and a single ascending 
dose study i.e. study CL-101.  
Main study: Study CL-303 
This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study of Zolgensma (gene replacement therapy) 
that enrolled 22 patients with SMA Type 1  who were either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic with no 
functional SMN1 gene as well as 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 and who are < 6 months (< 180 days) of age at 
the time of gene replacement therapy.  
The study population is supportive of part of the proposed indication (patients with 2 SMN2 copies). The 
definition of SMA type 1 patients is in accordance with international consensus guidelines10.  
Co-Primary  endpoints  are  survival  at  14  months  of  age  and  the  proportion  of  patients  that  achieve 
functional independent sitting for at least 30 seconds at the 18 months of age study visit. This is a widely 
recognized  and  clinically  meaningful  endpoint  which  has  been  agreed  on  in  scientific  advice/protocol 
assistance for Zolgensma. 
The medicinal product used in this study was manufactured by process B.  
In  general  the  historical  controls  are  considered  adequate  for  comparison  with  the  study  population. 
Although there are indications that the patients in the PNCR cohort has less severe disease (as expressed 
by the older age of the included patients), this is not considered a major issue since the potential bias 
this  creates  i.e.  these  patients  are  expected  to  experience  the  event  earlier,  is  not  in  favour  of

Zolgensma.  ‘Ventilatory  requirement  prior  to  6  months  of  age’  is  considered  the  most  meaningful 
characteristic, as 21/23 of the PNCR and 22/22 of the CL-303 cohort did not require ventilator support 
prior to 6 months of age. Therefore, ventilator requirements prior to 6 months of age are considered of 
relevance for contextualisation of the ventilator requirements for determination of ‘survival’ in study CL-
303.  
Based on the literature available it can be concluded that few if any patients suffering from SMA type 1 
survive the first 18 months of life without any ventilatory requirement and nutritional support. Further 
it can be concluded that few (effectively zero) patients suffering from SMA type 1 would be expected to 
be able to effectively swallow safely and maintain weight within normal growth parameters absent the 
provision of mechanical nutrition support through 18 months of age.  
Supportive studies: 
Study CL-101  
Study  Zolgensma-CL-101  was  a  Phase  1,  non-randomised,  open  label,  uncontrolled,  single-centre, 
single-infusion,  ascending-dose,  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Zolgensma  in  up  to  15 
patients with Type 1 SMA. Outcomes were compared to the expected outcomes based on the two natural 
history cohorts derived from the PCNR and NeuroNext studies with respect to sex, race, ethnicity and 
CHOP-INTEND score.  
SMA type 1 patients were included in this clinical study, defined by a bi-allelic mutation/deletion of SMN1 
and 2 copies of SMN2, together with an age of disease onset ≤6 months and clinical signs of hypotonia.   
Patients were treated in two dose cohorts; a low dose of 6.7E13 vg/kg (cohort 1) and a higher dose of 
2.0E14 vg/kg (cohort 2). The medicinal product used in this study was manufactured by process A.  
The primary endpoint in this study was survival at 13.6 months of age, defined as time from birth to 
either death or permanent (≥16 hours per day) ventilatory support.   
Key secondary endpoints were change from baseline in CHOP-INTEND score and motor milestone. The 
CHOP-INTEND score is a validated motor function score for SMA type 1 children. Although this score is 
considered clinically meaningful, this is not a norm-referenced scale which hampers the assessment of 
the development in relation to their healthy peers. Bayley scale assessments were initiated in patients 
reaching the top of the CHOP-INTEND. Since this is a norm-referenced scale this outcome is expected to 
provide clinically meaningful information.  
Exploratory endpoints included maintaining the ability to thrive and the proportion of patients who were 
independent of ventilatory support.  
Efficacy analyses were conducted at 3 time points, the first two time points corresponded with those of 
the major efficacy endpoints of the natural history study (13.6 and 20 months of age), and the third 
time point corresponded with at least two years follow up for all patients (24 months post-dose). The 
efficacy endpoint of time to death or permanent ventilation was compared to the natural history estimate 
using a 1-sample binomial test at the time patients were 13.6 or 20 months of age (corresponding to 
25% and 8% survival in the natural history study.  
The change from baseline in CHOP-INTEND score was analysed using MMRM. This is an efficient analysis 
in a small study population with multiple measurements per patients.  
Study LT-001  
Maintenance of efficacy is assessed annually in this study by using developmental milestones, overall 
survival,  and  the  requirement  for  ventilation  support  are  specifically  assessed  annually.  Although 
important mile stones of motor development are captured (WHO score), this is not considered sufficient 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 98/150 
 
 
  
  
to address long term efficacy. Bayley scale assessments has been included in the long-term follow up 
studies.  This  information  provides  some  insight  in  the  full  development  of  the  growing  child  and  is 
necessary to make an informed decision at the time of treatment. 
Study CL-302 
This study has been designed as the European counterpart for study CL-303. Enrolment criteria were 
less strict with regard to ventilatory support use allowing slightly worse patients to be included.  
Achieving the motor milestone of independent sitting according to WHO criteria up to 18 months of age 
is reflected in the primary endpoint, while event-free survival is reflected in the key secondary endpoint. 
The study population is supportive for part of the proposed indication, namely symptomatic patients with 
2 SMN2 copies. 
The medicinal product used for this study was manufactured by process B. 
Study CL-304 
Study CL-304 is a phase III, open-label, single arm study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
Zolgensma in pre-symptomatic patients with 2 (cohort 1), 3 (cohort 2) or 4 (cohort 3) copies of SMN2.  
The study population is supportive of part of the proposed indication (pre-symptomatic patients with 2 
or 3 SMN2 copies).  
The primary efficacy endpoint for cohort 1 is: Proportion of patients achieving the development milestone 
of functional independent sitting at any visit up to 18 months of age.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for cohort 2 is: Proportion of patients achieving the ability to stand without 
support for at least 3 seconds at any visit up to 24 months of age.  
The medicinal product used in this study was manufactured by process B.  
Data  from  the  PCNR  is  used  to  construct  a  natural  history  for  both  patient  cohorts.  In  general,  the 
historical controls are considered adequate for comparison with the study population of cohort 2 (2 SMN2 
copies) since this group is relatively homogeneous. The natural history of patients with 3 SMN2 copies 
is very heterogeneous and more information from the available literature and the RESTORE registry is 
considered necessary to construct a reliable natural history for this patient population.  
The inclusion of patients with 4 SMN2 copies was stopped after dose related findings in the ventricles of 
the heart in a 3 month-long mouse toxicology study were reported. A No Adverse Effect Level was not 
identified for drug related heart findings in the mouse. Based on these findings it is considered justified 
that patients with mild disease (as patients with 4 copies of SMN2 generally are) are excluded. Although 
this is regrettable for no information will be readily available for the type 3b patient the exclusion of the 
patients with 4 SMN2 copies is considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study CL-303 
Twenty-six patients were screened in Study CL-303. Four patients (15.4%) failed screening and were 
not administered AVXS 101.  
Of the patients enrolled in study CL-303, 19 patients completed the study; one patient is deceased, and 
two patients withdrew consent.   
The available information supports that patients survive beyond the expected time (based on the natural 
history study). Due to the limited data and the heterogeneity of the observed responses, no prognostic 
factor  can  be  identified.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  the  development  of  a  prognostic  model  for 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 99/150 
 
 
  
  
expected treatment outcome taking into account data from all relevant patients and known covariant 
that might influence the treatment outcome.   
All  patients  showed  increase  in  CHOP-INTEND  score  from  baseline  during  the  study.  The  mean  (SD) 
increases  (improvement)  from  baseline  to  Month  1,  Month  3,  Month  6  and  Month  12  after  the 
administration  of  Zolgensma  were  6.9  (5.35),  11.7  (6.40),  14.6  (7.04)  and  16.4  (8.04)  points, 
respectively. 
CHOP-INTEND scores at 18 months of age (end of study visit) were available for 16 patients. The mean 
total score (SD) was 51.2 (5.67) and the mean change from baseline (SD) was 19.3 (9.13).  
Twenty-one patients (95.5%) achieved a CHOP-INTEND score of ≥40, 14 (63,6%) achieved a score of 
≥50 and 5 patients (22,7%) achieved a score ≥60 at any point of time in the study.   
The analysis of the gross and fine motor subtests of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 
indicate  an  ongoing  improvement  for  most  patients  with  the  better  results  seen  for  the  fine  motor 
development.  From  assessment  of  the  individual  data  is  becomes  clear  that  most  patients  show 
improvements on both the fine and gross motor skills subsets of the Bayley’s scale although the effect 
on the gross motor subset is less pronounced.  
14 out of 22 patients had reached the milestone of independent sitting for ≥30 seconds. One patient 
was able to walk alone. No milestones were recorded for 3 out of 22 patients, these were the 3 patients 
not completing the study due to death and withdrawal from the study. This data is considered important 
for caregivers and physician and is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
18 of 22 patients (81.8%) were independent of ventilatory support (as assessed by Trilogy BiPAP data) 
at 18 months of age (co-secondary endpoint, p< 0.0001). In total, 15 of 22 patients (68.1%) did not 
require any non-invasive ventilatory support at any point during the study. Fifteen (15) of 22 patients 
(68.1%)  received  no non-oral  feeding  support  at  any  time  during  the  study.  Seven  patients  (31.8%) 
received non-oral feeding support at some point during the study.  This is a clear benefit compared to 
the expected nutritional and ventilatory support based on natural history data. 
The ability to thrive at 18 months of age was a co-secondary endpoint defined as the ability to tolerate 
thin liquids, does not receive nutrition through mechanical support, and maintains weight consistent with 
age. Nine of 22 patients (40.9%) met the ability to thrive criteria at 18 months of age.  This is significantly 
different with natural history and considered clinically relevant.  
Supportive studies  
Study CL-101 
All patients treated in CL-101 were still alive at 13.6 and 20 months of age. At the end of the study, all 
patients were still alive with the exception on 1 patient in cohort 1 that transiently needed ventilatory 
support for >16 hours a day after a surgery.  
All  patients  in  cohort  2  showed  an  increased  CHOP-INTEND  score  from  baseline.  Mean  increases  at 
months 1 and 3, were 9.8 and 15.4, respectively (n=12, both p<0.001). At Month 12, the mean increase 
from baseline was 25.7 (excluding patient E08-208).  
At the end of the study (24 months post-dose), 11 patients from cohort 2 were able to hold their head 
erect without support for ≥ 3 seconds and sit with support, 9 patients were able to sit without support 
for ≥ 30 seconds, and 2 patients were able to walk alone. 
Of the 7 patients included in the ability to thrive population, 2 patients lost the ability to thrive on oral 
nutrition in the 24 months follow up.  
Non-invasive ventilatory support was used by almost all patients during the study.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 100/150 
 
 
  
  
Seven  patients  from  cohort  2  did  not  receive  enteral  feeding  prior  to  treatment.  All  these  patients 
remained free of enteral feeding except for one needing nutritional support after a surgery. The 5 patients 
that received enteral feeding at baseline were able to feed orally at the end of the study. 
The outcomes exceed the natural course of SMA type 1 that showed survival rates of about 25% at 13.6 
months of age and 8% at 20 months of age. Patients in the natural history cohorts only show a decline 
in  CHOP-INTEND  score  and  never  reach  a  score  above  40  after  6  months  of  age.  The  milestone  of 
independent sitting is never reached in the natural history cohorts. This is considered a large and clinically 
meaningful effect. It exceeds the natural course of SMA 1 on all these parameters many times.  
Post-hoc analysis on CHOP-INTEND increases from baseline stratified by gender, age of dosing, baseline 
CHOP-INTEND, weight, baseline CMAP values and time interval between diagnosis and treatment were 
submitted. Given the small sample size, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this analysis.  
The post-hoc analyses indicate that most benefit is likely achieved in young patients with high baseline 
motor function i.e. before the onset of irreversible motor neuron loss. Young patients with low motor 
function, or older patients with high motor function are also likely to benefit albeit to a lesser extent. 
This observation is adequately reflected in the current SmPC.  
Study LT-001 
Milestone achievements were recorded in study LT-001 to support persistence of efficacy. Nusinersen is 
documented as ongoing for 7 of the 13 enrolled patients (53.8%). This concomitant use of nusinersen 
hampers the assessment of the achievement of new milestones in these patients which can not solely 
be attributed to Zolgensma. In these cases, it is difficult to disentangle whether maintenance of effect 
or further improvement is due to Zolgensma, nusinersen or an additive effect.  
As of 31 DEC 2019, no loss of milestones has been seen across the long-term follow-up cohort in Study 
LT-001. Moreover, new video-confirmed motor milestones of stands with assistance were achieved by 2 
patients. Both of these patients have had a one-year follow-up visit and neither of these patients are 
reported to have used nusinersen at any point. 
CL-304  
Preliminary data from Study CL-304 was submitted by the applicant to support the safety and efficacy 
of Zolgensma.  
Cohort 1 (2 SMN2 copies): 
As of the 31 DEC 2019 data cut-off, 14 patients were enrolled and treated in Study 304 within cohort 1. 
All had survived without invasive ventilation and were continuing in the study. The patients were in the 
study on average for 10.5 months (range 5.1-18 months).   
Patients in this cohort show motor milestones development with is largely within the range for normal 
development. Four out of 14 patients have already achieved walking assisted and subsequently walking 
alone and 1 is walking with assistance.  
Bayley scaled scores show motor function within 2 SD of indicating normal motor development.  
Cohort 2 (3 SMN2 copies): 
As of the 31 DEC 2019 data cut-off, 15 patients were enrolled and treated in Study 304 within cohort 2. 
All had survived without invasive ventilation and were continuing in the study. The patients were in the 
study on average for 8.74 months (range 2-13.9 months).   
Patients in this cohort show motor milestones development with is largely within the range for normal 
development. Three out of 15 patients have already achieved walking assisted and subsequently walking 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 101/150 
 
 
  
  
alone and four were walking with assistance. Bayley scaled scores show motor function within 2 SD of 
indicating normal motor development. 
The follow up time and the heterogeneity of the natural history make it not possible to draw conclusions 
on benefit at this moment. Completion of study CL-304 is one of the conditions for a conditional MA. In 
addition, the applicant has committed to further characterize the natural history from patients with 3 
SMN2 copies and SMA type 2/3a based on available literature and patients from the RESTORE registry.  
CL-302 
Updated data with data cutoff 31 DEC 2019 was provided for study CL-302.  
Thirty-three patients of 30 planned patients have been treated. One patient (302-028-002) has died. 
The other 32 patients all survive without invasive ventilation and are continuing in the study, but one 
patient is not included in the ITT population for having been treated at 181 days of age (ITT population 
only includes patients treated up to 180 days of age).  
In  the  ITT  population,  the  patients  ranged  in  age  from  2.1  and  6  months  at  the  time  of  treatment. 
Patients in Study CL-302 were older at the time of treatment compared to CL-303 study patients.  
As of the 31 DEC 2019 data cut-off, 6 patients met the WHO-MGRS criteria for sitting without support 
for  more  than  10  seconds  and    8  patients  achieved  the  Bayley  definition  (Bayley  Scales  Gross  Motor 
Subset item #26), “sitting alone without support for at least 30 seconds”, which constitutes functional 
independent sitting.  
Completion of study CL-302 is considered necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA.    
In addition, more information both in number of patients as in follow-up time is necessary to assess the 
maintenance  of  the  treatment  and  to  assess  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  effects  (especially 
related to milestones achievement). This data will be obtained from the long term follow up studies LT-
001 and LT-002. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication is considered acceptable: 
Zolgensma is indicated for the treatment of: 
-  patients  with  5q  spinal  muscular  atrophy  (SMA)  with  a  bi-allelic  mutation  in  the  SMN1  gene  and  a 
clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1, or 
- patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene. 
The  efficacy  of  the  commercial  process  B  product  in  patients  with  2  SMN2  copies is  based upon  data 
from study CL-303 (pivotal study) and supported by preliminary data from study CL-302 and study CL-
304. The survival and motor milestones achieved largely exceed the natural history of SMA type 1. Data 
from study CL-303 and preliminary results from study CL-302 and CL-304 are in line with the data from 
the process A product investigated in study CL-101. The expected benefit is directly related to the extent 
of functional motor neuron loss of a patient; however, the exact inverse correlation is yet unknown.  
No data has been submitted to substantiate benefit in patients with 1 SMN2 copies.  
The data to substantiate benefit in patients with 3 SMN2 copies is limited. Due to the heterogeneity in 
the natural history for these patients, it is unclear whether the effect exceeds the expected development.  
It is considered that the efficacy for patients with 2 copies of SMN2 can be extrapolated to patients with 
1  or  3  SMN2  copies  (see  benefit/risk  assessment).  The  indication  is  therefore  considered  acceptable. 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 102/150 
 
 
  
  
Including a genetic diagnosis in the indication is considered acceptable given that SMN2 copy number 
determination is part of the standard SMA diagnostic process (see discussion on pharmacodynamics).  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
In  order  to  confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  dose  of  Zolgensma  in  patients 
younger than 6 months of age with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 with One or Two SMN2 Copies the 
MAH should submit final data on Study CL-303. 
In  order  to  confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  dose  of  Zolgensma  in  patients 
younger than 6 months of age with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 with One or Two SMN2 Copies the 
MAH should submit interim and final data on Study CL-302. 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety and tolerability of a single dose of Zolgensma in patients to 
genetically diagnosed and pre-symptomatic patients equal or younger than 6 weeks of age at time of 
treatment with SMA with bi-allelic deletion of SMN1 with 2 or 3 copies of SMN2, the MAH should submit 
interim and final data on Study Zolgensma-CL-304. 
In addition, the CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
In  order  to  further  characterise  and  contextualise  the  outcomes  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  SMA, 
including long-term safety and efficacy of Zolgensma, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of 
a prospective observational registry AVXS-101-RG001 according to an agreed protocol. 
The applicant should also perform a further evaluation of the finished product specifications when primary 
and  key  secondary  endpoint  data  from  additional  patients  with  2  copies  of  SMN2  are  available  (i.e. 
completion of CL-302 and CL-304 cohort 1). Based on this evaluation, it should be determined whether 
tightening of the release specification limits is needed to improve consistency of the batches and ensure 
optimal clinical outcome.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Table 25 shows the patients exposure of Zolgensma as of 31 December 2019. Nighty-eight (98) patients 
received the proposed therapeutic dose at the data cut-off of 31 December 2019. Study CL101 has been 
completed, with data available of 49->68 months of follow up after dosing (long term follow-up Study 
LT-001). Study CL-303 is also completed. Studies CL-302, CL-304, CL-306 and CL-102 are ongoing at 
the data cut-off. 32 Patients received Zolgensma by Intrathecal Treatment Administration in Study CL-
102.  
Study CL-306 is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of a single, one-time dose of 1.1E14 
vg/kg Zolgensma administered via IV infusion conducted in patients with SMA Type 1 who are genetically 
defined by a bi-allelic pathogenic mutation of the SMN1 gene, with 1 or 2 copies of SMN2. At the time of 
data cut-off, one patient was included in the study. This patient will be summarized separately under 
‘adverse events’. 
It is to be noted that the numbers of patients do not exactly align with the numbers of patients given in 
the  efficacy  section.  The  safety  database  also  includes  patients  from  IT-study  CL-102,  which  are  not 
described in the efficacy part. In addition, safety data of 43 patients who were treated in the US Managed 
Access Program (MAP) and post-marketing data up to 31 December 2019 is included in the safety update.

Adverse events 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 December 2019, 101 patients received an IV infusion of Zolgensma in 
Studies CL-101, CL-303, CL-304, CL-302 or CL-306. The only patient who is included in study CL-306 is 
not included in the pooled safety data but will be described separately at the end of this section. Ninety-
six (96) of the 97 patients (99%) experienced at least 1 TEAE and 56 patients (58%) were reported to 
have  a  Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  Event  (TEAE)  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
Zolgensma (Table 26). Forty-five (45) patients (46%) had at least one SAE and 39 patients (40%) had 
at least one TEAE that was Grade 3 severity or higher.  
Two patients (2.7%), 1 in Study CL-303 and 1 in Study CL-302, were discontinued due to TEAEs that 
resulted in death. In Study CL-303 one patient withdrew from the study because of an TEAE of respiratory 
distress which was considered not related to treatment with Zolgensma.

Table 19: Summary of Numbers of Patients (%) for Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by 
Study) for studies CL-101, CL-302, CL-303 and CL-304 
In  Studies  CL-101,  CL-303,  CL-304,  and  CL-302,  96  of  98  patients  (85.3%)  who  had  received  the 
proposed therapeutic IV dose of Zolgensma had at least 1 TEAE. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
across Studies CL-101, CL-303, CL-304, and CL-302 (≥10.0%) were pyrexia (47 patients, 48.5%), upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  (36  patients,  37.1%),  vomiting  (24  patients,  24.7%),  constipation  (22 
patients, 22.7%), cough (20 patients, 20.6%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (17 patients, 17.5%), 
diarrhoea,  (15  patients,  15.5%),pneumonia  (15  patients,  15.5%),  rash  (14  patients,  14.4%),  and 
transaminases  increased  (12  12.4%),  nasal  congestion  and  scoliosis  (each  11  patients,  11.3%)  and 
gastroenteritis (10 patients, 10.3%). 
Related TEAEs are events that are considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to Zolgensma by 
the investigator.  
At  the  proposed  therapeutic  IV  dose,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  considered  related  to 
Zolgensma  across  Studies  CL-101,  CL-303,  CL-304,  and  CL-302  (≥2  patients)  were  transaminases 
increased  (12  patients,  12.4%)  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (9  patients,  9.3%),  alanine 
aminotransferase increased, vomiting and  hypertransaminasemia, thrombocytopenia (each 8 patients, 
8.2%),  pyrexia,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease  and  rash  (each  4  patients,  4.1%),  platelet  count 
increased,  troponin  increased,  gamma-glutamyltransferase  increased  and  vascular  disorder  (each  3 
patients,  3.1%),  cushingoid,  diarrhoea,  constipation  gastroenteritis,  blood  creatine  phosphokinase-
muscle/brain (MB) increased ,hepatic enzyme increased, liver function test increased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, feeding disorder and diastolic hypertension (each 2 patients, 2.1%). 
Study CL-102 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 December 2019, 31 of the 32 patients (96.9%) enrolled experienced at 
least 1 TEAE. Twelve (12) patients (37.5%) experienced TEAEs that were considered by the investigator 
to  be  related  to  Zolgensma.  The  most  frequently  events  (≥2  patients)  were hypertension  (3  patients, 
9.4%), lymphadenopathy, vomiting, pyrexia, aspartate aminotransferase increased (each in 2 patients 
6.3%). 
Study CL-306 
One patient was included at time of the data cut-off of 31 December 2019. The patient was treated with 
Zolgensma at 5 weeks of age. The patient experienced the following AEs: respiratory distress, tachypnea, 
rhonchi and 2 episodes of fever. All events were mild, unrelated, and non-serious. No potential clinical

laboratory findings were reported. One vital sign met PCS parameters (heart rate >190bpm). This was 
transient and resolved without intervention. 
Serious adverse events  
At the proposed therapeutic dose in all studies, data cutoff of 31 December 2019, 45 patients (46.4%) 
had at least 1 SAE, and 39 patients (40.2%) had at least 1 TEAE that was Grade 3 severity or higher. 
Two patients (2%), one in Study CL-303 and one in Study CL-302 had a Grade 5 TEAE (fatal). 
Pneumonia  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  respiratory  syncytial  virus  bronchiolitis  were  serious 
TEAE’s events reported by more than 5% of patients (13.4% and 6.2%, respectively). 
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 TEAEs in Studies CL-101, CL-303, CL-304, and CL-302 is summarized 
by preferred term in Table 26.

Study LT-001 
For Study LT-001, only SAE’s and AESIs (gene therapy-related AEs; liver function enzyme elevations; 
new incidences of a malignancy or hematologic disorder, and new incidences or exacerbations of pre-
existing neurologic or autoimmune disorders, and sensory abnormalities suggestive of ganglionopathy) 
are collected. 
As of the data cutoff date of 31 December 2019, 8 of the 13 patients (61.5%) were reported to have at 
least 1 SAE. Reported SAEs have included events of pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute or chronic 
respiratory  failure,  bronchitis,  cardiac  arrest,  gastroenteritis,  hypoglycaemia,  and  dehydration.  One 
patient in the low-dose group (Patient E-02-491) had an episode of hypoxemic respiratory failure due to 
a  mucous  plug  leading  to  cardiac  arrest,  requiring  resuscitation  and  intubation.  The  patient  was 
subsequently  extubated,  returning  to  baseline  status.  This  event  was  judged  not  to  be  related  to 
Zolgensma treatment (data on file). 
There  were  no  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (e.g.,  gene-therapy  related  AEs),  including  new 
occurrences of malignancies, new or worsening neurological disease, new rheumatologic or autoimmune 
illnesses, or late development of liver injury observed. In addition, no new safety signals were observed 
over  a  mean  follow-up  of  57  months.  No  patients  discontinued  because  of  AE’s  and  no  deaths  were 
reported.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Study CL-303 CL-304, and CL-302 
In  study  CL-303,  a  transient  decrease  in  platelets  occurred  in  most  patients  after  administration  of 
Zolgensma at or around Day 7 and generally returned to baseline levels by Day 14. The baseline mean 
(±standard deviation [SD]) for platelets was 435.5 (±114.5) 109/L. The Day 7 mean (±SD) for platelets 
was 174.9 (±67.2) 109/L. Two patients had platelets below the lower limit of normal. The day 14 mean 
for (±SD) platelets was 394 (±112.5) 109/L. At the final visit, mean (±SD)  platelet value was 315.8 
(±110.6) 109/L.

Decreases from baseline in platelet counts were observed at multiple time points; however, no clinically 
significant changes were noted, and all individual patient platelet counts were considered CTCAE Grade 
1 during the study. Decreases were clinically asymptomatic, transient, and resolved without sequelae. 
Study LT-001 
As of the data cutoff of 31 December 2019, no TEAEs associated with haematology laboratory parameters 
were reported in Study LT-001. 
Study CL-102  
In  study  CL-102,  a  transient  decrease  in  platelets  occurred  after  administration  of  Zolgensma  at  or 
around Day 7 and generally returned to baseline levels by Day 14. The baseline mean (±SD) for platelets 
was 346.8 (±83.01) 109/L. The Day 7 mean for platelets was 270.1 (±108.67) 109/L. The Day 14 mean 
for  platelets  was  359.9  (±100.62) 109/L.    At the  final  visit,  mean  platelet  value  was  344.7  (±89.36) 
109/L. 
Chemistry 
Study CL-303  
At  the  data  cut-off  of  31  December  2019,  for  Study  CL-303,  a  transient  increase  in  transaminases 
occurred  in  many  patients  who  were  administered  Zolgensma  during the  first month  after  treatment. 
The  baseline  mean  (±SD)  ALT  was  31.2  (±10.8)  IU/L.  The  ALT  maximum  mean  (±SD)  was  189.5 
(±558.19) IU/L and occurred on Day 7. The median ALT on Day 7 was 39. The mean (±SD) ALT on Day 
14 was 39.5 (±61.2) IU/L. The median ALT on Day 14 was 24 IU/L. The Month 18 mean (±SD) ALT was 
21.6 (±11.9) IU/L and the median ALT was 17 IU/L.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 111/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The baseline mean (±SD) AST was 40 (±9.7) IU/L. The AST maximum mean (±SD) was 227.5 (± 501.3) 
IU/L and occurred on Day 7. The median AST on Day 7 was 77. The Day 14 mean (±SD) AST was 43.6 
(±11.8)  IU/L.  The  median  AST  on  Day  14  was  41.5  IU/L.  The  Month  18  mean  (±SD)  AST  was  37.5 
(±10.5) IU/L and the median was 36 IU/L. One patient had SAEs of AST increased (Grade 4, Day 7) and 
ALT increased (Grade 4, Day 7) and was considered to be probably related to Zolgensma and one patient 
had  an  SAE  of  transaminases  increased  (NR,  Day  29)  that  was  considered  definitely  related  to 
Zolgensma. These events did not lead to patient discontinuation and resolved during the reporting period.  
Hy’s  Law  (39)  criteria  and  liver  function  enzyme  changes  over  time  were  assessed  to  determine  if  a 
signal related to drug induced liver injury (DILI) occurred in any individual or group of patients. None of 
the patients met the criteria for Hy’s Law. 
The number (%) of patients meeting potentially clinically significant criterion for the Safety Analysis Set 
of Study CL-303 is summarized in Table 30.

Study CL-101 
In  Study CL-101,  4 patients  (26.7%)  had  a  total  of  5  TEAEs  of  elevated  liver  enzymes;  2  of  these 
5 events were classified as SAEs. Of the 4 patients with these events, 1 patient (the first patient treated 
under  this  protocol)  was  enrolled  prior  to  the  protocol  amendment  instituting  administration  of 
prednisolone. Following the protocol amendment to administer prednisolone 1 day prior to gene therapy 
only 3 of the remaining 14 patients receiving gene therapy had a TEAE of elevated liver enzymes. All of 
the  elevated  liver  enzyme  TEAEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  definitely  related  to 
Zolgensma,  were  clinically  asymptomatic  (eg,  no  jaundice  or  symptoms  of  liver  malfunction  were 
reported  in  any  of  the  patients),  and  transient,  and  resolved  within  the  observation  period  with 
prednisolone treatment.  
Study LT-001 
As of the cutoff date of 31 December 2019, one patient enrolled experienced a TEAE associated with 
abnormal chemistry laboratory parameters. Onepatient had a TEAE of hypoglycaemia. This event started 
at Day 217 after treatment and was graded by the investigator as a CTCAE Grade 3 (severe) event that 
was unrelated to Zolgensma.

Study CL-102  
In Study CL-102, baseline mean (±SD) ALT was of 21.9 (±7.7) IU/L. The maximum mean ALT (±SD) 
was 37.6 (±81.79) IU/L and occurred at Month 2. The ALT maximum value was 461 IU/L and occurred 
at Month 2.  At Month 12, ALT mean (±SD) was 15.7 (±3.8) IU/L. 
In Study CL-102, baseline mean (±SD) AST was of 40 (±10) IU/L. The maximum mean AST (±SD) was 
46.8  (±37.6)  IU/L  and  occurred  at  Month  2.  The  AST  maximum  value  was  229  IU/L  and  occurred  at 
Month 2. At Month 12, AST mean (±SD) was 31.7 (±6.2) IU/L. A single patient (Cohort 2, 1.2E14 vg) 
had very high values for ALT (≥1 to <3 years >150 U/L) and AST (≥1 to <3 years; >180 IU/L), along 
with  hepatomegaly  at  Month  2  (11Oct2018).  These  ALT  and  AST  increases  were  considered  probably 
related to Zolgensma IT by the investigator. 
Five patients had “very high” blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (≥1 to <3 years; >675 IU/L) that was 
not associated with hepatic enzyme abnormalities.   
In none of the clinical studies the Hy’s Law criteria were met.  
Cardiac markers 
Note  to  the  reader:  In  the  original  protocols  for  the  phase  III  studies  only  CK-MB  was  included. 
However,  because  of  preclinical  toxicology  findings  in  the  pivotal  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP) 
compliant 3-month mouse toxicology studies, all study protocols were amended to incorporate additional 
cardiac safety monitoring. Troponin I was not collected initially in studies CL-302, CL-304, CL-102, or 
LT-001, but these protocols were amended to include measurement of troponin in patients enrolled under 
the amended protocol. As enrolment had completed in Study CL-303, the protocol was not amended to 
include measurement of troponin.   
The cohort from study CL-304 with patients with 2 copies of SMN2 will be referred to as ‘cohort 1’ and 
the cohort with patients with 3 copies of SMN2 will be referred to as ‘cohort 2’.

Study CL-303 
According to the Applicant, two cardiac-related TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be 
related  to  Zolgensma  presented  in  one  patient.  The  patient  experienced  one  event  of  blood  creatine 
phosphokinase MB increase of 24.1 μg/L (normal value < 5.1 μg/L, severity not reported) on Study Day 
183 and one event of cardiac murmur (CTCAE grade 1) on Study Day 211, and one event of tachycardia 
(CTCAE  grade  1)  on  Study  Day  322.  The  cardiac  murmur  and  tachycardia  were  considered  by  the 
Investigator to be unrelated to AVXS 101. The patient’s elevated CK-MB was considered to be possibly 
related to AVXS 101 and was ongoing as of the 08 Mar 2019 data cut. One patient had a TEAE of blood 
pressure diastolic decreased on Study Day 1 that was considered to be possibly related to Zolgensma. 
The  other  5  events  (cyanosis  [CTCAE  grade  1],  tachycardia,  [severity  not  reported],  blood  creatine 
phosphokinase MB increased [n=2, each CTCAE grade 1]), and blood pressure systolic increased [CTCAE 
grade 1], were not considered by the Investigator to be related to Zolgensma. The event of cyanosis 
(CTCAE grade 1) in a Patient (onset: Study day 43; resolution: Study day 44) was reported as a serious 
adverse event. No further serious treatment-emergent AEs were reported in Study CL-303 at the time 
of the data cutoff.  
The baseline mean (±SD) CK-MB value was 12 µg/L (±7). Mean change from baseline in post-treatment 
CK-MB values ranged from –0.2 µg/L at Day 14 to +10.4 µg/L at Month 9. Individual patients change 
indicates no meaningful trends of changes in CK-MB values over time.  The majority of patients in each 
study have high baseline values and show no shift from baseline to maximum or final values.

Study CL-302 
Mean  (±SD)  CK-MB  at  baseline  was  22.7  µg/L  (±11.6).  Mean  (±SD)  change  from  baseline  in  post-
treatment  CK-MB  values  ranged  from  –8.4  µg/L  (±10.6)  at  Month  15  to  1.7  µg/L  at  Month  8  (single 
observation). Overall, mean (±SD) CK-MB ranged from 14.9 µg/L (±7.2) at Month 1 to a maximum of 
23.5 µg/L (±10.1) at Month 6, with exception of Month 8, which had only one observation (7.4 µg/L).   
A limited number of troponin I measurements were available for review (maximum of 5 observations at 
any time point). Mean (±SD) troponin I at baseline was 0.02 µg/L (±0.0, n=3). Mean (±SD) change 
from baseline in post-treatment troponin I values ranged from 0.0 µg/L (±0.0, n=4) at Month 6 to 0.027 
µg/L (±0.023, n=3) at Month 1. The maximum mean troponin I value was 0.06 µg/L (±0.023, n=3) and 
occurred at the Month 2. At Month 6, the last measurement available, mean troponin (0.02 µg/L [±0.0, 
n=4]) was the same as at baseline.  
Study CL-304 – cohort 1 (2 copies of SMN2) 
As  of  the  31Dec2019  data  cutoff  patients  with  2  copies  of  SMN2  had  a  mean  (SD;  number  of 
observations)  CK-MB  at  baseline  of  17.21  µg/L  (39.35;  n=13).  Mean  change  from  baseline  in  post-
treatment CK-MB values ranged from –0.45 µg/L on Day 14 to +12.70 µg /L on Day 7. For troponin I, 
mean  troponin  I  at  baseline  and  change  from  baseline  were  not  available  at  the  data  cut-off  of  31 
December 2019. The mean (SD; number of observations) troponin I of patients with 2 copies of SMN2 
on Day 7 was 0.04 µg /L (no SD; n=1); on Day 30 it was 0.08 µg /L (0.064, n=3); at Age 6 months it 
was 0.03 µg/L (0.006, n=3); and at Ages 9 (n=3), 12, and 15 months (n=3) it was 0.02 µg/L (0.00). 
Study CL-304 – cohort 2 (3 copies of SMN2) 
Patients with 3 copies of SMN2 had a mean (SD; number of observations) CK-MB at baseline of 7.43 
(3.35; n=8). Mean change from baseline in post-treatment CK-MB values ranged from –2.36 µg/L at 
Day 30 to +2.40 µg /L at Age 15 Months. For patients with 3 copies of SMN2, mean (SD; number of 
observations)  troponin  I  at  baseline  was  0.06  µg/L  (0.035;  n=2).  The  change  from  baseline  in  post-
treatment troponin I values for patients with 3 copies of SMN2 averaged (SD; number of observations) 
0.03 µg/L (0.17, n=1) on Day 7 and 0.06 µg/L (0.02; n=2) on Day 30. Change from baseline was not 
available beyond Day 30. The mean (SD; number of observations) troponin I of patients with 3 copies 
of SMN2 was 0.12 µg/L (0.120; n=2) on Day 7; on Day 30 it was 0.06 µg/L (0.025; n=3); at Age 6 
months it was 0.02 µg/L (0.00; n=4); at Age 9 months it was 0.02 µg/L (0.006; n=3); and at Age 12 
months it was 0.02 µg/L (0.00; n=2). 
The single patient with 4 copies of SMN2 had a baseline CK-MB of 4.80 µg /L. Mean change from baseline 
in post-treatment CK-MB values ranged from –1.80 µg /L at Day 7, Day 30, and Age 12 Months to –1.20 
µg/L at Age 6 Months troponin I was not measured in this patient. 
Study CL-101 
All patients enrolled in Study CL-101 had elevated CK isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB) levels at baseline and at 
the majority of assessments during the study; however, none of the elevations in CK-MB were considered 
clinically  significant  by  the  study  investigator.  All  observed  elevations  in  CK-MB  were  clinically 
asymptomatic. 
Minor elevations in cardiac troponin I levels were observed in Cohort 2 patients, particularly during the 
first 2 months after dosing. None of the elevations in cardiac troponin I observed during the study were 
considered clinically significant by the investigator.  By the end of the study all values had either returned 
to within the normal range or no longer met the pre-defined criterion for clinical significance.

Adult reference ranges are used for assessment of test results. Paediatric reference range for CK MB has 
not been established by the clinical laboratory. Twenty-nine (29) of the 30 patients had elevated values 
for CK-MB. Mean CK-MB was elevated at baseline and varied throughout the study. Cohort 2 (Zolgensma 
IT dose = 1.2E14 vg) had the most patient data (n=13). In Cohort 2, mean (± SD) CK-MB at baseline 
was 10.14 µg/L (±3.089), with a minimum of 6.6 µg/L and maximum of 15.4 µg/L. The CK MB mean at 
baseline exceeded PCS criteria (very high > 7.5 µg/L). Overall, mean (±SD) CK-MB ranged from 6.14 
µg/L (±2.5) at Day 7 to a maximum of 14.34 µg/L (±8.4) at Month 2. 
From all data provided it seems that individual patients change indicates no trends of changes in CK-MB 
values over time. The majority of patients in each study have high baseline values and show no shift 
from baseline to maximum or final values. As of the data cut off of 31 December 2019, troponin I data 
are limited data, however, troponin appears to increase within a few weeks after treatment and declines 
thereafter. 
Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms 
Selected ECG results were flagged when they met the pre-specified criteria: 
For all clinical studies, no consistent electrocardiogram or echocardiogram findings were observed. 
Deaths 
Up  to  31  December  2019,  two  deaths  were  reported.  In  study  CL-303  a  patient  died  five  and  a  half 
month after receiving Zolgensma treatment at an age of 2 months. The months before the patient was 
hospitalised because of to poor weight gain and respiratory failure. Full naso-jejunal feeding and bi-level 
positive  airway  pressure  (BiPAP),  was  introduced.  The  patient  was  discharged  with  resolution  of  both 
SAEs. Twenty five days later the child was found lifeless in her car seat after a 30-minute car ride. An 
increasing congestion for 2 days prior to this event was reported. The patient had not used the BiPAP 
consistently for the last week due to an ill-fitting mask.   
At autopsy no concurrent explanation for death other than respiratory failure due to muscle weakness 
was found. There were no overt signs of infection. The scattered lymphoid follicles within the lungs are 
considered  nonspecific  reactive  change  compatible  with  subclinical  viral  infections  or  aspiration.  The 
histological finding of increased intra-alveolar macrophages may also be seen in the setting of aspiration. 
The events and death were considered not related to Zolgensma according the Applicant. 
In  study  CL-302,  a  5-month-old  male  (weight  6.1  kg)  was  dosed  with  Zolgensma.  Twelve  (12)  days 
post-dose the patient presented with respiratory distress and was subsequently intubated. The patient 
was found to have at least two viral respiratory infections. The condition deteriorated on Study Day 27 
with significant hypotensive episodes followed by autonomic dysregulation, hypernatremia and seizures 
with  MRI  picture  of  diffuse  widespread  leukoencephalopathy  and  worsening  of  respiratory  status  with 
upper and lower left lobe collapse. Repeated attempts to extubate were unsuccessful and the patient 
died on Study Day 52 post-dose (25 January 2019). 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 119/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
At autopsy it was concluded that there was no specific post-mortem evidence of an inflammatory cause 
and that the encephalopathic clinical and pathological features appeared not directly related to the AAV 
gene therapy. The cause of death are severe complications due to respiratory tract infection, which in 
turn  is  quite  common  at  Spinal  Muscular  Atrophy,  resulting  in  hypoxic  ischemic  brain  damage 
Biodistribution  of  both  deceased  patients  shows  that  all  analysed  organs  were  targeted,  with  clear 
detection  of  Zolgensma  vector  genomes  and  RNA  transcripts  in  all  analysed  organs.  SMN  protein 
expression was detected in all regions of the spinal cord, at levels that were nearly equivalent to non-
SMA control spinal cord and in all regions of the one brain analysed. Motor neurons were similar in size 
and  shape  to the  non-SMA  control,  unlike the loss and  atrophied  motor  neurons  in  Non-Treated  SMA 
Subjects. 
Cases of special interest 
Hydrocephalus clinical data 
In study CL-303 one patient experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of hydrocephalus on 1 Oct 2018. 
This SAE was determined to be possibly related to Zolgensma by the site investigator.    
The  patient  was  a  7-month-old  boy  with  SMA  type  1  (2  copy  SMN2)  diagnosed  3  May  2018.  Prior  to 
being dosed with Zolgensma his head circumference was above the 90th percentile for age per World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  growth  charts.  While  pre-  and  post-dose  MRIs  are  not  available  for  all 
patients treated with Zolgensma, a brain MRI was performed at that time to evaluate the combination 
of  delayed  motor  milestones  and  enlarged  head  size.  The  brain  MRI  was  read  as  normal  by  the 
radiologist. 
Subsequently he was treated with Zolgensma on 24 May 2018 at the age of 77 days. He presented to 
his neurologist 1 Oct 2018 (Study Day 131) with report of 4 days of intermittent squinting and a bulging 
fontanelle,  along  with  3  days  of  irritability,  poor  feeding,  and  emesis.  Examination  at  that  time  was 
notable  for  macrocephaly,  bulging  fontanelle,  intermittent  left  esotropia,  and  papilledema.  A  head 
ultrasound  was  performed,  and  it  was  notable  for  ventricular  enlargement.  He  was  admitted  to  the 
hospital on the same day for management of hydrocephalus.  
A  brain  MRI  on  2  Oct  2018  (Study  Day  132)  demonstrated  ventriculomegaly  consistent  with 
communicating hydrocephalus. This was treated with a third ventriculostomy on 3 Oct 2018 (Study Day 
133), followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt which was placed on 6 Oct 2018 (Study Day 136).    
This patient experienced another severe adverse event (SAE) on 29 Oct 2018 (Study Day 159). At that 
time, he developed bilateral subdural fluid collections consistent with bilateral subdural hygromas due to 
cerebrospinal fluid leak from the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  He was hospitalized on 29 Oct 2018 (Study 
Day  159)  for  a  surgical  revision  of  the  ventriculoperitoneal  shunt.    On  30  Oct  2018  (Study  Day  160) 
surgery was performed. The patient had a right frontal omaya reservoir placed. A right occipital distal 
shunt  revision  was  performed  with  a  strata  2  valve  programmed  at  level  2.  The  hospital  course  was 
complicated by a pseudomeningocele around the shunt that was treated with an ace wrap, which was 
used to apply light pressure. The event resolved on 02 November 2018 (Study Day 163) when the patient 
was discharged from the hospital. This SAE was assessed as Grade 2 in severity and unrelated to the 
investigational product by the principal investigator.   
This patient experienced another SAE on 30 Jan 2019 (Study Day 252). At that time the patient was 
hospitalized for bronchiolitis and was intubated. During the hospitalisation another revision was made to 
the ventriculoperitoneal shunt to prevent future malfunction. Because the child was already hospitalized 
at the time of the shunt revision, this was not recorded as a SAE independent of the hospitalisation for 
bronchiolitis. 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 120/150 
 
 
  
  
The patient withdrew consent due to an AE of respiratory distress (Grade 3) just before the end of study 
visit  at  18  months  of  age.  The  AE  of  hydrocephalus  was  not  recovered/not  resolved  at  the  time  of 
discontinuation. This AE was initially reported as Grade 4 with a start date of 01 October 2018 and end 
date of 08 October 2018 (recovered/resolved with sequelae). The AE was downgraded to Grade 3 on 09 
October 2019 with an end date of 05 March 2019 (recovered/resolved with sequelae). The event was 
then  downgraded  to  Grade  2  on  05  March  2019  and  was  not  recovered/not  resolved  at  the  time  of 
discontinuation.  This  AE  was  considered  to  be  possibly  related  by  the  investigator  (all  grades)  and 
sponsor. 
Hydrocephalus Post-marketing  
In  the  post-marketing  database  (ARGUS),  one  case  of  hydrocephalus  is  reported  by  a  physician  (15 
September 2019). This concerns a report of a 5-months old female who was enrolled in EAR – Individual 
Patient Request – Zolgensma intravenous – SMA – use as per USPI. She received Zolgensma on 27 Aug 
2019  and  nusinersen.  Nusinersen  start  date,  applied  dose,  frequency  and  route  of  administration  are 
unknown.  Her  historical  condition  included  hydrocephalus  (Jun  2019).  Current  condition  included 
congenital brain cyst. Information on concomitant medication was not provided. It was reported that the 
patient underwent a surgery due to congenital brain cyst causing the increase of cranial pressure (AE 
‘intracranial pressure increased’. The physician mentioned the patient had hydrocephalus and secondary 
to congenital brain cyst. After surgery, the patient was clinically well. The outcome of the event ‘increased 
intracranial  pressure’  was  not  reported.  The  outcome  of  the  event  hydrocephalus  was  ‘condition 
improving’.  The  event  hydrocephalus  was  reported  as  serious  (hospitalisation)  by  the  physician. 
Seriousness of the event intracranial pressure increased was not reported. Seriousness assessment of 
the event intracranial pressure increased (medically significant) was upgraded based on the European 
Medicines  Agency-Important  Medical  Event  List.  The  causality  of  the  event  intracranial  pressure 
increased was not reported. The event hydrocephalus was assessed as not related. 
Acute Serious Liver Failure 
Since 27 Sep 2018, a case of acute liver failure (SUSAR) was reported on 07 Mar 2019 in the US Managed 
Access Program with Zolgensma. A 6-month-old male concurrently receiving nusinersen with baseline 
elevations  of  AST  and  ALT  (216  U/L  and  234  U/L,  respectively)  developed  acute  liver  failure 
approximately 51 days post Zolgensma dosing. Steroids were tapered starting Day 31 and ending Day 
43.  Liver  biopsy  revealed  inflammation  and  fibrosis.  The  patient  recovered  with  additional  steroid 
therapy. Steroid therapy was ongoing as of 20 June 2019. At the time of approval, there was no updated 
information available on that case. 
Liver biopsy:  
• 
• 
Massive ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes in Zone 3 
Massive  mixed  inflammatory  infiltrate  in  the  periportal  areas  (primarily  CD8-positive  T 
lymphocytes) 
• 
Mild periportal collapse on reticulin stain, moderate periportal fibrosis with marked fibrosis of the 
central veins with mild inflammation and associated sinusoidal fibrosis with focal portal-central bridging. 
• 
• 
Marked bile ductular reaction with associated neutrophilic periductular inflammation. 
No adenovirus, CMV, HSV or EBV detected. 
According to the Applicant, analysis of these clinical cases concluded that a systemic immune response 
was likely common to both cases. A case description is included in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
Moreover, a warning is included for careful consideration of treatment in patients hepatic impairment as 
well as monitoring of liver function for at least 3 months.

Pre-clinical Dorsal Root Ganglia Toxicity 
In October 2019 the Applicant provided non-GLP toxicology results from a NHP study, indicating dorsal 
route  ganglia  might  also  be  target  organ  of  toxicity.  In  a  completed  toxicology  study  in  cynomolgus 
macaques,  ‘most  animals  receiving  intrathecal  injection  of  Zolgensma  developed  minimal  to  marked 
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) mononuclear cell inflammation, sometimes accompanied by neuronal cell body 
degeneration or loss, at some or all examined levels (cervical to sacral). Inflammation was present at 
similar  incidence  and  severity  in  animals  given  Zolgensma  intrathecally  alone  or  in  combination  with 
contrast agents.’ 
However, the chosen route of administration for this non-GLP toxicology study was intrathecal. Although 
dorsal root ganglia are located only in proximity, excipients or impurities of Zolgensma, therefore, cannot 
be excluded per se as underlying reason for the observed findings. A uniqueness of the endothelial cells 
vascularizing  the  dorsal  root  ganglia  is  their  large  fenestrations  and  permeability  to  low  and  high 
molecular  weight  agents  (Arvidson,  1979;  Kiernan,  1996).  Either  being  AAV9  related  or  Zolgensma 
formulation related such toxicity might also be seen after intravenous administration. 
The  autopsy  plans  as laid down  in  the  clinical trial  protocols include  amongst others  ‘dorsal  root’  and 
‘DRG’  as  tissue  sample  for  analysis  of:  vector  presence,  SMN  gene  expression,  histology  and 
immunohistochemistry. The autopsy report of the patient from study CL-302states dorsal root ganglia 
were  retained  for  the  trial  investigators.  RPT-952  and  RPT-1342  indicate  dorsal  root  ganglia  of  two 
deceased human patients treated intravenously with Zolgensma have been analysed.  
For one deceased patient (study CL-303) an addendum to the original histopathology report is provided 
showing no findings indicative of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) toxicity, in particular no considerable myelin 
loss and no spheroids in the white matter funiculi. The dorsal and ventral roots that were available for 
examination appeared unremarkable.  
For  the  other  patient  (study  CL-302),  an  addendum  to  the  original  histopathology  report  and  final 
immunostainings  are  also  provided.  The  addendum  describes  the  microscopic  findings  of  the  section 
containing the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and related structures. 
“Microscopy: Two blocks (B18 and B21) contain DRG. The DRG in block B18 has mostly unremarkable 
appearances, but there may be a few nodules of Nageotte. The DRG in block B21 shows ganglion cell 
loss and there is an excess of small round cells. On morphological grounds, the latter are mostly satellite 
cells  and  there  are  some  nodules  of  Nageotte.  In  addition,  there  may  be  some  chronic  inflammatory 
cells. Immunohistochemistry is underway to identify the cell types. 
Please see the description of the spinal cord in the main report. In particular, the dorsal columns show 
activation of microglia on CD68 staining but are unremarkable on the other stains (H&E, LFB, CD3 an 
neuroflilament).  
Comment: The findings agree with those in the main report. In this addendum, I have expanded on the 
description of the findings in the DRG. There is some subjectivity in the assessment of DRG pathology 
but  in  my  opinion,  there  are  abnormalities  in  one  of  the  DRG’s.  I  have  reviewed  the  case  with  my 
colleague, Dr. M., consultant neuropathologist, and he agrees with this assessment.  
The cause of the abnormalities in the DRG is not certain, and I have considered three possible aetiologies.  
1. Direct contribution of Spinal muscular atrophy to the pathology in the DRG.  
2. Secondary to hypoxic/ischaemic injury in the terminal illness of this patients caused extensive acquired 
damage to the nervous system (including the DRG). 
3. Secondary to treatment with Zolgensma.

Conclusion: Dorsal root ganglia: “Abnormal.” 
According  to  the  pathologist  it  is  not  possible  to  distinguish  the  three  possible  causes  on  purely 
pathological grounds. It could be that more than one of these factors has contributed to the pathology 
in this case. However, it should be noted that DRG pathology is a feature of the underlying disease, and 
it may not be possible to determine with certainty if there was an additional contribution of Zolgensma 
treatment.   
The additional immunohistochemistry has not determined the aetiology of the abnormalities in the DRG. 
While,  there  are  some  inflammatory  cells  identified,  these  are  very  limited  in  number.  Summarizing, 
both  histopathology  and  immunohistochemistry  reports  do  not  suggest  a  significant  ongoing 
inflammatory process in the dorsal root ganglia. 
Taken  together,  the  histopathology  reports  of  patients  (study  CL-303  and  CL-302)  provide  some 
reassurance.  
In  addition,  the  Applicant  provided  a  review  of  the  current  (non-)clinical  literature  of  DRG  toxicity 
associated  with  AAV  vectors;  results  of  non-clinical  studies  with  AAV  vectors;  and  a  summary  of  the 
(non-)clinical data and post-marketing experience. The nonclinical finding of DRG inflammation reported 
in  the  non-human  primate  studies  was  not  confirmed  in  clinical  data  thus  far  through  the  analysis  of 
clinical data in either the Zolgensma IT or IV studies, as well as review of post-marketing safety data. 
Therefore, the clinical relevance of the DRG findings in non-human primate studies associated with IT 
administration of AAV vector gene therapies remains unknown. 
A conclusion on Zolgensma related DRG toxicities at the current state of knowledge is hard to sustain. 
Both  literature  and  this  additional  histopathology  report  discuss  the  underlying  disease  and  severe 
exacerbations  of  accompanying  complications  as  reasons.  The  best  possible  approach  is  intensive 
monitoring of the children for early and late symptoms. 
For the long-term observational trial, the list of events of special interest (AESIs) has been revised by 
addition  of  sensory  abnormalities  suggestive  of  ganglionopathy  next 
too  hepatotoxicity, 
thrombocytopenia  and  cardiac  adverse  events.  The  Applicant  amended the  study  protocols  to  include 
additional age appropriate sensory testing, and call for attention to new symptoms of pain, numbness, 
or paresthesias as part of the neurologic exam at baseline and at each visit in all ongoing clinical trial 
protocols for Zolgensma. The Applicant provided a clinical pathway to monitor for adverse events that 
might  be  indicative  of  DRG  cell  inflammation.  Furthermore,  DRG  cell  inflammation  in  included  as  an 
important potential risk of Zolgensma.  
Study discontinuation 
Two patients withdrew from study CL-303: the first patient is discussed below, for the second patient 
see under ‘Cases of special interest’.  
At the time of treatment, 16 May 2018, the patient was 154 days old, weighed 7.2 kg with a height of 
70 centimetres. The patient had genetically-confirmed SMA Type 1 with bi-allelic deletion of SMN1, two 
copies of SMN2, and did not have the genetic modifier.  
At the time of the data cutoff of 27 Sep 2018, the patient had experienced numerous TEAEs and with 
the  exception  of  a  TEAE  of  thrombocytopenia  which  began  on  Day  10  and  resolved  on  Day  17,  were 
otherwise considered unrelated to Zolgensma. 
Of note, the patient had experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) of pneumonia, respiratory distress, 
bilateral  atelectasis  and  severe  dysphagia  with  date  of  onset  of  20  Jul  2018. Ventilatory  support  was 
increased from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to BiPAP due to increased work of breathing. 
With the exception of severe dysphagia, these TEAEs were considered resolved on 29 Jul 2018. The SAE 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 123/150 
 
 
  
  
of dysphagia was considered unresolved. On 02 Oct 2018 the subject was admitted to the hospital for a 
G-tube  placement  and  Nissen  fundoplication.  The  surgery  was  uneventful,  and  the  patient  was 
transferred  to  the  intensive  care  unit  for  extubation  and  recovery.  On  03  Oct  2018  extubation  was 
attempted,  but  failed  with  hypercarbic  respiratory  failure,  and the  patient  was  re-intubated.  This  was 
reported as SAEs of acute respiratory failure and atelectasis. On 09 Oct 2018 the patient was extubated 
and BiPAP continued. On 19 Oct 2018 the event of atelectasis was considered resolved. On 28 Oct 2018 
the event of respiratory failure was considered resolved and the subject was discharged (data on file). 
Other Clinical Programs 
Eligible patients with a genetic diagnosis of SMA were treated in a Managed Access Program (MAP) 
under a Cohort Treatment Protocol. The program ended with approval of Zolgensma by the US FDA on 
24 May 2019. 
At the data cut-off of 31 December 2019, 43 patients, who received Zolgensma only, are included in the 
Managed Access Program (MAP) and/or RESTORE (registry) combined. The most frequently reported AEs 
include alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferases increases, each in 10 patients (23%); 
liver function test increased in 5 (11.6%) patients; thrombocytopenia and pneumonia, each in 4 (9%) 
patients; and constipation and vomiting, each in 3 (7%) patients. Although concomitant prednisolone 
use or dosage was commonly not reported, the elevated transaminases were mild and transient in most 
cases.  The  events  reported  were  consistent  with  those  seen  in  the  Zolgensma  clinical  development 
program. One case of obstructing hydrocephalus was reported, see also under ‘cases of special interest’. 
This  was  assessed  as  not  suspected  by  investigator  and  sponsor.  There  were  no  clinically  significant 
events of cardiac toxicity or sensory abnormalities related to DRG reported.     
One patient experienced two adverse events of cardiac arrest: approximately 2 weeks after receiving 
Zolgensma, the patient developed multiple episodes of hypoxia which resulted in bradycardia requiring 
chest  compressions  for  1-2  minutes  in  duration.  The  patient  experienced  three  of  these  events  on 
consecutive days with changes in ventilator settings remediating the cardiac events. The same patient 
was reported to have a second event of cardiac arrest approximately 6 weeks after receiving Zolgensma: 
the patient had a bradycardic event with her bowel movement in the evening. The patient received chest 
compressions for about 1 minute. The patient responded well to bag ventilation with stabilisation of her 
vital  signs.  Both events  were  assessed  as  unrelated  by  the  investigator  and  resolved  with  ventilatory 
adjustments.   
Safety in special populations 
To date, due to the low number of TEAEs considered related to Zolgensma, analysis of adverse events 
by intrinsic factors such as age, sex and race has not been performed. 
No  information  is  available  regarding  the  safety  of  Zolgensma  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment and in patients with pre-existing AAV9-antibodies above 1:50.   
Immunological events (Study CL-101) 
As expected, mean increases from baseline in anti-AAV9 titre were observed in all patients. In studies 
CL-303,  CL-304  and  CL-302,  there  was  no  development  of  antibodies  to  SMN  protein  following  the 
administration of Zolgensma. 
There is no apparent relationship between increases in anti AAV9 titre and increases in AST or ALT. Of 
the 4 patients that had significant increases in transaminases, titres elevations exceeding the level of 
quantification (> 1:819200) occurred at time points later than the reported adverse events of elevated 
transaminases.  Similar  elevations  in  anti  AAV9  titre  were  also  observed  in  patients  that  did  not  have 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 124/150 
 
 
  
  
potentially clinically significant increases in transaminases. This suggests there is no relationship between 
post-baseline  anti  AAV9  antibody  development  and  the  potential  for  significant  increases  in 
transaminases. 
T-cell Response to AAV9 and Human Survival Motor Neuron (hSMN) 
Temporal  relationships  between  AAV9  ELISpot  values  and  AST  and  ALT  elevations  were  qualitatively 
evaluated in the 4 patients with potentially clinically significant elevations of AST or ALT (> 3 × ULN). 
From this, ELISpot values did not reliably predict the potential for patients to have significant increases 
in transaminases. In the 11 patients that did not have potentially clinically significant increases in AST 
or ALT, ELISpot increases did not reliably predict potential for patients to have significant increases in 
transaminases. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on the mechanism of action, occurrence of clinically-significant drug-drug interactions following 
Zolgensma administration is unlikely. Therefore drug-drug interactions have not been evaluated. 
Experience with use of concomittant 5q SMA targeting agents such as nusinersen is limited.    
Discontinuation due to AES 
N/A 
Post marketing experience  
A cumulative search of safety data in the Novartis global safety database (Argus) through 31 December 
2019 was conducted. This database contains all post-marketing safety and literature reports, including 
cases  from  ex-US  Managed  Access  Program  (MAP),  patient-oriented  programs  (POP),  as  well  as  the 
French Temporary Authorisation for Use (ATU) procedure. As of 31 December 2019, a total of 192 cases 
with 488 AEs were retrieved from the Argus Safety database. Because of the limited information about 
the cases, e.g. concomitant medication, outcome, medical history etc., no firm conclusions that confirm 
or deviated from the known safety profile of AVXS-101 can be drawn. However, most reported events 
are  consistent  with  the  known  adverse  event  profile  of  AVXS-101.  In  the  list  of  spontaneous  reports 
there seems a notable tendency of occurrence of pyrexia after administration of AVXS-101. The Applicant 
states that currently there is no explanation on that. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety

The safety database of Zolgensma is small; at the cut-off date of 31 December 2019, 101 patients have 
received Zolgensma in clinical studies, via the proposed route of administration (IV) of which 98 patients 
received the  proposed  dose.  Twelve  of  the  98 patients  who  received  the proposed  dose  were treated 
with process A manufactured Zolgensma. Thus, 86 patients received AVXS-101 manufactured by process 
B via IV in the proposed therapeutic dose. In addition, 32 patients received Zolgensma via intrathecal 
route of administration at that data cut-off.  
Most reported adverse events (AE’s) were in the domains of Gastrointestinal disorders, General Disorders 
and  Administration  Site,  Infections  and  Infestations,  Injury,  Poisoning  and  Procedural  Complications, 
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders.  
Some of the observed AE’s may fit the almost natural occurring sign/symptoms in infants; diarrhoea, 
constipation, teething, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, otitis media and cough. Others may 
be disease related caused by weakness of intercostal muscles like respiratory events. Pyrexia was also 
quite  common  which  may  be  unrelated  to  treatment.  Eleven  (14)  patients  (14.4%)  were  reported  to 
have  rash,  of  which  none  was  considered  serious.  Onset  of  rash  occurred  around  6  months  after 
treatment with Zolgensma and is therefore not considered to be related to treatment. 
The  most  frequently  occurring  serious  adverse  event  (N=14;  13.4%)  across  studies  was  pneumonia. 
Twelve patients (12.4%) had increased transaminases, for three patients (3.1%) this was considered as 
serious. 
There is one case of development of communicating hydrocephalus in the clinical trial program, this case 
was assessed as possibly related by investigator and sponsor. In the post-marketing experience, there 
is one report of an obstructive hydrocephalus, this was assessed as not suspected by investigator and 
sponsor. 
The single treatment arm study design makes it difficult to disentangle whether an adverse event is due 
to treatment with Zolgensma and accompanied corticosteroid use, due to SMA1 or its complications or 
due to natural occurring background childhood diseases. 
AAV-therapy including AAV-9 vector are described in literature as a relatively safe treatment 11,12. Liver, 
lung, skeletal muscle, CNS, heart and pancreas are tissues that have tropism for AAV-99. For Zolgensma 
liver toxicity was observed. There were no overt indications pointing at lung, skeletal muscle, CNS, heart 
or pancreas involvement in the clinical programme. Biodistribution of both deceased patients shows that 
all  analysed  organs  were  targeted,  with  clear  detection  of  Zolgensma  vector  genomes  and  RNA 
transcripts in all analysed organs. SMN protein expression detected in all regions of the spinal cord, at 
levels that were nearly equivalent and to non-SMA control spinal cord and in all regions of the brain. 
Motor neurons were similar in size and shape to the non-SMA controls.

Because of the nonclinical dorsal root ganglia dell inflammation findings in a NHP study, the Applicant 
provided a critical assessment of collected data indicative for DRG impairment. For one deceased patient 
(study  CL-303)  a  final  histopathology  report  is  provided.  The  histopathology  report  (addendum)  of 
patient 303-001-001 showed no findings indicative of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) toxicity, in particular 
no considerable myelin loss and no spheroids in the white matter funiculi. The dorsal and ventral roots 
that were available for examination appeared unremarkable. For the other patient (i.e. from study CL-
302),  the  Applicant  provided  a  histopathology  report  and  final  immunostainings.  This  interim  report 
concludes that the DRG (block B21) was abnormal for this patient: ganglion cell loss and excess small 
round  cells.  Also,  there  were  some  inflammatory  cells.  A  cause  could  not  be  distinguished:  1)  direct 
contribution of SMA, 2) secondary to hypoxic/ischaemic injury in the terminal illness of this patients, or 
3) secondary to treatment with Zolgensma. The immunohistochemistry for block B21 has not determined 
the aetiology of the abnormalities in the DRG. The nonclinical finding of DRG inflammation reported in 
the non-human primate studies was not confirmed in clinical data thus far through the analysis of clinical 
data in either the Zolgensma IT or IV studies, as well as review of post-marketing safety data. Therefore, 
the clinical relevance of the DRG findings in non-human primate studies associated with IT administration 
of  AAV  vector  gene  therapies  remains  unknown.  Nevertheless,  sensory  abnormalities  suggestive  of 
ganglionopathy is added to the list of events of special interest (AESIs). In addition, study protocols were 
amended to include additional age appropriate sensory testing, and call for attention to new symptoms 
of pain, numbness, or paraesthesia’s as part of the neurologic exam at baseline and at each visit in all 
ongoing clinical trial protocols for Zolgensma.  
The following AE’s are of special interest: 
Hepatobiliary abnormalities 
One  patient  (E01-643)  in  study  CL-101  received  treatment  without  pre-  or  post-treatment  with 
corticosteroids. The observed increase in transaminases led to a protocol adjustment including initiation 
of  concomitant  immunomodulatory  regimen  using  prednisolone  prior  and  continued  after  Zolgensma 
treatment for at least 30 days post-treatment in order to manage the host immune response to the AAV-
derived therapy.  
Increases in AST and ALT were observed in the majority of patients within two weeks after administration 
of  Zolgensma  irrespective  of  prednisolone  pre-  and  posttreatment.  Continuing  elevations  have  been 
observed  even  under  concomitant  immunosuppression  in  two  cases.  However,  in  the  majority  these 
elevations recovered. For 14 patients increase in bilirubin was reported.  
Haematological abnormalities 
Non-serious and transient thrombocytopenia and lymphocyte count decreased were observed within 2 
weeks after treatment with Zolgensma. Also, after IT administration abnormal haematology values were 
reported.  Although  not  necessarily  presumed,  it  is  known  that  AAV9  might  trigger  systemic  immune 
responses even after local administration. This would explain the abnormal haematological findings after 
IT administration in some degree.  
Both hepatobiliary and haematology abnormalities that were observed after treatment with Zolgensma 
may  be  considered  as  an  immune  response  to  the  viral  capsid.  To  suppress  the  immune  response  a 
premedication  prior  to  Zolgensma  treatment  and  continued  treatment  with  prednisolone  is 
recommended. Thus far this treatment seems sufficient to suppress the immune response against the 
capsid. 
Cardiac markers 
In the majority of patients at baseline and during the study elevated CK-MB  levels were observed. It 
seems that the course of the development of CK-MB values differs from patient to patient. In addition, 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 127/150 
 
 
  
  
in study CL-101 Troponin-I was measured and half of patients had elevated levels after administration 
of Zolgensma. It should be noted that of these 8 patients, 2 (25.0%) had elevated cardiac Troponin I 
levels prior to administration of Zolgensma. In studies CL-304 and CL-302 Troponin-I is collected after 
protocol amendments. Data are available for 20 patients, of which 5 (25%) patients met the criteria for 
potentially clinically significant values. 
From the data it seems that no pattern of CK-MB and Troponin-I in relation to Zolgensma treatment can 
be observed. The cardiac abnormalities that were found in the patients are in line with what is described 
in literature for SMA Type 1 patients. Cardiac development beyond 2 years of age for SMA Type 1 patients 
is unknown. However, there is a signal of cardiac toxicity that might be of clinical relevance mainly in 
view of the observed pre-clinical findings and cardiac comorbidities of initial disease.  
Immunogenicity  
An  immune  response  to  the  adeno  associated  viral  vector  serotype  9  (AAV9)  capsid  occurred  after 
infusion of Zolgensma despite the immunomodulatory regimen, including antibody formation against the 
AAV9 capsid and T-cell mediated immune response.  
Patients with Anti-AAV9 titres ≥ 1:50 at baseline were excluded from the study. This cut-off  was not 
based on a scientific rationale but rather on a professional recommendation. Ten patients had increases 
in anti-AAV9 titres to > 1:50 at week 1, with even greater increases thereafter. No patients returned to 
titres < 1:50 after dosing.  
No immune response against the transgene protein was observed. 
Mortality 
Two  deaths  were  reported  per  data  cutoff.  One  patient  died  due  to  respiratory  failure  not  related  to 
Zolgensma  and  probably  SMA1.  The  cause  of  death  of  the  second  patient  was  most  likely  due  to 
hypoxic/ischemic  brain  damage  due  to  respiratory  tract  infection  requiring  artificial  ventilation. 
Respiratory insufficiency is a known feature of Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. 
Post-Marketing Experience 
As  of  31  December  2019,  a  total  of  192  cases  with  488  AEs  were  retrieved  from  the  Argus  Safety 
database. Because of the limited information about the cases, e.g. concomitant medication, outcome, 
medical  history  etc.,  no  firm  conclusions  that  confirm  or  deviated  from  the  known  safety  profile  of 
Zolgensma can be drawn. However, most reported events are consistent with the known adverse event 
profile of Zolgensma. In the list of spontaneous reports there seems a notable tendency of occurrence 
of pyrexia after administration of Zolgensma. The Applicant states that currently there is no explanation 
on that. 
Long-term FU 
The long-term follow up of the adverse events of AVXS-101 are unknown. The adverse events related to 
the  immune  response  are  not  likely  to  have  long  term  safety  consequences.  However,  the  long-term 
safety of gene expression is less clear. Though the carcinogenicity risk is considered low as AAV vectors 
mainly  do  not  integrate  in  the  host  genome  as  compared  to  e.g.  lentivirus,  it  can  also  not  be  fully 
excluded. Long-term data are needed to confirm this. Patients will be followed up till 15 years.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Zolgensma is a relatively safe therapy with a mild and manageable safety profile. The safety profile of 
Zolgensma 
is  mainly  characterized  by  transient 
increases 
in  transaminases  and  transient 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 128/150 
 
 
  
  
thrombocytopenia.  The  safety  profile  is  manageable  with  the  prednisolone  regime  used  in  the  clinical 
trials of 1 mg/kg/day.  
The safety database is limited and there are uncertainties regarding a potential of cardiac toxicity and 
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) toxicity observed in non-clinical studies. Assessment of the cardiac safety is 
hampered  by  the  observation  that  SMA  Type  1  itself  is  associated  with  cardiac  comorbidities.  The 
nonclinical finding of DRG inflammation reported in the NHP studies is not confirmed in humans so far. 
Neither the autopsy reports of deceased study patients, nor evaluation of clinical data of IT or IV studies 
with Zolgensma, and review of the post-marketing safety data allow a conclusion on Zolgensma related 
DRG impairment.  
On the long term, safety uncertainties with regards to gene therapy are undefined. This mainly pertains 
to the potential carcinogenicity.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety and tolerability of a single dose of Zolgensma in patients 
younger than 6 months of age with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 with One or Two SMN2 Copies the 
MAH should submit final data of study CL-303. 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety and tolerability of a single dose of Zolgensma in patients 
younger than 6 months of age with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 with One or Two SMN2 Copies the 
MAH should submit interim and final data of study CL-302. 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety and tolerability of a single dose of Zolgensma in pre-
symptomatic patients equal or younger than 6 weeks of age at time of treatment with SMA with bi-
allelic deletion of SMN1 with 2 or 3 copies of SMN2, the MAH should submit interim and final data of 
study CL-304. 
In addition, the CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
In  order  to  further  characterise  and  contextualise  the  outcomes  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  SMA, 
including long-term safety and efficacy of Zolgensma, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of 
a prospective observational registry AVXS-101-RG001 according to an agreed protocol. 
The applicant should also perform a further evaluation of the finished product specifications when 
primary and key secondary endpoint data from additional patients with 2 copies of SMN2 are available 
(i.e. completion of CL-302 and CL-304 cohort 1). Based on this evaluation, it should be determined 
whether tightening of the release specification limits is needed to improve consistency of the batches 
and ensure optimal clinical outcome 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.  
Additional expert consultation 
On  September  6,  2019  a  SAG  Neurology  meeting  was  convened  upon  request  from  the  CAT.  The 
following issues were discussed: 
1.  In  the  clinical  study  program,  the  applicant  enrolled  SMA  type  1  patients  which  were 
defined by genotype (bi-allelic mutation of SMN1 and 2 SMN2 copies) and clinical symptoms 
(onset  of  clinical  symptoms  <  6  months  of  age).  How  well  does  this  definition  reflect  the 
diagnostic approach in current clinical practice? In other words, how useful is this definition 
for the identification of the target population in clinical practice?   
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 129/150 
 
 
  
  
SAG experts considered that in real life setting, the application of these criteria may prevent potential 
patients with Type 1 SMA, for whom there is medical need, from receiving the treatment. The real-life 
situation will be that broader criteria will be used to define a patients as Type 1 SMA, as for example 
some 7-month old patients will also be diagnosed as Type 1 (as they will never learn to sit).  
The  patient  representatives  were  concerned  about  the  focus  on  the  Type  1  definition  as  SMA  is  a 
spectrum disease and the division into types is artificial. Also, there were emerging data that the better 
definition of patient severity should be to talk about “non-sitters”, “sitters” and “walkers”. This position, 
however, was not shared by the present experts, first because it was not used for the pivotal studies, 
and  also  because  it  can’t  be  predicted  individually  at  an  early  stage.  With  regard  to  the  proposal  to 
extend the indication to include patients with 3 copies of SMN2, the experts were of the opinion that less 
than 20% of Type 1 patients will have such a copy number. They agreed that, based on the observed 
phenotype, usually SMN1 type c, these patients should be included. 
2. The patients treated with Zolgensma clearly showed clinical benefit in terms of survival. 
How does the SAG value the motor milestone achievements so far of the treated patients in 
terms of clinical benefit?  
Experts  assigned  a  lot  of  clinical  importance  on  the  improvement  expressed  as  motor  milestone 
achievement, as it is considered that survival with no motor milestone achievement will not be considered 
as clinically valid treatment outcome in a number of EU countries, although cultural differences exist.  
The Patient representatives reinforced the importance of respiratory effects, including the emergence of 
serious respiratory AE (pneumonia), improvements in swallowing and other relevant clinical signs, in the 
evaluation of the clinical benefit.  
3.  Having  in  mind  that  the  current  proposed  indication  for  Zolgensma  is  “ZOLGENSMA  is 
indicated for the treatment of 5q13 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1”:  
a. The study population did not include patients older than 6 months of age. Is the SAG of the 
opinion  that  only  SMA  type  1  patients  younger  than  6  months  of  age  would  benefit  from 
Zolgensma. would patients older than 6 months benefit? Is there an age above which patients 
would no longer benefit? 
The SAG experts expressed a consensus that age should not be a factor restricting the treatment with 
Zolgensma. Data from other developments (Spinraza) show that patients over 6 mths still continue to 
experience  benefits  from treatment.  Some  raised the  question on the  permeability  of  the  blood-brain 
barrier  after the  age  of  6 mths,  and how  this  may affect  the  effect  size  of  the  expected  benefit  from 
treatment, but since this is currently not known , there was a general agreement that there will be a 
number of eligible patients that will be older than 6 mths and will still benefit from treatment.  
The preferable approach will be to be able to leave to the clinician in a dialogue with carers/family to 
determine the need for treatment, based on the motor, respiratory and general condition of the child.  
b. What is the position of the SAG experts on the possibility to include in the indication the 
treatment  of  pre-symptomatic  patients?  Is  this  justified  based  on  available  data  and  the 
extrapolation of data from symptomatic patients? How will a SMA type 1 patient be defined 
based  on  genotype  and  do  current  clinical  practices  allow  for  the  identification  and 
management of these patients? 
Experts were unanimous that treatment should start as early as possible, and pre-symptomatic patients, 
corresponding  to  the  approved  indication  (in  5q  SMA),  should  be  treated  immediately  after  genetic 
testing identification of biallelic mutations in SMN1.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 130/150 
 
 
  
  
 
4. How would the SAG experts define a patient in whom irreversible motor neuron loss has 
occurred  to  a  point  that  no  benefit  can  be  reasonably  expected  on  terms  of  motor 
development? How would such a patient population be identified? 
In clinical practice, a combination of factors is used, including CHOP INTEND score, the presence of signs 
of choking when feeding, severe respiratory distress, severe muscular hypotonia and others, in order to 
determine when there is no benefit to be expected from any treatment. CMAP (Compound Muscle Action 
Potential)  as  a  biomarker  can  be  used  as  a  guide  (CMAP<1miliV  is  signalling  severe  neuro-muscular 
junction degeneration) but is so far not reliable on its own to serve as a decision tool for not starting 
treatment. The decision to treat or not is always to be discussed between the specialist and the patient’s 
family. 
The patient representatives stated that benefit is individual and anyone that can improve the course of 
their  disease,  moving  it  away  from  the  expected  natural  course,  should  have  the  right  to  receive 
treatment.  
The  experts  expressed  concerns  about  patients  with  1  SMN2  copy,  who  are  unlikely  to  ever  produce 
sufficient  SMN  protein to achieve  meaningful  milestones,  resulting  in  a  severely  disabled  patient  with 
prolonged lifespan a very severe disease, and very low quality of life.  
5.  What  is  the  SAG  position  on  the  consequences  from  the  currently  provided  dosing 
recommendation restricted to patients in a weight range between 2.6 and 8.5 kg? Will this 
result in a restriction to the population that should be treated in your opinion? 
SAG experts agreed that applying a weight range as a factor will result in an unnecessary restriction of 
the patient population and should not be done.  
6. Does the SAG have any recommendations to study long term performance of Zolgensma, 
i.e. what DATA should be captured relating to efficacy and safety? 
Longer than the proposed 18, 24 and 36 mths follow up was recommended (specific studies addressing 
this point need to be designed), including a combination of motor and intellectual function (performance 
and socialisation at school age- around 5-6 years, was mentioned as a time point for follow up), in order 
to gather data on the long term effects of Zolgensma. Additional data on indicators meaningful to patients 
and  carers:  fatigue,  respiratory  performance,  swallowing,  pain,  functional  cardiologic  assessments 
(clinical  indices  are  considered  essential)  CMAP  evolution,  days  of  hospitalisation,  MRI  of  upper  thigh 
regions, should be gathered. 
It is important to state that the Type 1 patients should be with a much longer follow-up than proposed, 
as they will represent the greatest need to demonstrate a long term effect, and very little is known about 
the progression of treated Type 1 patients (particularly with 2 SMN2 copies), as for those who have 3-4 
SMN2 copies, appears to be very different from the natural history.  
PDCO FINAL ANSWERS: 
1. What is the minimum duration needed for assessment of the effect of the drug in SMA types 
1, 2, 3 and 4 (could be potentially administered from birth in pre-symptomatic patients). 
2.  In  particular,  what  are  the  meaningful  endpoints  (“primary”  and  “secondary”)  to  be 
captured  which  allow  for  long  term  assessment  of  efficacy  for  each  of  the  SMA  types?  Are 
there prognostic factors? 
The  experts  had  difficulties  answering  these  questions,  as  they  represent  a  combination  of  different 
phenotypes,  requiring  separate  evaluation  of  effect,  which  will  occur  in  different  time  points.  No 
consensus was presented with regard to the expected duration of studies, focusing on the different types 
of SMA.

2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group only for vial label 
component. The group rejected the request for the rest of the labelling particulars, i.e.  generic outer 
carton sleeve and variable outer carton label. The Group requested that a bilingual option should be 
explored by the applicant regarding the outer carton, to accommodate the German language. The 
Group also rejected the proposed packaging configuration (generic outer carton sleeve + variable outer 
carton label) 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will, however, be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 
January 2011; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit risk assessment 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Zolgensma (Zolgensma) is indicated for the treatment of patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy with 
a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and either a clinical diagnosis of type 1 SMA or up to 3 copies of 
the SMN2 gene.  
SMA  is  an  autosomal  recessive,  early  childhood  neuromuscular  disease  with  an  incidence  of 
approximately  1:  10,000  live  births,  of  which  approximately  45-60%  of  cases  are  SMA  Type 1.  SMA 
patients  lack  the  SMN1  gene  which  leads  to  progressive  loss  of  motor  neurons  and  causes  muscle 
weakness and death due to respiratory failure. Disease severity is negatively correlated with the amount 
of SMN2 copies, with the majority of patients with type 1 having 2 copies. Of the patients with 3 copies 
of SMN2, based on natural history approximately 15% is expected to develop type 1 (will never be able 
to sit independently), 55% is expected to develop type 2 (will never be able to walk) and approximately 
30% is expected to develop type 3a.   
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 134/150 
 
 
  
  
 
SMA type 1 is a fatal disease, and without respiratory support and tube feeding the majority of patients 
do not reach 2 years of age. Treatment is therefore aimed at prolonging survival and improving motor 
function.  
No information considering the motor and cognitive development beyond the 2 years of life is available 
for patients with SMA type 1. Also, no information on complications in later life are available in these 
patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There  are  limited  treatment  options  for  patients  with  SMA  and  treatment  is  mainly  symptomatic  and 
supportive, like orthopaedic surgery, physiotherapy and nutritional and ventilatory support.  
The  only  available  therapy  to  date  is  nusinersen  (Spinraza),  an  antisense  oligonucleotide  (ASO)  drug 
designed to increase the production of the SMN protein by modulating the splicing of the SMN2 gene. 
Treatment  requires  an  induction  period  and  regular  maintenance  dosing  (once  every  4  months). 
Nusinersen  has  safety  considerations  which  require  clinical  monitoring,  including  thrombocytopenia, 
renal toxicity, coagulation abnormalities, and haemorrhagic complications of lumbar puncture and CSF 
removal. The need for repeat lumbar punctures may be challenging as SMA patients are likely to develop 
scoliosis, contractures, and often require spinal rod surgery and/or spinal fusion surgeries for continued 
survival  and  function.  A  recent  publication  described  that  approximately  30%  of  patients  receiving 
nusinersen  who  complete  the  induction  phase died  compared  to  approximately  60%  who  received 
placebo. Nusinersen is indicated for the treatment of all SMA types (1-4).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study to support this application is study CL-303.  
However, evidence of efficacy from the clinical program includes in addition to study CL-303, data from 
studies CL-101 cohort 2, CL-302 and CL-304 cohort 1. Pooling these studies, the clinical study program 
includes 81 subjects with 2 SMN2 copies treated with the proposed dose. Fifteen patients with 3 SMN2 
copies are treated in cohort 2 of study CL-304. No patients with 1 copy of SMN2 have been treated in 
the clinical studies. One patient with 4 SMN2 copies has been treated in study CL-304 cohort 3.  
Study  CL-303  is  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  single-arm,  single-dose  study  of  Zolgensma  that  enrolled  22 
patients with SMA Type 1 who were either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic with no functional SMN1 
gene as well as 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 and who are < 6 months (< 180 days) of age at the time of gene 
replacement therapy (Day 1). Co-primary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients that achieve functional independent sitting for at least 30 seconds 
at the 18 months of age study visit.  
Survival at 14 months of age. Survival is defined by the avoidance of the combined endpoint 
of either (a) death or (b) permanent ventilation, which is defined by tracheostomy or by the 
requirement  of  ≥  16  hours  of  respiratory  assistance  per  day  (via  non-invasive  ventilatory 
support)  for  ≥  14  consecutive  days  in  the  absence  of  an  acute  reversible  illness,  excluding 
perioperative  ventilation.  Permanent  ventilation,  so  defined,  is  considered  a  surrogate  for 
death.  
Since  SMA  patients  have  very  limited  motor  skills,  it  is  challenging  to  assess  motor  ability  in  these 
patients.  The  CHOP-INTEND  (The  Children’s  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  Infant  Test  for  Neuromuscular 
Disorders) score is a sensitive score for motor function ability below formal motor milestones designed 
and  validated  specifically  for  SMA  patients  with  a  maximum  score  of  64.  The  CHOP-INTEND  score 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 135/150 
 
 
  
  
represents  measures  of  disease  severity.  The  CHOP-INTEND  score  was  included  as  a  secondary  and 
exploratory endpoint in the Zolgensma clinical studies. 
Study CL-101, was an open-label, dose-escalating study investigating the safety and efficacy of a single 
intravenous infusion of AVSX-101 in 15 patients diagnosed with SMA type 1. Three patients received a 
low  dose  of  6.7E13  vg/kg  (cohort  1)  and  12  patients  received  an  intermediate  dose  of  2.0E14  vg/kg 
(cohort  2,  equivalent  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose,  1.1E14  vg/kg).  Survival  without  permanent 
ventilation at 13.6 months of age was the primary endpoint in study CL-101.  
Study LT-001 is an ongoing, observational, long-term, safety follow-up study of patients who completed 
Study CL-101. Of the 15 patients from study CL-101, 13 patients were enrolled in study LT-001 (3 from 
cohort 1 and 10 from cohort 2). The study consists of an initial 5-year phase, during which patients are 
being seen annually for evaluation of long-term safety, followed by a 10-year observational phase.  
Study CL-302 is the European equivalent of study CL-303 with a similar design. Thirty-two patients with 
SMA Type 1 who were either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic with no functional SMN1 gene as well as 
1 or 2 copies of SMN2 and who are < 6 months (< 180 days) of age at the time of gene replacement 
therapy (Day 1)  were enrolled and treated. One patient meeting all other criteria was treated at 181 
days  of  age  and  is  currently  not  reflected  in  the  ITT  population.  The  study  is  still  ongoing  and  only 
preliminary data is available.  
Study CL-304 is a study including pre-symptomatic patients with 2 (n=14, cohort 1) or 3 (n=15, cohort 
2) SMN2 copies. Currently, information from this study is limited also. Data from this study is submitted 
to support the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients with 2 or 3 SMN2 copies.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study CL-303  
Of the 22 patients enrolled in study CL-303, 20/22 patients were reported alive and without permanent 
ventilation at 13.6 months of age. One patient was deceased, one patient withdrew due an AE but was 
reported to be event free at the time of withdrawal and one patient was reported to be on permanent 
ventilation prior to withdrawal.  
Patients treated with Zolgensma achieved motor milestones which are never achieved in natural history. 
Thirteen out of 22 patients had reached the milestone of independent sitting at 18 months of age. One 
patient had reached the milestone of walking with assistance.  
Formal  evaluation  of  the  co-primary  endpoints,  i.e.  event-free  survival  at  14  months  of  age  and 
independent sitting at the 18 months of age visit is outstanding.  
All  patients  showed  increase  in  CHOP-INTEND  score  from  baseline  during  the  study.  The  mean  (SD) 
increases  (improvement)  from  baseline  to  Month  1,  Month  3,  Month  6  and  Month  12  after  the 
administration  of  Zolgensma  were  6.9  (5.35),  11.7  (6.40),  14.6  (7.04)  and  16.4  (8.04)  points, 
respectively. CHOP-INTEND scores at 18 months of age (end of study visit) were available for 16 patients. 
The mean total score (SD) was 51.2 (5.67) and the mean change from baseline (SD) was 19.3 (9.13). 
Twenty-one patients (95.5%) achieved a CHOP-INTEND score of ≥40, 14 (63,6%) achieved a score of 
≥50 and 5 patients (22,7%) achieved a score ≥60 at any point of time in the study. 
At baseline, all patients were able to swallow thin liquids, and none required feeding or ventilator support. 
Eighteen of 22 patients (81.8%) were independent of ventilatory support (as assessed by Trilogy BiPAP 
data) at 18 months of age (co-secondary endpoint, p< 0.0001). In total, 15 of 22 patients (68.1%) did 
not require any non-invasive ventilatory support at any point during the study.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 136/150 
 
 
  
  
Fifteen (15) of 22 patients (68.1%) received no non-oral feeding support at any time during the study. 
Seven patients (31.8%) received feeding support during the study of which 2 patients needing a more 
sustained  support  (Nissen  fundoplication)  A  total  of  19  of  22  patients  (86.3%)  were  feeding  without 
mechanical support at the end of the study (or early termination).  
The  ability  to  thrive  at  18  months  of  age  was  defined  as  the  ability  to  tolerate  thin  liquids,  does  not 
receive  nutrition  through  mechanical  support,  and  maintains  weight  consistent  with  age.  Nine  of  22 
patients (40.9%) met the ability to thrive criteria at 18 months of age.  
Based on the literature available it can be concluded that few if any patients suffering from SMA type 1 
survive the first 18 months of life without any ventilatory requirement or nutritional support. 
The data from study CL-303 is supported by study CL-101, and the preliminary data of study CL-302 
and CL-304 cohort 1. 
Study CL-101 
Of the 12 patients treated with the therapeutic dose (cohort 2.2.0E14 vg/kg) of Zolgensma in study CL-
101, 100% was alive without permanent ventilation at 13.6 months of age. At 20 months of age and at 
24 months post-dose, this effect was sustained since 100% of the patients was alive without permanent 
ventilation versus 8% in the natural history control.  
At Months 1 and 3, patients in Cohort 2 had a mean improvement in CHOP-INTEND score from baseline 
of  9.8  and  15.4  points,  respectively  (n=12,  both  p<0.001).  At  Month  12,  the  mean  improvement  IN 
CHOP-INTEND  score  was  25.7  points  in  cohort  2  patients  that  were  treated  <6  months  of  age  (n=9, 
p<0.001).  
Nine patients gained the ability to sit without support for ≥ 30 seconds. Two patients gained the ability 
to walk alone. In the long term follow up study, the achieved motor milestones were maintained for the 
majority of patients.   
Ability to thrive and non-invasive ventilatory support stabilized or improved in the majority of the 
patients in cohort 2. 
Study CL-302 
At  the  time  of  the  31  DEC  2019  data  cut,  of  the  33  enrolled  patients,  32  patients  (93.6%)  had  had 
survived without permanent ventilation. Eighteen patients were ≥ 14 months of age and 4 were ≥ 18 
months of age.  
Eight out of 33 patients reached the milestone of sitting independently for 30 seconds.  
At month 6, the mean improvement in CHOP-INTEND score from baseline was 13.3 (6.54) points.  
Study 304 
At the time of their most recent visit prior to data cutoff, patients in the 2-copy cohort had been in the 
study for an average 10.5 months (range: 5.1 to 18 months)For the 14 non-symptomatic subjects with 
2  SMN2  copies  treated  with  Zolgensma  a  normal  motor  development  (i.e.  Bayley  score  and  motor 
milestone achievement) is observed up to 18.6 months after treatment. All patients are alive without 
permanent ventilation and none requires feeding or ventilatory support.  
Patients  in  the  3-copy  cohort  had  been  in  the  study  for  an  average  8.74  months  (range:  2  to  13.9 
months).  During the follow up time the motor development is within the normal limits and all patients 
are alive without permanent ventilation.  
EMA/200482/2020

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No patients with 1 SMN2 copy were enrolled in the clinical studies.  
For patients with 3 SMN2 copies, only pre-symptomatic patients were enrolled and follow up is limited 
(up to 14 months).  
There  are  important  uncertainties  about  the  long-term  efficacy  of  Zolgensma,  commercial  finished 
product. The database currently contains a limited follow-up for the 101 patients treated with an IV dose. 
In the follow up of CL-303 from the previous data cut until the end of the study only a limited amount 
of new milestones were recorded and only one patient achieved the milestone of walking alone.  
Information  regarding  benefit  in  these  patient  populations  will  be  gathered  in  study  CL-304  and  the 
registry study AVXS-101-RG-001 as part of the conditions. 
In general, the historical controls with 2 SMN2 copies are considered adequate for comparison with the 
study population. Although there are indications that the patients in the PNCR cohort have less severe 
disease (as expressed by the older age of the included patients), this is not considered a major issue 
since the potential bias this creates i.e. these patients are expected to experience the event earlier, is 
not  in  favour  of  Zolgensma.  Based  on  the  literature  on  this  topic  it  can  be  concluded  that  few  if  any 
patients suffering from SMA type 1 survive the first 18 months of life without any ventilatory requirement 
and/or nutritional support. Also based on literature it can be concluded that few (effectively zero) patients 
suffering from SMA type 1 would be expected to be able to effectively swallow safely and maintain weight 
within  normal  growth  parameters  absent  the  provision  of  mechanical  nutrition  support  through  18 
months of age.  
The characterisation of the natural history for patients with 3 SMN2 copies is limited. The natural history 
of this patient group is very heterogeneous. Within the population of patients with 3 SMN2 copies about 
15% patients present with the clinical picture of a type 1 patient, about 55% presents with type 2 and 
the remaining patients (about 30%) present with the clinical picture of type 3a (Calucho et al 2018). Not 
only the observed heterogeneity but also the (relative) short follow-up (on average 8.74 months) makes 
it difficult to draw conclusions on the efficacy of the pre-symptomatic patients included in study CL-304. 
The applicant has committed to further characterize the natural history for patients with 3 SMN2 copies 
(especially for the patients presenting with a clinical picture of type 2 and 3a SMA).  
No  information  is  available  on  the  cognitive  development  of  the  SMA  patients.  The  applicant  has 
committed to aim to record these parameters in the registry study.  In study CL-303, cognitive subset 
and expressive communication subset assessment of the Bayley scales were performed. However, no 
analysis was done for these variables. This analysis will be presented as an exploratory analysis in the 
final CSR of study CL-303.  
There is uncertainty about the effective dose that was received by the patients, as the infectious titre 
calculated  per  1013  vector  genomes  (vg)  shows  relatively  large  batch-to-batch  variation  and  vector 
genome titre decreases during storage of the product. The decrease in genomic titre during storage also 
hampers potency control as potency is expressed relative to a stored reference batch. This may have 
affected consistency of the potency of Process B batches, although the clinical impact of the potential 
differences in potency is unknown. As differences in effective dose could (partly) explain the variation in 
the  CHOP-INTEND  seen  in  the  clinical  studies  (CL-302,  -303,  and  -304)  the  applicant  committed  to 
further analyse whether tightening of the acceptance criteria for quality parameters is needed to ensure 
optimal clinical outcome.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Zolgensma was studied in 101 patients. In 98 patients the proposed dose via the 
proposed route of administration (IV) was administrated. Twelve of the 98 patients who received the 
proposed dose were treated with process A manufactured Zolgensma. Thus, 86 patients received AVXS-
10 manufactured by process B via IV in the proposed therapeutic dose. Of these 98 patients, 97 (99%) 
were  reported  to  experience  any  adverse  event  (AE).  Most  reported  AE’s  were  in  the  domains  of 
Gastrointestinal disorders, General Disorders and Administration Site, Infections and Infestations, Injury, 
Poisoning and Procedural Complications, Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders, and Skin and 
Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders.  
The most frequently occurring serious adverse event (SAE) across studies was pneumonia (N=13). Based 
on pre-clinical data, the Applicant pre-defined elevated liver enzymes, cardiac markers and dorsal root 
ganglia cell inflammation as AE’s of special interest to be followed up. 
Increased transaminases (AST and ALT) were observed in the vast majority of patients within 2 weeks 
after  administration  of  Zolgensma.  In  most  cases  these  elevations  were  transient.  Twelve  patients 
(12.4%) had increased transaminases, for three patients (3.1%) this was considered serious. A case of 
serious liver failure in a USA-patient treated with Zolgensma in addition to Spinraza (nusinersen) was 
described. 
Both haematology and hepatobiliary abnormalities that were observed within two weeks after treatment 
with Zolgensma may be considered as an immune response to the viral capsid. Increase in transaminases 
observed  in  the  first  treated  patient  led  to  a  protocol  amendment  of  standard  immunomodulatory 
regimen  using  prednisolone  prior  to  and  after  Zolgensma  administration,  which  seems  sufficient  to 
reduce the immune response.  
In the majority of patients at baseline and during the study elevated CK-MB levels were observed. All 
observations  were  considered  clinically  asymptomatic.  In  addition,  in  study  CL-101  Troponin-1  was 
measured and half of patients had elevated levels after administration of Zolgensma. After a protocol 
amendment  Troponin-I  is  measured  in  studies  CL-304  and  CL-302.  From  the  CK-MB  and  (limited) 
Troponin-I data no clear pattern can be distinguished.  
Non-serious and transient thrombocytopenia (N=4, for 1 patient this was considered a serious AE) and 
lymphocyte count decreased (N=2) were observed within 2 weeks after treatment with Zolgensma. For 
14 patients increase in bilirubin was reported.  
In two patient’s abnormal haematology values were reported after more than one year: eosinophil count 
increased that resolved and for one patient haemoglobin decrease which resulted in an ongoing anaemia. 
In long-term study LT-001 some patients were reported to have abnormal post-baseline haematology 
values. 
One patient in study CL-303 and one patient in study CL-302 deceased during the study period. In both 
cases the cause of death was likely due to complications of the disease.  
All  patients  in  clinical  trials  developed  an  immune  response  against  the  AAV9  capsid.  No  immune 
response against the transgene protein was observed. 
Post-marketing experience is consistent with the known adverse event profile of Zolgensma. 
It is expected that information regarding these events will be followed in the registry study AVXS-101-
RG-001. 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 139/150 
 
 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The clinical trial safety database for Zolgensma is small: data for 98 patients was submitted (data cut-
off 31 December 2019), to which Zolgensma was administrated in the proposed dose via the proposed 
route  of  administration  (IV).  Of  those  98  patients,  86  patients  received  Zolgensma  that  was 
manufactured by process B.  
Based on two biodistribution reports it is concluded that that Zolgensma was distributed to the brain. 
Because of the dorsal root ganglia dell inflammation findings in an NHP study, the Applicant provided a 
critical assessment of collected data indicative for DRG impairment. For both deceased patients (i.e. from 
study CL-303) a histopathology report is provided. This report showed no findings indicative of dorsal 
root  ganglion  (DRG)  toxicity.  For  patient  (from  study  CL-302)  a  histopathology  report  and  final 
immunostainings were provided. This report showed findings indicative of DRG toxicity. A cause for this 
finding  could  not  be  distinguished:  1)  direct  contribution  of  SMA,  2)  secondary  to  hypoxic/ischaemic 
injury in the terminal illness of this patients, or 3) secondary to treatment with Zolgensma. The additional 
immunohistochemistry  has  not  determined  the  aetiology  of  the  abnormalities  in  the  DRG  and  the 
appearances  of  the  few  inflammatory  cells  would  probably  argue  against  a  significant  ongoing 
inflammatory process. The nonclinical finding of DRG inflammation reported in the non-human primate 
studies was not confirmed by clinical data thus far. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the DRG findings 
in non-human primate studies associated with IT administration of AAV vector gene therapies remains 
unknown. Nevertheless, sensory abnormalities suggestive of ganglionopathy is added to the list of events 
of  special  interest  (AESIs).  In  addition,  study  protocols  were  amended  to  include  additional  age 
appropriate sensory testing, and call for attention to new symptoms of pain, numbness, or paraesthesia’s 
as  part  of  the  neurologic  exam  at  baseline  and  at  each  visit  in  all  ongoing  clinical  trial  protocols  for 
Zolgensma.   
There may be a potential for cardiovascular toxicity of Zolgensma based on non-clinical studies and the 
observed  increase  of  troponin-I  and  CK-MB  in  clinical  studies.  Given  the  high  rate  of  inborn  cardiac 
failures as concomitant disease at children with SMA it is unclear whether the cardiovascular effects are 
due to the disease or the administration of Zolgensma.  
The single treatment arm clinical study design makes it difficult to disentangle whether an adverse event 
is due to treatment with Zolgensma, due and accompanied corticosteroid use, due to SMA type 1 or its 
complications or due to naturally occurring background childhood diseases. The increased transaminases 
is an exception as this is in general reported within a short time after Zolgensma treatment.  
One patient experienced a SAE of communicating hydrocephalus in the clinical trial program. Another 
case of an obstructive hydrocephalus was reported post marketing. Based on the current evidence it is 
endorsed that any new cases of hydrocephalus should be subject to thorough follow-up. In the context 
of routine pharmacovigilance, the applicant is expected to discuss any unexpected findings or trends in 
the PSURs. 
Concerning AAV vector therapy uncertainties of the safety profile, in general, exist in the long term. The 
risk of carcinogenicity might be theoretical, but it is currently unknown and cannot be ruled out as the 
life expectancy of the patient increases. As described in the current EMA guideline on Advanced Therapy 
Medicinal Products (EMEA/1499965/2008) risks related to persistence of the product in patients should 
include malignancies as late implication.

3.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.8.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects and the associated uncertainties  
As untreated severe 5q SMA 1 is a lethal disease and the majority of patients die before the age of 2, 
the  primary  endpoint  of  survival  without  permanent  ventilation  is  considered  clinically  meaningful  for 
patients with 2 SMN2 copies. The difference in survival during and at the end of the study between the 
patients treated with Zolgensma and natural history in the patient population with 2 copies of SMN2 is 
evident in all submitted clinical studies in which patients have a long enough follow-up.  
Motor  milestone  achievement  was  monitored  in  the  studies.  In  the  natural  history  of  patients  with  2 
SMN2 copies, the milestone of sitting independently is never reached. The achievement of this motor 
milestone and all subsequent milestones is therefore clinically relevant.  There is however a significant 
proportion of patients that have not reached motor milestones, or only limited ones (solely head control 
within 18 months follow up). This information is crucial for caregivers and physicians to make an informed 
decision and is adequately represented in the SmPC.  
The  natural  history  for  patients  with  3  SMN2  copies  is  very  heterogeneous.  Of  the  pre-symptomatic 
patients, 15% are expected to develop SMA type 1 and never reach the motor milestone of independent 
sitting. Fifty-five % are expected to never stand up and learn to walk (SMA type 2) and 30% will learn 
to walk but lose this motor milestone (SMA type 3a). Motor milestone achievement in patients with 3 
copies of SMN2 is therefore difficult to interpret especially given the short follow up. 
The majority of the patients with 2 SMN2 copies had significant increases in the CHOP-INTEND score. 
CHOP-INTEND scores ≥40 are never reached in untreated SMA patients above 6 months of age. Since 
this is a sensitive scale almost exclusively designed for and validated in SMA patients, this is considered 
clinically meaningful. However, after 9 months of treatment the CHOP-INTEND stabilises around a score 
of 50 and the score is not predictive for motor milestone achievement. The consequences for the further 
motor  development  of  the  child  are  currently  unknown  and  this  should  be  followed  up.  The  expected 
motor  development  should  be  discussed  as  this  is  important  for  an  informed  decision.  The  few 
asymptomatic patients (N=10) with 2 SMN2 copies follow a near normal motor development reaching 
the  maximal  score  in  about  9  months  after  treatment.  However,  CHOP-INTEND  scores  in  pre-
symptomatic  patients  with  2  or  3  SMN2  copies  is  of  less  relevance  since  these  patients  exceed  the 
maximum motor function which can be measured with the CHOP-INTEND.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 142/150 
 
 
  
  
  
In  study  CL-303,  Bayley  scale  assessment  was  conducted  from  baseline.  This  motor  function  scale  is 
clinically relevant since it is norm-referenced and does thus provide insight in the development of treated 
patients compared to healthy peers. Comparing the gross motor scaled scores of symptomatic, diseased 
patients with SMA type 1 to those of healthy, unaffected peers indicates that SMA patients score poorly 
despite receiving some benefit from gene replacement therapy. This information is considered important 
and  is  included  in  the  SmPC.  Gross  and  fine  motor  development  in  pre-symptomatic  patients  with  2 
copies of SMN2 is largely developmentally appropriate and similar to neurologically normal peers.  
The effects on ventilatory and nutritional support are important and clinically relevant since this has a 
large impact on daily life and quality of life for patients. The submitted data indicates that patients with 
2 SMN2 copies treated with Zolgensma need significantly less ventilatory and nutritional support than 
can be expected based on natural history. Considering the pre-symptomatic patients only limited data 
are available. The information available suggest a normal motor development pattern up to 6 months 
after treatment for patients with 2 SMN2 copies. However, the number of patients as well the time of 
follow-up  does  not  allow  for  robust  conclusions to be  drawn.  This  also holds  for  the  pre-symptomatic 
patients with 3 SMN2 copies. The natural history for these patients is very heterogeneous. In patients 
with type 2 or 3a it would be more informative to monitor deterioration and loss of milestones however 
this is not possible given the short follow up time of the study.  
Nevertheless, there is strong medical need as well in patients with 3 SMN2 copies given that 15% of 
these patients is expected to develop a SMA type 1 phenotype. The large increase in benefit associated 
with  earlier  (pre-symptomatic)  treatment  makes  it  unfeasible  to  wait  until  symptoms  arise  to  decide 
which patients to treat. In addition, also (pre)-symptomatic patients with SMA type 2 are expected to 
benefit  from  treatment.  Therefore,  benefit  can  be  extrapolated  to  patients  with  3  SMN2 
copies.Confirmation  of  the  benefit  is  expected  to  come  from  study  CL-304  as  part  of  the  specific 
obligations.    
The uncertainty about long term efficacy is of importance. Data on maintenance of efficacy of the process 
B product will have to come from the planned long term follow up studies that are part of the RMP. It is 
of  importance  to  adequately  assess  motor-neurodevelopment,  cognition,  language  development  and 
quality of life in treated patients in the long-term follow-up studies. This is especially important given 
the uncertainties surrounding the comorbidities that might arise in aging patients since normally SMA 
type 1 patients do not live past 2 years of age. Variables of interest for caregiver and physician are the 
expectations later in life such as but not limited to; which are the milestones that might be reached, 
subgroups of patients with better or worse results after treatment, predictive characteristics and so on. 
This information is critical for an informed decision, should be analysed and included in the SmPC in due 
time.  
In  the long-term  follow-up  study  LT-001,  seven out  of  13  patients  started  treatment  with nusinersen 
(Spinraza).  For  these  cases  it  is  difficult  to  disentangle  whether  maintenance  of  effect  or  further 
improvement is due to Zolgensma, nusinersen or an additive effect. Further analysis of these patients 
suggests that the improvement with Zolgensma did not meet the expectations of caregivers and treating 
physicians and additional treatment with nusinersen was started. This did not add to the improvement 
in most patients. 
During the clinical development program of Zolgensma, the manufacturing process was changed. Product 
manufactured with process A was used in study CL-101 while the product manufactured by process B 
was  used  for  the  subsequent  studies.  Uncertainties  regarding  the  quality  of  process  A  cannot  be 
retrospectively solved and comparability between the two production processes cannot be concluded. In 
addition, there are uncertainties with regard to the effective dose that was received by the patients, as 
vector genome titre decreases during storage of the product. This may have affected consistency of the 
Process B batches and raises questions regarding the ability to supply patients with a finished product 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 143/150 
 
 
  
  
that is within the therapeutic range (see quality part). As differences in the effective dose could (partly) 
explain the variation seen in the clinical studies (CL-302, CL-303, and CL-304) the applicant committed 
to  further  analyse  whether  tightening  of  the  acceptance  criteria  for  quality  parameters  is  needed  to 
ensure optimal clinical outcome.  
Importance of unfavourable effects and the associated uncertainties 
The safety database is for Zolgensma is small, however a consistent safety profile is observed.  
Treatment with Zolgensma is associated with increased liver transaminases indicative of a cytotoxic T-
cell response directed against transduced liver cells. It is important to adequately manage the observed 
liver transaminase increase to prevent hepatotoxicity.  
The potential for cardiotoxicity is of importance since cardiovascular effects were observed in pre-clinical 
studies,  accompanied  by  elevations  in  cardiac  markers  in  the  clinical  studies.  In  this  perspective, 
Troponin-I data is important as it is considered a sensitive marker of cardiac injury. Another pre-clinical 
finding  is  dorsal  root  ganglia  toxicity.  Currently,  this  is  not  confirmed  by  clinical  data.  Sensory 
abnormalities suggestive of ganglionopathy is added to the list of events of special interest (AESIs) and 
part  of  the  neurological  examination.  The  potential  cardiotoxicity  and  DRG  toxicity,  although  both 
important, needs to be viewed in the light of the live-saving character of this treatment. 
Given the general uncertainties about the potential risks of gene therapy, long term monitoring of safety 
is  necessary.  This  mainly  pertains  to  the  monitoring  of  carcinogenicity,  which  at  the  moment,  is 
considered a low risk since AAV vectors do not integrate in the host genome.  
Currently,  it  is  uncertain  whether  there  is  an  influence  of  batch  to  batch  differences  of  process  B 
manufactured Zolgensma on the safety profile.  
The  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Zolgensma  will  be  followed  up  in  the  prospective  observational 
registry AVXS-101-RG-001. 
3.8.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of the Zolgensma process B product for the treatment of patients with a bi-allelic mutation 
in SMN1 and 2 copies of SMN2 (SMA type 1 phenotype) is based on improvement in survival that exceeds 
the expectations given the natural history of the disease. Symptomatic patients with 2 SMN2 copies are 
expected  to  benefit  from  treatment  with  regard  to  achievement  of  motor  milestones,  i.e.,  will  reach 
motor milestones otherwise observed with a less severe SMA phenotype. Preliminary data suggest that 
the  motor  development  is  plateauing  after  the  sitting  milestone  is  reached.  The  patients  that  benefit 
most  from  Zolgensma  treatment,  i.e.  the  pre-symptomatic  patients,  showed  improvement  in  motor-
development approaching that of healthy peers. As clinical experts assigned a lot of importance on the 
improvement expressed as motor milestone achievement, and as it is considered that survival with no 
motor milestone achievement limits the clinically validity of the treatment outcome (although cultural 
differences  exist),  it  is  considered  to  follow  the  motor  development  in  these  patients.  Based  on  the 
current  available  information  and  respecting  the  cultural  differences  an  indication  including  clinically 
diagnosed type 1 SMA patients and those subjects with 2 SMN2 copies is considered acceptable.  
Given  the  limited  follow-up  in  patients  with  3  SMN2  copies,  benefit  cannot  be  substantiated  by  data. 
However,  the  combined  5q  pathomechanism/Zolgensma  mode  of  action  results  in  potential  higher 
benefit in the presence of quantitatively more viable motor neurons. Patients with 3 copies of SMN2 can 
reasonably be expected to have a higher number of viable motor neurons compared to an age matched 
patient with 2 copies of SMN2. Extrapolation from the 2 SMN2 copy data to 3 SMN2 copy patients seems 
possible and justifiable given the expected progression of the disease (15% will develop type 1 and 50% 
will develop type 2 SMA). Further, it is assumed that the results obtained with the populations studied 
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 144/150 
 
 
  
  
can be extrapolated to patients with type 2 SMA. Withholding treatment from these patients would leave 
a considerable number of type 1 patients and type 2 patients in need of treatment untreated. Treatment 
of these patients with 3 SMN2 copies is not outweighed by the treatment of patients with 3 SMN2 copies 
that might be expected to develop a milder form of SMA (type 3a, approximately 30%) for which the 
benefit –risk of the treatment with Zolgensma remains to be established.  
No patients were enrolled and treated in the studies with 1 copy of SMN2. Although there are concerns 
that treatment in the majority of patients is futile, the warnings in the SmPC are considered sufficient to 
guide an informed decision on a case-by-case basis on which patient might benefit from treatment.  
There is a concern that an indication based on the genetic diagnosis will exclude patients presenting with 
a  severe  phenotype  despite  having  more  than  3  copies  of  the  SMN2  gene.  It  is  therefore  considered 
necessary to include the clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1 as follows: 
Zolgensma is indicated for the treatment of: 
-  patients  with  5q  spinal  muscular  atrophy  (SMA)  with  a  bi-allelic  mutation  in  the  SMN1  gene  and  a 
clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1, or 
- patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene. 
Zolgensma was shown to be relatively safe. The adverse effects following dosing with Zolgensma could 
be primarily contributed to the immune response against the AAV9 capsid. These events, elevated liver 
transaminases  and  thrombocytopenia  were  sufficiently  managed  with  a  prednisolone  regimen  used  in 
the clinical trials.  
Concerns about possible cardiovascular and DRG toxicity have been solved after the provision of a cardiac 
safety  report,  a  clinical  impact  assessment  of  DRG  toxicity,  immunohistochemistry  reports of  the two 
deceased patients and measures to monitor treated patients for symptoms indicative for DRG adverse 
events.  
From a quality perspective, uncertainties with regard to control of the effective dose remain, as genomic 
titre decreases during storage and no stable reference standard is available to control the potency of the 
product.  However,  consistency  of  the  potency  measurement  will  be  further  ensured  for  commercial 
manufacturing  by  the  implementation  of  an  assay  control  and  adequate  monitoring  of  stability  and 
performance of the reference standard. In addition, the applicant committed to perform next generation 
sequencing on the first 30 commercial batches, which will provide assurance of vector genome integrity 
and,  together  with  proof  of  vector  infectivity  and  therapeutic  protein  expression,  indirectly,  biological 
activity. The applicant’s evaluation of batch release data and the relation between clinical outcome and 
FP attributes did not identify a need to tighten the FP specifications. However, clinical data are considered 
currently too limited to reach a final conclusion. The applicant committed to perform a further evaluation 
of the FP specifications when additional patient data are available. Based on this evaluation it should be 
determined whether tightening of the release specifications limits is needed to improve consistency of 
the batches and ensure optimal clinical outcome.  
In the current medical treatment arsenal for patients with SMA type 1 there is still an unmet medical 
need.      
3.8.3.  Additional considerations  
A Scientific Advisory Group was convened at the request of the Committees. 
The  SAG  experts  expressed  a  consensus  that  age  and  weight  should  not  be  a  factor  restricting  the 
treatment.  Experts  were  unanimous  that  treatment  should  start  as  early  as  possible,  and  pre-
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 145/150 
 
 
  
  
symptomatic  patients,  corresponding  to  the  approved  indication  (in  5q  SMA),  should  be  treated 
immediately after genetic testing identification of bi-allelic mutations in SMN1.  
In clinical practice, a combination of characteristics is used, including CHOP INTEND score, the presence 
of signs of choking when feeding, severe respiratory distress, severe muscular hypotonia and others, in 
order to determine when there is no benefit to be expected from any treatment.  
The dose finding for Zolgensma was not optimal, leading to uncertainties about the optimal effective and 
tolerable  dose.  In  addition,  the  Applicant  is  conducting  clinical  studies  investigating  the  intrathecal 
administration of Zolgensma in the treatment of SMA type 2. Intrathecal infusion might be effective in 
lower total dosages and might also lead to a less severe immune response. However, currently these 
studies  are  on  hold  as  unexpected  serious  adverse  events  are  observes  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
(inflammation of the spinal ganglions).  
The only other approved therapy for SMA at this moment is nusinersen (Spinraza). Efficacy of nusinersen 
was based on several clinical studies, among one phase 3 study in which nusinersen was compared to 
placebo  in  a  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  sham-procedure  controlled  study  in  121  patients 
with bi-allelic deletion of SMN1, 2 SMN2 copies and age of onset ≤6 months of age.  
27/80  (34%)  patients  who  died  or  required  permanent  ventilation  on  nusinersen  compared  to  20/41 
(49%) on control. There were 12/80 (15%) deaths on nusinersen, compared to 13 (32%) on control. A 
statistically  significantly  higher  percentage  of  subjects  achieved  a  CHOP  INTEND  response  in  the 
nusinersen group (71%) compared to the control group (3%; p<0.0001). Several of the infants treated 
with nusinersen had improvements of 10 points or more on the CHOP INTEND total score. Sixteen (22%) 
achieved  full  head  control,  six  (8%)  achieved  independent  sitting  and  one  achieved  standing  with 
support.  Except  for  one  subject,  all  subjects  in  the  control  group  showed  no  change  or  worsened. 
Although it is clear patients benefit from nusinersen treatment, indirect comparison with the results of 
nusinersen indicate that the effects on survival, CHOP-INTEND score and motor milestone achievement 
of Zolgensma supersede the effects of nusinersen in the SMA type 1 population. In addition, the single 
treatment of Zolgensma is an advantage for the patients compared to the need for repeated treatment 
with nusinersen. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
During the evaluation, the applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation. The product falls within 
the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims 
at the treatment life-threatening disease, and is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
The product is considered to fulfil the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation based on 
the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The  benefit-risk  balance  based  on  interim  phase  III  data  is  positive.  Zolgensma  is  designed  to 
address  the  monogenic  root  cause  of  SMA  by  replacing  the  defective  SMN1  gene  resulting  in 
increased levels of SMN protein. 
Data from the following studies is anticipated to address the uncertainties of an initial CMA based 
on data from study CL-101 and the interim data of the ongoing phase III studies:  
• 
Study  CL-303,  US  phase  III  study  investigating  the  therapeutic  IV  dose  in  SMA  type  1 
patients. Study is completed and full CSR for this study is expected in September 2020. 
The applicant has committed to include in the final CSR of study CL-303:  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 146/150 
 
 
  
  
  An analysis of cognitive and expressive communication domains of the Bayley scales 
(change from baseline in raw and scaled scores) should be provided in the final CSR 
for study CL-303 as an exploratory analysis. 
  A  presentation  of  the  normal  range  of  the  Bayley  scale  scores  in  the  graphical 
representations of the data.  
  The formal analysis of the co-primary endpoints. 
• 
• 
Study  CL-302,  EU  phase  III  study  investigating  the  therapeutic  IV  dose  in  SMA  type  1 
patients. Full CSR for this study is expected in August 2021.  
Study CL-304. EU phase III study investigating the therapeutic IV dose in pre-symptomatic 
patients. Full CSR for this study is expected by August 2026.   
Data from the ongoing studies should confirm the interim data so far presented by the Applicant 
with respect to (but not limited to): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
confirmatory end of study survival data 
further achievement and maintenance of motor milestones 
improvements in motor function as measured by CHOP INTEND and Bayley scale scores 
indications of halted disease progression with respect to nutritional and ventilatory support 
Experts  and  caregivers  also  considered  that  information  in  motor  and  cognitive  development  is 
key, and the ongoing studies should help us find a treatment decision model that identifies the 
most important positive and negative predictors.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed.  
Although  another  available  treatment  option  is  nusinersen,  nusinersen  treatment  is  associated 
with  significant  burden  for  the  patient  since  it  requires  lifelong  intrathecal  injection,  associated 
with safety risks. It is agreed that the data from Zolgensma assessed so far strongly suggests that 
the  efficacy  of  Zolgensma  in  the  intended  patient  population  will  exceed  that  of  nusinersen.  In 
addition, it is considered that given the difference in mechanism of action between nusinersen and 
Zolgensma, Zolgensma is expected to be more efficacious in patients with 2 SMN2 copies since 
nusinersen boosts the transcription of full-length protein from the SMN2 gene. Therefore, a major 
therapeutic advantage for Zolgensma is to be expected. 
From a clinical point of view, the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.  
In addition, the CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety and 
efficacy: 
In  order  to  further  characterise  and  contextualise  the  outcomes  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  SMA, 
including long-term safety and efficacy of Zolgensma, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of 
a prospective observational registry AVXS-101-RG001 according to an agreed protocol. 
The applicant should also perform a further evaluation of the finished product specifications when 
primary and key secondary endpoint data from additional patients with 2 copies of SMN2 are available 
(i.e. completion of CL-302 and CL-304 cohort 1). Based on this evaluation, it should be determined 
whether tightening of the release specification limits is needed to improve consistency of the batches 
and ensure optimal clinical outcome.  
EMA/200482/2020 
Page 147/150 
 
 
  
  
The evaluation should take into account 1) product stability and 2) the correlation between critical 
quality attributes (genomic titre, infectious titre, in vitro relative potency) and clinical outcome in 
terms of survival, ventilatory support, motor milestones and relevant motor function scores (Bayley) in 
(pre-)symptomatic subjects born with 2 SMN2 copies.  
The correlation evaluation should include a complete evaluation of the range of FP data against clinical 
data (e.g. comparing the higher and lower ranges of critical quality attributes) and consider whether 
batches at the end of shelf life perform as well as batches at the beginning of shelf life. The analysis 
will take into account known sources of variability in assays and measurement techniques. 
The estimated dose given to the patient (vg/kg as determined based on the estimated genomic titre of 
the product batch at the time of dosing (taking into account stability data) should be included as 
additional quality attribute. 
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zolgensma is positive. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Zolgensma is not similar to Spinraza within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
The CHMP endorsed the above CAT conclusion. 
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that 
the benefit- risk balance of Zolgensma is favourable in the following indication: 
Zolgensma is indicated for the treatment of: 
-  patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and a 
clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, or  
-  patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 
gene. 
Based on the draft  opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit- risk balance of Zolgensma in the treatment of the 
above indication is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions:

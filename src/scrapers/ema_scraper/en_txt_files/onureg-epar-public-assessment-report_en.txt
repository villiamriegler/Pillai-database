2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Onureg was proposed to be indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not 
candidates for, including those who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
In  the  EU,  the  occurrence  of  newly  diagnosed  AML  was  estimated  at  approximately  18,000  cases  annually 
(Rodriguez-Abreu, 2007) with age-adjusted incidence of 3.7 per 100,000 annually (4.0 per 100,000 for males 
and 3.4 per 100,000 for females) (Visser, 2012). Based on the incidence data and the total European Union of 
27  member  states  (EU-27)  population,  42,795  new  diagnoses  of  myeloid  malignancies  occur  in  the  EU-27 
annually, including 18,376 cases of AML (43%). The complete AML prevalence proportion as of 01 Jan 2003 
was  11.0  per  100,000  persons  with  an  estimated  54,619  cases  in  the  EU-27  in  2008.  Based  on  this,  the 
estimated prevalence of AML in Europe is approximately 1.1 per 10,000 persons (Visser, 2012). In the US, it 
is estimated that 21,430 new AML cases and 10,920 deaths would have occurred in 2019 (Siegel, 2019). The 
age-adjusted incidence of AML in the US is 4.3 per 100,000 annually in the US (Shallis, 2019). Overall, the 
incidence of AML increases with age with median age at diagnosis of 68 years and median age at death of 72 
years  and  the  age  adjusted  incidence  for  those  older  than  65  years  being  20.1  per  100,000  person-years 
compared  with  2.0  per  100,000  person-years  for  individuals  younger  than  65  (Visser,  2012;  SEER  cancer 
statistics review, 1975-2015; Shallis, 2019). The proportion of males:females diagnosed with AML is 1.6:1 with 
an age-adjusted incidence of 5.42 and 3.47 per 100,000 person-years, respectively (Shallis, 2019). 
In Europe, the annual incidence of AML in adults is 5 to 8 cases per 100.000 individuals with a mortality rate 
of 4 to 6 cases per 100.000. (1) The median age at diagnosis is 67 years, but the incidence increases by age 
with a projected incidence of 15 to 25 cases per 100.000 in patients who are 70 years of age or older. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
AML is a rare, heterogeneous, and aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by rapid progression of 
the disease and symptoms and is uniformly fatal if not treated.  
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia, characterised by infiltration of proliferative, clonal, abnormally 
differentiated,  and  occasionally  poorly  differentiated  haematopoietic  cells  of  myeloid  lineage  in  the  bone 
marrow, blood, and other tissues. 
Factors that influence prognosis in AML include both patient-related factors and disease-related factors, with 
age  at  diagnosis  being  the  most  significant  patient-related  factor  and  genetic  risk  category  being  the  most 
influential disease-related factor (Döhner, 2017; Shallis, 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 8/101 
 
 
 
Cytogenetic and molecular genetic risk categorization are major prognostic factors for determining relapse and 
OS outcomes and form the basis for the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) genetic risk stratification (Döhner, 2017; 
NCCN-AML,  2019).  Likewise,  the  presence  of  complex  or  monosomal  karyotypes  in  AML  is  an  important 
prognostic factor associated with extremely poor prognosis (Döhner, 2017; NCCN-AML, 2019).  
The risk stratification criteria outlined by the ELN are used to determine which patients should be considered 
for allogeneic HSCT. In general, patients with favorable risk receive postinduction consolidation therapy and 
are generally not referred for transplantation unless there is evidence of conventional chemotherapy failure. In 
contrast, patients with adverse risk are known to have poor outcome despite intensive chemotherapy and are 
generally  referred  for  HSCT  if  remission  is  achieved,  a  suitable  donor  is  available,  and the  patient  does  not 
have serious comorbidities. The incidence of adverse genetics increases with age, so that they are frequently 
encountered in older patients who more often have comorbidities and poor performance status, and thus are 
not candidates for intensive remission induction therapy and HSCT. Therefore, prognosis for AML is generally 
inferior for older patients, resulting in less discriminatory relevance of molecular risk markers (Döhner, 2017). 
Minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  is  an  important  prognostic  factor  to  monitor  after  diagnosis  and  following 
remission as the presence of MRD identifies patients at high risk of disease recurrence and short survival. The 
ELN  recommendations  include  a  proposal  for  a  response  category  based  on  MRD  status  since  despite 
morphologic remission, patients frequently have evidence of persisting MRD as assessed by flow cytometric 
(multiparameter flow cytometry [MFC]) or quantitative molecular methods that include real-time quantitative 
PCR (RT-qPCR), digital PCR, and next-generation sequencing-based technologies. Minimal residual disease can 
be assessed at early time points, for example, following induction and consolidation to assess remission status 
and  determine  kinetics  of  disease  response,  and  sequentially  beyond  consolidation  to  detect  impending 
morphologic relapse. (Döhner, 2017). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
AML  is  a  heterogeneous  disease;  the  classification  is  based  on  morphologic,  cytogenetic,  molecular,  and 
immunophenotypic features, which, along with baseline patient characteristics such as age and performance 
status (PS), influence outcome and treatment recommendations (4). Among these, baseline cytogenetic risk 
constitutes one of the most significant prognostic markers of disease outcome (5). Age is the most prominent 
patient-specific risk factor, and cytogenetics the most disease-specific risk factor. 
In  AML,  leukaemic  blasts  replace  normal  blood  cells  in  bone  marrow  and  peripheral  blood,  which  leads  to 
anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. This is associated with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, 
disturbed wound healing, infections and bleedings. If left untreated, AML results in death within a few weeks 
to months. 
Long-term survival in adult patients with AML is only 35% to 40% for patients ≤60 years of age, and drops to 
5% to 15% in patients who are >60 years of age. (6) The majority of patients with AML will have relapsed 
disease within 3 years. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The  usual  treatments  for  newly  diagnosed  AML  patients  without  serious  comorbidities  include  intensive 
chemotherapy  to  induce  remission  (induction  chemotherapy).  Intensive  induction  chemotherapy  typically 
consists of cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline. In order to deepen the level of remission through 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 9/101 
 
 
 
eradication of residual leukemia, patients typically receive consolidation chemotherapy. There is no consensus 
regarding the optimal approach to the number of cycles of consolidation therapy. 
The therapeutic approaches for patients who can tolerate intensive therapy are usually divided into two phases: 
induction  of  remission  and  post-remission  (consolidation)  therapy.  Although  patients  can  achieve  CR  and 
disease control after induction, patients who do not receive post remission consolidation therapy are more likely 
to relapse, usually within 6 to 9 months. Post remission therapy is recommended for patients younger than 60 
years old and for older patients who are fit for intensive therapy. 
For patients who cannot tolerate intensive induction therapy, combinations of low intensity therapy with novel 
agents such as venetoclax and glasdegib has shown improved responses and/or survival. 
Allogeneic HSCT is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with AML. However, HSCT is not a feasible 
treatment option for many patients, and the frequency of patients undergoing HSCT decreases with increasing 
age  due  to  the  increased  prevalence  of  comorbidities  and  poor  organ  function  limiting  the  benefit-risk 
assessment  of  the  procedure.  Despite  treatment  with  consolidation  chemotherapy,  and  even  HSCT,  relapse 
rates after these therapies remain high and contribute to the poor outcomes in AML. Salvage therapy following 
relapse is limited, particularly for patients who are not candidates for transplant. Intensive chemotherapy can 
offer the highest CR rates; however, its application is limited by tolerability, in particular, the high treatment-
related mortality and short remission duration. 
Maintenance therapy conducive to long-term tolerable drug administration could potentially prolong remission 
and survival in the post
consolidation setting, particularly in those with intermediate risk and high-risk disease 
‐
as well as those who do not proceed to transplant. Despite the approval of several maintenance therapies for 
AML, given the lack of convincing benefit, maintenance therapy with these agents is globally not considered 
standard of care. Effective maintenance therapy could provide an important therapeutic approach to treatment 
of patients with AML, a disease associated with short survival and a high unmet medical need. 
Current salvage therapy at time of relapse is inadequate, particularly for subjects not eligible for transplant. 
Duration of first Complete Remission (CR) is an important predictor of outcome, with longer duration of first 
CR associated with better survival. Therefore, maintaining patients in CR is an important therapeutic goal in 
AML. As most patients will relapse, effective maintenance treatment for patients who do attain remission may 
play a role in preventing relapse and prolonging OS, especially in those for whom HSCT is not feasible.  
Maintenance Therapies Approved in the European Union: 
- Rydapt (midostaurin) was approved in the EU in 2017 as maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed patients 
with AML with FLT3 mutation, in first remission following midostaurin in combination with standard daunorubicin 
and  cytarabine  induction  and  high-dose  cytarabine  consolidation  chemotherapy,  based  on  a  Phase  3  trial 
(RATIFY; Stone, 2017). In this study, 717 newly diagnosed patients with FLT3 mutant AML aged 18 to 59 years 
old,  were  randomized  to  receive  standard  chemotherapy  (induction  and  consolidation)  in  combination  with 
either the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin (N = 360) or placebo (N = 357). Patients who achieved remission after 
consolidation therapy entered the maintenance phase and received midostaurin (N = 120) or placebo (N = 85) 
for an additional 12 months. The primary endpoint was OS, measured from time of randomization to death. 
Both OS and event-free survival (EFS) were significantly longer in patients treated with midostaurin compared 
with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; p = 0.009 for OS and 0.002 for EFS). Although there was a significant 
increase in OS, the specific contribution of maintenance midostaurin is not certain, as the maintenance portion 
of the study was neither randomized nor powered to determine the effect of midostaurin in maintenance setting. 
Additionally,  the  inclusion  of  midostaurin  with  induction  treatment  prior  to  maintenance,  did  not  allow  for 
determination of the independent effect of maintenance therapy. And lastly, midostaurin is targeted against

FLT3  mutant  AML  and  therefore,  it’s  use  is  limited  to  this  patient  population,  which  comprises  30%  of  AML 
cases (Kindler, 2010). 
- Ceplene (histamine dihydrochloride [HDC]), in combination with IL-2, was approved in the EU/EEA in 2010 
as maintenance therapy for adult patients with AML in first remission based on an open label randomized Phase 
3 study (Brune, 2006). The study enrolled patients ≥ 18 years old with de novo or secondary AML with verified 
CR following induction and consolidation chemotherapy. A total of 320 patients were enrolled; 261 patients in 
first remission and 59 patients in subsequent remission. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either HDC/IL-
2  for  10  consecutive  3-week  cycles  or  no  treatment  (control)  for  a  total  of  18  months  or  until 
relapse/discontinuation. Median age was 55 years old (18 to 81) and 54 years old (18 to 84) in the HDC/IL-2 
and  control  arms,  respectively.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  duration  of  leukemia-free  survival  (LFS). 
The study demonstrated significant improvement in LFS (HR = 0.71; p = 0.01) particularly in the subgroup of 
patients in first CR (HR = 0.69; p = 0.01) but not for patients in subsequent CR (HR = 0.79; p = 0.4); however, 
OS was not significantly improved neither in the overall population (p = 0.2) nor in the subgroups of patients 
in first or subsequent CR (p = 0.2 and > 0.5, respectively). The results of this study may have been confounded 
by the fact that 18% of patients enrolled were beyond first remission and 21% were enrolled > 6 months after 
achieving CR. Also, the study was not powered for differences in OS. In addition, the efficacy of HDC/IL-2 as 
maintenance in patients older than 60 years old has not been fully demonstrated. 
In  summary,  while  both  treatments  have  been  approved  in  the  maintenance  setting  in  the  EU,  Rydapt  and 
Ceplene have not been adopted by ELN for use in AML. This is due to limitations in the data as well as challenges 
to the use of the agents (e.g., patient population, study design limitations and side effects). 
The  injectable  form  of  azacitidine  –  Vidaza  (azacitidine),  is  approved  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for  the 
treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with: 
- 
- 
intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative 
disorder, 
-  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to WHO 
classification, 
-  AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. 
About the product 
Onureg is an oral formulation of azacitidine. Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and epigenetic 
modifier.  
Azacitidine  is  incorporated  into  DNA  and  RNA  following  cellular  uptake  and  enzymatic  biotransformation  to 
nucleotide  triphosphates.  Incorporation  of  azacitidine  into  the  DNA  of  cancer  cells,  including  acute  myeloid 
leukemia cells, modified epigenetic pathways through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, reduction of 
DNA  methylation,  and  alteration  of  gene  expression,  including  re-expression  of  genes  regulating  tumor 
suppression, immune pathways, cell cycle, and cell differentiation.  
Incorporation  of  azacitidine  into  the  RNA  of  cancer  cells,  including  leukemic  cells,  inhibited  RNA 
methyltransferase, reduced RNA methylation, decreased RNA stability, and decreased protein synthesis. Anti-
leukemic activity of azacitidine was demonstrated by reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in

acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines in vitro. In vivo, azacitidine decreased tumor burden and increased 
survival in leukemic tumor models. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, Antimetabolites, Pyrimidine analogues 
Onureg  is  indicated  as  maintenance  therapy  in  adult  patients  with  acute  myelogenous  leukemia  (AML)  who 
achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following 
induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment, and who are not candidates, including those who 
choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
The proposed starting dose is 300 mg orally, once daily (QD) for the first 14 days of each 28-day cycle.   
In the case of disease relapse during therapy with 5% to 15% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, in 
conjunction with clinical assessment, the dosing schedule indicates that it may be extended from 14 days to 
21 days of repeated 28-day cycles.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  azacitidine  is  (2R,3R,4S,5R)-4-amino-1-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-
furan-yl)-1H-[1,3,5]triazin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula C8H12N4O5. It has a molecular mass 
of 244.207 g/mol and the following structure:

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The  chemical  structure  of  azacitidine  was  elucidated  by  a  combination  of  elemental  analysis,  mass 
spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active 
substance  were  measured  by  single  crystal  X-ray  analysis,  X-ray  powder  diffraction,  differential  scanning 
calorimetry and thermo-gravimetric analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white solid, it is non-hygroscopic and highly soluble in aqueous media 
across a wide range of pH. 
Azacitidine  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  four  chiral  centres.  The  chirality  of  azacitidine 
originates from the ribose moiety of the molecule. Enantiomeric purity of D-ribose starting material is controlled 
during its synthesis. 
Polymorphism  has  been  observed  for  azacitidine.  Nine  different  solid  forms  of  azacitidine  were  identified, 
including eight crystalline forms and one amorphous form. Form I was determined to be the thermodynamically 
most stable form at ambient conditions. The validated active substance manufacturing process has consistently 
produced azacitidine Form I as the used solvent system (2-propanol/DMSO) generated pure Form I only, and 
no  other  polymorphs  were  generated  during  polymorph  studies  in  this  solvent  system.  Polymorphic  form  is 
routinely tested during active substance release. The solid form of the active substance remained unchanged 
during finished product manufacturing process. In addition, no form conversion was observed in tablet stability 
samples. 
The  full  information  on  the  active  substance  was  provided  in  the  submitted  dossier.  Azacitidine  is  a  known 
active substance, included in the centrally authorised medicinal product Vidaza (azacitidine 25 mg/mL powder 
for suspension for injection). In respect to manufacture of azacitidine, it is declared by the applicant that the 
information is the same as for currently authorised Vidaza MA except for the inclusion of an additional testing 
site for the active substance for physical properties (XRPD and PSD) and the reference to manufacturing site 
for starting materials. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Azacitidine is manufactured by two suppliers who use an identical manufacturing process and it is synthesized 
in a convergent synthesis in seven chemical transformation and a purification step using well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Three processes for the manufacture of azacitidine have been used during clinical development in producing 
both  pilot  scale  and  production-scale  batches.  These  processes  are  designated  as  Processes  A,  B,  and  C. 
Manufacturing Process C is the commercial active substance manufacturing process. All three processes use 
the following sequence of reactions. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified.  
The  quality  of  the  active  substance  used  in  the  various  phases  of  the  development  is  considered  to  be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, colour, identification (FT-IR, HPLC), solid 
form (XRPD), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (LAL), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), water content 
(KF) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  on  1  pilot  and  19  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  provided.  The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from two pilot scale an three commercial scale batches of active substance from the manufacturer 
used during the development only stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long 
term conditions (5°C ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 60% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability  data  from  eleven  commercial  scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  the  proposed  commercial 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5°C 
± 3°C) according to the ICH guidelines were provided in addition. 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of active substance from the second proposed commercial 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5°C 
± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were also provided.

The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  water  content,  microbial  limits,  assay  and  related 
substances. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested 
parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, showing that azacitidine is 
not photosensitive. 
Results on stress conditions (thermal, light, oxidation, acid, and base) were also provided on one batch. It was 
shown that azacitidine is sensitive to thermal and oxidative stress and acid and base hydrolysis, but it is stable 
under light exposure. 
An evaluation of polymorphic stability was performed on three active substance batches up to 48 months under 
long-term storage conditions and up to 6 months under accelerated storage conditions. The data demonstrate 
that no changes in polymorphic form were observed under any of the conditions studied for the duration of the 
evaluation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a solid oral immediate release dosage form - film-coated tablets 
containing either 200 or 300 mg of azacitidine. Onureg 200 mg film-coated tablets are pink, 17.0 x 7.6 mm 
in size, debossed with “200” on one side and “ONU” on the other side. Onureg 300 mg film-coated tablets are 
brown, oval, 19.0 x 9.0 mm in size, debossed with “300” on one side and “ONU” on the other side. The two 
strengths differ in size, colour and debossing. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) is presented. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk assessment to 
identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. A risk analysis was performed 
using  the  failure  mode  effect  analysis  (FMEA)  method  in  order  to  define  critical  process  steps  and  process 
parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was 
based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on 
the  experience  from  formulation  development,  process  design  and  scale-up  studies.  The  critical  process 
parameters have been adequately identified.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Azacitidine is shown to be compatible with excipients based on excipient compatibility studies and stability data 
for the intended commercial formulation.

The  primary  packaging  is  nylon  (OPA)  /  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  aluminium  blisters  with  push  through 
aluminium foil. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  four  main  steps:  dry  blending,  tablet  compression,  film  coating  and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The validation consisted 
of  three  consecutive  batches  of  200  mg  dosage  strength  and  four  consecutive  batches  of  300  mg  dosage 
strength  utilizing  the  proposed  commercial  process  and  scale  and  using  active  substance  provided  by  both 
manufacturers. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed PARs. Design space and regulatory flexibility has not been claimed. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications shown in Table 7 include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance,  identification  (HPLC-UV,  UV),  assay  (HPLC-UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC), 
degradation  products  (HPLC-UV),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.,  HPLC),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  limits 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The  potential  presence  of  elemental  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been  assessed  on  a  risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed 
considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and  answers  for  marketing 
authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004 
referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/409815/2020)  and  the  “Assessment 
report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk  was 
identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related  finished 
product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  on  six  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from 4 commercial scale batches per strength of finished product (3 manufactured by the first 
active substance supplier and 1 by the second) stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging representative of the one proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution  and  microbial  limits.  The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Neither significant changes nor trends have been observed. 
Stressed studies were conducted for the finished product under acidic, basic, oxidative, thermal/humidity, and 
light conditions. Under all conditions, the finished product assay and degradation product methods achieved 
adequate  resolution  of  all  degradation  peaks.  Acceptable  mass  balance  was  obtained  for  all  conditions 
evaluated. The finished product assay and degradation product methods are considered stability-indicating. 
In  addition,  one  batch  per  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No degradation products were detected in the finished product 
in the intended commercial package. Based on these results, the finished product is not light sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable. This medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. 
Adventitious agents

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  data  submitted  in  this  MAA  application  are  based  on  applicant-sponsored  studies, 
bibliographical information, and NCI-sponsored studies.  Most of the non-clinical studies were conducted in the 
1960s  and  1970s  before  the  introduction  of  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  regulations  and  International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Most of the primary pharmacodynamics studies presented in this application derive from data published in the 
literature, some of them since many decades.  
Experimental  evidence  suggests  that  azacitidine  acts  through  several  mechanisms  of  action,  among  which 
demethylation of DNA and cytotoxicity appear to be the prevailing ones. Anti-leukemic activity of azacitidine 
was demonstrated by reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in AML cell lines in vitro. 
Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine that inhibits DNA/RNA methyltransferases. Azacitidine 
is  incorporated  into  DNA  and  RNA  following  cellular  uptake  and  enzymatic  biotransformation  to  nucleotide 
triphosphates.  The  primary  pharmacodynamic  effects  are  inhibition  of  DNA  methyltransferases,  reduction  of 
DNA  methylation  and  induction  of  cytotoxicity.  Incorporation  of  azacitidine  into  the  RNA  of  cancer  cells, 
including leukemic cells, inhibits RNA methyltransferases, reduces RNA methylation, decreases RNA stability 
and decreases protein synthesis. In populations of proliferating cells, each generation of cells is expected to 
have  less  5-methycytosine  leading  to  expression  of  genes  previously  suppressed  by  hypermethylation.  
Hypermethylation of tumor suppression genes has been correlated with several leukemias and solid tumors in 
humans.  The capacity of azacitidine to inhibit DNA methylation in tumor cells is expected to cause these cells 
to  progress  to  their  normal  differentiated  phenotype.    The  doses  of  azacitidine  required  to  inhibit  DNA 
methylation are generally several fold less than the maximum doses previously used to treat AML. 
The applicant included reports investigating the in vivo pharmacology of azacitidine delivered by intraperitoneal 
injection. In vivo, azacitidine decreased tumor burden and increased survival in leukemic tumor models. 
In this frame, the applicant has justified how these data can be interpreted with respect to the intended oral 
formulation since differences between routes of administration have not introduced any significant variability 
or bias in the results of the non-clinical pharmacology studies. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021

Azacitidine can have immunosuppressive and antimicrobial effects (Hanka, 1966; Paluska, 1982; Vadlamudi, 
1970). It is acknowledged that these secondary effects are similar to those associated with other nucleoside 
analogues used as antiviral and antineoplastic agents.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The applicant has provided non-clinical GLP-compliant in vivo safety pharmacology studies testing IV azacitidine 
on central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In single dose safety pharmacology studies 
in rats, azacitidine produced different central nervous system (CNS)-related clinical signs and altered several 
respiratory functional parameters at a dose that was comparable to the lethal dose in 10% of the rats (LD10).  
Thus, azacitidine-related effects on CNS and respiratory parameters were attributed to its toxicity.  
An  in  vivo  safety  pharmacology  study  in  dogs  receiving  azacitidine  reported  increased  QTc  interval,  but 
interpretation of this study is limited by confounding effects associated with systemic toxicities of azacitidine. 
Follow-up  non-clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  and  include  in  vitro  studies  to  assess  the  vasodilatory 
potential in the isolated rat aorta, potential for chronotropic effects in the isolated guinea pig atria, and effects 
on  heart  rate  and  contractility  in isolated  perfused guinea  pig  hearts.    In  these  studies,  no  direct  effects  of 
azacitidine were observed on vasodilatory parameters on the isolated rat aorta, no positive chronotropic effect 
was observed on the pacemaker activity of the guinea pig right atria, although a weak negative chronotropic 
effect  was  seen  at  the  highest  concentration,  and  there  was  no  effect  on  heart  rate  and  contractility  in  the 
isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In  animals,  azacitidine  was  rapidly  absorbed  in  mouse,  rat,  and  dog  following  SC  or  PO  administration.  
Azacitidine presents poor PO bioavailability in the range of (22-38%) in the rats, mice and dog. There were no 
consistent  gender  differences  observed  following  PO  administration.  Following  multiple  PO  doses,  no 
accumulation was observed, which was consistent with the short t1/2 (< 1 hour) of azacitidine.  
Studies showed that azacitidine has a wide tissue distribution following SC or IV administration to rats, and IV 
or PO administration to mice. Other than the excretion/metabolic and gastrointestinal system, relatively higher 
azacitidine-related radioactivity was present in spleen, bone marrow and thymus. The radioactivity in tissues 
declined steadily over time. Azacitidine penetrates also into CSF and brain following IV or PO administration to 
rats. Plasma protein binding of azacitidine suggests that the in vitro protein binding of azacitidine in human 
serum is low. 
Azacitidine  is  not  metabolized  by  cytochrome  P450  isozymes  (CYPs).  Metabolism  of  azacitidine  is  by 
spontaneous hydrolysis and by deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase (CDA). In vitro and in vivo studies 
have demonstrated that while there were some quantitative differences, spontaneous hydrolysis of azacitidine 
is  the  major  pathway  in  different  species,  regardless  of  the  route  of  administration.  Although  quantitative 
differences  have  been  observed,  no  qualitative  difference  in  metabolite  profiles  have  been  observed  among 
species. CDA is the primary pathway for the breakdown of azacitidine to the less active, 5-azauridine. Levels 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021

of  cytidine  deaminase  activity  in  blood  varies  greatly  among  mammalian  species  and  this  may  explain  the 
greater sensitivity of dogs and rodents to azacitidine compared to humans. Although a limited number of case 
reports correlated CDA polymorphisms to changes in the clinical outcome of azacitidine therapy, this evidence 
remains limited and do not constitute a definite proof that pharmacogenomics can significantly impact on the 
efficacy and safety of azacitidine.  
Urine  was  the  major  excretion  route  of  radioactivity  in  mice  and  rats  following  PO,  SC  or  IV  dose  of  14C-
azacitidine. Similar excretion profiles were observed with the IV and SC administration to rats. The parent drug 
accounted for a small portion of urinary radioactivity (approximately ≤ 5%).  
In  vitro,  azacitidine  was  not  an  inducer  or  inhibitor  of  CYPs  at  clinically  achievable  plasma  concentrations. 
Hence, azacitidine will not produce clinically relevant PK drug-drug interactions due to CYP enzyme inhibition 
or induction when co-administered with CYP substrates, inducers, or inhibitors. 
Azacitidine was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). At 50 μM, azacitidine had no notable inhibitory effect 
on the transport of digoxin. CC-486 was not an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic 
anion  transporters  (OAT)  OAT1  and  OAT3,  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptides  (OATP)  OATP1B1  and 
OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2. Therefore, azacitidine is unlikely to produce any clinically 
relevant interactions with substrates of these transporters, or an inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.  
Uptake of azacitidine was mediated by all 7 human nucleoside transporters (hCNT1, hCNT2, hCNT3, hENT1, 
hENT2, hENT3, and hENT4) tested, with hCNT3 showing the highest activity.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The applicant presented single dose toxicity studies conducted in rodents in 1970s and early 1980s according 
to the guidelines and standards of that period (non-GLP compliant).  Single-dose studies were conducted in 
mice, rats, and dogs using PO, IP, and IV routes of administration.

Non-GLP 
Toxicokinetic data 
Kinetics of azacitidine after a single dose were evaluated in a 2-day and repeat dose 14-day oral studies in 
dogs.  
Some variability is observed in the plasma concentrations between males and females but no gender differences 
are observed following PO administration. Systemic exposure increases with increasing dose with little evidence 
of accumulation following repeated administration. 
The  applicant  records  the  no  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  to  be  0.2  mg/kg/day,  while  mean  steady-state 
exposure (AUC) at this dose level was 0.223 h*ug/ml in females and 0.148 h*ng/ml in males. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies have been conducted in rabbits and hamsters. The studies are summarized as follows: 
Study RIPS-CIPA-102816-13-76: One, 3, and 9% azacitidine in 1% methyl cellulose was applied to the skin 
of New  Zealand White rabbits. The application sites were cleaned with water 24 hours after application and 
examined after 30 minutes, 48 hours, and 72 hours later including microscopic evaluation at 72 hours. Mild 
skin irritation reported at a concentration of 9 % of azacitidine by Draize method.  
Study  PH-43-65-61:  Azacitidine  up  tot  concentrations  of  21  mg/ml  in  Sudak's  buffer  applied  topically  to 
hamster cheek pouches caused a slight temporary stickiness of white blood cells to endothelium, and venous 
blood flow was also reduced for a short time (5-6 min.). 
Intravenous administration of azacitidine (up to 250 mg/kg) in the jugular vein induced a moderate to severely 
reduction in the arteriole and venule blood flow, but there was no evidence of thromboembolism. 
Study  ADL-NCI-72-38:  Azacitidine  formulated  with  polyvinylpyrrolidone  (PVP)  in  Sudak's  buffer  (3.5-20 
mg/ml)  applied  topically  to  hamster  cheek  pouches  temporarily  reduced  arteriole  and  venule  blood  at  all 
concentrations  tested.  There  was  no  evidence  of  thromboembolism,  also  no  stickiness  of  leukocytes  was 
observed.

I.v. injections up to 125 mg/kg in PVP/ Sudak's buffer induced slight to severe reduction sin venule blood flow, 
and  moderate  to  severe  reduction  in  arteriole  flow.  The  effects  were  immediate  and  transitory. 
Thromboembolism was not seen.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has presented a non-clinical package consisting mainly of studies reported in published literature, 
accompanied by sponsored studies. It has to be noted that most of the non-clinical studies were conducted in 
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s prior to the implementation of International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. Hence, there are intrinsic flaws in the non-clinical 
data presented due to the lack of details available concerning the quality of information gathered. However, 
given the extensive clinical experience and the overall reliability of the pre-clinical package, the absence of GLP 
compliance is accepted.

Although the submitted toxicity data deviates from the guidelines at several points, there are extensive clinical 
experiences on azacitidine toxicities in humans.  Studies have been performed using the oral route in the data 
package submitted and although repeated dose studies were conducted, these were not completely in line with 
the proposed clinical use.   
Data on exposure was generally not available within the toxicity studies. The number of animals/sex/group was 
generally less than required for determining biological relevance of the findings. 
There are deficiencies in the non-clinical data, yet there are adequate clinical data to provide the insight on 
azacitidine toxicities in humans. Taken all together, systemic toxicity of azacitidine is adequately characterised 
with the results obtained in IV, IP and PO administration in sensitive animal species (dog and monkey). 
The results show that primary target organs of toxicity appear to be consistent between the studies. The largest 
limitation in the data package submitted from a toxicological perspective, is that unexpected toxicities due to 
prolonged exposure may have been missed by the submitted non-clinical studies; however, extensive clinical 
safety  data  of  azacitidine  adequately  supplemented  to  any  lack  of  unexpected  toxicities  in  animals  after 
prolonged exposures. 
Toxicity was reported in the lymphoid system, bone marrow, liver, gland/lumen dilation and single cell necrosis 
in mucosal crypts of small and large intestines and/or centrilobular hepatocellular vacuolation.  Possible toxicity 
of the kidneys cannot be ruled out.  Deaths reported, occurred several days up to several weeks after start of 
treatment. Generally toxic effects were reversible with recovery evident in surviving animals.  In the repeated 
dose studies severe toxicity was seen at doses lower than the approved oral azacitidine dose in humans.  An 
explanation for this difference could be that there might be a higher exposure in the test animals due to reduced 
activity  of  the  enzyme,  cytidine  deaminase,  compared  to  humans.  Cytidine  deaminase  is  involved  in  the 
deamination of azacitidine which is the primary pathway for the breakdown of azacitidine.  
Non concerning variability has been reported in the plasma concentrations of male and female dogs, but the 
data indicate that there are no gender differences observed following PO administration. Some slight differences 
in toxic effect in dogs between males and females were reported, however these are minor and not of a concern.  
Genotoxicity studies cited in this dossier were not in accordance with current ICH guideline, but all the data 
indicate that azacitidine induces gene mutations and chromosome aberrations in vitro. There were no in vivo 
genotoxicity/clastogenicity studies. 
Despite  several  gaps  in  the  design  of  the  studies  (low  animal  number,  non-GLP)  the  genotoxicity  studies 
indicate that azacitidine is a potential carcinogen.  Azacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal 
aberrations in bacterial and mammalian cell systems in vitro. The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was 
evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when 
administered  intraperitoneally  3  times  per  week  for  52  weeks.  An  increased  incidence  of  tumours  in  the 
lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine administered 
intraperitoneally  for  50  weeks.  A  tumorigenicity  study  in  rats  revealed  an  increased  incidence  of  testicular 
tumours.  The  data  also  suggest  that  low  doses  of  azacitidine  can  even  induce  skin  tumours  (especially 
squamous cell carcinomas).  
Single  doses  of  azacitidine  can  be  embryolethal  and  teratogenic  in  rats  and  mice  when  given  during 
organogenesis. Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death 
(increased  resorption)  after  a  single  IP  injection  of  azacitidine  during  organogenesis.  Developmental 
abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before closure of the hard palate. 
In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse reactions when given pre implantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic

when given during organogenesis. Foetal abnormalities during organogenesis in rats included: Central nervous 
system  (CNS)  anomalies  (exencephaly/encephalocele),  limb  anomalies  (micromelia,  club  foot,  syndactyly, 
oligodactyly)  and  others  (microphthalmia,  micrognathia,  gastroschisis,  oedema,  and  rib  abnormalities) (See 
SmPC Section 5.3) 
Also,  paternal  treatment  with  azacitidine  resulted  in  dose-dependent  effects  on  spermatogenesis  and 
subsequent progeny outcome at doses causing no/low systemic toxic effects. Administration of azacitidine to 
male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during 
subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the 
testes  and  epididymides,  decreased  sperm  counts,  decreased  pregnancy  rates,  an  increase  in  abnormal 
embryos and increased loss of embryos in mated females (See SmPC section 5.3). 
The potential risk of developmental toxicity for humans is unknown. Based on results from animal studies and 
its mechanism of action, Onureg is not recommended during pregnancy (See SmPC section 4.6).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of Onureg was investigated in 11 studies in subjects with hematologic malignancies (MDS, CMML, AML, 
lymphoma, or MM) at doses ranging from 120 mg to 600 mg and compared to the SC azacitidine starting dose 
of  75  mg/m2.  Based  on  data  from  these  studies,  oral  azacitidine  PK  characteristics  in  terms  of  absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) were determined. Intrinsic factors (age, gender, race, weight, 
renal and hepatic labs) and their impact on azacitidine PK were assessed by Population PK (PopPK) modelling 
(CC-486-MPK-001), which included 286 subjects with 1933 concentration records from studies AZA-MDS-004, 
CC-486-CAGEN-001, and CC-486-AML-001. 
Absorption  
The PK of azacitidine following IV and SC administration has been previously characterized and demonstrated 
rapid and nearly complete absorption of azacitidine following SC administration with Tmax occurring within 30 
minutes and a bioavailability of 89% relative to IV administration. Similarly, absorption of azacitidine after oral 
administration was rapid,  with Cmax occurring at approximately 1-hour post-dose. The area under the curve 
(AUC)  generally  increased  with  dose,  although  high  inter-subject  variability  in  azacitidine  exposures  was 
observed (percent coefficient of variation [%CV] range of 30 to 74%). The Cmax and AUC parameters are further 
corroborated  by  PopPK  analysis.  No  accumulation  of  azacitidine  is  observed  after  multiple  doses.  Oral 
bioavailability  relative  to  subcutaneous  administration  was  11.5%  at  a  dose  of  360  mg  for  Formulation  F6, 
which was chosen for further clinical development.   
During the biopharmaceutic development related to absorption and formulation development 3 primary tablet 
formulations  were  used:  F6,  F8,  and  F9  (F9  being  the  market  image).  Bioavailability  with  respect  to  SC 
administration was used as a guide for formulation development.  
Final market image formulation F9 has been shown to be bioequivalent to earlier formulation F8 used in earlier 
clinical trials, thus validating the formulation development process. 
No clinically meaningful change in the PK of azacitidine was observed upon oral administration with a high-fat, 
high-calorie meal, thus, CC-486 can be taken with or without food. Absorption of azacitidine is not affected by 
changes in gastric pH; no dose modification is required when co-administered with a PPI or other pH modulators 
(AZA-MDS-004).  
Distribution 
Following  oral  administration,  the  geometric  mean  apparent  volume  of  distribution  of  azacitidine  (V/F) 
determined directly in one study is 881 L (12.6 L/kg for a 70 kg person) at a dose of 300 mg further confirmed 
by PopPK analysis (889L)The plasma protein binding of azacitidine is approximately 6-12% and independent 
of azacitidine concentrations.

EMA/308711/2021 
Page 41/101 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
From early radiotracer studies in patients with advanced cancer following both IV and SC administration, the 
kidneys excrete azacitidine and/or its metabolites, with 50% to 100% of the injected radioactivity recovered in 
urine over a 48- to 72-hour period after dosing. 
The mean terminal half-life of azacitidine after oral administration of 300 mg is approximately 0.5 hours (similar 
to that after IV [0.36 hours] and SC [0.69 hours] dosing). The geometric mean apparent clearance is 1242 L/h 
(CC-486-CAGEN-001).  
The following Table 15 summarises the main PK parameters from oral azacitidine. 
Table 8: CC-486 Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following 300mg Dose (Geometric 
Mean, Geometric %CV) 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In general, and despite the large variability, oral Azacitidine PK seems to show linearity in doses between 120 
mg  and  600  mg.  With  a  mean  elimination  half-life  of  azacitidine  after  oral  administration  ranging  from 
approximately 0.5 to 1 hour, there is no accumulation in a once daily regime. However, the drug is administered 
during 14 to 21 days in a 28 days cycle.  
Based  on  data  from  different  routes  of  administration  and  formulations,  showing  a  lack  of  relevant  PK 
differences between days of treatment, there is no time dependency in azacitidine PK, in line with the fact that 
cytidine deaminase is not known to be induced and there are not many examples of its inhibition.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 42/101 
 
 
 
 
The influence of renal impairment on the PK of azacitidine was evaluated in six cancer subjects with normal 
renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min) and six subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) following 
daily SC dosing at 75 mg/m2/day (AZA PH US 2007 PK 006). Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine 
exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. Moreover, 
creatinine clearance was identified as a significant covariate on CL/F of CC-486 in the final PopPK model.   
Impaired hepatic function 
A clinical study to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on oral azacitidine PK has not been conducted. 
PopPK analysis determined that AST (8 to 155 U/L) and ALT (5 to 185 U/L) did not have clinically meaningful 
effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine.  
Additional PopPK analysis was conducted according to the NCI-ODWG hepatic impairment criteria. The effect 
of  mild  hepatic  impairment  was  evaluated  and  did  not  improve  the  model  fitting  statistically,  and  therefore 
does not impact the clearance or exposure of azacitidine in a clinically relevant manner. 
Age, Body Weight, Gender and Race 
In a PopPK analysis based on cumulative data from 286 subjects who received oral azacitidine, intrinsic factors 
of gender, age (46 to 93 years), race (92% white), body mass index (BMI [15.7 to 51.7 kg/m2]) and body 
weight  (39.3  to  129  kg)  were  examined  and  shown  not  to  be  clinically  significant  covariates  influencing 
azacitidine  exposure.  As  a  limited  number  of  non-white  subjects  were  available  for  PopPK  analysis,  race 
covariate analysis results should be interpreted with caution. Only 2.3% of subjects in PopPK analysis were of 
Asian descent, and results from studies exploring the PK in and Asian-Pacific Island subjects were inconclusive 
due  to  high  variability  and  small  number  of  subjects  enrolled.  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  oral  azacitidine  in 
children aged 0-17 years have not yet been established.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro drug-drug interaction studies demonstrate that azacitidine is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor an inducer of CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5. Azacitidine is not 
metabolized  by  CYPs.  Hence  azacitidine  is  unlikely  to  have  any  clinically  relevant  interactions  when  co-
administered  with  CYP  substrates,  inducers  or  inhibitors.  No  UGT  inhibition  studies  were  performed  for 
azacitidine. However, none of the major elimination pathways of the azacitidine is direct glucuronidation. It is 
also  acknowledged  that  both  the  Cmax  and  exposure  are  low  and  elimination  is  very  fast.  Taking  into 
consideration  the  general  characteristics  of  the  UGT  enzymes,  and  also  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation of Drug/Drug Interactions, the lack of in vitro inhibition studies is acceptable as a relevant DDI 
interaction through UGT inhibition is unlikely to occur. Azacitidine is not a P-gp substrate or inhibitor and is 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 43/101 
 
 
 
 
 
unlikely  to  produce  any  clinically  relevant  interactions  with  P-gp.  Azacitidine  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 and is unlikely to interact with the substrates of these transporters. 
However,  a  decrease  in  CYP3A4/5  activity  was  observed  with  high  (100  uM)  concentrations  that  could  be 
explained  by  inhibition  of  protein  synthesis.  However,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that,  at  clinically  relevant 
concentrations (1 and 10 μM), the decrease in CYP3A activity was minimal (<13%). Therefore, the suppression 
of CYP3A by azacitidine is not clinically relevant. 
No  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  with  CC-486.  The  impact  of  concomitant 
medications on the PK of CC-486 was assessed as part of the Phase 1/2 study in subjects with AML and MDS 
post HSCT using standard PK sampling during dose escalation on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 (Study CC-486-AML-
002). Following administration of CC-486 (200 mg once daily [QD]), azacitidine plasma concentration profiles 
and  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  comparable  when  taken  with  or  without  concomitant  medications. 
Concomitant  medications  included  (but  were  not  limited  to)  prophylactic  antibiotics,  calcineurin  inhibitors, 
antifungals,  and  antiviral  agents;  anti-emetics  and  drugs  to  manage  gastrointestinal  complications;  other 
concomitant  treatments  included  RBC  and  platelet  transfusions  and  myeloid  growth  factors.  Although  the 
protocol did not isolate drugs nor allowed for a proper wash-out of the co-medication in order to convincingly 
isolate effects, the results suggest a lack of significant drug–drug interactions with CC-486 and concomitant 
medications  such  as  antibiotics,  anti-emetics,  or  other  drugs  commonly  administered  in  the  post-transplant 
setting. Based on the know disposition characteristics of azacitidine, without influence of the major elimination 
and transporters enzyme systems, this type of behaviour is expected. Co-administration of carboplatin or nab-
paclitaxel had minimal effect on CC 486 exposure,  suggesting that Azacitidine has no influence in the renal 
elimination process and no direct effect on CYP2C8 (Study AZA-ST-001).  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
N/A 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Azacitidine exerts its antineoplastic effects through multiple mechanisms. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA 
and RNA following cellular uptake and enzymatic biotransformation to nucleotide triphosphates. Azacitidine is 
similar to cytidine, which in turn is a building block of in the fundamental genetic material of cells (DNA and 
RNA). Azacitidine blocks the synthesis of DNA and RNA, and thus inhibits the growth of tumour cells. It also 
inhibits DNA methyltransferase and it is therefore believed to exert its antineoplastic effects also by causing 
hypomethylation  (demethylation)  of  DNA  as  well  as  by  direct  cytotoxicity  on  abnormal  bone  marrow 
haematopoietic cells (see also Fandy et al. Cancer J, 2007, 13:40-48). As genetic and epigenetic changes co-
operate in the pathobiology of AML and MDS, specifically, aberrant DNA hypermethylation in promoter regions 
of genes tends to silence gene expression, and therefore, reduced DNA methylation can lead to re-expression 
of genes altered in cancer cells. Deoxyribonucleic acid hypomethylation of these aberrantly methylated genes 
with azacitidine allows the re-expression of tumor suppressors, including genes involved in normal cell cycle 
regulation,  cell  differentiation  and  proliferation.  Azacitidine  also  exerts  antineoplastic  effects  by  epigenetic 
regulation  of  the  bone  marrow  microenvironment,  including  specific  immune-mediated  pathways  associated 
with innate and adaptive immunity.  In addition, azacitidine activates DNA damage and P53 response pathways 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 44/101 
 
 
 
causing cell death and apoptosis of abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Azacitidine incorporates 
into  RNA  to  decrease  ribonucleotide  reductase  M2  subunit  (RRM2)  expression  and  attenuates  RRM2  mRNA 
stability.  Azacitidine  inhibits  RNA:m5C  methyltransferases  to  limit  RNA  methylation,  decreases  protein 
synthesis, and induces cell cytotoxicity. 
The  rationale  for  the  application  of  inhibition  of  DNA  methylation,  with  substances  like  azacitidine,  was  the 
assumed  reversion  of  hypermethylation  induced  tumour  suppressor  gene-inactivation.  Since  high-risk  MDS 
shows  a  high  prevalence  of  tumour  suppressor  gene  hypermethylation  azacitidine  was  suggested  to  be 
beneficial in MDS. By re-establishing cell cycle control by effective suppressor genes antiproliferative signals 
could  be  restored  in  affected  cells.  This  mechanism  could  also  contribute  to  restoring  cell  differentiation 
pathways. In fact, azacitidine was claimed to restore gene transcription in cell lines with hypermethylated genes 
and  to  induce  a  modest  differentiation  of  transformed  myeloid  cell  lines  (Chim  et  al.  Hematol  Oncol,  2002, 
20:167-176). 
Whether the direct cytotoxic effects of azacitidine have any relationship with hypomethylation of DNA is yet 
unclear. In theory the alteration of suppressor gene activity could cause antiproliferative signals that negatively 
influence  the  normal  cell  cycle  (also  in  normal  haematopoietic  cells)  and  thereby  it  could  contribute  to  the 
myelotoxic adverse events. 
Azacitidine is cytotoxic to a wide range of tumor cell lines, with increased sensitivity across leukemic cells in 
vitro.  In  wild-type  mice,  intraperitoneal  administration  of  azacitidine  using  low  exposure,  extended  dose 
schedules exhibited higher RNA and DNA incorporation of radiolabeled azacitidine into PBMC and bone marrow 
relative  to  higher  exposure,  limited  duration  schedules.  In  vivo,  anti-leukemic  activity  of  azacitidine  was 
established  through  decreased  tumor  burden  and  increased  survival  in  mouse  leukemia  models.  Azacitidine 
causes  death  of  rapidly  dividing  cells  (Module  2;  Section  2.6.6),  including  cancer  cells  that  are  no  longer 
responsive  to  normal  growth  control  mechanisms.    Non-proliferating  cells  are  relatively  insensitive  to 
azacitidine.  Treatment with azacitidine can induce cellular differentiation by causing demethylation of genes 
silenced  by  hypermethylation.  Azacitidine-induced  demethylation  and  differentiation  persists  for  many  cell 
generations. In addition, hypermethylation of regions with dense CpG dinucleotides, referred to as CpG islands, 
spanning the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is commonly associated with cancers. The cause of 
aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands is unclear, but de novo methylation has been shown to increase with 
age.  Overexpression  of  DNA  methyltransferases  may  also  contribute  to  hypermethylation  of  CpG  islands. 
Although the relative importance of DNA hypomethylation as a mechanism of azacitidine’s antitumor activity 
against MDS and AML is not definitively established, recent trials have provided varied evidence relating clinical 
responses to azacitidine arising from its demethylating activity. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The  applicant  has  not  conducted  dedicated  PD  or  PK/PD  studies  for  this  submission,  but  rather  performed 
bridging PK, Efficacy and Safety studies with the oral administration of azacitidine. 
The  applicant  has  presented  a  literature  review  with  references  that  highlight  the  well-known  roles  of 
azacitidine. 
The primary pharmacodynamic properties of azacitidine are mediated through its incorporation into RNA and 
DNA, resulting in DNA hypomethylation as well as cytotoxicity in haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow of 
MDS and AML patients. Azacitidine exerts its antineoplastic effects through multiple mechanisms.  Incorporation

Page 45/101 
 
 
 
of azacitidine into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, reduction of DNA methylation, 
and alteration of gene expression, which can include re-expression of genes (including microRNAs) regulating 
tumor suppression, immune pathways, cell cycle, and cell differentiation.  
The relationship between these mechanisms of action, and the extent to which each is contributing to clinical 
activity in humans is not yet fully understood. Recent clinical trials with azacitidine have documented its ability 
to induce DNA hypomethylation in patients after administration, but their results are not consistent. 
The  applicant  has  provided  data  from  mainly  2  studies  in  which  pharmacodynamic  results  were  presented: 
Clinical Study AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 and Clinical Study AZA-ST-001 (Parts 1 and 2). 
Study AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 was a Phase 1, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD of oral 
azacitidine  in  subjects  with  MDS,  chronic  myelomonocytic  leukemia  (CMML)  or  AML.  The  pharmacodynamic 
parameters evaluated in this study were the changes in global and gene-specific DNA methylation following 
azacitidine administration. Possible relationships between PD variables, PK parameters, and subject responses 
were also considered for exploration. 
The  study  showed  evidence  of  methylation  reduction  of  highly  methylated  loci  following  SC  and  all  oral 
azacitidine treatment schedules, with an exposure-response relationship (further addressed in the respective 
section). The greatest extent of hypomethylation at cycle end was provided by 21-day 300-mg QD or 200-mg 
BID  dosing.  A  minimum  biologically  effective  plasma  exposure  of  approximately  100  ng·h  /mL  was  defined 
based on DNA methylation change at Day 15.

Table 10: Changes in Global DNA Methylation Score (GDMS) with Subcutaneous 
Azacitidine and Oral Azacitidine in 7-day or Extended (14-day and 21-day) Dosing 
Schedules 
The  Study  AZA-ST-001  (Parts  1  and  2)  evaluated  azacitidine  as  a  single  agent  and  in  combination  with 
carboplatin or ABI-007 in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. 
For the majority of subjects, a decrease in CpG methylation was observed following CC-486 treatment, with 
generally  larger  reductions  observed  in  Arm  C  subjects  and  generally  minor  reductions  observed  in  Arm  A 
subjects. 
Arm  A  treatment  evaluated  oral  azacitidine  in  combination  with  CBDCA  and  all  13  subjects  enrolled  had 
evaluable  PK.  Arm  B  evaluated  oral  azacitidine  in  combination  with  nab-paclitaxel  and  had  24  PK  evaluable 
subjects. Arm C evaluated oral azacitidine as a single agent and had 9 evaluable PK subjects. 
In part 2 of the study, variable reductions in GDMS were observed at Day 15 in whole blood samples, with 
generally larger reductions observed in Arm A and Arm C subjects and generally minor reductions observed in 
Arm B subjects. Reduction in GDMS was observed in tumor tissue from 1 NPC subject in Arm C at Day 15. 
Secondary pharmacology 
As an agent that incorporates into nucleic acids and alters gene expression, azacitidine also has the potential 
to  cause  harm.  In  addition  to  its  role  in  inhibition  of  DNA  methylation  and  induction  of  cell  differentiation, 
azacitidine  has  immunosuppressive,  antimicrobial,  genotoxic,  embryotoxic,  teratogenic,  and  carcinogenic 
effects. These secondary effects are in line with the pharmacologic activity of other pyrimidine analogues used 
as antiviral and antineoplastic agents.Also, azacitidine has the ability to express viral genes and antigens.   
Studies also demonstrate that azacitidine can reactivate latent viruses such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) in vitro 
(tissue culture), and can induce EBV antigen production in EBV+ patients.  Evidence for a direct relationship 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021

between  azacitidine  treatment  and  viral  infections  including  re-expression  or  assembly  of  the  entire  EBV 
genome (or virions) or an increase in lytic stages of viral replication cannot be established. . In addition, viral 
reactivation  is  currently  being  and  will  be  monitored  by  the  Applicant  through  routine  risk  evaluation in  the 
periodic safety update report (PSUR) for azacitidine, under the safety concern of infection in agreement with 
prior Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommendation. 
A dedicated QT study has not been conducted for CC-486 considering no clinically significant QTc prolongation 
has been observed with the injectable form (IV or SC) of azacitidine. In addition, the Cmax and AUC of azacitidine 
after  300  mg  oral  administration  was  approximately  75%  lower  than  when  given  SC  at  75  mg/m2, 
demonstrating  lower  daily  systemic  exposures  of  azacitidine  when  given  orally  at  clinically  relevant  doses 
compared to SC administration (AZA PH US 2008 CL008).  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No  formal  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  studies  have  been  performed  with  CC-486.  Although  some  data  has 
been presented for PK interactions, no PD interactions were mentioned in the clinical overview, clinical summary 
or clinical study reports. 
However, on the non-clinical summary some information was provided regarding potential pharmacodynamic 
interactions. 
Concurrent administration of azacitidine with other antineoplastic agents may affect the pharmacodynamics of 
either compound.  The interaction of azacitidine with other commonly used antineoplastic agents is frequently 
dependent on the dose, sequence, and schedule of administration.  The degree of tumor cell cytotoxicity with 
combination therapy may be antagonistic, additive, or synergistic.  The pharmacodynamic interactions between 
azacitidine and other antineoplastic agents are presented in the Table 18 below.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of azacitidine has been previously characterized (initially investigated in the 1970s following treatment 
of patients with the radiolabelled drug and clinical results published during the period 1989 to 2002) following 
both IV and SC administration and demonstrated rapid and nearly complete absorption of azacitidine following 
SC administration (Tmax occurred within 30 minutes and a bioavailability of 89% relative to IV administration), 
and  rapid  elimination  after  both  methods  of  administration  (t1/2  of  0.69  and  0.36  hours  for  SC  and  IV 
administration, respectively). 
Based  on  the  data  provided  for  oral  azacitidine,  it  can  be  concluded  that  azacitidine  undergoes  rapid  and 
possibly  complete  biotransformation  by  spontaneous  chemical  degradation  as  well  as  metabolism.  The 
metabolism appears not to be mediated by CYPs, UGTs, SULTs or GSTs, and it is suggested that metabolism 
proceeds via the cytosolic enzyme cytidine deaminase.  
Absorption of azacitidine is not affected by changes in gastric pH; no dose modification is required when co-
administered with a PPI or other pH modulators. Onureg can be administered with or without food (Study CC-
486-CAGEN-001).  
The  small  amount  recovered  in  the  urine  indicates  (2%  of  the  dose  administered  orally,  with  an  estimated 
absolute  bioavailability  of  ca.  11%)  that  non-renal  elimination  (e.g.,  metabolism,  hydrolysis,  and/or 
degradation) is the predominant pathway for parent azacitidine clearance. 
Azacitidine appears to have a high clearance, a short half-life drug with low oral bioavailability.  
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 52/101 
 
 
 
 
In summary, azacitidine pharmacokinetics following oral (as opposed to IV or SC administration, which are well 
established), has been scarcely studied in this dossier. The absence of a formal mass balance study precludes 
firm  conclusions  on  the  fate  of  the  drug  during  absorption.  However,  given  that  it  is  demonstrated  that 
azacitidine  undergoes  almost  complete  non-enzymatic  hydrolysis,  there  is  no  basis  to  require  a  new  mass 
balance study after oral administration in humans. No in vivo metabolism or metabolites PK have been studied. 
A PopPK study supported the main conclusions on special populations and drug/drug interactions. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Despite increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous 
administrations in six subjects with severe renal impairment, this increase in exposure was not correlated with 
an increase in adverse events and dose modification was not recommended in subjects with renal impairment  
Moreover, creatinine clearance was identified as a significant covariate on CL/F of oral azacitidine in the final 
PopPK model. However, due to the low oral bioavailability of azacitidine, no dose adjustment is recommended 
in renally-impaired subjects treated with 300 mg oral azacitidine.   
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is unlikely to 
affect the PK to a clinically relevant extent since azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination 
mediated  by  cytidine  deaminase.  A  population  PK  analysis  determined  that  AST  (8 to 155 U/L),  ALT 
(5 to 185 U/L) and mild hepatic impairment (BIL ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or BIL 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) 
did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of azacitidine. The effects of moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment (BIL > 1.5 × ULN and any AST) on the PK of azacitidine is unknown. 
Age, Body Weight, Gender and Race 
As a limited number of non-white subjects were available for PopPK analysis, race covariate analysis results 
should be interpreted with caution. Only 2.3% of subjects in PopPK analysis were of Asian descent, and results 
from studies exploring the PK in and Asian-Pacific Island subjects were inconclusive due to high variability and 
small  number  of  subjects  enrolled.  The  SmPC  includes  a  statement  in  Section  5.2  that  the  effects  of 
race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine is unknown.In general, gender, age (46 to 93 years), 
race (92% white), body mass index (BMI [15.7 to 51.7 kg/m2]) and body weight (39.3 to 129 kg) have shown 
not to be clinically significant covariates influencing azacitidine exposure.  
Interactions 
Appropriate conclusions have been drawn from the performed in vitro and in vivo studies. Azacitidine is not a 
substrate,  inhibitor  or  inducer  of  CYP  enzymes  and  transporters.  Therefore,  no  potential  for  inhibition  or 
inducing  effect  on  these  systems  exists.  Two  in  vivo  studies  support  the  non-existing  interaction  with 
concomitant medications such as antibiotics, antiemetics, or other drugs commonly administered in the post-
transplant  setting.  Moreover,  co-administration  of  carboplatin  or  nab-paclitaxel  had  minimal  effect  on  oral 
azacitidine exposure.

The applicant has provided a mixed clinical pharmacodynamics package, with literature references and clinical 
studies. The clinical pharmacodynamics summary was focused on the pharmacokinetic characterization of the 
oral  administration  of  azacitidine,  which  was  indeed  the  main  difference  regarding  the  already  approved 
medicine with injectable azacitidine. Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and epigenetic modifier. 
Azacitidine  is  incorporated  into  DNA  and  RNA  following  cellular  uptake  and  enzymatic  biotransformation  to 
nucleotide triphosphates. Incorporation of azacitidine into the DNA of AML cells, modified epigenetic pathways 
through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, and reduction of DNA methylation. This led to alteration of 
gene expression, including re-expression of genes regulating tumour suppression, immune pathways, cell cycle, 
and cell differentiation. Incorporation of azacitidine into the RNA of AML cells, inhibited RNA methyltransferase, 
reduced RNA methylation, decreased RNA stability, and decreased protein synthesis. 
The  applicant  has  presented  data  from  studies  in  which  pharmacodynamic  parameters  were  evaluated. 
However, the clinical guidelines for diagnosis and follow-up of acute myeloid leukemia present as one of the 
pivotal measurements the percentage of blasts. Other than the studies in which efficacy endpoints (OS and 
RFS)  were  being  evaluated,  the  PD  endpoints  studied  were  mainly  related  to  measurement  of  methylation. 
Although it is recognized that cell methylation is an endpoint directly related to the mechanism of action, there 
are more clinically relevant endpoints also directly related to the pharmacodynamic effects of azacitidine. 
Facing the possibility of the use of other endpoints (besides DNA methylation) as biomarkers for efficacy and 
pharmacodynamic  effect,  like  blasts  count/percentage  the  applicant  has  correlated  MRD  results  as  an 
exploratory measure of disease burden (related to residual bone marrow leukemic cells post therapy) which 
served  as  a  deeper  and  more  compelling  PD  readout  of  CC-486  efficacy.  The  correlation  performed  by  the 
applicant is valid and served as a PD endpoint in the summarized study. 
Although in the context of the current application, azacitidine is intended to be administered as monotherapy, 
there will be situations in which azacitidine might be clinically useful in concomitant administrations with other 
antineoplastic agents. As such, the applicant was asked to include a text in section 4.5 of the SmPC addressing 
the main possible clinical issues in case of a coadministration setting with other antineoplastic agents (in case 
of concomitant administration with other antineoplastic agents, caution and monitoring is recommended as an 
antagonistic,  additive,  or  synergistic  pharmacodynamic  effect  cannot  be  excluded.  These  effects  may  be 
dependent on the dose, sequence and schedule of administration).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Azacitidine has an extensive history as an antineoplastic agent and research tool over the past 4 decades.  The 
pharmacology data presented in this application were derived from numerous research publications rather than 
from GLP-compliant studies designed specifically to support an application for marketing authorisation.  
Azacitidine  is  believed  to  exert  its  antineoplastic  effects  through  multiple  mechanisms.  Azacitidine  is 
incorporated  into  DNA  and  RNA  following  cellular  uptake  and  enzymatic  biotransformation  to  nucleotide 
triphosphates.  
All  the  issues  initially  raised  related  to  pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacokinetics  of  oral  azacitidine  were  in 
general adequately clarified.  
The relevant information has been included in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
A dedicated dose response study with the to-be-marketed oral formulation of azacitidine tablets has not been 
submitted. 
The dose and schedule of oral azacitidine administered as 300 mg QD for the first 14 days of every 28-day 
treatment cycle selected for evaluation in the pivotal study Study CC-486-AML-001 were based on cumulative 
safety, efficacy, tolerability, and biologic data observed in Phase 1 Study (AZA PH US 2007 CL 005). 
Study  AZA  PH  US  2007  CL  005  was  designed  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  of  oral  azacitidine 
administered  according  to  different  treatment  schedules  and  to  evaluate  the  PK  behaviour  of  azacitidine 
administered by both oral and SC routes. 
The study AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 was conducted in 2 parts: 
• 
Part 1 was designed to compare the PK and PD of SC azacitidine administered for 7 days of a 28-day 
cycle in Cycle 1 (75 mg/m²/day) to that of oral azacitidine administered for 7 days of a 28-day cycle starting 
in Cycle 2 Day 1. For Cycle 2 and beyond, each subject received oral azacitidine QD for the first 7 days of each 
28-day cycle. The starting dose of oral azacitidine in Cycle 2 was 120 mg/day. 
• 
Part 2 was designed to evaluate oral azacitidinde during extended treatment periods (14 and 21 days) 
with both QD and BID treatment schedules in each 28-day cycle. Part 2 began once the MTD in Part 1 was 
determined and the MTD expansion cohort for that schedule had fully enrolled. During Cycles 1 and beyond of 
Part 2, subjects received oral azacitidine QD or BID for the first 14 or 21 days of each 28-day cycle. The 14-
day QD treatment regimen was evaluated first with a starting dose of 300 mg. 
Part 1 and Part 2 were each followed by an open-label extension phase to allow subjects to continue to receive 
oral azacitidine. 
With dose increases from 120 to 600 mg, exposure increased in a dose related manner. In Part 1 of the study, 
the mean terminal half-life was approximately 1.7 hours for SC azacitidine and ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 hour for 
oral azacitidine. The mean relative azacitidine oral bioavailability ranged from 6.9% to 22% across dose levels 
compared with SC treatment. In Part 2, similar PK results to Part 1 were observed. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
obtained following single 200-mg and 300-mg administrations (Day 1) and multiple 200-mg BID and 300-mg 
QD administrations (Day 14 and Day 21) were overall similar, indicating no accumulation. 
Following SC and oral administration, azacitidine was rapidly absorbed, with a median Tmax ranging from 0.5 
to 1.5 hours postdose. Mean terminal half-life was approximately 1.7 hours for SC azacitidine and ranged from 
0.4 to 1.0 hour for oral azacitidine. 
The  proposed  300  mg  QD  for  14  days  regimen  was  determined  to  be  biologically  active  (maintaining 
hypomethylation until the end of the 28-day treatment cycle [Garcia-Manero, 2016]) and was associated with 
an  overall  response  rate  (CR,  CRi,  PR,  or  any  transfusion  independence)  in  approximately  32%  of  subjects 
treated. This regimen was also generally well-tolerated, and therefore, could allow subjects to remain on study 
for protracted periods of time.

2.5.2.  Main study 
Study CC-486-AML-001:  
Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to compare the efficacy and 
safety of CC-486 plus BSC to placebo plus BSC as maintenance therapy in subjects who achieved CR/CRi after 
induction with intensive chemotherapy with or without consolidation.  
Methods 
Study Participants 
The  study  population  represented  AML  subjects  with  limited  treatment  options,  as  all  subjects  were  not 
considered candidates for allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplant by the Investigator (including those 
who were not eligible, did not have a transplant donor available, or chose not to proceed to HSCT). All subjects 
were required to receive intensive chemotherapy to achieve CR/CRi before entry into the study; however, specific 
regimens of induction and consolidation chemotherapy were not mandated in the protocol. 
To  avoid  enriching  the  study  population  with  patients  with  better  prognoses,  subjects  were  required  to  be 
randomized  within  4  months  (±  7  days)  of  achieving  CR/CRi,  as  longer  durations  of  remissions  have  been 
associated with better outcomes in patients with AML (Breems, 2005). Further, this window of up to 4 months 
allowed  time  for  eligible  patients  to  receive  up  to  4  cycles  of  consolidation  chemotherapy.  Subjects  were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive CC-486 at a starting dose of 300 mg QD for 14 days of a 28-day cycle or 
placebo. The study was conducted with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), according to the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline. 
Main inclusion criteria 
- Male or female subjects ≥ 55 years of age at the time of signing the ICF; 
- Newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed de novo AML or AML secondary to prior myelodysplastic disease or 
CMML; 
- Received induction therapy with intensive chemotherapy with or without consolidation therapy; 
- Achieved first CR/CRi status within 4 months (± 7 days) prior to randomization 
Main exclusion criteria 
- Had suspected or proven acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB M3) based on morphology, immunophenotype, 
molecular assay, or karyotype; or AML with previous hematologic disorder such as chronic myeloid leukemia 
or myeloproliferative neoplasms, excluding MDS and CMML; 
- Had AML associated with inv(16), t(8;21), t(16;16), t(15;17), or t(9;22) karyotypes or molecular evidence 
of such translocations; 
- Had prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation; 
- Achieved CR/CRi following therapy with hypomethylating agents; 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 56/101 
 
 
 
- Received therapy with hypomethylating agents for MDS and subsequently developed AML within 4 months of 
discontinuing the therapy with HMAs; 
- Had proven central nervous system leukemia; 
- Was a candidate for allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplant at screening; 
Treatments 
Following screening, eligible subjects were randomized to receive 300 mg Onureg or matching placebo QD for 
the first 14 days of each 28-day treatment cycle. One cycle of study treatment was dispensed to each subject 
on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.  
The first dose was to be administered within 3 days after randomization and within 4 months (± 7 days) of 
achieving CR/CRi. 
Subjects with AML relapse (≥ 5% and ≤ 15% blasts in the bone marrow) had the option to continue treatment 
with an extended dose schedule to 300 mg QD for 21 days, provided it was in the best interest of the subject 
to do so as judged by the Investigator. Similarly, if subjects experienced toxicity considered possibly related 
to treatment, dosing with investigational product could be interrupted or delayed, reduced to 200 mg daily for 
14 days or 200 mg daily for 7 days in a stepwise fashion. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to: 
•  Determine whether maintenance therapy with Onureg improved Overall Survival (OS) compared with 
placebo in the study population 
The secondary objective: 
• 
Included effect of Onureg on RFS (Relapse-free Survival), safety and tolerability, HRQoL and healthcare 
resource utilization 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization until death from any 
cause.  
The key secondary endpoint was Relapsed Free Survival (RFS), defined as the time from randomization to the 
date of first documented relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Other secondary endpoints were: Time to relapse from CR/Cri; Time to discontinuation from treatment and 
Safety/tolerability. 
Sample size 
For the determination of the sample size, the equality of OS curves was compared between the oral azacitidine 
and placebo treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test. Assuming a median OS of 16 months in the placebo

treated  group  (Baer,  2010;  Baer,  2011),  a  median  OS  of  22.9  months  in  the  oral  azacitidine  treated  group 
(43% improvement), and a study duration of 60 months with a drop-out rate of 5% from both treatment arms, 
over  the  duration  of  the  study,  this  design  required  330  deaths  and  approximately  460  subjects  (230  per 
treatment arm) to be randomized in order to achieve at least 90% power to detect a constant hazard ratio of 
0.70  and  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  OS.  It  is  assumed  that  the  OS  distribution  is 
exponential with a constant failure (hazard) rate and that accrual is non-uniform during an accrual period of 
36 months with 25% of the subjects accrued during each of the first 2 years of enrolment (50% accrued at 24 
months) and the remaining 50% accrued during the last year of enrolment. Sample size calculations are based 
on a one-sided alpha of 0.025 with one interim analysis for futility after 30% of the events have occurred.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 300 mg Onureg QD or placebo. Treatment was assigned 
by a central randomization procedure using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study.

Numbers analysed 
All primary and secondary clinical efficacy evaluations were conducted using the ITT population, which included 
all 472 randomized subjects. The mITT population, which was used for supportive analysis of the primary and 
key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  included  440  (93.2%)  subjects  who  received  a  minimum  of  1  cycle  of 
treatment, had CR/CRi at baseline, as programmatically determined by central laboratory data, and satisfied 
all eligibility criteria.

The difference of 32 patients between ITT and mITT groups is not expected to have a major influence on the 
outcome of the study.

The analysis for OS was repeated using de modified ITT population (included all subjects who met eligibility 
criteria, experienced no protocol violations during the study, and received a minimum of 1 cycle of treatment).  
The  results  were  consistent  with  those  of  the  primary  analysis  with  a  significantly  improved  OS  for  CC-486 
versus placebo (stratified log-rank test nominal p-value = 0.0004).  The median OS in the mITT population 
was 24.8 months for the CC-486 group and 14.6 months for the placebo group, with a clinically meaningful 
difference  in  median  OS  of  10.2  months  with  CC-486  treatment.    The  HR  was  0.66  (95%  CI:  0.53,  0.83), 
indicating a 34% reduction in the risk of death for the CC 486 group. 
Additional pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of censoring on the primary 
analysis due to subjects who withdrew consent from survival follow-up, and the potentially confounding effects 
of other cancer therapies received subsequent to the study therapy on OS.  These additional sensitivity analyses 
were based on the ITT population and analyzed using the same methods described previously for the primary 
efficacy endpoint.   
The analyses for subsequent therapies included: 
-   Censoring  for  the  use  of  any  subsequent  therapy  (including  post-treatment transplant)  for  AML.  For  this 
analysis,  subjects  who  received  any  subsequent  therapy  for  AML  following  discontinuation  from  study 
treatment were censored on the earlier date of the first subsequent therapy, or transplant date, regardless 
of survival status at the time of the final analysis.  
-   Censoring  for  the  use  of  disease-modifying  subsequent  AML  therapy,  defined  as  any  subsequent  AML 
therapy that is not hydroxycarbamide.

- Censoring for post-treatment transplant at the time of the transplant.  
In all cases, the results were generally consistent with the primary analysis with hazard ratios favoring CC-486 
over placebo (data not shown), demonstrating the robustness of the treatment effect. 
Secondary Endpoint: Relapse-Free Survival 
The  key  secondary  objectives  included  the  effect  of CC-486  on  RFS,  assessed  as  the  time  from  the  date  of 
randomization to the date of documented relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.

Controlled Trials 
CC-486-AML-001 
Supportive studies 
Support for the activity of azacitidine in active AML is provided by Phase 3 Study AZA-AML- 001, which used 
the SC formulation of azacitidine, and three Phase 1 studies with oral formulations of azacitidine ((AZA-MDS-
004, AZA PH US 2008 CL 008, and AZA PH US 2007 CL 005).  
Study AZA-AML- 001 
Study AZA-AML-001 is a completed international, multicenter, controlled, Phase 3 study with an open-label, 
randomized, parallel-group design.  
The study was set up with 3 phases: a Pre-randomization Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. 
Following screening for eligibility, enrolled subjects were assigned by the Investigator to 1 of 3 CCRs, based on 
local practice and an evaluation of the subject’s underlying disease condition, as follows: 
• 
• 
Intensive chemotherapy using IV cytarabine in conjunction with an anthracycline in a 7 + 3 regimen, 
plus BSC; 
Low-dose cytarabine 20 mg SC BID for 10 days, every 28 days, plus BSC; 
•  Best supportive care only.

The study  enrolled and treated 488 subjects. The experimental arm consisted of 241 subjects, the control arm 
of 247 subjects. The experimental arm received Azacitidine 75 mg/m2/day SC the control arm, CCR assigned 
by the investigator prior to randomization. Azacitidine was administered in a dose of 75 mg/m2/day SC for 7 
days of every 28 day cycle. 
Overall survival was the primary endpoint of the study and was evaluated from the time of randomization to 
death from any cause. RFS was the key secondary endpoint. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints included 
time to relapse and time to discontinuation from treatment, which supplement the primary and key secondary 
efficacy endpoints by providing additional temporal perspectives.  
Study results: 
Primary efficacy endpoint – overall survival 
The median OS was 10.4 months in the azacitidine group compared with 6.5 months in the combined CCR 
group, a clinically meaningful increase in median survival of 3.8 months with a corresponding 15% reduced 
risk of death (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.69, 1.03; stratified log rank p = 0.1009) 
Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Death from Any Cause (Intent-to-treat  Population) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The results for secondary endpoints were consistent with the improvement seen in the primary endpoint of 
OS.   
A clinically meaningful difference of 12.3% in one-year survival estimate was observed in favor of azacitidine 
(46.5% in the azacitidine group versus 34.3% in the CCR group). Consistent results were observed for one-
year survival in post hoc analyses. A clinically meaningful increase in the one-year survival estimate of 12.2% 
and  14.9%  were  observed  in  the  post  hoc  mITT  and  regression  based  imputation  analyses  in  favor  of 
azacitidine, respectively.

A trend toward improved median EFS was observed with azacitidine compared with the CCR treatment group 
(6.7  months  in  the  azacitidine  group  versus  4.8  months  in  the  CCR  group)  and  similar  median  RFS  were 
observed (9.3 months in the azacitidine group versus 10.5 months in the CCR group). 
Similar overall response rate (CR + CRi) as determined by the IRC were observed between azacitidine and 
CCR  treatment  groups  (27.8%  in  the  azacitidine  group  [19.5%  CR]  compared  to  25.1% in  the  CCR  group 
[21.9%  CR]).  The  median  duration  of  remission  was  10.4  months  for  the  azacitidine  subjects  versus  12.3 
months for the CCR subjects.  
Study AZA-MDS- 003 
This  was  a  Phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  design, 
with the aim of comparing the efficacy and safety of oral azacitidine to placebo in subjects with RBC transfusion-
dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤ 75 × 109/L) due to lower-risk MDS.  
The study enrolled 216 subjects at 101 sites globally.  
The  enrolled  study  subjects  represent  a  subset  of  the  IPSS  lower-risk  MDS  population  with  both  RBC 
transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia, and therefore has a far poorer prognosis than would be 
expected for the general group of patients with lower risk disease. The study consisted of 4 phases:  Screening, 
Double-blind treatment, Follow-up, and Extension. 
This study is still on-going; the Applicant submitted an interim report. 
Study results: 
Primary efficacy endpoint – RBC-TI 
The primary efficacy endpoint is RBC-TI with duration ≥ 56 days (8 weeks). As of the cut-off date, a greater 
proportion of subjects in the oral azacitidine treatment group achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (30.8% 
of subjects) than in the placebo treatment group (11.9% of subjects). 
The  difference in  the proportion of  subjects  with  RBC-TI  with  duration  ≥  56  days  between the  2 treatment 
groups was 18.9%. Statistically significant (p < 0.0005) results  favoured the CC-486 treatment group over 
placebo treatment group. 
The analysis for the primary endpoint in the mITT population was consistent with that of the ITT population.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
AML is a rare, heterogeneous, and aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by rapid progression of 
the disease and symptoms and is uniformly fatal if not treated.  
Azacitidine  is  an  analogue  of  the  naturally  occurring  pyrimidine  nucleoside  cytidine  and  is  classified  as  an 
antimetabolite.  Vidaza,  the  injectable  formulation  of  the  same  active  ingredient  azacitidine,  is  considered  a 
standard of care for patients with AML who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy globally.  
The oral form of azacitidine was developed to allow sustained and extended administration of azacitidine at 
lower systemic doses than can be practically achieved with parenteral therapy.  
The proposed starting dose is 300 mg orally, once daily (QD) for the first 14 days of each 28-day cycle. In the 
case  of  disease  relapse  during  therapy  with  5%  to  15%  blasts  in  peripheral  blood  or  bone  marrow,  in 
conjunction with clinical assessment, the dosing schedule may be extended from 14 days to 21 days of repeated 
28-day cycles. 
A dedicated dose response study with the to-be-marketed oral formulation of azacitidine tablets has not been 
submitted. According to the Applicant, the cumulative data support the 300 mg QD dose for 14 out of 28 days 
as the appropriate oral azacitidine dose for maintenance therapy for patients with AML who have achieved CR 
or CRi after intensive induction therapy with or without consolidation. The approach of the Applicant can be 
considered acceptable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is mainly supported by the following study: 
- 
a pivotal phase 3 study CC-486-AML-001 and  
Phase 1 studies (AZA-MDS-004, AZA PH US 2008 CL 008, and AZA PH US 2007 CL 005) can only be considered 
as supportive and exploratory of the proposed dose regimen.  
Study  CC-486-AML-001  was  a  Phase  3,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study 
designed to compare the efficacy and safety of CC-486 plus BSC to placebo plus BSC as maintenance therapy 
in subjects who achieved CR/CRi after induction with intensive chemotherapy with or without consolidation. 
Population 
The study enrolled subjects who were in first CR/CRi following intensive induction chemotherapy with or without 
consolidation  chemotherapy.  Subjects  with  CR/CRi  after  treatment  with  hypomethylating  agents  (HMAs), 
subjects with good risk cytogenetics, and those who were candidates for HSCT were excluded. 
One  of  two  amendments  introduced  to  the  protocol  CC-486-AML-001  concerned  the  modification  of  the 
Inclusion Criterion #4 to change the amount of time required for subjects to be in complete remission (CR) or 
in complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) from 3 months to 4 months (± 7 days). This 
amendment  had  the  potential  to  increase  the  number  of  patients  included  in  the  trial  with  best  prognostic 
factors, that were able to maintain the response for a long period of time. However, in the applicant’s opinion 
this effect would not influence the final results of the study, because the randomization would be a guarantee 
that the proportion of patients with better prognosis would be balanced between both arms. In fact, according 
to  the  applicant’s  response,  the  number  of  subjects  that  received  1  or  2  cycles  of  consolidation  was  equal 
distributed between the treatment arms and the median time from first achieving CR to randomization was 85 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 79/101 
 
 
 
days  for  all  patients,  and  84.5  days  for  the  oral  azacitidine  group  and  86  days  for  the  placebo  group.  The 
explanation provided in the applicant’s response is considered acceptable.  
Study CC-486-AML-001 randomized 472 subjects (238 to CC-486 and 234 to placebo) at 147 investigational 
sites. The subject population comprised adult subjects (median age of 68.0 years, range 55 to 86 years) of 
both  genders  (51.9%  male)  who  were  predominantly  white  (87.5%).  Subjects  had  been  diagnosed  with  de 
novo  (90.9%)  or  secondary  (9.1%)  AML  with  intermediate  (86.0%)  or  poor  (14.0%)  cytogenetic  risk  at 
diagnosis. Subjects were in CR (81.4%) or CRi (18.6%) after induction therapy with or without consolidation 
therapy. The median time from first achieving CR/CRi to randomization was 85.0 days. The majority of subjects 
(80.1%)  had  received  consolidation  therapy.  At  randomization,  51.7%  of  subjects  were  minimal  residual 
disease (MRD) negative and 46.4% were MRD positive.  
The study population can be considered appropriate and selected avoid enrichment. Study participants can be 
considered representative for the therapeutic indication of azacitidine.  
Duration 
The median treatment duration was 11.6 months for the oral azacitidine group and 5.7 months for the placebo 
group;  the  median  number  of  cycles  received  was  12.0  and  6.0,  respectively.  Such  duration  is  considered 
acceptable for an already approved substance. 
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was OS, defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. The key 
secondary endpoint was RFS, defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented relapse 
or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Crossover between the treatment groups was not allowed 
so as to minimize the confounding impacts on the assessment of OS. The primary efficacy variable, defined as 
time from randomization to death from any cause, and the primary efficacy analysis for OS were performed 
using the ITT population.  
The endpoints are considered appropriate for the proposed therapeutic indications of the oral form of an already 
approved active substance.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Study  CC-486-AML-001  results  demonstrated  significantly  longer  OS  and  RFS  with  oral  azacitidine  versus 
placebo (stratified log-rank test p = 0.0009 for OS and p = 0.0001 for RFS). The median OS was 24.7 months 
for  the  oral  azacitidine  group  and  14.8 months  for  the  placebo  group  after  a  median  follow-up  time  of 
41.2 months based on reverse Kaplan-Meier method, with a clinically meaningful difference in median OS of 
9.9 months with CC-486 treatment. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.86), 
indicating a 31% reduction in the risk of death for the oral azacitidine group. The median RFS was 10.2 months 
for the oral azacitidine group and 4.8 months for the placebo group, with a clinically meaningful difference in 
median RFS of 5.4 months with oral azacitidine treatment. The HR was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81), indicating 
a 35% reduction in risk of relapse or death for the oral azacitidine group. A lower death rate was observed in 
the oral azacitidine group compared with the placebo group as early as 90 days after randomization (4 [1.7%] 
subjects versus 20 [8.5%] subjects, respectively).  
The improvement in OS was seen in different subgroups of patients and was particularly strong among patients 
older than 65 years (HR = 0,71 (0,56 a 0,92)) and patients older than 75 years (HR = 0,48 (0,25 a 0,94)), 
Assessment report

Page 80/101 
 
 
 
which is clinically relevant, because at these ages the patients are not eligible to bone marrow transplant and 
the risk of relapse is very high.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  surviving  at  the  1-year  time  point  was  72.8%  in  the  oral  azacitidine  group  and 
55.8% in the placebo group, for a difference of 17.0%. The proportion of subjects surviving at the 2-year time 
point was 50.6% in the oral azacitidine group and 37.1% in the placebo group, for a difference of 13.5%.    
The probability of RFS at the 6-month time point was 67.4% in the oral azacitidine group and 45.2% in the 
placebo  group,  for  a  difference  of  22.2%.  The  probabilities  of  RFS  were  consistently  higher  for  the  oral 
azacitidine group than for the placebo group at each of the later time points (44.9% versus 27.4%, respectively, 
at 1 year and 26.6% versus 17.4% at 2 years), demonstrating durable efficacy over time for oral azacitidine 
treatment.  Sensitivity  analyses  of  OS  and  RFS  provided  support  for  the  robustness  and  consistency  of  the 
results of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.  
A  9.9-month  improvement  in  median  OS  in  the oral  azacitidine  treatment  was  reached,  compared  with  the 
placebo, however after 48 months the survival probability was very close to each other in both arms and the 
Kaplan-Meier curves were almost overlapping from 64 months onwards. The provided updated OS data from 
15 Oct 2019 and 20 Sep 2020 (providing 3 and ~14 additional months of follow-up, respectively) and RFS data 
from 15 Oct 2019 (3 additional months of follow-up) are consistent with the results from the earlier data cut 
(15 Jul 2019) reported in the clinical study report (CSR), with unchanged median OS and RFS  and HR  with 
additional follow-up, demonstrating the robustness of the results. Furthermore, the tail end of the updated OS 
and RFS curves showed increased separation compared with those from the earlier data cut provided in the 
CSR.  It  is  agreed  that  the  updated  data  support  the  original  conclusion  that  oral  azacitidine  maintenance 
therapy  has  significant  impact  on  survival  and  delay  of  relapse  in  subjects  who  achieved  CR/CRi  following 
intensive chemotherapy. 
Other secondary endpoints (time to relapse and time to discontinuation from treatment) also demonstrated 
the benefit of oral azacitidine as maintenance therapy for the treatment of AML. The median time to relapse 
was  10.2 months  in  the  oral  azacitidine  group  and  4.9 months  in  the  placebo  group.  The  median  time  to 
treatment discontinuation for any reason was 11.4 months in the oral azacitidine group and 6.1 months in the 
placebo group.  
Study  CC-486-AML-001  also  demonstrated  that  subjects  receiving  oral  azacitidine,  compared  with  those 
receiving placebo, had significantly lower rates of hospitalization events (0.48 events per person-year for the 
oral azacitidine group and 0.64 events per person-year for the placebo group; nominal p = 0.0068) and number 
of days hospitalized (7.89 days per person-year for oral azacitidine compared with 13.36 day per person-year 
for placebo; nominal p < 0.0001). 
The results for the secondary endpoints corroborated the results seen with the primary endpoint. 
The results demonstrated that oral azacitidine, as maintenance therapy, significantly improved OS and RFS, 
while maintaining HRQoL comparable to placebo and the general population. Results from the hospitalization 
analyses indicate that treatment with oral azacitidine can potentially lead to a reduction in healthcare resource 
utilization associated with hospitalizations.  
It has been noted that a large percentage of patients in both groups discontinued treatment (81.9% and 88.9% 
for oral azacitidine and placebo respectively) mainly due to disease relapse. This is not considered uncommon.  
In  the  subgroup  analysis,  it  appears  that  only  in  European  population  the  effect  of  oral  azacitidine  was 
favourable. The Applicant performed additional analyses that showed that regional or racial differences in the 
OS and RFS benefit associated with oral azacitidine treatment were likely due to larger variability caused by 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 81/101 
 
 
 
small sample size. The overall study results can be applied to the global population and not only to the European 
population  and  a  similar  clinical  benefit  from  oral  azacitidine  treatment  is  expected  in  the  overall  study 
population. This is due to the following: 
1) There are no notable differences in treatment practices across North America and EU, and OS and RFS 
are similar for patients treated with oral azacitidine in both regions.  
2) The statistical assessment including post-hoc subgroup analyses, multivariate analyses all support that 
the overall results from the ITT analysis are applicable to both regions. 
The effect on the probabilities of RFS from the 36 months onward observation in the pivotal study.  
The applicant adequately discussed the reason of not including exploratory endpoints in the study protocol, i.e. 
measures  of  cytogenetics,  DNA  methylation,  single  nucleotide  polymorphism,  gene  sequencing,  gene 
expression,  micro-ribonucleic  acid  expression  and/or  cellular  protein  expression.  Certain  endpoints  i.e.  high 
resolution DNA methylation and next generation sequencing (NGS) were not available at the time of protocol 
development.  The  Applicant  has  completed  several  exploratory  analyses,  which  are  provided  in  separate 
reports:  CC-486  (QUAZAR)  AML-001:  Analyses  of  exploratory  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  data  and 
correlative studies with clinical endpoints and CC-486-AML-001: Analyses of Pharmacodynamic Changes of CC-
486 and Correlative Studies with CC-486 Drug Exposure and Clinical Endpoints. 
In  some  subgroups  of  disease-related  factors,  mainly  patients  in  CRi  or  patients  with  MRD-negative  after 
randomization, the evidence of observed benefit was not so strong with a HR = 0.74 (0,45 to 1.20) for CRi 
subgroup and HR = 0.81 (0,59 to 1.12) for the MRD-negative subgroup. 
Although it has been shown that in the population of subjects aged ≥ 65 years suffering from newly diagnosed 
AML with a BM blast count > 30% and not eligible for HSCT, treatment with azacitidine resulted in a median OS 
of 10.4 months, a clinically meaningful increase of 3.8 months over CCR with an increase of 12.3% in the 1-
year  survival  estimate  over  CCR,  the  primary  OS  analysis  did  not  meet  the  conventional  level  of  statistical 
significance. 
It would have been expected that the final results Study AZA-MDS-003 could provide confirmatory support of 
the efficacy and safety of oral azacitidine. However, the primary objective of the trial was not related to OS or 
RFS. The objective was to evaluate RBC Transfusion Independence (RBC-TI) in each of the 2 treatment groups 
(oral  azacitidine  [CC-486]  versus  placebo)  in  subjects  with  RBC  transfusion-dependent  anemia  and 
thrombocytopenia due to IPSS lower-risk MDS. However, subjects were treated for vitamin B12 deficiency. This 
makes the interpretation of the interim results difficult. The Applicant clarified that all 3 subjects in Study AZA-
MDS-003 were treated with vitamin B12 only following the diagnosis of deficiency. No other subjects received 
vitamin B12 during the study to correct potential B12 deficiency. 
In respect to the design of the pivotal study, the applicant was asked to clarify the rational for the possibility of 
the extension of treatment after relapse from 14 to 21 days of oral azacitidine in the experimental arm, as it 
would not be expected that a patient progressing on maintenance treatment would be able to respond with an 
increase of dose as no data was presented to suggest any effectiveness of this option. In addition, safety data 
analyses suggest that this schedule should be avoided as patients present a higher rate of serious TEAE and 
TEAE leading to death. According with the applicant there was evidence from the study AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 
that the extension of the treatment to 21 days was well tolerated and only minimal associated with an increase 
in  AEs.  The  applicant  also  considered  that  because  of  the  interpatient  variability  in  oral  azacitidine  drug 
absorption, extending the dosing schedule to 21 days would provide more drug exposure of leukemic cells and 
increase the probability of response. However, according to the results of overall response rate provided by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 82/101 
 
 
 
applicant, 23,3% of the subjects in the oral azacitidine group and in 11,4% in the control group achieved CR/CRi. 
Considering the number of patients included in the extension program and the difference in overall response 
that was obtained, it is difficult to demonstrate that extending the treatment period after relapse increases the 
overall response rate in comparison with placebo. However, in the absence of new safety signals, in cases of 
disease  relapse,  with  5%  to  15%  blasts  in  peripheral  blood  or  bone  marrow,  in  conjunction  with  a  clinical 
assessment,  an  extension  of  the  dosing  schedule  from  14  to  21 days  of  repeated  28-day  cycles  should  be 
considered. Dosing should not exceed 21 days during any 28-day period. Onureg should be discontinued if more 
than 15% blasts are observed in either the peripheral blood or bone marrow or at the physician’s discretion. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the pivotal study demonstrated a significant and clinically meaningful prolongation of survival 
with a corresponding delay of relapse in subjects who achieved CR/Cri following intensive chemotherapy.  
Given  the  limited  effectiveness  of  current  maintenance  treatments  for  patients  who  attain  remission  after 
intensive  induction  therapy  and  for  whom  HSCT  is  not  feasible,  maintenance  therapy  with  CC-486  may 
represent a treatment option for this underserved patient population. Furthermore, maintaining patients in CR 
for  as  long  as  possible  is  important  since  occurrence  of  relapse  is  universally associated  with  short  survival 
despite treatment with salvage therapy. 
In  some  subgroups  of  disease-related  factors,  mainly  patients  in  CRi  or  patients  with  MRD-negative  after 
randomization, the observed benefit should be taken with care because the evidence was not so strong with a 
HR = 0.74 (0,45 to 1.20) for CRi subgroup and HR = 0.81 (0,59 to 1.12) for the MRD-negative subgroup. 
Based upon these data, oral azacitidine may be considered as maintenance therapy for adult patients with AML 
who are not candidates for curative treatment with bone marrow transplant. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The main focus of the safety analysis is on safety in the target population from the pivotal Study CC-486-AML-
001. The overall evaluation of safety is derived from 11 clinical studies encompassing the clinical development 
program for CC-486 as monotherapy, including 9 haematology studies and 2 solid tumor studies. Eight studies 
have been completed and 3 studies are ongoing. 
The ISS Safety Population included 640 subjects who took at least one dose of CC-486 as monotherapy and 
for  whom  planned  treatment  schedule  was  at  least  7  days  study  drug  per  cycle.  The  233  placebo-treated 
subjects from Study CC-486-AML-001 are also included for comparison. In order to evaluate the overall safety 
profile of CC-486, analyses were performed for 6 safety pools with various studies included.  
- Pool 1 - AML Maintenance, includes both maintenance studies: AML-001 (post-chemotherapy maintenance) 
and AML-002 (post-transplant maintenance); 
-  Pool  2  -  Myeloid  Malignancies,  includes  all  subjects  with  active  myeloid  malignancy  diseases  (AML, 
myelodysplastic  syndromes  [MDS],  and  chronic  myelomonocytic  leukemia  [CMML])  from  studies  other  than 
AML-001 and AML-002. The rationale for separating Pools 2 and 3 is that the subjects with myeloid malignancies 
have  more  suppressed  bone  marrows  than  subjects  with  solid  tumors  or  lymphomas  and  therefore  may 
represent different levels of risk in terms of safety of CC-486; 
- Pool 3 - Solid Tumor and Lymphoma studies are included to provide additional safety data; 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 83/101 
 
 
 
- Pools 4 to 6 (Pooling CC-486 300 mg starting dose by schedule). The proposed starting dose for the targeted 
indication (300 mg QD), has been used in multiple CC-486 studies with three schedules: 7, 14, and 21 days of 
each 28-day treatment cycle. All subjects treated with the 3 different schedules are included in the following 
pools:  
- Pool 4: 300 mg 14 days per 28-day treatment cycle (the schedule used in the pivotal study AML-
001), 
- Pool 5: 300 mg 21 days per 28-day treatment cycle, and 
- Pool 6: 300 mg 7 days per 28-day treatment cycle. (Note that there are only 4 subjects in this pool) 
Patient exposure 
In the pivotal study, the median treatment duration was 11.6 months (range: 0.5 to 74.3 months) for the CC-
486 group and 5.7 months (range: 0.7 to 68.5 months) for the placebo group. The median average daily dose 
was 300.0 mg in each group (range: 202.8 to 300.6 mg, CC-486 and 150.0 to 353.6 mg, placebo). The median 
number of treatment cycles was 12.0 (range: 1.0 to 80.0) in the CC-486 group and 6.0 (range: 1.0 to 73.0) 
in the placebo group. 
In the pivotal study, the demographic characteristics of the safety population were well balanced between the 
CC-486 and placebo treatment groups. The median (range) ages were 68.0 (55, 86) and 68.0 (55, 82) years 
in the CC-486 and placebo group, respectively. Most subjects were between 65 and 75 years of age (60.6% 
CC-486, 60.9% placebo), white (91.1%, CC-486 and 84.5%, placebo) and of European descent (70.8% CC-
486, 62.7% placebo). Both treatment groups were well balanced between sexes (50% male and female, CC-
486; 54.5% male and 45.5% female, placebo). 
In  the  safety  population  of  the  pivotal  study,  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced 
between the CC-486 and placebo groups. 
Adverse events 
Analyses of TEAEs, including by severity, serious TEAEs and events leading to discontinuation, dose reductions 
and  interruptions  are  summarized  for  the  pivotal  study  and  for  Safety  Pools  4,  5  and  6.  For  Pool  2  (active 
myeloid malignancies regardless of dose and dosing schedule) and Pool 3 (solid tumor/lymphoma), only for 
analyses of all TEAEs by SOC and PT is provided. 
The primary analysis of TEAEs in the ISS excludes the following adverse event PTs from the pivotal study AML-
001: acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia recurrent, leukemia cutis, leukemia recurrent, central 
nervous system leukemia, and chloroma. 
The discussion of adverse events focused on the target population from the pivotal study CC-486-AML-001. 
Data from the 6 safety pools is summarized as supportive. 
Prophylaxis against infections or gastrointestinal events was permitted in the clinical studies; however, in the 
pivotal study and the AZA-MDS-003 study, it was not required per protocol because of the placebo-controlled 
nature of the study designs. 
For the pivotal study CC-486-AML-001, the SOCs in which TEAEs were most commonly reported (> 50% in the 
CC-486  group)  were  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (CC-486:  91.1%;  placebo:  61.8%),  Blood  and  Lymphatic 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 84/101 
 
 
 
System Disorders (65.7%, 47.2%), Infections and Infestations (62.3%; 52.8%), and General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (57.2%; 48.5%). 
After adjustment for exposure (EAIR), the incidence of TEAEs per 100 subject-years remained higher in the 
CC-486 treatment groups than in the placebo treatment group in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal Disorders (CC-
486: 539.20; placebo: 127.64), and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (91.81; 59.58). For the SOC of 
Infections  and  Infestations,  the  EAIR  was  lower  in  the  CC-486  group  than in the  placebo  group  (84.80  and 
94.40, respectively). 
Treatment emergent adverse events in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC for which the frequency differed by 
> 2% between treatment groups were nausea (CC-486: 64.8%; placebo: 23.6%), vomiting (59.7%; 9.9%), 
diarrhea (50.4%; 21.5%), constipation (38.6%; 24.0%). 
Other TEAEs for which the frequency differed by > 2% between treatment groups were, neutropenia (44.5%; 
26.2%),  thrombocytopenia  (33.5%;  27.0%),  fatigue  (29.7%;  19.3%),  anemia  (20.3%;  18.0%),  asthenia 
(18.6%; 5.6%). 
In general, the most frequently reported SOCs and TEAEs across all safety pools, were the same types as those 
in  the  pivotal  study  with  slight  differences  between  pools.  Overall,  in  Pool  5,  the  21/28-day  dosing  pool  in 
subjects with active myeloid disease, the incidences of TEAEs was higher compared to the pivotal study. 
Overall, most TEAEs reported with CC-486 treatment in the pivotal study and across safety pools, were Grade 
1 or 2 and these were most frequently reported in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC. 
In the pivotal study, at least 1 Grade 3 of 4 TEAE was reported for 71.6% of subjects in the CC-486 group and 
63.1% of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 10% of subjects in the CC-
486  group)  were  in  the  following  SOCs:  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (55.5%  CC-486;  41.2% 
placebo); Infections and Infestations (20.3% CC-486; 11.6% placebo); and Gastrointestinal Disorders (14.4% 
CC-486; 5.6% placebo). 
The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  or  4  TEAE  preferred  terms  (>  10%  in  the  CC-486  group)  were 
neutropenia  (41.1%;  23.6%),  thrombocytopenia  (22.5%;  21.5%),  anemia  (14.0%;  12.9%),  and  febrile 
neutropenia (11.4%; 7.7%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The focus of the discussion of AESIs is on the categories for which an imbalance between CC486 treatment and 
placebo  was  observed  in  the  pivotal  Study  CC-486-AML-001.  These  imbalances  were  observed  for 
myelosuppression, infection, and gastrointestinal AESIs. 
Myelosuppression  AESIs  included  the  subcategories  of  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anemia  and  general 
myelosuppression.  In  the  pivotal  study,  the  most  frequently  reported  (>  10%  in  the  CC-486  group)  AESI 
preferred  terms  (CC-486;  placebo)  were  neutropenia  (44.5%;  26.2%),  thrombocytopenia  (33.5%;  27.0%), 
anemia (20.3%; 18.0%), febrile neutropenia (11.9%; 7.7%), and leukopenia (10.6%; 8.2%). In general, these 
events  occurred  at  consistent  frequencies  over  time  in  both  treatment  groups  with  the  highest  frequencies 
observed in Cycle 13 and beyond. 
While myelosuppression AESIs occurred more frequently with CC-486 treatment compared to placebo, these 
events were largely manageable with dose modifications and standard therapeutic intervention, and few events 
resulted in discontinuation of study therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 85/101 
 
 
 
Because  myelosuppression,  specifically  neutropenia,  is  a  known  risk  of  azacitidine  treatment  and  of  AML 
relapse, there is an increased risk of infections in this subject population. 
In  the  pivotal  study,  infection  AESIs  of  any  grade  occurred  in  62.3%  of  subjects  in  the  CC-486  group  and 
52.8% in the placebo group. When adjusted for time of exposure, incidence rates for these events were 84.80 
per 100 person-years for the CC-486 group and 94.40 per 100 person-years for the placebo group. In general, 
these events occurred at increasing frequencies over time in both treatment groups with the highest frequencies 
observed in Cycles 13 and beyond. The 3 infection AESIs leading to death in the CC-486 group were Klebsiella 
sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, and sepsis. 
While infection AESIs occurred in a larger percentage of subjects on CC-486 compared to placebo, exposure 
adjusted incidence rates were higher in placebo-treated subjects. For the most part, these infections were likely 
mainly  due  to  community  acquired  viral  type  infections.  These  events  were  largely  manageable  with  dose 
modifications, and few events resulted in death or discontinuation of study therapy. 
Dose modifications for gastrointestinal toxicities, with specific guidance including treatment for Grade 3 or 4 
diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting,  were  included in  the  protocol  of  the  pivotal  study.  The  use  of  a  serotonin 
receptor antagonist, such as ondansetron or other comparable medication, as an antiemetic prophylaxis was 
permitted;  however,  it  was  not  required  in  the  protocol  because  of  placebo  control  by  study  design.  While 
increased age is a factor for constipation, it may also result either from pre-treatment/post-treatment with an 
antiemetic or from antidiarrheal medication as part of patient management while on study. 
In the pivotal study, gastrointestinal AESI of any grade occurred in 91.1% of subjects in the CC-486 group and 
66.5% of subjects in the placebo group. When adjusted for time of exposure, incidence rates for these events 
were  570.50  per  100  person-years  for  the  CC-486  group  and  151.12  per  100  person-years  for  the  placebo 
group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  (>  5%  in  the  CC-486  group)  gastrointestinal  AESI  preferred  terms  (CC-486; 
placebo)  were  nausea  (64.8%;  23.6%),  vomiting  (59.7%;  9.9%),  diarrhoea  (50.4%;  21.5%),  constipation 
(38.6%;  24.0%),  abdominal  pain  (13.1%;  6.9%),  abdominal  pain  upper  (8.9%;  5.2%),  flatulence  (5.5%; 
1.7%), and oropharyngeal pain (5.5%; 8.2%). In general, in the CC-486 group these events occurred at the 
highest frequencies in Cycles 1 to 2 and decreased through Cycles 7 to 12 with increased frequencies seen in 
Cycles 13 or greater. 
The applicant states that gastrointestinal events were largely manageable with dose modifications, few resulted 
in discontinuation of therapy, and none were fatal. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations are presented for AML Maintenance (Pool 1: pivotal study and Study AML-002), 
and Pools 4 – 6. Routine laboratory monitoring included the assessment of hematology and serum chemistry. 
Abnormalities noted in the laboratory test results were consistent with the previously established safety profile 
of azacitidine and with the underlying disease and medical history of the subjects in the various safety pools. 
Markedly abnormal laboratory test results were infrequent and transient. 
In  the  CC-486  group  of  the  pivotal  study,  clinically  significant  abnormalities  in  hematology  parameters, 
recorded  as  Grade  3  or  higher  laboratory  values,  generally  occurred  beyond  Cycle  18,  whereas  Grade  3  or 
higher hematology values in the placebo group occurred more frequently in Cycles 7 through 12. Over time, 
hematology results may reflect AML relapse in addition to treatment effects.

There were no notable findings in chemistry laboratory parameters with CC-486 treatment. Overall, there were 
few  shifts  from  baseline  and  individual  clinically  significant  abnormalities  were  consistent  with  the  diseases 
under study. 
For  the  pivotal  study  CC486-AML-001,  changes  from  baseline  in  vital  signs  (systolic  and  diastolic  blood 
pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and weight) were summarized by timepoint. There were no notable 
changes in any vital sign parameter from baseline to treatment discontinuation.

N/A 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal clinical drug interaction studies with injectable or oral azacitidine have been conducted. Based on in-
vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs); 
therefore,  CYP  inhibitors  and  inducers  are  unlikely  to  have  any  impact  on  the  metabolism  of  azacitidine. 
Azacitidine is not a P-gp substrate or inhibitor and is unlikely to produce any clinically relevant interactions with 
P-gp. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the CC-486 and placebo groups of the pivotal study, 13.1% and 4.3% of subjects, respectively, experienced 
at least 1 TEAE leading to study treatment discontinuation. In the CC-486 group, TEAEs leading to treatment

discontinuation experienced by more than 1 subject were nausea (2.1% versus 0%), diarrhea (1.7% versus 
0%), vomiting (1.3% versus 0%), abdominal pain upper, and fatigue (0.8% versus 0% for each). 
Gastrointestinal disorders that led to treatment discontinuation occurred at a higher frequency overall (SOC: 
4.7% CC-486; 5.3% Pool 1; 4.8% Pool 4; and 6.7% Pool 5) and for each preferred term in the CC-486 group 
compared to the placebo group (SOC: 0.4%). 
In Study CC-486-AMl-001, a maximum of 1 dose reduction to a daily dose of 200 mg was permitted in the 
event of toxicity. In the event of continuing toxicity that did not respond to dose reduction, a maximum of 1 
treatment  schedule  (frequency)  modification  from  14  to  7  days  was  allowed.  Treatment-emergent  adverse 
events leading to dose reduction were reported for 15.7% of subjects in the CC-486 group and 2.6% of subjects 
in the placebo group. 
The types of TEAEs that led to dose reduction were consistent with the safety profile of azacitidine. 
In the pivotal study, treatment-emergent adverse events leading to dose interruption were reported for 43.2% 
and 17.2%, in the CC-486 and placebo group, respectively. In general, the types of TEAEs that led to dose 
interruption were consistent with the safety profile of azacitidine. 
Post marketing experience 
Oral azacitidine is currently marketed in the US.  
Post marketing experience is available for injectable azacitidine (Vidaza) and includes approximately 443,478 
patients up to 18 May 2019. 
Cumulatively, approximately 21,293 subjects have been treated with azacitidine in clinical studies.  
During  the  reporting  interval  (19  May  2018  to  18  May  2019),  potential  safety  signals  for  azacitidine  of 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), eosinophilic pneumonia (EP), and differentiation syndrome 
(DS)  were  identified  and  Safety  Topic  Reviews  (STRs)  were  performed.  Based  upon  these  analyses,  the 
available data did not provide enough evidence to support a causal relationship between PML, EP and DS, and 
azacitidine. The signals were closed and refuted. The signals evaluated and a review of all the risks during the 
reporting interval provided no new information requiring changes to labelling or risk mitigation.  
Although  the  STR  did  not  indicate  a  causal  relationship  between  azacitidine  and  Differentiation  Syndrome, 
following communication with the FDA, the MAA agreed to submit by 1Q 2020 a post-marketing section of the 
Vidaza USPI that would include Differentiation Syndrome. 
Other safety information 
There were 4 cases of overdose reported for subjects receiving oral azacitidine. There were no adverse events 
associated with the overdoses except for 1 case in which the subject reported nausea on the day of the overdose 
which resolved the same day.  
No potential for drug dependence, misuse, or abuse have been noted for oral azacitidine in any of the clinical 
studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021

There is no pharmacological mechanism by which withdrawal of oral azacitidine would be expected to exert any 
adverse  pharmacodynamic  effect.  There  is  no  evidence  of  withdrawal  effects  during  interruptions  of  oral 
azacitidine treatment and following cessation of oral azacitidine treatment. 
No studies on the effects of oral azacitidine on the ability to drive or use machinery have been performed. 
Pregnant  and  lactating  women  were  excluded  from  the  study  population  and  throughout  the  clinical 
development program. As of the safety data cut-off date, there are no data regarding the clinical effects of 
injectable or oral azacitidine in pregnancy. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the pivotal study CC-486-AML-001, oral azacitidine showed a manageable and acceptable safety profile that 
is consistent with the known safety profile of azacitidine (observed with the injectable formulation).  
The  safety  profile  of  oral  azacitidine  is  primarily  characterized  by  the  gastrointestinal  toxicities  of  nausea, 
vomiting,  diarrhea,  constipation  and  abdominal  pain,  and  hematologic  toxicities  of  neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia and leukopenia.  
Most  gastrointestinal  events  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  and  were  largely  manageable  with  dose 
modifications,  few  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  therapy,  and  none  were  fatal.  While  neutropenia  occurred 
more frequently with oral azacitidine treatment compared to placebo, these events were largely manageable 
with dose modifications and standard therapeutic intervention, few events resulted in discontinuation of study 
therapy and none were fatal in the pivotal study. Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. 
Patients with low platelet counts should be advised to report early signs or symptoms of bleeding.  
Overall, adverse events of infections occurred in > 60% of oral azacitidine-treated subjects in the pivotal study 
and  across  the  safety  pools  and  in  >  50%  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  were  largely  attributed  to 
viral/community  type  infections  (e.g.,  influenza,  nasopharyngitis  and  pneumonia).  However,  individual  PTs 
occurred  in  <  20%  of  subjects  and  while  individual  infection  PTs  occurred  in  a  larger  proportion  of  oral 
azacitidine -treated subjects compared to placebo, exposure adjusted incidence rates in Study CC-486-AML-
001 were higher in placebo-treated subjects.  
Anti-emetic and anti-diarrheal medications, GCSF and anti-infective medications should be considered (based 
on individual patient characteristics, treatment response and according to the current clinical guidelines) during 
oral azacitidine treatment as prophylaxis for treatment of gastrointestinal events, neutropenia and infections, 
respectively). 
A PK analysis performed by the applicant seems to suggest that the occurrence of gastrointestinal AEs (i.e. 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) do not significantly affect absorption over the first two cycles thereby decreasing 
the risk of reduced efficacy. Moreover, the risk of gastrointestinal AEs appears to be transient with reduced 
incidence after Cycle 1.  
There were no adverse events associated with the overdoses reported in the clinical trials except for 1 case in 
which the subject reported nausea on the day of the overdose which resolved the same day. In the event of 
overdose, the patient should be monitored including appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive 
treatment, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for azacitidine overdose. See Section 4.9 of the 
SmPC.

There are no adequate data from the use of Onureg in pregnant women. Studies in mice and rats have shown 
reproductive and developmental toxicity (see Non-Clinical section). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, women of childbearing potential receiving 
azacitidine should be advised to avoid pregnancy and use effective contraception during treatment and up to 
6 months after treatment. Male patients receiving azacitidine should be advised to use effective contraception 
up to 3 months after the last dose of oral azacitidine.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Given the extensive experience from injectable azacitidine, the safety profile of the oral product seems fairly 
well established and the main adverse effects are gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities.  
The incidence of gastrointestinal toxicities appears to be higher with the oral formulations as compared with 
the parenteral formulation.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the fact that Onureg involves a new route of administration and the indication, posology and dosing 
schedule differ from the azacitidine for injection, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD 
list for oral azacitidine is needed. The new entry for oral azacitidine should have a PSUR submission cycle of 1 
year.  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 19 May 2004. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Onureg is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who achieved 
complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction 
therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates for, including those who choose 
not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  usual  treatments  for  newly  diagnosed  AML  patients  without  serious  comorbidities  include  intensive 
chemotherapy  to  induce  remission  (induction  chemotherapy).  Intensive  induction  chemotherapy  typically 
consists of cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline. In order to deepen the level of remission through 
eradication of residual leukemia, patients typically receive consolidation chemotherapy. There is no consensus 
regarding the optimal approach to the number of cycles of consolidation therapy. 
The therapeutic approaches for patients who can tolerate intensive therapy are usually divided into two phases: 
induction  of  remission  and  post-remission  (consolidation)  therapy.  Although  patients  can  achieve  CR  and 
disease control after induction, patients who do not receive post remission consolidation therapy are more likely 
to relapse, usually within 6 to 9 months. Post remission therapy is recommended for patients younger than 60 
years old and for older patients who are fit for intensive therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 92/101 
 
 
 
For patients who cannot tolerate intensive induction therapy, combinations of low intensity therapy with novel 
agents such as venetoclax and glasdegib has shown improved responses and/or survival. 
Allogeneic HSCT is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with AML. However, HSCT is not a feasible 
treatment option for many patients, and the frequency of patients undergoing HSCT decreases with increasing 
age  due  to  the  increased  prevalence  of  comorbidities  and  poor  organ  function  limiting  the  benefit-risk 
assessment  of  the  procedure.  Despite  treatment  with  consolidation  chemotherapy,  and  even  HSCT,  relapse 
rates after these therapies remain high and contribute to the poor outcomes in AML. Salvage therapy following 
relapse is limited, particularly for patients who are not candidates for transplant. Intensive chemotherapy can 
offer the highest CR rates; however, its application is limited by tolerability, in particular, the high treatment-
related mortality and short remission duration. 
Maintenance therapy conducive to long-term tolerable drug administration could potentially prolong remission 
and survival in the post
consolidation setting, particularly in those with intermediate risk and high-risk disease 
as well as those who do not proceed to transplant. Despite the approval of Ceplene (histamine dihydrochloride) 
and Rydapt (midostaurin) in some countries as a maintenance therapy for AML, given the lack of convincing 
‐
benefit  (eg,  prolonging  survival,  Dohner,  2017),  maintenance  therapy  with  these  agents  is  globally  not 
considered standard of care. Effective maintenance therapy could provide an important therapeutic approach 
to treatment of patients with AML, a disease associated with short survival and a high unmet medical need. 
Current salvage therapy at time of relapse is inadequate, particularly for subjects not eligible for transplant. 
Duration of first Complete Remission (CR) is an important predictor of outcome, with longer duration of first 
CR associated with better survival. Therefore, maintaining patients in CR is an important therapeutic goal in 
AML. As most patients will relapse, effective maintenance treatment for patients who do attain remission may 
play a role in preventing relapse and prolonging OS, especially in those for whom HSCT is not feasible.  
Azacitidine  is  an  analogue  of  the  naturally  occurring  pyrimidine  nucleoside  cytidine  and  is  classified  as  an 
antimetabolite.  Vidaza,  the  injectable  formulation  of  the  same  active  ingredient  azacitidine,  is  considered  a 
standard of care for patients with AML who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy globally. Vidaza 
(Azacitidine for Injection), is approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients who are 
not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with: 
- 
intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), 
-  chronic  myelomonocytic  leukaemia  (CMML)  with  10-29%  marrow  blasts  without  myeloproliferative 
disorder, 
-  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  with  20-30%  blasts  and  multi-lineage  dysplasia,  according  to  WHO 
classification, 
-  AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. 
The oral form of azacitidine was developed to allow sustained and extended administration of azacitidine at 
lower  systemic  doses  than  can  be  practically  achieved  with  parenteral  therapy.  It  is  expected  that  an  oral 
formulation  can  be  administered  in  outpatient  settings  and  could  provide  a  more  convenient  route  of 
administration  for  patients.  The  risk  of  recurrent  injection  site  reactions  observed  when  azacitidine  is 
administered by the SC route could be reduced with the oral formulation.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Onureg was primarily supported by the pivotal Phase 3 placebo-controlled study (Study 
CC-  486-AML-001).  Study  CC-  486-AML-001  was  a  Phase  3,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral azacitidine plus BSC (n=238) vs placebo 
plus  BSC  (n=234)  as  maintenance  therapy  in  subjects  who  achieved  CR/CRi  after  induction  with  intensive 
chemotherapy with or without consolidation. Subjects with CR/CRi after treatment with hypomethylating agents 
(HMAs), subjects with good risk cytogenetics, and those who were candidates for HSCT were excluded. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study CC- 486-AML-001, the median OS was 24.7 months for the oral azacitidine group vs 14.8 months for 
the placebo group after a median follow-up time of 41.2 months based on reverse Kaplan-Meier method, with 
a clinically meaningful difference in median OS of 9.9 months with CC-486 treatment. The hazard ratio (HR) 
was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.86), indicating a 31% reduction in the risk of death for the 
oral azacitidine group.   
The median RFS was 10.2 months for the oral azacitidine group vs 4.8 months for the placebo group, in median 
RFS of 5.3 months with oral azacitidine treatment. The HR was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81), indicating a 35% 
reduction in risk of relapse or death for the oral azacitidine group. A lower death rate was observed in the oral 
azacitidine group compared with the placebo group as early as 90 days after randomization (4 [1.7%] subjects 
versus 20 [8.5%] subjects, respectively).  
The proportion of subjects surviving at the 1-year time point was 72.8% in the oral azacitidine group vs 55.8% 
in the placebo group, for a difference of 17.0%. The proportion of subjects surviving at the 2-year time point 
was 50.6% in the oral azacitidine group vs 37.1% in the placebo group, for a difference of 13.5%.  
The  probability  of  RFS  at  the  6-month  time  point  was  67.4%  in  the  oral  azacitidine  group  vs  45.2%  in  the 
placebo  group,  for  a  difference  of  22.2%.  The  probabilities  of  RFS  were  consistently  higher  for  the  oral 
azacitidine group than for the placebo group at each of the later time points (44.9% versus 27.4%, respectively, 
at 1 year and 26.6% versus 17.4% at 2 years), demonstrating durable efficacy over time for oral azacitidine 
treatment.  Sensitivity  analyses  of  OS  and  RFS  provided  support  for  the  robustness  and  consistency  of  the 
results of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Study  CC-486-AML-001  also  demonstrated  that  subjects  receiving  oral  azacitidine,  compared  with  those 
receiving placebo, had significantly lower rates of hospitalization events (0.48 events per person-year for the 
CC-486 group and 0.64 events per person-year for the placebo group; nominal p = 0.0068) and number of 
days hospitalized (7.89 days per person-year for CC-486 compared with 13.36 day per person-year for placebo; 
nominal p < 0.0001). 
The results for the secondary endpoints corroborated the results seen with the primary endpoint. 
Study AZA-MDS-003 is considered supportive of the efficacy results for oral azacitidine. The primary efficacy 
endpoint of RBC-TI with duration ≥ 56 days (8 weeks) in the ITT population was achieved in 31% of subjects 
in the oral azacitidine treatment group compared with 12% of subjects in the placebo treatment group, with a 
statistically significant difference of almost 19% (p = 0.0005). The median duration of RBC-TI among subjects 
in the CC-486 treatment group who achieved RBC-TI for at least 56 days was 11.1 months with a median onset 
of 2.4 months. The rate of achieving RBC-TI with duration ≥ 84 days (12 weeks) was significantly higher in the 
oral  azacitidine  treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  (28.0%  versus  6.4%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 94/101 
 
 
 
respectively; p < 0.0001). The median duration of RBC-TI and the median onset are consistent with the results 
of RBC-TI of ≥ 56 days. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the pivotal study CC-486-AML-001, a 9.9-month improvement in median OS in the oral azacitidine treatment 
was reached, compared to placebo. After 48 months, the survival probability was very close to each other in 
both arms and the Kaplan-Meier curves were almost overlapping from 64 months onwards. The updated OS 
data from 15 Oct 2019 and 20 Sep 2020 (providing 3 and ~14 additional months of follow-up, respectively) 
and RFS data from 15 Oct 2019 (3 additional months of follow-up) are consistent with the results from the 
earlier  data  cut  off  (15  Jul  2019)  reported  in  the  CSR,  with  unchanged  median  OS  and  RFS  and  HR  with 
additional follow-up, demonstrating the robustness of the results. Furthermore, the tail end of the updated OS 
and RFS curves showed increased separation compared with those from the earlier data cut off provided in the 
CSR.  It  is  agreed  that  the  updated  data  support  the  original  conclusion  that  oral  azacitidine  maintenance 
therapy  has  significant  impact  on  survival  and  delay  of  relapse  in  subjects  who  achieved  CR/CRi  following 
intensive chemotherapy. 
One  of  two  amendments  introduced  to  the  protocol  CC-486-AML-001  concerned  the  modification  of  the 
Inclusion Criterion #4 to change the amount of time required for subjects to be in complete remission (CR) or 
in complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) from 3 months to 4 months (± 7 days). This 
amendment  had  the  potential  to  increase  the  number  of  patients  included  in  the  trial  with  best  prognostic 
factors, that were able to maintain the response for a long period of time. However, in the applicant’s opinion 
this effect would not influence the final results of the study, because the randomization would be a guarantee 
that the proportion of patients with better prognosis would be balanced between both arms. The explanation 
provided in the applicant’s response is considered acceptable, although such amendments to the protocol can 
be considered as a limitation of the clinical trial. 
In  the  subgroup  analysis,  it  appears  that  only  in  European  population  the  effect  of  oral  azacitidine  was 
favourable. The Applicant performed additional analyses that showed that regional or racial differences in the 
OS  and  RFS  benefit  associated  with  CC-486  treatment  were  likely  due  to  larger  variability  caused  by  small 
sample size.  
Although it has been shown that in the population of subjects aged ≥ 65 years suffering from newly diagnosed 
AML with a BM blast count > 30% and not eligible for HSCT, treatment with azacitidine resulted in a median 
OS of 10.4 months, a clinically meaningful increase of 3.8 months over CCR with an increase of 12.3% in the 
1-year survival estimate over CCR, and the primary OS analysis did not meet the conventional level of statistical 
significance. 
It  would  have  been  expected  that  the  final  results  of  the  supportive  Study  AZA-MDS-003  could  provide 
confirmatory support of the efficacy and safety of oral azacitidine. However, the primary objective of the trial 
was not related to OS or RFS. The objective was to evaluate RBC Transfusion Independence (RBC-TI) in each 
of the 2 treatment groups (oral azacitidine versus placebo) in subjects with RBC transfusion-dependent anemia 
and thrombocytopenia due to IPSS lower-risk MDS. However, subjects were treated for vitamin B12 deficiency. 
This makes the interpretation of the interim results difficult.  
The extension of the treatment after relapse from 14 to 21 days of oral azacitidine in the experimental arm  
was  limited  to  a  small  number  of  patients  and  thus  it  is  difficult  to  determine  the  effect  of  the  treatment 
extension.  Nevertheless  and  especially  since  there  are  no  safety  concerns  identified  with  this  treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021 
Page 95/101 
 
 
 
extension of the dosing schedule from 14 to 21 days, in the case of disease relapse in patients with 5% to 15% 
blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, such an extension of the dosing schedule should be considered, in 
conjunction with a clinical assessment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Gastrointestinal toxicities 
Incidence in the pivotal trial: ~92% in the oral azacitidine group. 
Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation. 
Hematologic toxicities  
Incidence in the pivotal trial: ~66% in the CC-486 group. 
Symptoms: neutropenia (leading to an increased risk of infections), thrombocytopenia and anemia. 
Among AEs grade 3 and 4 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders in addition to Infections and Infestations 
were most commonly reported. 
Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  and  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  were  reasons  for  dose  reduction  and 
dose interruption. 
Myelosuppression AESIs occurred at consistent frequencies over time in both treatment groups with the highest 
frequencies observed in Cycle 13 and beyond. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  clinical  safety  of  oral  azacitidine  is  based  on  the  results  of  640  subjects  who  took  at  least  one  dose  of 
azacitidine in 11 different clinical trials. The number of patients is considered rather limited. 
In the study CC-486-AML-001, the lower exposure of the placebo group is related to the earlier relapse of the 
disease with suspension of treatment and could influence the safety results. 
The baseline hematologic values, namely hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count and platelets, are affected by 
the previous treatment with high dose chemotherapy, as a consequence the abnormal haematological finding 
may be not totally drug related. 
Upon stratification of the studied population it is possible to observe that patients ≥ 75 years old experienced 
higher  rates  of  TEAEs  leading  to  drug  interruption.  Even  so,  any  decision  to  restricted  the  indication  or 
strengthen  the  monitoring  in  these  age  group  has  to  be  taken  cautiously  considering  the  small  number  of 
subjected  included  (28  and  23  subjects  for  treatment  and  placebo  arms,  respectively  vs.  143  and  142  for 
patients between ≥ 65 to < 75 yrs). It should be noted, however, that the safety profile of azacitidine in this 
population is as expected. 
TEAEs  were  comparable  between  racial  groups  for  most  categories  and  no  discernible  effect  of  race  was 
observed.  However, the number of Asian, black or other racial groups in the oral azacitidine studies were small 
and comparisons cannot be made between racial subgroups.  
No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies with injectable or oral azacitidine have been presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/308711/2021

The  high  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  toxicities  introduces  some  uncertainty  as  regards  patient  compliance 
outside a trial and bioavailability of azacitidine when compared to SC administration.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results of the pivotal study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation 
of  survival  with  a  corresponding  delay  of  relapse  in  subjects  who  achieved  CR/Cri  following  intensive 
chemotherapy. A 9.9-month improvement in median OS and a 5.4 months median relapse-free survival in the 
oral azacitidine treatment was reached, compared with the placebo. Other secondary endpoints (time to relapse 
and time to discontinuation from treatment) as well as health related quality of life measurements were also 
supportive of the demonstrated benefit of oral azacitidine as maintenance therapy for the treatment of AML. 
Given the limited options for maintenance treatment for patients who attain remission after intensive induction 
therapy  and  for  whom  HSCT  is  not  feasible,  maintenance  therapy  with  oral  azacitidine  may  represent  a 
treatment option for this underserved patient population. Furthermore, maintaining patients in CR for as long 
as  possible  is  important  since  occurrence  of  relapse  is  universally  associated  with  short  survival  despite 
treatment with salvage therapy. 
In  the  pivotal  trial  essentially  all  patients  (92%)  in  the  oral  azacitidine  arm  experienced  gastrointestinal 
toxicities (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). Although these events appeared to be manageable, they were 
also an important reason for discontinuations and dose reductions / interruptions.  
The high incidence of gastrointestinal toxicities introduces uncertainty as regards patient compliance outside a 
trial and bioavailability of azacitidine when compared to SC administration. Hence, increased convenience of 
oral administration risks being offset by lower compliance and a more variable and unpredictable absorption 
potentially increasing the risk of AML relapse.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the clinical relevance and statistically significant results of the pivotal study, the benefit/risk balance of 
oral azacitidine can be considered favourable. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.

liposomal, Xospata and Daurismo within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Onureg is favourable in the following indication: 
Onureg is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who achieved 
complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction 
therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates for, including those who choose 
not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
The  CHMP  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following 
conditions:

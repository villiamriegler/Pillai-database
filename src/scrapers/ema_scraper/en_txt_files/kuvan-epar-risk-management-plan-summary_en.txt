PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Kuvan (Sapropterin dihydrochloride) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kuvan. The RMP details 
important risks of Kuvan, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Kuvan's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Kuvan's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kuvan should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Kuvan should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Kuvan's RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Kuvan is indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and 
paediatric patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have been shown to be 
responsive to such treatment. Kuvan is also indicated for the treatment of 
hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and paediatric patients of all ages with 
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency who have been shown to be responsive to such 
treatment. It contains sapropterin dihydrochloride as the active substance and it is given 
orally, as soluble tablets (100 mg) or as powder (100 or 500 mg), to be dissolved in water 
and drunk. 
Further information about the evaluation of Kuvan’s benefits can be found in Kuvan’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kuvan 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
II. 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Kuvan, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Kuvan's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kuvan is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Kuvan are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kuvan. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important Identified Risk #1: Hypersensitivity  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical study data, post-marketing data, literature. 
Clinical studies: Non-serious hypersensitivity cases, 
considered unrelated to sapropterin, have been reported. No 
serious events have occurred. 
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the broad SMQs for 
hypersensitivity reactions identified 328 adverse events and 
SMQ anaphylactic reaction identified 56 adverse events. Fifty-
nine events under hypersensitivity and 18 events under 
anaphylactic reaction were considered serious. 
Patients with existing hypersensitivity to the active substance 
or any excipient of Kuvan.

Important Identified Risk #2: Hypophenylalaninemia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical study data, post-marketing data, literature. 
Clinical studies: Lower levels of Phe (<120 μmol/L) were 
observed in clinical studies EMR700773-003 and PKU-006. 
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA PTs 
Phenylketonuria, Amino acid level decreased, and amino acid 
level abnormal identified 39 adverse events. Of these, 8 events 
were considered serious. 
Patients with HPA. The potential for hypophenylalaninemia 
during treatment with Kuvan is an identified risk and may 
indicate a need to increase dietary Phe intake or to decrease 
the dose of Kuvan accordingly.

Inhibitors, or levodopa 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Literature, clinical studies, non-clinical studies. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative 
search of the MAH’s Safety Database has identified a total of 
24 events of potential interaction of Kuvan: 
•  Using the MedDRA PT ‘Vasodilatation’ identified 
9 adverse events pertaining to an interaction with drugs 
using NO metabolism.  
•  Using the MedDRA PT ‘Phenylketonuria’ identified 7 
adverse events pertaining to an interaction with DHFRIs  
•  Using the MedDRA PT ‘Neurotransmitter level altered’ 
identified 8 adverse events pertaining to an interaction with 
levodopa.  
No new safety concern for this risk has been identified. 
Patients with HPA on Kuvan also taking medicinal products 
that can cause vasodilation, including those administered 
topically, by affecting nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or action 
including classical NO donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), 
isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 
molsidomin), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and 
minoxidil. Caution is recommended during concomitant use of 
Kuvan with all such medicinal products. 
Although concomitant administration of inhibitors of 
dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim) has 
not been studied, such medicinal products may interfere with 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Identified Risk #3: Interaction with vasodilators using NO metabolism, DHFR 
Inhibitors, or levodopa 
BH4 metabolism. Caution is recommended when using such 
medicinal products while taking Kuvan. Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing Kuvan to patients receiving 
treatment with levodopa. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of 
convulsion, increased excitability and irritability have been 
observed during co-administration of levodopa and 
sapropterin in BH4-deficient patients.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical study: In study PKU-001, there were reports of 
disturbance in attention, irritability and mood alteration. 
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative 
search of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA 
HLT Behaviour and socialisation disturbances identified 89 
adverse events. Of these, 17 events were considered serious. 
Patients with less than adequate control of blood 
phenylalanine will be at greatest risk. Non compliance with 
dietary restrictions will increase the risk of these disorders 
which are known complications of poorly controlled PKU.

Clinical study data, post-marketing data, literature. 
Clinical studies: Occurrence of convulsions/number of 
patients: 1/844 in PKU patients reported in study PKU-015, 
assessed unrelated to Kuvan; 1/28 (exacerbation) in BH4-
deficient patients. 
10-year Post-marketing surveillance study (Biopten®): 4 
occurrences of convulsions (2 new-onset and 2 exacerbation 
of convulsions) were reported in 27 primary BH4-deficient 
patients who were followed for 10 years.  
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA SMQ 
(Broad Convulsion) identified 67 adverse events. Of these, 58 
events were considered serious.  
Patients with underlying neurological disease who are 
receiving levodopa. In a 10-year post-marketing safety 
surveillance program for BH4-deficient patients, 3 patients 
with underlying neurologic disorders experienced convulsions, 
exacerbation of convulsions, over-stimulation, or irritability 
during co-administration of levodopa and Kuvan

Important Potential Risk #3: Epigastric ulcer 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Post-marketing data, literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA SMQs 
Gastrointestinal ulceration, Gastrointestinal perforation, and 
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage identified 72 adverse events. Of 
these, 35 events were considered serious. 
The factors, NSAIDs, H pylori, and cigarette-smoking, have 
been identified as major risk factors for peptic ulcer in 
numerous clinical and epidemiologic studies. Hypothetical 
models of multiple factor attributable risks were developed 
using population attributable risk percents calculated from 
these summary values. General population attributable risk 
percents were as follows: 24%, NSAIDs; 48%, H. pylori; and 
23%, cigarette smoking. Based on these numbers, the "no 
interaction" attributable risk model estimates that 95% of total 
peptic ulcer related risk is attributable to these factors in the 
general population. The "interaction" model attributes 89% of 
cases to these risk factors: 24%, NSAIDs alone; 31%, H. 
pylori alone; 34%, H. pylori/smoking combined. Between 
89% and 95% of peptic ulcer-related serious upper GI events 
may be attributed to NSAID use, H. pylori infection, and

oesophagus (n=1) identified a total of 61 adverse events. Of 
these, 8 events were considered serious. 
Transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter can be 
caused by foods (coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty meals), 
medications (beta-agonists, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, 
anticholinergics), hormones (eg, progesterone), and nicotine.

Clinical study data, post-marketing data, literature. 
Clinical studies (placebo-controlled and open studies): In an 
open-cohort study (Stover 2014), it was reported that 4-amino-
tetrahydrobiopterin was associated with a risk of acute kidney 
injury at highest dose.  
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA HLGTs 
Nephropathies and Renal disorders (excl nephropathies) 
identified 32 adverse events. Of these, 25 events were 
considered serious.   
According to preclinical data animals of younger age and 
animals receiving higher sapropterin dihydrochloride doses 
were at risk of toxicological effects on the kidneys.

Important Potential Risk #7: New-onset anxiety disorder 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical study data. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical study: KAMPER study (162-501, formerly 
EMR700773-001) - Psychiatric assessments include 
depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, 
autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorder, psychosis, 
ADD/ADHD, and phobia, as well as any other reported 
psychiatric condition.  
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA HLGT 
Anxiety disorders and symptoms identified 193 adverse 
events. Of these, 12 events were considered serious.  
A risk factor is a variable that precedes the outcome measure 
and that can be used to divide the population into two groups, 
highrisk and low-risk. So far, epidemiological research of 
anxiety disorders has focused on examining the influence of 
genetic factors, behavioural inhibition, negative life events 
and upbringing on the subsequent onset of anxiety. As 
reported above, genetic factors are important risk factors for 
anxiety.  
Behavioural inhibition refers to a disposition to react to new 
situations with initial inhibition, ie, avoidance of novel 
objects, crying or withdrawal to caregiver. Preliminary 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Potential Risk #7: New-onset anxiety disorder 
evidence suggests that displaying behavioural inhibition 
during childhood is associated with an elevated risk of 
developing an anxiety disorder at some point subsequently. 
Some studies have found behavioural inhibition to be a non-
specific risk factor (i.e. it was associated with all anxiety 
disorders), whereas others have found it to be a specific risk 
factor for social phobia. 
Negative life events: several epidemiological studies showed 
that the experience of violence in early life is linked with 
subsequent anxiety. The data with respect to other stressful 
life events, such as parental divorce or death of a parent, are 
inconsistent. Some studies have found such factors to be 
related to a subsequent onset of an anxiety disorder; other 
studies could not find an association. 
Upbringing: the current empirical evidence about upbringing 
and anxiety disorders is still relatively sparse. So far, social 
phobia has been linked to parental rejection and 
overprotection.

Important Potential Risk #8: Worsening psychiatric disorder 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical study data. 
Clinical study: KAMPER study (162-501, formerly 
EMR700773-001) - Psychiatric assessments include 
depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, 
autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorder, psychosis, 
ADD/ADHD, and phobia, as well as any other reported 
psychiatric condition. 
Post-marketing: As of 01 December 2018, a cumulative search 
of the MAH’s Safety Database using the MedDRA SOC 
Psychiatric disorders identified 1171 adverse events. Of these, 
159 events were considered serious. 
Taking into account the underlying disease with a wide range 
of possible behavioral changes, it is expected to have a higher 
number of cases of worsening of psychiatric disorders in the 
PKU population as compared to the general population. 
In a clinical study by Simon 2008 et al, adult patients with 
PKU were more likely to live at home and remain unmarried 
than their unaffected counterparts. Behavioral problems 
occurred most frequently in patients who were off diet, but 
there were still behavioral problems found in patients who 
stayed on diet. Mild to moderate psychiatric disturbances 
(mainly depressed mood, phobias, generalised anxiety) were 
described in a small study of early-treated patients currently 
on- or off diet (Pietz 1997).

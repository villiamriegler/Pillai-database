2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
More than 2% of the world population is chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The 
prevalence of HCV in Europe varies geographically, ranging from 0.4% to 3% in Western Europe. 
Chronic HCV infection is now a leading cause of liver transplantation and has superseded HIV 
infection as a cause of death in the United States.  Furthermore, HCV was associated with more 
than half of the estimated 18,910 liver cancer deaths in the United States in 2010 and has 
become the leading cause of primary liver cancer in Europe. 
Approximately 20% of HCV-infected individuals develop liver cirrhosis, with thrombocytopenia as 
a clinical marker of progression to more severe hepatic impairment. Once cirrhosis develops, the 
outcome is predictable in patients who are not treated with antiviral therapy: patients develop 
complications of cirrhosis, including hepatic decompensation (ascites, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding), hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. For 
patients with chronic HCV and platelet counts <100 Gi/L the prognosis is especially poor, with 
annualised incidence rates for hepatocellular carcinoma/clinical decompensation, death/liver 
transplantation, or death alone as high as 7.9%, 7.3%, and 5.3%, respectively. These yearly 
incidence rates mean that 2 out of 5 patients with chronic HCV and platelet counts <100 Gi/L will 
have a life threatening complication in the next 5 years and at least 1 out of 4 will die during the 
same period. 
Achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) is the primary goal of antiviral therapy.  It not 
only represents cure from viral infection, but also provides the prospect of changing the natural 
history of the disease.  The importance of SVR is reflected by a 4-10 fold decrease in mortality 
and a 2-4 fold decrease in the incidences of decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular 
carcinoma in HCV patients compared to patients with persistent HCV infection.  Even for patients 
who have developed hepatic decompensation, achieving SVR prior to liver transplantation can 
improve outcomes after transplantation by avoiding HCV recurrence. Peginterferon and ribavirin 
form the backbone of approved HCV antiviral therapy.  For patients with HCV genotype 1, the 
addition of a direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) protease inhibitor such as boceprevir or telaprevir to 
peginterferon and ribavirin (triple therapy) has led to SVR rates of up to 80% and has redefined 
the standard of care. Boceprevir and telaprevir are not approved for use in patients with HCV 
genotype 2 or 3, and their safety and efficacy in patients with marked thrombocytopenia have 
not been studied.   
The etiology of thrombocytopenia in HCV-infected patients is multi-fold and includes impaired 
production of endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) in the liver and platelet pooling due to 
splenomegaly.  The severity of thrombocytopenia correlates with the severity of the liver disease.  
Consequently, low platelet counts are predictive of poorer outcomes. 
Thrombocytopenia is also caused, or further aggravated, by interferon-based antiviral therapy 
due to its myelosuppressive effects.  Data from published Phase III studies for peginterferon 
alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b, which excluded patients with platelet counts <90 Gi/L, and 
<100 Gi/L, respectively, showed that approximately 20 to 30% experienced thrombocytopenia 
during treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin.  The current peginterferon labels advise that 
they should be used with caution in patients with baseline platelet counts <90 Gi/L and should be 
discontinued in patients who develop severe decreases in platelet counts.  It has been estimated 
that 6% of HCV patients are not eligible for peginterferon and ribavirin antiviral therapy due to 
thrombocytopenia.

The current clinical management of HCV-patients with thrombocytopenia receiving antiviral 
therapy relies primarily on reducing the peginterferon dose.  However, such dose reductions, 
particularly when occurring during the initial 12 weeks of antiviral treatment, are associated with 
a reduced ability to achieve the desired outcome of antiviral therapy, i.e. SVR.  In fact, data 
suggest that in patients with HCV and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, peginterferon dose 
reductions are particularly detrimental to achieving SVR. The window of opportunity to 
administer antiviral therapy is relatively short for patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and 
significant HCV-associated thrombocytopenia.  Most of them are at high risk of transitioning to 
hepatic decompensation.  Once patients have decompensated, initiation of antiviral therapy with 
peginterferon is contra-indicated due to high rates of treatment- associated side effects and low 
response rates to currently available antiviral therapies. 
The treatment of hepatitis C virus infection is an area of intense current research, with various 
anticipated improvements to available treatment options emerging. Numerous antiviral agents 
are currently in various stages of development, most with the ultimate goal of achieving a 
successful and safe interferon–free treatment regimen.  Until interferon-free treatment regimens 
become available, IFN remains as the backbone of antiviral regimens in HCV. 
Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist. It interacts with 
the TPO-R and induces proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow 
progenitor cells to increase platelet counts. 
Eltrombopag is currently indicated in the treatment of adult patients with ITP not candidates or 
after failure to splenectomy. The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily. For patients of East 
Asian or South East Asian ancestry, eltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced dose of 25 mg 
once daily and the maximum allowed is do not exceed a dose of 75 mg daily. 
The MAH submitted a variation to extend the indication for the treatment of adult patients with 
chronic hepatitis C infection for the treatment of thrombocytopenia: 
• To enable the initiation of interferon-based therapy; and 
• During interferon-based therapy 
The proposed starting dose is 25 mg eltrombopag once daily for all patients. After initiating 
eltrombopag, the dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve/maintain the minimum target 
platelet count necessary to maintain full-dose antiviral therapy, up to a maximum dose of 100 
mg eltrombopag once daily. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product is presented as tablets containing one new strength of eltrombopag olamine 
equivalent to 75 mg of eltrombopag as active substance. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied also for the 100 mg strength; however the 
application was withdrawn during the evaluation since problems were encountered during the 
validation process of the 100 mg strength. The Quality information of the withdrawn strength 
was similar to the one provided for the 75 mg strength.

Other ingredients are: magnesium stearate, mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose, povidone 
(K30), sodium starch glycolate Type A, hypromellose, iron oxide red (E172), iron oxide black 
(E172), iron oxide yellow (E172), macrogol 400, and titanium dioxide (E171). 
The product is available in aluminium blisters (PA/Alu/PVC/Alu) as the already authorised 
strengths. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Eltrombopag olamine used for the manufacture of Revolade 75 mg film-coated tablets is of the 
same quality as the one used for the already authorised strengths. The applicant submitted a 
Type IA variation to reduce the limit for the potentially genotoxic oxime isomer impurities from 
20ppm to 5ppm. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Revolade 75 mg strength was developed to support the additional proposed indication for the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with HCV infection. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied also for the 100 mg strength; however the 
application was withdrawn during the evaluation since problems were encountered in the 
validation process of the 100 mg strength.   
All the excipients, except for the colorants, are controlled by the appropriate Ph Eur monograph. 
The formulae for the colorants mixtures and the specifications applied were provided and 
considered satisfactory. No compatibility issues were identified between the active substance and 
the excipients employed in the finished product 
The finished product is an immediate release tablet dosage form that employs a common 
granulation to make tablets of different strengths; therefore, the particle size of the granule will 
impact the finished product content uniformity and must be controlled. Since the active 
substance has a low solubility, the active substance particle size will have an impact on tablet 
dissolution. Granulation is the only critical step identified. For all steps, both quality critical 
process parameters (QCPP) and quality process parameters (QPP) are defined by an acceptable 
range of values (defined as the Proven Acceptable Range) or by the desired end point. 
The new strength 75mg is manufactured using a common granule as with the 25mg and 50mg 
tablets, so no new statistical design of experiments was performed on this critical process, but 
further process validation was performed on the blending and compression processes. 
Eltrombopag olamine has a low solubility over the pH range 1 to 7.4.  It is considered to have 
moderate permeability so the bioavailability may be considered to be limited by its dissolution 
rate.  Because of its low solubility, a dissolution method was developed using a surfactant. 
The primary packaging used for the 75mg is the same as that used for the 25mg and 50mg 
tablets, that is polyamide / aluminium foil / polyvinyl chloride (PVC) laminate blister which is

sealed with aluminium foil, nominally 20µm thick with a vinyl acrylic heat seal coating.  The 
product contact materials are the PVC and acrylic coating. Appropriate specifications applied by 
the product manufacturers have been provided together with supplier documentation indicating 
that the PVC complies with the PhEur and with the European Directive for contact with food. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of this new strength.

Manufacture of the product 
The finished product manufacturing process covers dry mixing of ingredients, granulation, wet 
milling, drying, milling blending (pre-lubrication and lubrication), compression, coating and 
packaging and it is the same manufacturing process as the one used for the already authorised 
strengths. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications are identical to the already authorized strengths and   
include appropriate tests for description, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), related impurities 
content (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution (Ph Eur), and microbiological test 
(Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results in 5 full-scale batches confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture 
and indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data was provided for 48 months at 30 °C / 65% RH and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH 
for two commercial scale batches, for the 25mg, 50mg and 75mg strength tablets, in the 
proposed packaging.   
Supporting stability data was provided for 48 months at 30 °C / 65% RH and 6 months at 40 °C 
/ 75% RH for three commercial scale batches, in the proposed packaging.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of this new strength Revolade 75 mg 
tablets has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A number of additional nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies have 
been completed since the initial marketing application was submitted.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The effects of eltrombopag and TPO recombinant on cell proliferation of hepatocellular cancer 
(HCC) cell lines (Hep3B, Huh-7 and HepG2) and normal liver samples were investigated. 
Following treatment with recombinant TPO there was a small, but statically significant 
proliferative response in the Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines. Treatment with eltrombopag induced a 
dose-dependent decrease in proliferation with a mean of IC50 of 5.6, 26.1 and 15.9 μg/mL for 
the HepG2, Hep3B and Huh-7 cell lines, respectively. 
The expression of the gene which encodes for TPO-R (MPL) mRNA was measured in HCC cell 
lines, patient-derived HCC and normal liver samples. MPL mRNA expression was very low, but 
detectable in the Hep3B, Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines; undetectable in HCV patient liver samples 
and higher in normal liver samples. TPO-R protein was also detected in the HCC cell lines. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three new pharmacokinetic studies have been submitted that are relevant for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic HCV infection: 
An in vitro investigation of the role of organic anion transporter polypeptides in the hepatic 
uptake of [Ring-U-14C]SB-497115 using isolated human hepatocytes. 
This study was conducted to investigate eltrombopag uptake into human hepatocytes in vitro. 
[14C] eltrombopag was incubated with cryopreserved human hepatocyte culture and its uptake 
by the hepatocytes, as measured by cellular radioactivity content, was determined in the 
absence and presence of an inhibitor cocktail of uptake transporters (rifamycin, montelukast, 
cyclosporine A and ketoconazole). This study demonstrated that eltrombopag transport into 
human hepatocytes was passive and nonsaturable, and that the uptake transporter inhibitors had 
no effect on the hepatic uptake. These results were consistent with a previous finding that 
eltrombopag was not a substrate of human OATP1B1. Hepatitis C viral infection has been shown 
to alter expression of hepatic transporters, including uptake transporters. Because the uptake of 
eltrombopag into hepatocytes is passive, uptake into hepatocytes of HCV patients should not be 
affected. 
Qualitative investigation of the metabolites of eltrombopag (SB-497115) in human plasma 
following oral administration of eltrombopag olamine (50 mg) in healthy subjects and in subjects 
with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 12/112 
 
  
  
This was a study to qualitatively compare circulating metabolites in patients of renal impairment 
with healthy subjects. Plasma samples from a clinical study were analysed by LC/MS for 
eltrombopag and its metabolites. No notable differences were observed in circulating metabolite 
profiles between healthy and renally impaired subjects. The human radiolabel study indicated 
that metabolites derived from oxidation and glucuronidation of eltrombopag circulated at low 
levels in healthy humans. Therefore, renal impairment alone should not notably alter circulating 
metabolite profiles in HCV patients. 
An in vitro investigation into the inhibition by SB-497115 (eltrombopag) of doxorubicin and 
doxorubicinol transport via human breast cancer resistance protein heterologously expressed in 
MDCKII cells. 
This report described an in vitro study to characterize the effect of eltrombopag on breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (a metabolite of 
doxorubicin). Eltrombopag is an inhibitor of BCRP, of which both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol 
are substrates. In a polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line heterologously expressing 
human BCRP, eltrombopag up to 30 μM had no effect on BCRP-mediated transport of doxorubicin 
or doxorubicinol. These results indicated a low potential of clinical interaction of eltrombopag 
with the anthracycline and its metabolite. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Other toxicity studies 
One toxicology study has been conducted with eltrombopag. This study provides an in vitro 
assessment of the genotoxic potential of the impurities GSK1719938A and SB-433049. 
A reassessment of the route of synthesis for eltrombopag identified several potential genotoxins: 
SB-611855-AAB, SB-601205, SB-564758, GSK560666A, SB-710620-A, GSK1719938A and SB-
433049. With the exception of the additional impurities GSK1719938A and SB-433049, these 
potential genotoxins are the same as those highlighted in the initial marketing application for 
ITP. 
GSK1720079A (a mixture of the isomers GSK1719938A and SB-433049 as pure preparations of 
these molecules could not be prepared) was evaluated in a screening Ames test using Salmonella 
typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA pKM101), in 
both the presence and absence of S9-mix and in concentrations ranging between 50 to 5000 
μg/plate.  
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 13/112 
 
  
  
GSK1720079A induced mutation in strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100 when tested in 
the presence of S9-mix and TA98, TA100 and WP2 uvrA pKM101 when tested in the absence of 
S9-mix. 
Analysis of the eltrombopag drug substance confirmed that the levels of each of these potential 
impurities at the recommended clinical dose are below 1.5 μg/day, the threshold of toxicological

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
For eltrombopag where the maximum recommended daily dosage is 100 mg/day, PECsurface water 
was 0.5 µg/L. Upon CHMP request the PECSURFACE WATER value was refined with information for the 
sum of all the indications including the sales forecast of Revolade. The refined PECsurface water was 
0.069 µg/L. This value is greater than the nominal trigger value of 0.01 µg/L and therefore a 
Phase II environmental was performed. 
In a phase II Tier A assessment, eltrombopag was investigated for determination of activated 
sludge sorption isotherm according to OPPTS 835.1110. Due to physico-chemical characteristics 
of the compound, no determination of the isotherm was possible in this study and a Phase II Tier 
B assessment was performed. See Table 1 for a summary of the studies performed. 
Finally, the distribution coefficient for eltrombopag is 4.52 at ph=7 and it has been screened for 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Eltrombopag has been considered persistent because 
the degree of ultimate biodegradation has been insignificant (14%, 28 days) and the parent 
compound has proved recalcitrant to primary degradation (10%, 28 days), but it does not fulfil 
the criterion for bioaccumulation (BCF=14) in a fish concentration study (OECD 305).

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress the CHMP recommends the update of the ERA including the following points for further 
investigation: 
-Tier A: Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediments system (OECD 308), Daphnia 
sp. reproduction test (OECD 211) and Fish, early life stage toxicity test (OECD 210) 
-Tier B: Aerobic transformation in soil (OECD 307), Soil microorganisms, nitrogen transformation 
test (OECD 216), Terrestrial plants, growth test (OECD 208), Earthworm, acute toxicity test 
(OECD 207), Collembola reproduction (ISO 11267) and Sediment - water chironomid (OECD 
218/219).  
In addition, the following standard sentence was added in the Package Leaflet as a precautionary 
measure until the studies have been performed: “Do not throw away any medicines via waste 
water or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. 
These measures will help protect the environment.” 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Eltrombopag is a trombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist that functions in a similar manner to 
endogenous trombopoietin (TPO). Eltrombopag induces survival, proliferation and megakaryocyte 
differentiation activities in human bone marrow progenitors. Eltrombopag has no direct effect on 
in vitro platelet aggregation or activation, nor does it influence agonist-dependent aggregation or 
activation. 
Safety pharmacology studies submitted as part of the initial marketing authorisation application 
did not reveal any adverse neurobehavioral, respiratory or cardiovascular effects in vivo at the 
highest doses tested. However, the doses tested did not result in exposure levels in animals 
compare to humans enough to discard the risk for patients with HCV infection treated with 100 
mg of eltrombopag (~3-fold for neurobehavioral or respiratory systems and 1.2 for 
cardiovascular system). No clinically significant effects on cardiac repolarization were observed in 
clinical trials in healthy subjects and patients with HCV, but other cardiovascular damage, as 
thrombotic events and proarrhythmia, have been associated with eltrombopag treatment. 
Nevertheless the CHMP agreed that additional in vivo non clinical studies with higher doses of 
eltrombopag were not warranted based on the MAH’s justification that dose higher than 30 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

mg/kg/day could not be well tolerated by the animals. Further assessment of cardiac 
repolarization has been performed on a clinical level and the risk of thrombosis is currently 
adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
Taking into account the proposed indication is for patients with hepatic damage, the MAH has 
discussed the clinical relevance of hepatic effect found in animals in HCV patients and review the 
available data on possible adverse effects of eltrombopag treatment on liver seen using models 
with hepatic disease. Hepatotoxicity has been observed in mice and rats generally associated 
with non-tolerated doses. It was considered a secondary effect of eltrombopag rather than a 
primary toxicity. In dogs, short treatment (4-14 days) with high doses of eltrombopag (≥60 
mg/kg/day) induced hepatocellular degeneration/necrosis and/or apoptosis associated with 
marked increases from baseline values in serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase or total 
bilirubin. No similar findings were observed in dogs after 52 weeks of dosing at a maximum 
tolerated dose of 30 mg/kg/day. In addition, a review of recent literature on nonclinical models 
of HCV-related liver disease showed that there are no suitable animal models currently available 
to evaluate possible effects of eltrombopag treatment on liver. 
Since animal models for the study of possible effects of eltrombopag treatment on liver of HCV 
are not available and the risk in humans is already known and it is included in the current SmPC, 
the CHMP was of the opinion that further studies were not necessary to characterise the 
hepatotoxicity associated with eltrombopag treatment from the non-clinical point of view. 
According to the data submitted in the initial marketing application, eltrombopag is considered 
not genotoxic, not carcinogenic, not phototoxic and it does not affect the fertility. However, the 
doses tested did not allow a safety margin to exclude risk for HCV patients treated with 100 
mg/day of eltrombopag. The safety margin was 6.8 (rat bone marrow micronucleus test) for 
genotoxic potential, below 2 for carcinogenic potential and 1.8 fold in mice/1.9 in rats for 
photoxicity. In addition low safety margins have been obtained for teratogenic effects in rats and 
rabbits and the development risk for humans cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, additional 
studies were not warranted because higher doses would not be tolerated by the animals. In this 
regard the SmPC currently describes the risk adequately. It states that mice and rats do not fully 
model potential adverse effects related to the pharmacology of eltrombopag in humans due to 
the TPO receptor specificity and safety margins are adequately described (see SmPC section 
5.3). 
Eltrombopag is not a PBT substance. The refined PEC surface water calculated for the maximum 
daily dose of 100mg exceeds the trigger value for a Phase II environmental fate and effects 
analysis. An activated sludge sorption isotherm was not determined for eltrombopag due to 
instability problems, but a QSAR (PCKOC) evaluation of eltrombopag predicts that Koc will be 
significantly greater than 10,000 (Log Koc = 5.66). The CHMP was of the opinion that the risk to 
the environment has been properly assessed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Eltrombopag has been well characterised in a comprehensive battery of nonclinical studies that 
support the clinical use of eltrombopag in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection for the treatment of thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The effect of the co-administration of eltrombopag and IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin or IFN alfa-2b 
plus ribavirin was studied by performing population PK analyses. An eltrombopag population PK 
model was developed using eltrombopag plasma concentration-time, dosing, demographic and 
covariate data collected from one Phase II pilot study in subjects with HCV infection (TPL102357) 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

Page 17/112 
 
 
 
  
  
and two Phase III studies (TPL103922 [ENABLE I] and TPL108390 [ENABLE II]) in subjects with 
HCV infection, combined with data from a healthy subject study (SB497115/002, N=28). 
Population PK model 
Of the 663 subjects included in the population PK analysis, 28 were healthy subjects and 635 
were HCV patients. The median (range) age across the 663 subjects was 52.0 (19.0-74.0) years, 
and 403 subjects (61%) were male. There were 144 elderly (>60 years) subjects (22%) in the 
population. The median (range) body weight was 75.0 (41.0-164.0) kg. Of the 663 individuals, 
362 subjects (55%) were White, 12 (2%) were Black or African-American, 145 (22%) were East 
Asian, 69 (10%) were South East Asian, 74 (11%) were Central/South Asian and 1 (<1%) were 
classified as Other. 
Of the 635 HCV patients included in the population PK and PK/PD analyses, 605 subjects (95%) 
were classified as Child-Pugh Class A (Child-Pugh score of 5-6, mild hepatic impairment), 27 
(4%) as Child-Pugh Class B (Child-Pugh score of 7-9, moderate hepatic impairment) and none as 
Child-Pugh Class C (Child-Pugh score of 10-15, severe hepatic impairment).  
The parameter estimates of the final PK model are presented in Table 2. There were a number of 
significant covariates identified.  CL/F of eltrombopag was, on average, 29% lower in female 
subjects compared to males, 27% lower in elderly (>60 years) compared to younger subjects, 
and on average, 36% lower in East/Southeast Asian subjects compared to other races who are 
predominantly Caucasian. CL/F in subjects with a Child-Pugh score of 5 was estimated to be, on 
average, 50% lower than healthy subjects. As the severity of the hepatic impairment increased 
there was a further reduction in CL/F. For a patient with Child-Pugh score of 9, CL/F was 
estimated to be 71% lower compared to a patient with a Child-Pugh score of 5. CL/F was 
negatively correlated to AST levels. Vc/F was estimated to be 2.3-fold higher in Central/South 
Asians compared to all other races. For the range of weights in the analysis population (41-164 
kg), Vc/F and Vp/F ranged from 7.1- 28.3 L and 12.7-50.6 L, respectively. For an average AST 
level in the HCV population of the current analysis (102 IU/L), CL/F value was estimated to 
decrease by 18% compared to HCV patients with normal AST (20 IU/L). All of the fixed effect 
parameters were estimated with good precision (%RSE <24%). The inter-individual and inter-
occasional random effects were also estimated with reasonable precision, with %RSE less than 
12%. 
The final model was evaluated by performing a VPC stratified by study and dose. Only 9% of the 
observed concentrations fell outside the 90% prediction intervals, supporting the conclusion that 
the final model adequately describes the observed data.

Table 2. Parameter estimates of final eltrombopag population PK model 
The individual post-hoc parameter estimates were derived for all subjects in the PK dataset and 
to further characterize the difference in eltrombopag PK across various sub-populations, 
individual predicted steady state CL/F, Cmax, AUC(0-τ), and half-life (t1/2) were derived 
following repeat dosing of once daily 50 mg eltrombopag, and summarized by population in this 
model. Consistent with the final PK model, plasma eltrombopag exposure is higher in subjects 
with HCV compared to healthy subjects. For repeat daily dose of 50 mg eltrombopag, the 
geometric mean AUC(0-τ) and steady state Cmax in all HCV patients were 3.1 and 2.3-fold 
higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of eltrombopag was 
also significantly longer in HCV patients due to their reduced clearance (CL/F). Within HCV 
patients, exposure is higher in both females and East/Southeast Asians, and elderly subjects 
(>60 years) due to their lower CL/F. The terminal half-life of eltrombopag derived from the final 
PK model for both healthy subjects and HCV patients (52.2 and 122 h, respectively) was longer 
than that previously reported for both healthy subjects and subjects with CLD (21.1 and 76.4 h, 
respectively). The estimates of the typical values of both CL/F and Q/F from Model 104 were in 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013

close agreement with those previously reported (0.938 vs. 0.953 L/h; 0.615 and 0.633 L/h). 
However, the estimates of the typical values for both volume terms (Vc/F and Vp/F) from the 
present analysis were higher than those previously reported, particularly for the peripheral 
volume term which was double the estimate from the CLD analysis (21.6 vs. 9.41 L).  
A summary of eltrombopag PK parameter estimates by population is shown in Table 3. 
Table 3. Summary of individual posterior eltrombopag PK parameter estimates by population 
A statistical analysis was undertaken to evaluate the effect of IFN alfa-2a and IFN alfa-2b on 
eltrombopag CL/F using a mixed effects model approach (Treatment as a fixed effect and Subject 
as a random effect) which showed that there was an estimated 9% and 11% drop in the CL/F of 
eltrombopag when IFN alfa-2a and alfa-2b were co-administered with eltrombopag, respectively. 
The ratios (90% CI) for the effect of IFN alfa-2a and IFN alfa-2b were estimated to be 0.910 
(0.851-0.974) and 0.887 (0.823-0.956) (Table 4). The 90% CI for both the comparisons were 
within the 80 to 125% limit of the standard bioequivalence criteria suggesting that there were no 
clinically meaningful differences in the CL/F of eltrombopag with and without administration of 
IFNs.

Table 4. Summary of statistical analysis to assess impact of antiviral therapy on eltrombopag 
Cl/F 
In order to further assess the impact of more severe hepatic impairment on eltrombopag 
clearance (CL/F) and to test the impact of age on CL/F, the MAH provided upon CHMP request a 
combined PK population analysis including data from the previous HCV (ENABLE-based) and the 
CLD (ELEVATE-based) population PK analyses. 
A total of 742 subjects were included in the combined PK dataset (28 healthy volunteers, 635 
patients form the HCV studies and 79 patients from the CLD studies [38 of which were HCV 
patients]). Most of the subjects were males (61%), Child-Pugh Class A (90%) and the mean age 
was 52 years (range 19-81 years). Eleven percent (n=79) of the subjects were 65 years old or 
above, with very few subjects ≥75 years of age (n=4). 
The combined model confirmed both, age and hepatic impairment, as significant covariates. The 
previously identified covariates remained significant as well. With regards to hepatic impairment, 
simulations performed with the combined model indicate that eltrombopag CL/F decreases with 
increasing degrees of hepatic impairment, assessed by Child-Pugh Scores. Therefore, the 
combined model confirmed that exposure increases with increasing hepatic impairment, as 
previously predicted. The estimated increase in exposure, compared to healthy subjects, was 
111-183%, for subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. 
Plasma eltrombopag concentration-time data collected in 590 subjects with HCV enrolled in 
Phase III studies TPL103922/ENABLE 1 and TPL108390/ENABLE 2 were combined with data from 
patients with HCV enrolled in the Phase II study TPL102357 and healthy adult subjects in a 
population PK analysis. Plasma eltrombopag Cmax AUC(0-τ) estimates for patients with HCV 
enrolled in the Phase 3 studies are presented for each dose studied in Table 5.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
An eltrombopag population PK/PD model was developed using platelet count over time and 
eltrombopag dosing from the Phase II (Study TPL102357) and the Phase III (ENABLE 1 and 
ENABLE 2) studies were combined with the individual PK parameters obtained from the 
population PK model. The population PK/PD model was built using a non-linear mixed-effect 
modeling approach with NONMEM program version VII.  
Population PK/PD Model for Eltrombopag without and with Interferon 
The final dataset for the eltrombopag PK/PD model consisted of 1567 platelet observations from 
633 subjects.  The structural PK/PD model for eltrombopag was the same as that previously 
developed for subjects with CLD. As higher dose levels were used in this study, this allows the 
relationship between plasma eltrombopag concentrations and the stimulation of platelet 
production in the thrombocytopenic HCV subjects to be described by the Emax model. The 
parameter estimates are shown in Table 6. 
Table 6. Parameter estimates of eltrombopag population PK model 
The typical estimates for KIN and KT were 10.6 Gi/L/day and 0.667 day-1, respectively. The 
maximal stimulatory effect was 15.4 and the associated EC50 was 29 μg/mL. The IIV for KIN and 
EC50 was 43.0 and 80.9%, respectively. The structural parameters for the model were estimated 
with reasonable precision, with %RSE less than 30%. The diagnostic plots for the final model 
indicated that the model adequately described the platelet count data for the thrombocytopenic 
subjects with HCV during the eltrombopag dose escalation phase of the studies, although there 
was a slight under-prediction of the higher observed platelet count data. The distribution of the 
random effects was close to normal and no strong unexplained covariate-parameter relationships 
were noticeable. 
The eltrombopag PK/PD model was evaluated by performing a VPC, only 8% of the observed 
platelet concentrations fell outside the 90% prediction intervals.  
The simulations of the eltrombopag dose escalation phase of the ENABLE 1 and 2 underestimated 
the percentage of subjects who would qualify for initiation of antiviral therapy after two weeks of 
receiving 25 mg eltrombopag QD. However, the subsequent predictions at Weeks 4, 6 and 9 
were closer to the observed data. The simulations also predicted that, on average, only 3 and 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

Page 22/112 
 
 
  
  
5% of the HCV subjects would have failed to initiate antiviral therapy in ENABLE 1 and 2, 
respectively, which is almost identical to the actual study results. 
The final model included separate models for the inhibitory effects of IFN alfa-2a and 2b therapy 
on platelet counts. Due to a lack of PK data for IFN, a KPD modelling approach was used (see 
Figure1). As with the eltrombopag PK/PD model, there was an under-prediction of the higher 
platelet counts. 
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the KPD model for eltrombopag and Peg-IFN in 
thrombocytopenic patients with HCV 
The parameters estimates of PEG-INF alfa-2a and 2b population KPD model are shown in Tables 
7 and 8.

Table 8. Parameter estimates of PEG-IFN alfa-2b population KPD model 
The stimulatory effect of eltrombopag on platelet production was not shown to vary between 
different subpopulations. This is in contrast to the results obtained from a similar analysis in 
subjects with CLD (72 and 11% were identified as having HCVB and C aetiology, respectively), in 
which East Asian subjects were found to be less sensitive to the stimulatory effect of 
eltrombopag. In the analysis for CLD population, the majority of East Asian subjects were from 
one Japanese study. It is possible that the estimated racial effect on the platelet response was 
confounded by the difference or variability between different studies involved in that analysis. 
Simulations 
A number of simulations were performed in order to assess the impact of alternate eltrombopag 
dosing regimens prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy and during the course of antiviral 
therapy. 
Simulation indicated that steady-state platelet response was achieved between Week 5 and 
Week 6 following once daily dosing of eltrombopag (see Figure 2). Approximately 30% of the 
steady-state platelet response was achieved after 2 weeks dosing, and approximately 60% of 
steady-state platelet response was achieved after 3 weeks dosing.

Figure 2. Median platelet count vs. time in thrombocytopenic HCV subjects following QD 
eltrombopag treatment for 10 weeks 
Simulated platelet response following eltrombopag regimens of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 
and 100 mg once daily is proposed to support eltrombopag 25 mg once daily as an appropriate 
initial dose. The simulation predicted that approximately 45% (35%) of patients would achieve 
platelet counts >90 Gi/L (>100 Gi/L) following once daily dose of 25 mg eltrombopag for 2 
weeks, enabling initiation of antiviral therapy (90 Gi/L for IFN alfa-2a and 100 Gi/L for IFN alfa-
2b). Of these patients, approximately 97% would maintain platelet counts <200Gi/L. 
Similar results were predicted across different subpopulations, with slightly higher proportion of 
East/Southeast Asian patients, 57% (47%), than non-East/Southeast Asian patients, 43% 
(32%), achieving platelet counts >90 Gi/L (>100 Gi/L) following 2 weeks of once daily dose at 
25 mg eltrombopag, however the proportion of patients with platelet counts <200 Gi/L was 
comparable (94 to 98%) across subpopulations. 
Simulation with a starting dose of 25 mg eltrombopag once daily followed by biweekly dose 
escalation up to 100 mg once daily were performed. In these simulations, the dose of 
eltrombopag was allowed to increase, in 25 mg increments up to a maximum of 100 mg, if the 
platelet count was predicted to be <60 Gi/L and to decrease in increments of 25 mg if the 
platelet count was predicted to be >200 Gi/L. Three different scenarios were simulated: platelet 
counts were evaluated once weekly, once every two weeks or once every three weeks. The dose 
of the pegylated IFN remained unchanged (180 μg/week for IFN alfa-2a or 1.5 μg/kg/week for 
IFN alfa-2b) during the course of the simulation. 
Simulations indicated that approximately 50% of subjects required at least one eltrombopag 
dose adjustment during antiviral therapy to maintain sufficient platelet counts. Subjects who 
initiated antiviral therapy at the lowest eltrombopag dose of 25 mg were more likely to stay on 
the same dose through the antiviral therapy, whereas subjects who initiated antiviral therapy at 
75 mg were more likely to require further eltrombopag dose escalation to 100 mg during antiviral

therapy. More frequent dose modification appeared to cause more subjects to be escalated to the 
higher eltrombopag doses.  Finally, the results of simulations at the steady state which occurs 6 
weeks post the last eltrombopag dose adjustment are shown in Table 9.

Drug-drug interaction study (TPL116010) 
A drug-drug interaction (DDI) between eltrombopag and boceprevir or telaprevir has been 
initiated. The study evaluated the interaction between a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg and 
repeat doses of boceprevir 800 mg Q8h (Cohort 1) and telaprevir 750 mg Q8h (Cohort 2) in 
healthy adult subjects. Preliminary results suggested no interaction between eltrombopag and 
boceprevir or telaprevir (Tables 10 and 11). Results of the impact of eltrombopag on plasma 
boceprevir PK are not yet available.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the mean estimated PK parameters were similar to those published in literature. Certain 
subpopulations (females, elderly, East/Southeast Asian subjects) and HCV subjects with a Child-
Pugh Score > 5 showed a lower CL/F, which translates into higher eltrombopag exposure. The PK 
parameters of pegylated IFN alfa-2a and alfa-2b were similar to what was already reported in the 
literature. The co-administration with eltrombopag did not show an impact on the PK of either 
IFN. 
The influence of East Asian ethnicity (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Thai) 
on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis in 635 patients with HCV (145 East Asians and 69 Southeast Asians). Based on 
estimates from the population pharmacokinetic analysis, East Asian patients had approximately 
55 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-τ) values as compared to patients of other races who 
were predominantly Caucasian. 
The influence of gender on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population 
pharmacokinetics analysis in 635 patients with HCV (260 females). Based on model estimate, 
female HCV patient had approximately 41 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-τ) as compared to 
male patients (see SmPC section 5.2). 
The influence of age on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population 
pharmacokinetics analysis in 28 healthy subjects, 673 patients with HCV, and 41 patients with 
chronic liver disease of other aetiology ranging from 19 to 74 years old. There are no PK data on 
the use of eltrombopag in patients ≥ 75 years. Based on model estimate, elderly (≥ 65 years) 
patients had approximately 41 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-τ) as compared to younger 
patients.

Data from the ELEVATE study were included in the model in order to have more subjects with a 
greater degree of hepatic impairment. The combined model confirmed both, age and hepatic 
impairment, as significant covariates. In addition, the MAH has also provided additional data on 
eltrombopag plasma exposure from HCV patients with and without hypoalbumemia (albumin<35 
g/L). Based on the provided PK estimates and the observed safety profile, the CHMP agreed that 
the use of eltrombopag in patients with moderate-severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh score >5) 
should not be recommended. The SmPC has been updated to reflect the recommendations for 
eltrombopag use in subjects with hepatic impairment, including those with hypoalbuminemia. 
Moreover data available on patients with moderate-severe renal impairment is scarce and this 
fact has been appropriately reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.2). 
The impact of age on eltrombopag CL/F was also re-evaluated on the combined model. Age 
remained a relevant covariate. The number of subjects ≥75 years old was small (n=4) and no PK 
data is available for subjects ≥85 years old. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see 
section 5.2). 
Results of a drug-drug PK interaction study show that co-administration of repeat doses of 
boceprevir 800 mg Q8h or telaprevir 750 mg Q8h with a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg did 
not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure to a clinically significant extent. Co-administration of a 
single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg with telaprevir 750 mg Q8h did not alter plasma telaprevir 
exposure. No information on the effect on boceprevir exposure is yet available (see SmPC 
section 4.5 and Benefit-risk balance). This data was considered important to address the safety 
and efficacy of eltrombopag in combination with new direct acting agents and has been included 
in the RMP as missing information. The applicant will provide post-authorisation the final results 
of the drug-drug interaction study of eltrombopag with boceprevir and telaprevir (TPL110610), 
and it has been reflected in the PhV plan of the RMP as category 3 (required additional 
pharmacovigilance activity). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The effect of the co-administration of eltrombopag and IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin or IFN alfa-2b 
plus ribavirin was studied by performing population PK analyses. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) data showed that repeat, once daily dosing led to platelet count 
increases after 8 days of dosing, and a maximal platelet count response was achieved 
approximately 2 weeks after the start of dosing. A PK/PD model estimated that 54% of subjects 
would require an eltrombopag dose of 100 mg to maintain a platelet count >80 Gi/L during 
peginterferon therapy. 
The simulations provided by the MAH are comprehensive for the current recommended posology 
prior to and after initiation of antiviral therapy with IFN. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The primary evidence for the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in the treatment of adult 
patients with HCV-associated thrombocytopenia is provided by two  Phase III double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies, TPL103922 (ENABLE 1) and TPL108390 (ENABLE 2). The design of 
both studies followed the advice received from the EMA prior to initiating the Phase III studies. 
An additional phase II supportive dose-finding study was submitted.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
TPL102357 Study 
Methods 
Study TPL102357 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, dose-
ranging, parallel group, Phase II pilot study in male and female subjects with HCV infection and 
platelet counts of 20 to <70Gi/L who were otherwise eligible to begin treatment with 
peginterferon and ribavirin.  
Approximately 160 subjects were planned to be randomized equally (1:1:1:1) into one of four 
treatment groups of 40 subjects. Stratification was according to baseline platelet count (20 to 
<50 Gi/L and ≥50 to <70 Gi/L). Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age with chronic HCV 
(defined as the presence of HCV antibodies and detectable HCV RNA) who had compensated liver 
disease and pre-existing thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 20 to <70 Gi/L) were recruited. 
Subjects were required to have a liver biopsy indicative of chronic hepatitis, or radiographic 
evidence of cirrhosis or endoscopic evidence of portal hypertension. 
The study was conducted in two phases, Parts 1 and 2. In Part 1, study subjects were 
randomized to eltrombopag (30, 50, or 75 mg daily) or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects who 
successfully completed Part 1 (achieved a platelet count ≥ 70Gi/L for Pegasys or platelet count 
≥ 100Gi/L for PEG-Intron at Day 28) proceeded to Part 2. In Part 2, subjects received an 
additional 8-12 weeks of eltrombopag or placebo administered daily with antiviral therapy 
(peginterferon and ribavirin). At the completion of Part 2, subjects could continue to receive 
antiviral therapy per standard of care at the discretion of the investigator. Platelet counts were 
measured throughout the study and 4 weeks after the last dose of double-blind study 
medication. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag on platelet counts 
when administered once daily for 4 weeks (Part 1, Pre-antiviral Therapy Phase) to subjects with 
chronic HCV-related thrombocytopenia, prior to receiving antiviral therapy. Secondary objectives 
included evaluation of the following: effects of eltrombopag on platelet counts when administered 
once daily for 12 weeks during antiviral therapy (Part 2), effects of eltrombopag on markers of 
thrombopoiesis when administered once daily for 16 weeks, effects of eltrombopag on antiviral 
treatment outcome measures during and after antiviral therapy, safety and tolerability of 
eltrombopag when administered once daily for 16 weeks, and population pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile of eltrombopag when administered once daily for 16 weeks to subjects with chronic HCV. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a shift from baseline platelet count 
(between 20 and <70Gi/L) to ≥100Gi/L after 4 weeks (Part 1, pre-antiviral phase) of 
administration of eltrombopag prior to receiving antiviral therapy. For the purpose of the primary 
analysis, missing platelet count data from Weeks 2 to 4 in Part 1 was replaced with the previous 
observation, i.e. the last observation was carried forward (LOCF). 
The study was initiated on 5 April 2005 in Europe and the USA. The study was originally planned 
with no interim analysis, except for a blinded review of safety and tolerability by an IDMC when 
40 subjects completed Part 1. After the study began, Protocol Amendment 02 was implemented 
on 25 August 2005 which stipulated performing a formal interim analysis on the Part 1 data. The 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

interim analysis was conducted to assess treatment effect with the purpose of supporting a 
possible extension of the treatment period to 48 weeks. The interim analysis, conducted on 8 
November 2005, included subjects who had completed 4 weeks of treatment or were withdrawn 
as of October 2005. The number of subjects included in the interim analysis was 33. 
As a result of this first interim analysis, plasma levels of eltrombopag were found at a higher 
level in HCV-infected subjects than previously documented in healthy volunteers. The 
eltrombopag exposures observed were between the NOAEL and the level where cataracts were 
observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents. As a result of this unexpected finding, the 
sponsor decided to suspend further enrolment into this study as of 22 December 2005 while 
additional PK/pharmacodynamic analyses were undertaken to better understand the exposure-
response relationship and to try to identify if there were any underlying factors (e.g. decreasing 
liver function) that might explain the high exposure findings.  
Subsequent inconclusive PK data generated from the first interim analysis resulted in Protocol 
Amendment 03 being implemented on 9 March 2006 to conduct a full analysis of Part 1 and Part 
2 data from all subjects enrolled as of 22 December 2005 (N=74). This full analysis of all data 
collected in-house as of 2 June 2006 was planned to determine whether the data from additional 
subjects would provide sufficient evidence to permanently stop the study for efficacy or safety. 
Results from this analysis showed a statistically significant treatment effect on platelet response 
after 28 days of eltrombopag alone (p<0.0001). As a result of reaching the pre-defined statistical 
stopping criteria for efficacy, the sponsor officially terminated enrolment to this study on 23 June 
2006. 
The 74 subjects contained in the second and final analysis continued to be followed-up until the 
all subjects’ 6 month post-treatment ocular assessment had been performed. The database for 
this study was frozen on 30 November 2006. The final results presented are based on the 30 
November 2006 database. 
Results 
Subjects in the ITT Population had a median age of 51 years and 52 (70%) subjects were male. 
Most subjects (64 subjects, 86%) were White/Caucasian/European heritage. The four treatment 
groups were generally balanced with regard to demographic characteristics (see Table 12).

In Part 1, 25 subjects (34%) were withdrawn from the study. Most of the withdrawals were from 
the placebo group due to lack of efficacy and the fewest were from the 75mg treatment group. 
At all treatment visits, the highest response rate was observed in the eltrombopag 75mg group 
(see Table 13). 
Table 13. Responders by Visit in Part 1: ITT Population (LOCF Data)  
In Part 1 (prior to antiviral treatment), subjects with a baseline platelet count of 50 to <70Gi/L 
had higher response rates compared to subjects with a baseline platelet count of 20Gi/L to 
<50Gi/L. The number and percentage of responders to treatment in Part 1 in the per protocol 
and ITT populations using the Observed dataset (adjusting for baseline platelet count strata) was 
similar to that in the ITT Population using the LOCF dataset.  
The mean change in platelet count from baseline was analysed using ANCOVA adjusting for 
baseline platelet count strata in the ITT Population (Observed Data). The mean change from 
baseline in platelet count with eltrombopag treatment increased in a dose-dependent manner at 
the Week 4 Visit (see Figure 3). There was a significant change from baseline in platelet counts 
compared to placebo at each dose of eltrombopag at the Week 4 Visit; results were -3.5, 119.9, 
151.7 and 186.4 Gi/L for placebo, 30, 50 and 75 mg groups, respectively.

The proportion of subjects who were responders with a platelet count >200Gi/L increased in a 
dose-dependent manner with eltrombopag treatment; results were 0, 25, 47, and 52% at the 
week 4 visit for placebo, 30, 50 and 75 mg groups, respectively. Once platelet values exceeded 
200Gi/L, subjects were instructed to interrupt treatment until the platelet count dropped below 
approximately 100Gi/L. 
In Part 2, subjects were to receive an additional 8 to 12 weeks of eltrombopag or placebo 
administered daily during antiviral therapy. The median platelet counts decreased during the 
antiviral treatment phase compared to the pre-antiviral phase, however they remained above the 
median baseline platelet counts in each eltrombopag treatment group (see Figure 4).

Results of other endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects with any peginterferon dose reductions decreased with 
increasing doses of eltrombopag. 
The viral load (average serum HCV RNA) was reduced following initiation of antiviral 
therapy in a dose-dependent manner.  
The number of subjects with a viral response (>2 log 10 reduction from baseline 
assessment to endpoint assessment or undetectable HCV RNA at endpoint assessment) increased 
in a dose-dependent manner. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two pivotal Phase III studies investigating the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with HCV were conducted. ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2 
were both multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, with identical 
study designs, differing only in the pegylated interferon (peginterferon) used.

Figure 5). 
Figure 5. Study Schematic of Pivotal Studies ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2 
• 
Part 1 Pre-Antiviral Treatment Phase (OL Phase): All subjects received OL eltrombopag 
dosed once daily with the objective of increasing platelet counts to ≥90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or 
≥100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2). Subjects started with a dose of eltrombopag (25 mg once daily) for 
2 weeks. If after this time the platelet count was <90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or <100 Gi/L 
(ENABLE 2), subjects underwent a sequential dose escalation to the next highest dose (50 
mg once daily for up to 2 weeks), with further dose escalations to 75 mg once daily (up to 
2 weeks) and 100 mg once daily (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) to achieve a platelet count 
≥90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or ≥100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2). Once subjects achieved platelet counts ≥90 
Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or ≥100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2), they were eligible to enter the randomised part 
of the study (Part 2) and initiate antiviral therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a (ENABLE 1) or 
alfa-2b (ENABLE 2) plus ribavirin). Subjects with platelet counts <90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or 
<100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2) after the 9 week Pre-Antiviral Treatment Phase were discontinued 
from eltrombopag and switched to post-treatment follow-up visits.

• 
Part 2 DB Antiviral Treatment Phase (DB Phase): The overall aim of Part 2 was to avoid 
dose reductions of antiviral therapy due to thrombocytopenia by optimising the dose of 
eltrombopag/matched placebo. Subjects were randomised 2:1 to either continue on the 
same dose of eltrombopag from Part 1 or received a matched placebo. Both treatments 
were given in combination with antiviral therapy for up to 48 weeks. In combination with 
ribavirin, the recommended dose of peginterferon alfa-2a is 180 μg per week, and that for 
peginterferon alfa-2b is 1.5 μg/kg per week; for genotype 2/3, 24 weeks treatment was to 
be given, for genotype non-2/3, 48 weeks of antiviral therapy. Subjects eligible to enter 
Part 2 of the study were instructed by study personnel on how to self administer the first 
dose of peginterferon at the Antiviral Treatment Phase baseline visit. Administration was 
by subcutaneous injection. Dose modifications of eltrombopag/matched placebo were 
permitted to maintain platelet counts at a level that enabled continuation of antiviral 
therapy, ideally at full dose, by allowing increases in the eltrombopag/matched placebo 
dose up to 100 mg once daily. Any dose modifications of peginterferon alfa-2a/alfa-2b or 
ribavirin were performed as directed within the product labels. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag treatment on sustained virologic 
response (SVR) in thrombocytopenic subjects (platelets <75 Gi/L) with HCV infection. 
The secondary objectives were 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
to evaluate the ability of eltrombopag to enable initiation of antiviral therapy in 
thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection 
to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag on platelet counts in thrombocytopenic subjects with 
HCV infection, before and during antiviral therapy 
to evaluate the effects of eltrombopag treatment on antiviral treatment outcome measures 
(rapid virologic response [RVR], early virologic response [EVR] and end of treatment 
response [ETR]) in thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection 
to evaluate the ability of eltrombopag to enable maintenance of antiviral therapy in 
thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered once daily in 
thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection 
to evaluate the impact of eltrombopag on subject reported symptoms and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) using the chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ)-HCV and the 
Medical Outcomes Study Short-form 36 version 2 acute recall (SF-36v2) 
to describe the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag and explore the relationship between the 
PK of eltrombopag and relevant safety and efficacy endpoints  
to describe the PK of peginterferon alfa-2a/b during concomitant dosing with eltrombopag.  
Data published after the initiation of the ENABLE studies reported that genetic variants, 
rs12979860 and rs8099917, which map near IL28B are associated with IFN-induced SVR in 
patients with chronic hepatitis C. Therefore, a genetic analysis was conducted to evaluate if there

Page 35/112 
 
 
 
  
  
were any differences in the distribution of IL28B favourable response genotypes between 
subjects receiving placebo versus subjects receiving eltrombopag and to evaluate the association 
of the published IL28B favourable response genotypes with virologic response. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
SVR rate defined as percentage of subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at end of treatment and 
all subsequent planned visits up to 24 weeks after completing treatment (generally Weeks 48 or 
72 for genotype 2/3, or Week 72 for genotype non-2/3). If a subject had a positive HCV RNA 
(“blip”) between two visits with undetectable HCV RNA, then the subject was considered a 
sustained virological responder provided that the detectable HCV RNA was of the same order of 
magnitude as the limit of detection. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
Initiation of antiviral therapy: platelet shift from baseline count to ≥ 90/100 Gi/L with OL 
eltrombopag; proportion of subjects initiating antiviral therapy; time to initiation of 
antiviral therapy 
• 
Antiviral therapy dose reductions: proportions of subjects requiring dose reductions and/or 
dose cessation of peginterferon and/or ribavirin therapy; time to the first antiviral therapy 
dose reduction 
• 
Adherence to Antiviral Therapy: proportion of subjects showing adherence (defined as 
receiving at least 80% of the prescribed dose of peginterferon and of ribavirin, for at least 
80% of the planned duration)  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Platelet counts with antiviral therapy: assessment of platelet counts throughout the study 
Other Antiviral Endpoints: proportions of subjects achieving the following antiviral outcome 
measures  
undetectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks of antiviral treatment (cEVR)  
clinically significant reduction in HCV RNA (≥ 2 log10 drop or undetectable) after 12 weeks 
of antiviral treatment (EVR) 
undetectable HCV RNA after 4 weeks of antiviral treatment (RVR) 
undetectable HCV RNA at the end of antiviral treatment (ETR). 
Pharmacogenetic investigation: to determine that the IL28B genotype frequencies do not 
differ between the study treatment populations and if IL28B variants (rs12979860 and 
rs8099917) affect PEG-IFN alfa/RBV-induced virological response (SVR and RVR) in 
subjects treated with eltrombopag to enable the use of PEGIFN/RBV for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C. 
Platelet count eligibility (<75 Gi/L), confirmed at the baseline visit (Day 1) prior to administration 
of eltrombopag, was defined as the average of the screening and baseline counts. Up to 1 
additional platelet count assessment was allowed between screening and baseline and in those 
cases the average of the 3 counts had to be <75 Gi/L for the subject to be eligible.

For subjects who prematurely withdrew, HCV RNA Viral Load was assessed at the 24 week follow 
up visit. The Hepatitis C Viral RNA quantitative transcription-mediated amplification was used to 
quantitate the level of HCV RNA in serum or plasma (down to the level of 5 IU/mL).  
Sample size 
Determination of the sample size was based on the following assumptions: the proportion with 
SVR with placebo will be 10%; the study would have 92.5% power to detect a statistically 
significant treatment effect of 10% at two-sided alpha=5%; there would be three interim 
analyses and one final analysis; Haybittle-Peto criteria would be used to protect against 
increasing the type I error rate with repeated interim analyses; treatments would be allocated on 
a 2:1 ratio of eltrombopag to placebo. 
A total of 675 subjects (450 on eltrombopag and 225 on placebo) were required to be 
randomised. It was estimated that approximately 10% of subjects would not complete the pre-
antiviral treatment phase. Therefore, 750 subjects would be enrolled in order to randomise 675 
subjects. 
Randomisation 
All subjects received OL eltrombopag during Part 1 of the study. Prior to initiating antiviral 
therapy in Part 2, eligible subjects were randomised to either continue the eltrombopag dose 
from Part 1, or, matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio of eltrombopag: placebo in accordance with the 
randomisation schedule. Study centres registered and randomised subjects by telephone using 
an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The IVRS was available 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week. The OL eltrombopag and the DB eltrombopag/placebo supplies were managed through the 
IVRS. 
Randomised treatment was given to the investigator or his/her designee through a mechanism 
which maintained the blind. Once allocated, a randomisation number was not reassigned to 
another subject. 
Blinding (masking) 
During Part 1 of the study, eltrombopag treatment was open label. During Part 2, 
eltrombopag/matched placebo treatment (but not dose) was blinded to the research subjects and 
all study and sponsor personnel. Treatment blind was maintained by the use of matching 
eltrombopag placebo tablets. The antiviral therapy was open label. Only in the case of an 
emergency, when knowledge of the study treatment was essential for the appropriate clinical 
management or welfare of the subject, was the investigator or treating physician permitted to 
unblind a subject’s treatment assignment via IVRS (preferably after discussion and agreement 
with the Medical Monitor or appropriate GSK study personnel). Where the blind was broken for 
any reason, the investigator was required to notify the MAH immediately of the unblinding 
incident without revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment, unless considered relevant 
to the safety of subjects in the study. 
GSK’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance staff could unblind the treatment assignment 
for any subject with a serious adverse event (SAE). If the SAE required that an expedited 
regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying

the subject’s treatment assignment, was sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local 
regulations and/or GSK policy. 
Statistical methods 
The ENABLE studies were monitored by an Independent Drug Monitoring Committee (IDMC). 
Three formal interim analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were planned: after 25%, 50%, 
and 75% of the subjects in each study had completed all their follow-up visits. The p-values and 
confidence intervals (CI) reported for the primary analyses were adjusted for the interim 
analyses. 
Except where otherwise noted, the statistical model on which inference was based included terms 
for the strata: HCV genotype (genotype 2/3, non-genotype 2/3), baseline platelet count (<50 
Gi/L and ≥50 Gi/L), baseline HCV RNA (<800,000 IU/mL and ≥800,000 IU/mL). The primary 
endpoint was analysed separately for subgroups of geographic region, and various demographic 
and baseline disease characteristics. 
Analysis populations 
• 
• 
Enrolled Population: subjects who had passed screening and entered the study. 
Safety population: subjects who had received OL study drug. The Safety population is a 
subset of the Enrolled population. The Safety population was used for the following 
objectives: 
o 
o 
to evaluate the ability of eltrombopag to enable initiation of antiviral therapy; 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag. 
• 
ITT population: all randomised subjects. Subjects were analysed according to the stratum 
and treatment they were assigned at randomisation, regardless of whether it was assigned 
correctly. The ITT population was a subset of the Safety Population and was the primary 
population for the analysis of efficacy during the DB Phase. 
• 
Safety Double-Blind (DB) population: all randomised subjects who received DB study drug. 
Subjects were analysed as treated, i.e. according to the treatment received. The Safety DB 
population was a subset of the ITT population. The Safety DB population was used to 
compare the safety of eltrombopag (plus antiviral therapy) with placebo (plus antiviral 
therapy). 
• 
Per-Protocol (PP) population: all randomised subjects who did not violate any important 
inclusion and exclusion criteria that pertained to the assessment of treatment efficacy, and 
who incurred no protocol deviations that pertained to the assessment of treatment 
efficacy. The PP population, identified prior to unblinding of the study, was used to analyse 
the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint. 
Missing data 
For the primary analysis, if a subject had a missing value between visits, then the previous non-
missing HCV RNA assessment and associated classification was carried forward to fill in the 
missing value. If a subject’s HCV RNA at 24 week follow-up assessment was missing for any 
reason, the subject was considered a non-responder. A subject with missing data due to 
premature discontinuation of treatment, or from the study for any reason was considered a non-
responder for all subsequent visits.

Primary efficacy analysis 
The proportion of subjects with SVR was summarised by treatment group, and were compared 
between eltrombopag and placebo using stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test 
statistics adjusting for HCV RNA genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV 
RNA stratum (randomisation strata). The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of treatment effect 
was used to evaluate the relevant interactions. The model-adjusted absolute difference in 
proportions and associated 95% CI were estimated. The estimate was derived using general 
linear modelling with the SAS GENMOD procedure. The dependent variable was SVR (yes/no) 
and the independent variables were actual stratification factors as well as treatment. The 
binomial distribution with identity link function was specified.  
Secondary efficacy analyses 
• 
Initiation of antiviral therapy: Platelet counts with OL eltrombopag were summarised using 
descriptive statistics for different levels of platelet cut off points. The proportion of subjects 
initiating antiviral therapy as well as the time to initiation of antiviral therapy was 
summarised. Endpoints related to initiation of antiviral therapy were analysed for the 
Safety Population. 
• 
Antiviral therapy dose reductions: Subjects were assigned a score equal to the number of 
times their dose of antiviral therapy, either peginterferon or ribavirin was reduced. The 
proportions of subjects in each category were summarised by treatment group. The 
treatment groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, adjusting for HCV 
genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation 
strata). Time to the first antiviral therapy dose reduction (peginterferon) was analysed 
using the stratified log-rank test adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count 
stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Kaplan-Meier plot of time 
to first peginterferon dose reduction was produced. 
• 
Adherence to Antiviral Therapy: Adherence has been defined as receiving at least 80% of 
the prescribed dose of peginterferon and at least 80% of the prescribed dose of ribavirin, 
for at least 80% of the planned duration (38 weeks for subjects with 48 weeks of planned 
treatment and at least 19 weeks for subjects with 24 weeks of planned treatment). The 
proportion of subjects showing adherence was analysed using stratified CMH chi-square 
test statistics adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline 
HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Descriptive statistics for the association of 
adherence to antiviral therapy with SVR was computed. The strength of association was 
assessed using the chi-square tests for association. 
• 
Permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy: The proportion of subjects who 
discontinued from antiviral therapy (peginterferon) for any reason was analysed using 
stratified CMH chi-square test statistics adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count 
stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Time to permanent 
discontinuation of antiviral therapy was analysed using stratified log-rank test adjusting for 
HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum. Kaplan-
Meier plot of time to permanent discontinuation of peginterferon was produced. Reasons 
for permanent discontinuation were summarized by randomised treatment group. 
• 
Platelet counts with antiviral therapy: Descriptive statistics were provided for platelet 
counts over time, change from baseline over time (i.e., at each scheduled visit), and 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 39/112 
 
  
  
changes from antiviral baseline over time. Durability or duration of platelet response 
(count achieved to allow initiation of antiviral treatment) was defined as the time in weeks 
from antiviral baseline to the first time platelets became <50 Gi/L. 
• 
Platelet counts with antiviral therapy after stopping DB study drug: Analysis of platelet 
counts after stopping double blind study drug were summarised using descriptive statistics 
or frequency counts as appropriate. 
Other Antiviral Endpoints: The other antiviral endpoints were rapid virologic response (RVR), 
extended rapid virologic response (eRVR), early virologic response (EVR), end of treatment 
response (ETR), and virologic response at end of treatment as well as 12 week follow-up 
assessment. These were analysed for the ITT population using stratified CMH chi-square test 
statistics, adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA 
stratum wherever applicable.

This amendment was requested by Health Canada to exclude subjects with any prior history 
of arterial or venous thrombosis, irrespective of associated risk factors. 
Protocol deviations 
In ENABLE 1, 6% of subjects were excluded from the PP Population; the exclusions were mainly 
due to evidence of decompensated liver disease (defined as a CP score >6) at baseline and this 
was similar between treatment groups (see Table 14).  
Table 14. Summary of Reasons for Exclusion from the PP Population (ENABLE 1) 
In ENABLE 2, 5% of subjects were excluded from the PP Population; again the exclusions were 
mainly due to evidence of decompensated liver disease at baseline and this was similar between 
treatment groups (see Table 15).

HCV FibroSURE is a noninvasive blood test that combines the quanitative results of 6 serum 
biochemical markers (α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, bilirubin, γ-glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT), and ALT), with a subject’s age and gender to generate a measure of 
fibrosis/cirrhosis and necroinflammatory activity in the liver. It provides a numerical quantitative 
estimate of liver fibrosis ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 corresponding the the Metavir scoring system 
of stages F0 to F4 (F0=no fibrosis, F1=portal fibrosis, F2=bridging fibrosis with few septa, 
F3=bridging fibrosis with many septa, F4=cirrhosis). A high proportion of subjects had FibroSURE 
score equivalent to Metavir F3 or F4, indicative of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis. 
Subjects were stratified at baseline by platelet count, HCV RNA and genotype (see Table 17). The 
proportion of subjects in each stratum was evenly distributed across the treatment groups. 
Table 17. Summary of Actual Baseline Stratification Variables (ENABLE 1, ITT Population) 
Patients who have been previously treated with interferon are associated with poorer antiviral 
response. A similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups had received prior HCV 
medications and the majority of these had received combination antiviral therapy (i.e. 
IFN+Ribavirin) (see Table 18).

Table 25. Univariate Analysis of Sustained Virologic Response for Actual 
Strata for Subjects with Successful Response (ITT Population) 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint using the PP population, and 
assessing the impact of using all assessments, of late treatment discontinuations and missing for 
other reasons, of LOCF, of using 24 week follow-up visit only, of using actual visits, of not using 
LOCF, and of using 12 week follow-up visit or later as LOCF for 24 week follow-up visit. Only the 
analysis using HCV RNA assessments at the actual end of treatment visit, 12 Week follow-up visit 
and 24 Week follow-up visit, regardless of the duration of treatment or the actual time relative to 
randomisation in ENABLE 2 showed a non-significant treatment difference in SVR rate (of 5%) 
between eltrombopag and placebo. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
Initiation of antiviral therapy 
Results on initiation of antiviral therapy and increase in platelet counts to required level with are 
shown in Tables 26 and 27.

Table 26. Initiation of Antiviral Therapy (Safety Population) 
Table 27. Increase in Platelet Counts to Required Level with Open-label Eltrombopag (Safety 
Population) 
The majority of subjects achieved a platelet count >90/100 Gi/L within 4 weeks; the mean 
number of weeks required was 2.4 in ENABLE 1 and 2.8 in ENABLE 2.  
A total of 2% of subjects in each study achieved the required platelet counts to initiate antiviral 
therapy but did not randomize to Part 2 (DB). There was no pattern in the reasons for this failure 
to initiate therapy within or across the studies. 
• 
Antiviral therapy dose reductions 
Results on antiviral dose reductions are shown in Tables 28 and 29 and Figure 6.

Table 29. Premature Discontinuation from Antiviral Therapy (ITT Population) 
The commonest reasons for premature discontinuation of antiviral therapy were adverse events 
(27% placebo, 19% eltrombopag; the difference being mainly due to an increase in events of 
thrombocytopenia in placebo-treated subjects), and lack of antiviral efficacy.  
• 
Adherence to Antiviral Therapy 
Adherence to antiviral therapy are summarised in Table 30. 
Table 30. Adherence to Antiviral Therapy (Pooled Data, ITT Population) 
 Adherence to antiviral therapy (defined as receiving at least 80% of the investigator-prescribed 
dose of peginterferon alfa-2b and at least 80% of the investigator-prescribed dose of ribavirin, 
for at least 80% of the planned duration) was associated with at least a doubling of the 
proportion achieving SVR, both for placebo and eltrombopag. 
• 
Platelet counts with antiviral therapy 
The results on platelet counts with antiviral therapy are shown in Figure 7 and Tables 31 and 32.

platelet count >200 Gi/L (compared with 14% of those on placebo). Comparative figures for 
ENABLE 2 have not been provided.  
• 
Other Antiviral Endpoints 
Other antiviral endpoints are shown in Table 33. 
Table 33. Other Antiviral Endpoints (ITT Population) 
In both studies, the results at the early antiviral milestones of RVR and eRVR were similar 
between the eltrombopag and placebo treatment groups and did not show any statistically 
significant difference in response. 
• 
Pharmacogenetic investigation 
A total of 906/1441 subjects, who were White and Asian subjects identified as non- Hispanic or 
Latino, were included in the combined PGx analysis population. No difference was detected in 
carriage frequencies for IL28B response genotypes between subjects randomized to the placebo 
and eltrombopag treatment groups in the DB portions of these studies (see Table 34).  
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

Page 53/112 
 
 
 
  
  
Table 34. Distribution of Subjects with IL28B Genotypes in the Placebo and Eltrombopag 
Treatment Groups (Pooled Data, Combined PGx Analysis Population) 
A higher proportion of subjects achieved SVR in the eltrombopag treatment group than in the 
placebo treatment group. This result occurred for subjects carrying all IL28B genotypes. 
However, subjects who carried the IL28B favourable response genotype were more likely to 
achieve virologic responses than were subjects who did not carry the favourable IL28B genotype 
in both the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups. This trend was observed in subjects 
infected with any HCV genotype (see Table 35).  
Subjects homozygous for the favourable response allele, ‘C’, of the IL28B polymorphism 
rs12979860 (i.e., subjects that carry 2 copies of the ‘C’ allele, ‘CC’) are more likely to achieve 
SVR compared to patients who carried one or no copy of this allele. Although both IL28B variants 
showed strong evidence for statistical association with virologic response, evaluating the effect of 
each marker conditioned upon the effect of the other indicated that rs12979860 represents the 
primary association with treatment response and the association with rs8099917 is secondary. 
Analysis by viral genotype was performed in the Combined and in the White PGx Analysis sub-
populations. Subjects infected with either HCV non 2/3 or 2/3 genotypes who carried the IL28B 
favourable response genotype were more likely to achieve virologic responses than were subjects 
who did not carry the favourable IL28B genotype. The strength of association between the IL28B 
response genotype was strongest in patients with baseline HCV non-2/3 genotypes 
(predominantly genotype 1; viral genotypes known to be less responsive to IFN/RBV treatment) 
compared with patients with either genotypes 2 or 3 (viral genotypes typically more responsive 
to IFN/RBV treatment).

The Applicant conducted an integrated analysis of pooled data from the pivotal studies. The 
studies were similar in design, the main difference being the type of peginterferon used, and the 
lower platelet threshold for dose adjustments. The results of the integrated analysis reflect the 
findings of the individual studies.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No specific studies have been provided. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Thrombocytopenia associated to the HCV infection is a limiting factor for the access to a 
potentially curative therapy. The reason is that thrombocytopenia is a common AE of the 
currently available regimens and treatment related thrombocytopenia is one of the critical factors 
that may compromise the completion of an optimal HCV treatment regimen, which is a pre-
requisite for achieving a successful outcome. Therefore, any therapy able to allow patients to 
initiate and complete an optimal antiviral treatment are expected to increase the rates of 
sustained viral responses (SVR), which is a surrogate marker of the ultimate goal of treatment, 
i.e. to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to the chronic C hepatitis infection. 
Results from the dose finding study TPL102357 support a 25 mg starting dose of eltrombopag. In 
this study 75% of HCV-infected subjects receiving the lowest dose of eltrombopag (30 mg) 
achieved platelet counts >100 Gi/L after the initial 4-week pre-antiviral dosing period. Study 
TPL102357 used eltrombopag doses of 30, 50 and 75mg. 
Platelet counts generally began to increase within 1 week of starting eltrombopag. The aim of 
treatment with eltrombopag should be to achieve the minimum level of platelet counts needed to 
initiate antiviral therapy, in adherence to clinical practice recommendations. During antiviral 
therapy, the aim of treatment should be to keep platelet counts at a level which prevents the risk 
of bleeding or the need for interferon dose reductions (50,000/µl). Platelet counts > 100,000/µl 
should be avoided. The lowest dose of eltrombopag needed to achieve the targets should be 
used. Dose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response. 
Based on the data provided by the MAH the following posology was agreed and reflected in the 
SmPC:   
Initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily. No dosage adjustment is necessary for HCV 
patients of East Asian ancestry or patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Adjust the dose of eltrombopag in 25 mg increments every 2 weeks as necessary to achieve the 
target platelet count required to initiate anti-viral therapy. Monitor platelet counts every week 
prior to starting antiviral therapy. On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet count may fall, so 
immediate eltrombopag dose reductions should be avoided. 
During antiviral therapy, adjust the dose of eltrombopag as necessary to avoid dose reductions 
of peginterferon due to decreasing platelet counts that may put patients at risk of bleeding (see 
Table 2). Monitor platelet counts weekly during antiviral therapy until a stable platelet count is 
achieved, normally around 50,000-75,000/µl. CBCs including platelet counts and peripheral blood 
smears should be obtained monthly thereafter. Dose reductions on the daily dose by 25 mg 
should be considered if platelet counts exceed the required target. Wait 2 weeks to assess the 
effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments. 
Do not exceed a dose of 100 mg eltrombopag once daily.

reinitiating dosing at 25 mg every other day. 
♦  - On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet count may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose 
reductions should be avoided. 
If after 2 weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 100 mg the required platelet level to initiate antiviral 
therapy is not achieved, eltrombopag should be discontinued. 
Eltrombopag treatment should be terminated when antiviral therapy is discontinued unless 
otherwise justified. Excessive platelet count responses or important liver test abnormalities also 
necessitate discontinuation. 
Two pivotal Phase III studies were submitted to support the efficacy of eltrombopag in the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic, compensated HCV and advanced fibrosis 
or cirrhosis. ENABLE 1 and 2 used a different peginterferon, but otherwise had a similar design. 
The design of the studies was appropriate, with an open-label, dose titration phase to establish 
efficacy in initiation of antiviral therapy, followed by a randomised, double-blind, placebo 
controlled antiviral phase (peginterferon alfa-2a/b plus ribavirin). The duration of the double-
blind phase was dependent on the HCV genotype. The primary endpoint was the proportion 
achieving sustained virologic response (percentage of subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at 
end of treatment and all subsequent planned visits up to 24 weeks after completing treatment). 
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects initiating antiviral therapy, requiring an 
antiviral dose reduction, adhering to antiviral therapy, and the platelet count during antiviral 
therapy. 
Regarding the primary endpoint, treatment with eltrombopag produced a statistically significant 
absolute increase in the SVR rate of 8% in ENABLE 1 and 6% in ENABLE 2 over placebo. The 
other secondary endpoints were generally supportive of the efficacy of eltrombopag. In the 
double-blind treatment phase the rate of antiviral dose reductions in those on eltrombopag was

EMA/491212/2013 
Page 59/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
40% that of placebo-treated subjects. Correspondingly, the average time to requirement for a 
dose reduction was slightly prolonged in those on eltrombopag, and fewer patients required 
premature discontinuation of antiviral therapy. Adherence to antiviral therapy was higher in 
eltrombopag-treated subjects, and was shown to be related to a higher probability of achieving 
SVR. 
For all the important subgroups evaluated, the ENABLE studies demonstrated that eltrombopag 
use in combination with interferon-based HCV antiviral therapy results in an improvement in SVR 
compared to interferon-based therapy alone (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Protease inhibitors were not licensed in the EU until late 2011, and could not therefore have been 
incorporated into the ENABLE studies. In addition, they are only licensed for subjects with HCV 
genotype 1, and were not investigated in those with platelet counts of less than 90 Gi/L. The 
protease inhibitors also exacerbate the thrombocytopenic effects of interferon-based therapy, 
suggesting that their use would be limited in patients with significant thrombocytopenia at 
baseline. To date only preliminary PK results from a drug-drug interaction study to investigate 
the potential for interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors boceprevir and 
telaprevir have been presented to support its use in association with HCV triple therapy including 
direct acting antiviral agents. Full results are not yet available and are awaited but preliminary 
results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag. However these 
results are unable to rule out potential safety concerns when combining these treatments. 
Therefore, at this stage the use of eltrombopag in patients receiving triple therapy including 
protease cannot be recommended and this has been clearly reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Additional efficacy and safety data in these patients will be investigated by the MAH post-
authorisation as reflected in the PhV plan of the RMP which includes 3 Post-Authorisation Safety 
Studies (PASS) (category 3, required additional pharmacovigilance activity). 
Additional expert consultation 
The Scientific Advisory Group on HIV/Viral Diseases (SAG-HIV/Viral Diseases) was convened on 
2 July 2013 to discuss the benefits of afatinib from a clinical perspective. 
The SAG-HIV/Viral Diseases provided advice on the following questions raised by the CHMP: 
1.  Is there a place in therapeutics for eltrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in 
patients with advanced HCV-liver disease otherwise candidates to antiviral therapy to allow 
initiation and maintenance of a full IFN-based regimen? 
2.  In the light of the safety findings, do you consider that a positive benefit/risk balance could 
be concluded for the whole studied population, in particular in those patients with the 
poorest prognostic i.e. thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic liver disease, as 
defined by low albumin levels (<35g/L) or MELD score ≥10. 
3.  Subject to a positive answer to the previous one, could you discuss on the conditions for use 
under which a positive benefit/risk balance could be concluded. 
The SAG addressed the points raised by the CHMP in the joint response below: 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 60/112 
 
 
  
  
The SAG agreed by consensus that there is public health need and a place for eltrombopag in the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with advanced HCV-liver disease, although very 
restricted. Indeed, a small number of patients where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main 
reason for which an interferon (IFN)-based regimen is not feasible, could benefit from 
eltrombopag as its efficacy in treating thrombocytopenia would allow initiation and maintenance 
of a full interferon (IFN)-based regimen. Currently there aren’t any treatment options available 
for this very advanced patient population since antiviral regimen cannot be initiated due to 
thrombocytopenia. 
Indeed, while the SAG recognised that the use of eltrombopag was accompanied by a worrisome 
safety profile and that the rapid progress of HCV therapies might allow for IFN free regimens in 
the near future, the experts supported the use of this compound in a very limited population in 
which with the current practice an IFN-based regimen is not possible. The SAG defined this 
population as patients with advanced HCV-liver disease, in need of IFN-based therapy, and for 
whom the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor that limits the initiation or the ability to 
maintain the IFN-based treatment. 
The experts acknowledged that in patients with the poorest prognostic i.e. thrombocytopenic 
patients with advanced chronic liver disease, as defined by low albumin levels (<35g/L) or MELD 
score ≥10, the benefits were less pronounced and the risks more significant. Nevertheless they 
considered the risk/benefit balance positive.  However, they stressed the fact that adequate 
information should be provided to the prescribers to warn them of the increased risks and/or 
decreased efficacy which has been observed during the eltrombopag trials. In this regard the 
increased risk in portal vein thrombosis in these patients should be highlighted. 
Moreover, due to the complexity in the treatment of such advanced patient population, the SAG 
was of the opinion that eltrombopag should be prescribed only by very experienced physicians in 
the treatment of HCV. 
Finally, the SAG recommended the conduct of further studies on the use of eltrombopag, in 
particular the group agreed that there was a need to understand the safety and efficacy of 
eltrombopag as part of a triple therapy (IFN + ribavirin + direct-acting anti-viral agent). In 
addition, the long term benefits of achieving SVR, although described in the current literature, 
haven’t been demonstrated in the data provided and should be confirmed post-authorisation.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary, the results of the ENABLE studies provide evidence for the efficacy of eltrombopag 
in allowing initiation of antiviral therapy in thrombocytopenic HCV patients with compensated 
advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and demonstrate a modest benefit for the outcome of sustained 
viral response rate due to antiviral therapy. The patient group studied represents a cohort of 
HCV sufferers with severe disease and no treatment options since antiviral regimen cannot be 
initiated due to thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the treatment effect, though modest, represents 
an appreciable benefit.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of eltrombopag in combination with interferon-based antiviral therapy is supported by 
data from the 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies (ENABLE 1 and 2), and 
supportive data from the randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase II study TPL102357.

The MAH presented upon CHMP request during the D120 List of question revised tables for 
adverse events identified during the double blind phase, including on treatment plus 6 months 
follow-up period (data not shown). The results of the new analyses supported the conclusion of 
the on-treatment plus 30 days follow-up analyses previously presented. 
In addition, a summary of adverse drug reactions observed for eltrombopag during treatment 
where causality was based on comparative incidence in clinical trials, 1 % higher incidence in the 
eltrombopag arm compared to placebo arm, is shown in Table 42.

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Serious adverse events identified during the double blind phase, including on treatment plus 30 
day follow-up period, are shown in Table 43:

Table 43. SAEs During the Double-Blind Phase in ≥0.5% Subjects in Either Treatment Group 
(Safety DB Population) 
Deaths 
In the open label phase there were 2 deaths. 
•  One subject experienced an SAE of hepatorenal syndrome on study Day 46, and died the 
same day. This subject had current medical history of cirrhosis, hypertension, and 
myocardial ischemia. The subject was interferon naive. Baseline platelet count was 20 Gi/L 
and baseline MELD score was 15. The subject received open-label eltrombopag 25 mg daily 
for 2 weeks. Eltrombopag was increased to 50 mg/day on Day 15 (platelet count 39 Gi/L), 
to 75 mg daily on Day 29 (platelet count, 35 Gi/L), and to 100 mg daily on Day 36 (platelet 
count, 36 Gi/L). On Day 46, the subject was hospitalized with general deterioration, 
vomiting, and diarrhoea. Laboratory tests showed elevated bilirubin, direct bilirubin, serum 
creatinine, INR, and sodium. The event was not considered related to eltrombopag. 
•  One subject had a fatal hepatic neoplasm malignant and died more than one year after they 
had completed study treatment. The subject received open-label eltrombopag 25 mg daily 
for 15 days. The eltrombopag dose was increased to 50 mg/day on Day 16 (platelets 
29 Gi/L), 75 mg/day on Day 31 (platelets 46 Gi/L), and 100 mg/day on Day 42 (platelets 
42 Gi/L). The subject was withdrawn from open-label study treatment on Day 65 due to 
insufficient platelet response, and died on Day 626 (18 months post-therapy) due to HCC. 
In the two Phase III studies, 39 subjects (3%) with 57 fatal AEs died during the on-
treatment plus 6 months follow-up period: 29 (3%) in the eltrombopag group and 10 (2%) 
in the placebo group (see Table 44). Of these deaths, those that occurred within 30 days of 
treatment cessation numbered 19 in the eltrombopag group, and 4 in the placebo group.  
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 71/112 
 
 
  
  
Table 44. Fatal AEs On-Treatment Plus 6 Months Follow-Up During the DB Phase (Safety DB 
Population) 
Most of the subjects who died had baseline MELD scores ≥10 (22/29 subjects [76%] in the 
eltrombopag group and 8/10 subjects [80%] in the placebo group). Eleven deaths were 
considered by the investigator to be related to one of the investigational products (ie, either 
eltrombopag/placebo, or peginterferon/ribavirin), and all of these occurred in eltrombopag-
treated patients. Five of these deaths were attributed to antiviral therapy, five to all of the 
investigational products, and one to eltrombopag.  
This death  was classified as ‘sudden death’. The subject had a baseline MELD score of 10, HCV 
RNA >2 million IU/mL, and platelet count of 52 Gi/L. Concurrent medical conditions included 
hepatitis B, cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, and portal hypertension with oesophageal varices. The 
subject was found dead on Day 104 while on study treatment. In total, the patient received 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 72/112 
 
 
  
  
eltrombopag 25-50 mg/day for more than 79 days, and peginterferon 150 μg/week and ribavirin 
1200 mg/day for more than 57 days. The cause of death was unknown, though a diagnosis of 
lobar pneumonia was made on autopsy. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Based on non-clinical findings and clinical signals with eltrombopag and the mechanism of action 
of the drug, several categories of AEs of special interest were analysed further: thromboembolic, 
hepatobiliary, renal-related, malignancies, thrombocytopenia, bleeding and ocular. 
Thromboembolic Events 
Thromboembolic events reported during the study were identified using the “Embolic and 
Thrombotic Events” and “Myocardial Infarction” standard MedDRA query and preferred terms. No 
thromboembolic event occurred during the OL Phase of either of the Phase III studies. During the 
on-treatment plus 30 days follow-up period, 36 subjects experienced 39 confirmed or suspected 
events. There were 34 events in 31 eltrombopag subjects (3%) and 5 events in 5 placebo 
subjects (1%). Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was the most common event in both the 
eltrombopag treated group (1%) and the placebo group (<1%). Table 45 summarises the 
thromboembolic events observed during eltrombopag treatment. 
Table 45. Summary of Thromboembolic Events During On-Treatment Plus 30 Days Post-
Treatment (Safety DB Population) 
The subjects in the placebo group had a median platelet count of 44 Gi/L at the time of the 
event. In the eltrombopag group, the median platelet count was 108 Gi/L at the time of the 
event; no subject with a thromboembolic event had platelets above 200 Gi/L.

EMA/491212/2013 
Page 73/112 
 
 
 
 
  
  
A further 11 thromboembolic events occurred >30 days post-treatment (10 in eltrombopag 
subjects). Seven events involved the portal venous system, including 2 subjects who had 
previously experienced an event of the portal venous system on treatment.  
Upon CHMP request during the D120 List of Questions the MAH performed an additional 
assessment on the risk of TEE in ENABLE studies (separated and pooled). All cases were counted, 
avoiding the use of arbitrary limits (e.g. on-treatment plus 30 days). Cases of thromboembolic 
events were provided separately by trial, dose, duration, platelet counts, and risk factors. In 
addition, a comprehensive cumulative review of all cases of thromboembolisms including an 
analysis of time to onset, age, sex, dose, platelet counts, disease condition and severity (e.g HCV 
genotype, Child-Pugh classification, presence and/or stage of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis), prior 
antiviral medications, concomitant medications and outcome was also provided. 
Results of these analyses showed a total of 50 TEE cases in 44 subjects, 38 (4%) eltrombopag 
patients vs 6 (1.2%) placebo treated patients. The time adjusted incidence was 3.9/100 PY in 
eltrombopag vs 1.38/100 PY in placebo (pool data), with around 30% and 50% being SAE in 
eltrombopag and placebo, respectively. Approximately half of subjects had a portal VT (20/44), 
while 13/44 VE and 10/44 arterial thrombosis. Recovery was only accounted in 66% of cases. 
The data indicated that eltrombopag was associated with an increased risk for TEE in this 
particularly advanced liver disease population. In this regard, age ≥60 years and albumin <35g/L 
were significant risk factors for TEE in the ENABLE studies (see Table 46). The frequency of TEE 
was also higher in subjects with higher MELD scores (≥10), but one third of cases occurred in 
patients with MELD score <10. No specific temporal relationship between start of treatment and 
TEE was observed. No discernible pattern was observed involving gender or dose of eltrombopag.  
Table 46. TEE model: Adjusted OR and 95% CI and p-value for presented category compared to 
reference category among variables that were statistically significant in the stepwise regression. 
The majority of TEEs resolved and did not interfere with antiviral treatment (66%) but in 1/3 of 
cases not complete recovery could be reached (with 2 fatal cases, one in each treatment group). 
Hepatobiliary Events 
The analyses of hepatobiliary safety for the Safety DB Population are shown in Table 47:

Table 47. Hepatobiliary AEs On-Treatment Plus 30 Days Follow-Up in ≥1% Subjects in Either 
Treatment Group (Safety DB Population) 
With the exception of bilirubin abnormalities (largely due to increases in indirect bilirubin, which 
is generally considered benign) the distribution of all other combinations of laboratory 
abnormalities and the pattern of liver chemistry abnormalities were similar in the treatment 
groups, despite the longer observation period and the higher doses of antiviral therapy with 
interferon and ribavirin (see Table 48).

To evaluate hepatotoxic potential, the MAH presented a series of eDISH (evaluation of Drug-
Induced Serious Hepatotoxicity) plots showing the peak total bilirubin/ULN (upper limit of 
normal) against the peak ALT/ULN on-treatment during the DB Phase for both ENABLE studies 
(data not shown). This is based on the notion that a concomitant elevation in serum ALT and 
total bilirubin (Hy’s Law) is the most specific biomarker for potentially serious Drug-Induced Liver 
Injury. 
When ALT and bilirubin values were normalized for baseline, there were 17 subjects (11 
eltrombopag and 6 placebo) with substantial elevations in both ALT and bilirubin during the 
study. When subjects were analysed relative to their own baselines, 11 eltrombopag subjects 
and 6 placebo subjects were located in the right-hand quadrants, associated with liver injury. In 
this setting, definition of Hy’s Law cases is complicated by the fact that other causes for the 
increase in ALT and bilirubin exist, namely HCV infection and concomitant use of ribavirin and 
peginterferon. 
In addition the MAH provided upon CHMP request a review of all cases of liver injury including an 
analysis of time to onset, age, sex, dose, outcome, among others (data not shown). Events of 
liver injury (ALT or AST >3xULN) and severe liver injury (ALT or AST >3xULN and total Bilirubin 
>1.5x ULN with fractionated bilirubin ≥35%) were reported at a similar frequency in 
eltrombopag and placebo-treated patients. The age and gender distribution of those with liver 
injury was similar in the two treatment groups. A greater number of placebo-treated subjects 
with severe and non-severe liver injury discontinued treatment than those on eltrombopag with 
liver injury.  
Moreover a detailed presentation of the changes in hepatobiliary parameters during the DB 
phases of ENABLE 1 and 2 studies (on treatment plus 6 months follow-up) was provided. These 
data show that transaminases increments are similar between the treatment groups  with ALT or 
AST >3x ULN in 46% placebo vs 44% in eltrombopag.  
Potentially serious DILI (defined as increments in transaminases plus fractionated bilirrubin 
>35%) were more common on placebo compared to eltrombopag, suggesting that eltrombopag 
doesn’t cause hepatotoxicity in this patient population. However, hiperbilirrubinemia, associated 
with increments in transaminases, is a common AEs associated with the use of eltrombopog in 
this HCV population. 4(0.8%) cases of jaundice in placebo and 34(4%) in eltrombopag have 
been reported, of those experimented ALT or AST>3xULN 2 case in placebo and 16 in 
eltrombopag. Overall 2/484 (0.1%) in placebo and 16/955(1.6%) in eltrombopag had jaundice 
and transaminases increments. Changes in bilirubin (>2ULN) occurred in 55% of patients in 
eltrombopag vs 26% in placebo. In the majority of jaundice reported cases (23/38, 68%) 
patients recovered without sequelae. 
Hepatic decompensation 
AEs suggestive of hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal 
haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, HCC, death) were collected to identify patterns 
of events (see Table 49). A blinded independent review of these events was conducted by 
hepatology experts external to the MAH. The external adjudication panel assessment showed a 
6% higher proportion of subjects experienced an event suggestive of hepatic decompensation in 
the eltrombopag treatment group compared with the placebo group. 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 76/112 
 
  
  
Table 49. Events Suggestive of Hepatic Decompensation On-Treatment Plus 
30 Days Follow-Up During the DB Phase (External-Adjudication)  
Factors related to an increased probability of experiencing a hepatic decompensation event 
included baseline MELD score ≥10, non-Asian ancestry, and baseline albumin ≤35 g/L. 
There was no clear correlation between eltrombopag dose and hepatic decompensation events. 
The mean daily dose of eltrombopag was 65.6 mg in those experiencing an event, and 63.6 mg 
in those not. The cumulative eltrombopag dose was 9276 mg in those experiencing an event, 
and 14454 mg in those not (though around a third of those experiencing events had treatment 
withdrawn due to the event). The proportion who received the maximum dose (100 mg) of 
eltrombopag prior to an event was comparable in those experiencing an event (54%) and those 
not (53%). The distribution of eltrombopag doses taken (ie, proportions taking 12.5, 25, 50, 75 
and 100 mg doses) in those experiencing events and those not was also comparable. Similar 
results were observed for those randomised to placebo.  
Six percent of placebo subjects had an increase of 2 or more points in the Child-Pugh score from 
baseline to the end of follow-up, compared with 8% of eltrombopag subjects.  
Median MELD score increased during the open label phase, and in the double-blind phase for 
those treated with eltrombopag but not placebo (data not shown). Because MELD is dependent 
on serum bilirubin, which can be pharmacologically increased with concomitant eltrombopag and 
ribavirin, the MELD scores during the on-treatment period are difficult to interpret. 
Median interquartile range (INR) values in the eltrombopag treatment group were stable in the 
DB Phase and were similar to the median INR values for placebo-treated subjects, including at 
end-of-treatment and during follow-up. 
Renal-Related Adverse Events 
Renal-related adverse events that occurred on-treatment plus 30 days follow up is shown in 
Table 50: 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 77/112 
 
 
 
  
  
Table 50. Renal-Related AEs On-Treatment Plus 30 Days Follow- Up in ≥1% Subjects in Either 
Treatment Group (Safety DB Population) 
Two eltrombopag subjects who had a fatal AE of renal failure did so in the context of multi-organ 
failure.  
•  One subject died on Day 333, 17 days post-treatment, from generalized edema, 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal failure, hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
multiple organ failure (all Grade 4 SAEs). The subject’s baseline MELD score was 14. Medical 
conditions ongoing at study entry included hypertension, left atrial enlargement, left 
ventricular overload, esophageal varices, and depression. 
•  One subject died 3 weeks post –therapy (Day 186) due to sepsis with ensuing hepatic and 
renal failure. Subject’s baseline MELD score was 14. Medical conditions ongoing at study 
entry were reported as “aplastic anaemia”, glaucoma, and cirrhosis. 
Subjects with increases in serum creatinine of 44.3 μmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) and 26.6 μmol/L (0.3 
mg/dL) in ≥2 consecutive assessments were identified. More subjects treated with eltrombopag 
(16 subjects, 2%) had at least 2 consecutive assessments of creatinine ≥26.6 μmol/L above 
baseline compared with placebo (4 subjects, <1%). All other assessments were similar between 
both treatment groups. Similar proportions of subjects in both treatment groups (eltrombopag, 
8%; placebo, 6%) had decreases in creatinine clearance (to 60-89 mL/min) at ≥ 2 consecutive 
visits (data not shown). 
The occurrences of hypokalemia, hyponatremia or hypomagnesemia were investigated and 
compared between the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups. Two subjects in the 
eltrombopag group (<1%) and no subjects in the placebo group had a Grade3/Grade4 
hypokalemia. Eight subjects in the eltrombopag group (<1%) had a Grade3/Grade4 
hyponatremia compared with none in the placebo group. Similar proportions of subjects in both 
treatment groups experienced a shift from baseline to a toxicity Grade ≥ 2 for magnesium 
(eltrombopag: 4%; placebo: 4%). 
Malignancies 
Malignancies were reported by 66 subjects during the DB Phase (see Table 51). 
Table 51. Malignancy adverse events during DB phase (safety DB population)  
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 78/112 
 
 
 
  
  
During double blind phase, 81 subjects, 55( 6%) eltrombopag and 26 (5%) in placebo reported 
“hepatic lesions”, most of them were “confirmed or suspected” hepatocelullar carcinoma HCC”, 
44 (5%) in eltrombopag and 19 (4%) in placebo. In addition four subjects had a report of 
hepatic neoplasm during open-label phase. Development of hepatocelullar carcinoma is not 
unexpected in patients with advance HCV disease. No relevant differences between treatment 
arms have been found. 
The MAH also reported two patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, none of 
them related with eltrombopag therapy. 
Thrombocytopenia Adverse Events 
During the DB Phase on-treatment plus 30 days follow-up period, the proportion of subjects 
reporting a thrombocytopenic event was lower in the eltrombopag group (17%) compared with 
the placebo group (40%).  
Bleeding Adverse Events 
The following section is focused on non-variceal bleeding events. Variceal (oesophageal and/or 
gastric) bleeding events are considered a consequence of hepatic decompensation and are 
discussed in more detail above. 
During the DB Phase On-treatment plus 30 days follow-up, the proportion of subjects reporting a 
non-variceal bleeding event was lower in the eltrombopag treatment group (16%) compared with 
the placebo group (21%) (see Table 52). 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 79/112 
 
 
  
  
Table 52. Adjudicated Non-Variceal Bleeding Events On-Treatment Plus 30 
Days Follow-Up in ≥1% Subjects in Either Treatment Group (Safety DB Population) 
Seven subjects in the ENABLE studies (1 placebo, 6 eltrombopag) had a bleeding event that 
preceded a fatal event. The placebo event was due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The 
eltrombopag events include a haemorrhagic stroke, and 5 cases of GI haemorrhage.  
In addition upon CHMP request during the D120 List of Outstanding issues the MAH has provided 
details about the post-therapy platelet counts and bleeding episodes during the follow up phase. 
In general a lower proportion of subjects in the eltrombopag group (50%) had post-therapy 
platelet  count less than baseline compared to the placebo group (73%). Moreover after 
withdrawal of eltrombopag, platelet counts gradually return to baseline values over a 24 week 
follow-up period, which is reassuring. 
With regard to bleeding events, 48 (5%) patients in eltrombopag and 22(5%) in placebo 
experimented bleeding events, with higher numbers in the eltrombopag arm experiencing serious 
(27% vs 38% in placebo/eltrombopag, respectively), G3/4 bleedings (18% vs 35%, respectively) 
and fatal (4 subjects, 8% of cases in eltrombopag) bleedings. When the data are analysed by the 
type, either non-GI vs GI bleedings, it appears that these differences are mainly driven by the GI 
bleedings (19 subjects (2%) reported 22 events in eltrombopag arm vs 7 subjects (1%), 8 
events in placebo arm) for which more cases/serious and fatal cases are reported in the 
eltrombopag treatment arm. 
Ocular Events 
Cataracts were first observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in mice and rats, but not in 
dogs. Subjects were actively monitored and detailed ocular assessments (including assessments 
for cataracts) were therefore added at screening or baseline, every 12 weeks, end-of-treatment, 
and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits. Cataract events were categorised as progression of 
existing cataracts and development of new cataracts. Results are shown in Table 53. 
Table 53. CEC Adjudicated Cataract Events During DB Phase 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 80/112 
 
 
 
  
  
Comparative incidences by exposure time were provided by the MAH upon CHMP request during 
the D120 List of Questions. The rates of development of new cataract and the progression of pre-
existing cataract in subjects treated with eltrombopag were double those of placebo-treated 
subjects. Baseline risk factors for cataract were generally comparable in the groups. However, 
33% of the placebo subjects with a cataract event had a history of diabetes, compared with 20% 
of the eltrombopag subjects. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for cataract, and the imbalance 
of this confounding factor may suggest a larger effect of eltrombopag on cataract risk than 
observed from the results observed in the ENABLE studies. 
In addition four cases of cataract have been reported in the post-marketing data for eltrombopag 
in ITP. Assessment of causality was, however, confounded by the use of steroids in these 
patients.  
Laboratory findings 
Overall, abnormalities in the haematology parameters were balanced between treatment groups 
with the exception of Grade 4 lymphopenia, which occurred more frequently with eltrombopag 
(25%) than placebo (13%). 
Clinical chemistry parameters examined during the study included calcium, glucose, potassium, 
and sodium. No systematic differences or patterns were observed between the treatment groups. 
Each subject’s vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) and 
weight were measured throughout the DB Phase. There were no consistent patterns of change in 
vital signs during the DB Phase. Subjects in both arms had a mean decrease in weight during the 
studies, with those in the eltrombopag arm consistently experiencing slightly greater weight loss 
(mean change from baseline at end of treatment -2.7 kg placebo, -4.4 eltrombopag). This weight 
difference between the arms became less evident during the post-treatment follow-up. 
The proportions of ECG findings (normal, abnormal – not clinically significant, abnormal – 
clinically significant) at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at the 24 week follow-up were 
similar in the two treatment groups, with most ECGs listed as normal or abnormal, not clinically 
significant. However, a greater proportion of eltrombopag subjects were considered to have a 
clinically significant change from baseline compared with placebo subjects (12 vs. 2).  
With regard to the worst ECG finding during the study, the proportions with a clinically significant 
change from baseline were 2% (8 subjects) for placebo, and 5% (43 subjects) for eltrombopag. 
Of the 8 placebo subjects, there were 2 corresponding AEs, both involving ST segment 
abnormalities. Of the 43 eltrombopag subjects, there were 26 corresponding AEs:

1 acute myocardial infarction (ST elevated) 
The proportions of subjects who had an increased QTcF from the screening assessment to the 
antiviral baseline assessment or end-of-treatment/withdrawal were similar between the 
eltrombopag group and the placebo group (see Table 54). A greater proportion of eltrombopag 
subjects had a worst case increase in QTcF of 31-60 msec compared with the placebo group. 
Table 54. QTcF (msec) Increases During DB Phase (Safety DB Population) 
The MAH provided a mixed effects modelling analysis to study the relationship between 
eltrombopag concentration and cardiac repolarization in patients with HCV (data not shown). A 
total of 98 subjects with time-matched electrocardiogram (ECG) and serial pharmacokinetics (PK) 
data were included in the analysis (analysis population). The analysis concluded that 
eltrombopag is predicted to have no clinically significant effect on QTc intervals at either 
therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses in subjects with HCV infection. 
Safety in special populations 
The pooled safety analyses were evaluated for the impact of intrinsic factors on AE incidence. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the on-treatment plus 30 days post-treatment follow-up 
period for subjects in the Safety DB Population for

HCV Genotype 
Subjects in the two HCV genotype subgroups were treated differently. The HCV genotype non-
2/3 subgroup had a longer median cumulative duration of treatment for all 3 IPs than the 
genotype 2/3 subgroup. In the HCV genotype non-2/3 subgroup, the safety profile was similar to 
that for the overall safety. In the HCV genotype 2/3 subgroup, the safety profile was similar 
between the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups. 
Subjects with HCV genotype non-2/3 had a higher frequency of AEs, including death, than 
subjects with HCV genotype 2/3. There were 17 eltrombopag subjects (3%) with a fatal event in 
the HCV genotype non-2/3 group, compared with 6 subjects (2%) in the HCV genotype 2/3 
group. Table 55 shows Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs by HCV Genotype.

MELD Score 
The median cumulative duration of treatment for DB study drug, peginterferon and ribavirin were 
all longer for the eltrombopag treatment group compared with the placebo group for both MELD 
subgroups. However, this difference between the treatment groups was greater in the MELD ≥10 
(~35% difference) subgroup for each of the 3 IPs compared to MELD <10 (~9% difference). This 
difference was primarily due to the shorter median cumulative duration of treatment for the 
MELD ≥10 placebo group compared to the MELD <10 placebo group.  
Subjects with a baseline MELD score ≥10 had a higher frequency of AEs, including death, than 
subjects with a baseline MELD score <10. There were 6 eltrombopag subjects (1%) with a fatal 
event in the MELD <10 group, compared with 16 subjects (4%) in the MELD ≥ 10 group. For the

Albumin 
Subjects with baseline albumin ≤35 g/L had a higher frequency of AEs, including death, than 
subjects with baseline albumin >35 g/L. There were 15 eltrombopag subjects (5%) with a fatal 
event in the albumin ≤35 g/L, compared with 8 subjects (1%) in the albumin >35 g/L. For the 
baseline albumin >35 g/L subgroup, the safety profile was similar between the placebo and 
eltrombopag treatment groups  
Subjects with baseline albumin ≤35 g/L treated with eltrombopag had a higher incidence of AEs 
suggestive of hepatic decompensation (25%) compared with subjects with baseline albumin >35 
g/L treated with eltrombopag (8%), and higher than the corresponding placebo group (10%) 
(see Table 58 and 59).

Population) 
Overall Summary of Adverse Events by Baseline MELD Score and Baseline Albumin 
In the ENABLE studies baseline MELD ≥10 was associated with a 3-fold higher rate of progression 
to decompensated liver disease in comparison to baseline MELD <10. This was observed in both 
the  placebo  and  the  eltrombopag  treatment  groups.  Subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  with  a 
baseline  MELD  score  ≥10  had  a  higher  frequency  of  adverse  events,  including  death,  than 
subjects  with  a  baseline  MELD  score  <10  (see  Table  60).  In  contrast,  the  safety  profile  was 
similar  between  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag  treatment  groups  for  the  baseline  MELD  <10 
subgroup. Subjects in both treatment groups with baseline albumin levels <35 g/L had a higher 
frequency of AEs suggestive of hepatic decompensation, including death. Similar to subjects with 
baseline  MELD  score  <10,  the  safety  profile  was  similar  between  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag 
treatment groups for subjects with albumin levels >35 g/L.

Treatment Plus 30 Days Follow-up (Pooled Data, Safety DB Population)

The safety profile was similar for patients treated with eltrombopag and placebo for subjects with 
genotype 2/3, MELD <10, or albumin levels >35 g/L, whilst the SVR rates were higher in the 
subjects in these subgroups. 
Fibrosis Score 
FibroSURE category F0/F1/F2 had a lower incidence and occurrence of AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, drug 
related AEs and AEs leading to IP discontinuation when compared with category F3/F4 and the 
overall safety DB population, although this subgroup (F0/F1/F2) had a small number of subjects. 
Age 
Although the proportion of patients aged at least 65 years was small, they appeared to 
experience a disproportionate number of adverse events of special interest (other than those 
suggestive of hepatic decompensation) (see Table 61). In particular, non-variceal bleeding 
events and cataract events occurred at a higher frequency in older subjects.

Overall, the AE profile was generally similar for the eltrombopag group compared with the 
placebo group for both genders. 
Race 
Population PK analysis have shown that Eastern Asians (such as Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese 
and Korean) have a higher plasma eltrombopag AUC value than non East Asians. The small 
number of subjects in the Eastern Asian (10%) and Other Asian (13%) categories, however, 
make it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding differences between the 
subgroups. 
Eastern Asians received slightly lower cumulative doses of eltrombopag and antivirals than 
Whites, but over a longer duration than other racial groups.  
Adjudicated events of special interest were analysed by the three racial groups (see Table 62). 
The AE profile was similar with that observed for the overall Safety DB Population, though events 
in East Asians were more common than in other racial groups.  
Table 62. Adverse Events of Special Interest by Race 
BMI 
Overall, the adverse event profile was generally similar for the eltrombopag group compared with 
the placebo group for both BMI categories. The exception was the incidence of SAEs, which was 
higher in the eltrombopag group compared with the placebo group for the BMI <30 category 
(20% vs. 13%). There was a higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group compared with 
the eltrombopag group with AE leading to IP discontinuation for both BMI categories. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential for interaction of eltrombopag with the organic anion transporter polypeptide, 
OATP1B1, the breast cancer resistance protein, polyvalent cations, and high-fat foods is already 
detailed in the SmPC. Post-marketing reports have not highlighted any additional concerns 
regarding interactions.  
Upon CHMP request the MAH provided preliminary findings of a DDI study to investigate the 
potential for an interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors telaprevir and 
boceprevir. The study involved 56 healthy volunteers; high single doses of eltrombopag were 
used (200 mg), with maximum recommended single and multiple dose levels of the protease 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

inhibitors. The study design, with steady-state dosing of the protease inhibitors, was designed to 
document the effect of protease inhibitors on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics. Preliminary results 
show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag however the full study 
report is awaited before any conclusion can be made. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A greater proportion of placebo subjects (29%) discontinued investigational product due to an AE 
compared with eltrombopag treated subjects (22%) as shown in Table 63. This difference was 
mainly attributed to events of thrombocytopenia. Hematological toxicities were the most 
common reasons for discontinuation in both treatment groups.

Post marketing experience 
Eltrombopag was first approved for marketing in the US on 20 November 2008 for the treatment 
of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura 
(ITP). As of 31 March 2012, there were 2261 spontaneous and post marketing cases (5215 AEs) 
received for marketed use of eltrombopag, received from 41 countries (the majority from the 
US) (see Table 64).  
Table 64. Ten Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events from Spontaneous and Post-Marketing 
Surveillance Cases 
There were 489 cases with a fatal outcome out of the 2261 cases reported from marketed usage 
of eltrombopag. These cases have been presented in detail in periodic safety update reports. 
Many reports with fatal outcome primarily described elderly patients with multiple underlying 
medical conditions and co-morbidities that likely contributed to the fatal outcome. The majority 
of the cases with a fatal outcome were from the post marketing studies (402/489). There was a 
wide age range reported (3-100 years), with the majority of reported cases describing patients 
greater than 65 years of age. The cause of death was unknown or unspecified in over 30% of the 
cases received by GSK. The remaining causes of death pertained to primarily elderly patients 
with underlying malignancies, infections including sepsis, cardiac disorders, renal disease, 
respiratory conditions, and nervous system disorders. 
The most frequently reported hepatobiliary events were liver function test abnormal (47), liver 
disorder (37), aspartate aminotransferase increased (29), alanine aminotransferase increased 
(27), hepatic enzyme increased (27), hepatic function abnormal (18), and blood bilirubin 
increased (15). The outcomes of the 206 cases were improved/resolved (80), unresolved (22), 
fatal (40), and unknown (64). In general, most cases describe mild and transient elevations in 
liver function parameters, which resolved or improved following eltrombopag discontinuation or 
dose reduction. Some cases were of severe liver injury or liver failure in the setting of other co-
morbid conditions such as sepsis leading to multi-organ failure, or worsening liver function in 
patients with pre-existing liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis). 
There were 210 cases reviewed that pertained to thromboembolic events. The most frequently 
reported events in these 210 cases were deep vein thrombosis (58), pulmonary embolism (48), 
myocardial infarction (22), thrombosis (20), cerebrovascular accident (15), acute myocardial 
infarction (9), and portal vein thrombosis (9). The outcomes of the 210 cases were

improved/resolved (81), resolved with sequelae (3), unresolved (24), worse (1), fatal (34), and 
unknown (67). The patients with a fatal thromboembolic event had multiple co morbidities 
including congestive heart failure, leukemia, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, 
carotid arterial stenosis, and hyperlipidemia. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for eltrombopag in combination with interferon-based antiviral therapy in 
chronic HCV comprises placebo-controlled data for 955 patients from up to 6 months of dosing in 
two double-blind trials, preceded by an initial uncontrolled dosing period. Supportive data are 
also available from the small dose-ranging Phase II study. Eltrombopag has been licensed for use 
in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura for over 2 years. It is known to be associated with 
a risk of hepatotoxicity (increases in serum transaminases and bilirubin) and 
thrombotic/thromboembolic events. Eltrombopag has been also associated with cataract in 
rodent studies. 
In the ENABLE studies there were significantly more AEs, including SAEs, fatal AEs, drug-related 
AEs, AEs leading to study withdrawal, and AEs leading to study medication discontinuation, in 
those treated with eltrombopag as compared to placebo. The commonest SAEs and causes of 
death were related to hepatic decompensation. The incidence of SAEs related to hepatic 
decompensation in eltrombopag subjects was double that in placebo subjects (8% vs. 4%). 
There were 30 fatal events related to hepatic decompensation: 7 in the placebo group (1.4%) 
and 23 in the eltrombopag group (2.4%). There were also 5 cases of fatal GI haemorrhage, all 
occurring in those on eltrombopag. 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic events were more common in those on eltrombopag. Upon CHMP 
request the MAH provided a very detailed discussion on the TEE cases observed during the 
ENABLE 1 and 2 studies showing that 38 out of 955 subjects (4 %) treated with eltrombopag and 
6 out of 484 subjects (1 %) in the placebo group experienced TEEs. Reported 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications included both venous and arterial events. The majority 
of TEEs were non-serious and resolved by the end of the study. Portal vein thrombosis was the 
most common TEE in both treatment groups (2 % in patients treated with eltrombopag versus 
< 1 % for placebo). In addition significant risk factors for TEEs included age ≥ 60 and albumin 
< 3.5 g/L. This information has been included in the SmPC. 
No cases of elevated platelet levels occurred in patients with maximum platelets counts < 100 
Gi/L and the majority of cases occurred in patients >150 Gi/L (26/44) elevated platelet. 
Furthermore, median platelet levels near to the event tended to be higher in the eltrombopag 
treatment arms compared to placebo (93 Gi/L vs 50 Gi/L). Although low platelet levels do not 
prevent from TEE, there seems to be a higher risk in patients with higher platelet levels during 
the course of treatment. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the recommended posology should 
keep platelets values <150 Gi/L and treatment with eltrombopag should be stopped when 
platelet values >150 Gi/L to minimise the risk for TEE. In addition, an additional statement has 
been included in section 4.2 of the SmpC highlighting the need to use the lowest dose of 
eltrombopag to achieve and maintain a platelet count ≥50 Gi/L. 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 91/112 
 
 
  
  
Hepatobiliary events were also more common in those treated with eltrombopag. This was partly 
due to an increase in events of hyperbilirubinaemia; eltrombopag is known to inhibit a 
metabolising enzyme of bilirubin, resulting in elevation of unconjugated bilirubin. Although 
increases in serum transaminases were comparable to the placebo group, events suggestive of 
hepatic decompensation (such as ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatic encephalopathy) 
occurred nearly twice as frequently in those on eltrombopag (OR 1.9, CI 1.3 to 2.9). This did not 
appear to be a dose-dependent finding, and is further complicated by the fact that those treated 
with eltrombopag were exposed to higher doses of peginterferon/ribavirin. However, the 
association between peginterferon/ribavirin therapy and hepatotoxicity is not strong. Therefore, 
the CHMP agreed that a statement regarding hepatic decompensation should be added to the 
eltrombopag SmPC to adequately address the risk. In addition the SmPC has been updated to 
provide appropriate information to warn physicians on the risk of transaminases increments and 
hyperbillirubinemia in relation to eltrombopag. 
The numerical trend for more serious bleeding GI events after stopping therapy is a matter of 
concern and has been reflected adequately in the SmPC. Additional follow up of this risk at post-
approval has also been included in the RMP. 
The rates of development of new cataract and the progression of pre-existing cataract in subjects 
treated with eltrombopag were higher than those of placebo-treated subjects (8 % of the 
eltrombopag group and 5 % of the placebo group). Baseline risk factors for cataract were 
generally comparable in the groups. However, 33% of the placebo subjects with a cataract event 
had a history of diabetes, compared with 20% of the eltrombopag subjects. Diabetes is a 
significant risk factor for cataract, and the imbalance of this confounding factor may suggest a 
larger effect of eltrombopag on cataract risk than observed from the results observed in the 
ENABLE studies. 
Nevertheless, cataract has been included as an ‘important identified risk’ in the RMP, since it has 
been demonstrated in non-clinical studies and confirmed by clinical data, and the magnitude of 
difference in occurrence between the eltrombopag and placebo groups is of sufficient magnitude, 
with no other convincing explanation, to suggest a causal relationship. Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
has been amended to add the rates of cataract events in the eltrombopag and placebo groups 
and the recommendation to monitor for cataract. The risk is adequately detailed in the SmPC and 
patient information leaflet. 
A PK modelling analysis of subjects in the ENABLE studies to examine the relationship between 
plasma eltrombopag concentration and change in QTc interval from baseline revealed a low risk 
of QTc prolongation at maximum and supratherapeutic doses of eltrombopag. However, neither 
non-clinical studies nor the clinical thorough QT-Study conducted to assess the potential effect 
on eltrombopag on QT demonstrated any effect of concern. During the DB phase clinically 
significant changes from baseline in ECG were seen in 1% (12) patients in eltrombopag vs <1% 
(2 cases) in placebo. Further, differences in the incidence of ECG related AEs during this D-B 
phase were also found, with again small differences between treatments (a total 3% in placebo 
vs 4% in eltrombopag). In addition, when considering only those cases of AE related to 
QT/repolarisation abnormalities, there were no cases in placebo vs 13 in eltrombopag treated 
patients.

While the specific studies to detect QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic effect 
concluded “no effect”, the results obtained from ENABLEs studies appears to contradict that 
conclusion and section 4.8 of the SmpC includes “electrocardiogram QT prolonged “ as a common 
adverse reaction”. Given this discrepancies and the fact that this is a particularly susceptible 
population, the CHMP was of the opinion that this risk had to be included in the RMP as a safety 
concern and will be followed up by routine pharmacovigilance activities. The SmPC has been also 
been updated to better reflect this risk. 
Patients with MELD score ≥10 and those with baseline albumin levels ≤ 35 g/L are at an 
increased risk of a SAE and fatal events. This is not unexpected and it is supported by the data 
provided, which indicates that patients with a more advance disease are at particular risk for 
AEs. Eltrombopag should only be administered to such patients after careful consideration of 
the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. Patients should be closely monitored for 
signs and symptoms of TEE (see Benedfit-risk balance and  SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Other baseline factors, such as age, gender, BMI, and race, did not appear to have a significant 
effect on the safety findings. 
Relevant risks to the HCV-associated thrombocytopenia, in particular thromboembolic events, 
hepatic decompensation and fatal adverse events, will be addressed in the already existing 
healthcare professional information pack containing educational materials to be provided prior 
to launch to all physicians who intend to prescribe eltrombopag. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that it was necessary to further characterize known safety 
concerns (e.g. thromboembolisms, hepatic decompensation) including possible risks factors, 
and to generate efficacy/safety data on populations with important missing information (e.g. 
safety and efficacy of eltrombopag with new acting agents). The effects of eltrombopag on 
liver-related outcome (including mortality) should be studied. Until these data is available, the 
CHMP was of the opinion that the safety and efficacy have not been established in combination 
with direct acting antiviral agents approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC includes an adequate warning informing of this fact. 
The MAH agreed to further explore the safety and efficacy of using eltrombopag including 
combination with direct acting antiviral agents (triple therapy) in three post-authorisation safety 
studies (PASS). Two of the studies will be nested within existing multicentre, prospective 
observational cohort HCV Research UK and Hepatitis C Therapeutic Registry and Research 
Network (HCVTARGET), and the third one will be conducted by GSK.  
Safety outcomes in all three post-authorization studies will include: 
• Hepatic decompensation 
• Myocardial infarction 
• Ischemic Stroke 
• Portal vein thrombosis 
• Deep vein thrombosis 
• Pulmonary embolism 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report

Page 93/112 
 
  
  
• All cause mortality 
• Cause-specific mortality from the death certificate 
• Other long term outcomes, to be identified during protocol development 
The studies will include the following effectiveness outcomes: 
• Initiated interferon-based antiviral therapy 
• Maintained interferon-based antiviral therapy 
• Reached sustained virologic response or early virologic response 
• Other long term outcomes, to be identified during protocol development 
In addition, the CHMP was of the opinion that additional pharmacovigilance activities were 
necessary in order to characterise the off-label use of eltrombopag. To address this concern the 
MAH will perform a Drug Utilization Study (DUS) post-marketing. 
Moreover, the CHMP agreed on the need to provide data on the effectiveness of the risk 
minimization measures, therefore the MAH was requested to conduct post-authorisation a study 
to measure the effectiveness of the educational material. 
All requested studies have been included in the RMP and are listed in the approved 
pharmacovigilance plan as category 3 (required additional pharmacovigilance activity). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The use of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic HCV patients in the ENABLE studies was associated 
with a range of adverse events, but in particular an increase in fatal AEs, and an increased risk of 
thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal 
haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). In subjects with poor prognostic factors (MELD 
score ≥10 or albumin <3.5 g/dL) the risks were particularly high. 
In summary, treatment with eltrombopag offers patients with end-stage HCV, and an otherwise 
poor prognosis, an opportunity to undergo antiviral therapy, increasing their chances of 
achieving SVR by half. The risks are not insignificant, but several may be associated with 
concomitant antiviral therapy, and may be treatable. Patients with the poorest prognosis face 
the highest risk, but this group of patients represents those most at need of successful antiviral 
therapy.

between the elderly and younger patients, but 
greater sensitivity of some older individuals 
cannot be ruled out. 
There are limited data on the use of 
eltrombopag in HCV patients aged 
over 75 years. Caution should be exercised in 
these patients. 
The SmPC (Section 4.2 Posology) states the 
following: 
Hepatic impairment 
Eltrombopag should not be used in ITP 
patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score ≥ 5) unless the expected benefit 
outweighs the identified risk of portal venous 
thrombosis. 
If the use of eltrombopag is deemed 
necessary for ITP patients with hepatic 
impairment the starting dose must be 25 mg 
once daily. After initiating the dose of 
eltrombopag in patients with hepatic 
impairment wait 3 weeks before increasing 
the dose. 
No dose adjustment is required for 
thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV 
and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score ≤ 6). Thrombocytopenic patients with 
chronic HCV should initiate eltrombopag at a 
dose of 25 mg once daily. After initiating the 
dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic 
impairment wait 2 weeks before increasing 
the dose. 
There is an increased risk for adverse events, 
including thromboembolic events, in 
thrombocytopenic patients with advanced 
chronic liver disease treated with 
eltrombopag, either in preparation for 
invasive procedures or in HCV patients 
undergoing antiviral therapy.  
The SmPC (Section 4.2 Posology) states the 
following: 
Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is 
necessary in patients with renal impairment. 
Patients with impaired renal function should 
use eltrombopag with caution and close 
monitoring, for example by testing serum

The SmPC (Section 4.1) states the following: 
Revolade is indicated for adult chronic 
immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic 
purpura (ITP) splenectomised patients who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Revolade 
may be considered as second line treatment 
for adult non-splenectomised patients where 
surgery is contraindicated. 
Revolade is indicated in adult patients with 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for 
the treatment of thrombocytopenia, where the 
degree of thrombocytopenia prevents the 
initiation or limits the ability to maintain 
optimal interferon-based therapy (see 
section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
Revolade is not recommended for use in 
children and adolescents below age 18 due 
to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted 
by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use. 
The applicant requested to have a combined package leaflet for the 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg 
strengths. This was considered acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The clinical program for eltrombopag was designed to investigate the proportion of 
thrombocytopenic patients with HCV who could reach a platelet count sufficient to enable 
initiation of interferon therapy, and then to randomise patients to receive either ongoing 
treatment with eltrombopag or placebo and to measure the proportion achieving SVR. This 
endpoint was relevant because the success of interferon/ribavirin therapy may be compromised 
by thrombocytopenia, in terms of treatment interruptions or dose reductions. 
In the ENABLE studies approximately 95% of thrombocytopenic patients achieved the threshold 
platelet count and were able to start antiviral therapy, mostly within 4 weeks. In the subsequent 
placebo-controlled phase, the proportion of those treated with eltrombopag achieving SVR was 
23% in ENABLE 1 and 19% in ENABLE 2, representing a difference to placebo of 8% and 6%, 
respectively. This represents a relative increase in response of around 50% in a group of patients 
who may otherwise be ineligible for antiviral therapy, or who, if treated, may respond poorly. 
The other secondary endpoints were supportive of the efficacy of eltrombopag. In the double-
blind treatment phase the rate of antiviral dose reductions in those on eltrombopag was 40% 
that of placebo-treated subjects. Correspondingly, the average time to requirement for a dose 
reduction was slightly prolonged in those on eltrombopag, and fewer patients required premature 
discontinuation of antiviral therapy. Adherence to antiviral therapy was higher in eltrombopag-
treated subjects, and was shown to be related to a higher probability of achieving SVR.  
During antiviral therapy, those on eltrombopag maintained consistently higher platelet counts 
than those on placebo, and remained at levels above 50 Gi/L for considerably longer periods.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The relevance of the study results was questioned given that current clinical practice involves the 
new treatment options available, including DAA+pegIFN +Ribavirin. The CHMP agreed that the 
results remain relevant as long as interferon is the backbone of HCV antiviral therapy and 
preliminary PK results from a drug-drug interaction study to investigate the potential for 
interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir have been 
presented to support its use in association with HCV triple therapy including direct acting antiviral 
agents. Preliminary results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag. 
Further data will be submitted to further address this issue (see benefit-risk balance). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The use of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic HCV patients in the ENABLE studies was associated 
with a range of adverse events, but in particular an increase in fatal AEs, and an increased risk of 
thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal 
haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). In subjects with poor prognostic factors (MELD 
score ≥10 or albumin <3.5 g/dL) the risks were particularly high. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Nowadays the standard of care for HVC patients is triple therapy with new direct antivirals. There 
is no comprehensive data on the safety profile of eltrombopag added to a triple combination 
regimen of antivirals. To date only preliminary PK results from a drug-drug interaction study to 
investigate the potential for interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors 
boceprevir and telaprevir have been presented to support its use in association with HCV triple 
therapy including direct acting antiviral agents. Full results are not yet available and are awaited 
but preliminary results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag. 
Further data will be submitted to further address this issue (see benefit-risk balance) 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Treatment with eltrombopag offers patients with end-stage HCV, and an otherwise poor 
prognosis, an opportunity to undergo antiviral therapy, increasing their chances of achieving SVR 
by half. SVR not only represents cure from viral infection, but also provides the prospect of 
changing the natural history of the disease. 
The use of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic HCV patients in the ENABLE studies was associated 
with a range of adverse events, including an increased risk of thrombotic events and hepatic 
decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis).

EMA/491212/2013 
Page 106/112 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Benefit-risk balance 
In view of the benefits in terms of SVR that is likely to represent cure from infection, the toxicity 
was considered acceptable and the benefit-risk balance was considered positive in the following 
revised indication: 
Revolade is indicated in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor 
preventing the initiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy. 
The benefit in terms of SVR was slightly lower in patients with MELD score ≥10 and those with 
baseline albumin levels ≤ 35 g/L who are at an increased risk of a SAE and fatal events. This is 
not unexpected and it is supported by the data provided, which indicates that patients with a 
more advance disease are at particular risk for AEs. Eltrombopag should only be administered 
to such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the 
risks. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of TEE (see Benefit-risk 
balance and SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Although the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag have not been established in combination with 
direct acting antiviral agents approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection, based on 
the available pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data, a restriction of the indication to 
exclude use in combination with direct acting antiviral agents does not seem appropriate as 
important differences in terms of safety and efficacy are unlikely. The need for additional efficacy 
and safety data is reflected in the SmPC and will be addressed in a post-authorisation safety 
study. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In the ENABLE studies approximately 95% of thrombocytopenic patients achieved the threshold 
platelet count and were able to start antiviral therapy, mostly within 4 weeks. In the subsequent 
placebo-controlled phase, the proportion of those treated with eltrombopag achieving SVR was 
23% in ENABLE 1 and 19% in ENABLE 2, representing a difference to placebo of 8 and 6 
percentage points, respectively. This represents a relative increase in response of around 50% in 
a group of patients who may otherwise be ineligible for antiviral therapy, or who, if treated, may 
respond poorly. 
The risks are not insignificant, in particular an increased risk of thrombotic events and hepatic 
decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis) and an increased risk of fatal AEs. In subjects with poor prognostic factors (MELD 
score ≥10 or albumin <3.5 g/dL) the risks were particularly high, however this group of patients 
represents those most at need of successful antiviral therapy. 
Although several AEs may be associated with concomitant antiviral therapy, and may be 
treatable, the CHMP considered necessary to revise the wording of the indication initially 
proposed by the MAH to reflect that only patients who otherwise could not initiate or maintain an 
IFN-based HCV regimen should be candidates to this treatment.

Thromboembolic events 
ITP patients 
•  
•  
• 
•  
•  
•  
Eltrombopag should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 
≥ 5) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis. 
If use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary, the starting dose must be 25mg once daily. 
Educate patients about the potential for thromboembolic events (TEE) in patients with 
chronic ITP and those known risk factors for thromboembolic events (e.g., Factor V Leiden, 
ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome). 
 Educate patients about chronic liver disease and the risk of thromboembolic events. 
In patients with chronic liver disease treated with eltrombopag there was an association 
between TEE and platelet counts ≥ 200,000µl. 
A dose reduction is recommended for ITP patients with platelet counts between 150,000-
250,000/μl. 
Revolade should be interrupted if platelet counts increase to > 250,000/μl. Once the 
platelet count is < 100,000/μl, reinitiate therapy at a reduced daily dose. 
HCV patients 
• 
• 
• 
Thrombocytopenic patients with HCV should initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once 
daily. 
Educate thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV about the risk of thromboembolic 
events, particularly the increased incidence of portal vein thrombosis and known risk factors 
for thromboembolic events (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid 
syndrome). 
In thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV there was no specific temporal relationship 
between start of treatment and event of TEE. TEEs were more common in patients 
> 60 years old and in patients with albumin below 35 g/L. 
•  A dose reduction is recommended for thrombocytopenic chronic HCV patients with platelet 
counts between 100,000-150,000/μl. 
•  Revolade should be interrupted if platelet counts increase to > 150,000/μl. Once the platelet 
count is < 100,000/µl, reinitiate therapy at a reduced daily dose. 
Posology 
•  
•  
Educate patients on the appropriate administration of Revolade (e.g. titration of Revolade, 
food-drug interaction, dose recommendations for special populations [e.g. East Asians]). 
Awareness to prescribers of the labelled indication and warnings associated with non-
indicated populations (e.g. not recommended for use in children, pregnant or breast-
feeding women, other off label uses). 
Food Interactions 
•  
•  
Educate patients about the potential food-drug interaction (i.e. chelation with polyvalent 
cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc). Antacids, dairy 
products and other products containing polyvalent cations, such as mineral supplements, 
must be administered at least four hours apart from Revolade dosing to avoid significant 
reduction in Revolade absorption due to chelation. 
Assist patient in developing a plan to administer Revolade at a time each day that fits into 
the patient’s own daily schedule. 
Reoccurrence of Thrombocytopenia 
•  
Educate patients about the potential risk of bleeding after treatment has stopped (include 
incidence in clinical trials and likelihood of reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia after 
cessation of treatment). 
CHMP group of an extension of Marketing Authorisation and variations assessment report  
EMA/491212/2013 
Page 110/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
•  
•  
Following discontinuation of Revolade, platelet counts return to baseline levels within 2 
weeks in the majority of patients, which increase the bleeding risk and in some cases may 
lead to bleeding. 
Monitor platelet count weekly for 4 weeks following discontinuation of Revolade. 
Increased Bone Marrow Reticulin Fibres 
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Educate patients about the potential for bone marrow reticulin fibre formation. 
Background information on reticulin in the bone marrow (i.e. background rates of reticulin 
in bone marrow in ITP patients and the observed incidence and potential mechanism of 
action of reticulin deposition in response to Revolade). 
Prior to initiation of Revolade, examine the peripheral blood smear closely to establish a 
baseline level of cellular morphologic abnormalities. 
Following identification of a stable dose of Revolade, perform complete blood count (CBC) 
with white blood cell count (WBC) differential monthly. 
If immature or dysplastic cells are observed, examine peripheral blood smears for new or 
worsening morphological abnormalities (e.g., teardrop and nucleated red blood cells, 
immature white blood cells) or cytopenia(s). 
If the patient develops new or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s), 
discontinue treatment with Revolade and consider a bone marrow biopsy, including 
staining for fibrosis. 
Haematological malignancies 
•  
•  
•  
The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by 
excluding other clinical entities with thrombocytopenia. Consideration should be given to 
performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy over the course of the disease and 
treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, those with systemic symptoms or 
abnormal signs. 
Educate patients about the theoretical risk of haematological malignancies with 
thrombopoietin receptor agonists. 
Importance of not using Revolade outside the context of its license unless in a clinical trial 
setting. 
Potential for Off-label Use 
•  
•  
The risk-benefit for the treatment of thrombocytopenia outside of the registered indication 
has not been established. 
The risk-benefit of Revolade in paediatric ITP and paediatric HCV-associated 
thrombocytopenia has not been established. The paediatric population is defined as those 
persons aged between 0 and 18 years. 
Hepatic Decompensation (use with interferon) 
•  Chronic HCV patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when 
• 
• 
receiving alfa-interferon therapy 
Educate thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV that safety findings suggestive of 
hepatic decompensation were reported more frequently in patients treated with 
eltrombopag/interferon/ribavirin. 
Thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV with low albumin (≤ 35 g/L) or Model for End-
Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥ 10 at baseline had a greater risk of hepatic 
decompensation when treated with eltrombopag/interferon/ribavirin. Patients with these 
signs should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation. 
Fatal Adverse Events in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV 
• 
In thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV, patients who receive anti viral therapy in 
combination with eltrombopag may be at greater risk of fatal adverse events, particularly 
those with the poorest prognosis, i.e.:

• 
• 
o  MELD score ≥10,  
o  Albumin ≤ 35 g/L  
Educate patients with the poorest prognosis about the increased risk of fatal adverse events, 
particularly hepatic decompensation (hepatic failure, ascites, encephalopathy and bleeding 
varices), infective and ischemic complications. 
Treatment with eltrombopag should be stopped if signs and symptoms suggestive of 
thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation occur (see TEE and hepatic decompensation 
above). 
Additional Data/Market exclusivity 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant, taking into account the 
provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers, by consensus that 
the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing 
therapies.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Study 17957 investigated the effect of fixed-dose 
include information for recommended starting dose 
for riociguat for patients who are on stable doses of 
strong multi pathway cytochrome P450 proteins 
(CYP) and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors based on date from 
Study 17957 which investigated the potential 
pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral agents 
as fixed-dose combination and riociguat in HIV 
patients, data from a statistical drug-drug interaction 
(DDI) which was evaluated in study 18634, in which 
antiretroviral therapies,  Atripla, Complera, Stribild, 
Triumeq, or any approved antiretroviral protease inhibitor 
in combination with (preferably) Triumeq, on the exposure 
to riociguat in HIV patients on a stable dose of one of these 
therapies. Comparison with limited historical data indicated 
no effect of Atripla on the AUC of riociguat, while HIV 
combined therapy including ritonavir boosted protease 
inhibitors, Complera, Stribild and Triumeq increased the 
exposure by 18, 88, 88 and 159%, respectively. In vitro 
data showed that the increase is mainly due to inhibition of

CYP1A1, and partial due to inhibition of CYP3A4. The 
plasma concentrations in all HIV non-PH patients were in 
the range of the observed plasma riociguat concentrations 
in healthy subjects and healthy subjects receiving riociguat 
on top of ketoconazole. Taking into account the observed 
safety (albeit after a single dose) and vital signs, it is 
considered that, with application of the reduced starting 
dose of 0.5 mg here times a day, prescribers can manage 
this risk of hypotension caused by riociguat. Sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC have been updated as a 
consequence. The Package leaflet Labelling has been 
updated accordingly.

single-arm, uncontrolled, phase IIIb study of 
riociguat in patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) who demonstrate an insufficient 
response to treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 
inhibitors (PDE-5i). Section 4.5 of the SmPC was 
updated in parallel to reflect on the main study 
transitioning between sildenafil or tadalafil and Adempas 
were made: Patients stopping sildenafil must wait at least 
24 hours before taking Adempas. Patients stopping tadalafil 
must wait at least 48 hours before taking Adempas. 
Patients stopping Adempas to change to another medicine 
called a PDE5 inihibitor (e.g. sildenafil or tadalafil) must 
wait at least 24 hours from their last dose of Adempas 
before taking the PDE5 inhibitor. Signs and symptoms of 
hypotension should be monitored after any transition.

contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl

messages in sections 4.3 and 4.6 with regards to 
pregnancy. 
Furthermore, section 4.5 of the SmPC was updated 
to correct the list of CYP isoforms involved in the 
metabolism of riociguat based on in vitro data. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to bring the Product

“Patients must not get pregnant during Adempas therapy 
(see section 4.3). Riociguat (2.5 mg three times per day) 
did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the plasma 
levels of combined oral contraceptives containing 
levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol when concomitantly 
administered to healthy female subjects. Based on this 
study and as riociguat is not an inducer of any of the 
relevant metabolic enzymes, also no pharmacokinetic 
interaction is expected with other hormonal 
contraceptives.” 
Furthermore, the existing messages conveyed in sections 
4.3 and 4.6 with regards to pregnancy have been 
reinforced in section 4.4 of the SmPC as follows:  
“Pregnancy/contraception 
Adempas is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 
4.3). Therefore, female patients at potential risk of 
pregnancy must use an effective method of contraception. 
Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended.”

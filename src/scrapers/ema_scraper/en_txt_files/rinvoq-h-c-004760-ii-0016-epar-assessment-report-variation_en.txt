Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is represented by a group of diseases that share common genetic, clinical, and 
radiographic features. Adult SpA patients are commonly categorized by the two predominant 
manifestations of disease:  axial SpA, which primarily involves the spine and sacroiliac (SI) joints, or 
peripheral SpA, which primarily involves peripheral joints. Further, axial SpA encompasses a spectrum 
of inflammatory conditions involving the axial skeleton with two distinct entities, ankylosing spondylitis 
(AS), which requires the presence of sacroiliitis on plain conventional radiographs as defined by the 
modified New York criteria and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), which does not 
meet the 1984 modified New York imaging criteria. Patients with nr axSpA and AS share common 
epidemiological, genetic, and clinical disease characteristics, including disease activity, and similar 
response to treatment however, presence (AS) or absence (nr-axSpA) of radiographic findings serve as 
an important differentiating characteristic between the two categories of axSpA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 7/104 
 
 
 
 
The prevalence of AS differs between regions and has been estimated to be up to 0.5% with similar 
estimated prevalence rates for nr-axSpA, resulting in an overall prevalence for axSpA in the US and in 
the EU of approximately up to 1% or higher. 
The MAH applied for the following indication: “RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in adult patients with objective signs of inflammation 
who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).” 
Management 
In 2016, the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) and European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published updated treatment recommendations for axial SpA. The first-
line treatment of axial SpA consists of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  In patients with 
persistently high disease activity despite a course of two NSAIDs given over a total of at least 4 weeks, 
initiation of a bDMARD is recommended, and current practice is to start with a tumor necrosis factor 
alpha inhibitor (TNFi).  If TNFi therapy fails, switching to another TNFi or an interleukin (IL)-17 
inhibitor (IL-17i) is recommended.  
Overall, available treatment options remain limited, particularly for nr-axSpA as compared to other 
rheumatic diseases such as RA or PsA. In axSpA, conventional synthetic disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and long-term corticosteroids are not efficacious and therefore not 
recommended for treatment of axial symptoms. Once patients have an inadequate response to 
NSAIDs, and more advanced systemic therapies are required, available biologics are all administered 
either subcutaneous (SQ) or intravenous. To date, there have been no oral targeted therapies 
approved for the treatment of nr axSpA. However, upadacitinib was recently approved for the AS 
indication in the EU, as an additional treatment option based on the Phase 2/3 study in AS bDMARD-
naïve subjects (Study M16-098, SELECT-AXIS 1). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Rinvoq (upadacitinib) is a selective and reversible Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. As per the approved EU 
SmPC, it is currently authorized for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Ankylosing 
spondylitis, Atopic dermatitis (AD) and has received a positive opinion during the May 2022 CHMP for 
Ulcerative Colitis (UC). 
For Rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended dose is, 
according to section 4.2 of the SmPC, 15 mg once daily. For Atopic dermatitis, the recommended dose 
of upadacitinib is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily based on individual patient presentation. For Ulcerative 
Colitis, the recommended dose is 45mg for the induction phase once daily and 15 mg or 30 mg once 
daily for the maintenance phase. 
The proposed dose for the new indication is 15 mg once daily. 
EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, has started a review of the safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used 
to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis).  
The review was prompted by the final results from a clinical trial (study A3921133) of the JAK inhibitor 
Xeljanz (tofacitinib). The results showed that patients taking Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and who 
were at risk of heart disease were more likely to experience a major cardiovascular problem (such as 
heart attack, stroke or death due to cardiovascular disease) and had a higher risk of developing cancer 
than those treated with medicines belonging to the class of TNF-alpha inhibitors. The study also 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 8/104 
 
 
 
showed that compared with TNF-alpha inhibitors, Xeljanz was associated with a higher risk of death 
due to any cause, serious infections, and blood clots in the lungs and in deep veins (venous 
thromboembolism, VTE).  
In addition, preliminary findings from an observational study involving another JAK inhibitor, Olumiant 
(baricitinib), also suggest an increased risk of major cardiovascular problems and VTE in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis treated with Olumiant compared with those treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors.  
In the treatment of inflammatory disorders, Olumiant and other JAK inhibitors work in a similar way to 
Xeljanz. PRAC is therefore carrying out a review to determine whether these risks are associated with 
all JAK inhibitors authorised in the EU for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and whether the 
marketing authorisations for these medicines should be amended. 
The review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the 
request of the European Commission (EC) under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is 
currently on-going. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
A Scientific Advice, with implications for the present Application was received from the CHMP in 2019 
(EMEA/H/SA/3190/8/2019/II). Compliance with the Scientific Advice is commented on throughout the 
report. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided an ERA to include the new indication of non-Radiographic Axial Spondylarthritis 
(nr-axSpA); however, no new data for the environmental risk assessment were included with this 
application. The submitted ERA was updated from the original ERA submitted for the MAA for RA 
approval, and the updates to support the indications psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic 
dermatitis and active ulcerative colitis. 
In the original ERA the results of the Phase I assessment triggered a Phase II Tier A assessment and 
the standard suite of fate and effect studies were completed. 
Upadacitinib is very persistent in sediment according to the OECD 308 study. A Phase II Tier B 
extended effects on water sediment was thus triggered. 
Phase I 
The maximum daily dose for the indication nr-axSpA is 15 mg/day, resulting in PECSURFACEWATER values 
of 0.075 µg/L, for each of the indications RA, PsA and AS, with the maximum daily dose of 15 mg/day, 
the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.075 µg/L, for the indication AD with the maximum daily dose of 15 
mg/day, the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.15 µg/L and for the indication UC with the maximum daily 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 9/104 
 
 
 
dose of 45 mg/day, the PECSURFACEWATER values was 0.225 µg/L when using the default Fpen value of 
0.01. 
A PECSW-TOTAL was calculated (0.68 µg/L) and was used to re-calculate the Phase II Tier A and Tier B 
PEC/PNEC ratios.  
The Log Pow and Log D were 2.50 (pH 7) using the shake flask method (OECD 107). Since the values 
were below the criteria of 3 no PBT assessment was needed. 
Phase II 
For this application, the same PNEC values were presented as for the original ERA submitted for the 
MAA. In the table below the updated PEC/PNEC ratios are presented, based on the PEC value obtained 
for all six indications. These ratios remain far below 0.1, and the conclusion remains: The clinical use 
of upadacitinib is not expected to be a risk for the environment. 
The PEC values in relevant environmental compartments are compared to the PNEC values for these 
compartments by calculation of PEC/PNEC ratios.

2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of upadacitinib were thoroughly evaluated during the original approval 
procedure for Rinvoq. No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Considering the above data, upadacitinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Upadacitinib is proposed to be used in nr-axSpA, at dose of 15 mg QD using the extended-release 
formulation. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected in 36% of the subjects from Study 1 (bDMARD-IR 
AS) and 47% of the subjects from Study 2 (nr-axSpA) of Study M19-944.  Summary of upadacitinib 
pharmacokinetics in Study M19-944, and a comparison of upadacitinib pharmacokinetics to subjects 
with AS, who are bDMARD naïve, and subjects with RA are presented in Figure 1.

Naïve AS (Study M16-098) and bDMARD-IR AS/nr-axSpA (Study M19-944) Populations 
Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in subjects in Study 2 (nr-axSpA) were characterized through 
population pharmacokinetics approach using data from the Phase 3 Study M19-944 (Study M19-944 
PopPK Report). Data from Study M19-944 were also used to characterize the relationships between 
upadacitinib plasma exposures and efficacy as well as safety in subjects with nr-axSpA.  
Methods 
Quantification of upadacitinib  
Specific and sensitive bioanalytical assays, developed and validated using high performance liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the quantitation of upadacitinib in 
human plasma have been described in the regulatory application for the use of upadacitinib in the 
treatment of RA. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using data from Study M19-944 (Study 1 and 
Study 2, Table 2). Results from prior population pharmacokinetic analyses using data from healthy 
subjects, subjects with RA, and subjects with AS, who are bDMARD-naïve, were leveraged to inform 
upadacitinib pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with AS, who are bDMARD-IR, and subjects with 
nr-axSpA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 12/104 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected in approximately 30% of the subjects with AS, who are 
bDMARD-IR, and subjects with nr-axSpA in Study M19-944. All pharmacokinetic data collected before 
first dose or > 168 hours after last dose were excluded from the analyses. 
Table 2. Summary of Data Included in the Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response 
Analyses for Efficacy and Safety 
Due to differences in bioanalytical assay between AbbVie bioanalysis and the bioanalytical lab in China 
(used only for samples collected in China), upadacitinib concentrations measured at WuXi lab in China 
were systematically higher compared to samples analyzed at AbbVie, by an average of 11%; based on 
a cross-validation analysis. To account for the analytical difference between the two laboratories, all 
upadacitinib plasma concentrations for samples collected in China and for all samples analyzed at 
WuXiAppTec Co., upadacitinib exposure were adjusted (decreased) in the dataset by 11% in the 
population pharmacokinetics analysis.  
The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay of plasma samples of Study M19-944 for the 
determination of upadacitinib concentrations is 0.05 ng/mL. The first upadacitinib concentration value 
below the LLOQ after each dose was set to one-half of the LLOQ.  All subsequent concentrations below 
the LLOQ recorded after the last dose were excluded from the modeling exercise. A total of 13 records 
(2.9%) were below the LLOQ. 
A previously built population pharmacokinetic model for upadacitinib in healthy volunteers, subjects 
with RA and AS (first presented in variation EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005), who are bDMARD-naïve,1 
was leveraged for this analysis.  No new covariates were investigated and the covariate model from 
this original model was used. To assess adequacy of the established population pharmacokinetics 
model to describe upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in subjects with AS who are bDMARD-IR and subjects 
with nr-axSpA, a visual predictive check (VPC) was performed using the parameter estimates for fixed 
and random effects from the previous model. After positive evaluation of the VPC, the population 
parameter estimates of the fixed effects and estimates for the random effects (inter-individual 
variability) of the previously established population pharmacokinetic model were used to generate 
individual post hoc estimates ($ESTIMATION MAXEVAL=0 in NONMEM) for subjects in Study M19-944. 
Standard model selection criteria and figures and summary statistics for evaluation of the model were 
used. 
Final model  
Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics were described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption 
for the immediate release formulation, mixed zero- and first-order absorption with lag time for the 
extended-release formulation, and linear first-order elimination. The parameter estimates for fixed and 
random effects from the AS model are in Table 3.  
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 13/104 
 
 
 
 
Statistically significant covariates identified in the final AS model included subject/patient population 
(RA/AS versus healthy), creatinine clearance, body weight on CL/F, and body weight on Vc/F.  For this 
population PK modeling exercise of upadacitinib in subjects with AS, who are bDMARD-IR, and in 
subjects with nr-axSpA, the model parameters were left unchanged from the final AS model and were 
not re-estimated.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
The objectives of these analyses were to evaluate the relationships between upadacitinib plasma 
exposures and efficacy and safety in subjects with nr-axSpA. Model-estimated upadacitinib average 
plasma concentration (Cavg) in the active treatment arms were derived using empirical Bayesian 
estimates from the population PK analysis. 
The efficacy/safety dataset contained Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS40 
and ASAS20) response at Week 14, laboratory safety variables at Week 14, upadacitinib average 
plasma concentration (Cavg) generated from the empirical Bayesian individual estimates from the 
population PK model, bDMARD-IR status, baseline disease activity measures, and baseline laboratory 
parameters (hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets and lymphocyte count). 
Exposure-response quartile plots, with upadacitinib Cavg as the exposure metric, were generated for 
the efficacy and safety endpoints. No exposure-response modeling was conducted, and therefore the 
covariate effects on exposure-response relationships with efficacy and safety were not evaluated. 
Exposure-efficacy analysis (only Study 2) 
Exposure-response quartile plots for the percentage of subjects with nr-axSpA, who were included in 
the exposure-response analyses and achieved ASAS20 or ASAS40 response at Week 14 versus 
upadacitinib Cavg are presented in Figure 3.  Upadacitinib Cavg values associated with 15 mg QD dose 
(9.08 to 38.2 ng/mL) were associated with higher ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates compared to 
placebo.  Within the upadacitinib 15 mg QD treatment arm, no clear trends for exposure-response 
relationship were observed for ASAS20 or ASAS40.

axSpA (Study 2) 
Exposure-safety analysis (only Study 2) 
Exposure-response quartile plots were generated to identify safety variables demonstrating 
upadacitinib exposure-dependent changes. Subjects were binned according to their individual model-
predicted plasma exposures into quartiles, and the percent of subjects with specific safety 
events/laboratory changes were plotted for each quartile.  
There were no clear trends in the exposure-response relationships with upadacitinib Cavg and any 
infections, changes in platelet counts, and >1g/dL increase in haemoglobin.  Among the subjects 
included in the exposure-response analysis, there were no events of serious infection, no events of 
neutropenia ≥ Grade 3, no events of lymphopenia ≥ Grade 3, no events of platelets ≥ 600 × 109/L, 2 
events of herpes zoster infection, 1 event of pneumonia, and 2 events of > 2 g/dL decrease in 
hemoglobin. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The analytical method has been validated and accepted previously (see EPAR for the initial marketing 
authorisation application). Satisfactory method performance during study sample analysis was 
demonstrated. 
The objectives of the clinical pharmacology program were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
upadacitinib in the nr-axSpA population and derive individual average concentrations, subsequently 
used to evaluate the relationships between upadacitinib plasma exposures and efficacy as well as 
safety using data from Study 2 in study M19-944. All subjects received 15 mg QD treatment. The data 
were evaluated using population PK analysis, and graphical evaluation of exposure-response.  
Population pharmacokinetic model 
The MAH used the already developed population PK model to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
upadacitinib in subjects with AS who are bDMARD-IR and in subjects with nr-axSpA. A small trend in 
the GOF plots indicates that the model has problems capturing some of the lower observed 
concentrations. The VPCs show a similar trend at the later timepoints (time since last dose). Given the 
purpose of the model, the model adequately captures the exposure in subjects with AS and nr-AxSpA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 16/104 
 
 
 
 
The model estimated Cavg (used in exposure response analysis), for nr-axSpA subjects was 14.8 (10.5 
- 25.5) ng/mL, respectively. The stratified figures show that the pharmacokinetics are consistent within 
the axial spondyloarthritis population. 
Exposure-response 
The exposure-efficacy analyses on achieving ASAS20 and ASAS40 at Week 14 demonstrated a higher 
response for the upadacitinib 15 mg QD arm compared to placebo for the nr-axSpA population (Study 
2). There was no trend toward higher response rates with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures 
within the 15 mg QD arm.  
The exposure-safety analyses showed no clear trends for the probability of experiencing any infections, 
changes in platelet counts, or >1g decrease in hemoglobin from baseline, with increasing upadacitinib 
exposures. Other safety variables were not analysed due to too low number events. The MAH did not 
pool the exposure safety analysis for the AS and nr-AxSpA population; however, as the safety with a 
15 mg dose is established, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Adequate methods have been used to evaluate the PK and exposure-response in subjects with nr-
axSpA. See 2.4.3. for further discussion on the dose. 
The CHMP concluded that the application was approvable from a clinical pharmacology perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The support for the efficacy of upadacitinib for the new indication nr-axSpA is primarily derived from 
the pivotal study M19-944 in nr-axSpA. Supportive data is claimed from study M16-098 in a related 
condition i.e. bDMARD-naïve AS.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response study was conducted for this application. 
Exposure-response analyses comparing 15 mg dose to placebo were conducted to characterize the 
relationships between upadacitinib plasma exposures and clinical efficacy and safety in subjects with 
nr-axSpA using data from Study M19-944 Study 2. The efficacy endpoints evaluated for relationships 
with upadacitinib exposures included ASAS20 and ASAS40 response at Week 14. No trends towards 
increased efficacy with increasing upadacitinib exposures were observed for ASAS20 or ASAS40; 
however, only 15 mg was given. Results of the exposure-safety analyses through Week 14 showed no 
clear trends for the probability of experiencing any infections (including serious infections, herpes 
zoster, and pneumonia), lymphopenia, neutropenia, changes in platelet counts, and decrease in 
hemoglobin from Baseline, with increasing upadacitinib exposures. 
The MAH states that in the exposure-response analyses for the effect of upadacitinib on the probability 
of achieving ASAS20 and ASAS40 at Week 14, there was no evidence for increased efficacy responses 
with increasing upadacitinib exposures within the 15 mg QD arm.  These results indicate that 
exposures associated with 15 mg QD maximize efficacy in treatment of patients with nr-axSpA. In the 
exposure-response analyses for safety through Week 14 in subjects with nr-axSpA, there were no 
trends observed between upadacitinib exposures and changes in laboratory parameters or adverse 
events (AEs).  These safety-exposure relationships are consistent with previous analyses conducted in 
subjects with bDMARD-naïve AS. Overall, the results of these population pharmacokinetic and 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 17/104 
 
 
 
exposure-response analyses support a favourable benefit risk profile of upadacitinib 15 mg QD for 
treatment of patients with nr-axSpA. 
The MAH states that dose selection was also informed by results from the exposure-response analyses 
conducted based on data from upadacitinib Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in RA. The extended-release 
tablet formulation of upadacitinib was evaluated in the pivotal Study M19-944. 
Methods 
Study M19-944 Study 2 (nr-axSpA) is an ongoing multicenter study with an overall design as outlined 
in the figure below. 
AS = ankylosing spondylitis; ASAS = Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society; bDMARD-IR = biologic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs inadequate responder; DB = double-blind; IR = inadequate response; nr-
axSpA = non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis; PBO = placebo; QD = once daily; UPA = upadacitinib; Wk = week 
Figure 4: Study M19-944 Study 2 Design Schematic 
Study M19-944 utilizes a "master protocol" that includes 2 independent studies for subjects with active 
axSpA:  biologic DMARD-inadequate responders (bDMARD-IRs) AS (Study 1) and nr-axSpA (Study 2).  
While this protocol includes a common screening platform and other operational elements for Study 1 
and Study 2, randomization and data collection are conducted for each study independently.  There is 
no overlap in subject population, nor is there a shared control group.  Each study has its own 
objective, hypothesis testing, and adequate power for primary and secondary endpoints.  The analyses 
and reporting for the 2 studies are therefore separate and each study represents a standalone study 
for regulatory purposes. 
The Clinical Study Report (CSR) presents the complete 14-week results from Study 2 in subjects with 
active nr-axSpA.  Efficacy data are presented up to Week 14.  Safety data and subject disposition are 
presented up to the cut-off date (26 August 2021), which includes summaries of all data up to Week 
14, summaries of available data up to Week 52, as well as summaries of available long-term data up 
to the cut-off date. 
As apparent from the above figure, Study 2 includes a 35-day Screening Period; a 52-week Double-
Blind Period, a 52-week Open-Label Extension (OLE) Period and a 30-day F/U Visit. A 30-day F/U

phone call may be performed in place of a visit to determine the status of any ongoing adverse events 
(AEs)/serious adverse event (SAE) or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs is required; these subjects 
will be considered as having completed the study (see further below). Subjects with that meet protocol 
defined remission criteria are eligible for the open-label Remission-Withdrawal Period (see further 
below). 
According to the MAH, data from the OLE Period and Remission-Withdrawal Period will be reported in 
subsequent summaries/submissions.

Subjects who met the eligibility criteria are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
or placebo, up to the Week 52 (Double-Blind period). 
Subjects in the placebo group are switched to upadacitinib 15 mg QD at Week 52 in the OLE Period.  
The OLE Period is a 52-week open-label extension to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD in extended treatment in subjects with nr-axSpA who completed Double-Blind 
Period on study drug.  All subjects are to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD during the OLE Period. 
The MAH study team was unblinded to perform the Week 14 primary analysis.  The unblinding took 
place after all subjects in the study completed the Week 14 visit or prematurely discontinued prior to 
Week 14.  Sites and subjects will remain blinded to the Double Blind Period treatment assignments for 
the duration of the study. 
Remission-Withdrawal Period:  Subjects that meet protocol defined remission criteria  are eligible for 
the open-label Remission-Withdrawal Period.   
Subjects who are not in remission at Week 104 will complete the study after the 30 day follow-up visit 
OR, if applicable, will have the option to enter open-label treatment with upadacitinib until a predefined 
time period only per local country requirements. 
Study drug includes the investigational product of upadacitinib and matching upadacitinib placebo.  
Study drug is to be taken orally QD, beginning on Day 1 (Baseline), and is to be taken at 
approximately the same time each day, with or without food.

MAH’s descriptions of the outcome measures used for study endpoints multiplicity-controlled secondary 
and additional endpoints 
ASAS20 Response:  Improvement of ≥ 20% and absolute improvement of ≥ 1 unit (on a scale of 0 to 
10) from Baseline in ≥ 3 of the above mentioned 4 domains (see description of primary endpoint), with 
no deterioration in the remaining domain (defined as a worsening of ≥ 20% and a net worsening of ≥ 1 
unit). 
ASAS Partial Remission:  Absolute score of ≤ 2 units for each of the 4 domains mentioned above. 
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA) (NRS score 0 – 10):  Subject rated axSpA/AS 
disease activity, measured on a 0 to 10 NRS, where higher scores indicate higher disease activity. 
BASDAI:  The BASDAI assesses disease activity levels and consists of 6 questions measured on a 0 to 
10 NRS pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of axSpA/AS:  fatigue; spinal pain (neck, back, hips); 
peripheral joint pain/swelling; areas of localized tenderness (also called enthesitis, or inflammation of 
tendons and ligaments); and morning stiffness (severity and duration).  The overall BASDAI score 
ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.  Questions 1 through 5 
have responses that can range from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); Question 6 has a response range 
from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (2 or more hours), and 5 represents 1 hour. 
BASDAI50:  BASDAI50 response is defined as ≥ 50% improvement from Baseline in the BASDAI score. 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)(CRP):  The ASDAS is a validated composite 
index that combines the following 5 disease activity variables:  spinal pain (BASDAI Question 2; NRS 
score 0 – 10), peripheral joint pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3; NRS score 0 – 10), duration of 
morning stiffness (BASDAI Question 6; NRS score 0 – 10), PtGA, and hsCRP.  Higher scores indicate 
more active disease. 
ASDAS (CRP) Disease Activity States and Response Categories:  The ASDAS is categorized into the 
following ASDAS disease activity states and response categories: 
•  ASDAS ID:  ASDAS < 1.3 
•  ASDAS LDA:  ASDAS < 2.1 
•  ASDAS Major Improvement:  a change from baseline ≤ –2.0 
•  ASDAS Clinically Important Improvement: a change from baseline ≤ –1.1 
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP):  A laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute 
phase reactant of inflammation in peripheral blood.  A decrease in the level of hsCRP indicates 
reduction in systemic inflammation. 
Patient-reported measure of inflammation (mean of BASDAI Questions 5 and 6):  severity of morning 
stiffness from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe) and duration of morning stiffness 0 = 0 hours, 5 = 1 hour, 
10 = 2 or more hours. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 23/104 
 
 
 
Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain (NRS score 0 – 10):  No pain is indicated by 0 and most 
severe pain by 10. 
Back pain, including neck, back, hips (BASDAI Question 2):  Patient's assessment of overall level of 
axSpA/AS neck, back or hip pain, from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). 
Patient's Assessment of Nocturnal Back Pain:  Measures the amount of back pain at night on a 0 – 10 
NRS, with a score of 0 indicating "no pain" and a score of 10 indicating "worst possible pain." 
Peripheral joint pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3):  Patient's assessment of overall level of 
pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back, or hip pain, from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). 
Patient's Global Assessment of Pain (NRS score 0 – 10):  No pain is indicated by 0 and severe pain by 
10. 
Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI):  BASFI assesses functional limitations in 
axSpA/AS.  It consists of 10 items measured on a 0 to 10 NRS, with 0 = easy and 10 = impossible, 
and assesses the subject's ability to perform activities such as dressing, bending, reaching, turning, 
and climbing steps.  The total score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse 
functioning. 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire: ASQoL is an axSpA/AS specific QoL 
measure that consists of 18 items and evaluates concepts such as ability to perform activities of daily 
living, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue, and sleep problems.  Each item on the ASQoL is given a 
score of "1" or "0," where a score of "1" is given when an item is affirmed, indicating adverse QoL.  
Total scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores representing worse QoL. 
ASAS Health Index (HI):  ASAS HI is an instrument for use in patients with axSpA/AS.  It consists of 
17 items measuring aspects of global functioning and health that are typical and relevant for axSpA 
patients.  Items are scored dichotomously (0 = do not agree; 1 = agree) and assess pain, emotional 
function, sleep, sexual function, mobility, self-care, and community life.  Total scores range from 0 to 
17, with lower scores indicating better health. 
36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36):  Generic health-related QoL instrument consisting of 8 
domains:  physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to 
emotional health problems, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, and general health.  
Range for each domain is 0 – 100; higher scores indicate better outcomes.  Two summary scores are 
derived from the 8 domains:  the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS) score and the SF-
36 Mental Component Summary (SF-36 MCS) score. 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-F):  13-item patient-reported 
measure of fatigue.  Score ranges from 0 – 52; higher scores represent less fatigue. 
Fatigue/Tiredness (BASDAI Question 1):  Patient's assessment of overall fatigue tiredness from 0 
(none) to 10 (very severe). 
MASES:  MASES assesses enthesitis in patients with axSpA/AS.  The presence (score = 1) or absence 
(score = 0) of enthesitis is clinically assessed at 13 pre-defined sites:  Bilateral 1st Costochondral joint, 
7th Costochondral joint, Posterior Superior Iliac Spine, Anterior Superior Iliac Spine, Iliac Crest, and 
Proximal Insertion of Achilles tendon; the 5th Lumbar Spinous process was also graded for enthesitis, 
yielding a total score ranging 0 – 13. 
BASMI:  BASMI assesses spinal mobility in patients with axSpA/AS.  The linear BASMI (BASMIlin) 
composite score is calculated using the BASMI components:  lateral lumbar flexion; tragus to wall 
distance, lumbar flexion, intermalleolar, and cervical rotation.  Scores for each assessment range from 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 24/104 
 
 
 
0 to 10, and the BASMIlin total score is the average of the 5 assessment scores.  Higher scores 
indicate decreased spinal mobility. 
MRI SPARCC of SI joint score:  Scoring is conducted on 6 consecutive slices of the short-tau inversion 
recovery image sequence.  Each consecutive slice is scored separately for the right and left joint in all 
4 quadrants of the SI joint.  The maximum possible score for any individual slice is 12, with a 
maximum score for all 6 slices being 72. 
MRI SPARCC Spine score:  In total, 23 discovertebral units (DVUs) are assessed by a reviewer per 
subject and time point, and the 6 most severely affected DVUs are selected by each reviewer and used 
to calculate the MRI Spine SPARCC score.  The maximum score for all 6 DVUs is 108. 
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein:  An objective laboratory measure of inflammation is hsCRP (ULN is 
2.87 mg/L), described above as part of the ASDAS (CRP) composite score. 
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity:  Physician assessment of the subject's current 
disease activity using a 0 – 10 NRS, with a score of 0 indicating absence of disease activity and a score 
of 10 indicating severe activity 
Estimand 
As per the study protocol, the primary efficacy analysis will use the composite estimand framework, 
where the Week 14 primary endpoint for both studies is defined as a composite endpoint that is 
achieved if a subject fulfils the following 2 components:  1) Remain in the study and on study drug 
through 14 weeks; and 2) Achieve an ASAS40 response at Week 14.   
Corresponding to this estimand, in the primary analysis, subjects who discontinue study drug prior to 
Week 14 will be treated as non-responders.  Missing data due to COVID-19 will be imputed using 
Multiple Imputation and additional missing data due to other reasons will be treated as non-
responders. 
Sample size 
The planned total sample size of 304 for Study 2 (with a 1:1 randomization ratio for placebo and 
upadacitinib 15 mg) provides at least 90% power for the primary endpoint ASAS40 response of 
upadacitinib 15 mg versus placebo using a two-sided Chi-square test at 0.05 level. For ASAS40 at 
Week 14, the assumed response rates for upadacitinib and placebo are 42% and 17%, respectively.  
In addition, this sample size provides at least 80% power for several of the multiplicity-controlled 
secondary endpoints including change from Baseline in ASDAS, change from Baseline in MRI SPARCC 
score of SI joints, BASDAI 50 response, ASDAS Inactive Disease, change from Baseline in Total Back 
Pain, change from Baseline in Nocturnal Back Pain, ASDAS Low Disease Activity, ASAS PR, and Week 
52 ASAS40 response (multiplicity-controlled for EU/EMA regulatory purpose only). 
Randomisation 
According to the study protocol, all subjects are to be assigned a unique identification number by the 
IRT at the screening visit.  For subjects who re-screen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at 
the initial screening visit should be used.  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode 
the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the 
statistics department at AbbVie. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups; Group 1:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
and Group 2:  placebo QD.

Randomization was stratified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and screening high sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hsCRP) status (MRI+/hsCRP > upper limit of normal [ULN], MRI+/hsCRP ≤ ULN, and 
MRI–/hsCRP > ULN) and exposure to bDMARDs (yes versus [vs] no).  At least 20%, but not exceeding 
35% of subjects with prior exposure to a bDMARD were enrolled in Study 2 (nr-axSpA).   
Blinding (masking) 
According to the study protocol, for Study 2 in nr-axSpA, all AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of 
the conduct and management of the trial (with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management 
Team) will remain blinded to each subject's treatment until the Week 14 primary analysis, while the 
Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment until 
after all subjects have completed the Week 52 visit or have prematurely discontinued prior to Week 
52.  
 For Study 1 and Study 2, sites and subjects will remain blinded to the Double-Blind Period treatment 
assignments for the duration of the respective study.  To maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets 
and placebo tablets provided for each study will be identical in appearance.  The IRT will provide 
access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency. 
Statistical methods 
General 
There are three sets of planned efficacy analysis:  
- 
- 
- 
efficacy analysis up to Week 14 in the Double-Blind Period 
efficacy analysis up to Week 52 in the Double-Blind Period, and 
long-term efficacy analysis up to Week 104. 
Efficacy data are presented up to Week 14. Safety data and subject disposition are presented up to the 
cutoff date (26 August 2021), which includes summaries of data up to Week 14, summaries of 
available data up to Week 52, as well as summaries of all available long-term data up to the cutoff 
date. 
Analysis sets 
All efficacy analyses were conducted using the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which includes all randomized 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In addition, per-protocol (PP) analysis for the 
primary endpoint was performed based on PP analysis set, consisting of all FAS subjects who did not 
have any major protocol violations that impact primary efficacy analysis. The Safety Analysis Set 
consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Primary analyses at Week 14 
The primary efficacy endpoint and multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints were analyzed at Week 
14, by methods briefly described in table below. 
Endpoints 
Primary Analysis Methods 
Proportion of subjects 
achieving: 
• ASAS40 response 
• BASDAI50 response 
• Point estimate, 95% CI, and p-value for the treatment 
comparison between upadacitinib group and placebo group are 
based on NRI-MI inference from multiple imputed datasets, where 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for stratification factor 
of MRI and screening hsCRP status (MRI+/hsCRP > ULN,

MRI+/hsCRP ≤ ULN, and MRI–/hsCRP > ULN) and baseline value 
as covariate. 
• For the analysis of change from baseline in MRI SPARCC SI joint 
score, the ANCOVA model also includes the interaction between 
treatment group and the stratification factor of MRI and screening 
hsCRP status. 
• Analysis Set: FAS 
Change from Baseline in: 
• ASDAS (CRP)

• ASQoL 
• ASAS HI 
• BASMIlin 
• MASES 
Handling of Missing Data and Intercurrent Events  
Intercurrent events include discontinuation of study drug and initiation of rescue medication. Missing 
data and intercurrent events were handled using the following methods for the efficacy analysis. 
Binary endpoints 
The primary estimand for binary endpoints is the composite estimand. NRI-MI and NRI analysis were 
used for the primary estimand. 
Non-responder imputation in conjunction with multiple imputation (NRI-MI) was used as the 
primary approach for handling missing data and intercurrent events for the primary estimand. It 
handles intercurrent events and missing data as follows: 
a. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug or use rescue therapy are categorized as non-
responders for visits after study drug discontinuation or rescue initiation. 
b. Missing data due to COVID-19 infection or logistical restriction are handled by multiple imputation. 
c. Additional missing data due to other reasons are categorized as non-responders. 
For composite binary endpoints such as ASAS40, ASAS20 and ASAS PR, missing values in the 
continuous component variables were imputed via MI, and the composite binary endpoints were 
derived from the multiple imputed continuous component variables. Other binary endpoints which are 
directly dichotomized from a continuous score were handled in a similar way. 
Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) was used as a sensitivity analysis for binary endpoints for the 
primary estimand. It treats intercurrent events and missing data as non-responders (i.e., subjects who 
prematurely discontinue study drug or use rescue therapy are categorized as non-responders for visits 
after study drug discontinuation or rescue initiation; additional missing data including those due to 
COVID-19 infection or logistical restriction are also categorized as non-responders). 
As Observed (AO) data handling was used in a supplementary analysis (following treatment policy 
strategy). By OA data handling, all observed data are used regardless of premature discontinuation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 27/104 
 
 
 
 
 
study drug or use of rescue therapy, while missing data are categorized as non-responders. Sensitivity 
analyses for missing data handling using MI and tipping point were also conducted. 
Continuous endpoints 
The primary estimand for continuous endpoints is the treatment policy estimand, where all observed 
data were used, regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug. MMRM was used as the 
primary approach for handling missing data, and MI was used as a sensitivity analysis. 
Mixed-Effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) was utilized for the treatment policy estimand. 
The mixed model included the categorical fixed effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit 
interaction, main stratification factor of MRI and screening hsCRP level status (MRI+/hsCRP > ULN, 
MRI+/hsCRP ≤ ULN, and MRI-/hsCRP > ULN) and the continuous fixed covariates of baseline 
measurement. 
Multiple Imputation (MI) was used for a sensitivity analysis of the treatment policy estimand. 
Treatment group was included in the MI model to enable stratified sampling. Additionally, the 
imputation model included demographics variables and baseline disease characteristics, as well as 
longitudinal response observed at any other visits. To assess the impact of potential departures from 
the MAR assumption, tipping point analyses was also conducted to as a sensitivity check for 
multiplicity-controlled secondary continuous endpoints. 
Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ASAS40 response at Week 14. The attributes of the primary 
estimand corresponding to the primary efficacy endpoint are as follows: 
Handling of missing data for the primary endpoint 
For the primary estimand, NRI-MI data handling was used. Subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study drug prior Week 14 were categorized as non-responders for visits after study drug 
discontinuation. Missing data due to COVID-19 infection or logistic restriction were handled by MI. 
Additional missing ASAS40 response due to other reasons was categorized as non-responders.  
To facilitate the interpretation of the estimand, ASAS40 response was summarized into the following 
categories for each randomized treatment group: 
1. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug by Week 14; 
2. Subjects who did not discontinue study drug but are missing Week 14 ASAS40 measurements due 
to COVID-19 infection or logistical restriction; 
3. Subjects who did not discontinue study drug but are missing Week 14 ASAS40 measurements due 
to other reasons; 
4. Subjects with ASAS40 measurements observed and on study drug at Week 14. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 28/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analysis for the primary estimand was performed using NRI data handling, and the same 
CMH analysis as described for the primary analysis. 
Supplementary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint under the treatment policy estimand, the 
same CMH method was repeated using As Observed (AO) data, regardless of adherence to study drug. 
Subjects with missing ASAS40 response were categorized as non-responders. 
For the treatment policy estimand, additional sensitivity analyses using AO data were also conducted 
using MI to handle missing ASAS40 responses. In order to assess the deviation from missing at 
random (MAR) assumptions, tipping point analysis was also conducted for the primary endpoint.  
Supportive analyses were also conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set using the same CMH model 
and NRI-MI data handling as the primary analysis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was examined in the pre-specified subgroups. 
Secondary analyses 
For binary endpoints, the primary estimand and analysis method are the same as that for the primary 
efficacy endpoint. NRI-MI and NRI data handling were used to analyze the primary estimand. 
For continuous efficacy endpoints, the primary analyses were performed using all data as observed, 
regardless of adherence to study drug, using the treatment policy estimand framework. The statistical 
inference was conducted using the MMRM model and the associated data handling, with the main 
stratification factor of MRI and screening hsCRP status (MRI+/hsCRP > ULN, MRI+/hsCRP ≤ ULN, and 
MRI–/hsCRP > ULN). For the analysis of change from baseline in MRI SPARCC SI joint score at Week 
14, the ANCOVA model also included the interaction between treatment group and the stratification 
factor of MRI and screening hsCRP status, to account for the potential differences between the MRI+ 
and MRI- strata. The LS mean and 95% CI were reported for each randomized treatment group; the 
LS mean treatment difference and associated 95% CI and p-value were reported comparing 
upadacitinib with the placebo group. For this estimand, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted 
using MI under MAR assumption for multiplicity controlled secondary continuous endpoints. To assess 
deviations from MAR, the tipping point analyses was also conducted as additional sensitivity analyses. 
Multiplicity 
A multiple testing procedure was used to provide strong control of the type I error rate at α = 0.05 (2-
sided) across analyses with respect to the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints. The 
test starts with the primary endpoint using two-sided α = 0.05; significance can be claimed for a lower 
ranked endpoint only if the previous endpoints in the sequence meet the requirement of significance. 
The testing sequence is shown in figure below. Endpoints at Week 14 were tested at the primary 
database lock. The last ranked endpoint ASAS40 at Week 52 (for EU/EMA) will be tested at the Week 
52 database lock. 
The primary endpoint and multiplicity controlled secondary endpoints at Week 14 were analyzed after 
all subjects had completed the Week 14 visit of the Double-Blind Period or had discontinued study by 
Week 14 in the Double-Blind Period and the database had been locked.  
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 29/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim analysis 
No interim analysis was planned for efficacy endpoints. An independent external Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) was used to review unblinded safety data at regular intervals during the conduct of 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 30/104 
 
 
 
 
the study. When needed, high-level unblinded efficacy data may also be requested by the DMC and be 
reviewed so that the DMC can assess benefit:risk of any emerging safety differences. Since there were 
no efficacy analyses for early stopping, no alpha adjustment was needed. 
Safety analysis 
Safety data are presented up to the cutoff date (26 August 2021), which includes summaries of data 
up to Week 14, summaries of available data up to Week 52, as well as summaries of all available long-
term data up to the cutoff date.   
Changes from the analyses 
According to the MAH, the SAP version 4.0, which was dated 15 Sep 2021, was finalized prior to the 
Week 14 database lock and analyses.  
The SAP Version 3.0 was dated 19 Aug 2021 and included, among others, changes to align with the 
Protocol Version 5.0 (which included the updated order of multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints, 
and addition of the remission-withdrawal period), updated methods for handling missing data and 
intercurrent events to address regulatory feedback, updated efficacy subgroup analyses categories, 
etc.  
Changes to the statistical analyses and order of multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints were also 
made in the SAP Version 2 (dated 8 Jan 2021) to align with the Protocol Version 4.0. 
Changes to the planned analyses after finalization of the SAP version 4.0 included the following: per 
regulatory feedback, additional supplementary analyses were conducted for exposure-adjusted event 
rates and incidence rates for overview of TEAE and AESI. The supplementary analyses applied patient 
exposure calculation reflecting the subjects' time at risk, following the definition of the treatment-
emergent period for AEs, which is up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Study disposition is presented in the two below tables. In summary, one subject in the placebo group 
decided not to participate after randomization and discontinued the study before receiving study drug 
and a total of 145 subjects (92.9%) in the upadacitinib group and 150 subjects (95.5%) in the placebo 
group completed study drug up to Week 14.  Up to Week 52, 29 subjects (18.6%) in the upadacitinib 
group and 31 subjects (19.7%) in the placebo group completed study drug.

Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were defined in accordance with the ICH guidelines and ICH-defined categories 
included but were not limited to the following:  eligibility criteria violation, receipt of wrong treatment 
or incorrect dose of study drug, development of withdrawal criteria without being withdrawn, and use 
of prohibited concomitant medications.  In Study 2 (nr-axSpA), eligibility criteria violation was the 
most frequent deviation, see below table. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 36/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 6: Protocol Deviations (All Randomized Subjects) 
According to the MAH, all protocol deviations including non-ICH deviations and all deviations related to 
COVID-19 were reviewed and assessed for their impact on analyses, data integrity, and/or subject 
safety.  The totality of the protocol deviations incurred during the study did not affect the study 
outcomes, interpretation of study results and/or conclusions. 
Treatment compliance 
According to the CSR, compliance was defined as the number of tablets taken divided by the number 
of tablets that should have been taken.  In Study 2, mean treatment compliance by Week 14 was 
97.4% for both groups.

As apparent from the above table, 49 subjects (31.4%) in the upadacitinib group and 54 subjects 
(34.4%) in the placebo group had prior exposure to at least 1 bDMARD.  Among the subjects with prior 
bDMARD exposure, a total of 44 and 43 subjects were exposed to at least 1 tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) inhibitor (TNFi) in the upadacitinib and placebo groups, respectively, while 5 and 14 subjects 
were exposed to at least 1 IL-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) in the upadacitinib and placebo groups, respectively. 
A total of 44.9% in the upadacitinib group and 51.6% in the placebo group had prior csDMARD use.  
All subjects had prior NSAID use and 98.4% of them at least 2 prior NSAID use. 
Up to Week 14 in the Double-Blind Period, 78.2% and 73.2% of subjects in the upadacitinib and 
placebo groups, respectively, took one or more concomitant NSAID.  A total of 26.3% of subjects in 
the upadacitinib group and 31.8% of subjects in the placebo group received concomitant csDMARD 
therapy.  In total 29.1% (across treatment groups) received concomitant csDMARD therapy. A total of 
11.5% of subjects each in the upadacitinib and placebo group took one or more concomitant oral 
corticosteroid. 
High-sensitivity CRP > ULN and > 5 mg/L was reported for 79.6% (80.3% placebo group, 78.8% 
upadacitinib group) and 58.5% (53.5% in placebo group, 63.5% in upadacitinib group) of subjects at 
screening, respectively; MRI inflammation status at screening was positive for 43.5% of subjects 
(42.0% in the placebo group, 44.9% in the upadacitinib group). 
Endpoint related baseline disease characteristics were also tabulated and presented in the CSR. As 
stated in the CSR, subjects had moderately to severely active disease, as indicated by mean BASDAI of 
6.86 (6.91 in the placebo-group and 6.82 in the upadacitinib group) and ASDAS (CRP) of 3.63 (3.65 in 
the placebo group and 3.61 in the upadacitinib group).

conditions (≥ 5% of total subjects) in the medical history were hypertension (18.5%), osteoarthritis 
(10.5%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (10.2%), depression (9.9%), anxiety (8.6%), drug 
hypersensitivity (8.6%), back pain (8.0%), latent TB (7.7%), obesity (7.7%), seasonal allergy (7.7%), 
intervertebral disc protrusion (7.0%), menopause (7.0%), vitamin D deficiency (6.7%), 
hypothyroidism (6.1%), tonsillitis (6.1%), appendicitis (5.4%), insomnia (5.4%), migraine (5.4%), 
post menopause (5.4%), and osteochondrosis (5.1%). 
Numbers analysed 
Data sets analyzed 
Full Analysis Set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug.  Subjects will be included in the analysis based on the treatment group as randomized.  The FAS 
is used for all efficacy and Baseline analyses. 
The FAS included 313 subjects; 157 in the placebo-group and 156 in the upadacitinib group (one 
randomized subject in the placebo group discontinued without receiving study drug, see table under 
heading “Participant flow”).  
Per Protocol Analysis Set 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set represents a subset of the FAS and consists of all FAS subjects who did 
not have any major protocol violations that impact primary efficacy analysis.  The primary endpoint is 
analyzed in the Per Protocol Analysis Set as a sensitivity analysis.  The Per Protocol Analysis Set is 
determined prior to the primary analysis database lock. 
The number of subjects excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set were: 24 in the placebo group and 
21 in the Upadacitinib group. 
Safety Analysis Set 
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually 
received, regardless of the treatment randomized.  Subjects who received at least one dose of 
upadacitinib in the Double-Blind Period are considered to be in the upadacitinib group for safety 
analysis. 
The number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set was identical to the number in the Full Analysis Set 
i.e. 157 in the placebo group and 156 in the upadacitinib group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
A statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved the primary endpoint of ASAS40 at 
Week 14 in the upadacitinib group (44.9%) compared with the placebo group (22.5%), resulting in a 
placebo adjusted difference of 22.2% (P < 0.0001) using non-responder imputation (NRI) 
incorporating multiple imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-MI), please see 
below table.

Table 9: Primary Endpoint:  Analysis of ASAS40 Response Rate at Week 14 (NRI-MI; Full Analysis Set) 
According to the CSR, results from sensitivity analysis using NRI, supplementary analyses using as 
observed (AO), AO-NRI, AO-MI, and the Per Protocol Analysis (NRI-MI) were consistent with the 
primary NRI-MI analysis.  Results from the tipping point analysis were consistent with the primary 
analysis and demonstrated that the primary analysis is robust to the missing not at random (MNAR) 
assumption.   
To facilitate the interpretation of the primary analysis using NRI-MI, a breakdown of the ASAS40 
response at Week 14 by intercurrent events and missing data was provided, se below table.

According to the MAH, most of the subgroup covariates were not stratification factors at randomization 
and have imbalances in demographic and clinically relevant baseline characteristics between the 
treatment groups within each subgroup.  To account for the confounding effects of these imbalances, 
logistic regression for ASAS40 response at Week 14 was conducted adjusting for the most influential 
baseline factors (sex, BMI, and HLA-B27 status, identified by logistic regression with stepwise 
selection).  According to the MAH, the re-analysis showed consistent treatment effects in all subgroups 
in favour of upadacitinib vs placebo (data not shown). 
ASAS40 Time Course Weeks 1 – 14 
A figure of ASAS40 Time Course Weeks 1 – 14 was provided (see below) along with a statement that 
higher proportion of subjects in the upadacitinib group consistently achieved ASAS40 compared with 
the placebo group from Week 2 onwards.

The above table does not include the outcome of ASAS40 response at Week 52 that was included last 
in the testing sequence for EU/ EMA. As stated above, the submitted CSR only presents efficacy data 
up to Week 14. 
According to the CSR, for the multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints, results from the 
corresponding sensitivity and/or supplementary analyses were consistent with the primary analyses. 
Results from the tipping point analyses were consistent with that of the primary analyses and in 
general are robust to the MNAR assumption.   
Other endpoints  
The outcome of additional endpoints was also included in the CSR. These data included change from 
Baseline in MRI SPARCC score of the spine at Week 14, ASAS components, ASAS20 Response Rate and 
ASAS Partial Remission Rate by visit and ASDAS (CRP) Components. Also the outcome of ASDAS LDA, 
ASDAS Clinically Important Improvement, and ASDAS Major Improvement over time, BASDAI 50 
Response Rate, Change from Baseline in Measures of Inflammation and Change from Baseline in 
Measures of Pain by Visit, Patient-Reported Outcomes over time, number of tender joint and number of 
swollen joints at week 14 and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity NRS were 
reported/commented on.

According to the CSR, there was a greater improvement in the number of tender joints in favour of 
upadacitinib vs placebo based on change from Baseline in TJC68 at Week 14 (-4.2 in the upadacitinib 
group and -2.7 in the placebo group) (nominal P = 0.0178). Further, there was a greater improvement 
in the number of swollen joints in favour of upadacitinib vs placebo based on change from Baseline in 
SJC66 at Week 14 (-1.7 in the upadacitinib group and -1.1 in the placebo group) (nominal P = 
0.0028).

Notes 
a. n is calculated by N and MI-aggregated response rate (%). 
b. Construction of CIs for response rate is based on MI inference.  The 
response rate and standard error (SE) are estimated within each imputed 
'complete' dataset, then Rubin's rule is used to combine the response rate 
and SE estimates from 30 imputed 'complete' datasets to get aggregated 
rate and CIs. 
c. Treatment difference, associated CI and P-value for test of difference 
between upadacitinib group and placebo group is constructed based on the 
MI inference.  Risk difference and SE is estimated using Cochran-Mantel- 
Haenszel (CMH) test and screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
screening high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) status as stratification 
factor within each imputed 'complete' dataset, then Rubin's rule is used to  
combine the results from 30 imputed 'complete' datasets to get aggregated 
treatment difference, associated confidence interval, and P-value. 
NRI-MI is non-responder imputation incorporating multiple imputation to 
handle missing data due to

Clinical studies in special populations 
The pivotal clinical study included only 9 subjects who were ≥65 years: 6 in the PBO-group and 3 in the 
upadacitinib group. 
Supportive study 
Long-term efficacy data (data beyond week 14) 
According to the Clinical Overview (p.37), in addition to the 14-week efficacy results from Study M19-
944 Study 2 (nr-axSpA), accumulated 2-year efficacy data from Study M16-098 (SELECT-AXIS 1) of 
the related AS population showed that the benefits of upadacitinib in improving clinical responses, 
pain, function, quality of life, and inflammation can be maintained for the long-term.  Non-radiographic 
axSpA and AS are part of the same spectrum of axial SpA and share common epidemiological, genetic, 
and clinical disease characteristics, including similar disease burden, similar response to treatment, 
and common treatment guidelines. Thus, the 2-year long-term efficacy data from Study M16-098 in 
bDMARD-naïve AS patients can be used as supplementary information to support the long-term benefit 
of upadacitinib in the treatment of patients with active nr-axSpA. 
Study M16-098 was the pivotal study supporting approval of the AS indication for upadacitinib (please 
refer to EPAR for EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005 and approved SmPC). The study design is depicted in the 
below figure from the EPAR.

The MAH considers that improvement in AS in subjects who received upadacitinib 15 mg QD in both 
study periods was maintained from Week 14 to Week 104 on all measures of clinical response and that 
subjects who switched from placebo in the placebo-controlled period to upadacitinib at Week 14 
improved rapidly and maintained response through Week 104, see below table.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The JAK-inhibitor upadacitinib was recently approved for the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) indication 
(EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005) based on data from study M16-098 (SELECT-AXIS 1) which was 
conducted in AS bDMARD-naïve subjects. The current procedure aims to extend the indication to 
subjects with another type of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), namely the less advanced form without 
presence of sacroiliitis on plain conventional radiographs (as defined by the modified New York criteria, 
required to fulfil the diagnosis for AS).  
The MAH submitted the following indication proposal: “RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr axSpA) in adult patients with objective signs of 
inflammation who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).”  
The proposed posology was, similar to AS (and also rheumatoid arthritis-RA, psoriatic arthritis-PsA), 
15 mg once daily. 
The support for the efficacy of upadacitinib for the new indication nr-axSpA is primarily derived from 
the pivotal study M19-944, study 2 in nr-axSpA. Supportive data, on maintenance of effect, is claimed 
from study M16-098 in the related condition i.e. AS. 
No dedicated dose response study was conducted for the new applied indication. Specific dose 
response studies should, in line with the EMA axSpA GL (Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of 
Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis, EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 
1*) be performed in patients with axial SpA.  In this case, dose selection is, according to the MAH, 
informed by results from the exposure-response analyses using data from study M19-944 Study 2 in 
nr-axSpA but also results from the exposure-response analyses conducted based on data from 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 53/104 
 
 
 
 
 
upadacitinib Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in RA. The possible uncertainty pertaining to whether optimal 
daily dose has been identified for nr-axSpA has not been pursued by the CHMP. The MAH’s approach 
was considered acceptable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Pivotal study M19-944, study 2 in nr-axSpA 
Overall design 
Study M19-944 utilizes a "master protocol" that includes 2 independent studies for subjects with active 
axSpA:  Study 1 in biologic DMARD-inadequate responders (bDMARD-IRs) AS and Study 2 in nr-
axSpA.  The latter study is the pivotal study for the current application. The approach was agreed to in 
previous CHMP Advice (EMEA/H/SA/3190/8/2019/II). 
Study 2 includes a 52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period 
followed by a 52-week open-label, long-term extension (OLE) period. The primary endpoint for efficacy 
is analysed at week 14. The study is still on-going and the MAH submitted Clinical Study Report (CSR) 
with efficacy data up to Week 14.  Safety data and subject disposition are presented up to the cut-off 
date (26 August 2021). The approach to submit the variation based on primarily week 14 efficacy data 
and submit efficacy-data from the beyond the week 14 timepoint post-approval was overall accepted in 
the previous CHMP Advice in which it was stated: “The MAH proposes an interim database lock of the 
14 week data, to support submission of the nr-axSpA indication following an AS indication. This may 
be acceptable on the understanding that one year data and two year data are submitted post-
approval, and given that there are no limiting uncertainties regarding maintenance of efficacy and of 
safety for AS and nr-AxSpA.” 
A placebo-controlled parallel group design is, according to EMA axSpA GL acceptable for trials in 
axSpA, both for those including subjects with insufficient response to NSAIDs and those including 
subjects with insufficient response to biological medicinal products. However, according to the EMA GL, 
products belonging to new therapeutic classes may need also comparison against an accepted active 
comparator (e.g. anti TNF treatments) for the target population, in order to properly assess the 
relative benefit risk balance of the new product. In the current case, information on comparative 
efficacy could be extrapolated from data originating from the development programme of related 
conditions e.g. PsA. It is noted that the PsA development programme included one active-controlled 
study in which upadacitinib was compared against adalimumab (please refer to EPAR for 
EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0004 for details). With the totality of data at hand, the CHMP decided that the 
issue of efficacy relative an active comparator for the nr-axSpA indication will not be further pursued. 
The 52-week OLE will be followed by an open-label Remission-Withdrawal Period for which subjects 
with sufficiently low disease activity are eligible. The importance of this was discussed already in the 
procedure leading to the AS approval (please refer to EPAR for EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005 for details).  
Study population 
Study 2 includes subjects with nr-axSpA diagnosis, who do not meet the radiologic criterion for AS, 
which are NSAID-inadequate responders/cannot tolerate NSAIDs which may or may not have previous 
exposure to bDMARDs. Objective signs of active inflammation on MRI of SI joints or hsCRP > ULN at 
Screening are required. Further, active disease as reflected by BASDAI score ≥ 4 and a Patient's 
Assessment of Total Back Pain score ≥ 4 based on a 0 – 10 NRS at Baseline is mandatory. 
Randomization is stratified by MRI and screening hsCRP status and exposure to bDMARDs.   
Overall, the study population expected to be captured with the eligibility criteria is in line with 
comments in previous CHMP Advice and EMA axSpA GL. As underlined in GL, traditional non-biological 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 54/104 
 
 
 
disease modifying antirheumatic drugs have limited value for the treatment of the spinal involvement 
in patients with SpA. Thus, it is supported that csDMARD is allowed in the study if in stable dose but 
that there are no requirements for such treatment.  Further, while the eligibility criteria do not specify 
a minimum duration of active disease before study inclusion, the fact that subjects have inadequate 
response to at least two NSAIDs over a period of at least 4 weeks prior to screening mean that there is 
still a requirement for  a minimum time with active disease. The approach is considered to comply with 
the EMA guideline. On the contrary, the fact that physical therapy is not required prior to study entry is 
considered a limitation. However, this issue was not further pursued. 
During the evaluation, the CHMP requested the MAH to specify the objective signs of inflammation in 
the indication wording. The MAH submitted an updated SmPC in which the indication statement has 
been revised as requested: 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adult 
patients with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
With the current criteria, the CHMP considered that the study population would overall be expected to 
be consistent with the revised indication. 
Endpoints and estimand 
The primary endpoint for Study 2 is the proportion of subjects with ASAS40 response at Week 14. This 
is in line with the relevant EMA axSpA GL and was also agreed in the CHMP Advice.  
As per the relevant EMA GL, the goals of therapy for axSpA includes improvement of symptoms and 
signs such as pain and stiffness, improvement of physical function and slowing or prevention of 
structural damage with acceptable endpoints including ASAS response criteria, ASDAS, BASDAI, 
assessments of spinal mobility e.g the composite BASMI, PROs e.g. ASQoL, acute phase reactants, 
assessment of peripheral joints and entheseal involvement. This is considered adequately well 
reflected in the selection of primary and secondary endpoints in the main study. According to the EMA 
GL, prevention of structural damage is considered a relevant endpoint to be assessed but not a 
requirement for approval and further, SPARCC is acceptable for measurement of MRI changes. 
The primary efficacy analysis uses the composite estimand framework. This is overall in line with 
comments in the CHMP Advice. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods applied were largely acceptable and in line with the scientific advice given by 
the CHMP. The primary composite estimand, sensitivity analysis and the supplementary treatment 
policy estimand, analyses of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints, as well as the handling of 
missing data due to COVID-19, were all agreed to by the CHMP prior to submission of the MAA.  
The stepwise multiple testing procedure provides strong control of the type I error rate at 0.05 alpha 
(2-sided) across analyses of the primary endpoint and 15 secondary endpoints. The primary and the 
multiplicity controlled secondary endpoints (except for the last endpoint in the testing sequence) were 
observed at Week 14. The efficacy analysis up to Week 14, which is presented in this report, is the first 
set of 3 planned analyses. However, no multiplicity adjustment is necessary due to repeated analyses, 
since all subjects had completed the Week 14 visit or had discontinued the study prior to Week 14. The 
data cutoff date for the report is 26 August 2021. 
The efficacy analysis up to Week 52 in the double-blind study period will be reported when data 
becomes available. However, with the present report of positive treatment outcome at Week 14 it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 55/104 
 
 
 
reasonable to assume that patient retention in the placebo group might be lower for the remaining part 
of the study period, which may have negative impact on quality of Week 52 data.  
The primary and first 12 secondary endpoints were statistically significant, which implies that the last 
ranked endpoint ASAS40 at Week 52 (for EU/EMA) which will be tested at the Week 52 database lock, 
will give nominal p-value. Several updates of the SAP were made during the course of the study, 
mainly to align with the new protocol versions. The major statistical changes included addition of the 
remission-withdrawal period and methods for handling missing data due to COVID-19 and regulatory 
feedback, but also change in order of the multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints. The rationale for 
switching the order in the multiple testing procedure was ”emerging external literature data and 
clinical relevance”, as explained in the Protocol Appendix E. The effective SAP version 4.0 was finalized 
prior to the Week 14 database lock.  
No interim efficacy analysis for early stopping was planned. An independent external Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) was used to regularly review unblinded safety data, and when needed, also had 
right to request high-level unblinded efficacy data.  
Participant flow, recruitment and conduct of the study 
In total 314 subjects were randomized; 158 in the placebo group and 156 in the upadacitinib group. 
One subject in the placebo group decided not to participate after randomization and discontinued the 
study before receiving study drug, thus 313 subjects were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) used 
for all efficacy analyses. Further, a total of 145 subjects (92.9%) in the upadacitinib group and 150 
subjects (95.5%) in the placebo group in the FAS completed study drug up to Week 14 (i.e. the 
timepoint for the analysis of the primary endpoint). Further, 149/157 (94.3%) of the subjects in the 
FAS in placebo group and 142/156 (91.0%) in the upadacitinib group completed study up to that 
timepoint. The most frequent primary reason for discontinuation of study drug up to week 14 was AE 
in the upadacitinib group and lack of efficacy in the placebo group. 
The drop-out rate up to week 14 is acceptable in total number and distribution between the groups. As 
commented above, the primary efficacy analysis will use the composite estimand framework. 
Corresponding to this estimand, in the primary analysis, subjects who discontinue study drug prior to 
Week 14 will be treated as non-responders. 
The last subject last visit occurred 02 September 2021 (Week 14) while the cut-off date for the CSR is 
stated to be 26 August 2021. The MAH clarified that it was due to rescheduling of 1 subject and this 
was considered acceptable to the CHMP.  
Substantial amendments were made during the course of this pivotal confirmatory study. The 
amendments included changes to the eligibility criteria and multiplicity-adjusted endpoints including 
the order of these endpoints. The majority of the subjects were enrolled under Global Protocol Version 
3.0 and after that, the changes to the eligibility criteria do not seem substantial and further seem to 
constitute clarifications rather than complete revisions meaning that the population included in the 
study is probably not too heterogenous. Throughout the study, changes to study endpoints and 
statistics were conducted. The MAH has confirmed that changes to eligibility criteria and multiplicity-
adjusted endpoints in the protocol version (amendments) for M19-944 Study 2 were not influenced by 
unblinded data from this study.   
A rather high number of subjects had at least one protocol deviation (21.7%) and eligibility criteria not 
met seemed to be an important reason (16.9% of subjects). The 5 most frequent protocol deviation 
categories related to eligibility criteria not met were presented in a tabulated form. From this 
presentation follows that the most frequent “Eligibility Criteria Not Met” was “BASDAI score ≥ 4 and 
Total Back Pain score ≥ 4 requirement at Screening and BL Visits” (n=14; 8 PBO, 6 upa) while the 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 56/104 
 
 
 
second most common was “Exposure to at most one bDMARD was permitted” (n=12; 7 PBO, 5 upa). 
The remaining 3 of the most frequent protocol deviation categories related to eligibility criteria not 
met, were related to safety criteria. It is agreed with the MAH that the occurrence of these deviations 
should not have a significant impact on the ability to generalize the study results to the (currently) 
proposed indication. 
The MAH pointed out that the pre-specified sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint in the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set, which excludes subjects with relevant protocol deviations (M19-944 Study 2 
CSR), showed consistent results with the primary analysis. Further, the MAH put forward that 
additional post-hoc analyses were performed for the multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints in the 
Per Protocol Analysis Set, and the results of those analyses are consistent with the primary analysis of 
the multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints. This was generally agreed by CHMP.  
Study M16-098 in AS (supportive data) 
Study M16-098 was the pivotal study supporting approval of the AS indication for upadacitinib (please 
refer to EPAR for EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005 and SmPC). In this procedure, efficacy data up to week 
64 was already provided.  
The current approach to submit the variation based on primarily week 14 efficacy data and submit 
efficacy-data from the beyond the week 14 timepoint post-approval was essentially already accepted in 
the previous CHMP Advice (see above reference). However, as indicated in the EMA GL, although 
efficacy may be demonstrated in 12-24 weeks trial, maintenance of the effect in longer trials (e.g. ≥1 
year) should be demonstrated. Considering that efficacy data up to week 64 was already provided in 
Study M16-098 (EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005) and the fact that it is reasonable to extrapolate long-term 
efficacy between the conditions due to the similarities in disease characteristics, it was considered that 
overall sufficient data to support the new indication was available.  
The long-term data from Study M16-098, which may provide further support of long-term benefit, is 
currently being assessed in the parallel variation EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this 
variation for the complete assessment of those data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal study M19-944, study 2 in nr-axSpA 
Baseline data 
Baseline data on general demographics and disease characteristics were overall similar in the two 
treatment groups and the included population is also generally representative for the population 
covered by the indication. Further, the proposed section 5.1 of the SmPC wording on baseline 
characteristics is acceptable in relation to the data available. 
In both treatment groups somewhat more females than males are included; 58.5% females in total. In 
a population of AS a male predominance would have been expected but it is known that for nr-axSpA 
the sex distribution is more even. In the light of this, these baseline findings are not considered to 
have a negative impact on the generalisability of the study results.  
All subjects had prior NSAID use and 98.4% of them at least 2 prior NSAID use (which was stipulated 
by eligibility criteria). Further, it is noted that 49 subjects (31.4%) in the upadacitinib group and 54 
subjects (34.4%) in the placebo group had prior exposure to at least 1 bDMARD.  Among the subjects 
with prior bDMARD exposure, a total of 44 and 43 subjects were exposed to at least 1 TNFi in the 
upadacitinib and placebo groups, respectively.

Subjects had moderately to severely active disease, as indicated by mean BASDAI of 6.86 (Mild 1-3, 
Moderate 4-7 and Severe 8-10). High-sensitivity CRP > ULN was reported for 79.6% of subjects at 
screening and MRI inflammation status at Screening was positive for 43.5% of subjects. At baseline, 
patients had symptoms of non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis for an average of 9.1 years. 
Outcome of the primary endpoint: ASAS40 at week 14 
The study met its primary endpoint as a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects 
achieved ASAS40 at Week 14 in the upadacitinib group (44.9%, 70/156) compared with the placebo 
group (22.5%, 35/157), resulting in a placebo adjusted difference of 22.2% (P < 0.0001) using non-
responder imputation (NRI) incorporating multiple imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to 
COVID-19 (NRI-MI). From the breakdown of the ASAS40 response at Week 14 by intercurrent events 
and missing data provided, it is apparent that the vast majority of non-responders in both treatment 
groups were non-responders based on observed measurements.  As a minor clarification, the MAH was 
requested to explain why the proportion of responders in the CSR and SmPC in the placebo group is 
reported to be 22.5% as 35/157=22.3%. In response to the RSI, it was clarified that this relates to 
the analysis approached used and the approach is considered acceptable. 
For ASAS40, numerical difference between treatment groups was observed at all timepoints from week 
2 to week 14. This has been included in the SmPC.  
Regarding the outcome in subgroups, across subgroups based on age, sex, BMI, race, region, hsCRP 
level at screening, prior bDMARD Exposure, duration of nr-axSpA Symptoms, MRI (SI joints) 
inflammation at screening, MRI inflammation/hsCRP level at screening, there was a numerical 
difference between treatment groups favouring upadacitinib treatment although effect size and 95% CI 
was fluctuating (NRI-MI, FAS). But for the subgroup of subjects with duration since nr-axSpA 
diagnosis>10 years (n=16 in the placebo group and 20 in the upadacitinib group), the response rate 
difference was -3.8% i.e. in favour of placebo. This finding is of some interest, as it can be speculated 
that it would reflect some kind of “window of opportunity” for upadacitinib early in the course of the 
disease. However, as it is based on data from a rather small group of patients, as duration since nr-
axSpA diagnosis was not a stratification factor in the study, the CHMP concluded that it does not 
(without having been replicated) merit inclusion in the product information. 
It is further noted that the response rate difference vs placebo was highest in the stratum which was 
both MRI and hsCRP+ as compared to being positive for one of the factors. For the MRI+/hsCRP>ULN 
stratum, the response rate difference was 43.6% as compared to 11.6% in the MRI+/hsCRP<=ULN 
stratum and 17.1% in the MRI-/hsCRP>ULN stratum (the largest of the three strata). Further, the 
response rate difference was higher in subjects without previous bDMARD exposure as compared to 
subjects with such experience: 28.6% vs 8.7%. 
Overall, the proposed subgroup statement in the product information i.e. “The efficacy of upadacitinib 
15 mg was demonstrated across subgroups including gender, baseline BMI, symptom duration of non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, baseline hsCRP, MRI sacroiliitis, and prior use of bDMARDs.” was 
considered acceptable. 
Outcome of Multiplicity-adjusted secondary endpoints and additional, other endpoints 
Statistical significance was achieved in the first 12 of the 14 presented multiplicity-controlled 
secondary endpoints for upadacitinib compared with placebo. The presentation did not include the 
outcome of ASAS40 response at Week 52 that is placed last in the testing sequence for EU/ EMA. As 
stated above, the submitted CSR only presents efficacy data up to Week 14. 
The endpoints for which statistical significance was achieved thus included:  ASAS40 at Week 14 (the 
primary endpoint), Change from Baseline in ASDAS (CRP) at week 14, Change from Baseline in MRI

SPARCC) score (SI joints) at week 14, BASDAI) 50 response at week 14, ASDAS (CRP) Inactive 
Disease (ID) (ASDAS score < 1.3) at week 14, Change from Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Total 
Back Pain NRS (Score 0 – 10) at week 14, Change from Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Nocturnal 
Back Pain NRS (Score 0 – 10) at week 14, ASDAS (CRP) Low Disease Activity (LDA) (ASDAS score < 
2.1) at week 14, ASAS partial remission (PR) (an absolute score of ≤ 2 units for each of the 4 domains 
identified in ASAS40) at week 14, Change from Baseline in BASFI at week 14, Change from Baseline in 
ASQoL at week 14, Change from Baseline in ASAS Health Index at week 14 and ASAS20 response at 
week 14. 
Statistical significance was not met for: Change from Baseline in BASMIlin at week 14 and Change 
from Baseline in MASES for subjects with baseline Enthesitis (MASES > 0) at week 14. Consequently, 
neither will the endpoint included last in the testing sequence i.e. ASAS40 response at Week 52 be 
able to achieve statistical significance. 
The results indicate some effect also on tender and swollen joint count and hsCRP although these 
outcome measures were not included among the multiplicity-adjusted secondary endpoints precluding 
firm conclusions. Regarding the components of the primary endpoint i.e. ASAS, numerical differences 
in favour of the active arm were noted for all the components when compared with placebo.  
Overall, the outcome of the study indicates that 14-week treatment with upadacitinib have an effect on 
symptoms and signs of nr axSpA (as measured by e.g. ASAS40, ASAS20, ASDAS [CRP]) physical 
function (as measured by BASFI) and other patient-reported outcomes (as measured by ASQoL, ASAS 
Health Index ). Further, upadacitinib has an effect on typical MRI-findings indicative of inflammation 
attributed to the target disease.  
Judging from the outcome on the primary endpoint i.e. ASAS40 at week 14, although the limitations of 
comparisons between trials are acknowledged, the effect size appears similar as the effect size of 
upadacitinib in the treatment of AS (difference from placebo 22.5% for nr-axSpA and, according to the 
approved SmPC, 26.1% for AS).   
Efficacy data in elderly 
Available efficacy data was not reported separately for patients aged 65-74, 75-85 and 85 and older. 
However, the pivotal clinical study included only 9 subjects who were ≥65 years: 6 in the PBO-group 
and 3 in the upadacitinib group. No meaningful information is expected to be yielded by presenting 
efficacy data in this subgroup separately and even less by presenting data split into further age 
subcategories. Thus, the issue was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Study M16-098 in AS (supportive data) 
Study M16-098 was the pivotal study supporting approval of the AS indication for upadacitinib 
(EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005) and, in this procedure, efficacy data up to week 64 was already provided 
as reflected by the following statement in the approved SmPC: 
“In SELECT-AXIS 1, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg 
achieved an ASAS40 response compared to placebo at week 14 (Table 10). A numerical difference 
between treatment groups was observed at week 2 and response was maintained through week 64” 
Thus, although the additional data that is to be assessed in EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G will provide 
further information on the efficacy in axSpA up to 2 years, maintenance of ASAS40 response for at 
least 1 year has already been demonstrated. 
In conclusion, as it is considered reasonable to extrapolate long-term efficacy from AS to nr-axSpA due 
to the similarities in disease characteristics, the CHMP agreed that the M16-098 1-year data supports a 
maintained treatment effect of upadacitinib in subjects with nr-axSpA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 59/104 
 
 
 
As the conclusions on long-term efficacy in nr-axSpA are based on extrapolation between the 
conditions, the statement in Section 4.2 of the SmPC on when to consider discontinuing treatment was 
updated to include nr-axSpA at the CHMP’s request: “Consideration should be given to discontinuing 
treatment in patients with axial spondyloarthritis who have shown no clinical response after 16 weeks 
of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued 
treatment beyond 16 weeks.” 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal, confirmatory study in nr-axSpA met its primary endpoint and the first 12 of the 14 
presented multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints. Overall, the outcome of the study indicates that 
14-week treatment with upadacitinib has an effect on symptoms and signs of nr axSpA (as measured 
by e.g. ASAS40, ASAS20, ASDAS [CRP]) physical function (as measured by BASFI) and other patient-
reported outcomes (as measured by ASQoL, ASAS Health Index). Further, upadacitinib has an effect 
on typical MRI-findings indicative of inflammation.  
Judging from the outcome on the primary endpoint i.e. ASAS40 at week 14, the effect size appears 
similar as the effect size of upadacitinib in the treatment of AS.  The effect size is considered clinically 
relevant. 
The current submission does not include any efficacy data from the pivotal nr-axSpA study beyond 14 
weeks. Instead, maintenance of effect is supported by extrapolation from long-term data from study 
M16-098 that was the pivotal study supporting approval of upadacitinib in a related condition i.e. AS 
(EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005). In the AS procedure efficacy data up to week 64 was already assessed 
as reflected in the approved SmPC. Thus, the maintenance of ASAS40 response for at least 1 year in 
AS has already been demonstrated and the CHMP considered that it was acceptable to extrapolate 
long-term efficacy from AS to nr-axSpA due to the similarities in disease characteristics. The CHMP 
therefore agreed that the M16-098 1-year data supports a maintained treatment effect of upadacitinib 
in subjects with nr-axSpA. Additional M16-098-data up to 2 years is currently assessed in the separate 
on-going procedure EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this variation for the complete 
assessment of those data. 
The CHMP concluded that the data supported the following extension of indication with a dosage of 15 
mg once daily: 
“Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adult 
patients with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).” 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile for Rinvoq includes infections, neutropenia, anaemia, increased liver enzymes, 
increased CPK and lipid derangements.

Common adverse events 
Up to Week 14, the most frequently reported (≥ 5% of subjects) TEAEs by MedDRA system organ 
classes (SOC) in the upadacitinib group were Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal Disorders, 
Nervous System Disorders, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders, Investigations, and Skin 
and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders. 
The most frequently reported (≥ 2% of subjects) TEAEs by PT in the upadacitinib group were 
headache, COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and neutropenia. In the 
placebo group, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were COVID-19, 
nasopharyngitis, oral herpes, headache, abdominal pain upper, pain in extremity, and upper 
respiratory tract infection (Table 18).  Higher frequencies were observed for the upadacitinib group 
compared with the placebo group for headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and neutropenia.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Up to Week 14, SAEs were reported in 6 subjects: 4 subjects (2.6%) in the upadacitinib group and 2 
subjects (1.3%) in the placebo group (Table 16). COVID-19 pneumonia, pyelonephritis, foot fracture, 
and osteoarthritis were each reported in 1 subject in the upadacitinib group, and pancreatitis and 
haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were each reported in 1 subject in the placebo group. 
Up to Week 52, 4 additional SAEs were reported in 4 subjects in the placebo group: meniscus injury, 
femur fracture, cataract, and acute pancreatitis. Two additional SAEs were reported in the upadacitinib 
group: nasal polyps and ureterolithiasis were reported in 1 subject each. Up to Week 52, the EAER of 
SAEs was similar in both treatment groups: 5.7 E/100 PYs in the upadacitinib group and 5.4 E/100 PYs 
in the placebo group. No new SAEs were reported beyond the double-blind period (i.e., after Week 
52). 
There were no deaths up to the current data cut-off. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest were identified based on safety concerns reported for other Janus 
kinase (JAK) inhibitor products, as well as upadacitinib data from preclinical studies and the RA 
development program, and customary regulatory concerns for novel small molecule drugs. 
Up to Week 14, events were reported in the AESI categories listed in Table 19. A notably higher 
proportion of subjects in the upadacitinib group reported neutropenia compared with the placebo 
group. No events were reported in the AESI categories of opportunistic infection, lymphoma, 
adjudicated gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, renal dysfunction, active TB, adjudicated MACE, or 
adjudicated VTE in the upadacitinib group up to Week 14 (Table 19).

** VTE include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (fatal and non-fatal). 
Serious infections 
Up to Week 14, 2 subjects (1.3%) in the upadacitinib group and 1 subject (0.6%) in the placebo group 
had a treatment-emergent serious infection. Serious infections were reported in 1 subject each and

included COVID-19 pneumonia and pyelonephritis in the upadacitinib group and hemorrhagic fever 
with renal syndrome in the placebo group. Up to Week 52, there were no additional treatment-
emergent serious infections reported. 
Herpes zoster 
Up to Week 14, 2 subjects (1.3%) in the upadacitinib group, and 1 subject (0.6%) in the placebo 
group had TEAEs of herpes zoster. According to the MAH, no TEAE of herpes zoster was serious, and 
no subjects discontinued study drug as a result of a herpes zoster. Up to Week 52, there were 2 
additional TEAEs of herpes zoster reported in the upadacitinib group, also these reported as mild or 
moderate and limited to one single dermatome. There were no new herpes zoster TEAEs reported after 
the 52-week Double-Blind Period. Through the data cutoff, a total of 4 TEAEs of herpes zoster (3.4 
E/100 PYs) were reported in 4 subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib. 
Malignancy 
Up to Week 14, 1 subject in the placebo group experienced a malignancy (basal cell carcinoma). No 
additional malignancies were reported up to current data cut-off.   
Hepatic disorders 
At Week 14, subjects in the upadacitinib group had a greater mean increase from baseline in ALT and 
AST (ALT:  3.4 U/L; AST:  2.3 U/L) compared with the placebo group (ALT:  -0.3 U/L; AST:  -0.7 U/L). 
Up to Week 14, the proportion of subjects with hepatic disorders was similar in the upadacitinib and 
placebo groups. By Week 52, the EAER of hepatic disorder was higher in the upadacitinib group 
compared with the placebo group. No events led to discontinuation of study drug. No events were 
serious, and all events were mild to moderate in severity.  
Lymphopenia 
At Week 14, subjects in the upadacitinib group had numerically greater mean increases from Baseline 
in lymphocyte count compared with the placebo group (0.132 × 109/L versus 0.026 × 109/L). Three 
Grade 3 lymphocyte count decreases were reported, 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the upadacitinib 
group. Up to Week 52, no TEAEs of lymphopenia were reported. 
Anaemia 
At Week 14, mean changes from Baseline in hemoglobin were -0.7 g/L for the upadacitinib group and -
0.1 g/L for the placebo group. Up to Week 14, anaemia was reported in 1 subject in the upadacitinib 
group only. The event was assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug, 
was considered a mild TEAE, resolved without study drug interruption and did not lead to 
discontinuation of study drug. No additional events of anaemia were reported up to current data cut-
off. 
Neutropenia 
At Week 14, subjects in the upadacitinib group had a numerically greater mean decrease from Baseline 
in neutrophil count versus the placebo group (-0.670 × 109/L vs. -0.156× 109/L. Up to Week 14, 
5 subjects in the upadacitinib group had TEAEs of neutropenia (none in the placebo group). Of these 
TEAEs, 2 were mild, 2 were moderate, and 1 was severe. Study drug was not interrupted except for 
the severe case that occurred on Day 1. Up to Week 52, 4 additional events (9 events cumulatively) of 
neutropenia were reported in subjects treated with upadacitinib. Most events were mild or moderate, 
and no subject discontinued study drug as a result of TEAEs of neutropenia. Two of the neutropenia 
TEAEs in the upadacitinib group were considered severe, and none were considered serious. There

were no new neutropenia events reported since Week 52.  Overall, the cumulative EAER of neutropenia 
events was 7.7 E/100 PYs. 
Thrombotic events 
In Study M19-944 Study 2, by Week 14, no adjudicated VTEs were reported in subjects in either 
treatment group. Up to Week 52, 1 subject in the placebo group had 1 non-fatal event of DVT. Up to 
current cut-off date, there have been no cases of VTE in the upadacitinib group. 
Laboratory findings 
Regarding liver enzymes and haematology, please refer to adverse events of special interest above. 
Lipids 
In Study M19-944 Study 2 (nr-axSpA), up to Week 14, upadacitinib therapy was associated with an 
increase of lipids compared to the placebo group.  At Week 14, the mean changes from Baseline for 
the upadacitinib versus placebo groups were:  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C):  0.191 
mmol/L versus -0.017 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C):  0.253 mmol/L versus 
0.025 mmol/L; total cholesterol (TC):  0.457 mmol/L versus -0.034 mmol/L. In the upadacitinib group, 
LDL increases were observed up to Week 4 and generally stabilized at Week 8 through Week 14. 
However, the ratios of the TC:HDL-C and the LDL-C:HDL-C, used to assess the overall atherogenic 
potential, generally remained unchanged in both groups.  
Creatinine 
At Week 14, subjects in the upadacitinib group had a small mean increase from Baseline in serum 
creatinine compared to a small mean decrease observed in the placebo group (upadacitinib 3.5 µmol/L 
versus placebo -0.2 µmol/L). No ≥ Grade 3 creatinine increases were reported in any subject 
(Study M19-944 Study 2) in the long-term data.  
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
Through the data cutoff, there were no AEs of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation reported. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Up to Week 14, two subjects (1.3%) in the upadacitinib group and three subjects (1.9%) in the 
placebo group reported hypertension. Up to Week 52, five subjects each in the upadacitinib group (4.7 
E/100 PYs) and placebo group (4.5 E/100 PYs) reported hypertension. 
In the Double-Blind Period, up to Week 14, a decrease in body weight (> 7% from Baseline) was 
recorded in 3.2% of subjects in the upadacitinib group and 1.3% of subjects in the placebo group. An 
increase in body weight (>7% from Baseline) was recorded in 2.6% of subjects in the upadacitinib 
group and 1.3% of subjects in the placebo group. Weight gain is a known adverse event for 
upadacitinib. 
Safety in special populations 
According to the MAH, though based on limited data, the subgroup analyses in Study M19-944 did not 
reveal a clinically relevant increased risk of AEs on upadacitinib treatment based on age, sex, BMI, or 
race. An overview of treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 PYs by age is shown below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 68/104 
 
 
 
Table 21. Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 PYs by age – long term safety 
analysis set 
Due to the relatively small sample size (29.1%) of subjects on concomitant csDMARD therapy, the 
MAH states that no conclusions can be made regarding increased risk of AEs when upadacitinib is used 
in combination with csDMARD therapy. Of note, csDMARD therapy is not recommended for the 
treatment of axial symptoms in international treatment guidelines for AS. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
There were no pregnancies reported in the study.  
Cumulatively, there were a total of 97 pregnancies reported in female subjects in both unblinded and 
blinded upadacitinib clinical studies with the majority reported in RA studies. Of the 68 pregnancies 
from unblinded studies in female patients administered upadacitinib, 22 were live births without 
congenital anomalies (all with exposure to upadacitinib occurred during the first 8 weeks of 
pregnancy). According to the MAH, the 15 female subjects with pregnancies resulting in spontaneous 
abortions had various risk factors that may have contributed to the outcome (e.g., age > 35 years of 
age, concomitant MTX use, previous miscarriage). Additionally, there was 1 ectopic pregnancy, 
13 ongoing pregnancies, and 4 lost to follow-up. 
No congenital anomaly or fetal defect was observed in pregnancies with a known outcome. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential for drug-drug interactions between upadacitinib and commonly used concomitant 
medications as well as probe substrates for CYP450 enzymes was characterized in several Phase 1 
studies.  Based on the results of these studies, strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin) reduce 
upadacitinib plasma exposures by approximately half.  Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) 
increase upadacitinib AUC by 75% and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) by 70%. Concomitant 
administration of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, OATP1B inhibitors, MTX, pH modifying medications, or 
statins has no effect on upadacitinib plasma exposures.  Upadacitinib has no clinically relevant effects 
on plasma exposures of MTX, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, statins, or drugs that are substrates for 
metabolism by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP3A. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Up to Week 14, 4 subjects (2.6%) in the upadacitinib group and 2 subjects (1.3%) in the placebo 
group had TEAE(s) leading to discontinuation of study drug (Table 16). In the upadacitinib group, 1

subject withdrew due to nausea and abdominal pain; 2 subjects withdrew due to axial 
spondyloarthritis; and 1 subject withdrew due to rash, headache, and tremor. According to the MAH, 
all events were assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug by 
investigators except one event of axial spondyloarthritis and the events of rash and headache. In the 
placebo group, one subject withdrew due to vomiting, and the other subject withdrew due to axial 
spondyloarthritis (reported term: flare of axial spondyloarthritis). No laboratory AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug were reported. 
Up to Week 52, 2 additional TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported each in the 
upadacitinib group (nasal polyps and malaise) and in the placebo group (axial spondyloarthritis and 
deep vein thrombosis). Up to Week 52, the EAER of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 
8.5 E/100 PYs in the upadacitinib group and 3.6 E/100 PYs in the placebo group. 
Supportive long-term safety data from study M16-098 
In addition to the previously presented data from study M19-944 study 2 (nr-axSpA), accumulated 2-
year safety from the AS bDMARD-naïve Study M16-098 were also submitted as supportive information 
regarding the potential long-term safety of upadacitinib in patients with active nr-axSpA. 
As stated by the MAH, non-radiographic axSpA and AS are part of the same spectrum of axial SpA and 
share common epidemiological, genetic, and clinical disease characteristics, including similar disease 
burden, and common treatment guidelines. Thus, the 2-year long-term safety data from Study M16-
098 in bDMARD-naïve AS patients are proposed to support the long-term benefit of upadacitinib 
patients with active nr-axSpA. The 2-year long-term data from Study M16-098 in bDMARD-naïve AS 
patients are being assessed in the on-going variation II/15G. Please refer to this variation for the 
complete assessment of the data. 
In Study M16-098, the original marketing application for upadacitinib for the treatment of AS included 
safety data from 182 subjects with active AS who received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
representing an exposure of 237.6 patient-years. According to the MAH, no new safety risks were 
identified compared to previous upadacitinib data. In the placebo-controlled period, the number of 
subjects with serious adverse events and AEs leading to discontinuation were comparable between 
placebo and upadacitinib groups, and there were no deaths up to the data cutoff date 
(31 January 2020).  There was no evidence of a higher rate of adverse events of special interest 
compared to those previously reported in the RA population. Laboratory changes observed were 
transient and generally not clinically significant. 
Since the original marketing application based on 1-year data, additional data from Study M16-098 are 
available as of the data cutoff of 26 November 2020. As of this cutoff, 182 subjects had received at 
least 1 dose of upadacitinib with a cumulative exposure of 308.6 PYs. Evaluation of the updated data 
compared to that reported in the initial AS submission indicates similar or numerically lower exposure-
adjusted rates of overall AEs and AESI (Table 22 and Table 23).

No deaths were reported up to the data cutoff for the 2-year report. Overall, SOCs with the highest 
exposure-adjusted event rates were infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, 
investigations, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. At the cutoff date, AEs with 
≥ 3 E/100 PYs that were assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug 
were blood CPK increased, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. Nineteen SAEs (6.2 
E/100 PYs) were reported up to the data cutoff in subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib, one 
of which (CPK increased) was assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study 
drug.  Seventeen events (5.5 E/100 PYs) that led to study drug discontinuation were reported in the 
long-term data. 
No AEs of serious infection, NMSC, lymphoma, adjudicated gastrointestinal perforation, renal 
dysfunction, active TB, or adjudicated MACE were reported in subjects who received upadacitinib. 
AESI that were reported in ≥ 1 subject who received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib are summarized below: 
•  Opportunistic infection was reported in 1 subject who had 2 events (0.6 E/100 PYs) of 
esophageal candidiasis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 72/104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Five AEs of herpes zoster (1.6 E/100 PYs) were reported in 4 subjects.  One subject 
discontinued study drug as a result.  All events were nonserious, mild or moderate in severity, 
and confined to a single dermatome. 
•  One malignancy was reported (0.3 E/100 PYs). The AE of squamous cell carcinoma of the 
tongue was confirmed by biopsy and reported as a stage IVa malignancy (staging T4a N2c 
MO). It was assessed by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to 
study drug.  The 60-year-old subject was a former smoker and had less than 5 months of 
exposure to study drug prior to diagnosis. 
•  One case of adjudicated VTE was reported. The event was adjudicated as a pulmonary 
embolism, led to discontinuation of study drug, and was assessed by the investigator as having 
no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug but to risk factors for thrombosis 
including prior thrombosis of the lower leg, impaired glucose tolerance, cigarette smoking, 
sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. 
• 
The rate of hepatic disorders was 10.4 E/100 PYs. None of the hepatic disorders were serious, 
the majority were mild to moderate, transient asymptomatic transaminase elevations. 
•  All AEs of neutropenia, anemia, and lymphopenia were nonserious AEs, and none led to 
discontinuation of study drug. 
• 
The rate of CPK elevation was 11.3 E/100 PYs in subjects receiving upadacitinib. None of the 
AEs of blood CPK elevation led to study drug discontinuation, and the majority were 
asymptomatic.   
Post marketing experience 
Upadacitinib was first approved for the treatment of RA on 16 August 2019 in USA. Through 31 August 
2021, the estimated cumulative postmarketing exposure is 102,193 patient treatment years.  
The MAH has made a review of postmarketing reports (spontaneous, solicited, literature) received from 
16 August 2019 through 15 September 2021. Search of the MAH’s global safety database retrieved 
51,757 reports. Overall, 89% of the reports were considered nonserious. The most frequently reported 
MedDRA SOC was General disorders and administration site conditions, in which pain, drug ineffective, 
and fatigue had the greatest number of reports with this SOC. Among all the reports, the most 
common AEs reported included rheumatoid arthritis (11%), pain (10%), arthralgia (10%). Indications 
with the most reported AEs were RA (87%) and Unknown (10%). The remaining indications reported 
less than 1% of AEs. 
The most commonly reported SAE was surgery, which accounted for 3% of all SAEs and 0.5% of all 
reports. The remaining SAEs were reported in less than 0.5% of all retrieved reports. Generally, the 
type and pattern of SAEs reported were similar to what has been observed in the clinical trials for 
upadacitinib. 
Most of the postmarketing events were either expected for upadacitinib or commonly seen in the 
general population or patient populations indicated for upadacitinib. Review of the postmarketing 
reports did not identify any new safety risks for the marketed upadacitinib in treating patients with 
active nr-axSpA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 73/104 
 
 
 
The exposure for Rinvoq in the nr-axSpA population is limited, since the current submission includes 
only interim efficacy data up to week 14 (plus additional individual data up to current data cut-off). 
Only 114/187 patients have been exposed for more than 6 months, and 35 patients for more than 12 
months. The final CSR is expected in 2026. Because of this limited exposure, supportive 2-year safety 
data from Study M16-098 in the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drug (bDMARD)-naïve population have also been presented within this submission.  
This approach was supported in previous scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/340675/2019, 
EMEA/H/SA/3190/8/2019/II): “The MAH proposes an interim database lock of the 14-week data, to 
support submission of the nr-axSpA indication following an AS indication. This may be acceptable on 
the understanding that one year data and two year data are submitted post-approval, and given that 
there are no limiting uncertainties regarding maintenance of efficacy and of safety for AS and nr-
AxSpA”. 
Given many well-known similarities between AS and nr-axSpA, this approach is overall considered 
acceptable. This assessment will include a comparison of the safety data from study M19-944 and the 
safety data from study M16-098 in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis in order to identify 
potential new short-term safety concerns in the nr-axSpA population not previously identified in the AS 
population, which could question such an extrapolation approach.  
It needs to be highlighted that there are actually some differences in baseline disease characteristics 
between these two study populations. The most important differences are that patients in the AS 
population are generally older and have a longer disease duration than patients in the nr-axSpA 
population which is expected since nr-axSpA is an earlier stage of AS disease. Further, more patients 
in the nr-axSpA population were treated with concomitant csDMARDs, distributed as follows: 
sulfasalazine 17.3%, methotrexate 8.3%, and leflunomide 2.6%. This might impact the safety; 
however given that no safety concerns are observed in the current study extrapolation from the AS 
population might still be possible. 
Adverse events 
During the placebo-controlled 14-week period, the AEs occurred in 75/156 patients (48.1%) in the 
upadacitinib group and in 72/157 patients (45.9%) in the placebo group. This is lower than what was 
observed during the placebo-controlled 14-week period in the AS population (UPA: 62.4%, PBO: 
55.3%, source: EPAR for variation II/005).  
Also serious adverse events were slightly more frequent in the upadacitinib arm (2.6%) than in the 
placebo arm (1.3%), but the number of events was few. This is in contrast to above slightly higher 
than what was observed for Rinvoq in the AS study (SAE for UPA: 1.1%); however, of the observed 
SAEs in the current study only 2/4 events are suspected to be related to Rinvoq (COVID-19 
pneumonia, pyelonephritis, foot fracture, and osteoarthritis). There were no deaths in either of the 
groups.  
Throughout the total 52-week period, the pattern was similar with a higher frequency of AEs and SAEs 
in the upadacitinib than in the placebo group. The EAIR for AEs and SAEs in long-term data is similar 
(but numerically slightly slower) in the nr-axSpA population compared to the AS population. 
The most common adverse events were infections. Higher frequencies were observed for the 
upadacitinib group compared with the placebo group for headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
and neutropenia. All of these except for diarrhoea is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC; however, the 
difference in occurrence in diarrhoea is based on only one case and is not considered to be relevant. 
The pattern is very similar to the safety profile observed in the AS population, apart from increase in 
liver enzymes for which there was no difference in frequency of hepatic disorder between the 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 74/104 
 
 
 
upadacitinib and placebo arms in the current study. As discussed later in this AR there was a greater 
mean increase from baseline in liver enzymes for the upadacitinib compared to the placebo group 
indicating that there are probably no large differences between the populations.  
Also up to 52 weeks, headache was the most frequent AE in the upadacitinib group, followed by 
COVID-19 and neutropenia. 
Adverse events of special interest 
The most notable difference in occurrence in adverse events of special interest is a higher incidence of 
neutropenia in the upadacitinib group (8.5E/100PYs) than in the placebo group (0.9E/100PYs). 
Neutropenia is a known adverse event for Rinvoq, and there are recommendations for monitoring and 
dose interruption in the SmPC. Also hepatic disorder, serious infection, anaemia, and herpes zoster 
were numerically higher in the upadacitinib group compared with the placebo group. These are all 
known risks and no new safety signals were observed. 
The EAIR for herpes zoster was slightly higher in the nr-axSpA population (4 events, 3.4E/100 PYs) 
than in the AS population (5 events, 2.1E/100PYs). Although a higher frequency of concomitant 
csDMARDs might make these patients more susceptible to herpes, this is likely to be a random finding 
because of the few actual events. Both studies excluded subjects with recurrent or disseminated 
herpes zoster infection. 
There were no malignancies, gastrointestinal perforations, MACE or thrombotic events in the 
upadacitinib arm.  
In the long-term nr-axSpA data, 8 cumulative events of hepatic disorder (6.9 E/100 PYs) were 
reported in 5 upadacitinib-treated subjects. This is lower than what was observed in the AS population 
(10.1 E/100 PYs), despite a higher use of concomitant csDMARDs in the nr-axSpA population which is 
reassuring. 
No relevant differences in anaemia were observed between the nr-axSpA and AS populations. 
Overall, there were no new safety concerns observed with regards to adverse events of special interest 
in this limited nr-axSpA data. 
Laboratory findings 
Up to Week 14, upadacitinib therapy was associated with an increase of lipids compared to the placebo 
group. However, the ratios of the TC:HDL-C and the LDL-C:HDL-C generally remained unchanged in 
both groups. Monitoring recommendations are included in the SmPC, which is appropriate. 
At Week 14, subjects in the upadacitinib group had a small mean increase from baseline in serum 
creatinine compared to a small mean decrease observed in the placebo group, but no ≥ Grade 3 
creatinine increases were reported in the long-term data and overall, no renal safety concerns were 
identified. 
Through the data cutoff, there were no AEs of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation reported. 
Safety in special populations 
According to the MAH, though based on limited data, the subgroup analyses in Study M19-944 did not 
reveal a clinically relevant increased risk of AEs on upadacitinib treatment based on age, sex, BMI, or 
race.  
Due to the relatively small sample size (29.1%) of subjects on concomitant csDMARD therapy, the 
MAH states that no firm conclusions can be made regarding increased risk of AEs when upadacitinib is 
used in combination with csDMARD therapy. In the current study, 27/156 patients (17.3%) of 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 75/104 
 
 
 
upadacitinib-treated patients received concomitant sulfasalazine. The most prominent finding is that 
the frequency of hepatic disorders was higher among patients with concomitant sulfasalazine than 
among patients without any concomitant csDMARD. The MAH argues that this is expected since hepatic 
disorders are known AEs for both agents, and that this is sufficiently covered in the respective 
products’ SmPCs. This is partly agreed on. Although similar information is included in the Rinvoq SmPC 
in the description of the safety profile in patients with RA and PsA with/without concomitant 
methotrexate, the potential difference in the current case is based on very few patients which is a clear 
limitation. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no SmPC updates are warranted. 
Rinvoq is contraindicated during pregnancy and is not recommended during lactation. There were no 
pregnancies reported in the current study. 
Supportive long-term data from patients with ankylosing spondylitis 
The MAH has presented updated data from the AS bDMARD-naïve Study M16-098 to support the long-
term safety of upadacitinib in patients with active nr-axSpA. In the 2-year data from study M16-098, 
there were no deaths and no AEs of serious infection, NMSC, lymphoma, adjudicated gastrointestinal 
perforation, renal dysfunction, active TB, or adjudicated MACE reported in subjects who received 
upadacitinib. It is agreed with the MAH that there are no safety signals in the presented data. The 2 
years full clinical study report from Study M16-098 is currently being assessed in the parallel variation 
EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this variation for the complete assessment of those data. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety signals have been identified in the presented data, and the safety profile of Rinvoq in 
the nr-axSpA population seems consistent with data from previous indications and the safety profile as 
described in the SmPC.  
The main limitation pertains to the limited long-term data, since this application is based on interim 
data up to 14 weeks (plus additional individual data up to current data cut-off). Only 114/187 patients 
have been exposed for more than 6 months, and 35 patients for more than 12 months. However, 
given many similarities between the nr-ax-SpA population the previously approved AS population, the 
CHMP agreed that long-term data from the AS population are considered supportive. The 2 years full 
clinical study report from Study M16-098 is currently being assessed in the parallel variation 
EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this variation for the complete assessment of those data. 
The CHMP concluded that the safety data was supportive of the extension of indication.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
The proposed leaflet content includes updates to sections 1, 2 and 3 to clearly define the broader 
indication statement “Axial spondyloarthritis (including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and 
ankylosing Spondylitis)” to make it clear and understandable to patients.  The extension to the AS 
indication does not change the design formats and layouts (bottle and blister) from the original user 
tested leaflets for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), or subsequent approved bridge reports for the additional 
indications of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/ Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), and Atopic Dermatitis (AD).   
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is represented by a group of diseases that share common genetic, clinical, and 
radiographic features. Adult SpA patients are commonly categorized by the two predominant 
manifestations of disease: axial SpA, which primarily involves the spine and sacroiliac (SI) joints, or 
peripheral SpA, which primarily involves peripheral joints. Further, axial SpA encompasses a spectrum 
of inflammatory conditions involving the axial skeleton with two distinct entities, AS, which requires 
the presence of sacroiliitis on plain conventional radiographs as defined by the modified New York 
criteria and nr-axSpA, which does not meet the 1984 modified New York imaging criteria. Patients with 
nr-axSpA and AS share common epidemiological, genetic, and clinical disease characteristics, including 
disease activity, and similar response to treatment however, presence (AS) or absence (nr-axSpA) of 
radiographic findings serve as an important differentiating characteristic between the two categories of 
axSpA. 
The prevalence of AS differs between regions and has been estimated to be up to 0.5% with similar 
estimated prevalence rates for nr-axSpA, resulting in an overall prevalence for axSpA in the US and in 
the EU of approximately up to 1% or higher. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In 2016, the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) and European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published updated treatment recommendations for axial SpA. The first-
line treatment of axial SpA consists of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  In patients with 
persistently high disease activity despite a course of two NSAIDs given over a total of at least 4 weeks, 
initiation of a bDMARD is recommended, and current practice is to start with a tumour necrosis factor 
alpha inhibitor (TNFi).  If TNFi therapy fails, switching to another TNFi or an interleukin (IL)-17 
inhibitor (IL-17i) is recommended.  
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 97/104 
 
 
 
Overall, available treatment options remain limited, particularly for nr-axSpA as compared to other 
rheumatic diseases such as RA or PsA. In axSpA, conventional synthetic disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and long-term corticosteroids are not efficacious and therefore not 
recommended for treatment of axial symptoms. Once patients have an inadequate response to 
NSAIDs, and more advanced systemic therapies are required, available biologics are administered 
either subcutaneous (SQ) or intravenous. To date, there have been no oral targeted therapies 
approved for the treatment of nr-axSpA. However, upadacitinib was recently approved for the AS 
indication in the EU based on the Phase 2/3 study in AS bDMARD-naïve subjects: Study M16-098, 
SELECT-AXIS 1 (EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005). The aim of the current procedure is to extend the Rinvoq 
indication to nr-axSpA i.e. to include also subjects with the less advanced form without presence of 
sacroiliitis on plain conventional radiographs. 
The MAH submitted the following wording for the new indication: “RINVOQ is indicated for the 
treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adult patients with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).”  
The proposed posology was similar to AS (and also rheumatoid arthritis-RA and psoriatic arthritis-PsA), 
15 mg once daily. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The support for the efficacy of upadacitinib for the new indication nr-axSpA is primarily derived from 
the pivotal study M19-944 in nr-axSpA. Supportive data is claimed from study M16-098 in the related 
condition i.e. bDMARD-naïve AS. 
Study M19-944 Study 2 (nr-axSpA) is an ongoing multicenter study with an overall design as outlined 
in the lower part of the figure below. Study M19-944 utilizes a "master protocol" that includes 2 
independent studies for subjects with active axSpA:  biologic DMARD-inadequate responders 
(bDMARD-IRs) AS (Study 1) and nr-axSpA (Study 2). 
AS = ankylosing spondylitis; ASAS = Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society; bDMARD-IR = biologic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs inadequate responder; DB = double-blind; IR = inadequate response; nr-

Figure 9: Study M19-944 Study 2 Design Schematic 
The MAH submitted the complete 14-week results from Study 2 in subjects with active nr-axSpA.  
Efficacy data are presented up to Week 14.  Safety data and subject disposition are presented up to 
the cut-off date (26 August 2021), which includes summaries of all data up to Week 14, summaries of 
available data up to Week 52, as well as summaries of available long-term data up to the cut-off date. 
The approach to submit the variation based on primarily week 14 efficacy data and submit efficacy-
data from the beyond the week 14 timepoint post-approval was overall accepted in the previous CHMP 
Advice. 
The primary endpoint for Study 2 is the proportion of subjects with ASAS40 response at Week 14. This 
is in line with the relevant EMA axSpA GL and was also agreed in the CHMP Advice. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The pivotal, confirmatory study in nr-axSpA met its primary endpoint and the first 12 of the 14 
presented multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints. 
A statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved ASAS40 at Week 14 in the 
upadacitinib group (44.9%, 70/156) compared with the placebo group (22.5%, 35/157), resulting in a 
placebo adjusted difference of 22.2% (P < 0.0001) using non-responder imputation (NRI) 
incorporating multiple imputation (MI) to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-MI).  
The secondary endpoints for which statistical significance was achieved included: Change from 
Baseline in ASDAS (CRP) at week 14, Change from Baseline in MRI SPARCC score (SI joints) at week 
14, BASDAI 50 response at week 14, ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease (ID) (ASDAS score < 1.3) at week 
14, Change from Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain NRS (Score 0 – 10) at week 14, 
Change from Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Nocturnal Back Pain NRS (Score 0 – 10) at week 14, 
ASDAS (CRP) Low Disease Activity (LDA) (ASDAS score < 2.1) at week 14, ASAS partial remission 
(PR) (an absolute score of ≤ 2 units for each of the 4 domains identified in ASAS40) at week 14, 
Change from Baseline in BASFI at week 14, Change from Baseline in ASQoL at week 14, Change from 
Baseline in ASAS Health Index at week 14 and ASAS20 response at week 14. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main limitation is that the current submission does not include any efficacy data from the pivotal 
nr-axSpA study beyond 14 weeks. Instead, maintenance of effect is supported by extrapolation from 
long-term data from study M16-098 that was the pivotal study supporting approval of upadacitinib in a 
related condition i.e. AS (EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005). In the AS procedure efficacy data up to week 64 
was already assessed as reflected in the approved SmPC. Thus, the maintenance of ASAS40 response 
for at least 1 year in AS has already been demonstrated and the CHMP considered that it was 
acceptable to extrapolate long-term efficacy from AS to nr-axSpA due to the similarities in disease 
characteristics. The CHMP therefore agreed that the M16-098 1-year data supports a maintained 
treatment effect of upadacitinib in subjects with nr-axSpA. 
The long-term data from Study M16-098, which may provide further support,  is currently being 
assessed in the parallel variation EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this variation for the 
complete assessment of those data. 
Statistical significance was not met for the following secondary endpoints: Change from Baseline in 
BASMIlin at week 14 and Change from Baseline in MASES for subjects with baseline Enthesitis (MASES 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022

> 0) at week 14. Consequently, neither will the endpoint included last in the testing sequence i.e. 
ASAS40 response at Week 52 be able to achieve statistical significance. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the placebo-controlled 14-week period, AEs occurred in 75/156 patients (48.1%) in the 
upadacitinib group and in 72/157 patients (45.9%) in the placebo group. Also serious adverse events 
were slightly more frequent in the upadacitinib arm (2.6%) than in the placebo arm (1.3%). SAEs 
among upadacitinib-treated subjects were COVID-19 pneumonia, pyelonephritis, foot fracture, and 
osteoarthritis.  
Throughout the total 52-week period, the pattern was similar with a higher frequency of AEs and SAEs 
in the upadacitinib group (AEs: 260 E/100PYs, SAEs: 5.7 E/100PYs) than in the placebo group (AEs: 
228 E/100PYs, SAEs: 5.4 E/100PYs). There were no deaths up to the current data cut-off. 
The most common adverse events were infections. Higher frequencies were observed for the 
upadacitinib group compared with the placebo group for headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
and neutropenia. Also up to 52 weeks, headache was the most frequent AE in the upadacitinib group, 
followed by COVID-19 and neutropenia. 
The most notable difference in occurrence in adverse events of special interest is a higher incidence of 
neutropenia in the upadacitinib group (8.5E/100PYs) than in the placebo group (0.9E/100PYs). Also 
hepatic disorder, serious infection, anaemia, and herpes zoster were numerically higher in the 
upadacitinib group compared with the placebo group. These are all known risks and no new safety 
signals were observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main limitation pertains to the limited long-term exposure in the nr-axSpA population. Only 
114/187 patients have been exposed for more than 6 months, and 35 patients for more than 12 
months. Furthermore, the limited size of the study hampers the possibility to evaluate meaningful 
differences in safety in important subgroups, for example in elderly and in patients treated with 
concomitant csDMARDs. Long-term safety data will be submitted following the completion of study 
M19-944 (category 3 study see 2.6. ). 
Supportive data are gained from study M16-098 in patients with AS, a more advanced form of axial 
spondylarthritis. It was agreed in the previous scientific advice that these data could support long-term 
efficacy and safety in the nr-axSpA population “given that there are no limiting uncertainties regarding 
maintenance of efficacy and of safety for AS and nr-AxSpA”.  The 2 years full clinical study report from 
Study M16-098 is currently being assessed in the parallel variation EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. 
Please refer to this variation for the complete assessment of those data.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The outcome of the study indicates that 14-week treatment with upadacitinib has an effect on 
symptoms and signs of nr axSpA (as measured by e.g. ASAS40, ASAS20, ASDAS [CRP]) physical 
function (as measured by BASFI) and other patient-reported outcomes (as measured by ASQoL, ASAS 
Health Index). Further, upadacitinib has an effect on typical MRI-findings indicative of inflammation.  
Judging from the outcome on the primary endpoint, i.e. ASAS40 at week 14, the effect size appears 
similar as the effect size of upadacitinib in the treatment of AS. The effect size is considered clinically 
relevant. 
The main limitation in the assessment of favourable effects is that the current submission does not 
include any efficacy data from the pivotal nr-axSpA study beyond 14 weeks. Instead, maintenance of 
effect is supported by extrapolation from long-term data from study M16-098 that was the pivotal 
study supporting the approval in AS (EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0005). Maintenance of ASAS40 response 
for at least 1 year in AS has already been demonstrated as reflected in the approved Rinvoq SmPC. 
The CHMP considered it reasonable to extrapolate long-term efficacy from AS to nr-axSpA due to the 
similarities in disease characteristics. Thus, although the limitation in the extent of data is 
acknowledged, the CHMP agreed that the M16-098 1-year data supports a maintained treatment effect 
of upadacitinib in subjects with nr-axSpA.  
The long-term data from Study M16-098, which may provide further support, is currently being 
assessed in the parallel variation EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this variation for the 
complete assessment of those data. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
The observed safety data is consistent with the known safety profile of Rinvoq with predominantly 
infections, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and neutropenia. These are all known risks 
considered to be adequately covered in the current SmPC. Although the short duration of exposure is a 
clear limitation, it is noted that there were no deaths, MACE or malignancies up to current cut-off.  
Long-term safety data will be submitted following the completion of study M19-944 (category 3 study 
see section 2.6.). Meanwhile, long-term data can be extrapolated from the ankylosing spondylitis 
population (study M16-098). In the 2-year data from study M16-098, there were no deaths and no AEs 
of serious infection, NMSC, lymphoma, adjudicated gastrointestinal perforation, renal dysfunction, 
active TB, or adjudicated MACE reported in subjects who received upadacitinib. Therefore, these data 
do not raise any concern on the long-term safety of Rinvoq in patients with axial spondyloarthritis. The 
long-term data from Study M16-098 is currently being assessed in the parallel variation 
EMEA/H/C/004760/II/0015/G. Please refer to this variation for the complete assessment of those data. 
Overall, the safety profile is acceptable; in line with the known safety profile of upadacitinib. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
During the evaluation, the CHMP requested the MAH to specify the objective signs of inflammation in 
the indication wording. The MAH submitted an updated SmPC in which the indication statement has 
been revised as requested: 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adult 
patients with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/659973/2022  
Page 102/104 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, has started a review of the safety of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used 
to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis). Rinvoq is part of the 
products reviewed in the on-going referral. The review of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of 
inflammatory disorders has been initiated at the request of the European Commission (EC) under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The recommendation on the present application is without prejudice to the final conclusions of the 
ongoing referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting from 
pharmacovigilance data. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of RINVOQ is positive in the following indication: 
“Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adult 
patients with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).”

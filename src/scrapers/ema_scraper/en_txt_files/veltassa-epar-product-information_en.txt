CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Veltassa is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The onset of action of Veltassa occurs 4 – 7 hours after administration. It should not replace 
emergency treatment for life threatening hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
Veltassa is administrated once daily. The recommended starting dose of Veltassa varies with age. 
Multiple sachets may be used to achieve the desired dose.  
The daily dose may be adjusted in intervals of one week or longer, based on the serum potassium level 
and the desired target range. Serum potassium should be monitored when clinically indicated (see 
section 4.4). The duration of treatment should be individualized by the treating physician based on the 
need of serum potassium management. If serum potassium falls below the desired range, the dose 
should be reduced or discontinued.

Administration of Veltassa should be separated by 3 hours from other oral medicinal products (see 
section 4.5).  
Adults  
The recommended starting dose is 8.4 g patiromer once daily. The daily dose may be increased or 
decreased by 8.4 g, as necessary to reach the desired target range, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g 
daily. 
Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
The recommended starting dose is 4 g patiromer once daily. Adjust the daily dose of patiromer based 
on the serum potassium level and the desired target range, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g daily. It is 
recommended to switch to 8.4 g patiromer sachets if doses above 7 g are needed.  
Missed doses  
If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. The missed 
dose should not be taken with the next dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No special dose and administration guidelines are recommended for this population. 
Patients on dialysis 
There is limited data on the use of patiromer in patients on dialysis. No special dose and administration 
guidelines were applied to these patients in clinical trials. No paediatric patients receiving dialysis 
have been treated with patiromer. 
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
Patiromer has been studied only in a limited number of patients with estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73 m².  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of patiromer in children aged under 12 years have not yet been established. 
The data in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years are limited to 6 months exposure. Therefore, treatment 
beyond 6 months should be done with caution in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (see section 4.4). 
Method of administration  
Oral use. 
Veltassa should be mixed with water and stirred to a suspension of uniform consistency. The 
recommended total volumes for preparation of the suspension are dose dependent: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
1 g patiromer: 10 mL  
2 g patiromer: 20 mL 
3 g patiromer: 30 mL 
4 g patiromer: 40 mL 
>4 g patiromer: 80 mL 
The suspension should be prepared according to the following steps: 
• 
• 
The first half of the recommended volume for the required dose should be poured into a glass 
and the complete dose of patiromer should be added, then stirred.  
The second half of the recommended volume should be added and the suspension stirred again 
thoroughly.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The powder will not dissolve. More water may be added to the mixture as needed for desired 
consistency. However, larger volumes might lead to an accelerated sedimentation of the powder. 
The mixture should be taken within 1 hour of initial suspension. If powder remains in the glass after 
drinking, more water should be added and the suspension stirred and taken immediately. This may be 
repeated as needed to ensure the entire dose is administered. 
According to personal preferences, following liquids or soft foods can be used instead of water to 
prepare the mixture by following the same steps as described above: apple juice, cranberry juice, 
pineapple juice, orange juice, grape juice, pear juice, apricot nectar, peach nectar, yoghurt, milk, 
thickener (for example: cornstarch), apple sauce, vanilla and chocolate pudding. 
The potassium content of liquids or soft foods used to prepare the mixture should be considered as part 
of the dietary recommendations on potassium intake for each individual patient. 
In general, cranberry juice intake should be limited to moderate amounts (for example less than 
400 mL per day) due to its potential interaction with other medicinal products. 
This medicine can be taken with or without meals. It should not be heated (e.g. microwaved) or added 
to heated foods or liquids. It should not be taken in its dry form. 
Administration by nasogastric (NG) or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube:  
For doses up to 8.4 g patiromer, the suspension should be prepared as described above in the section 
relating to the oral administration. For doses above 8.4 g and up to 16.8 g patiromer a total volume of 
160 mL should be used and for doses above 16.8 g and up to 25.2 g patiromer a total volume of 
240 mL. These volumes ensure that the suspension readily flows through the tubes.  
Compatibility has been shown with tubes made from polyurethane, silicone, and polyvinyl chloride. 
The recommended diameter of the tubes is 2.17 mm (6.5 Fr) or larger. After administration the tube 
should be flushed with water. For instructions on disposal, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Low magnesium 
In clinical trials, serum magnesium values <1.4 mg/dL (0.58 mmol/L) occurred in 9% of adult patients 
treated with patiromer. Mean decreases in serum magnesium were 0.17 mg/dL (0.070 mmol/L) or less. 
In a clinical trial involving paediatric patients, mean decrease in serum magnesium at Week 26 was 
0.35 mg/dL (0.1440 mmol/L). No patients reached serum magnesium <1.4 mg/dL (0.58 mmol/L) 
during the paediatric clinical trial.  
Serum magnesium should be monitored for at least 1 month after initiating treatment and as clinically 
indicated during treatment, and magnesium supplementation considered in patients who develop low 
serum magnesium levels. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Patients with a history of bowel obstruction or major gastrointestinal surgery, severe gastrointestinal 
disorders, or swallowing disorders were not included in the clinical trials. Gastrointestinal ischaemia, 
necrosis and/or intestinal perforation have been reported with other potassium binders. The benefits 
and risks of administering patiromer should be carefully evaluated in adult and paediatric patients with 
current or history of severe gastrointestinal disorders, before and during the treatment. 
Discontinuing patiromer 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When discontinuing patiromer, serum potassium levels may rise, especially if 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor treatment is continued. Patients should be 
instructed not to discontinue therapy without consulting their physicians. Increases in serum potassium 
may occur as early as 2 days after the last patiromer dose. There is limited information on serum 
potassium levels in paediatric patients on patiromer discontinuation. 
Serum potassium levels 
Serum potassium should be monitored as per standard practice when clinically indicated, including 
after changes are made to medicinal products that affect the serum potassium concentration (e.g. 
RAAS inhibitors or diuretics) and after the patiromer dose is titrated or discontinued. 
Limitations of the clinical data 
Severe hyperkalaemia 
There is limited experience in patients with serum potassium concentrations greater than 6.5 mmol/L. 
In the paediatric population, experience is limited to patients with maximum serum potassium 
concentrations of 6.2mmol/L. Veltassa should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-
threatening hyperkalaemia because of its delayed onset of action (see section 4.2). 
Long term exposure 
Clinical trials with patiromer have not included exposure longer than one year. Clinical trials in 
paediatric patients have not included exposure longer than 6 months. Therefore, treatment beyond 
6 months should be done with caution in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
Information about sorbitol 
Veltassa contains sorbitol as part of the counterion complex. The sorbitol content is approximately 4 g 
(10.4 kcal) per 8.4 g of patiromer and approximately 0.5 g (1.2 kcal) per 1 g of patiromer. Patients 
with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. 
Information about calcium 
Veltassa contains calcium as part of the counterion complex. Calcium is partially released, some of 
which may be absorbed (see section 5.1). The benefits and risks of administering this medicinal 
product should be carefully evaluated in adult and paediatric patients at risk of hypercalcaemia. Serum 
calcium should be monitored for at least 1 month after initiating treatment and as clinically indicated 
during treatment.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of patiromer on other medicinal products 
Patiromer has the potential to bind some oral co administered medicinal products, which could 
decrease their gastrointestinal absorption. Increased bioavailability of co administrated medicinal 
products was not observed in the conducted drug-drug interaction studies. As patiromer is not 
absorbed or metabolised by the body, there are limited effects on the function of other medicinal 
products. 
As precautionary measure, and based on the data summarised below, administration of patiromer 
should therefore be separated by at least 3 hours from other oral medicinal products. 
In vivo studies 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of patiromer did not affect the bioavailability as measured by the area 
under the curve (AUC) of amlodipine, cinacalcet, clopidogrel, furosemide, lithium, metoprolol, 
trimethoprim, verapamil and warfarin. For these medicinal products no separation is needed. 
Concomitant administration of patiromer showed reduced bioavailability of ciprofloxacin, 
levothyroxine and metformin. However, there was no interaction when patiromer and these medicinal 
products were taken 3 hours apart. 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In vitro studies 
In vitro studies have shown no potential interaction of patiromer with the following active substances: 
allopurinol, amoxicillin, apixaban, acetylsalicylic acid, atorvastatin, azilsartan, benazepril, bumetanide, 
canagliflozin, candesartan, captopril, cephalexin, dapagliflozin, digoxin, empagliflozin, enalapril, 
eplerenone, finerenone, fosinopril, glipizide, irbesartan, lisinopril, losartan, olmesartan, perindopril, 
phenytoin, quinapril, ramipril, riboflavin, rivaroxaban, sacubitril, sevelamer, spironolactone, 
tacrolimus, torasemide, trandolapril, and valsartan. 
In vitro studies have shown potential interaction of patiromer with bisoprolol, carvedilol, 
mycophenolate mofetil, nebivolol, quinidine, and telmisartan. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of patiromer in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of patiromer during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast 
feeding woman to patiromer is negligible. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast 
feeding or to discontinue/abstain from patiromer therapy taking into account the benefit of breast 
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of patiromer on fertility in humans. Animal studies showed no effects 
on reproductive function or fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patiromer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The majority of the adverse reactions (ARs) reported from trials in adult patients were gastrointestinal 
disorders, with the most frequently reported ARs being constipation (6.2%), hypomagnesaemia 
(5.3%), diarrhoea (3%), abdominal pain (2.9%) and flatulence (1.8%). Gastrointestinal disorder 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reactions were generally mild to moderate in nature, did not appear to be dose related, generally 
resolved spontaneously or with treatment, and none were reported as serious. Hypomagnesaemia was 
mild to moderate, with no patient developing a serum magnesium level <1 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials are listed below by system organ class (SOC) and by 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and 
uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare (<1/10 000), not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The safety of patiromer for the treatment of hyperkalaemia has been studied in a single trial of 23 
paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years of age. The adverse reaction profile observed in paediatric 
patients was broadly consistent with the safety profile in adults. The safety of patiromer has not been 
studied in patients less than 6 years of age. 
Adverse reactions were reported for 4 subjects overall; 3 in age group 12 to <18 years and 1 in age 
group 6 to <12 years. In 2 of these subjects, the adverse reactions belonged to the SOC gastrointestinal 
disorders, i.e., diarrhoea, constipation, frequent bowel movements, and flatulence. The remaining 
adverse drug reactions were blood calcium increased and hypokalaemia. These were all non-serious 
adverse reactions and mild to moderate in severity. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Since excessive doses of patiromer may result in hypokalaemia, serum potassium levels should be 
monitored. Patiromer is excreted after approximately 24 to 48 hours, based on average gastrointestinal 
transit time. If it is determined that medical intervention is required, appropriate measures to restore 
serum potassium may be considered. 
Paediatric population 
Doses in excess of 25.2 g patiromer per day for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and in excess of 12 g 
for children 6 to less than 12 years old have not been tested. Since excessive doses of patiromer may 
result in hypokalaemia, serum potassium levels should be monitored. If it is determined that medical 
intervention is required, appropriate measures to restore serum potassium may be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and hyperphosphataemia. ATC 
code: V03AE09 
Mechanism of action 
Patiromer is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a calcium-sorbitol complex as a 
counterion. 
Patiromer increases faecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the 
gastrointestinal lumen, resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In healthy adult subjects, patiromer caused a dose dependent increase in faecal potassium excretion, 
and a corresponding decrease in urinary potassium excretion with no change in serum potassium. 
25.2 g of patiromer, administered once daily for 6 days, resulted in a mean increase in faecal 
potassium excretion of 1,283 mg/day, and a mean decrease in urinary potassium excretion of 
1,438 mg/day. Daily urinary calcium excretion increased from baseline by 53 mg/day. 
In an open label study to assess the time to onset of action, a statistically significant reduction in serum 
potassium in hyperkalaemic patients was observed at 7 hours after the first dose. Following 
discontinuation of patiromer, potassium levels remained stable for 24 hours after the last dose, then 
rose again during a 4-day observation period. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of patiromer were demonstrated in a two-part, single blind randomised 
withdrawal study that evaluated this treatment in hyperkalaemic adult patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) on stable doses of at least one RAAS inhibitor (i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitor [ACEI], angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] or aldosterone antagonist [AA]). 
In Part A, 243 patients were treated with patiromer for 4 weeks. Patients with a baseline serum 
potassium of 5.1 mEq/L to <5.5 mEq/L (mmol/L) received a starting dose of 8.4 g patiromer per day 
(as a divided dose) and patients with a baseline serum potassium of 5.5 mEq/L to <6.5 mEq/L received 
a starting dose of 16.8 g patiromer per day (as a divided dose). The dose was titrated, as needed, based 
on the serum potassium level, assessed starting on Day 3 and then at weekly visits to the end of the 
4 week treatment period, with the aim of maintaining serum potassium in the target range (3.8 mEq/L 
to <5.1 mEq/L). The mean daily doses of patiromer were 13 g and 21 g in patients with serum 
potassium of 5.1 to <5.5 mEq/L and 5.5 to <6.5 mEq/L, respectively. 
The mean age of patients was 64 years (54% aged 65 and over, 17% aged 75 and over), 58% of 
patients were men, and 98% were Caucasian. Approximately 97% of patients had hypertension, 57% 
had type 2 diabetes, and 42% had heart failure. 
Mean serum potassium levels and change in serum potassium from Part A Baseline to Part A Week 4 
is shown in Table 1. For the Part A secondary outcome, 76% (95% CI: 70%, 81%) of patients had a 
serum potassium in the target range of 3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L at Part A Week 4.

In Part B, 107 patients with a Part A baseline serum potassium of 5.5 mEq/L to <6.5 mEq/L and whose 
serum potassium was in the target range (3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L) at Part A Week 4 and still 
receiving RAAS inhibitor treatment were randomised to continue patiromer or to receive placebo for 
8 weeks to evaluate the effect of withdrawing patiromer on serum potassium. In patients randomised to 
patiromer, the mean daily dose was 21 g at the start of Part B and during Part B. 
The Part B primary endpoint was the change in serum potassium from Part B baseline to the earliest 
visit at which the patient’s serum potassium was first outside of the range of 3.8 to <5.5 mEq/L or to 
Part B Week 4 if the patient’s serum potassium remained in the range. In Part B, serum potassium in 
patients on placebo increased significantly relative to patients who remained on patiromer (p<0.001). 
More placebo patients (91% [95% CI: 83%, 99%]) developed a serum potassium ≥5.1 mEq/L at any 
time during Part B than patiromer patients (43% [95% CI: 30%, 56%]), p<0.001. More placebo 
patients (60% [95% CI: 47%, 74%]) developed a serum potassium ≥5.5 mEq/L at any time during 
Part B than patiromer patients (15% [95% CI: 6%, 24%]), p<0.001. 
The potential of patiromer to enable concomitant RAAS inhibitor treatment was also assessed in 
part B. Fifty two percent (52%) of subjects receiving placebo discontinued RAAS inhibitor treatment 
because of recurrent hyperkalaemia compared with 5% of subjects treated with patiromer. 
The effect of treatment with patiromer for up to 52 weeks was evaluated in an open label study of 
304 hyperkalaemic patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus on stable doses of a RAAS 
inhibitor. The mean age of patients was 66 years (59.9% aged 65 and over, 19.7% aged 75 and over), 
63% of patients were men, and all were Caucasian. Decreases in serum potassium with patiromer 
treatment were maintained over 1 year of chronic treatment as shown in Figure 1, with a low incidence 
of hypokalaemia (2.3%) and the majority of subjects reaching (97.7%) and maintaining target serum 
potassium levels (overall during maintenance period, serum potassium was within the target range for 
approximately 80% of the time). In patients with a baseline serum potassium of >5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L 
who received an initial dose of 8.4 g patiromer per day, the mean daily dose was 14 g; in those with a 
baseline serum potassium of >5.5 to <6.0 mEq/L who received an initial dose of 16.8 g patiromer per 
day, the mean daily dose was 20 g during the entire study.

Study Visit (week) 
Follow-Up 
(day) 
The ability of patiromer to enable concomitant spironolactone treatment was investigated in a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in heart failure patients who were clinically 
indicated to receive AA. Patients initiated spironolactone at 25 mg/day at the same time as their 
randomised treatment (patiromer 12.6 g BID or placebo), and were up-titrated to 50 mg/day after 
Day 14 if serum potassium was >3.5 and ≤5.1 mEq/L. Of the 105 patients who were randomised and 
received study treatment (patiromer 56; placebo 49), mean age was 68.3 years, 60.6% were men, 
97.1% were Caucasian, and mean eGFR was 81.3 mL/min. Mean baseline serum potassium values 
were 4.71 mEq/L for patiromer and 4.68 mEq/L for placebo. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in serum potassium to the end of the 28-day 
treatment period, was significantly lower (p<0.001) in the patiromer group (LS mean [SEM]: 
−0.21 [0.07] mEq/L) as compared to the placebo group (LS mean [SEM]: +0.23 [0.07] mEq/L). There 
were also fewer patients in the patiromer group with serum potassium values >5.5 mEq/L (7.3% vs. 
24.5%; p=0.027) and more patients on spironolactone 50 mg/day (90.9% versus 73.5%, p=0.022). 
The ability of patiromer to enable concomitant spironolactone treatment in patients with resistant 
hypertension and CKD was further investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study over 12 weeks. Normokalaemic patients initiated spironolactone at 25 mg per day together with 
their randomised treatment (patiromer 8.4 g or placebo per day). Patiromer/placebo was titrated 
weekly (up to 25.2 g per day) to maintain serum potassium ≥4.0 mEq/L and ≤5.1 mEq/L. At week 3 or 
after, spironolactone dose was increased to 50 mg per day for subjects with systolic blood pressure 
≥120 mmHg and serum potassium ≤5.1 mEq/L. 
Of the 295 randomized patients receiving study treatment (patiromer 147; placebo 148), mean age was 
68.1 years, 51.9% were men, 98.3% were Caucasian, and mean eGFR was 35.73 mL/min/1.73 m2. At 
randomization, mean baseline serum potassium values were 4.74 mEq/L for patiromer and 4.69 mEq/L 
for placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of subjects remaining on spironolactone at 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Week 12, was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the patiromer group (85.7%) compared to the placebo 
group (66.2%). Significantly more patients received spironolactone 50 mg/day (69.4% versus 51.4%). 
Overall, patients in the patiromer group remained on spironolactone 7.1 days longer (95% CI 2.212.0; 
p=0.0045) compared to the placebo group and received significantly higher cumulative doses of 
spironolactone (2942.3 (SE 80.1) mg vs 2580.7 (SE 95.8) mg, p=0.0021). 
There were also significantly fewer patients in the patiromer group with serum potassium values 
≥5.5 mEq/L (35.4% vs. 64.2%, p<0.001).  
At Week 12, the mean systolic blood pressure had decreased by 11.0 mmHg (SD 15.34) in the 
spironolactone + placebo group and by 11.3 mmHg (SD 14.11) in the spironolactone + patiromer 
group. These decreases from baseline were statistically significant within each treatment group 
(p<0.0001), but not statistically significant between the groups. 
Overall, in the phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, 99.5% of patients were receiving RAAS inhibitor therapy 
at baseline, 87.0% had CKD with eGFR <60  mL/min/1.73  m2, 65.6% had diabetes mellitus and 
47.5% had heart failure. 
Effect of food 
In an open-label study, 114 patients with hyperkalaemia were randomized to patiromer once daily with 
food or without food. Serum potassium at the end of treatment, the change from baseline in serum 
potassium, and the mean dose of patiromer were similar between groups. 
Paediatric population 
An open-label, multiple-dose study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of patiromer for oral 
suspension in children and adolescents 6 to <18 years of age with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and 
hyperkalaemia. Patients with severe gastrointestinal diagnosis or surgery were excluded. The study 
included 2 treatment phases; first, an initial 14-day dose finding phase, followed by an up to 24-week 
long-term (LT) treatment phase with a total of up to 26 treatment weeks. The study consisted of two 
age groups 12 to <18 years of age and 6 to <12 years of age, and the starting doses of patiromer in 
each age group were selected based on the median weights. Patiromer was given once daily as a 
powder for oral suspension. 
Overall, 23 subjects (14 subjects aged 12 to <18 years and 9 subjects aged 6 to <12 years) completed 
the dose finding phase, and 21 subjects (12 subjects aged 12 to <18 years and 9 subjects aged 6 to <12 
years) completed the LT treatment phase. No subject discontinued the study due to safety concerns. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was change from baseline in serum potassium levels at 
Day 14. In both age groups, a decrease in potassium levels was observed by day 14: mean (SD) 
potassium change from baseline was -0.50 (0.542) mEq/L in 12 to <18 years of age and -0.14 (0.553) 
mEq/L in 6 to <12 years of age) and was maintained throughout the study while on treatment 
(Figure 2). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were proportion of subjects with serum potassium within the target 
range (3.8 to 5.0 mEq/L) at Day 14 (dose finding phase) and by visit at any time through month 6 (LT 
treatment phase). In the group 12 to <18 years of age, 50.0% and 81.8% of subjects, achieved serum 
potassium levels within the target range at Day 14 and Week 26, respectively. The patiromer dose of 
4.2 g/day appears to be an appropriate starting dose for this group. In the group 6 to <12 years of age, 
only 12.5% and 22.2% of patients, achieved serum potassium levels within the target range at Day 14 
and Week 26, respectively.

Cohort 1 (Ages 12 to <18): Starting Dose 4.2 g/day
Cohort 2 (Ages 6 to <12): Starting Dose 2 g/day
Notes: a Baseline value was the last non-missing central laboratory value collected before the date and time of 
first dose of patiromer. 
b  Follow-up 2 was an optional site visit and could be a phone call. 
Serum potassium data on or after the date of initiation of dialysis were excluded. 
BL=Baseline; CI=Confidence interval; D=Day; FU=Follow-up; W=Week. 
In the group 12 to <18 years of age, at Day 14 and at end of treatment, the median prescribed 
patiromer dose was 4.2 and 8.4 g/day, and the mean change from baseline in serum potassium was -
0.50 and -1.08 mEq/L, respectively. In the group 6 to <12 years of age, at Day 14 and at end of 
treatment, the median prescribed patiromer dose was 6.0 and 8.0 g/day, and the mean change from 
baseline in potassium was -0.14 and -0.50 mEq/L, respectively. In subjects aged 12 to 17 years, the 
dose-response results qualitatively appeared to show, that a higher dose of patiromer was associated 
with a greater reduction in serum potassium in a treatment interval. However, in the group 6 to <12 
years of age, the results of the dose finding were not conclusive. Further evaluation of patiromer in 
subjects aged 6 to <12 years is thus required to establish benefit risk. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Veltassa in children less than 6 years of age in the treatment of hyperkalaemia (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Patiromer works by binding potassium in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the serum concentration is 
not relevant for its efficacy. Due to the insolubility and nonabsorptive characteristics of this medicinal 
product, many classical pharmacokinetic studies cannot be carried out. 
Patiromer is excreted approximately 24 to 48 hours after intake, based on average gastrointestinal 
transit time. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In radiolabeled studies in rats and dogs, patiromer was not systemically absorbed and was excreted in 
the faeces. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography analysis in rats demonstrated that radioactivity 
was limited to the gastrointestinal tract, with no detectable level of radioactivity in any other tissues or 
organs. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patiromer was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation test (Ames assay), chromosome aberration or rat 
micronucleus assays. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Veltassa is and what it is used for 
Veltassa is a medicine that contains the active substance patiromer. 
This medicine is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with high levels of potassium 
in their blood. 
Too much potassium in the blood can affect how nerves control muscles. This can lead to weakness or 
even paralysis. High potassium levels can also result in an abnormal heartbeat, which can cause 
serious effects on your or your child’s heart rhythm. 
This medicine works by attaching to potassium in the gut. This prevents potassium from entering the 
bloodstream and lowers potassium levels in blood back to normal. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Veltassa  
Do not take Veltassa 
• 
if you or your child are allergic to patiromer or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Veltassa if you or your child have: 
• 
• 
problems swallowing - If you cannot swallow this medication, it won’t work. 
severe stomach or bowel problems - This medicine may cause constipation or diarrhea in some 
patients. 
had major surgery on your stomach or bowel - This medicine works while passing through the 
bowel, so major surgery in this area may impact the effect of this medicine.

Low blood magnesium can occur when taking this medicine. Your doctor will check the magnesium 
level during treatment with this medicine for at least 1 month and may prescribe a magnesium 
supplement if required. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years, as it has not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Veltassa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. 
This medicine may reduce absorption or interact with certain medicines if they are taken by mouth and 
at the same time, such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ciprofloxacin: a medicine to treat bacterial infections 
levothyroxine: a medicine to treat thyroid hormone deficiency 
metformin: a medicine to treat diabetes 
mycophenolate mofetil: a medicine to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted organ 
quinidine: a medicine to treat irregular heart rhythm 
telmisartan, bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol: medicines to treat high blood pressure and for 
heart problems. 
Use all medicines taken by mouth at least 3 hours before or after you use Veltassa. Some medicines 
are not affected by Veltassa, so your doctor or pharmacist may give you a different instruction 
depending on the medicines you or your child are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not 
sure. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Use this medicine during pregnancy and breast feeding only if your doctor considers it necessary. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Veltassa contains sorbitol 
The sorbitol content is approximately 4 g (10.4 kcal) per 8.4 g of patiromer and approximately 0.5 g 
(1.2 kcal) per 1 g of patiromer. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you or 
your child have an intolerance to some sugars or if you or your child have been diagnosed with 
hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot break down 
fructose, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort 
and mild laxative effect. 
Veltassa contains calcium  
If your doctor has told you to limit calcium in your or your child’s diet, talk to your doctor before you 
use this medicine. Your doctor will check the calcium level during treatment with this medicine for at 
least 1 month. 
3. 
How to take Veltassa 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine is administered once daily. The recommended starting dose of this medicine varies with 
age. Multiple sachets may be used to achieve the desired dose. Your doctor may adjust the daily dose 
depending on the potassium level in your or your child’s blood, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g daily. 
Adults  
Starting dose: 8.4 g patiromer (the content of one 8.4 g sachet) once daily. 
Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
Starting dose: 4 g patiromer (the content of four 1 g sachets) once daily. Switch to 8.4 g patiromer 
sachets if doses above 7 g are needed. 
Your doctor will decide on the duration of the treatment based on the potassium level in blood. 
Use this medicine at least 3 hours before or after other medicines taken by mouth unless your doctor or 
pharmacist gives you different advice. 
Method of administration 
Before you take this medicine, it needs to be mixed with water as described below. The volume of 
water depends on your dose: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
1 g patiromer: 10 mL (2 teaspoons) 
2 g patiromer: 20 mL (4 teaspoons) 
3 g patiromer: 30 mL(6 teaspoons) 
4 g patiromer: 40 mL (3 tablespoons) 
Above 4 g patiromer: 80 mL (6 tablespoons) 
Prepare the mixture according to the following steps: 
• 
• 
Pour half of the water in a glass, add the required number of Veltassa sachets and stir. 
Add the remaining half of the water and stir thoroughly. The powder does not dissolve but 
forms a suspension, which might feel grainy. 
You may add more water to the mixture to help you swallow the medicine. Please note that with 
larger volumes the powder might settle down more quickly. 
Drink the mixture within 1 hour after preparation. If powder remains in the glass after drinking, 
add more water, stir and drink immediately. You may need to do this again to make sure that 
you have taken all the powder. 
• 
• 
If you like, you can use the following liquids or soft foods instead of water to prepare the mixture by 
following the same steps as described above: apple juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice, orange 
juice, grape juice, pear juice, apricot nectar, peach nectar, yoghurt, milk, thickener (for example: 
cornstarch), apple sauce, vanilla and chocolate pudding.  
When using such liquids and soft foods, follow your or your child’s dietary recommendations on 
potassium intake. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
You should drink only moderate amounts (less than 400 mL per day) of cranberry juice as it can affect 
other medicines. 
Use the prepared Veltassa suspension with or without meals, preferably at the same time each day. 
Never heat this medicine or add it to heated foods or liquids. 
Do not take this medicine as a dry powder. 
If you use a nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, follow the steps described 
above to prepare the suspension for oral administration. For doses up to 8.4 g patiromer, use the 
volume as described above. For doses above 8.4 g and up to16.8 g patiromer use a total volume of 160 
mL (12 tablespoons) and for doses above 16.8 g and up to 25.2 g patiromer use a total volume of 240 
mL (18 tablespoons). These volumes ensure that the suspension readily flows through the tubes.  
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tubes made from polyurethane, silicone, and polyvinyl chloride may be used. The recommended 
diameter of tubes is 2.17 mm (6.5 Fr) or larger. After administration of the suspension, the tube should 
be flushed with water. Follow tube manufacturer’s instructions. 
If you take more Veltassa than you should 
Stop using this medicine and talk to your doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
If you forget to take Veltassa 
If you or your child have missed a dose, take it as soon as possible on the same day. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you miss more than one dose, contact your doctor. 
If you stop taking Veltassa 
Do not stop using this medicine without your doctor’s approval, as the potassium blood level may 
increase.

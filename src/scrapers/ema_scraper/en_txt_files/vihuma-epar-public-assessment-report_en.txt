1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Octapharma AB submitted on 28 September 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Vihuma, through the centralised procedure. As this application 
concerns active substance(s) already authorised via the centralised procedure, 'automatic' access was 
granted by the CHMP on 26 May 2016. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Vihuma can be used for all age groups. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder 
for an authorised medicinal product. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, quality, non-clinical and clinical data 
with a letter from a MAH Octapharma AB allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, non-clinical and/or 
clinical data. 
This application is submitted as a multiple of Nuwiq authorised on 24 July 2014 in accordance with Article 
82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0214/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-001024-PIP01-10-M01 was not yet completed as 
some measures were deferred. The PDCO discussed the completed studies on EMEA-C1-001024-PIP01-10-
M01 and considered that these are compliant with the latest Agency’s Decision (P/0214/2012) of 28 
September 2013. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication.

scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing 
authorisation to Vihuma.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Haemophilia A is an inherited sex-linked disorder of blood coagulation in which affected males do not produce 
functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in sufficient quantities to achieve satisfactory haemostasis. The 
incidence of congenital haemophilia A is approximately 1 in 10,000 births. Disease severity is classified 
according to the level of FVIII activity (% of normal) as mild (>5% to <40%), moderate (1% to 5%) or 
severe (<1%). This deficiency in FVIII predisposes patients with haemophilia A to recurrent bleeding 
episodes (BEs) in joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or 
surgical trauma.  
Without adequate treatment, these repeated haemarthroses and haematomas lead to long-term sequelae 
with severe disability. Other less frequent, but more severe bleeding sites, are the central nervous system, 
the urinary or gastrointestinal tract, eyes and the retro-peritoneum. Patients with haemophilia A are at high 
risk of developing major and life-threatening BEs after surgical procedures, even after minor procedures such 
as tooth extraction.  
The development of cryoprecipitate and subsequently FVIII concentrates, obtained by fractionation of human 
plasma, provided replacement FVIII and greatly improved clinical management and life expectancy of 
patients with haemophilia A. Replacement therapy with exogenous FVIII successfully adjusts haemostasis in 
these patients, temporarily. Prophylaxis with FVIII concentrates is currently the preferred treatment regimen 
for patients with severe haemophilia A, especially in very young patients. The majority of patients receiving 
prophylaxis are treated 3-times weekly or every other day at a dose of 25–40 international units (IU)/kg (or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/814221/2016 
Page 6/13 
  
  
15–25 IU/kg in an intermediate dose regimen), although an escalating dose regimen is also used. However, 
on-demand treatment is still the predominant replacement approach in many countries.  
The most serious complication in the treatment of haemophilia A is the development of neutralising 
antibodies (inhibitors) against FVIII, rendering the patient resistant to replacement therapy and thereby 
increasing the risk of unmanageable bleeding events, particularly arthropathy and disability.  
Vihuma is a recombinant B-domain-deleted (BDD) rFVIII human FVIII concentrate that is produced in 
genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. The rationale for using a human cell line for 
rFVIII expression was in order to more closely mimic the pattern of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of 
endogenous FVIII, resulting in elimination of potentially antigenic epitopes created during production in non-
human cells. N-glycosylation of Vihuma shows the same distribution of N-glycosylation types outside the 
FVIII B-domain as human plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII). The only type of sialic acid present is N-
acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), reported to be antigenic 
in man, was not detected.  
Vihuma is presented as lyophilised powder and is reconstituted with 2.5 mL of sterilised water for injections 
in a syringe in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, and 2000 IU of recombinant factor VIII 
per vial.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to data provided in Module 3 for Nuwiq and no additional data have been provided. 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Nuwiq application, the quality data in support of the 
Vihuma application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Nuwiq dossier, which have been 
assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.2.2.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the quality data. All the quality data 
have been assessed for Nuwiq application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. The ongoing 
recommendations for future quality development for Nuwiq are applicable to Vihuma. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to data provided in Module 4 for Nuwiq and no additional studies have been 
provided. Since this application is an informed consent of the Nuwiq application, the non-clinical data in 
support of the Vihuma application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Nuwiq dossier, which 
have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has referred to the Environmental Risk Assessment for Nuwiq. According to the “Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human use” substances like amino acids, 
peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from the guideline since they are unlikely to result 
in significant risk to the environment. Human-cl rhFVIII is a polypeptide and thereby exempted, 
consequently, an environmental risk assessment is not required. Marketing of Vihuma in the European Union 
is not expected to increase the environmental risk.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the non-clinical data. All the non-
clinical data have been assessed in the application for reference medicinal product, Nuwiq and adequately 
reflected in the Product Information. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Reference has been made to data provided in Module 5 for Nuwiq and no additional studies have been 
provided. Since this application is an informed consent of the Nuwiq application, the clinical data in support of 
the Vihuma application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Nuwiq dossier, which have been 
assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the clinical data. All the clinical data 
have been assessed for Nuwiq application and adequately reflected in the Product Information.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
Conclusion 
The applicant has submitted a Risk Management Plan RMP and states that it is the same RMP as the currently 
approved RMP for Nuwiq. 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.3 is acceptable.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.  Product information 
The Product information of Vihuma is identical to the Nuwiq product information. Only the name of the 
medicinal product is different and addresses of Biotest AG are listed as local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet instead of Octapharma AB. 
Consultation with target patient groups 
The applicant states in Module 1.13, that the package leaflet intended to be used for Vihuma includes the 
same text as the package leaflet approved for Nuwiq. Therefore, a consultation with target patient groups 
has not been performed for the package leaflet of Vihuma by the applicant. 
Braille 
The applicant states in Module 1.13, that the invented name of the medicinal product, followed by its 
strength is printed on the outer carton in Braille.

2.7.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vihuma (simoctocog alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 22 May 2014, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This Marketing Authorisation application for Vihuma has been submitted by Octapharma AB. as an informed 
consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Nuwiq medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date 
quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Vihuma. The application for Vihuma concerns the identical strengths 
to those approved for Nuwiq and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be 
found in the Nuwiq CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) 
published on the EMA website. 
Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Nuwiq initial 
marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-authorisation procedures, the CHMP considers 
that the benefit/risk balance for Vihuma is positive. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vihuma is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Vihuma is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
Vihuma can be used for all age groups.   
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 17 February 2012, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for 
Caprelsa  This  implied  that,  pursuant  to  Article  14-a  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  and  Article  5  of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete 
ongoing  studies,  or  to  conduct  new  studies,  as  listed  in  Annex  II.E  of  the  MA,  the  so-called  Specific 
Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. Therefore, 
pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 507/2006, the MAH Genzyme Europe BV, submitted to the Agency on 28 July 2022 an application for 
renewal of the conditional MA for Caprelsa. The expiry date of the MA is 21 February 2023. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 20-May-2021 to 19-May-2022. 
Reference is made to the ongoing procedure EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043 which intends to fulfil the 
Specific Obligation and to switch the conditional marketing authorisation into a marketing authorisation 
not subject to specific obligations. 
2.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
2.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
This being a conditional Marketing Authorisation and pursuant to Article 14a(4) of Regulation (EC) 
No726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
On 04 March 2020, the MAH submitted a type II variation for Caprelsa(vandetanib) to request the closure 
of  the  Specific  Obligation  (SOB001),  and  consequently  the  switch  from  a  conditional  to  a  standard 
marketing 
authorisation 
(not 
subject 
to 
Specific 
Obligations). 
This 
variation 
(EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043) is currently under review. A CHMP opinion is expected in September 
2022. 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOB have been submitted that are assessed 
within the ongoing procedure EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/113263/2023  
Page 4/26 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, no new data have emerged. Assessment of the data 
submitted in fulfilment of the SOB is provided in parallel in the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043. As reference the evaluation of the data indicate no change in the 
benefit/risk of the product which remains positive and acceptable considering the restricted therapeutic 
indication of Caprelsa (vandetanib) to RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). 
3.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific 
Obligations as per parallel variation (EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043) and having confirmed that 
benefit risk balance for Caprelsa remains favourable in the therapeutic indication restricted to RET 
mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) as per the pending outcome of the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043, therefore recommends by consensus the renewal of the conditional 
marketing authorisation.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
The renewal requires no amendments to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
Conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product

The HCPs educational materials should include the following key elements: 
QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes 
•  CAPRELSA prolongs the QTc interval and can cause Torsades de pointes and sudden death  
•  CAPRELSA treatment must not be started in patients: 
o  Whose ECG QTc interval is greater than 480 msec; 
o  Who have congenital long QTc syndrome; 
o  Who have a history of Torsades de pointes unless all risk factors that contributed to 
Torsades de pointes have been corrected; 
•  The need for an ECG, and serum levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium and thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) and the times and situations when it should be performed; 
•  Patients who develop a single value of corrected ECG QTc interval of at least 500 msec should 
stop taking CAPRELSA. Dosing can be resumed at a reduced dose after return of the ECG QTc 
interval to pre-treatment status has been confirmed and correction of possible electrolyte 
imbalance has been made; 
•  If QTc increases markedly but stays below 500 msec, the advice of a cardiologist should be 
sought; 
•  Details of medicinal products where the co-administration of CAPRELSA is either contraindicated 
or not recommended; 
•  The role and use of the Patient Alert Card. 
Posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES)  also  known  as  reversible  posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) 
•  PRES should be considered in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual 
disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. A brain MRI should be performed in any 
patient presenting with seizures, confusion or altered mental status; 
•  The need to counsel patients about the risk of prolonged QTc and PRES and inform them of what 
symptoms and signs to be aware of and the actions to take;

6.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance 
6.1.  EFFICACY 
During the reporting period of this ACO, an addendum to the CSR of the pivotal study D4200C00058 
(dated 10 March 2022) has been prepared which integrates a reanalysis of RET status using new 
methodologies. An amendment to the non-interventional study OBS14778 has also been performed. 
Efficacy and safety results are provided below. 
►Addendum  to  CSR  of  Study  D4200C00058  (LPS14811)  “An  International,  Phase  III,  Randomized, 
Double Blinded, Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Study to Assess the Efficacy of ZD6474 versus Placebo 
in  Subjects  with  Unresectable  Locally  Advanced  or  Metastatic  Medullary  Thyroid  Cancer”  (Dated  10 
March 2022) 
• In the original CSR of the Study, 79 patients had no M918T mutation identified. Of these 79 patients, 
69 had enough tissue sample to allow a reanalysis of RET mutation status based on new available assays. 
• Most patients were reclassified as RET mutant (52/69 patients) and a minority (17/69 patients) 
had no RET mutation (M918T or other) detected. 
• Of these 17 RET negative patients, 14 patients had a RAS mutation (9 treated with vandetanib 
and  5  treated  with  placebo),  1  patient  treated  with  vandetanib  had  a  BRAF  mutation  and  2 
patients (1 in each arm) had no mutation identified. 
• In this addendum, newly identified RET mutant patients (n = 52) were pooled with RET mutant patients 
reported in the initial D4200C00058 CSR (n = 187), leading to a total number of 239 RET mutant patients 
and  17  RET  negative  patients.  The  efficacy  end  points  included  PFS  based  on  central  read  RECIST 
assessment (primary end-point) as well as the following secondary end-points: ORR, DCR, OS, CEA and 
calcitonin serum responses. 
•  The  efficacy  of  vandetanib,  already  established  in  RET  mutant  patients,  was  confirmed  from  this 
analysis including 52 additional RET mutant patients. 
•  Of  those  17  patients  RET  negative,  the  activity  of  vandetanib  remained  numerically  higher  than 
placebo: 
- The PFS HR was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.03 1.53) with a two-year PFS rate of 90% in patients treated with 
vandetanib versus 50% in patients treated with placebo. 
- An objective tumor response was observed in 18.2% (2/11 RET negative patients; 2/9 (22.2%) RAS 
mutant  patients)  treated  with  vandetanib  versus  none  of  those  treated  with  placebo  (n  =  6).  Both 
patients with an objective response had a concomitant decline of CEA and/or calcitonin serum levels. 
- The only RET negative patient who died from thyroid cancer received the placebo.

►Addendum  to  the  PASS  report  OBS14778  (D4200C00104)  “International  Observational  Study  to 
Evaluate the Benefit/Risk of Vandetanib (CAPRELSA) 300 mg in RET Mutation Negative and RET Mutation 
Positive  Patients  with  Symptomatic,  Aggressive,  Sporadic,  Unresectable,  Locally  Advanced/Metastatic 
Medullary Thyroid Cancer” (09 March 2022) 
•  Study  OBS14778  (D4200C00104)  was  conducted  to  fulfill  the  post  authorization  specific  obligation 
linked  to  the  conditional  MA  of  vandetanib.  It  was  conducted  to  confirm,  in  real  life  conditions,  the 
benefit/risk of vandetanib 300 mg, both in RET negative and RET mutant participants with symptomatic, 
aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic MTC. 
• Because study OBS14778 was observational, the evaluation of objective response provided in the CSR 
was  based  on  investigator  assessment  of  imaging  for  all  patients,  including  those  coming  from  study 
D4200C00058. Since the primary analysis of study D4200C00058 was based on a blinded central review 
of imaging, the MAH thought it was more rigorous to reanalyze the objective response in study OBS14778 
using the blinded central review dataset of study D4200C00058. 
• Using this blinded central review data, 79 patients (instead of 75) were evaluable for analysis in study 
OBS14778, 58 RET mutant patients (instead of 55) and 21 RET negative patients (instead of 20).  
-  The  objective  response  rate  in  RET  negative  patients  remained  lower  than  in  RET  mutant  patients 
(9.5%  vs  39.7%).  Importantly,  the  two  RET  negative  patients  having  an  objective  response  were 
carrying a RAS mutation and came from the ZETA phase III study. 
- The duration of treatment (27.6 months vs 23.4 months in RET negative vs RET mutant patients), the 
DCR (85.7% vs 87.9%) and PFS (35.7 months vs 25.4 months) were not influenced by RET status. 
- Cancer death was lower in RET negative patients than in RET mutant patients (4.8% vs 13.8%). 
•  Treatment  with  vandetanib  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  calcitonin,  which  was  delayed  in  RET 
negative versus RET mutant patients. There was also a decrease in CEA which was comparable in both 
RET negative and RET mutant patients. 
CHMP rapporteur’s comment: 
Assessment of these data is part of the ongoing procedure EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043. 
Literature 
Several  publications  on  the  activity  of  vandetanib  were  identified  during the  reporting  period  and  are 
described hereafter. No new relevant efficacy and/or effectiveness findings in approved indications were 
identified during the reporting interval.

Feb;10(2):124-30 (6).  
Background: A significantly higher prevalence of the RET p.Met918Thr somatic mutation, identified by 
direct sequencing, was previously reported in large MTC (> 2 cm) compared to smaller tumors. The aim 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/113263/2023

of  this  study  was  to  correlate  the  full  RET  and  RAS  mutation  profile,  identified  by  a  Next  Generation 
Sequencing approach, with the growth rate, proliferation and tumor size of MTC.  
Methods:  Data  of  149  sporadic  MTC  patients  were  correlated  with  RET  mutations  and  Ki67  positivity. 
Eighty-one cases had a somatic RET mutation, 40 had a RAS mutation and 28 were negative.  
Results: A significantly higher prevalence of RET mutations was found in MTC > 2 cm. A higher prevalence 
of  RET  more  aggressive  mutations,  higher  allelic  frequencies  and,  higher  percentage  of  Ki67  positive 
cells were found in larger tumors which had also a worse outcome. Our study highlights the predominant 
role of RET somatic mutations in MTC tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that RET mutation prevalence and 
allelic frequency (AF) are significantly higher in larger tumors. 
Conclusions: Based on these results, we can conclude that RET mutated C-cells’ growth and proliferation 
are more rapid than those of non-mutated cells and give origin to bigger and more aggressive MTC.  
MAH  comment:  These  results  suggest  that  patients  with  RET  mutant  MTC  have  a  worse  prognosis 
compared to RAS mutant/RET negative and RAS negative/RET negative patients.

Discontinuation of TKI Treatment in Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma - Lessons from Individual 
Cases With Long-Term Follow-Up. Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2021 Sep 29;12:718418 (15).  
Background: The aim of this retrospective analysis is to analyse impact of TKIs discontinuation on MTC 
disease course after longer-term therapy.  
Methods: Medical records of 161 MTC patients with vandetanib treatment of up to 87 months followed 
by discontinuation for concerns of toxicity or due to side-effects in a tertiary referral endocrine tumour 
centre were retrospectively reviewed. Analysis included a review of patients' records for TKI indication, 
and treatment response as well indications for continued TKI discontinuation and follow-up by clinical 
assessment, calcitonin, and CEA doubling times as well as imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography 
[CT]).  
Results: Seven MTC patients [six sporadic MTC, 1 Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2a (MEN2a)] with 
previous  vandetanib  treatment  (median:  41  months;  range  7-87  months)  and  continued  TKI 
discontinuation were identified out of 161 analysed MTC files. TKI treatment was initiated due to high 
tumour burden and symptoms or RECIST progression in all patients.  
• Two patients (29%) remained stable after discontinuation of vandetanib until now (follow-up of 47 and 
61 months). Both patients had been on TKI therapy for 73 and 58 months.  
• Five patients (71%) developed progressive disease after TKI discontinuation:  
- In two patients, vandetanib was restarted after 45 and 52 months resulting again in disease control.  
-  One  patient  was  enrolled  in  a  new  RET  kinase  inhibitor  trial  after  45  months  of  vandetanib 
discontinuation.  
- Two patients declined restart of treatment due to mental health issues leading to discontinuation of 
vandetanib  in  the  first  place  (after  7  and  38  months  of  treatment)  and  both  patients  died  of  rapidly 
progressive disease.  
• At time points of tumour progression, calcitonin-doubling time (CDT) was < 2 years in all patients.  
Conclusion:  This  case  series  suggests  that  discontinuation  of  long-term  vandetanib  treatment  with 
documented  stable  disease  does  not  automatically  result  in  rapid  disease  progression  but  may  be 
followed  by  prolonged  "TKI  free"  stable  disease  in  individual  patients.  Analysis  of  calcitonin  and  CDT

during discontinuation is indicated as it will unmask tumour progression earlier than imaging. Restart 
with the same TKI is possible in case of progression.

patterns,  and  clinical  outcomes  for  patients  with  advanced/metastatic  medullary  thyroid 
cancer. Thyroid Res. 2022; 15(1):2 (16).  
Background: Medullary thyroid cancer accounts for approximately 1.6% of new cases of thyroid cancer. 
The objective of this study was to describe patient characteristics, biomarker testing, treatment patterns, 
and clinical outcomes among patients with advanced/metastatic MTC in a real-world setting in the USA 
and to identify potential gaps in the care of these patients.  
Methods:  Selected  oncologists  retrospectively  reviewed  medical  records  of  patients  aged ≥ 12  years 
diagnosed  with  advanced  MTC.  Patients  must  have  initiated ≥  1  line  of  systemic  treatment  for 
advanced/metastatic MTC between  January 2013-December 2018 to be eligible. Patient characteristics, 
biomarker testing, and treatment patterns were summarized descriptively; PFS and OS were estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
Results:  The  203  patients  included  in  this  study  had  a  mean  (Standard  Deviation  [SD])  age  of  52.2 
(10.4) years; mean (SD) duration of follow-up from start of first-line treatment was 24.5 (16.0) months. 
Most patients (82.8%) were initially diagnosed with stage IVA, IVB, or IVC disease. Among all patients, 
121 (59.6%) had testing for RET mutations, of whom 37.2% had RET-mutant MTC. The RET mutation 
type  was  reported  for  28  patients;  the  most  common  mutations  reported  were  M918T  (64.3%)  and 
C634R (32.1%). Of the 203 patients, 75.9% received only one line of systemic treatment for advanced 
disease, and 36% were still undergoing first-line therapy at the time of data extraction. Cabozantinib 
(30.0%), vandetanib (30.0%), sorafenib (17.2%), and lenvatinib (4.9%) were the most common first-
line  treatments.  Among  49  patients  who  received  second-line  treatment,  most  received  cabozantinib 
(22.4%),  vandetanib  (20.4%),  lenvatinib  (12.2%),  or  sunitinib  (12.2%).  Median  PFS  (95%  CI)  from 
start  of  first  and  second-line  treatments  was  26.6  months  (20.8-60.8)  and  15.3  months  (6.6-not 
estimable  [NE]),  respectively.  Median  OS  from  initiation  of  first  and  second-line  treatment  was  63.8 
months (46.3-NE) and 22.4 months (12.4-NE), respectively.  
Conclusions:  For  the  treatment  of  advanced/metastatic  MTC,  no  specific  preference  of  sequencing 
systemic agents was observed in the first and second-line settings. Considering the recent approval of 
selective  RET  inhibitors  for  patients  with  RET-mutant  MTC,  future  research  should  investigate  how 
treatment patterns evolve for these patients.

Metastasis from Medullary Thyroid Cancers with Long-Term Survival under Vandetanib. Eur 
Thyroid J. 2021 Nov;10(6):517-22 (17). 
Background: Cardiac metastases from thyroid cancers are uncommon with a poor prognosis. There is a 
lack of long-term follow-up studies.  
Cases: We report two cases of cardiac metastasis from MTC. Both patients presented limited metastatic 
disease  apart  from  a  cardiac  metastasis.  The  initial  diagnosis  was  challenging  and  was  facilitated  by 
functional imaging with an immune positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan (PET-CT) 
using an anti-CEA bispecific antibody and a 68Ga-labeled peptide. Both patients were treated with the 
multitarget  kinase inhibitor  vandetanib  with  prolonged  stability.  The  first  patient  was  alive  at  the last 
follow-up,  14  years  after  the  diagnosis  of  cardiac  metastasis.  The  second  patient  required  surgical 
excision of the cardiac mass because of disease progression under vandetanib.

Conclusion: These cases illustrate long-term survival and effectiveness of clinical management of two 
patients who developed cardiac metastases from MTC, in the current era of personalized medicine with 
targeted therapy.  
Gundogan  BD,  Sagcan  F,  Bozdogan  ST,  Balci  Y,  Daloglu  FT,  Citak  EC.  Vandetanib  in  a  Child 
Affected by Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma with Both NF1 and 
Homozygous RET Proto-oncogen Germ-line Mutations. J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol. 2021 Aug 
23;13(3):342-6 (18).  
Background:  Neurofibromatosis  type  1  (NF1)  is  a  common,  autosomal  dominant,  multi-systemic 
neurocutaneous disorder. Medullary thyroid carcinoma has not been reported yet in patients with NF1 
mutation.  
Case: A 15-year-old male patient was diagnosed with both NF1 and MTC, and who had mutations in both 
NF1 and RET genes. Molecular testing revealed a heterozygous mutation in NF1 gene and a homozygous 
mutation in codon 891 in the RET gene. The patient had total thyroidectomy and radical neck dissection. 
Due  to  incomplete  removal  of  lymph  nodes  and  remaining  thyroid  tissue,  vandetanib  treatment  was 
initiated at a dose of 300 mg/day for two years and serum calcitonin and CEA levels gradually decreased 
and reached the normal reference range.  
Conclusion:  Although  vandetanib  has  been  shown  to  improve  progression-free  survival  in  adults  with 
advanced  MTC,  data  in  pediatric  patients  are  limited.  Herein,  we  report  the  use  and  outcome  of 
vandetanib in a pediatric MTC case in which NF1 gene and RET proto-oncogene mutation were identified 
together. 
6.2.  BENEFIT EVALUATION 
Medullary thyroid cancer is a rare cancer (2.1% of all types of thyroid cancers) (1). Most patients (80% 
to 90%) are RET-positive, 10% to 20% are RET negative/RAS mutant and in the remaining patients no 
mutation is identified (4). In routine clinical practice, RET mutation status is rarely evaluated prior to the 
treatment.  
Surgical  resection  of  MTC  is  the  primary  treatment.  For  unresectable,  recurrent,  or  symptomatic  and 
progressing  MTC,  preferred  options  are  vandetanib  and  cabozantinib  as  per  international  guidelines. 
There is no head-to-head study comparing vandetanib versus cabozantinib.  
Vandetanib is an effective first-line treatment option for unresectable, advanced metastatic MTC. In daily 
practice, young patients and those having symptomatic MTC at treatment initiation appear to be long 
responders to vandetanib (12) (13). 
The activity of vandetanib in RET positive patients is well established in the pivotal phase III study (ZETA) 
(11) and its recent addendum to CSR (described in Section 7.3.3.1):  
• The overall response rate (ORR) was 51.7% with vandetanib versus 14.9% with placebo.  
• The hazard ratio for PFS, primary end-point, was 0.46 [95% CI 0.29-0.74] with a 2-year PFS rate of 
55.7% with vandetanib versus 40.1% with placebo.  
A reanalysis of tissue samples of 69 patients lacking M918T mutation was conducted in ZETA study using 
new methodologies. Of these 69 patients, 52 were reclassified as being RET mutant, 14 patients were 
RET negative/RAS mutant (9 treated with vandetanib and 5 treated with placebo), 1 patient treated with 
vandetanib was RET negative/BRAF mutant and 2 patients (1 in each arm) had no mutation identified 
(described in Section 7.3.3.1). The activity of vandetanib in these 17 RET negative patients remained 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/113263/2023  
Page 15/26 
 
 
 
 
numerically higher than placebo:  
• An objective tumor response was observed in 18.2% (2/11 RET negative patients; 2/9 RAS mutant 
patients) treated with vandetanib versus none of those treated with placebo (n = 6). Both patients had 
a concomitant decline of CEA and/or calcitonin serum levels.  
• The PFS HR was 0.21 (95% CI 0.03-1.53) with a two-year PFS rate of 90% with vandetanib versus 
50% with placebo.  
• The only RET negative patient who died from thyroid cancer received the placebo.  
• The safety profile of vandetanib was not influenced by RET status.  
The non-interventional PASS (OBS14778 - Described in Section 7.3.3.2) also included 79 patients treated 
with vandetanib (21 RET negative, 58 RET positive), most of them coming from ZETA study (n=47/79):  
• The objective tumor response in RET negative patients was 9.5% (n=2/21; both patients being RAS 
positive and coming from ZETA study) and 39.7% (n=23/57) in RET positive patients.  
• However, the duration of treatment (27.6 vs 23.4 months in RET negative vs RET mutant), the Disease 
Control Rate (DCR; 85.7% vs 87.9%), and PFS (35.7 vs 25.4 months) were not influenced by RET status. 
Cancer death was lower in RET negative patients (4.8%) than in RET mutant patients (13.8%).  
Considering  that  vandetanib  is  indicated  for  patients  with  aggressive  and  symptomatic  MTC,  that 
vandetanib shows objective responses in RAS mutant patients (main subgroup of RET negative patients), 
that the safety profile of vandetanib is not influenced by RET status, that there is currently no treatment 
alternative to vandetanib in most European countries and that most recent technologies to determine 
RET  status  are  not  available  or  not  reimbursed  everywhere,  the  MAH  considers  that  the  benefit/risk 
balance of vandetanib remains positive regardless of RET status. 
CHMP rapporteur’s comment: 
The applicant’s view that the benefit/risk balance of vandetanib remains positive regardless of RET 
status is not shared. The assessment of this benefit/risk ratio in RET negative patients is part of the 
procedure under investigation EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043. 
6.3.  SAFETY 
Pharmacovigilance inspections 
For local pharmacovigilance (PV) inspections:  
One (1) PV inspection was carried out in France in the period 20 May 2021 to 19 May 2022.  
For Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV) inspections:  
One (1) PV inspections of the Sanofi GPV system took place in the period of 20 May 2021 to 19 May 
2022. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/113263/2023  
Page 16/26 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion:  
The findings observed during the above regulatory PV inspections conducted in the period of 20 May 
2021 to 19 May 2022 did not have any potential or known influence on the benefit-risk balance for 
vandetanib. 
Worldwide marketing approval status  
CAPRELSA is approved in more than 40 countries worldwide. 
Actions taken in the reporting interval for safety reasons during the period 
covered 
On 29 September 2021 (eCTD Sequence No. 0248), prior approval labeling supplement was submitted 
to the United States (US) FDA with the revisions to warning and precautions, adverse reactions, use in 
specific  population  sections,  and  the  medication  guide  regarding  renal  failure  and  wound  healing 
complications.  On  01  March  2022,  Sanofi  received  information  request  (IR)  by  email  from  Safety 
Regulatory Project Manager and Sanofi submitted the proposed labeling comments edits to the United 
States  Prescribing  Information  (USPI)  and  medication  guide  in  response  to  the  Agency  comments  by 
email  on  10  March  2022  and  followed  by  formal  submission  on  16  March  2022  (eCTD  Sequence  No. 
0252). On 18 March 2022, Sanofi received IR by email form the Safety Regulatory Project Manager and 
Sanofi submitted the proposed labeling comments edits to the USPI and medication guide in response 
to  the  agency  comments  on  28  March  2022  (eCTD  Sequence  No.  0253).  On  28  March  2022,  FDA 
approved S-019.  
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
Caprelsa  EU  SmPC  has  been  updated  with  information  on  renal  failure  (sections  4.2  and  4.4)  and  on 
impaired wound healing (section 4.4) within assessment of the variation EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0052 
and of the EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009327/202104 procedure. 
For EU, on the 28 June 2021, MAH received a formal request for supplementary information from CHMP 
after reviewing the OBS14778 PASS report aimed at switching the conditional EU approval to a regular 
one. The authority requested the following information: 
• To elaborate on differences in response rate initially reported at the time of approval and those reported 
in the PASS study.  
• To provide some clarifications on RET mutation analyses performed at the time of approval and in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/113263/2023  
Page 17/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PASS study (details on patient disposition and patient flow over time; confirm how many patients lacking 
M918T mutation at the time of approval were confirmed to be RET negative following re_analysis of RET 
status).  
• To discuss the benefit-risk in the RET negative population given the known substantial toxicity profile 
of CAPRELSA.  
The answer that was submitted 13 October 2021 stated that considering the post-hoc re-analysis of the 
pivotal Study D4200C00058 (LPS14811) the benefit-risk profile of vandetanib is considered acceptable 
in RET-negative patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC with an ORR of 18.2% 
with vandetanib versus 0% with placebo and a PFS rate at two years of 90% with vandetanib versus 
50%  with  placebo.  Interestingly,  RET-negative  patients  having  an  objective  tumor  response  with 
vandetanib  had  a  concomitant  RAS  mutation.  These  patients  represent  the  majority  of  RET-negative 
patients. No new safety signal was observed in RET-negative patients. Thus, Sanofi believes that the 
benefit/risk balance of vandetanib remains positive in the currently approved indication regardless of the 
RET  status  and  vandetanib  should  not  be  contraindicated  in  RET-negative  patients  with  MTC.  Sanofi 
proposed to provide addendum reports to the two studies (OBS14778 and D4200C00058) as soon as 
possible  and,  based  on  the  re-analysis  of  RET  mutation  status  recently  performed,  to  update  more 
adequately the Section 5.1 of the SmPC regarding the RET-negative patients.  
On  the  17  December  2021  another  assessment  report  was  received  concluding  that  the  efficacy  of 
CAPRELSA was not sufficiently established in RET negative patients. Considering the known substantial 
toxicity of CAPRELSA, the benefit-risk balance was considered negative for RET negative patients. Sanofi 
was thus requested to restrict the indication to RET positive patients. The answer to this second request 
was submitted on 18 March 2022. Sanofi submitted the CSR addendum and concluded that based on the 
provided clinical and literature data that based on the provided clinical and literature data, discrepancies 
in  RET  testing  quality  between  institutions  as  well  as  the  lack  of  standard  of  care  for  RET  negative 
patients,  vandetanib  should  remain  a  treatment  option  for  patients  with  aggressive,  symptomatic, 
unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic MTC.  
Another assessment report was received last 16 May 2022, requesting to restrict the use of CAPRELSA 
to RET positive patients. Sanofi is working on the answer.  
On the basis of information available, no other actions for safety reasons were taken in the reporting 
interval, related to investigational uses or marketing experience by the MAH, sponsors of clinical trial(s), 
data monitoring committees, ethics committees or competent authorities and which had:  
• A significant influence on the risk-benefit balance of the authorized medicinal product; and/or  
• An impact on the conduct of a specific clinical trial(s) or on the overall clinical development program 
PRAC rapporteur assessment comment 
At  the  DLP  for  this  renewal,  the  assessment  of  the  variation  EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043  was 
ongoing and a CHMP opinion is expected in September 2022.  
Significant changes to reference safety information 
The Reference Safety Information (RSI) used at the beginning of the period was Company Core Data 
Sheet (CCDS) version 3, dated 19 September 2019.  
The following changes were made:  
WARNINGS section: Following was added with editorial changes:

Renal failure  
Cases of renal failure have been reported in patients treated with vandetanib. Dose interruptions, 
adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary.  
The starting dose should be reduced to 200 mg in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance ≥30 to 
50 mL/min) renal impairment and monitor the QT interval closely. Vandetanib is not recommended for 
use in patients with severe renal impairment (clearance below 30 mL/min). 
There is no information available for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. 
Impaired wound healing  
Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling 
pathway. Therefore, vandetanib has the potential to adversely affect wound healing.  
Withhold vandetanib for at least one month prior to elective surgery. Do not administer vandetanib for 
at least two weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of 
resumption of treatment with vandetanib after resolution of wound healing complications has not been 
established.  
In the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) section, “impaired healing and renal failure” were added.  
The RSI in use at the data lock point (DLP) is CCDS version 4, dated 26 August 2021 attached in 
Appendix 1.1.  
The significant differences between global labeling document ie CCDS for vandetanib version 4 dated 
26 August 2021 and the current EU SmPC for vandetanib dated 30 May 2022 have been presented in 
Appendix 1.2. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
Caprelsa  EU  SmPC  has  been  updated  with  information  on  renal failure  (sections  4.2  and  4.4)  and  on 
impaired wound healing (section 4.4) within assessment of the variation EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0052 
and of the EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009327/202104 procedure. 
Estimated exposure and use patterns 
Cumulative exposure in clinical trials  
Overall, 4729 subjects (4532 patients, 197 healthy subjects) have received vandetanib as an 
investigational product.  
Cumulative and interval patient exposure from postmarketing experience 
The interval worldwide patient exposure to vandetanib is estimated to be approximately 1632 patients, 
including 908 patients in EU countries. 
The global cumulative exposure to vandetanib from 06 April 2011 through 31 May 2022 is estimated to 
be approximately 15 375 patients. In addition, 20 patients were exposed to vandetanib in the Named 
Patient Supply programs. 
Estimation of paediatric population exposure to vandetanib in EU 
The estimated paediatric patient interval exposure to CAPRELSA in Europe is 90 patients.

Data in summary tabulations 
•  Cumulative summary tabulations of serious adverse events from clinical trials: 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
Cumulatively, 4,491 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported from MAH-sponsored clinical trials, 
3,386 were reported with vandetanib, 625 with active comparator, 265 with placebo. For 85 SAEs, IMP 
is still blinded and for 130 SAEs no IMP was given. 
•  Cumulative and interval summary tabulations from postmarketing data sources: 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment: 
Cumulatively, 5,646 ADRs have been reported with vandetanib, 510 of which were reported during the 
present reporting period: 
• 
• 
spontaneous sources: 122 serious ADRs and 362 non serious ADRs; 
solicited sources: 26 serious ADRs. 
The 3 leading SOCs as well as the serious ADRs reported from spontaneous sources, were: 
General disorders and administration site conditions: n = 18 serious ADRs: disease progression (2), 
death (6), asthenia (2), fatigue (2), condition aggravated (1), Critical illness (1), drug ineffective (1), pain (1), Performance 
status decreased (1) and Pyrexia (1). 
Infections  and  infestations:  14  serious  ADRs:  Pneumonia  (5),  Hepatitis  A  (2),  Bronchitis  (1),  Clostridium 
difficile infection (1), Colonic abscess (1), Conjunctivitis (1), Diverticulitis (1), Sepsis (1) and Tooth infection (1). 
Skin and subcutaneous  tissue disorders:  12  serious  ADRs:  Photosensitivity  reaction  (2),  Alopecia 
(1), Dermatitis bullous (1), Epidermal necrosis (1), Erythema multiforme (1), Hair texture abnormal (1), 
Nikolsky’s  sign  (1),  Rash  erythematous  (1),  Skin  lesion  (1),  Trichorrhexis(1)  and  Toxic  epidermal 
necrolysis (1). 
A new case of TEN (Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis) from post-marketing sources has been received during 
the reporting period. Within EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009327/202204 procedure, the MAH has been 
requested to review cumulatively events of TEN reported with vandetanib from all sources. A part from 
this point, review of the leading SOCs as well as the most frequently reported serious ADRs from 
spontaneous sources did not raise any comments with regard to vandetanib safety profile / vandetanib 
therapeutic indication.  
Summaries of significant safety and efficacy findings from clinical trials and 
non-interventional studies 
During the reporting period of this ACO, addendum to the CSR of the pivotal study D4200C00058 
(dated 10 March 2022) has been prepared which integrates a reanalysis of RET status using new 
methodologies. An amendment to the non-interventional study OBS14778 has also been performed.

PRAC rapporteur assessment comment 
Within  EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009327/202204  procedure,  the  MAH  has  been  requested  to  review 
cumulatively  events  of  TEN  reported  with  vandetanib  from  all  sources.  Apart  from  this  point,  no 
significant new information regarding important identified /potential risks associated to vandetanib was 
received during this reporting interval. 
The  MAH  has  been  also  requested,  for  the  next  PSUR  to  review  the  list  of  PSUR  safety  concerns  for 
vandetanib in order to propose the removal of the most well-known and characterised safety concerns 
that would not warrant a review in each PSUR (e.g. diarrhoea, phototoxicity, etc.).  
6.4.  DISCUSSION 
Clinical expert statement 
The  positive  benefit/risk  profile  of  vandetanib  already  established  in  RET  mutant  patients  in  a  pivotal 
phase III study is confirmed. The objective response observed with vandetanib is RET negative patients 
may be lower than in RET mutant patients but remains numerically higher than placebo. Moreover, PFS, 
DCR and the duration of treatment appear comparable regardless of RET status and cancer death rate 
appears lower in RET negative patients compared to RET mutant patients. Considering that vandetanib 
is  indicated  for  patients  with  aggressive  and  symptomatic  MTC,  that  vandetanib  shows  objective 
responses in RAS mutant patients (main subgroup of RET negative patients), that the safety profile of 
vandetanib is not influenced by RET status, that there is no treatment alternative to vandetanib in many 
European countries (cabozantinib is not reimbursed for MTC in most European countries), and that most 
recent technologies to determine RET status are not available or not reimbursed everywhere, the MAH 
considers that the benefit/risk balance of vandetanib remains positive regardless of RET status. 
CHMP rapporteur’s comment: 
No new safety concerns or change in benefits have been identified during the assessment of the annual 
renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation for vandetanib.  
Assessment report

Based on the available safety and efficacy data to date for vandetanib, the overall benefit-risk profile of 
vandetanib  remains  positive  in  aggressive  and  symptomatic  MTC  in  patients with unresectable  locally 
advanced or metastatic disease under the current recommended conditions of use.   
However, the applicant’s view that the benefit/risk balance of vandetanib remains positive regardless of 
RET status is not shared. The assessment of this benefit/risk ratio in RET negative patients is part of the 
procedure under investigation EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043. 
7.  Risk management plan 
No change of the RMP is proposed yet: as written in a previous communication with EMA in 2020, the 
MAH will provide an updated RMP upon approval of the on-going type II variation 
EMEA/H/C/002315/II/0043. 
8.  Changes to the Product Information 
No changes to the Product Information (PI) are introduced with this renewal procedure.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. 
Posology 
Therapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the 
medicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The 
tolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three 
months after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s 
tolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. 
Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the 
patient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when 
evidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment.

Renal impairment 
In patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) no dose 
adjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, 
the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose 
adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available. Administration of Axura is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Axura in children aged below 18 years has not been established. 
No data are available.

Method of administration 
Axura should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. The 
film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Caution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with 
predisposing factors for epilepsy. 
Concomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or 
dextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as 
memantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be 
more frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). 
Some factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful 
monitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a 
vegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by 
states of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. 
In most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart 
failure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited 
data are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following 
interactions may occur: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and 
anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as 
memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant 
administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify 
their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of 
pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The 
same may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one 
published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. 
Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and 
nicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly 
interact with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. 
There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when 
memantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases 
have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal 
relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for 
patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. 
In single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects no relevant active substance-
active substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics 
of galantamine was observed. 
Memantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, 
epoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a 
potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher 
than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and 
compromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Axura has minor to moderate influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Axura and 
1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Axura did not 
differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The 
most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Axura group than in the 
placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation 
(4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). 
The following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies 
with Axura and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Fatigue 
Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-
marketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with Axura. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing 
experience. 
Symptoms 
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with 
either only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases 
below 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system 
(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) 
and/or gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg 
memantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and 
agitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered 
without permanent sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 
400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as 
restlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and 
unconsciousness.

Treatment 
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or 
overdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric 
lavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, 
forced diuresis should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in 
neurodegenerative dementia. 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction. 
Clinical studies 
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe 
Alzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) 
included a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in 
comparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician`s interview based 
impression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer`s disease cooperative study – activities of 
daily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed 
a statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: 
Alzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 
last observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. 
In the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary 
efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) 
from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies 
with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically 
significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. 
When patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a 
statistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated 
patients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, 
p<0.0001).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. 
There is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution 
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to 
150 ng/ml (0.5-1 µmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation 
In man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. 
Main human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 
6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit 
NMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within 
20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally. 
Elimination 
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In 
volunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part 
of total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The 
renal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to 
9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore 
to a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
Linearity 
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) 
of memantine, which is 0.5 µmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal 
vacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum 
concentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the 
effects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but 
not in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not 
disclose any ocular changes. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was 
observed in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic 
properties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed 
in lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown. 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in 
rats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on 
fertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly 
higher than at human exposure.

Oral solution. 
The solution is clear and colourless to light yellowish. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. 
Posology 
Therapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the 
medicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The 
tolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three 
months after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s 
tolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. 
Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the 
patient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when 
evidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. 
Adults 
Dose titration 
The maximum daily dose is 20 mg once daily. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the 
maintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: 
Week 1 (day 1-7): 
The patient should take 0.5 ml solution (5 mg) equivalent to one pump actuation per day for 7 days. 
Week 2 (day 8-14): 
The patient should take 1 ml solution (10 mg) equivalent to two pump actuations per day for 7 days. 
Week 3 (day 15-21): 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The patient should take 1.5 ml solution (15 mg) equivalent to three pump actuations per day for 7 days. 
From Week 4 on: 
The patient should take 2 ml solution (20 mg) equivalent to four pump actuations once a day. 
Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg (2 ml solution, equivalent to four pump actuations) per 
day. 
Elderly 
On the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 20 mg 
per day (2 ml solution, equivalent to four pump actuations) as described above. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) no dose 
adjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two pump actuations). If 
tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according 
to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two pump actuations) per day. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dose 
adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available. Administration of Axura in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Axura in children aged below 18 years has not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Axura should be taken once daily at the same time each day. The solution can be taken with or without 
food. The solution must not be poured or pumped into the mouth directly from the bottle or the pump, 
but should be dosed onto a spoon or into a glass of water using the pump. For detailed instructions on 
the preparation and handling of the product see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Caution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with 
predisposing factors for epilepsy. 
Concomitant use of other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine 
or dextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as 
memantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related may be 
more frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). 
Some factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful 
monitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a 
vegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by 
states of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria.

In most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart 
failure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited 
data are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. 
Excipients: The oral solution contains sorbitol. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) 
should not take this medicinal product. 
Furthermore, this medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
potassium-free. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following 
interactions may occur: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and 
anticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as 
memantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant 
administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify 
their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. 
Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of 
pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The 
same may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one 
published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. 
Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and 
nicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly 
interact with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. 
There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when 
memantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases 
have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal 
relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for 
patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. 
In single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects no relevant active 
substance-active substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was 
observed. 
In a clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics 
of galantamine was observed. 
Memantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, 
epoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For memantine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies indicate a 
potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher 
than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and 
compromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Axura has minor or moderate influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with Axura and 
1,595 patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with Axura did not 
differ from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The 
most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Axura group than in the 
placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation 
(4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). 
The following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies 
with Axura and since its introduction in the market. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. 
Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-
marketing experience these events have been reported in patients treated with Axura. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing 
experience. 
Symptoms 
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with 
either only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases 
below 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system 
(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination and gait disturbance) 
and/or gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg 
memantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and 
agitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered 
without permanent sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 
400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as 
restlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and 
unconsciousness. 
Treatment 
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or 
overdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric 
lavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, 
forced diuresis should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in 
neurodegenerative dementia. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction. 
Clinical studies 
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe 
Alzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3-14) included 
a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison 
to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based impression of 
change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living 
(ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed 
a statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: 
Alzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 
last observation carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. 
In the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary 
efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) 
from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies 
with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically 
significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. 
When patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a 
statistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated 
patients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, 
p<0.0001). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. 
There is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution 
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to 
150 ng/ml (0.5-1 µmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation 
In man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. 
Main human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 
6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit 
NMDA-antagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within 
20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In 
volunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m² and part 
of total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The 
renal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to 
9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore 
to a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
Linearity 
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) 
of memantine, which is 0.5 µmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal 
vacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum 
concentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the 
effects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but 
not in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not 
disclose any ocular changes. 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was 
observed in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic 
properties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed 
in lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these 
findings is unknown. 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in 
rats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on 
fertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly 
higher than at human exposure.

6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Do not store above 30ºC. 
The bottle with the mounted pump may only be kept and transported in a vertical position. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
50 ml (and 10 x 50 ml) in brown glass bottles (Hydrolytic Class II) and 100 ml in brown glass bottles 
(Hydrolytic Class III). 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
No special requirements. 
Prior to first use the dosing pump has to be screwed on the bottle. For removing the screw cap from 
the bottle the cap must be turned anticlockwise and unscrewed completely (fig. 1). 
Mounting the dosing pump on the bottle: 
The dosing pump has to be removed from the plastic bag (fig. 2) and placed on top of the bottle, 
sliding the plastic dip tube carefully into the bottle. Then the dosing pump needs to be hold onto the 
neck of the bottle and screwed clockwise until it is firmly attached (fig 3). For the intended use the 
dosing pump is only screwed on once when starting the use, and should never be unscrewed. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of the dosing pump for dispensing: 
The dosing pump head has two positions and is easy to turn – anticlockwise (unlocked position) and 
clockwise (locked position). The dosing pump head should not be pushed down while in the locked 
position. The solution may only be dispensed in the unlocked position. To do this, the dosing pump 
head has to be turned in the direction of the arrow about one eighth of a turn, until a resistance is felt 
(fig. 4). 
The dosing pump is then ready for use. 
Preparing the dosing pump: 
When used for the first time, the dosing pump does not dispense the correct amount of oral solution. 
Therefore, the pump must be prepared (primed) by pushing the dosing pump head down completely 
five times in succession (fig. 5). 
The solution thus dispensed is discarded. The next time the dosing pump head is pushed downwards 
completely (equivalent to one pump actuation), it dispenses the correct dose (1 pump actuation is 
equivalent to 0.5 ml oral solution, and contains 5 mg of the active substance memantine hydrochloride; 
fig. 6). 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Correct use of the dosing pump: 
The bottle should be placed on a flat, horizontal surface, for example a table top, and only use it in a 
vertical position.. A glass with a little water or a spoon should be hold below the nozzle and the dosing 
pump head has to be pushed down in a firm but calm and steady manner (not too slowly) right down to 
the stop (fig. 7, fig. 8). 
The dosing pump head can then be released and is ready for the next pump actuation. 
The dosing pump may only be used with the memantine hydrochloride solution in the bottle provided, 
not for other substances or containers. If the pump does not function as described during intended use 
and according to instruction, the patient should consult the treating physician or a pharmacist. The 
dosing pump should be locked after use.

Content of the pack and other information 
1.  What Axura is and what it is used for 
How does Axura work 
Axura contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. 
Axura belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve 
signals important in learning and memory. Axura belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-
receptor antagonists. Axura acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve 
signals and the memory. 
What is Axura used for 
Axura is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Axura

if you have a history of epileptic seizures 
-

In these situations the treatment should be carefully supervised, and the clinical benefit of Axura 
reassessed by your doctor on a regular basis. 
If you suffer from renal impairment (kidney problems), your doctor should closely monitor your 
kidney function and if necessary adapt the memantine doses accordingly.

Instruction for proper use of the pump 
The solution must not be poured or pumped directly into the mouth from the bottle or pump. Measure 
the dose onto a spoon or into a glass of water, using the pump. 
Take the screw cap off the bottle: 
The cap must be turned anticlockwise, unscrewed completely and removed (fig. 1). 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mounting the dosing pump on the bottle: 
Take the dosing pump out of the plastic bag (fig. 2) and place it on top of the bottle. Slide the plastic 
dip tube carefully into the bottle. Hold the dosing pump onto the neck of the bottle and screw it 
clockwise until it fits firmly (fig. 3). The dosing pump is only screwed on once when starting the use, 
and should never be unscrewed. 
How the dosing pump works: 
The dosing pump head has two positions and is easy to turn: 
- 
anticlockwise to unlock and  
clockwise to lock. 
- 
The dosing pump head should not be pushed down while in the locked position. The solution may only 
be dispensed in the unlocked position. To unlock, turn the pump head in the direction of the arrow 
until it cannot be turned any further (about one eighth of a turn, fig. 4). The dosing pump is then ready 
for use. 
Preparing the dosing pump: 
When used for the first time, the dosing pump does not dispense the correct amount of oral solution. 
Therefore, the pump must be prepared (primed) by pushing the dosing pump head down completely 
five times in succession (fig. 5). 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The solution thus dispensed is discarded. The next time the dosing pump head is pushed downwards 
completely (equivalent to one pump actuation), it dispenses the correct dose (fig. 6). 
Correct use of the dosing pump: 
Place the bottle on a flat, horizontal surface, for example a table top, and only use it in a upright 
position. Hold a glass with a little water or a spoon below the nozzle. Push down the dosing pump 
head in a firm but calm and steady manner - not too slowly (fig. 7, fig. 8). 
The dosing pump head can then be released and is ready for the next pump actuation. 
The dosing pump must only be used with the Axura solution in the bottle provided, not for other 
substances or containers. If the pump does not function properly, consult your doctor or a 
pharmacist.Lock the dosing pump after using Axura.

Content of the pack and other information 
1.  What Axura is and what it is used for 
How does Axura work 
Axura contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. 
Axura belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve 
signals important in learning and memory. Axura belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-
receptor antagonists. Axura acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve 
signals and the memory. 
What is Axura used for 
Axura is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Axura 
Do not take Axura 
- 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to memantine hydrochloride or any of the other ingredients 
of Axura tablets (listed in section 6). 
Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Axura 
if you have a history of epileptic seizures 
-

In these situations the treatment should be carefully supervised, and the clinical benefit of Axura 
reassessed by your doctor on a regular basis. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you suffer from renal impairment (kidney problems), your doctor should closely monitor your 
kidney function and if necessary adapt the memantine doses accordingly. 
The use of medicinal products called amantadine (for the treatment of Parkinson´s disease), ketamine 
(a substance generally used as an anaesthetic), dextromethorphan (generally used to treat cough) and 
other NMDA-antagonists at the same time should be avoided. 
Children and adolescents

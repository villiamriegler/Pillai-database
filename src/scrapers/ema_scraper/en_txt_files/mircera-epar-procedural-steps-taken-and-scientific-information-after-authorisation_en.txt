are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include the 
ADR ‘Stevens Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal 
necrolysis’ under post-marketing experience, 
following the assessment of LEG 037. Further, 
section 4.8 has been revised in accordance with the 
current EU SmPC guidance to include a single table 
with adverse events from clinical studies and adverse 
reactions reported post-marketing. Furthermore, 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated, upon request by PRAC following the 
assessment of LEG 032, to include an agreed class 
wording related to the risk of high cumulative doses 
in patients not responding to the treatment. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

been performed in chronic renal failure patients (on 
dialysis, not on dialysis, in diabetic and non-diabetic 
patients). A tendency towards increased risk estimates for 
all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
events associated with higher cumulative ESA doses 
independent of the diabetes or dialysis status was 
observed. Patients should be monitored closely to ensure 
that the lowest approved effective dose of MIRCERA is used 
to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia 
whilst maintaining a haemoglobin concentration below or at 
12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). Caution should be exercised with 
escalation of MIRCERA doses in patients with chronic renal 
failure. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to 
epoetins, alternative explanations for the poor response 
should be considered.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
II, Labelling 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of Mircera continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and considers that the benefit/risk profile of 
this medicinal product continues to be favourable. The 
CHMP recommends the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Mircera, subject to the conditions and 
obligations as laid down in Annex II to the Opinion. The 
CHMP recommends that the renewal be granted with 
unlimited validity The MAH is requested to submit yearly 
PSURs unless otherwise specified by the CHMP.

between Mircera and placebo treatment, and that there was 
a lack of first-dose effect in patients in controlled clinical 
trials, an update of the ADVENT safety database showed 44 
events of thrombocytopenia from spontaneous reports and 
uncontrolled post-marketing studies. Therefore the MAH 
proposed to amend section 4.8 of the SmPC to state that a 
clinically relevant reduction in platelet counts is attributable 
to Mircera administration, although the frequency of this 
adverse event is unknown.

absence of ADRs of embolism and thrombosis in the 
Mircera clinical database and considering that frequencies 
based on reporting rates from a spontaneous reporting 
system should not be used to assign frequency categories, 
the MAH has reported "frequency unknown" for embolism

thrombosis as a serious cardiovascular event in section 4.4

SmPC and PL 
As a result of the discussion of the updated risk 
following the completion of a class safety review by 
the PhVWP and the CHMP.  
As a result, CHMP requested to update SmPC section 
4.4 to include more information on pure red cell 
aplasia (PRCA) in patients with hepatitis C treated 
with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin, as well as 
SmPC section 5.1 to include additional data on the 
Cochrane meta-analysis and the effects of epoetins 
in cancer patients. 
Additionally, following the class label text describing 
the Cochrane analysis in section 5.1 the following 
product-specific wording has been implemented: " 
Mircera is not approved for treatment of patients 
with chemotherapy induced anaemia (see section 
4.1), no patiens treated with Mircera were part of 
management plans (RMPs)  and the results of the Cochrane 
meta-analysis it was agreed at the PhVWP/CHMP meeting 
in September 2009 that all MAHs for epoetins should 
submit a type II variation to amend the summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC).  
Information with respect to the results of the Cochrane 
meta-analysis on the effects of epoetins in cancer patients 
and to the occurrence of PRCA in patients with Hepatitis C 
treated with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin should be 
included into the SmPC. 
The amendments of Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been implemented as recommended by the PhVWP / CHMP.  
Additional product specific wording has been implemented  
to section 5.1.

The Patient Leaflet has been amended to reflect  the 
increased risk of thromboembolic events in cancer 
patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin 
and the risk of anaemia worsening in patients treated 
with interferon and ribavirin (e.g. patient with 
hepatitis C). 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

The Patient Leaflet has also been amended to reflect  the

Update of DDPS (Pharmacovigilance) 
DDPS (core version 4.1) in accordance with the current 
Pharmacovigilance guideline. After assessing the

because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess 
mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with 
epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in 
patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively 
high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated 
with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular 
morbidity.  
As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in 
section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only 
if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish 
a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in 
Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk 
balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin 
concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the 
relevant results of the trials triggering the safety review. 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, minor details in the labelling have been 
updated.

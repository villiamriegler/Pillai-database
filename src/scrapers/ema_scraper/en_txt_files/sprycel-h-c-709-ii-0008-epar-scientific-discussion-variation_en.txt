III.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
3.1. 
Introduction 
Sprycel (dasatinib) is a potent inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a 
number  of  other  selected  oncogenic  kinases  including  c-KIT,  ephrin  (EPH)  receptor  kinases,  and 
PDGFβ receptor. The Marketing Authorisation (MA) was granted in November 2006 for the treatment 
of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with resistance or 
intolerance  to  prior  therapy  including  imatinib  mesylate,  and  also  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with 
Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  and  lymphoid  blast 
CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  in  September  2006,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  made 
commitments to provide the final clinical study reports for a number of studies which were ongoing at 
the time (see below). The data submitted refer to Follow-Up Measures 008, 008.1, 009 and 011. As 
these updates provide further information relevant for prescribers, the MAH has submitted the data as 
a part of a variation application to amend the currently approved SPC. 
The  variation  is  based  on  24  months  of  follow-up  data  from  five  phase  2  studies  in  subjects  with 
chronic,  accelerated,  myeloid  blast  and  lymphoid  blast  phases  CML  and  Ph+  ALL  resistant  or 
intolerant  to  imatinib.  The  variation  aims  to  update  the  safety  and  efficacy  sections  in  the  product 
information (i.e. section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1) with the results of these five studies. The Package Leaflet 
has been amended accordingly. 
The studies for which updated data have been received: 
•  CA18005  –  A  open  label  Phase  2  study,  ongoing  in  80  centers  worldwide,  enrollment 
closed.  Testing  70  mg  BID  dasatinib  in  subjects  with  accelerated  phase  CML  resistant  or 
intolerant to imatinib;  
•  CA18006  –  A  open  label  Phase  2  study,  ongoing  in  47  centers  worldwide,  enrollment 
closed.  Testing  70  mg  BID  dasatinib  in  subjects  with  myeloid  blast  phase  CML  resistant  or 
intolerant to imatinib;  
•  CA180013  –  A  open  label  Phase  2  study,  ongoing  in  90  centers  worldwide,  enrollment 
closed.  Testing  70  mg  BID  dasatinib  in  subjects  with  chronic  phase  CML  resistant  or 
intolerant to imatinib;  
•  CA180015  –  A  open  label  Phase  2  study,  ongoing  in  28  centers  worldwide,  enrollment 
closed. Testing 70 mg BID dasatinib in subjects with lymphoid blast phase CML resistant or 
intolerant to imatinib. And; also in Ph+ ALL subjects ongoing in 25 centers worldwide;  
•  CA180017  -  A  Randomised  open  label  Phase  2  study,  ongoing  in  107  centers  worldwide, 
enrollment  closed.  Testing  70  mg  BID  dasatinib  vs.  imatinib  400  mg  BID  in  subjects  with 
chronic phase CML resistant to imatinib 400 mg to 600 mg daily. 
In  this  variation  application  the  data  are  presented  separately  by  phase  of  disease  as  each  phase 
represents a different patient population with different baseline characteristics and prognosis. 
Further, the MAH has updated annex IIB to include a reference to the Pharmacovigilance system 
(version 2.5) and the Risk Management Plan (version 3.0) agreed with the CHMP. In addition, the 
MAH have implemented some minor editorial changes in the SPC and annex II and took the 
opportunity to update the contact details of the local representative for Romania in the Package 
Leaflet.

3.2.  Clinical aspects 
Clinical Efficacy 
As part of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA), the MAH provided efficacy data on 
467  patients  from  four  studies  covering  6  months  of  treatment  and  one  study  covering  3  months  of 
treatment.  In  this  updated  analysis  the  MAH  presents  2  years  of  follow-up  of  the  full  population 
enrolled in the five phase 2 studies (N=865) mentioned above (Table 1A).

Methodology 
In the Phase 2 studies, dasatinib was administered in line with the 70 mg (administered twice daily) 
BID regimen. In all 5 studies, investigators were allowed to escalate doses to achieve better efficacy or 
to  reduce  doses  to  manage  adverse  events.  Efficacy  responses  were  determined  from  haematologic 
values,  bone  marrow  cytology  and  cytogenetics,  and  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  extramedullary 
disease.  All  data  presented  represent  data  collected  from  any  subject  who  received  at  least  a  single 
dose of dasatinib. Response rates were estimated along with their 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs) 
based  on  the  Clopper-Pearson  method.  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  median  time  to  and  duration  of 
response were provided along with their 95% CIs. Duration of treatment is calculated as the time from 
the  first  dose  to  the  last  dose  of  study  drug;  medians  are  presented  for  both  imatinib-resistant  and 
imatinib-intolerant subjects enrolled in the studies. In addition, duration of response is presented for 
both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects enrolled in the studies. 
Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  first  date  of  dosing  until  the  time  disease 
progression  was  first  documented  by  the  investigator  or  death.  Subjects  who  neither  progressed  nor 
died were censored on the date of their last cytogenetic or haematologic assessment. Overall survival 
(OS) time was defined as the first date of dosing until the time of death. Subjects who had not died or 
who were lost to follow-up were censored on the last date on which the subject was known to be alive. 
Major molecular responses (MMR) were assessed in studies CA180017 and CA180013 by RQ-PCR 
determined  as  the  ratio  of  BCR-ABL  copies  to  a  control  gene.  These  ratios  were  expressed  using  a 
standardized methodology initially described in the International Randomized Study of Interferon and 
STI-571  (IRIS)  trial  and  currently  reported  by  an  international  panel  of  experts.  In  brief,  the 
standardized  baseline  or  100%  correspond  to  the  baseline  established  in  the  IRIS  trial.  The  3-log 
reduction or 0.1% on the international scale corresponds to a MMR. 
Molecular  data  were  measured  at  3  laboratories  in  the  EU,  USA  and  Australia.  Each  of  these 
laboratories obtained a conversion factor as described in the application for standardization purpose. 
All results were subsequently converted and expressed according to the “international scale”. 
Molecular data for studies CA180005, CA180006, and CA180015 were not yet available for analysis 
at the time of this submission. The MAH has made a commitment in this regard to provide the 
molecular data for Studies CA180005, CA180006, and CA180015 within agreed timeframes.

Results 
Randomised Phase 2 Study  
Study CA180017 (chronic phase CML) 
The  major  cytogenetic  response  (MCyR)  at  12  weeks  was  the  primary  endpoint  in  this  randomized, 
open-label  study  in  subjects  with  chronic  phase  CML  treated  with  dasatinib  70  mg  BID  or  imatinib 
400  mg  BID.  Secondary  endpoints  were  durability  and  time  to  MCyR,  in  addition  to;  rate,  duration 
and time to complete haematological response (CHR).

Based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  maintained  MCyR  for  1  year 
was  92%  for  dasatinib-treated  subjects  and  74%  for  imatinib-treated  subjects.  The  proportion  of 
patients  who  maintained  MCyR  for  18  months  was  90%  for  dasatinib  and  74%  for  imatinib.  The 
MMR rate at any time prior to crossover was higher for the dasatinib group (29%) compared with the 
imatinib  group  (12%).  Subjects  remained  on  dasatinib  longer  than  those  who  were  treated  with 
imatinib. 
The  design  of  this  study  permitted  cross-over  to  the  alternate  study  drug  in  the  case  of  disease 
progression, lack of response, or adverse events that prevented continuation of the randomized study 
drug. As of the data cut-off, 59 crossed over (39 of 40 from imatinib to dasatinib, and 20 of 50 from 
dasatinib to imatinib). Reasons for crossover from imatinib to dasatinib were: intolerance to imatinib 
(9 subjects), disease progression (8 subjects), lack of response (20 subjects), lack of response/disease 
progression (1 subject), and intolerance/lack of response/disease progression (1 subject). Reasons for 
crossover  from  dasatinib  to  imatinib  included:  intolerance  to  dasatinib  (11  subjects),  disease 
progression (4 subjects), lack of response (4 subjects), and intolerance/disease progression (1 subject). 
Open-label Phase 2 Studies  
Study CA180013 (chronic phase CML) 
In this open label phase 2 study, in subjects with chronic phase CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib, 
the  primary  endpoint  was  MCyR.  The  secondary  endpoints  were  durability  and  time  to  MCyR,  and 
time to CHR.

Among the 387 subjects treated, MCyR was achieved in 62% and CHR was achieved in 91%. Nearly 
half of the subjects who achieved MCyR did so within the first 6 months with most subjects achieving 
MCyR by 1 year. Projected rates of MCyR at 12 and 24 months were 95% and 88%, respectively. A 
higher  proportion  of  imatinib-intolerant  subjects  (74%)  compared  with  imatinib-resistant  subjects 
(35%)  achieved  a  MMR.  In  subjects  with  imatinib  resistant  mutations,  63%  achieved  a  MCyR  to 
dasatinib  and  93%  achieved  a  haematologic  response  to  dasatinib.  Responses  to  dasatinib  were 
durable; only 21 of the 240 subjects with MCyR progressed or died. 
In the current analysis in chronic phase CML with durations of dasatinib exposure up to 30 months, 
response  rates  continued  to  improve  compared  with  the  initial  analysis  (e.g.,  from  45%  to  62%  for 
MCyR and from 33% to 54% for CCyR in study CA180013). Although most cytogenetic responses 
were reported within the first 6 months, responses were achieved subsequently and up to the 2 years of 
follow-up in this analysis. Cytogenetic responses were reported in all subsets of imatinib-resistant and 
imatinib-intolerant  subjects  including  those  who  never  responded  to  imatinib.  Durable  major 
molecular  response  was  reported  with  imatinib-intolerant  subjects  achieving  higher  rates  than  in 
imatinib-resistant  subjects.  Cytogenetic  responses  were  also  reported  in  subjects  with  most  types  of 
BCR/ABL mutations. And finally, these responses were durable with less than 10% of subjects with a 
MCyR losing their response thereby translating into survival benefit (Figure 4.4A). Altogether, third-
line dasatinib generated results superior to second-line imatinib.

Among the 174 subjects treated, OHR was achieved in 80% and MaHR was achieved in 64%. MCyR 
was achieved in 40% of subjects. Most subjects who achieved MaHR did so within the first 6 months 
of treatment. In subjects with imatinib-resistant mutations, 73% achieved a MaHR and 40% achieved a 
MCyR  to  dasatinib.  Responses  to  dasatinib  were  durable;  of  the  112  subjects  with  MaHR,  39  had 
progressed or died. 
In  subjects  with  accelerated  phase  CML,  haematologic  and  cytogenetic  responses  continued  to 
improve over time. CHR, MCyR, and CCyR rates among imatinib-resistant subjects (50%, 40%, and 
33%,  respectively)  approximated  those  achieved  with  imatinib  in  similar,  generally  less  heavily 
pretreated subjects. Responses were durable, improving patient’s disease to chronic phase. The 2-year 
survival  rate  in  subjects  who  failed  imatinib  was  72%,  which  exceeds  the  expected  survival  in 
accelerated  phase  CML  subjects  treated  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Overall,  this  high  clinical 
efficacy confirms evidence of clinical benefit in this population.

was achieved in 34% of subjects. Most subjects who achieved MaHR did so within the first 4 months 
of treatment. In subjects with imatinib-resistant mutations, 31% achieved a MaHR and 29% achieved a 
MCyR to dasatinib. Responses to dasatinib were durable; of the 36 subjects who achieved MaHR, 16 
had progressed or died.

Among the 46 subjects treated, OHR was achieved in 48% and MaHR was achieved in 41%. MCyR 
was achieved in 57% of subjects. Most subjects who achieved MaHR did so within the first 2 months 
of treatment. Of these 19 subjects who achieved MaHR, 12 had progressed or died. 
Subjects  with  blast  phase  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  with  2  years  of  follow-up  continued  to  demonstrate 
benefit  from  dasatinib.  Haematologic  and  cytogenetic  response  rates  were  achieved  by  one-third  or 
more of the subjects and most subjects who achieved a response did so rapidly. Durations of response 
were  shorter  providing  a  limited  long-term  impact  on  survival.  Twelve  subjects  with  myeloid  blast 
phase  CML  were  receiving  dasatinib  at  the  time  of  this  2  year  analysis,  suggesting  that  dasatinib

monotherapy can lead to long-term survival. In addition, subjects who responded to dasatinib became 
candidates for bone marrow transplant.  
MAH’s Summary of Efficacy 
With  2  years  of  follow-up,  subjects  treated  with  dasatinib  achieved  haematologic  and  cytogenetic 
responses in the open-label Phase 2 studies. Dasatinib was active in subjects across all phases of CML 
or Ph+ ALL. Subjects with 1 or more detectable imatinib-resistant mutations achieved haematologic 
and  cytogenetic  responses  upon  treatment  with  dasatinib.  Table  4.3.2B  summarises  key  efficacy 
findings  in  the  efficacy  cohort;  data  are  pooled  across  imatinib-resistant  and  imatinib-intolerant 
subjects.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The overall efficacy database has increased considerably since the submission of the initial MAA.  
The data on dasatinib presented above represent the two year follow-up of treating subjects with CML 
in all phases who were intolerant of or resistant to imatinib. The group of patients were heavily pre-
treated  with  other  chemotherapeutic  agents  and  also  received  stem  cell  reconstitution  beside  the 
imatinib treatment. 
Overall, it can be agreed that considering the fact that haematological and cytogenetic responses are 
commonly  accepted  as  a  surrogate  endpoint  in  the  treatment  of  CML,  these  updated  analyses  with 
longer  follow-up  provide  further  evidence  that  early  haematological  and  cytogenetic  responses 
correlate with a long-term favourable outcome. Dasatinib has shown substantial activity in all subsets 
of patients with CML. 
Dasatinib induces durable MCyR in patients with chronic phase CML who are imatinib-resistant and 
imatinib-intolerant. So far less than 10% have lost their MCyR. As expected the MCyR rate is higher 
in imatinib-intolerant patients than in patients with true imatinib resistance. 
The results in accelerated phase CML patients with imatinib-resistance are impressive. 
Study CA180006 showed that even in late stage CML dasatinib induces haematological and 
cytogenetic responses in patients with prolonged prior exposure to imatinib. High doses of imatinib 
were used in about 50% of the patients before the switch to dasatinib. As expected the duration of 
response is quite short. 
The MAH has made a commitment to provide the molecular data for Studies CA180005, CA180006, 
and CA180015 when available for review by the CHMP.

Clinical Safety 
Background 
In the initial MAA, safety data (with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up) were collected from 511 
subjects  with  leukaemia  from  one  Phase  1  (CA180002)  and  five  Phase  2  studies  (CA180005, 
CA180006, CA180013, CA180015, and CA180017). In the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical programme, 
myelosuppression and fluid retention were the most important toxicities identified in subjects treated 
with dasatinb 70 mg BID. In subjects with chronic phase CML (CA180013 and CA180002), 49% of 
subjects  reported  Grade  3/4  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  and  17%  reported  pleural  effusion 
(Grade 3/4 in 3%). In subjects with advanced phase disease (CA180005, CA180006, and CA180015), 
approximately  80%  of  subjects  reported  Grade  3/4  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  and  28% 
reported  pleural  effusion  (Grade  3/4  in  7%).  Dose  interruptions  and  reductions  were  common  in  all 
studies. 
Whereas  this  submission  is  based  largely  on  the  results  from  2  years  of  follow-up  in  the  Phase  2 
studies  with  865  subjects,  pooled  safety  data  are  also  presented  in  this  document  from  the  overall 
population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects. Data were pooled by disease phase. Limited pooling of 
data  was  determined  to  be  the  best  way  to  assess  drug-producing  adverse  events  (AEs)  because  of 
difficulties in distinguishing disease-related toxicities from drug-related toxicities in advanced phases 
of CML. 
Safety  data  are  presented  for  the  safety  cohort  (all  treated  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
study drug). The safety prognosis for subjects resistant and intolerant to imatinib was expected to be 
similar; therefore, all of the safety analyses combined these 2 groups except for subgroup analyses by 
imatinib status. For study CA180017, safety data prior to crossover were included in the safety cohort. 
In  all  studies,  investigators  were  allowed  to  escalate  subjects’  doses  to  achieve  better  efficacy  or  to 
reduce subjects’ doses to manage  adverse events.  Since none of the studies conducted used a fixed-
dose design (i.e., dose adjustments up and down were permitted) data are not analyzed by dose. Data 
collected from any subject who received at least a single dose of dasatinib are presented. Safety and 
tolerability  were  assessed  through  collection  of  spontaneously  reported  AEs,  measurement  of  vital 
signs,  and  routine  laboratory  testing.  Severity  of  on-study  AEs  was  graded  by  the  investigators 
according  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (NCI 
CTCAE) version 3 grading system. The investigator’s adverse event terms were coded and grouped by 
preferred  term  and  system  organ  class  using  the  MedDRA  dictionary  (version  10.0)  and  were 
summarized by any grade, Grade 3 to 4, and Grade 5 (i.e., death). 
Among  the  865  subjects  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  from  the  Phase  2  studies,  the  median  duration  of 
exposure  was  15.67 months  (range  0.03 - 30.62 months).  The  majority  of  subjects  (71%)  were 
administered  dasatinib  for  more  than  6 months  (Table  5.3A);  313 (36%)  subjects  were  treated  in 
excess of 24 months.

Results  from  the  five  Phase  2  studies  of  dasatinib  treatment  with  2 years  of  follow-up  at  a  dose  of 
70 mg twice daily (BID) were consistent with the safety profile reported in the initial submission with 
3 months of follow-up and in the updated safety analysis with 8 months of follow-up in 911 subjects 
with CML or Ph+ ALL. Adverse events of myelosuppression and fluid retention identified as AEs of 
special interest are further described below. 
Common Drug-related Adverse Events 
Of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, the most frequently reported drug-related 
AEs (≥ 20%) included diarrhoea, pleural effusion, headache, rash, nausea, superficial oedema, fatigue, 
and dyspnoea. While the safety profile of dasatinib in the geriatric population (≥ 65 years of age; 25%) 
was  similar  to  that  in  the  younger  population  (<  65  years  of  age;  75%),  patients  aged  65 years  and 
older  reported  a  higher  incidence  of  some  drug-related  AEs  associated  with  dasatinib  use.  Pleural 
effusion (38% vs. 20%), congestive heart failure (6% vs. 2%), gastrointestinal bleeding (12% vs. 7%), 
fatigue  (26%  vs.  20%),  and  dyspnoea  (34%  vs.  17%)  were  all  greater  in  subjects  > 65 years  of  age 
compared with subjects < 65 years old, respectively. However, the elderly generally report more co-
morbidities  than  the  younger  group,  which  should  be  taken  into  consideration  before  drawing 
conclusions. 
Comparison of Adverse Events by Length of Follow-up 
Overall, the drug-related AEs initially reported with 8 months of follow-up were consistent with those 
reported after 2 years of follow-up in subjects from the 4 non-randomized Phase 2 studies. Most drug-
related AEs showed minimal increases with longer follow-up. Fluid-retention AEs and dyspnoea were 
exceptions.  With  longer  follow-up,  higher  incidence  of  drug-related  pleural  effusion,  pericardial 
effusion,  and  cardiac  congestive  failure/cardiac  dysfunction  was  reported  compared  with  shorter 
(8 month) follow-up. Drug-related dyspnoea increased from 18% to 29% with longer follow-up. 
Drug-related Adverse Events that led to Discontinuation 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation occurring up to 30 days after the last dose were reported 
in 122 (14%) of the 865 subjects in the Phase 2 studies. Most of these discontinuations were reported 
as  AEs  related  to  disease  progression.  Pleural  effusion  accounted  for  discontinuation  in  40  subjects 
with 12 subjects reporting severe (Grade 3-4) pleural effusion. More pleural effusions were reported in 
subjects  with  chronic  phase  CML  (N  =  27)  and  myeloid  blast  CML  (N  =  7)  than  in  the  accelerated 
phase (N = 3), lymphoid blast phase (N = 1), and Ph+ ALL (N = 2).  
Of  the  overall  population  of  2,182  dasatinib-treated  subjects,  drug-related  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were mostly mild to moderate in severity and occurred at a rate of < 1% in any one 
category. Exceptions included pleural effusion (3%; N = 68), congestive heart failure (1%; N = 13), 
dyspnoea (1%; N = 23), and headache (1%; N = 12).

Serious Adverse Events 
Overall,  SAEs  reported  with  2  years  of  follow-up  were  consistent  with  the  initial  submission  of  the 
Phase 2 programme. Drug-related SAEs occurring up to 30 days after the last dose were reported in 
341 (39%) dasatinib-treated subjects. Pleural effusion, thrombocytopenia, and dyspnoea were the most 
common  drug-related  SAEs.  Of  the  overall  population  of  2,182  dasatinib-treated  subjects,  the  most 
frequently reported drug-related SAEs (> 2%) included pleural effusion (10%), GI haemorrhage (4%), 
febrile  neutropenia  (4%),  dyspnoea  (3%),  pyrexia  (3%),  and  pneumonia  (3%).The  majority  of  GI 
haemorrhage,  febrile  neutropenia,  and  pneumonia  events  were  considered  severe.  Fluid  retention, 
myelosuppression, bleeding-related events, and QT interval prolongation are discussed below. 
Deaths 
A total of 175 (22%) subjects died. Of these 175 deaths, 104 occurred within 30 days of the last dose 
of dasatinib. Nearly half of the deaths were due to disease progression with the majority in subjects in 
advanced phases of CML or Ph+ ALL. Infection was the cause of death is 36 (4%) subjects. The rate 
of death due to infection increased with advancing disease phase with Ph+ ALL reporting the highest 
rate.  Cardiovascular  disease  was  the  reason  for  death  in  4  subjects  (acute  heart  failure  [2  subjects], 
arrhythmia/cardiovascular  arrest  [1  subject],  cardiopulmonary  arrest  [1  subject]).  Fatal  bleeding 
occurred in 12 subjects (8 due to cerebral, 2 due to pulmonary, 1 due to gastrointestinal, and 1 listed as 
haemorrhage).  Of  these  12  subjects,  gastrointestinal  bleeding  (CA180013-30-13257)  was  considered 
possibly  related  and  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  bleeding  (CA180013-47-13061)  was  considered 
probably related to study treatment. Death due to study drug toxicity occurred in 4 subjects. Reasons 
for  study  drug  toxicity  in  these  subjects  were  (1 subject  each)  bone  marrow  failure,  intracranial 
hypertension, global cardiac insufficiency, and moderate pleural effusion. 
Four hundred seventy-four of the 2,182 subjects (21.7%) included in this pooled population died; 239 
deaths (11%) occurred within 30 days after administration of the last dose of dasatinib. More than half 
(247 subjects) of the deaths were due to disease. Infection was the cause of death is 94 (4%) subjects. 
Death due to fatal bleeding occurred in 33 (2%) subjects. Death due to study drug toxicity occurred in 
10 (< 1%) subjects.   
Laboratory Abnormalities 
In this heavily pretreated population of subjects, treatment with dasatinib was associated with severe 
(Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. 
There were few clinically meaningful non-haematologic changes in laboratory parameters reported on 
treatment  with  dasatinib  with  2  years  of  follow-up,  a  result  consistent  with  the  initial  Phase  2 
submission.  Of  the  overall  population  of  2,182  dasatinib-treated  subjects,  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  non-
haematologic  laboratory  abnormalities  included  hypophosphaemia  (13%),  hypocalcaemia  (6%), 
elevated SGPT (3%), elevated SGOT (2%), hyperbilirubinaemia (2%), and elevated serum creatinine 
(1%). 
Selected Safety Events 
Safety  issues  of  particular  interest  addressed  in  the  dasatinib  product  information  included  the  AEs 
myelosuppression,  fluid  retention  (pleural  effusion  and  pericardial  effusion),  bleeding-related  events 
and QT prolongation.  
Haematology 
In  the  Phase  2  studies  with  2  years  of  follow-up,  the  occurrence  of  severe  leucopoenia, 
thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  anaemia  were  more  frequent  in  subjects  with  advanced  phase 
CML  or  Ph+  ALL  than  in  chronic  phase  CML.  In  subjects  who  reported  severe  myelosuppression, 
recovery generally occurred following brief (2 to 4 weeks) dose interruptions or reductions. 
In  the  overall  population  of  2,182  dasatinib-treated  subjects,  myelosuppression  occurred  more 
frequently  in  subjects  with  advanced  phase  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  than  in  chronic  phase  CML  (Table 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.5.1).  The  reported  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  haematologic  abnormalities  included  neutropenia  (57.6%), 
thrombocytopenia (56.3%), and anaemia (35.4%). Myelosuppression was generally reversible and was 
usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or dose reduction.

a   The chronic phase data include subjects treated with any dose of dasatinib.  
CTC grades: neutropenia (Grade 3 ≥0.5–1.0 × 109/L, Grade 4 <0.5 × 109/L); thrombocytopenia (Grade 3 ≥10–50 
× 109/L, Grade 4 <10 × 109/L); anaemia (hemoglobin ≥65–80 g/L, Grade 4 <65 g/L). 
Fluid Retention 
In  the  Phase  2  studies  with  2  years  of  follow-up,  drug-related  fluid  retention  was  reported  in  441 
(51%)  subjects,  including  pleural  effusion  in  32%  of  these  subjects.  Severe  pleural  effusion  was 
reported in 9% of subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL. Subjects with lymphoid blast phase CML reported 
fewer events than in the other disease phases; however, subjects with lymphoid blast phase CML had 
the  lowest  median  duration  of  therapy  compared  with  the  other  disease  phases.  Congestive  heart 
failure,  generalized  oedema,  and  pericardial  effusion  accounted  for  a  total  of  16%  of  the  events. 
Congestive heart failure was highest in subjects with chronic phase CML.  
In the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, drug-related fluid retention was reported 
in 855 (39%) subjects, including pleural effusion in 25% of these subjects. Severe pleural effusion was 
reported  in  6%  of  subjects  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL.  There  was  little  difference  in  pleural  effusion 
between  the  disease  phases.  Congestive  heart  failure,  generalized  oedema,  and  pericardial  effusion 
accounted for a total of 10% of the events.  
Bleeding-related Events  
In the Phase 2 studies with 2 years of follow-up, drug-related CNS haemorrhages occurred in 1% of 
subjects receiving dasatinib. Drug-related GI haemorrhage occurred in 10% of subjects. Other cases of 
haemorrhage occurred in 20% of subjects.  
In the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, drug-related CNS haemorrhages occurred 
in 1% of subjects receiving dasatinib. Drug-related GI haemorrhage occurred in 8% of subjects. Other 
cases of haemorrhage occurred in 15% of subjects.   
Cardiovascular Events  
A  comprehensive  evaluation  of  data  from  Phase  2  studies  identified  treatment-emergent  cardiac  or 
vascular  AEs.  In  the  Phase  2  studies  with  2  years  of  follow-up,  drug-related  cardiac  disorders  were 
reported in 141 (16%) subjects. The majority of cardiac events included arrhythmia (5%), congestive 
heart failure/cardiac dysfunction (5%), and pericardial effusion (6%). Most drug-related events were 
mild to moderate with the exception of severe congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, which was 
reported in 24 of the 39 subjects. 
In  the  overall  population  of  2,182  dasatinib-treated  subjects,  drug-related  cardiac  disorders  were 
reported in 250 (11%) subjects. The majority of cardiac events included arrhythmia (3%), congestive 
heart failure/cardiac dysfunction (3%), and pericardial effusion (4%). Most drug-related events were

mild to moderate with the exception of severe congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, which was 
reported in 31 of the 59 subjects. 
QT Prolongation 
In  the  five Phase  2  clinical  trials,  repeated  baseline  and  on-treatment  ECGs  were  obtained  at  pre-
specified  time  points  and  read  centrally  for  865  subjects  receiving  dasatinib  70 mg  BID.  The  mean 
QTc  interval  changes  from  baseline  using  Fridericia’s  method  (QTcF)  were  4  to  6  msec;  the  upper 
95% confidence intervals for all mean changes from baseline were < 7 msec. A total of 5 subjects (< 
1%)  reported  a  QTcF  >  500 msec.  Of  the  2,182 subjects  who  received  dasatinib  in clinical  trials, 18 
had  QTc  prolongation  reported  as  an  adverse  event.  Seventeen  subjects  (< 1%)  reported  a  QTcF 
> 500 msec. 
Pharmacovigilance  
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (version 2.5) as described by the MAH 
fulfils the legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  risk  management  plan  (version  3.0),  which  included  a  risk 
minimisation plan, based on the new safety data from the studies addressed above. All updates have 
been consequential to the 2 year follow-up data submitted. No major changes have been introduced.

Discussion on Clinical Safety 
The data provided represent the safety results after having treated 875 subjects with 70 mg dasatinib 
BID for 2 years. In the Phase 2 studies, most subjects (> 90%) with CML or Ph+ ALL treated with 
dasatinib  reported  at  least  1 drug-related  AE  regardless  of  relationship  to  study drug.  The pattern  of 
drug-related AEs was similar across studies. In general, the most common drug-related AEs (> 20%) 
were  diarrhoea,  pleural  effusion,  dyspnoea,  fatigue,  headache,  nausea,  and  rash.  Severe  (Grade  3-4) 
drug-related  AEs  were  reported  in  511  (59%)  subjects  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL.  Overall,  diarrhoea, 
pleural effusion, and dyspnoea were the most common severe drug-related AEs. 
The  data  following  2  years  of  follow-up  are  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  reported  in  the  initial 
MAA based on 511 subjects and in the updated safety analysis at 8 months on 911 subjects with CML 
or Ph+ ALL. The most frequent AEs were tolerable, and SAEs were managed by dose interruptions or 
dose  reductions.  Non-haematologic  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate.  Incidence  rates  of  fluid  retention-
related  events  (including  pleural  effusion,  congestive  heart  failure,  pericardial  effusion,  pulmonary 
oedema) and of myelosuppression (including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia) continue 
to be of special interest. No new safety issues were identified.

Pharmacovigilance 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH has revised sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of  the SPC in the light of the  2-year data discussed 
above.  
With  reference  to  section  4.4,  the  main  change  relates  to  extended  information  regarding  fluid 
retention in elderly and a corresponding recommendation of close monitoring. Additional information 
detailing the use of anticoagulants, ASA and NSAIDs in some trials has also been included.  
Section 4.8 has undergone a major update as a consequence of the 2 year safety follow-up. Overall, no 
new safety signals occurred during the two years, although as a result of the  exposure, some events 
have been observed  more  frequently, i.e. infection, vomiting, cough and abdominal pain.  Table 3 in 
section  4.8  (ADR  reported  ≥  5%  in  clinical  trials)  has  thus  been  updated  accordingly.  Further,  the 
sections addressing ADRs at a frequency of < 5% have been amended but no new events have been 
added; the existing ADRs have just been re-categorised.  
A new table 4 has been introduced in section 4.8 replacing the previous text in order to provide clearer 
information about the haematological abnormalities observed in the clinical studies.  
In  section  5.1  the  description  of  the  trials  have  been  updated  and  also  table  5  (former  table  4)  as  a 
consequence.  
As  for  the  Package  Leaflet  relevant  changes  have  been  inserted.  The  MAH  has  submitted  a 
justification  for  not  having  performed  another  consultation  with  target  groups  when  amending  the 
Package Leaflet. Their main justifications are that the initial Package Leaflet was tested in 2006, and 
the update aims at amending the efficacy and safety sections only. Also, in their view, the changes to 
the Package Leaflet are not of a major character, which can be agreed. Thus, no new readability testing 
is considered necessary.  
Further, the MAH has updated annex IIB to include a reference to the Pharmacovigilance system 
(version 2.5) and the Risk Management Plan (version 3.0) agreed with the CHMP. In addition, the 
MAH have implemented some minor editorial changes in the SPC and annex II and took the 
opportunity to update the contact details of the local representative for Romania in the Package 
Leaflet. All these changes are acceptable. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Dasatinib is a therapeutic advance for subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant 
to imatinib. Updated results from the finalised dasatinib Phase 2 programme showed that subjects with 
all  phases  of  CML  or  Ph+ ALL  achieve  durable  haematologic  and  cytogenetic  responses. 
Myelosuppression and fluid retention were identified as the most important toxicities in the Phase 1 
and Phase 2 studies and are still considered as events of major interest.  
The  MAH  has  forwarded  an  updated  Risk  Management  Plan  which  is  considered  acceptable.  The 
CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(cid:131) 
no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
The MAH has updated annex IIB to reflect the latest Pharmacovigilance system (version 2.5) and Risk 
Management Plan (version 3.0) approved by the CHMP, which is acceptable. 
The proposed update of the SPC and Package Leaflet is agreed based on the submitted 2 year follow 
up  data  from  the  five  phase  II  studies  performed  in  subjects  with  various  forms  of  leukaemia, 
confirming the results seen in the initial MAA which the current approval is based on.  
IV.  CONCLUSION 
-  On 30 May 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) patients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or with 
CKD on dialysis. 
Velphoro should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include 
calcium supplement, 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 or one of its analogues, or calcimimetics to control 
the development of renal bone disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Starting dose for adults and adolescents (≥12 years of age) 
The recommended starting dose is 1,500 mg iron (3 tablets) per day, divided across the meals of the 
day.   
Titration and maintenance for adults and adolescents (≥12 years of age) 
Serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide up or down 
titrated in increments of 500 mg iron (1 tablet) per day every 2 – 4 weeks until an acceptable serum 
phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring afterwards. 
In clinical practice, treatment will be based on the need to control serum phosphorus levels, though 
patients who respond to Velphoro therapy usually achieve optimal serum phosphorus levels at doses of 
1,500 – 2,000 mg iron per day (3 to 4 tablets). 
If one or more doses are missed, the normal dose of the medicinal product should be resumed with the 
next meal.

Maximum tolerated daily dose for adults and adolescents (≥12 years of age)  
The maximum recommended dose is 3,000 mg iron (6 tablets). 
Starting dose, titration and maintenance for paediatric patients (2 to <12 years of age) 
Velphoro is also available as 125 mg oral powder in sachet for use in paediatric patients 2 to <12 years 
of age. The choice of the formulation depends on patient’s age, preference, characteristics and 
compliance. When transitioning between formulations, the same recommended dose should be used. 
Recommended starting doses and dose titrations of Velphoro for paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of 
age are shown in the Table 1.

For patients 2 to <6 years of age oral powder should be administered, as the chewable tablet 
formulation is not appropriate for this age group.  
For patients 6 to <12 years of age Velphoro chewable tablets may be prescribed instead of or in 
combination with Velphoro oral powder in case the daily dose is 1,000 mg iron (2 chewable tablets) or 
more. 
Serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide up or down 
titrated in increments per day every 2 – 4 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached, 
with regular monitoring afterwards. 
Paediatric population <2 years of age 
The safety and efficacy of Velphoro in children below the age of 2 years has not been established. No 
data are available. 
Renal impairment 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult CKD patients on HD or PD. 
There is no clinical data available in patients with earlier stages of renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from participating in clinical studies with 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide. However, no evidence of hepatic impairment or significant alteration of 
hepatic enzymes were observed in the clinical studies with sucroferric oxyhydroxide. See further 
information in section 4.4. 
Elderly population (≥65 years of age) 
Velphoro has been administered to over 248 seniors (≥65 years of age) according to the approved 
dosing regimen. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, 29.7% 
were aged 65 years and over, while 8.7% were aged 75 years and over. No special dose and 
administration guidelines were applied to seniors in these studies and the dosing schedules were not 
associated with any significant concerns.

Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Velphoro is a chewable tablet that must be taken with meals. In order to maximise the adsorption of 
dietary phosphate, the total daily dose should be divided across the meals of the day. Patients are not 
required to drink more fluid than they normally would and should adhere to their prescribed diets. 
Tablets must be chewed or crushed; tablets must not be swallowed whole. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Haemochromatosis and any other iron accumulation disorders. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Peritonitis, gastric and hepatic disorders and gastrointestinal surgery 
Patients with a recent history of peritonitis (within the last 3 months), significant gastric or hepatic 
disorders and patients with major gastrointestinal surgery have not been included in clinical studies 
with Velphoro. Velphoro treatment should only be used in these patients following careful assessment 
of benefit/risk. 
Discoloured stool 
Sucroferric oxyhydroxide can cause discoloured (black) stool. Discoloured (black) stool may visually 
mask gastrointestinal bleeding (see section 4.5). 
Information about sucrose and starches (carbohydrates) 
Velphoro contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-
galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product. 
It may be harmful to the teeth. 
Velphoro contains potato starch and pregelatinised maize starch. Patients with diabetes should take 
notice that one tablet of Velphoro is equivalent to approximately 1.4 g of carbohydrates (equivalent to 
0.116 bread units). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Velphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although the potential for interactions 
with medicinal products seems low, for concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic window, the clinical effect and adverse events should be monitored, on initiation or dose-
adjustment of either Velphoro or the concomitant medicinal product, or the physician should consider 
measuring blood levels. When administering any medicinal product that is already known to interact 
with iron (like alendronate and doxycycline) or has the potential to interact with sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide based only on in vitro studies like levothyroxine, the medicinal product should be 
administered at least one hour before or two hours after Velphoro. 
In vitro studies with the following active substances did not show any relevant interaction: 
acetylsalicylic acid, cephalexin, cinacalcet, ciprofloxacin, clopidogrel, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, 
metformin, metoprolol, nifedipine, pioglitazone and quinidine. 
Interaction studies have only been performed in healthy volunteers. They have been conducted in 
healthy human male and female subjects with losartan, furosemide, digoxin, warfarin, and omeprazole. 
Concomitant administration of Velphoro did not affect the bioavailability of these medicinal products 
as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data from clinical studies have shown that sucroferric oxyhydroxide does not affect the lipid lowering 
effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin and simvastatin). In addition, post-hoc 
analyses from clinical studies demonstrated no impact of Velphoro on iPTH lowering effect of oral 
Vitamin D analogues. Vitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D levels remained unchanged. 
Velphoro does not affect guaiac based (Haemoccult) or immunological based (iColo Rectal and 
Hexagon Obti) faecal occult blood tests. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no available clinical data from the use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide on exposed human 
pregnancies. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals revealed no risk with respect to 
pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). 
Sucroferric oxyhydroxide should only be used by pregnant women if clearly needed following careful 
assessment of benefit/risk. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no available clinical data from the use of Velphoro in breast-feeding women. Since 
absorption of iron from this medicinal product is minimal (see section 5.2), excretion of iron from 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide in breast milk is unlikely. A decision on whether to continue breast-feeding 
or to continue therapy with sucroferric oxyhydroxide should be made taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Velphoro therapy to the mother. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of Velphoro on fertility in humans. In animal studies, there were no 
adverse effects on mating performance, fertility, and litter parameters following treatment with 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Velphoro has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The current safety profile of Velphoro is based on a total of 778 patients on haemodialysis and 
57 patients on peritoneal dialysis, who received sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment of up to 55 weeks. 
In these clinical trials, approximately 43% of the patients experienced at least one adverse reaction 
during Velphoro treatment, and 0.36% of the adverse reactions were reported as serious. The majority 
of the adverse reactions reported from trials were gastrointestinal disorders, with the most frequently 
reported adverse reactions being diarrhoea and discoloured faeces (very common). The vast majority 
of these gastrointestinal disorders occurred early during treatment and abated with time with continued 
dosing. No dose-dependent trends were observed in the adverse reaction profile of Velphoro. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported from the use of Velphoro at doses from 250 mg iron/day to 3,000 mg 
iron/day in these patients (n=835) are listed in Table 2. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reporting rate is classified as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
*Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea occurred in 11.6% of patients in clinical trials. In the 55 weeks long term studies, the 
majority of these diarrhoea adverse reactions were transient, occurred early during treatment 
initiation and led to treatment discontinuation in 3.1% of the patients. 
Paediatric population 
In general, the safety profile of Velphoro in paediatric (2 to <18 years of age) and adult patients was 
comparable. The adverse reactions most frequently reported were gastrointestinal disorders including 
diarrhoea (very common, 16.7%), vomiting (common, 6.1%), gastritis (common, 3.0%) and 
discoloured faeces (common, 3.0%).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Any instances of overdose of Velphoro (e.g. hypophosphataemia) should be treated by standard 
clinical practice.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products; drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and 
hyperphosphataemia; ATC code: V03AE05 
Mechanism of action 
Velphoro contains sucroferric oxyhydroxide which is comprised of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide 
(pn-FeOOH), sucrose and starches. Phosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange between 
hydroxyl groups and/or water and the phosphate ions throughout the physiological pH range of the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
Serum phosphorus levels are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption. 
Clinical efficacy 
One phase 3 clinical study has been performed in patients with CKD on dialysis to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of Velphoro in this population. This study was an open-label, randomised, active-
controlled (sevelamer carbonate), parallel group study for up to 55 weeks. Adult patients with 
hyperphosphataemia (serum phosphorus levels ≥1.94 mmol/L) were treated with sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide at a starting dose of 1,000 mg iron/day followed by an 8 week dose titration period. 
Non-inferiority to sevelamer carbonate was determined at week 12. Subjects were continued on their 
study medication from week 12 to week 55. From week 12 to 24, dose titrations were allowed for both 
tolerability and efficacy reasons. Treatment of patient sub-populations from week 24 to week 27 with 
maintenance dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide (1,000 to 3,000 mg iron/day) or low dose (250 mg 
iron/day) of sucroferric oxyhydroxide demonstrated superiority of the maintenance dose. 
In Study-05A, 1,055 patients on haemodialysis (N=968) or peritoneal dialysis (N=87) with serum 
phosphorus ≥1.94 mmol/L following a 2 – 4 week phosphate binder washout period, were randomised 
and treated with either sucroferric oxyhydroxide, at a starting dose of 1,000 mg iron/day (N=707), or 
active-control (sevelamer carbonate, N=348) for 24 weeks. At the end of week 24, 93 patients on 
haemodialysis whose serum phosphorus levels were controlled (<1.78 mmol/L) with sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide in the first part of the study, were re-randomised to continue treatment with either their 
week 24 maintenance dose (N=44 or a non-effective low dose control 250 mg iron/day, N=49) of 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide for a further 3 weeks. 
Following completion of Study-05A, 658 patients (597 on haemodialysis and 61 on peritoneal 
dialysis) were treated in the 28 week extension study (Study-05B) with either sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide (N=391) or sevelamer carbonate (N=267) according to their original randomization. 
Mean serum phosphorus levels were 2.5 mmol/L at baseline and 1.8 mmol/L at week 12 for 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L). Corresponding levels for sevelamer carbonate at 
baseline were 2.4 mmol/L and 1.7 mmol/L at week 12 (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L), respectively. 
The serum phosphorus reduction was maintained over 55 weeks. Serum phosphorus levels and 
calcium-phosphorus product levels were reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate 
absorption. 
The response rates, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving serum phosphorus levels within the 
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommended range were 45.3% and 59.1% at 
week 12 and 51.9% and 55.2% at week 52, for sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer carbonate, 
respectively. 
The mean daily dose of Velphoro over 55 weeks of treatment was 1,650 mg iron and the mean daily 
dose of sevelamer carbonate was 6,960 mg.

Post-authorisation data 
A prospective, non-interventional, post-authorisation safety study (VERIFIE) has been conducted, 
evaluating the short- and long-term (up to 36 months) safety and effectiveness of Velphoro in adult 
patients on haemodialysis (N=1,198) or peritoneal dialysis (N=160), who were followed in routine 
clinical practice for 12 to 36 months (safety analysis set, N=1,365). During the study, 45% (N=618) of 
these patients were concomitantly treated with phosphate binder(s) other than Velphoro. 
In the safety analysis set, the most common ADRs were diarrhoea and discoloured faeces, reported by 
14% (N=194) and 9% (N=128) of patients, respectively. The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in the 
first week and decreased with duration of use. Diarrhoea was of mild to moderate intensity in most 
patients and resolved in the majority of patients within 2 weeks. Discoloured (black) faeces is expected 
for an oral iron-based compound, and may visually mask gastrointestinal bleeding. For 4 of the 40 
documented concomitant gastrointestinal bleeding events, Velphoro-related stool discolouration was 
reported as causing an insignificant delay in diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, without affecting 
patient health. In the remaining cases, no delay in diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding has been 
reported. 
The results from this study showed that the effectiveness of Velphoro in a real-life setting (including 
concomitant use of other phosphate binders in 45% of patients), was in line with that observed in the 
phase 3 clinical study. 
Paediatric population 
An open label clinical study investigated the efficacy and safety of Velphoro in paediatric patients 2 
years of age and older with CKD, and hyperphosphatemia (CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min/l .73 m²) or with CKD on dialysis). Eighty-five subjects were  randomised 
to Velphoro  (N=66) or active control calcium acetate arm (N=19) for a 10-week dose titration (Stage 
1), followed by a 24-week safety extension (Stage 2). Most patients were ≥12 years of age (66%). 
Eighty percent of patients were CKD patients on dialysis (67% on haemodialysis and 13% on 
peritoneal dialysis) and 20% were CKD patients not on dialysis. 
The limited difference in reduction in mean serum phosphorus level from baseline to the end of Stage 
1 in the Velphoro group (N=65) was not statistically significant with -0.120 (0.081) mmol/L (95% CI: 
-0.282, 0.043) based on the mixed model calculations with actual data showing a mean of 2.08 
mmol/L at baseline and 1.91 mmol/L at the end of Stage 1 (reduction by 0.17 mmol/L). The effect was 
maintained during Stage 2, although some fluctuations in mean effect over time were noticed (0.099 
(0.198) mmol/L (95% CI: -0.306, 0.504)). 
The percentage of subjects with serum phosphorus levels within normal ranges increased from 37% at 
baseline to 61% at the end of Stage 1, and was 58% at the end of Stage 2, showing the sustainable 
phosphorus lowering effect of sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Among subjects whose serum phosphorus 
was above age-related normal ranges at baseline (N=40), serum phosphorus levels showed statistically 
significant decrease from baseline to the end of Stage 1, with the LS mean (SE) change -0.87 (0.30) 
mg/dL (95% CI: -1.47, -0.27; p=0.006). 
The safety profile of Velphoro in paediatric patients was generally comparable to that previously 
observed in adult patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Velphoro works by binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the serum concentration is 
not relevant for its efficacy. Due to the insolubility and degradation characteristics of Velphoro, no 
classical pharmacokinetic studies can be carried out, e.g., determination of the distribution volume, 
area under the curve, mean residence time, etc. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2 Phase 1 studies, it was concluded that the potential for iron overload is minimal and no dose 
dependent effects were observed in healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
The active moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is practically insoluble and therefore not absorbed. Its 
degradation product, mononuclear iron species, can however be released from the surface of pn-
FeOOH and be absorbed. 
The absolute absorption studies in humans were not performed. Non-clinical studies in several species 
(rats and dogs) showed that systemic absorption was very low (≤1% of the administered dose). 
The iron uptake from radiolabelled Velphoro active substance, 2,000 mg iron in 1 day was investigated 
in 16 CKD patients (8 pre-dialysis and 8 haemodialysis patients) and 8 healthy volunteers with low 
iron stores (serum ferritin <100 mcg/L). In healthy subjects, the median uptake of radiolabelled iron in 
the blood was estimated to be 0.43% (range 0.16 – 1.25%) on day 21, in pre-dialysis patients 0.06% 
(range 0.008 – 0.44%) and in haemodialysis patients 0.02% (range 0 – 0.04%). Blood levels of 
radiolabelled iron were very low and confined to the erythrocytes. 
Distribution 
The distribution studies in humans were not performed. Non-clinical studies in several species (rats 
and dogs) showed that pn-FeOOH is distributed from the plasma to the liver, spleen and bone marrow, 
and utilized by incorporation into red blood cells. 
In patients, absorbed iron is expected to be also distributed to the target organs, i.e. liver, spleen and 
bone marrow, and utilized by incorporation into red blood cells. 
Biotransformation 
The active moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is not metabolised. However, the degradation product of 
Velphoro, mononuclear iron species, can be released from the surface of polynuclear iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide and be absorbed. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the systemic absorption of iron 
from Velphoro is low. 
In vitro data suggest that the sucrose and starch components of the active substance can be digested to 
glucose and fructose, and maltose and glucose, respectively. These compounds can be absorbed in the 
blood. 
Elimination 
In animal studies with rats and dogs administered 59Fe-Velphoro active substance orally, radiolabelled 
iron was recovered in the faeces but not the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects seen in the rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study (skeletal variations and incomplete 
ossificaton) are related to exaggerated pharmacology, and likely not relevant for patients. Other 
reproduction toxicity studies showed no adverse effects. 
Carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats. There was no clear evidence of a 
carcinogenic effect in mice. Mucosal hyperplasia, with diverticulum/cyst formation was observed in 
the colon and caecum of mice after 2 years treatment, but this was considered a species-specific effect 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with no diverticula/cysts seen in long term studies in rats or dogs. In rats, there was a slightly increased 
incidence of benign C cell adenoma in the thyroid of male rats given the highest dose of sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide. This is thought to be most likely an adaptive response to the pharmacological effect of 
the medicinal product, and not clinically relevant.

Serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide up or down 
titrated once per two weeks by adjusting the daily dose as indicated in Table 1 until an acceptable 
serum phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring afterwards.  
For patients 6 to <12 years of age Velphoro chewable tablets may be prescribed instead of or in 
combination with Velphoro oral powder in case the daily dose is 1,000 mg iron (2 chewable tablets) or 
more. 
If one or more doses are missed, the normal dose of the medicinal product should be resumed with the 
next meal. 
Additional formulation and strength available 
Velphoro is also available as chewable tablets (500 mg iron) for use in adult and paediatric patients 
6 years of age and older. The choice of the formulation depends on patient’s age, preference, 
characteristics and compliance. When transitioning between formulations, the same recommended 
dose should be used. Velphoro oral powder was not studied in adults. For patients 2 to <6 years of age 
oral powder should be administered as chewable tablet formulation is not appropriate for this age 
group. 
Paediatric population <2 years of age 
The safety and efficacy of Velphoro in children below the age of 2 years has not been established. No 
data are available. 
Renal impairment 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult CKD patients on HD or PD. 
There is no clinical data available in patients with earlier stages of renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from participating in clinical studies with 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide. However, no evidence of hepatic impairment or significant alteration of 
hepatic enzymes were observed in the clinical studies with sucroferric oxyhydroxide. See further 
information in section 4.4. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
In order to maximise the adsorption of dietary phosphate, the total daily dose (total number of sachets) 
should be divided across the main meals of the day, i.e. meals with the highest phosphate content. 
When total number of sachets cannot be equally divided by the number of main meals, rest of the dose 
should be taken with one or two main meals. The optimal way to give the total daily dose of Velphoro 
to individual patients should be decided based on their feeding regimens. 
Before administration, Velphoro oral powder should be mixed with a small amount of soft food (such 
as apple sauce) or with non-carbonated beverage or water and taken with meals. Each sachet of oral 
powder requires minimum 5 mL of liquid for suspension, e.g. 2 sachets shall be suspended in 
minimum 10 mL. The amount of liquid could be increased if total daily fluid intake remains in line 
with dietary instructions for individual patient. 
Patients should take Velphoro oral powder within 30 minutes after being suspended. Velphoro oral 
powder should not be heated (e.g. in a microwave) or added to heated food or liquids. The mixture 
should be stirred vigorously as the powder will not dissolve completely and remain in suspension with 
a red-brown colour. If necessary, the suspension should be resuspended right before administration.  
The prescribed dose of Velphoro oral powder suspended in water as described above, may be 
administered via an enteral feeding tube >6 FR (French catheter scale). Follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions for the feeding tube to administer the medicinal product. To ensure adequate dosing, after 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration of the oral suspension, the enteral feeding tube must be flushed with water. See section 
6.6 for further details. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Haemochromatosis and any other iron accumulation disorders. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Peritonitis, gastric and hepatic disorders and gastrointestinal surgery 
Patients with a recent history of peritonitis (within the last 3 months), significant gastric or hepatic 
disorders and patients with major gastrointestinal surgery have not been included in clinical studies 
with Velphoro. Velphoro treatment should only be used in these patients following careful assessment 
of benefit/risk. 
Discoloured stool 
Sucroferric oxyhydroxide can cause discoloured (black) stool. Discoloured (black) stool may visually 
mask gastrointestinal bleeding (see section 4.5). 
Information about sucrose and starches (carbohydrates) 
Velphoro contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-
galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product. 
It may be harmful to the teeth. 
Velphoro contains potato starch and pregelatinised maize starch. Patients with diabetes should take 
notice that one sachet of Velphoro oral powder is equivalent to approximately 0.7 g of carbohydrates 
(equivalent to 0.056 bread units). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Velphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although the potential for interactions 
with medicinal products seems low, for concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic window, the clinical effect and adverse events should be monitored, on initiation or dose-
adjustment of either Velphoro or the concomitant medicinal product, or the physician should consider 
measuring blood levels. When administering any medicinal product that is already known to interact 
with iron (like alendronate and doxycycline) or has the potential to interact with sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide based only on in vitro studies like levothyroxine, the medicinal product should be 
administered at least one hour before or two hours after Velphoro. 
In vitro studies with the following active substances did not show any relevant interaction: 
acetylsalicylic acid, cephalexin, cinacalcet, ciprofloxacin, clopidogrel, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, 
metformin, metoprolol, nifedipine, pioglitazone and quinidine. 
Interaction studies have only been performed in healthy volunteers. They have been conducted in 
healthy human male and female subjects with losartan, furosemide, digoxin, warfarin, and omeprazole. 
Concomitant administration of Velphoro did not affect the bioavailability of these medicinal products 
as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). 
Data from clinical studies have shown that sucroferric oxyhydroxide does not affect the lipid lowering 
effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin and simvastatin). In addition, post-hoc 
analyses from clinical studies demonstrated no impact of Velphoro on iPTH lowering effect of oral 
Vitamin D analogues. Vitamin D and 1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D levels remained unchanged. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Velphoro does not affect guaiac based (Haemoccult) or immunological based (iColo Rectal and 
Hexagon Obti) faecal occult blood tests. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no available clinical data from the use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide on exposed human 
pregnancies. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals revealed no risk with respect to 
pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). 
Sucroferric oxyhydroxide should only be used by pregnant women if clearly needed following careful 
assessment of benefit/risk. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no available clinical data from the use of Velphoro in breast-feeding women. Since 
absorption of iron from this medicinal product is minimal (see section 5.2), excretion of iron from 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide in breast milk is unlikely. A decision on whether to continue breast-feeding 
or to continue therapy with sucroferric oxyhydroxide should be made taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Velphoro therapy to the mother. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of Velphoro on fertility in humans. In animal studies, there were no 
adverse effects on mating performance, fertility, and litter parameters following treatment with 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Velphoro has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The current safety profile of Velphoro is based on a total of 778 patients on haemodialysis and 
57 patients on peritoneal dialysis, who received sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment of up to 55 weeks. 
In these clinical trials, approximately 43% of the patients experienced at least one adverse reaction 
during Velphoro treatment, and 0.36% of the adverse reactions were reported as serious. The majority 
of the adverse reactions reported from trials were gastrointestinal disorders, with the most frequently 
reported adverse reactions being diarrhoea and discoloured faeces (very common). The vast majority 
of these gastrointestinal disorders occurred early during treatment and abated with time with continued 
dosing. No dose-dependent trends were observed in the adverse reaction profile of Velphoro. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported from the use of Velphoro at doses from 250 mg iron/day to 3,000 mg 
iron/day in these patients (n=835) are listed in Table 2. 
The reporting rate is classified as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
*Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea occurred in 11.6% of patients in clinical trials. In the 55 weeks long term studies, the 
majority of these diarrhoea adverse reactions were transient, occurred early during treatment 
initiation and led to treatment discontinuation in 3.1% of the patients. 
Paediatric population 
In general, the safety profile of Velphoro in paediatric (2 to <18 years of age) and adult patients was 
comparable. The adverse reactions most frequently reported were gastrointestinal disorders including 
diarrhoea (very common, 16.7%), vomiting (common, 6.1%), gastritis (common, 3.0%) and 
discoloured faeces (common, 3.0%).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Any instances of overdose of Velphoro (e.g. hypophosphataemia) should be treated by standard 
clinical practice.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products; drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and 
hyperphosphataemia; ATC code: V03AE05 
Mechanism of action 
Velphoro contains sucroferric oxyhydroxide which is comprised of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide 
(pn-FeOOH), sucrose and starches. Phosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange between 
hydroxyl groups and/or water and the phosphate ions throughout the physiological pH range of the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
Serum phosphorus levels are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption. 
Clinical efficacy 
One phase 3 clinical study has been performed in patients with CKD on dialysis to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of Velphoro in this population. This study was an open-label, randomised, active-
controlled (sevelamer carbonate), parallel group study for up to 55 weeks. Adult patients with 
hyperphosphataemia (serum phosphorus levels ≥1.94 mmol/L) were treated with sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide at a starting dose of 1,000 mg iron/day followed by an 8 week dose titration period. 
Non-inferiority to sevelamer carbonate was determined at week 12. Subjects were continued on their 
study medication from week 12 to week 55. From week 12 to 24, dose titrations were allowed for both 
tolerability and efficacy reasons. Treatment of patient sub-populations from week 24 to week 27 with 
maintenance dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide (1,000 to 3,000 mg iron/day) or low dose (250 mg 
iron/day) of sucroferric oxyhydroxide demonstrated superiority of the maintenance dose. 
In Study-05A, 1,055 patients on haemodialysis (N=968) or peritoneal dialysis (N=87) with serum 
phosphorus ≥1.94 mmol/L following a 2 – 4 week phosphate binder washout period, were randomised 
and treated with either sucroferric oxyhydroxide, at a starting dose of 1,000 mg iron/day (N=707), or 
active-control (sevelamer carbonate, N=348) for 24 weeks. At the end of week 24, 93 patients on 
haemodialysis whose serum phosphorus levels were controlled (<1.78 mmol/L) with sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide in the first part of the study, were re-randomised to continue treatment with either their 
week 24 maintenance dose (N=44 or a non-effective low dose control 250 mg iron/day, N=49) of 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide for a further 3 weeks. 
Following completion of Study-05A, 658 patients (597 on haemodialysis and 61 on peritoneal 
dialysis) were treated in the 28 week extension study (Study-05B) with either sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide (N=391) or sevelamer carbonate (N=267) according to their original randomization. 
Mean serum phosphorus levels were 2.5 mmol/L at baseline and 1.8 mmol/L at week 12 for 
sucroferric oxyhydroxide (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L). Corresponding levels for sevelamer carbonate at 
baseline were 2.4 mmol/L and 1.7 mmol/L at week 12 (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L), respectively. 
The serum phosphorus reduction was maintained over 55 weeks. Serum phosphorus levels and 
calcium-phosphorus product levels were reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate 
absorption. 
The response rates, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving serum phosphorus levels within the 
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommended range were 45.3% and 59.1% at 
week 12 and 51.9% and 55.2% at week 52, for sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer carbonate, 
respectively. 
The mean daily dose of Velphoro over 55 weeks of treatment was 1,650 mg iron and the mean daily 
dose of sevelamer carbonate was 6,960 mg.

Post-authorisation data 
A prospective, non-interventional, post-authorisation safety study (VERIFIE) has been conducted, 
evaluating the short- and long-term (up to 36 months) safety and effectiveness of Velphoro in adult 
patients on haemodialysis (N=1,198) or peritoneal dialysis (N=160), who were followed in routine 
clinical practice for 12 to 36 months (safety analysis set, N=1,365). During the study, 45% (N=618) of 
these patients were concomitantly treated with phosphate binder(s) other than Velphoro. 
In the safety analysis set, the most common ADRs were diarrhoea and discoloured faeces, reported by 
14% (N=194) and 9% (N=128) of patients, respectively. The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in the 
first week and decreased with duration of use. Diarrhoea was of mild to moderate intensity in most 
patients and resolved in the majority of patients within 2 weeks. Discoloured (black) faeces is expected 
for an oral iron-based compound, and may visually mask gastrointestinal bleeding. For 4 of the 40 
documented concomitant gastrointestinal bleeding events, Velphoro-related stool discolouration was 
reported as causing an insignificant delay in diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, without affecting 
patient health. In the remaining cases, no delay in diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding has been 
reported. 
The results from this study showed that the effectiveness of Velphoro in a real-life setting (including 
concomitant use of other phosphate binders in 45% of patients), was in line with that observed in the 
phase 3 clinical study. 
Paediatric population 
An open label clinical study investigated the efficacy and safety of Velphoro in paediatric patients 2 
years of age and older with CKD and hyperphosphatemia (CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min/l .73 m²) or with CKD on dialysis). Eighty-five subjects were randomised to 
Velphoro  (N=66) or active control calcium acetate arm (N=19) for a 10-week dose titration (Stage 1), 
followed by a 24-week safety extension (Stage 2). Most patients were ≥12 years of age (66%). Eighty 
percent of patients were CKD patients on dialysis (67% on haemodialysis and 13% on peritoneal 
dialysis) and 20% were CKD patients not on dialysis. 
The limited difference in reduction in mean serum phosphorus level from baseline to the end of Stage 
1 in the Velphoro group (N=65) was not statistically significant with -0.120 (0.081) mmol/L (95% CI: 
-0.282, 0.043) based on the mixed model calculations with actual data showing a mean of 2.08 
mmol/L at baseline and 1.91 mmol/L at the end of Stage 1 (reduction by 0.17 mmol/L). The effect was 
maintained during Stage 2, although some fluctuations in mean effect over time were noticed (0.099 
(0.198) mmol/L (95% CI: -0.306, 0.504)). 
The percentage of subjects with serum phosphorus levels within normal ranges increased from 37% at 
baseline to 61% at the end of Stage 1, and was 58% at the end of Stage 2, showing the sustainable 
phosphorus lowering effect of sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Among subjects whose serum phosphorus 
was above age-related normal ranges at baseline (N=40), serum phosphorus levels showed statistically 
significant decrease from baseline to the end of Stage 1, with the LS mean (SE) change -0.87 (0.30) 
mg/dL (95% CI: -1.47, -0.27; p=0.006). 
The safety profile of Velphoro in paediatric patients was generally comparable to that previously 
observed in adult patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Velphoro works by binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the serum concentration is 
not relevant for its efficacy. Due to the insolubility and degradation characteristics of Velphoro, no 
classical pharmacokinetic studies can be carried out, e.g., determination of the distribution volume, 
area under the curve, mean residence time, etc. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2 Phase 1 studies, it was concluded that the potential for iron overload is minimal and no dose 
dependent effects were observed in healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
The active moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is practically insoluble and therefore not absorbed. Its 
degradation product, mononuclear iron species, can however be released from the surface of pn-
FeOOH and be absorbed. 
The absolute absorption studies in humans were not performed. Non-clinical studies in several species 
(rats and dogs) showed that systemic absorption was very low (≤1% of the administered dose). 
The iron uptake from radiolabelled Velphoro active substance, 2,000 mg iron in 1 day was investigated 
in 16 CKD patients (8 pre-dialysis and 8 haemodialysis patients) and 8 healthy volunteers with low 
iron stores (serum ferritin <100 mcg/L). In healthy subjects, the median uptake of radiolabelled iron in 
the blood was estimated to be 0.43% (range 0.16 – 1.25%) on day 21, in pre-dialysis patients 0.06% 
(range 0.008 – 0.44%) and in haemodialysis patients 0.02% (range 0 – 0.04%). Blood levels of 
radiolabelled iron were very low and confined to the erythrocytes. 
Distribution 
The distribution studies in humans were not performed. Non-clinical studies in several species (rats 
and dogs) showed that pn-FeOOH is distributed from the plasma to the liver, spleen and bone marrow, 
and utilized by incorporation into red blood cells. 
In patients, absorbed iron is expected to be also distributed to the target organs, i.e. liver, spleen and 
bone marrow, and utilized by incorporation into red blood cells. 
Biotransformation 
The active moiety of Velphoro, pn-FeOOH, is not metabolised. However, the degradation product of 
Velphoro, mononuclear iron species, can be released from the surface of polynuclear iron(III)-
oxyhydroxide and be absorbed. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the systemic absorption of iron 
from Velphoro is low. 
In vitro data suggest that the sucrose and starch components of the active substance can be digested to 
glucose and fructose, and maltose and glucose, respectively. These compounds can be absorbed in the 
blood. 
Elimination 
In animal studies with rats and dogs administered 59Fe-Velphoro active substance orally, radiolabelled 
iron was recovered in the faeces but not the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects seen in the rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study (skeletal variations and incomplete 
ossificaton) are related to exaggerated pharmacology, and likely not relevant for patients. Other 
reproduction toxicity studies showed no adverse effects. 
Carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats. There was no clear evidence of a 
carcinogenic effect in mice. Mucosal hyperplasia, with diverticulum/cyst formation was observed in 
the colon and caecum of mice after 2 years treatment, but this was considered a species-specific effect 
with no diverticula/cysts seen in long term studies in rats or dogs. In rats, there was a slightly increased 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incidence of benign C cell adenoma in the thyroid of male rats given the highest dose of sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide. This is thought to be most likely an adaptive response to the pharmacological effect of 
the medicinal product, and not clinically relevant.

This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Velphoro is and what it is used for 
Velphoro is a medicine that contains the active substance sucroferric oxyhydroxide, which is made up 
from iron, sugar (sucrose) and starches. 
This medicine is used to control high blood phosphate levels (hyperphosphataemia) in: 
• 
adult patients who undergo haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (procedures to eliminate toxic 
substances from the blood) because of chronic kidney disease; 
children from 2 years of age and adolescents with chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5 (severe 
decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or on dialysis. 
• 
Too much phosphorus in the blood can lead to calcium being deposited in tissues (calcification). This 
can result in stiffening of the blood vessels, making it harder for the blood to be pumped around the 
body. It may also lead to calcium deposits in soft tissues and bone causing effects such as red eyes, 
itchy skin and bone pain. 
This medicine works by binding phosphorus from food in your digestive tract (stomach and intestines). 
This reduces the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed into the bloodstream and thus lowers 
phosphorus levels in your blood. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Velphoro 
Do not take Velphoro 
– 
– 
– 
if you are allergic to sucroferric oxyhydroxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
if you have a history of abnormal iron build-up in your organs (haemochromatosis); 
if you have any other disorder associated with too much iron. 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Velphoro: 
– 
if you have had peritonitis, an inflammation of the peritoneum (the thin tissue that lines the inner 
wall of the abdomen) within the last 3 months; 
if you have significant stomach and/or liver problems; 
if you have had major surgery on your stomach and/or intestines. 
– 
– 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
this medicine. 
This medicine can cause black stools. Any potential bleeding from your digestive tract (stomach and 
gut) may be hidden by these black stools. If you have black stools and also have symptoms like 
increasing tiredness and breathlessness contact your doctor immediately (see section 4). 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children below the age of 2 years has not yet been established. Therefore, 
this medicine is not recommended for use in children under 2 years. 
Other medicines and Velphoro 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If you are taking any other medicine that is known to be affected by iron (for example medicines 
containing the active substance alendronate (used to treat certain bone disorders) or doxycycline (an 
antibiotic)) or has the potential to be affected by iron (for example medicines containing the active 
substance levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid function disorder)), make sure that you take this 
medicine at least one hour before taking Velphoro or at least two hours after taking Velphoro. Ask 
your doctor if you are not sure. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is no information on the effects of this medicine if taken during pregnancy or breast-feeding. If 
you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will advise you whether Velphoro should be used during pregnancy, based on benefit and 
risk assessment for use during pregnancy. 
If you are breast-feeding, your doctor will discuss with you whether to continue breast-feeding or to 
continue therapy with Velphoro, taking into account the benefit of Velphoro therapy to you and the 
benefit of breast-feeding to your child. 
It is unlikely that this medicine would pass into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no significant effect on your ability to drive or to use tools or machines. 
Velphoro contains sucrose and starches (carbohydrates) 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
This medicine may be harmful to the teeth. 
This medicine contains starches. If you have diabetes you should take notice that one tablet of this 
medicine is equivalent to approximately 1.4 g of carbohydrates (equivalent to 0.116 bread units). 
43

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Velphoro is and what it is used for 
Velphoro is a medicine that contains the active substance sucroferric oxyhydroxide, which is made up 
from iron, sugar (sucrose) and starches. 
This medicine is used to control high blood phosphate levels (hyperphosphataemia) in:  
– 
adult patients who undergo haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (procedures to eliminate toxic 
substances from the blood) because of chronic kidney disease;  
children from 2 years of age and adolescents with chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5 (severe 
decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or on dialysis. 
– 
Too much phosphorus in the blood can lead to calcium being deposited in tissues (calcification). This 
can result in stiffening of the blood vessels, making it harder for the blood to be pumped around the 
body. It may also lead to calcium deposits in soft tissues and bone causing effects such as red eyes, 
itchy skin and bone pain. 
This medicine works by binding phosphorus from food in your digestive tract (stomach and intestines). 
This reduces the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed into the bloodstream and thus lowers 
phosphorus levels in your blood. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Velphoro 
Do not take Velphoro 
– 
if you are allergic to sucroferric oxyhydroxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
if you have a history of abnormal iron build-up in your organs (haemochromatosis); 
if you have any other disorder associated with too much iron.

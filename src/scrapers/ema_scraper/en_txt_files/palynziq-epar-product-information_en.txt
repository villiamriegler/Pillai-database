CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Palynziq is indicated for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 16 years and older 
who have inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater than 
600 micromol/l) despite prior management with available treatment options.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Palynziq should be directed by physicians experienced in the management of PKU. 
Posology 
Before initiating treatment, blood phenylalanine level must be obtained. Monitoring of blood 
phenylalanine level is recommended once a month. 
Dietary phenylalanine intake should remain consistent until a maintenance dose is established. 
Dosing regimens 
Induction 
The recommended starting dose of Palynziq is 2.5 mg administered once per week for 4 weeks. 
Titration 
The dose should be escalated gradually based on tolerability to the daily maintenance dose required to 
achieve blood phenylalanine level of 120 to 600 micromol/l according to Table 1.  
Maintenance 
The maintenance dose is individualised to achieve patient’s blood phenylalanine control (i.e., a 
phenylalanine level between 120 to 600 micromol/l) taking into account patient tolerability to 
Palynziq and dietary protein intake (see Table 1).

Maximum recommended dose 
1 If blood phenylalanine levels are below 30 micromol/l, dietary protein intake should be increased 
to appropriate levels, and then, if needed, the dose of Palynziq should be reduced (see section 4.4, 
Hypophenylalaninaemia). 
2 Additional time may be required prior to each dose escalation based on patient tolerability with 
Palynziq. 
3 The maintenance dose is individualised to achieve blood phenylalanine levels between 120 to 
600 micromol/l. 
4 If multiple injections are needed for a single dose, injections should be administered at the same 
time of day and injection sites should be at least 5 cm away from each other. Doses should not be 
divided over the course of the day (see Method of administration). 
Dose adjustments 
During titration and maintenance of Palynziq treatment, patients may develop blood phenylalanine 
levels below 30 micromol/l. To manage hypophenylalaninaemia, dietary protein intake should be 
increased to appropriate levels, and then, if needed, the dose of Palynziq should be reduced. In patients 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experiencing hypophenylalaninaemia despite appropriate levels of protein intake, dose reductions are 
expected to be most effective in managing hypophenylalaninaemia (see section 5.2, Exposure-effect). 
Patients should be monitored every 2 weeks until blood phenylalanine levels are within a clinically 
acceptable range (see section 4.4, Hypophenylalaninaemia).  
If hypophenylalaninaemia develops prior to reaching daily dosing, the dose may be reduced to the 
previous titration dose. If hypophenylalaninaemia develops once daily dosing is reached, the dose may 
be reduced by at least 10 mg decrements to achieve and maintain blood phenylalanine levels in the 
clinically acceptable range. In patients experiencing hypophenylalaninaemia on 10 mg/day, the dose 
may be reduced to 5 mg/day.  
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Palynziq in paediatric patients from birth to less than 16 years have not 
been established. No data are available.  
Currently available data on patients aged 16 up to 18 years are described in section 4.8 and 5.1. 
Posology is the same in these patients as in adults.  
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use. Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only.  
Due to the potential for an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction, premedication prior to each dose 
is required during induction and titration (time prior to reaching blood phenylalanine levels less than 
600 micromol/l while on a stable dose; see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to pre-medicate 
with an H1-receptor antagonist, H2-receptor antagonist, and antipyretic. During maintenance, 
premedication may be reconsidered for subsequent injections based on patient tolerability to Palynziq. 
Initial administration(s) should be performed under supervision of a healthcare professional and 
patients should be closely observed for at least 60 minutes following each of these initial injection(s) 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Prior to first dose of Palynziq, the patient should be trained on the signs and symptoms of an acute 
systemic hypersensitivity reaction and to seek immediate medical care if a reaction occurs, and how to 
properly administer adrenaline injection device (auto-injector or pre-filled syringe/pen). 
Patients should be instructed to carry an adrenaline injection device with them at all times during 
Palynziq treatment.  
For at least the first 6 months of treatment when the patient is self-injecting (i.e. when administration 
is not under healthcare professional supervision), an observer must be present during and for at least 
60 minutes after each administration. An observer is someone who:  
• 
• 
• 
would be present with the patient during and after Palynziq administration,  
is able to recognise the signs and symptoms of an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction,  
can call for emergency medical support and administer adrenaline, if warranted.  
After 6 months of Palynziq treatment, the need for an observer may be reconsidered. 
Prior to independent self-injection, a healthcare professional should: 
• 
train the patient and assess patient competency on proper self-administration of this medicinal 
product.  
train the observer to recognise signs and symptoms of an acute systemic hypersensitivity 
reaction and to seek immediate medical care if a reaction occurs, and how to properly 
administer adrenaline injection device (auto-injector or pre-filled syringe/pen). 
• 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Re-administration following mild to moderate acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions: The 
prescribing physician should consider the risks and benefits of re-administering the medicinal product 
following resolution of the first mild to moderate acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). Re-administration for the first dose must be done under supervision of a 
healthcare professional with the ability to manage acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions.  
The recommended injection sites on the body are: the front middle of the thighs and the lower part of 
the abdomen except for 5 cm directly around the navel. If a caregiver is giving the injection, the top of 
the buttocks and the back of the upper arms are also appropriate injection sites. 
Palynziq should not be injected into moles, scars, birthmarks, bruises, rashes, or areas where the skin 
is hard, tender, red, damaged, burned, inflamed, or tattooed. The injection site should be checked for 
redness, swelling, or tenderness. 
Patients or caregiver should be advised to rotate sites for subcutaneous injections. If more than one 
injection is needed for a single dose, each injection site should be at least 5 cm away from another 
injection site.  
Palynziq is a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow solution. The solution should not be 
used if discoloured or cloudy or if visible particles are present. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction or recurrence of a mild to moderate acute systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction to pegvaliase, any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or another 
PEGylated medicinal product (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions cover a group of terms that comprises acute systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions, other systemic hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and serum sickness which 
may have an acute or chronic presentation, and local hypersensitivity reactions such as injection site 
reactions or other skin reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported 
in patients treated with Palynziq and can occur at any time during treatment. Palynziq may also 
increase hypersensitivity to other PEGylated injectable medicinal products (see Effect of Palynziq on 
other PEGylated injectable medicinal products). The risk of a hypersensitivity reaction is 2.6-fold 
higher in induction/titration phase compared to the maintenance phase.  
Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction; in clinical 
trials, this has included dose adjustment, treatment interruption or discontinuation, additional 
antihistamines, antipyretics, corticosteroids, adrenaline, and/or oxygen (see sections 4.2, method of 
administration and 4.8). 
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions (Type III) 
The underlying mechanism for acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions observed in clinical trials was 
non-IgE mediated Type III (immune-complex mediated) hypersensitivity (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Manifestations of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions included a combination of the following 
acute signs and symptoms: syncope, hypotension, hypoxia, dyspnoea, wheezing, chest 
discomfort/chest tightness, tachycardia, angioedema (swelling of face, lips, eyes, and tongue), 
flushing, rash, urticaria, pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, nausea, and diarrhoea). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions were considered severe based on the presence of cyanosis or 
oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than or equal to 92%, hypotension (systolic blood pressure below 
90 mm Hg in adults) or syncope. Four out of 16 (1%, 4/285) patients experienced a total of 5 episodes 
of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions that were considered severe. The risk of an acute systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction occurring is 6-fold higher in induction/titration phase compared to 
maintenance phase. 
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions require treatment with adrenaline and immediate medical 
care. An adrenaline injection device (auto-injector or pre-filled syringe/pen) should be prescribed to 
patients receiving this medicinal product. Patients should be instructed to carry an adrenaline injection 
device with them at all times during Palynziq treatment. Patients and the observer should be instructed 
to recognise the signs and symptoms of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, in the proper 
emergency use of the adrenaline injection device, and the requirement to seek immediate medical care. 
The risks associated with adrenaline use should be reconsidered when prescribing Palynziq. Refer to 
the adrenaline product information for complete information. For recurrence of a mild to moderate 
acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction patients should seek immediate medical care and Palynziq 
should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Due to the potential for acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, premedication prior to each dose is 
required during induction and titration (see section 4.2, Method of administration). Patients should be 
instructed to pre-medicate with an H1-receptor antagonist, H2-receptor antagonist, and antipyretic. 
During maintenance, premedication may be considered for subsequent injections based on patient 
tolerability to Palynziq. For at least the first 6 months of treatment when the patient is self-injecting 
(i.e. when administration is not under healthcare professional supervision), an observer must be 
present during and for at least 60 minutes after each administration (see section 4.2, Method of 
administration).  
Other systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
For other severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, severe angioedema, severe 
serum sickness), patients should seek immediate medical care and Palynziq should be permanently 
discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Re-administering following an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction 
The prescribing physician should consider the risks and benefits of re-administering the medicinal 
product following resolution of the first mild to moderate acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction. 
Upon re-administration, the first dose must be administered with premedication under the supervision 
of a healthcare professional with the ability to manage acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions. The 
prescribing physician should continue or consider resuming use of premedication. 
Dose titration and time to achieve response 
Time to response (achieving blood phenylalanine levels ≤ 600 micromol/l) varies among patients. The 
time to reach a response ranged from 0.5 to 54 months. The majority of patients (67%) reached a 
response by 18 months of total treatment. An additional 8% of patients responded to Palynziq after 
18 months of treatment. If a patient does not reach a clinically relevant blood phenylalanine reduction 
after 18 months of treatment, continuation should be reconsidered. The physician may decide, with the 
patient, to continue Palynziq treatment in those patients who show other beneficial effects (e.g., ability 
to increase protein intake from intact food or improvement of neurocognitive symptoms). 
Effect of Palynziq on other PEGylated injectable medicinal products 
PEGylated proteins have the potential to elicit an immune response. Because antibodies bind to the 
PEG portion of pegvaliase, there may be potential for binding with other PEGylated therapeutics and 
increased hypersensitivity to other PEGylated injectables. In a single dose study of Palynziq in adult 
patients with PKU, two patients receiving concomitant injections of medroxyprogesterone acetate 
suspension containing PEG experienced hypersensitivity reactions. One of the two patients 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experienced a hypersensitivity reaction on day 15 after a single Palynziq dose within 15 minutes 
following medroxyprogesterone acetate, and subsequently experienced an acute systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction on day 89 within 30 minutes after the next dose of medroxyprogesterone 
acetate injectable suspension. The second patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction on day 40 
after a single Palynziq dose within 10 minutes following medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable 
suspension. In Palynziq clinical trials, the majority of patients developed anti-PEG IgM and IgG 
antibodies after treatment with Palynziq (see section 4.8). The impact of anti-PEG antibodies on the 
clinical effects of other PEG-containing medicinal products is unknown. 
Hypophenylalaninaemia  
In clinical trials, 46% of the patients developed hypophenylalaninaemia (blood phenylalanine levels 
below 30 micromol/l on two consecutive measurements). The risk of hypophenylalaninaemia 
occurring is 2.1-fold higher in the maintenance phase compared to the induction/titration phase (see 
section 4.8).  
Monitoring of blood phenylalanine level is recommended once a month. In case of 
hypophenylalaninaemia, dietary protein intake should be increased to appropriate levels, and then, if 
needed, the dose of Palynziq should be reduced (see section 4.2). In patients experiencing 
hypophenylalaninaemia despite appropriate levels of protein intake, dose reductions are expected to be 
most effective in managing hypophenylalaninaemia. Patients who develop hypophenylalaninaemia 
should be monitored every 2 weeks until blood phenylalanine level is within a clinically acceptable 
range. The long-term clinical consequences of chronic hypophenylalaninaemia are unknown.  
Based on animal studies, hypophenylalaninaemia in pregnant women with PKU treated with Palynziq 
may be associated with adverse foetal outcomes (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). Blood phenylalanine levels 
should be monitored more frequently prior to and during pregnancy.  
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of Palynziq in pregnant women. Animal studies 
have shown maternal reproductive toxicity that was associated with decreased blood phenylalanine 
concentrations below normal levels (see section 5.3). 
Uncontrolled blood phenylalanine levels (hyperphenylalaninaemia) before and during pregnancy are 
associated with increased risk for miscarriage, major birth defects (including microcephaly and major 
cardiac malformations), intrauterine foetal growth retardation and future intellectual disability with 
low IQ. In case of hypophenylalaninaemia during pregnancy, there is a risk of intrauterine foetal 
growth retardation. Additional risk to the unborn child due to hypophenylalaninaemia is not 
established. 
Maternal blood phenylalanine levels must be strictly controlled between 120 and 360 micromol/l both 
before and during pregnancy. Palynziq is not recommended during pregnancy, unless the clinical 
condition of the woman requires treatment with pegvaliase and alternative strategies to control 
phenylalanine levels have been exhausted.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pegvaliase is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals 
have shown excretion of pegvaliase in milk. In the pups of these animals, systemic exposure of 
pegvaliase was not detected. A risk to infants cannot be excluded. Due to lack of human data, Palynziq 
should only be administered to breast-feeding women if the potential benefit is considered to outweigh 
the potential risk to the infant. 
Fertility 
No human data are available. Reduced implantations were observed in normal female rats after 
administration of Palynziq (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Palynziq has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Hypersensitivity reactions 
that include symptoms such as dizziness or syncope may affect the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials, the majority of patients experienced injection site reactions (93%), arthralgia (86%), 
and hypersensitivity reactions (75%). The most clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions include 
acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction (6%), angioedema (7%), and serum sickness (2%) 
(see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  
In clinical trials, adverse reaction rates were highest in induction and titration phases (time prior to 
reaching blood phenylalanine levels less than 600 micromol/l while on a stable dose) coinciding with 
the period when titres of IgM and anti-PEG antibodies were highest. Rates decreased over time as the 
immune response matured (see Description of selected adverse reactions section).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 2 provides adverse reactions from clinical trials in patients treated with Palynziq. 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 
to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Arthralgia and other joint related signs and symptoms 
In clinical trials, 86% of patients experienced episodes consistent with arthralgia (including back pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, and neck pain). Arthralgia occurred as early as the first dose 
and can occur at any time during treatment. The risk of arthralgia occurring is 3.1-fold higher in 
induction/titration phase compared to maintenance phase.  
Severe arthralgia (severe pain limiting self-care activities of daily living) was experienced in 5% of 
patients. Arthralgia episodes were managed with concomitant medicinal products (e.g., nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and/or antipyretic), dose reduction, treatment interruption, 
or treatment withdrawal, and 97% of arthralgia episodes resolved by the time of study completion. 
Persistent arthralgia (lasting at least 6 months) occurred in 7% of patients. Dose was not changed for 
96% of episodes and all persistent arthralgia episodes resolved without sequelae. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions were reported in 93% of patients. The most common injection site reactions 
(occurring in at least 10% of patients) were reaction, erythema, bruising, pruritus, pain, swelling, rash, 
induration, and urticaria. The risk of injection site reactions occurring is 5.2-fold higher in 
induction/titration phase compared to maintenance phase. 
Injection site reactions occurred as early as the first dose and can occur at any time during treatment. 
The mean duration of injection site reaction was 10 days, and 99% of injection site reactions resolved 
by the time of study completion.  
Three injection site reactions consistent with granulomatous skin lesions were reported (each reaction 
occurring in one patient): granulomatous dermatitis (occurred 15 months after Palynziq treatment and 
lasted 16 days), xanthogranuloma (occurred 12 months after Palynziq treatment and lasted 21 months), 
and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (occurred 9 months after Palynziq treatment and lasted 
9 months). Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum was treated with steroid injections and complicated by 
Pseudomonas infection. All of these injection site reactions resolved. One patient reported soft tissue 
infection associated with mesenteric panniculitis, which resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
Cutaneous reactions (not limited to the injection site) lasting ≥ 14 days 
In clinical trials, 47% of patients treated with Palynziq experienced cutaneous reactions (not limited to 
the injection site) lasting at least 14 days. The risk of cutaneous reactions lasting at least 14 days 
occurring is 1.5-fold higher in induction/titration phase compared to maintenance phase.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common cutaneous reactions (at least 5% of patients) reported were pruritus, rash, erythema, 
and urticaria. Other reactions reported included skin exfoliation, generalised rash, erythematous rash, 
maculo-papular rash, and pruritic rash. The mean (SD) duration of these reactions was 63 (76) days, 
and 86% of these reactions resolved by the time of study completion. 
Immunogenicity 
All patients treated with Palynziq developed a sustained total anti-pegvaliase antibody (TAb) response 
with nearly all patients becoming positive by Week 4. Mean TAb titres were sustained through 
long-term treatment (greater than 3 years after treatment initiation). Anti-phenylalanine ammonia lyase 
(PAL) IgM was detected in nearly all treated patients by 2 months after treatment initiation, with 
incidence and mean titres gradually declining over time. Anti-PAL IgG was detected in nearly all 
patients by 4 months and mean titres were relatively stable through long-term treatment. Pegvaliase 
induced anti-PEG IgM and IgG responses were detected in nearly all patients, with mean titres 
peaking at 1 to 3 months after treatment initiation and returning to baseline levels in most patients by 6 
to 9 months after treatment initiation. Neutralising antibodies (NAb) capable of inhibiting PAL 
enzyme activity were detected in a majority of patients by 1 year after treatment initiation and mean 
titres were relatively stable through long-term treatment.  
All 16 patients who experienced acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions tested negative for 
pegvaliase-specific IgE at or near the time of the acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions episode. 
These reactions were consistent with a Type III immune-complex mediated hypersensitivity 
mechanism and were most frequent in the early phases of treatment (during the induction and titration 
periods) when the early immune response was dominated by PEG IgM, PEG IgG and PAL IgM 
responses and C3/C4 levels were at their lowest. Hypersensitivity reactions decreased over time in 
maintenance as the incidence of these antibodies decreased, and C3/C4 levels returned towards 
baseline. Presence of antibody titres was not predictive of hypersensitivity reactions.  
In clinical trials, a direct correlation between pegvaliase plasma exposure and blood phenylalanine 
reduction was observed. Pegvaliase plasma exposure was primarily driven by immune response to 
pegvaliase. Patients with lower antibody titres for all antibody analytes including NAb had higher 
pegvaliase concentrations due to less immune-mediated pegvaliase clearance. As a consequence, these 
patients were more likely to develop hypophenylalaninaemia. Patients with higher antibody titres 
required higher doses to overcome clearance and achieve blood phenylalanine reduction. However, 
due to the substantial variability in antibody titres between patients, no specific antibody titre was 
predictive of pegvaliase dose required to reach substantial blood phenylalanine reduction, or the 
development of hypophenylalaninaemia. During early treatment (less than 6 months after Palynziq 
administration) when immune-mediated clearance was high and doses were low, patients with higher 
antibody titres achieved less blood phenylalanine reduction. Following maturation of the early 
immune response (more than 6 months after Palynziq administration) and dose adjustment for 
managing blood phenylalanine control in long-term treatment, mean blood phenylalanine levels 
continued to decrease in patients who continued treatment (see section 5.1). Antibody titres were 
stable with long-term treatment and dose increases were not associated with increased antibody titres. 
Thus, mean dose levels also stabilized with long-term treatment with sustained therapeutic effect. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available in paediatric patients less than 16 years of age.  
Twelve patients (11 patients from Study 301) aged 16 up to 18 years received Palynziq treatment. 
Adverse reactions were similar in type and frequency to that of adult patients.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical trials, doses of pegvaliase were explored up to 150 mg/day and no specific signs or 
symptoms were identified following these higher doses. No differences in the safety profile were 
observed. For management of adverse reactions, see sections 4.4 and 4.8.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Enzymes, ATC code: 
A16AB19 
Pegvaliase is rAvPAL conjugated with linear 20 kDa NHS-PEG at a degree of substitution of 28 to 
44 moles of polymer/mole of protein. The average molecular mass is approximately 1,000 kDa of 
which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 248 kDa. 
Mechanism of action 
Pegvaliase is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme that converts 
phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid that are primarily eliminated by liver metabolism. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The effects of Palynziq in the treatment of PKU have been demonstrated in patients with 
phenylketonuria in Study 301, an open-label study to initiate Palynziq treatment, and Study 302, a 
follow-on study for efficacy assessment. 
Study 301: Treatment initiation (Induction and Titration)  
Study 301 an open-label randomised (1:1), multi-centre study of patients with PKU to assess the safety 
and tolerability of self-administered Palynziq in an induction/titration/maintenance dose regimen. The 
261 enrolled patients were aged 16 to 55 years (mean: 29 years) and had a baseline mean blood 
phenylalanine of 1233 micromol/l. At treatment initiation, 253 (97%) patients had inadequate blood 
phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels above 600 micromol/l) and 8 patients had blood 
phenylalanine levels less than or equal to 600 micromol/l. Patients previously treated with sapropterin 
were required to discontinue treatment at least 14 days prior to first dose of Palynziq. At baseline, 
149 (57%) patients were receiving part of their total protein intake from medical food and 41 out of 
261 (16%) patients were on a phenylalanine-restricted diet (defined as receiving greater than 75% of 
total protein intake from medical food). Patients initiated Palynziq treatment with an induction 
regimen (2.5 mg once week for 4 weeks) and were titrated in a stepwise manner (increased dose and 
frequency) to reach their randomised target dose of 20 mg once daily or 40 mg once daily. The 
duration of titration varied among patients and was based on patient tolerability (up to 30 weeks). For 
this study, the maintenance period was defined as at least 3 weeks dosing at randomised 20 mg or 
40 mg once daily.  
Of the 261 enrolled patients, 195 (75%) patients reached their randomised maintenance dose 
(103 patients in the 20 mg once daily arm, 92 patients in the 40 mg once daily arm). Patients in the 
20 mg once daily randomised arm reached their maintenance dose at a median time of 10 weeks 
(range: 9 to 29 weeks) and patients in the 40 mg once daily arm reached their maintenance dose at a 
median time of 11 weeks (range: 10 to 33 weeks). Of the 261 patients who enrolled in Study 301, 
152 patients continued to the eligibility period of Study 302, and 51 patients continued directly from 
Study 301 into the long-term extension period of Study 302.

Study 302: Efficacy assessment  
Study 302 was a follow-on study (from Study 301) and included: an open label eligibility period; a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised discontinuation trial period (RDT), and a long-term 
open-label extension period.  
Eligibility period  
A total of 164 previously-treated Palynziq patients (152 patients from Study 301, and 12 patients from 
other Palynziq trials) continued treatment for up to 13 weeks.  
Of the 164 patients that entered the eligibility period of Study 302, 86 patients met the eligibility 
criterion (achieved at least 20% mean blood phenylalanine reduction from pre-treatment baseline at 
their randomised dose within 13 weeks) and continued to the RDT, 12 patients discontinued treatment, 
and 57 patients did not enter the RDT and continued Palynziq treatment in the long-term extension 
period of Study 302, where they were allowed to increase dose. 
Randomised discontinuation trial (RDT) period 
In the double-blind, placebo-controlled RDT, patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either continue 
their randomised dosing (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day) or receive matching placebo for 8 weeks. 
The primary endpoint was change from RDT baseline to RDT Week 8 in blood phenylalanine levels. 
Palynziq-treated patients were able to maintain their blood phenylalanine reductions compared to the 
placebo patients whose blood phenylalanine levels returned to their pre-treatment baseline levels after 
8 weeks (p < 0.0001, see Table 3).

3 Nine patients were excluded from the Week 8 analysis from the Palynziq treatment arms (20 mg/day 
or 40 mg/day): 4 patients did not complete the RDT due to adverse events (1 patient discontinued 
treatment and 3 patients transitioned to the long-term extension period) and the remaining 5 patients 
who did not complete phenylalanine assessment within the window for Week 8 (Day 43 to 56).

1 patient did not complete the RDT due to adverse event transitioned to the long-term extension 
period and the remaining 4 patients who did not complete phenylalanine assessment within the 
window for Week 8 (Day 43 to 56). 
Symptoms of inattention and mood were also evaluated during this period. No differences were 
observed in inattention and mood between patients randomised to placebo versus those randomised to 
Palynziq during this 8-week duration.  
Long-term extension period 
Patients continued Palynziq treatment in the long-term open-label extension period and dose was 
adjusted (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/day) by the physician to achieve further blood phenylalanine 
reductions and maintain previously achieved phenylalanine levels.  
Overall treatment experience from Study 301 and Study 302 
At the time of completion of the studies, 188 out of the 261 patients received treatment for at least 
1 year, 4 patients completed treatment, and 69 discontinued treatment in the first year. Of these 
188 patients, 165 patients received treatment for at least 2 years, 22 patients discontinued in the second 
year, and 9 patients discontinued after 2 years of treatment. Of the 100 patients who discontinued 
treatment, 40 patients discontinued due to an adverse event, 29 patients discontinued due to patient 
decision, 10 patients discontinued due to physician decision, and 21 patients discontinued to other 
reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up, pregnancy, or protocol deviation). 
Efficacy results over time are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1.  
Phenylalanine levels over time 
Mean blood phenylalanine levels reduced from 1233 micromol/l at baseline to 565 micromol/l at 
Month 12 (n=164) and 333 micromol/l at Month 24 (n=89), and these reductions in mean blood 
phenylalanine levels were maintained through Month 36 (371 micromol/l; n=84) (see Table 4 and 
Figure 1). Median change from baseline was -634 micromol/l at Month 12, -968 micromol/l at 
Month 24, and -895 micromol/l at Month 36. 
ADHD inattention and PKU-POMS confusion over time 
Symptoms of inattention were assessed using the inattention subscale of the investigator-rated 
Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS IV). The ADHD-RS IV 
inattention subscale ranges from 0 to 27, higher scores indicate a greater degree of impairment, and a 
score below 9 indicates that the patient is asymptomatic (i.e. has a score that is in the normative 
range). Results for ADHD inattention subscale over time are shown in Table 4. Mean reduction 
(suggesting improvement) from baseline ADHD-RS inattention was above the minimally clinically 
important difference (MCID) for adults with ADHD (defined as a reduction of at least 5.2) at 
Month 18 (n=168; a reduction of 5.3), Month 24 (n=159; a reduction of 5.9) and Month 36 (n=142; a 
reduction of 6.6). In patients with baseline ADHD inattention scores > 9 (suggesting symptoms of 
inattention at baseline), mean reduction in ADHD inattention score from baseline (suggesting 
improvement) was above the MCID estimated for adults with ADHD at Month 12 (n=80; a reduction 
of 7.8), Month 18 (n=78; a reduction of 8.9), Month 24 (n=76; a reduction of 9.6) and Month 36 
(n=66; a reduction of 10.7).  
Symptoms of mood (confusion, fatigue, depression, tension-anxiety, vigour, and anger domains) were 
evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) tool that has been modified to be specific to PKU 
(PKU-POMS). The PKU-POMS confusion subscale (ranging from 0 to 12 points with higher scores 
indicating greater degree of impairment) was considered most sensitive to changes in blood 
phenylalanine levels. Results for PKU-POMS confusion subscale over time are shown in Table 4. 
Mean change from baseline PKU-POMS confusion subscale (suggesting improvement) was above 
MCID (defined as a reduction of at least 1) at Month 12 (n=130; a reduction of 1.6), Month 18 
(n=123; a reduction of 2), Month 24 (n=116; a reduction of 2.2) and Month 36 (n=103; a reduction of 
2.2).

Changes in protein intake from intact food over time 
Median protein intake from intact food increased at Month 12 (4 g increase from baseline), Month 24 
(14 g increase from baseline) and Month 36 (20 g increase from baseline).

Impact blood phenylalanine reduction on ADHD inattention and PKU-POMS confusion 
An analysis of ADHD inattention and PKU-POMS confusion subscales by change in blood 
phenylalanine from baseline quartiles showed that patients with the largest phenylalanine reductions 
experienced the greatest improvements in ADHD inattention and PKU-POMS confusion subscales.  
Paediatric population 
No data are available in paediatric patients less than 16 years of age.  
Of the 261 patients in Study 301, 11 patients were aged between 16 and 18 years at enrolment. All 
11 patients had inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels above 
600 micromol/l) at baseline. These patients received the same induction/titration/maintenance regimen 
as patients aged 18 years and older in this study. Mean (SD) change from baseline was 
20 (323) micromol/l at Month 12 (n=9), -460 (685) micromol/l at Month 24 (n=5), 
and -783 (406) micromol/l at Month 36 (n=5). Of the 11 patients initially enrolled in Study 301, 
3 patients reached blood phenylalanine levels ≤ 600 micromol/l by 12 months, 7 patients reached this 
threshold by 24 months, and 8 patients reached this threshold by 36 months. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Palynziq in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of 
hyperphenylalaninaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pegvaliase is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL), derived from the 
cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis expressed in Escherichia coli. The purpose of the PEGylation of 
rAvPAL is to reduce immune recognition of the rAvPAL bacterial protein and increase the half-life. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of pegvaliase exhibit high inter-patient and intra-patient variability due to the 
heterogeneity of the immune response in adult patients with PKU. Immune response affects clearance 
and time to reach steady state. The immune response stabilises over 6 to 9 months of total treatment.  
Absorption 
Following a single subcutaneous dose (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg), pegvaliase is absorbed slowly with a 
median tmax of 3.5 to 4 days (individual range of 2.5 to 7 days). The bioavailability is not affected by 
the different injection sites on the body (see section 4.2). The absolute bioavailability in humans is 
unknown. 
Distribution 
Mean (SD) for apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) at steady state following 20 mg and 40 mg 
doses was 26.4 L (64.8 L) and 22.2 L (19.7 L) respectively. 
Biotransformation 
Following cellular uptake, the metabolism of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is expected to occur 
via catabolic pathways and be degraded into small peptides and amino acids; the PEG molecule is 
metabolically stable and expected to be separated from PAL protein and primarily eliminated by renal 
filtration. 
Elimination 
Pegvaliase is primarily cleared by immune-mediated mechanisms following repeat dosing. In clinical 
studies, anti-PAL, anti-PEG and anti-pegvaliase have been identified as IgG and IgM mainly. 
Relatively low titres of IgE has also been observed. In maintenance phase of the treatment, steady state 
is expected 4 to 24 weeks after maintenance dose started. A mean (SD) half-life at 20 mg and 40 mg 
were 47.3 hours (41.6 hours) and 60.2 hours (44.6 hours), respectively. Individual values for half-life 
range from 14 to 132 hours. The PEG molecule is expected to be primarily eliminated by renal 
filtration.  
Linearity/nonlinearity 
During dose escalation from 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day and 40 mg/day to 60 mg/day, a greater dose 
proportional increase in exposure was observed.  
Specific populations 
Analysis of pegvaliase concentration data from clinical trials indicated that body weight, gender and 
age did not have a notable effect on pegvaliase pharmacokinetics. No clinical studies have been 
conducted to evaluate the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pegvaliase. 
Exposure-effect  
A PK/PD analysis using the Phase III data demonstrated an inverse pegvaliase exposure-phenylalanine 
response relationship, which could be influenced by dietary phenylalanine intake. At lower plasma 
pegvaliase Ctrough concentrations < 10,000 ng/ml, patients with higher dietary phenylalanine intake 
tend to have higher blood phenylalanine levels compared to patients with the same Ctrough 
concentration and lower dietary phenylalanine intake, suggesting saturation of the enzyme 
(i.e. rAvPAL). At high pegvaliase Ctrough concentrations ≥ 10,000 ng/ml, the majority of the blood 
phenylalanine levels (97%) are ≤ 30 micromol/l, even when dietary phenylalanine intake is high. 
Therefore, a reduction in pegvaliase dose should be considered in patients experiencing 
hypophenylalaninaemia despite appropriate levels of protein intake (see section 4.2). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Dose-dependent reductions in body weight gain attributed to decreased plasma phenylalanine levels to 
below normal levels in normal animals (monkeys, rats and rabbits) was observed in single and repeat 
dose toxicology studies as well as developmental and reproductive toxicity studies with pegvaliase. 
Decreased plasma phenylalanine and reduced body weight gain was reversible after cessation of 
treatment.  
In cynomolgus monkeys, the incidence and severity of arterial inflammation was dose dependent and 
observed in a wide range of organs and tissues at clinically relevant exposures in the 4- and 39-week 
repeat-dose toxicology studies. The arterial inflammation observed in these studies involved small 
arteries and arterioles in a wide range of organs and tissues and in subcutaneous injection sites. 
Arteritis was attributed to the immune-mediated response associated with chronic administration of 
foreign protein to the animals. The vascular inflammation observed in these studies was reversible 
upon cessation of treatment. 
In rats, dose dependent vacuolation attributed to pegvaliase treatment was observed at clinically 
relevant exposures in the 4- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats in multiple organs and 
tissues, but not in cynomolgus monkeys. No vacuolation was observed in the brain. Vacuoles in all 
tissues, with the exception of the kidney, resolved or were diminished by the end of the recovery 
period, suggesting partial reversibility. The vacuolation observed in these studies was not associated 
with any organ related toxicities as determined by clinical chemistry/urinalysis and histopathological 
analysis. The clinical significance of these findings and functional consequences are unknown. 
Adverse reproductive and developmental effects of pegvaliase in rats and rabbits were dose dependent 
and included reduced implantation rate, smaller litter size, lower foetal weights, and increased foetal 
alterations. Additional findings in rabbits included increased abortions, foetal malformations and 
embryo/foetal lethality. These findings occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body 
weights, decreased ovarian weights, and decreased food consumption) and were associated with 
markedly decreased maternal blood phenylalanine below normal levels in non-PKU animals. The 
contribution of maternal phenylalanine depletion to the incidence of embryo-foetal developmental 
effects was not evaluated. 
In the peri/postnatal study, pegvaliase decreased pup weight, litter size, and survival of offspring 
during lactation, and delayed sexual maturation of offspring when administered daily in rats at 
20 mg/kg subcutaneously. The effects in offspring were associated with maternal toxicity.  
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential or studies to evaluate mutagenic 
potential have not been performed with pegvaliase. Based on its mechanism of action, pegvaliase is 
not expected to be tumorigenic.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Palynziq is and what it is used for 
Palynziq contains the active substance pegvaliase, an enzyme that can break down a substance called 
phenylalanine in the body. Palynziq is a treatment for patients aged 16 years and older with 
phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that causes phenylalanine from proteins in food to 
build up in the body. People who have PKU have high levels of phenylalanine and this can lead to 
serious health problems. Palynziq reduces the levels of phenylalanine in the blood of patients who 
have PKU whose blood phenylalanine levels cannot be kept below 600 micromol/l by other means 
such as by diet.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Palynziq 
Do not use Palynziq 
- 
if you have a severe allergy to pegvaliase or any other ingredients of this medicine, or another 
medicine that contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Palynziq. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic reactions  
You may have allergic reactions when being treated with Palynziq. Your doctor will tell you how to 
manage your allergic reactions based on the severity of the reaction, and will prescribe you additional 
medicines to manage the reaction. 
Before using Palynziq, tell your doctor if you cannot use or do not want to use an adrenaline injection 
device to treat a severe allergic reaction to Palynziq. 
Palynziq can cause severe allergic reactions that may be life-threatening and these can happen any 
time after a Palynziq injection.  
• 
Stop injecting Palynziq if any of the following symptoms occur.  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Swelling of the face, eyes, lips, mouth, throat, tongue, hands and/or feet 
Trouble breathing or wheezing 
Throat tightness or choking feeling 
Trouble swallowing or speaking 
Feeling dizzy or fainting 
Losing control of urine or stools 
Rapid heartbeat 
Hives (like an itchy, bumpy skin rash) that spreads quickly  
Flushing 
Severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting, or diarrhoea 
• 
Use adrenaline injection device as instructed by your doctor and seek urgent medical 
assistance.  
Your doctor will prescribe an adrenaline injection device to use for a severe allergic reaction. Your 
doctor will train you and someone helping you on when and how to use adrenaline. Keep the 
adrenaline injection device with you at all times.  
For at least the first 6 months of treatment, someone must be with you when you are self-injecting 
Palynziq. This person must stay with you for at least 1 hour after your injection to watch you for signs 
and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and, if needed, give you an injection of adrenaline and call 
for emergency medical help. 
If you have a severe allergic reaction, do not continue to use Palynziq until you have talked with the 
doctor who prescribes you Palynziq. Tell your doctor that you had a severe allergic reaction. Your 
doctor will tell you if you can continue Palynziq treatment. 
Time needed to lower your blood phenylalanine levels 
Your doctor will start you on Palynziq at a low dose and will increase your dose slowly. It will take 
time to find the dose that works best to lower your blood phenylalanine levels. Most people respond 
within 18 months, but it can sometimes take up to 30 months. 
Injection of other medicines that contain PEG while using Palynziq  
Palynziq includes an ingredient called polyethylene glycol (PEG). If you inject Palynziq with another 
injectable medicine that contains PEG, such as PEGylated medroxyprogesterone acetate, you may 
have an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are injecting, have recently injected or 
might inject any other medicines. 
Blood phenylalanine levels that are too low 
You may have blood phenylalanine levels that are too low when using Palynziq. Your doctor will 
check your blood phenylalanine levels monthly. If your blood phenylalanine levels are too low, your 
doctor may ask you to change your diet and/or will lower your dose of Palynziq. Your doctor will 
check your blood phenylalanine levels every 2 weeks until your blood phenylalanine levels return to 
normal. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
It is not known if Palynziq is safe and effective in children and adolescents less than 16 years of age 
with PKU and therefore should not be used in people aged less than 16 years. 
Other medicines and Palynziq 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Palynziq is not recommended during pregnancy unless your condition requires treatment with 
Palynziq and other ways of controlling your blood phenylalanine levels do not work. If your 
phenylalanine levels are too high or too low during pregnancy, this may harm you or your baby. You 
and your doctor will decide the best way for you to manage your blood phenylalanine levels. It is very 
important to keep your phenylalanine levels under control before and during pregnancy. 
It is not known if Palynziq passes into breast milk or if it will affect your baby. Talk to your healthcare 
provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use Palynziq. 
It is not known if Palynziq has an effect on fertility. Animal studies suggest that women may have 
difficulty becoming pregnant if their phenylalanine levels are abnormally low. 
Driving and using machines 
Palynziq can affect your ability to drive and use machines if you have a severe allergic reaction. 
Palynziq contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Palynziq 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Palynziq is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
Dose 
• 
• 
• 
You will start Palynziq at the lowest dose. You will use the 2.5 mg syringe once a week for at 
least the first 4 weeks. The 2.5 mg syringe has a white plunger.  
Your doctor will then slowly increase your dose and/or how often you inject Palynziq. Your 
doctor will tell you how long to stay at each dose. Slowly increasing your dose over time allows 
your body to adjust to this medicine.  
The goal is to reach a daily dose that lowers your blood phenylalanine levels to within the target 
range of 120 to 600 micromol/l and does not cause too many side effects. Patients usually need 
a daily dose of 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg to reach their target blood phenylalanine level.

all injections should be done at the same time of day and 
injection sites should be at least 5 centimetres away from each 
other. Do not divide your daily dose throughout the day. 
• 
• 
Your doctor will continue to check your blood phenylalanine levels during treatment and may 
adjust your dose of Palynziq or ask you to change your diet. 
Your doctor will need to check your blood phenylalanine monthly to see if this medicine is 
working for you.  
Starting Palynziq 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Your healthcare provider will give you the Palynziq injection until you (or a caregiver) can do it 
yourself.  
Your doctor will prescribe medicines for you to take before your Palynziq injection, such as 
paracetamol, fexofenadine, and/or ranitidine. These medicines help to reduce the symptoms of 
an allergic reaction. 
A healthcare provider will monitor you for at least 1 hour after you get Palynziq for signs and 
symptoms of an allergic reaction. 
Your doctor will also prescribe adrenaline injection device to use for any severe allergic 
reactions. Your healthcare provider will also tell you which signs and symptoms to look out for 
and what to do if you have a severe allergic reaction. 
Your doctor will show you how and when to use the adrenaline injection device. Keep it with 
you at all times.  
Continuing Palynziq 
• 
• 
• 
• 
how to prepare and inject Palynziq and 
how to throw away Palynziq syringes properly after you use them 
This medicine comes in pre-filled syringes with 3 different strengths (2.5 mg-white plunger, 
10 mg-green plunger, or 20 mg-blue plunger). You may need more than one pre-filled syringe 
for your prescribed dose. Your healthcare provider will tell you which syringe, or a combination 
of syringes, to use and will show you (or a caregiver) how to inject Palynziq.  
The “Instructions for Use” (section 7 of this leaflet) shows you: 
o 
o 
Your doctor will tell you how long to continue taking medicines such as paracetamol, 
fexofenadine, and/or ranitidine before you take Palynziq. 
For at least the first 6 months of Palynziq treatment, you must have someone with you when 
you self-inject Palynziq, and for at least 1 hour after your injection to watch for signs and 
symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and, if needed, give you an injection of adrenaline and 
call for emergency medical help.  
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o 
Your doctor will train them on the signs and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and 
how to give an injection of adrenaline. 
Your doctor will tell you if you need an observer for longer than 6 months.  
o 
Do not change your protein intake unless your doctor tells you to. 
• 
If you use more Palynziq than you should 
If you use more Palynziq than you should, tell your doctor. See section 4 for details on what to do 
based on your symptoms.  
If you forget to use Palynziq 
If you miss a dose, take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of Palynziq to make 
up for a missed dose. 
If you stop taking Palynziq 
If you stop taking Palynziq treatment, your blood phenylalanine levels are likely to increase. Talk to 
your doctor before stopping Palynziq treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

PREPARING FOR INJECTION 
Step 1: Collect supplies: 
Gather your supplies for the injection and place them on a clean flat surface. Take out the required 
number of cartons needed for your dose from the refrigerator. 
Supplies you will need for your Palynziq Injection: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Palynziq pre-filled syringe(s) in sealed tray(s). Each tray contains 1 syringe. 
gauze pad or cotton ball 
1 alcohol pad 
1 bandage 
1 sharps disposal or puncture resistant container 
Step 2: Remove Palynziq tray(s) from carton and check expiry date: 
- 
Take out the cartons needed for your dose from the refrigerator. Check the expiry date on the 
carton. If the expiry date has passed, do not use the pre-filled syringe in that carton. 
Open each carton and take out the sealed tray you need for your dose. 
Place each sealed tray on a clean, flat surface out of reach of children and pets. 
Put the carton with any remaining trays back in the refrigerator. If a refrigerator is not available, 
see section 5 “How to store Palynziq” in this leaflet. 
- 
- 
- 
Step 3: Allow Palynziq tray(s) to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before opening: 
Let the sealed tray(s) sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Injecting cold Palynziq can be 
uncomfortable. 
- 
Do not warm up the pre-filled syringe in any other way. Do not use a microwave and do not 
place in hot water. 
Figure C 
Figure D 
Step 4: Remove syringe from tray: 
Peel the cover from the tray. Hold the middle of the 
pre-filled syringe body and take out the pre-filled 
syringe from the tray (see Figure C). 
• 
• 
• 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it 
looks damaged or used. Use a new 
pre-filled syringe for your injection. 
Do not remove the needle cap from 
your pre-filled syringe. 
Do not shake or roll the syringe in your 
hands. 
Step 5: Check syringe strength and check for particles: 
Check the syringe label to make sure you have the 
correct strength for your prescribed dose. Look at 
the liquid through the viewing window 
(see Figure D). The liquid should look clear and 
colourless to pale yellow. It is normal to see an air 
bubble. 
• 
• 
Do not flick or try to push the bubble 
out. 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the 
liquid is cloudy, discoloured, or has 
lumps or particles in it. Use a new 
pre-filled syringe for your injection.

INJECTING PALYNZIQ  
Step 6: Choose your injection site. 
The recommended injection sites are: 
• 
• 
Front middle of the thighs. 
Lower part of the abdomen except for 
the 5 centimetre area around the belly 
button (navel). 
If a caregiver is giving the injection, the top of the 
buttocks and the back of the upper arms may also be 
used (see Figure E). 
Note: 
• 
• 
• 
Do not inject into moles, scars, 
birthmarks, bruises, rashes, or areas 
where the skin is hard, tender, red, 
damaged, burned, inflamed, or tattooed.  
If you need more than 1 injection for 
your daily dose, the injection sites 
should be at least 5 centimetres away 
from each other (see Figures E and F). 
Each day, change (rotate) your injection 
sites. Choose an injection site that is at 
least 5 centimetres away from the 
injection site(s) you used the day before. 
It can be on the same part of the body or 
a different part of the body 
(see Figures E and F). 
Step 7: Wash your hands well with soap and water 
(see Figure G). 
Figure G 
Step 8: Clean the chosen site with an alcohol pad. 
Let the skin air dry for at least 10 seconds before 
injecting (see Figure H). 
• 
• 
• 
Do not touch the cleaned injection site. 
Do not remove the needle cap until you 
are ready to inject Palynziq. 
Before injecting, check to make sure the 
needle is not damaged or bent.

Inject Palynziq  
Step 9: Hold the body of the pre-filled syringe with one 
hand with the needle facing away from you (see Figure I). 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it has been 
dropped. Use a new pre-filled syringe for your 
injection. 
• 
Figure I 
Step 10: Pull the needle cap straight off the needle 
(see Figure J). 
Figure J 
• 
• 
Do not twist the needle cap during removal.  
Do not hold the pre-filled syringe by the 
plunger or plunger head while taking the 
needle cap off. 
You may see a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle. This 
is normal. Do not wipe it away. Throw the needle cap away 
in a sharps disposal or puncture-resistant container. 
Step 11: Hold the body of the pre-filled syringe in 1 hand 
between your thumb and index finger. Use your other hand 
to pinch up the skin around the injection site. Hold the skin 
firmly (see Figure K). 
• 
Do not touch the plunger head while inserting 
the needle into the skin. 
Step 12: Use a quick motion to fully insert the needle into 
the pinched skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle (see Figure L).  
Release the pinch of skin. Use that hand to hold the bottom 
of the syringe steady. Place the thumb of your other hand 
on the plunger head (see Figure L).

Step 13: Use your thumb to push in the plunger slowly and 
steadily as far as it will go to inject all the medicine 
(see Figure M). More pressure may be needed to inject all 
the medicine for the 10 mg and 20 mg strengths. 
Figure M 
Step 14: Slowly move your thumb up to release the plunger 
allowing the needle to automatically be covered by the 
syringe body (see Figure N). 
Figure N 
Treat injection site 
Step 15: Treat injection site (if needed). 
If you see drops of blood at the injection site, press a sterile 
cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and hold for 
about 10 seconds. You may cover the injection site with an 
adhesive bandage if needed. 
If more than one syringe is needed: 
Step 16: If your health care provider tells you to use more 
than one syringe for your dose, repeat Steps 4 to 15 listed 
above for each syringe that you use. 
• 
• 
Note: Do not inject multiple injections in the 
same spot. The injection sites should be at 
least 5 centimetres away from each other. See 
Step 6 for choosing an injection site. 
If multiple syringes are needed for a single 
dose, you should inject at the same time of 
day. Doses should not be divided over the 
course of the day 
AFTER THE INJECTION 
If your dose requires more 
than one syringe, repeat 
Steps 4 to 15 immediately for 
each syringe you use. 
Dispose of the used syringes 
Put your used needles and syringes in a sharps disposal or puncture-resistant container right away after 
use. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about the right way to throw away the container. Use 
safe disposal procedures for syringes.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE 
TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pegvaliase, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on diarrhoea and fatigue from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous 
reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between pegvaliase, fatigue and diarrhoea is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing pegvaliase should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegvaliase the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pegvaliase is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

1. 
Introduction 
Sitagliptin phosphate is an orally active, potent, selective inhibitor of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 
IV  (DPP-4)  and  the  first  of  a  new  therapeutic  class  of  drugs  intended  to  treat  patients  with  type  2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  DPP-4 inhibitors act by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones.  
These hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, 
are released from the intestine in response to a meal and are part of an endogenous system involved in 
glucose  homeostasis.    Sitagliptin  was  approved  for  marketing  in  the  EU  in  2007  and  currently  has 
therapeutic indications for second line use in combination with metformin, a PPAR-γ agonist (alone or 
in combination with metformin), or a sulfonylurea (alone or in combination with metformin). 
The  present  variation  was  filed  to  seek  the  indication  for  the  use  of  sitagliptin  as  monotherapy  in 
patients  with  T2DM.  Initially,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  proposed  to  amend  the 
indication  as  follows:  “For  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  Tesavel  is  indicated  to  improve 
glycaemic control when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control”. 
In  support  of  the  current  variation  application  results  were  presented  from  study  P049,  a  phase  III, 
multicenter,  double-blind,  randomised  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  MK-0431 
(sitagliptin)  compared  with  metformin  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  with  inadequate  glycaemic 
control. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed an additional modification to the currently approved indications (i.e., 
in  the  dual  combination  therapy  with  a  SU  deletion  of  "…when  metformin  is  inappropriate  due  to 
contraindications or intolerance"). 
The MAH also proposed changes to sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SPC in order to reflect the results 
of the mentioned study.

Non-Clinical aspects 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
The ERA submitted in the dossier for the current type II variation is an updated version of the ERA 
submitted by the MAH in the dossier of the initial application for Tesavel. 
In  Phase  I  the  MAH  calculated  a  PECsurfacewater  of  0.5  µg/L  under  the  assumption  of  a  Fpen  of  1%, 
which is above the trigger of 0.01 µg/L. Asthe PECsurface water is still larger than 10 ng/l, the MAH has 
provided an environmental risk assessment according to Phase II of the guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006). 
Sitagliptin  is  not  susceptible  to  photodegradation.  The  substance  is  hydrolytically  stable.  The  MAH 
stated a Kow of 0.6. There is no indication of a bioaccumulation potential. The Koc is less than 10,000 
(logKoc = 2.88), and therefore, an evaluation of the risk to the terrestrial compartment is not required.  
Sitagliptin is not readily biodegradable. The MAH submitted the results of a test on the aerobic and 
anaerobic  transformation  in  aquatic  sediment  systems  according  to  OECD  308.  According  to  these 
results the submission of a sediment toxicity test deemed necessary. The MAH provided the results of 
a sediment toxicity test according OECD 218.  
The  MAH  has  submitted  data  on  the  ecotoxicity  of  sitagliptin.  The  comparison  of  the  predicted 
concentration  in  surface  water  with  the  predicted  no  effect  concentration  did  not  result  in  risk 
quotients above 1 (for algae, fish and water flea) or 0.1 (for micro-organisms). The PECground  water to 
PNECdaphnia  risk  quotient  is  also  below  1.  The  MAH  did  not  provide  data  on  the  PECsediment  but 
stated “the results suggested that the drug substance is not toxic to sediment organisms”.  
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH was requested by the CHMP to submit a valid algae growth inhibition test (OECD 201). 
The MAH already committed in a previous variation procedure to provide the results of such test by 
July 2009.

Clinical aspects 
3.1 
A) 
Clinical efficacy 
Main study/Methods 
In support of this variation application results of one Phase III trial were submitted. Study P049 was a 
multicenter,  double-blind,  randomised,  parallel-group  Phase  III  non-inferiority  study  to  compare  the 
efficacy  of  100  mg/d  of  sitagliptin  with  2000  mg/d  of  metformin  in  patients  with  T2DM  who  had 
inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise alone. The study duration was 24 weeks. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferior efficacy of sitagliptin compared to metformin 
and to show that sitagliptin is well tolerated. The secondary objective was to show that the incidence 
of gastrointestinal adverse events is lower with sitagliptin than with metformin. 
Patient population 
Patients with T2DM who were drug-naïve or had not been treated with any antidiabetic medication for 
at least 4 months prior to screening were eligible.  Male and female patients who were ≥18 and ≤78 
years old with inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥6.5% and ≤9.0%) on diet and exercise therapy 
alone were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sitagliptin 100 mg or metformin. Patients with 
unstable  medical  conditions,  such  as  active  liver  disease,  and  patients  with  medical  conditions  that 
limited  the  use  of  metformin  (e.g.,  moderate  to  severe  renal  insufficiency)  were  excluded  from 
participation.  
Treatments 
The dosing regimen for metformin included a dose titration starting at 500 mg q.d., increasing by 500 
mg increments (approximately weekly) until the maximum daily dose of 1000 mg b.i.d. was achieved 
within 5 weeks.  Patients were to remain on 1000 mg b.i.d. for the remainder of this 24-week study. 
Down  titration  was  permitted  for  intolerance  to  a  minimum  allowed  dose  of  1000  mg/d.  If  after  6 
weeks  a  patient  was  unable  to  tolerate  at  least  1000  mg  of  metformin  daily,  he/she  had  to  be 
withdrawn  from  the  study.  During  the  active  treatment  period,  patients  not  meeting  progressively 
stricter  glycaemic  goals  were  provided  glycaemic  rescue  therapy  (glyburide  [glibenclamide])  until 
study completion.  
Concurrent lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications as well as thyroid hormone and hormone 
replacement therapy had to be stable during the double-blind phase. 
Endpoints and statistical analysis plan 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c.  A non-inferiority margin of 
0.4%  was  pre-specified.    Other  endpoints/objectives  included  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG),  the 
proportion of patients meeting glycaemic goals, and insulin, proinsulin, 1,5-anhydroglucitol, and lipid 
levels. 
The  primary  analysis  used  the  Per-Protocol  (PP)  population  based  upon  international  regulatory 
guidance regarding the primary analysis population for non-inferiority studies.  For analysis of change 
or  percent  change  from  baseline  at  Week  24,  the  PP  population  required  that  a  patient  had 
measurements  both  at  baseline  and  at  Week  24  and  did  not  have  any  major  protocol  violations.  
Protocol violators were identified prior to unblinding the data and excluded from the PP population. 
The  baseline  for  efficacy  analyses  was  defined  as  the  Visit  3/Week  0/Day  1  (randomisation) 
measurement.  The metformin treatment group was analyzed as a single group regardless of the actual 
dose  taken.  For  HbA1c  and  FPG  at  Week  24,  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  population  was  used  as  a 
secondary analysis population.  The FAS population consisted of all patients randomised who received 
at least one study dose, had a baseline measurement, and had at least one post-baseline measurement. 
The primary approach to handling missing data in the FAS population was the LOCF method. 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  address  the  primary  hypothesis,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  in  the 
sitagliptin group was compared with that in the metformin group using the least-squares (LS) means of 
the two treatment groups as estimated via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  The ANCOVA model 
included terms for treatment and baseline HbA1c value. Due to the large number of study centers and 
the small numbers of patients at each center, study center was not included as a factor in the analysis 
model. 
The  primary  non-inferiority  comparison  of  sitagliptin  to  metformin  used  a  non-inferiority  margin  of 
0.4%.  Non-inferiority was to have been declared if the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval 
of  the  treatment  effect  (sitagliptin  minus  metformin)  was  less  than  0.4%  in  terms  of  HbA1c.   
An  analysis  of  the  proportion  of  individuals  whose  HbA1c  values  met  glycaemic  goals  (<6.5%  as 
primary;  <7.0%  as  secondary)  at  Week  24  was  conducted  in  both  the  PP  and  the  FAS  populations, 
using a logistic regression model to compare the sitagliptin group to the metformin group. 
A schematic view of the study design is presented in Figure 1. 
FIGURE 1: STUDY DESIGN P049 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that,  in  general,  the  design  of  the  study  is  acceptable.  However,  the 
predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.4% is considered excessively large. Usually, the delta for non-
inferiority  is  chosen  on  the  basis  of  the  difference  in  effect  compared  with  placebo.  The  expected 
placebo-adjusted effect in this group of patients with relative low HbA1c (6.5-9) is < 0.8 % as this was 
the difference seen in study P021 (monotherapy) in patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8. In fact, 
mean  baseline  HbA1c  was  even  lower,  i.e.  7.2%,  in  study  P049.  Therefore,  a  lower  margin  would 
have been preferred. Furthermore, it is agreed that it was not useful to include study centre as a factor 
in the analysis.  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The  clinical  trial  was  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  has 
provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial, which included sites outside the community, 
was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Results 
B.1. 
Patient disposition, baseline data and demographics 
A total of 2092 patients were screened, and 1034 patients were excluded. The most common reason 
for not being randomized was for the patient not meeting HbA1c inclusion criterion.   
A total of 1058 patients participated in the study at 113 sites worldwide.  One study site was identified 
as  non-compliant  with  some  of  the  requirements  of  GCP;  for  this  reason,  data  from  the  8  patients 
randomised  at  this  site  were  deemed  unreliable  and  were  removed  from  all  analyses  (efficacy  and 
safety).   
Of the 1050 patients randomised, 917 patients completed the study. Reasons for discontinuation were 
generally similar between treatment groups (Table 1). Slightly more patients in the sitagliptin group 
(N=10,  1.9%)  than  in  the metformin  group  (N=3,  0.6%) discontinued  due  to lack  of  efficacy  which 
included  patients  not  meeting  the  progressively  stricter  protocol-specified  glycaemic  criteria  and/or 
not meeting the investigator’s expectations of glycaemic improvement. More patients in the metformin 
group  (N=19,  3.6%)  than  in  the  sitagliptin  group  (N=9,  1.7%)  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse 
experience.  Only  one  patient  in  the  metformin  group  was  prematurely  unblinded  due  to  an  AE  of 
increased liver enzymes. 
The study report states that compliance to study drug exceeded 98% in both treatment groups.

Similar  proportions  of  patients  completed  the  study  according  to  protocol  and  were  included  in  the 
primary efficacy analysis, i.e. 86.2% and 84.1% in the sitagliptin and metformin group, respectively. 
The  mean  age  of  the  randomised  population  was  56.0  years,  46.1%  were  males,  mean  duration  of 
diabetes was 2.4 years, and the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.2%.  At study entry all patients had to be 
on diet and exercise therapy without any antidiabetic therapy for at least four months as specified in 
the  protocol.    Thirty  (30;  5.7%)  and  26  (5.0%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  and  metformin  group, 
respectively,  were  previously  treated  with  an  antidiabetic  drug.  In  most  cases  metformin  was  used 
(3.5%  in  both  groups).  Of  the  randomised  patients,  41.8%  had  baseline  HbA1c  values  <7.0%  and 
17.2%  had  baseline  HbA1c  values  ≥8.0%.  The  most  common  specific  secondary  diagnoses  were 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and dyslipidaemia.  
Slightly more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to lack of efficacy, while more patients 
in  the  metformin  group  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  experience.  There  were  no  significant 
differences between groups with respect to baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics. 
About 5% of patients were previously treated with antidiabetic agents, in most cases with metformin. 
Some  patients  must  have  received  combination  treatment,  as  the  sum  of  percentages  of  individual 
drugs  was  higher  than  the  total  percentage.  Seeing  the  mean  diabetes  duration  of  2.4  years  and  the 
range it is surprising that only 5% of patients were pretreated, or that a patient was not treated for up to 
30 years. On the other hand, HbA1c in this group of patients was rather low (7.2%) at baseline. This 
stresses the importance of a well chosen delta even more. 
B.2.  HbA1c reduction (primary endpoint) 
Table 3 and Figure 2 show results of the primary efficacy analysis. Reductions in HbA1c at Week 24 
were  observed  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  criterion  for  declaring  sitagliptin  non-inferior  to 
metformin in the test of the primary hypothesis was met: the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for 
the  mean  difference  between  sitagliptin  and  metformin,  0.21%,  was  less  than  the  prespecified  non-
inferiority margin of 0.40%. 
Two  additional  supportive  analyses  conducted  in  the  FAS  population  were  also  consistent  with  the 
primary  analysis:    ANCOVA  (Table  4  and  Figure  3)  and  the  repeated  measures  analysis  (Table  5), 
which were used as supplementary approaches to handle missing data.

Proportions of patients with Week 24 HbA1c values below 6.5% (primary) and 7.0 % (secondary) in 
the  PP  population  are  shown  in  Table  6  and  Table  7.  Slightly  greater  proportions  of  patients  in  the 
metformin group relative to the sitagliptin group had an HbA1c <6.5% and <7.0% at Week 24.  Results 
were similar in the FAS population.

The primary and secondary efficacy results and the drop out rates due to lack of efficacy suggest that 
sitagliptin is less effective than metformin. The difference in HbA1c reduction between sitagliptin and 
metformin was 0.14 (0.06, 0.21 at 24 weeks with differences increasing over time. In the light of the 
overall small treatment effect, i.e. HbA1c decrease from baseline of 0.43% and 0.57% in the sitagliptin 
and  metformin  group,  respectively,  the  chosen  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.40%  is  considered  too 
generous  and  the  observed  treatment  differences  cannot  easily  be  interpreted.  Proportion  of  patients 
with HbA1c value <6.5% and < 7.0% at week 24 was also less (33.6 vs. 39.2% and 68.8 vs. 75.9%, 
respectively).  
The  inclusion  primarily  of  patients  with  a  rather  low  baseline  HbA1c  (mean  7.2%)  limits  the 
generalizability of the study results. About 50% of the screened patients were considered non-eligible 
mainly due to HbA1c values out of inclusion range. . Patients with higher HbA1c levels could have 
easily been included in this active-controlled trial. 
According to the study report, 96.4% of patients in the metformin group of the PP population reached 
the  maximum  protocol-specified total  daily  dose  of metformin  of  2000  mg  during  the  course  of the 
study  and  approximately  88%  were  taking  this  dose  at  Week  24.  This  is  considered  adequate  for  a 
valid comparison of efficacy.

Since the difference in HbA1c appeared to widen over time, 12 month comparative monotherapy data 
as  previously  submitted  for  other  antidiabetic  agents  seeking  monotherapy  indications  would  have 
been useful.  
The assumption that sitagliptin is less effective than metformin is further supported by results from a 
previous  study,  P036,  although  it  should  be  mentioned  that  the  direct  comparison  of  sitagliptin  and 
metformin was not the objective of this study. 
P036,  was  a  double-blind  factorial  study  of  the  co-administration  of  sitagliptin  (MK-0431)  and 
metformin  in  patients  with  Type  2  Diabetes  Mellitus  who  have  inadequate  glycaemic  control.  
This study has already been assessed during the evaluation for the initial Marketing Authorisation of 
the  product. Table  8 and  Figure  4  present  a summary  of the efficacy  results suggesting  that in   this 
T2DM population  - with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.7% - sitagliptin 100 qd was similarly effective 
as metformin 500 mg bid but less effective than metformin 1000 mg bid.

Subgroup analyses 
Between-group  treatment  differences  were  generally  consistent  across  subgroups  defined  by  gender, 
race, ethnicity, baseline HbA1c, age, BMI, duration of diabetes and region. Between-group treatment 
estimates  in  each  prespecified  subgroup  centered  around  the  overall  between-group  treatment 
difference with overlapping 95% confidence intervals.  
An effect of baseline HbA1c level was observed within each treatment group. As baseline HbA1c level 
increased, the (Least Squares) LS mean reduction from baseline increased for both treatment groups. 
LS  Mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.19  (-0.27,  -0.11)  and  -0.26  (-0.34,  -0.17),  respectively,  for 
sitagliptin and metformin groups with baseline HbA1c <7.0%; -0.39 (-0.48, -0.31) and -0.61 (-0.70, -
0.53) for sitagliptin and metformin groups with baseline HbA1c between 7.0% and 8.0%; -1.13 (-0.26, 
-0.99) and -1.24 (-1.38, -1.11) for sitagliptin  and metformin groups with baseline HbA1c ≥ 8.0%.  
The CHMP was of the view that data again suggest that sitagliptin is less effective than metformin. 
B.4. 
Fasting Plasma glucose 
With  regards to the results  of  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG) for the  PP  population  at  week  24,  both 
treatment  groups  exhibited  similar  trends,  beginning  with  a  drop  in  the  first  6  weeks  followed  by 
stable levels for the remainder of the study. Treatment with metformin resulted in a larger reduction in 
FPG relative to treatment with sitagliptin. The ANCOVA analysis conducted on the FAS population 
showed a similar trend as seen in the PP analysis. 
11
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B.5.  Other efficacy parameters 
Results  on  other  efficacy  parameters  such  as  fasting  insulin,  proinsulin,  HOMA-β,  HOMA-IR  and 
lipid  panel  were  consistent  with  the  findings  described  above,  with  sitagliptin  slightly  but  not 
significantly less effective compared to metformin. 
C) 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Although  the  results  from  study  P049  meet  the  predefined  criterion  for  non-inferiority,  all  data, 
including  data  on  HbA1c,  responder  rates,  FPG  and  drop  out  rate  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,    do  not 
unequivocally demonstrate non-inferior efficacy. In addition, there is some evidence from the previous 
study P036 that sitagliptin 100 mg/d is less effective than metformin 1000 mg bid. 
Importantly,  the  inclusion  of  primarily  patients  with  a  rather  low  baseline  HbA1c  (mean  7.2%) 
artificially  increases  the  probability  of  finding  non-inferiority,  because  this  will  lead  to  smaller 
possible  HbA1c  reductions.  Thus,  patients  with  higher  HbA1c  levels  should  have  been  included  to 
improve  the  assay  sensitivity  of  this  study.  This  would  also  increase  the  generalisability  of  the 
findings. 
Consequently, the CHMP was of the opinion that although the upper margin of the 95% confidence 
interval  is  below  0.40  %,  the  results  do  not  convincingly  show  that  sitagliptin  is  non-inferior  to 
metformin. In addition, the differences between sitagliptin and metformin appear to widen over time 
and  12-month  comparative  data  would  have  been  preferable  to  demonstrate  maintenance  of  effect. 
Comparative data with alternatives for metformin, such as SUs, are not available for the monotherapy 
indication and in combination treatment with metformin non-inferior efficacy of sitagliptin compared 
to SU was not unequivocally proven. This was considered as a major objection. 
In  their  response  to  this  CHMP  major  objection,  the  MAH  stated  that  the  treatment  difference  in 
change in HbA1c between sitagliptin and metformin was similar in patients with rather low baseline 
HbA1c and patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels. However, the data presented suggests that the 
difference was greater in the group with HbA1c levels between 7.0 and 8.0%.  
Based on these data the design of the study with the non-inferiority margin of 0.4%, and thus of about 
the  same  size  as  the  observed  mean  sitagliptin  effect  (-0.43%  in  HbA1c  from  baseline),  is 
questionable. The sensitivity of the study to demonstrate non-inferiority is questioned.  
On the other hand, the HbA1c subgroup analysis revealed that the HbA1c reduction was larger with 
increasing baseline HbA1c values in both treatment groups as is usually observed with other glucose-
lowering  agents.  In  addition,  the  upper  margin  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  treatment  difference  for  the 
subgroup with baseline HbA1c > 8% was 0.3%, which provides sufficient confidence that sitagliptin is 
able to appropriately reduce blood glucose levels also in patients with higher baseline HbA1c.

As mentioned above, the CHMP noted that the difference in HbA1c appeared to widen over time, and 
was  of  the  view  that  12-month  comparative  monotherapy  data  would  have  been  informative.  Study 
P049 did not have an extension phase. However, the MAH argued that comparative data out to 2 years 
are  available  from  study  P036.  In  that  study,  initial  therapy  with  the  combination  of  sitagliptin  and 
metformin  was  compared  to  treatment  with  placebo,  metformin  alone,  and  sitagliptin  alone.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, eligible patients entered 
a continuation phase to 54 weeks and, at 54 weeks, eligible patients remained blinded and entered an 
extension phase for a total of 104 weeks of study. Increasingly stricter glycaemic rescue criteria were 
implemented to avoid prolonged exposure to hyperglycaemia. As depicted below, for those patients in 
the  monotherapy  treatment  groups  who  entered  the  extension  phase  (Figure  6),  efficacy  was 
maintained  through  104  weeks  in  both  the  sitagliptin  and  metformin  arms  of  the  study,  with  little 
apparent difference in the treatment effect between the 2 medications.

The MAH acknowledged that metformin is the first-line agent in the treatment of T2DM. Noting the 
small but statistically significant between-group difference in favour of metformin in study P049, the 
MAH proposed a restricted monotherapy indication for sitagliptin, i.e. in patients for whom metformin 
is not an option due to either contraindication or intolerance. 
3.2  Clinical safety 
The  safety  analyses  used  the  All-Patients-as-Treated  (APaT)  population.    The  APaT  population 
included  all  randomised  patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the  double-blind  study  therapy.   
The metformin treatment group was analyzed as a single group regardless of the actual dose taken. 
Safety  and  tolerability  were  assessed  by  a  review  of  all  safety  parameters  including  adverse 
experiences, laboratory safety parameters, body weight and vital signs.  A tiered approach was used 
for  the  analysis  of  safety  parameters.  Tier  1  adverse  experiences  were  pre-specified  and  included 
hypoglycaemia  and  selected  gastrointestinal  (GI)  events  (abdominal  pain  [including  abdominal 
discomfort], diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting). Inferential p-values were obtained from analyses of Tier 
1 clinical adverse experiences. Comparisons of proportions of patients were performed using Fisher’s 
exact test and confidence intervals for the between-group differences used the Wilson score method.  
For adverse experiences not in Tier 1 and predefined limits of change (PDLC) in laboratory variables, 
summary tabulations and 95% confidence intervals for between-group differences were calculated for 
events  in  Tier  2,  defined  as  having  an  incidence  of  1%  or  more  in  at  least  one  treatment  group; 
otherwise  (i.e.,  Tier  3),  only  summary  tabulations  were  generated.    For  monitoring  the  profile  of 
continuous  laboratory  parameters,  body  weight  and  vital  signs,  summary  tabulations  of  descriptive 
statistics and mean change from baseline plots over time were provided. 
The secondary safety hypothesis comparing the incidence of selected GI adverse experiences between 
treatment groups was tested using an ordering of the GI adverse experiences.  To limit the inflation of 
the  trial-wise  Type  I  error,  a  prespecified  multiplicity  adjustment  was  conducted  with  sitagliptin 
compared with metformin as follows:  (1) diarrhoea compared and if significant, (2) nausea compared 
and if significant, (3) abdominal pain (including abdominal discomfort) compared and if significant, 
(4) vomiting  compared.    The  individual  tests  were  conducted  at  the  two-sided  0.05  (or  0.025)  level 
using Fisher's exact test if the primary efficacy hypothesis of non-inferiority was met (or not met). 
14
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A) Patient exposure 
The  mean  duration  of  exposure  was  generally  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.    The  mean 
duration  of  patient  exposure  to  sitagliptin  100  mg  was  155.7  days.    For  the  metformin  group 
(cumulative, on any dose to which the patient was exposed) the mean duration of patient exposure was 
151.6 days.  
Dose of metformin 
For patients randomised to treatment with metformin, the starting dose was 500 mg/day, administered 
once-daily in the morning.  The dose of metformin was to have been up-titrated to a maximum dose of 
2000 mg/per day (administered as 1000 mg twice-daily) over the initial 5 weeks of the double-blind 
treatment  period.    The  mean  dose  of  metformin  after  Visit  4/Week  6  in  the-per  protocol  (PP) 
population was 1903.2 mg/day.  During the course of the study, 96.4% of patients in the metformin 
group of the PP population reached the maximum protocol-specified total daily dose of metformin of 
2000 mg.  At week 24 approximately 88% of patients in the metformin group in both the PP and the 
APaT populations were taking 2000 mg/day and only 7.7% were taking doses < 1500 mg. 
B) Adverse events 
leading 
to  discontinuation,  and  drug-related  adverse  experiences 
The  adverse  experience  profile  is  summarized  by  treatment  group  in  Table  8.  A  slightly  higher 
incidence  of  overall  adverse  experiences  was  observed  in  the  metformin  group  compared  with  the 
sitagliptin  group.  Additionally,  higher  incidences  of  drug-related  adverse  experiences,  adverse 
to 
experiences 
discontinuation  were  reported  in  the  metformin  group,  primarily  due  to  a  higher  rate  of  GI  adverse 
experiences in this group. 
The  incidences  of  drug-related  adverse  experiences  and  drug-related  adverse  experiences  leading  to 
discontinuation were lower in the sitagliptin group compared with the metformin group. For all other 
summary measures, the incidence of adverse experiences was low and generally similar between both 
groups.

The  distribution  of  patients  with  adverse  experiences  by  system  organ  class  (SOC)  with  the  pre-
specified  analysis  providing  95%  CIs  for  the  between-group  differences  is  presented  in  Table  9. 
Adverse  experiences  by  SOC  were  reported  most  frequently  for  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Infections 
and  Infestations,  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders,  and  Nervous  System  Disorders.   
A  greater  incidence  of  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  adverse  experiences  was  reported  for  the  metformin 
group relative to the sitagliptin group (primarily due to increased incidences of diarrhoea and nausea).   
In  addition  to  the  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  SOC,  a  higher  incidence  of  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and 
Mediastinal Disorders adverse experiences was reported in the metformin relative to the sitagliptin group 
(primarily due to the increased incidence of cough), for which the between-group difference around the 
15
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
95%  CI  excluded  “0”.    There  was  a  numerically  lower  incidence  of  Infection  and  Infestations  SOC 
adverse experiences for the sitagliptin group. 
For  those  SOCs  with  higher  incidences  of  adverse  experiences  observed  in  the  sitagliptin  group 
compared with the metformin group, the differences between groups were small (≤2.0%), and the 95% 
CIs  included  "0".    There  was  a  small,  numerically  greater  incidence  of  cardiac  SOC  adverse 
experiences reported for the sitagliptin group (2.5% vs. 1.5%); this difference was due to a range of 
cardiac-related  adverse  experiences,  and  the  incidence  of  serious  cardiac  SOC  adverse  experiences 
was  lower  for  the  sitagliptin  group  relative  to  the  metformin  group.  The  incidence  of  drug-related 
cardiac SOC adverse experiences was higher for the sitagliptin group relative to the metformin group. 
Incidences of ischaemia-related cardiac adverse experiences were similar in each treatment group. 
The  specific  adverse  events  which  occurred  with  a  numerically  greater  incidence  in  the  sitagliptin 
group  included  hypertension,  pain  in  extremity,  constipation,  and  dizziness.    These  adverse 
experiences  were  generally  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  self-limited,  not  recurrent  (i.e.,  generally 
reflected only 1 event and not repeated events) and resolved while patients continued on study therapy.  
For the adverse experiences of hypertension, the majority of patients with a reported event had pre-
existing hypertension and/or increased blood pressure prior to randomisation. 
B.1.  Deaths, serious adverse experiences, and other important safety events 
One  death  was  reported  in  the  sitagliptin  group  and  none  was  reported  in  the  metformin  group.   
The  death  in  the  sitagliptin  group  was  due  to  metastatic  lung  cancer  with  onset  at  Study  Day  15.   
This adverse experience was not considered by the investigator to be related to study therapy. 
The overall incidences of non-fatal serious adverse experiences reported to occur during the study was 
similar between groups: 9 patients in the sitagliptin group versus 8 in the metformin group. Specific 
events  were  distributed  throughout  numerous  body  systems.    Few  non-fatal  serious  adverse  
experiences  resulted  in  discontinuation  from  the  study:    3  in  the  sitagliptin  group  (tibia  fracture, 
hypoglycaemia,  and  gastroenteritis,  with  the  latter  occurring  2  days  after  the  patient's  last  dose  of 
sitagliptin), and 3 in the metformin group (upper respiratory tract infection, malignant melanoma, and 
multiple  endocrine  adenomatosis  type  II).    One  event  (hypoglycaemia  occurring  in  a  patient  in  the 
sitagliptin group) was considered drug-related. 
There  were  9  (1.7%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  19  (3.6%)  patients  in  the 
metformin  group  who  were  discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  adverse  experiences.    The  largest 
between-group  difference  resulted  from  discontinuations  due  to  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  in  the 
metformin group (1.9%) relative to the sitagliptin group (0.2%).  Three patients in each group were 
discontinued due to non-fatal serious adverse experiences. 
There  were  3  (0.6%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  12  (2.3%)  patients  in  the 
metformin group who were discontinued due to a drug-related adverse event.  In the sitagliptin group, 
all drug-related events that resulted in discontinuation were adverse experiences of hypoglycaemia and 
are further described below. Of the 12 patients who were discontinued due to drug-related events in 
the metformin group, 10 patients discontinued due to gastrointestinal adverse experiences (including 
diarrhoea  [6],  abdominal  pain  [1],  abdominal  distension  [1],  dyspepsia  [1],  and  dry  mouth  [1]);  the 
other two patients discontinued for dehydration and headache.

B.2.  Hypoglycaemia 
Symptomatic  episodes  assessed  as  likely  to  be  hypoglycaemia  were  reported  by  investigators  as 
adverse  experiences  of  hypoglycaemia;  a  concurrent  glucose  measurement  was  not  required.  
However, patients were counselled to obtain fingerstick glucose values if possible when symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia  occurred.   Additional information,  including  available  blood  glucose  determinations, 
was to have been collected for each event in order to better categorize episodes as noted below.   
No patient in this study was reported to have an episode of hypoglycaemia with marked severity, i.e., 
with symptoms of a markedly depressed level of consciousness, loss of consciousness, or seizure.  
Nine  (1.7%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  were  reported  to  have  17  episodes  of  hypoglycaemia 
compared  to  17  (3.3%)  patients  in  the  metformin  group  who  were  reported  to  have  23  episodes.   
The  between-group  differences  in  the  incidences  of  hypoglycaemia  were  not  statistically  significant 
for  the  comparisons  of  episodes  of  any  type:  episodes  requiring  non-medical  assistance  and  not 
exhibiting marked severity, and episodes requiring medical assistance or exhibiting marked severity. 
Three  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  were  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  experience  of 
hypoglycaemia;  these  events  were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  study  therapy.   
Two of the 3 patients in the sitagliptin group were reported to have an event of hypoglycaemia that 
required  medical  assistance  (1  of  these  2  patients'  events  was  precipitated  by  a  missed  meal); 
fingerstick  blood  glucose  values  associated  with  these  events  were  52  mg/dL  and  54  mg/dL  (2.9 
mmol/dL and 3.0 mmol/dL), respectively. 
B.3. 
Selected Gastrointestinal Adverse Experiences 
The  selected  gastrointestinal  adverse experiences  prespecified for  additional statistical  analysis  were 
diarrhoea,  nausea,  abdominal  pain  (including  abdominal  discomfort),  and  vomiting.    The  incidence 
was  significantly  lower  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the  metformin  group  for  diarrhoea 
(p<0.001) and nausea (p=0.032).  In addition, there were numerically lower incidences of abdominal 
pain  (including  abdominal  discomfort)  and  vomiting  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the 
metformin group.  In addition to the prespecified gastrointestinal adverse experiences, there was also a 
higher incidence of dyspepsia in the metformin group. 
B.4. 
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
Across  all  laboratory  chemistry  and  haematology  analytes,  the  frequency  of  results  meeting  PDLC 
criteria was generally similar in the sitagliptin and metformin groups. 
No clinically meaningful differences in mean changes from baseline in blood pressure and pulse rate 
were observed for either treatment group. 
There was a mean decrease in body weight observed in both sitagliptin and metformin groups (-0.6 kg 
vs.  -1.9  kg),  with  a  greater  decrease  observed  in  the  metformin  group.  No  statistical  analysis  was 
performed. 
C) 
Discussion on clinical safety 
In  general,  both  sitagliptin  and  metformin  were  well  tolerated.  No  unexpected  adverse  experiences 
were  observed.  More  gastrointestinal  adverse  experiences  were  seen  with  metformin.  There  was  a 
small,  numerically  greater incidence  of  cardiac  SOC adverse experiences reported  for the  sitagliptin 
group; the incidence of serious cardiac SOC adverse experiences was lower for the sitagliptin group 
relative  to  the  metformin  group  and  the  incidence  of  drug-related  cardiac  SOC  adverse  experiences 
was higher for the sitagliptin group relative to the metformin group. Of note, incidences of ischaemia-
related  cardiac  adverse  experiences  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  MAH  had  already 
committed to perform a cardiovascular outcome study at the time of marketing authorisation, which is 
ongoing at the moment. The most recent PSUR is covering the period 04 February 2008 to 03 August 
2008. The MAH should closely monitor cases of cardiac disorders.

Although  the  overall  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  or  number  of  hypoglycaemic  episodes  was 
numerically  higher  for  metformin,  2  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  required  medical  assistance  for 
hypoglycaemia. This contradicts the assumption of strict blood-glucose dependent action of sitagliptin. 
Previous safety concerns regarding a sitagliptin-related propensity to infections were not confirmed in 
this study, which is reassuring. 
No new safety issues were identified in study P049. However, long-term safety of sitagliptin still has 
to be established.  
Additionally, the cardiovascular safety has not been established for this class of drugs. In this regards, 
the MAH has analyzed pooled data from 12 large Phase II / III randomized, controlled, double-blind 
clinical trials of sitagliptin up to 2 years in duration. According to the MAH, there were no meaningful 
differences  in  total  or  serious  adverse  experiences.  Although  the  studies  in  this  analysis  were  not 
designed as cardiovascular outcome trials, but rather designed as trials assessing the overall safety and 
efficacy  of  sitagliptin  100  mg/day  in  various  treatment  paradigms,  no  meaningful  differences  were 
observed between the two groups in the incidence rates of cardiac-related or ischemia-related adverse 
experiences.  The  MAH  has  started  enrolling  patients  into  a  cardiovascular  safety  trial  (P082)  using 
adjudicated endpoints. This study expects to enrol approximately 14,000 patients and is scheduled to 
be completed in 2014. 
D) 
Risk Management plan 
The MAH claimed that an updated RMP will not be required for this variation. As a consequence an 
updated RMP was not submitted as part of this variation. 
The CHMP was of the view that due to use as monothereapy the population might change, most likely 
to patients with less co-morbidity. However, there are no additional safety concerns with monotherapy 
as compared to the combination therapy. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that there is no need to update 
the RMP. 
4. 
Benefit risk assessment and overall conclusion 
In support of the variation, results of one trial were submitted. Study P049 was a multicenter, double-
blind, randomised, parallel-group Phase III non-inferiority study to compare the efficacy of 100 mg/d 
of  sitagliptin  with  2000  mg/d  of  metformin  in  patients  with  T2DM  who  had  inadequate  glycaemic 
control on diet and exercise alone. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferior efficacy of 
sitagliptin compared to metformin on the basis of change in HbA1c (non-inferiority margin 0.4%) and 
to show that sitagliptin is well tolerated. The secondary objective was to show that the incidence of 
gastrointestinal adverse events is lower with sitagliptin than with metformin. 
More  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  (10/532,  1.9%)  as  compared  to  the  metformin  group  (1/526, 
0.2%) withdrew due to lack of efficacy. The reduction in HbA1c was -0.43 in the sitagliptin group vs -
0.57  %  in  the  metformin  group  (difference  0.14  [-0.06,  0.21]).  Responder  data  also  suggest  lower 
efficacy  for  sitagliptin  (69%  vs  76%  with  HbA1c  <7.0%,  sitagliptin  vs  metformin).  In  addition, 
metformin reduced fasting plasma glucose levels significantly more than sitagliptin (95% CI excludes 
0). 
The  MAH  claims  non-inferior  efficacy  for  sitagliptin  compared  to  metformin.  However,  because 
patients with rather low baseline HbA1c (≥ 6.5 and ≤9.0%) were included, the sensitivity of the study 
to demonstrate non-inferiority is questionable. The margin of 0.4% appears too large and is of about 
the same size as the mean HbA1c reduction achieved with sitagliptin. On the other hand, the HbA1c 
subgroup analysis revealed that HbA1c reduction was larger with increasing baseline HbA1c values in 
both treatment groups as observed with other glucose-lowering agents. In addition, the upper margin 
of  the  95%  CI  of  the  treatment  difference  for  the  subgroup  with  baseline  HbA1c  >  8%  was  0.3%, 
19
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which  provides  sufficient  confidence  that  sitagliptin  is  able  to  appropriately  reduce  blood  glucose 
levels also in patients with higher baseline HbA1c  
With respect to safety, sitagliptin had a better gastrointestinal profile compared to metformin.  
The MAH acknowledged that metformin is the first-line agent in the treatment of T2DM. Noting the 
small but statistically significant between-group difference in favour of metformin in study P049, the 
MAH proposed a restricted monotherapy indication for sitagliptin, i.e. in patients for whom metformin 
is  not  an  option  due  to  either  contraindication  or  intolerance.  However,  main  contraindications  for 
metformin  are  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  heart  failure  and  recent 
myocardial  infarction.  These  are  conditions  for  which  there  is  limited  experience  for  sitagliptin. 
Intolerance  to  metformin  is  mainly  due  to  gastrointestinal  side  effects.  Because  of  its  better 
gastrointestinal  tolerability,  sitagliptin  may  be  a  relevant  treatment  alternative.  It  should  also  be 
recognised that in the product information of Tesavel contraindications are limited to hypersensitivity 
reactions and that so far no major safety issues have appeared in those patients in whom metformin is 
contraindicated.  
For the monotherapy indication there is no direct comparison with a SU. In a comparative study with 
glipizide on top of metformin, sitagliptin had a significant and clinically relevant effect on glycaemic 
control but, due to the rather low dose of SU used in this trial, non-inferior efficacy compared to SU 
had  not  convincingly  been  proven.  Although  final  conclusions  are  difficult  to  reach,  it  seems  that, 
although a similar effect was noted on HbA1c, the effect of Tesavel is somewhat less, as measured by 
the  number  of  discontinuations.  On  the  other  hand,  as  pointed  out  by  the  MAH,  significantly  fewer 
adverse  experiences  of  hypoglycemia  occurred  compared  to  the  sulfonylurea  together  with  a  more 
favourable effect on bodyweight.  
So  far,  no  detrimental  effects  of  sitagliptin  have  been  identified.  A  cardiovascular  safety  study  is 
underway, which will monitor the long-term safety of sitagliptin in a large patient population with type 
2 diabetes. 
Taking all considerations together, the CHMP concluded that sitagliptin could be an alternative to SU 
(in patients not tolerating or with contraindications to metformin), in particular in those patients with a 
history of hypoglycaemia and who have weight problems. 
In summary based on the above considerations, the newly proposed restricted monotherapy indication 
for  sitagliptin,  i.e.  for  use  as  monotherapy  in  patients  for  whom  metformin  is  not  an  option,  due  to 
either contraindication or intolerance was considered acceptable.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Sibnayal is indicated for the treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) in adults, adolescents 
and children aged one year and older. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Dosing is based on age and weight.  
When initiating alkalising therapy, the target starting daily dose indicated below for each age group 
should be used and incrementally titrated to obtain the optimal dose that provides adequate metabolic 
acidosis control based on plasma bicarbonate levels.  
- 
- 
- 
- 
Adults: initiation at 1 mEq/kg/day, with a maximal incremental increase/decrease of 
0.5 mEq/kg/day to optimal dose  
Adolescents from 12 years: initiation at 1 mEq/kg/day, with a maximal incremental 
increase/decrease of 1.0 mEq/kg/day to optimal dose  
Children from 4 to 11 year inclusive: initiation at 2 mEq/kg/day, with a maximal incremental 
increase/decrease of 1.5 mEq/kg/day to optimal dose  
Children from 1 to 3 years inclusive: initiation at 4 mEq/kg/day, with a maximal incremental 
increase/decrease of 1.5 mEq/kg/day to optimal dose  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When switching from another alkalising therapy to Sibnayal, treatment should be initiated at the target 
dose used with the previous therapy (in mEq/kg/day) and titrated where necessary as described above. 
The maximum dose, regardless of the age group, is either 10 mEq/kg/day or a total daily dose of 
336 mEq, whichever is lower. 
The total daily dose should be administered in two intakes. For each individual patient, the nearest 
dose to the target dose should be fixed by combining whole sachets of the two available strengths.  
In case of vomiting within two hours after intake, the patient should take another dose. 
The use of this medicine requires medical supervision.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required.  
Renal impairment 
Sibnayal should only be used in individuals with glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) > 44 mL/min/1.73m². For individuals with GFR between 45 and 59 mL/min/1.73m² Sibnayal 
should only be used if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks (see 
Table 1).

Treatment of dRTA 
45-59 
•  Plasma potassium levels in the normal ranges: 
A regular monitoring of renal function parameters and blood potassium 
levels is necessary at starting dose and after new dose increase or if any 
decrease of GFR. Then frequency is according to physicians´s criteria, but 
at least twice a year (see section 4.4). 
•  Elevated plasma potassium: 
Contraindicated 
≤ 44 
Contraindicated 
Hepatic impairment 
There is no need for specific target starting daily dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Sibnayal in children below one year of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration  
For oral use. 
The total daily dose is administered twice daily, typically twelve hours apart.  
Sibnayal must be taken orally, swallowed with a large glass of water.  
The full dose of granules per intake can be swallowed in several smaller portions if necessary, but the 
content of each sachet must be entirely taken. 
Doses should be taken preferably during meals.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients who are unable to swallow granules as described above, the granules may be mixed 
(without crushing) with small amounts of soft food (e.g., fruit puree, yoghurt). The Sibnayal soft food 
mixture must be used immediately and cannot be stored. The mixture should be swallowed without 
chewing. Care should be taken to ensure that Sibnayal is not retained in the mouth. 
In no instance granules must be mixed with hot food, hot liquid or alcohol or chewed or crushed as this 
can disrupt their prolonged release properties and may lead to large sudden release of alkalising agent 
that could affect product efficacy and safety (see section 5.2). 
Sibnayal granules are not suitable for administration via feeding tubes due to high risk of obstructing 
the tubes. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Renal impairment with GFR ≤ 44 mL/min/1.73m². 
Hyperkalaemia. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hyperkalaemia and cardiotoxicity 
Sibnayal should be used with caution in patients who have conditions pre-disposing them to 
hyperkalaemia, such as renal impairment, or crush syndrome, as a further rise in plasma potassium 
may lead to cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of plasma potassium in patients at risk is required at 
starting dose and after new dose increase or in case of worsening of pre-existing disease. Then 
frequency is according to physicians´s criteria, but at least twice a year.  
Sibnayal should be used with caution in case of combination with other products increasing plasma 
potassium or predisposing to cardiac dysrhythmia (see section 4.5). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Sibnayal should be used with caution in patients having gastro-intestinal disorders as they could affect 
efficacy and safety, such as malabsorption, delayed gastric emptying, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting.  
In such cases the blood bicarbonate levels should be regularly monitored and dose adjusted to maintain 
within normal ranges. 
The matrix of the granules can be found in the stools, which does not affect the efficacy or safety of 
Sibnayal. 
Renal insufficiency 
Sibnayal should only be used in individuals with glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) > 44 mL/min/1.73m². For individuals with GFR between 45 and 59 mL/min/1.73m² Sibnayal 
should only be used if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. For these 
patients doses should be adjusted by regular monitoring of plasma bicarbonate and potassium (see 
section 4.2). Special care should be taken in elderly people in whom renal function can be decreased. 
Potassium contents 
Sibnayal 8 mEq contains 308 mg of potassium per sachet. This is to be taken into consideration if the 
patient has a reduced kidney function or if the patient is on a controlled potassium diet.

Sibnayal 24 mEq contains 924 mg of potassium per sachet. This is to be taken into consideration if the 
patient has a reduced kidney function or if the patient is on a controlled potassium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Medicinal products that may increase plasma potassium or induce hyperkalaemia  
Concomitant use of Sibnayal with medicinal products that may increase potassium levels or induce 
hyperkalaemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt 
substitutes containing potassium, ciclosporin or other medicinal products such as heparin sodium or 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products) necessitates monitoring of potassium plasma 
levels (see section 4.4).  
Medicinal products affected by plasma potassium disturbances 
Periodic monitoring of plasma potassium and ECG is recommended when Sibnayal is administered 
with medicinal products affected by plasma potassium disturbances due to the potential risk for a pro-
arrhythmic effect (e.g. digitalis glycosides, corticosteroids, anti-arrhythmics such as quinidine, 
amiodarone, chlorpromazine, cisapride or sparfloxacine). 
Medicinal products affected by increased urine pH 
Patients with dRTA have alkaline urine due to their proton secretion defect. This may impact the 
excretion of the medicinal product into the urine (such as an increase of the elimination of salicylates, 
tetracyclines, and barbiturates and a decrease in the elimination of quinidine) or reduce the 
effectiveness of methenamine. As Sibnayal may further increase urine pH to a small extent, the 
interaction of alkaline urine with these medications may be enhanced.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Sibnayal in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or 
postnatal development (see section 5.3).  
Sibnayal should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
Although during pregnancy and more so during labour, there is more risk associated to a potentially 
severe acidosis and hypokalaemia in dRTA patients than to alkali treatment, in women with problem 
pregnancies there might be an increased risk to develop hyperkalemia when potassium intake is high.  
Breast-feeding 
Potassium is excreted in human milk, but at therapeutic doses of Sibnayal no effects on the breastfed 
newborns/infants are anticipated. 
Sibnayal can be used during breast-feeding.  
Fertility 
Potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate are not known to affect fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sibnayal has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are abdominal pain (14%, very common), upper 
abdominal pain (8%, common) and gastro-intestinal pain (2%, common). 
Nausea (2%, common) can be experienced at initiation of therapy. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The list of adverse reactions is based on the experience in clinical trials. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10) ; 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10) ; uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100) ; rare (≥1/10000 to <1/1000) and very 
rare (<1/10000). 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 
- 
- 
abdominal pain as very common 
abdominal pain upper, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal pain, 
nausea and vomiting as common.  
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastro-intestinal pain, abdominal pain and upper abdominal pain were generally of mild or moderate 
intensity and resolved within 24 hours without the need to modify or stop the treatment. All other gastro-
intestinal adverse reactions (dyspepsia, vomiting, diarrhoea) were also of mild or moderate intensity, 
and resolved within 1 to 3 days, without modification or interruption of treatment. 
Paediatric population 
In clinical trials, although numbers were small, the safety profile was comparable in treated patients 
for adults (N= 16 healthy subjects and 7 dRTA patients) and paediatric population (N=27, including 
10 adolescents (12-17 years old inclusive), 14 children (4-11 years old inclusive) and 3 infants 
(6 months – 3 years inclusive)). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of a laxative effect after excessive oral doses of individual alkalising salts have occurred. 
An acute massive intake of potassium can cause hyperkalaemia resulting in nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhoea and in severe cases paraesthesia, muscular weakness, mental confusion, electrocardiographic 
abnormalities (large and symmetric T waves), arrhythmia, atrioventricular block and heart failure. 
Hyperkalaemia is a particular concern in patients with underlying renal insufficiency. 
In case of severe hyperkalaemia, patients should be monitored (mostly plasma potassium level and 
ECG) and the appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy instituted in specialised care units, 
where emergency treatments leading to rapid elimination of potassium such as ion exchange resin,  
combination of insulin-dextrose or β2 mimetics (salbutamol) or haemodialysis will be implemented.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: mineral supplements, potassium, ATC code: A12BA30. 
Mechanism of action 
Sibnayal is a fixed-dose combination of potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate (also 
known as potassium bicarbonate) as prolonged release granules. 
The pharmacological properties are directly linked to the capacity of potassium citrate and potassium 
hydrogen carbonate to maintain electrolyte balance. Both act as alkalising agents and buffer the 
metabolic acidosis. Sibnayal provides a source of potassium to correct hypokalaemia. In addition, 
citrate acts also as a calcium chelating agent. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, incomplete crossover study in healthy 
adults, Sibnayal at doses ranging from 1.0 to 2.9 mEq/kg/day during 5 days was shown to increase 
urine pH (marker of alkalinising effect in healthy subjects) with a dose-proportional effect as 
compared to placebo. The effect was maintained over 12 hours at all the doses evaluated. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of Sibnayal for the treatment of dRTA was evaluated in a  multi-centre, open-
label, sequential study that included 37 patients with an established diagnosis of dRTA (7 adults, 
10 adolescents (12-17 years), 15 children (4-11 years), 5 infants (1-4 years)) who were being treated 
with their standard-of-care (SoC) short-acting alkalising agents in repeated daily intakes . Patients 
continued on their SoC for 5 days (n=35) and then received Sibnayal twice daily, initially during a 
titration period to establish the optimal dose (up to 30 days duration) and then for 5 days at this 
optimal dose (n=32).  
With Sibnayal, the primary endpoint showed that the mean (SD) plasma bicarbonate pre-dose level 
during 3 days of treatment at steady state was 23.1 (1.62) mmol/L with 90% (26/29) of the patients 
achieving 3-day mean normal bicarbonate levels. This effect was generally maintained during 24 
months of therapy, although some variability was observed with a responder rate of 56-92%. Mean 
achieved plasma potassium level was 4.0 (0.44) mmol/L with 83% (24/29) of the patients at normal 
levels. 
With SoC, the mean (SD) plasma bicarbonate pre-dose level during 3 days of treatment at steady state 
was 21.7 (3.06) mmol/L with 45% (13/29) of the patients at normal levels. The mean achieved plasma 
potassium level was 3.8 (0.44) mmol/L with 82% at normal levels.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Sibnayal is a prolonged-release granules formulation to cover a 12-hour treatment period after 
administration. 
Pharmacokinetic features of citrate, bicarbonate and potassium are based on the literature. 
Absorption 
Oral citrate is absorbed at a pH between 4.8 and 6.4 along the upper portion of the small intestine 
(duodenum, early part of jejunum). Under these conditions, the intestinal absorption of citrate is rapid 
and almost complete. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral bicarbonate is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Bicarbonate neutralises gastric acid 
with the production of CO2 eliminated by the respiratory route. Bicarbonate not involved in that 
reaction is rapidly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa.  
The potassium ions are fully absorbed, irrespective of the amount consumed. The majority of 
potassium absorption occurs in the small intestine, mainly through passive diffusion. 
Distribution and biotransformation 
Most of the citrate in the blood circulates unbound and the remaining quota is complexed to calcium, 
potassium or sodium. The citrate ion from oral alkali citrates undergoes oxidative metabolic 
breakdown to carbon dioxide (CO2) or bicarbonate. Consequently, a basifying effect is associated with 
its metabolism. Ingestion of 36 mmol of citrate (i.e. 108 mEq) is equivalent to less than 2% of the 
daily turnover of citrate involved in energy metabolism within the body. 
The absorbed bicarbonate is distributed like the endogenous bicarbonate in the intracellular and 
extracellular compartments of the organism. Bicarbonate is not really metabolised. However, 
bicarbonate is in equilibrium with hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide and, through its concentration, 
regulates the acid-base balance.  
Potassium is carried from extracellular fluids to the intracellular fluids, and its distribution between 
cells is tightly controlled, with only 1.5–2.5% of total body potassium found in the extracellular fluid. 
A large proportion of the body burden of potassium (98%) is found in muscle and the skeleton, and it 
is also present in high concentrations in the blood, central nervous system, intestine, liver, lung and 
skin. An active ion transport system maintains the gradient across the plasma membrane. 
Elimination 
Citrate is mainly eliminated by the renal route. In its trivalent form, it is filtered freely through the 
renal glomerulus. Dietary alkali absorption increases citrate excretion by inhibiting its reabsorption at 
the mitochondrial level and by increasing its secretion by the nephron.  
Bicarbonate provides an alkali load and therefore stimulates an increase in urinary excretion of citrate. 
Increased excretion of bicarbonate in the urine also occurs. Bicarbonate can also be partially 
eliminated by the respiratory route (in the form of CO2). The major excretory route of potassium is via 
the kidneys (90%). The rest is eliminated in the faeces and small amounts may also be excreted in 
sweat. 
Special population 
Pharmacokinetics of potassium can be modified in patients with renal impairment for whom 
glomerular filtration of potassium is less active, in cardiac patients who present a susceptibility to 
hyperkalaemia and in adrenocortical patients for whom the risk of hyperkalaemia is accentuated. 
Pharmacokinetics of citrate, bicarbonate and/or potassium can be modified in patients with gastro-
intestinal issues (e.g. malabsorption, delayed gastric emptying, oesophageal compression, intestinal 
obstruction or other chronic gastro-intestinal disease) that could modify absorption. 
Pharmacokinetics should not be modified in patients with hepatic impairment, or in patients with 
overweight or obesity. 
Interaction with alcohol 
When Sibnayal is mixed with alcohol in vitro, the rate of dissolution of the granules increases and can 
occur rapidly leading to a loss of the prolonged-effect (see section 4.2).

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveals no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.

1.  What Sibnayal is and what it is used for 
Sibnayal contains two active substances, potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate (also 
known as potassium bicarbonate).  
Sibnayal is an alkalising medicine that is used to control blood acidity caused by a kidney disease 
called distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).  
Sibnayal will help reduce the effect of dRTA on your everyday life. 
Sibnayal is used in adults, adolescents and children above 1 year. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Sibnayal 
Do not take Sibnayal if: 
- 
- 
- 
you are allergic to potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6),

you have a high level of potassium in your blood (hyperkalaemia). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Sibnayal if: 
- 
you have a disease or you take a medicine that can increase your blood potassium (see below “Other

granules. You may see remains of the granules in your stools. This is normal and does not reduce the 
effectiveness of the medicine. 
If you vomit within two hours after intake, you should take another dose. 
You will need regular appointments with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do 
blood, urine or heart tests, to adjust the dose of Sibnayal. Your doctor will regularly check your kidney 
function if you are elderly and/or have worsening kidney function.

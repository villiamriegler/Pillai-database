1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted the final results of the local non-interventional post-marketing surveillance 
study, CEP2006JP01, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 1901/2006. 
Study CEP2006JP01, a drug-use result survey, was conducted in Japan as post-marketing surveillance 
of the filgrastim biosimilar  Zarzio/ Filgrastim Hexal (for which EP2006 is the MAH’s internal code that 
is used throughout this document) with the aim to collect information on safety and efficacy in the 
clinical setting to ensure effective and safe use of the product in the following 4 indications that are in 
line with the approved indications in the EU (see Zarzio SmPC): I. Mobilization of hematopoietic stem 
cells into peripheral blood (excluding healthy donors); II.  Promotion of increasing neutrophil count at 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; III. Neutropenia due to cancer chemotherapy; and IV. 
Neutropenia interfering with the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
One patient in the study was a paediatric patient with age less than 18 years. Therefore, the final 
results of the study, more specifically the efficacy and safety data of the single paediatric patient in the 
study, are submitted as post-authorisation measure (“stand-alone”) application under Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which sets out the obligation for MAHs to submit any MAH-sponsored 
studies involving the use of an authorized medicinal product in the paediatric population to the 
competent authority, whether or not they are part of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). No update of 
the product information (PI) is proposed based on the data collected for the single paediatric patient 
included in the study. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information  on the development  program 
In this report are described the efficacy and safety data of a single paediatric patient in the drug-use 
result survey CEP2006JP01 that was conducted as post-marketing surveillance in Japan. 
Further, the safety results of the total study population are reported briefly and commented from a 
pharmacovigilance point of view. 
2.2.  Information  on the pharmaceutical  formulation  used in the study 
EP2006 was developed as a biosimilar  medicinal product to the reference product Neupogen (Amgen). 
It is a recombinant methionylated human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; r-metHuG-
CSF, INN: filgrastim) produced by recombinant DNA technology in E. coli bacteria. EP2006 is a 175 
amino acid protein and has a molecular weight of 18‚800 Daltons. 
G-CSF is a lineage specific colony-stimulating factor which is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and 
endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow  and affects 
neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation and selected end-cell functional activation (including 
enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism  associated with respiratory burst‚ 
antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some functions associated with cell surface 
antigens). 
EP2006 has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human 
DNA sequence analysis‚ except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression 
in E. coli. Because EP2006 is produced in E. coli‚ the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from 
G-CSF isolated from a human cell. 
 
Marketing authorization status in the EU, Japan and worldwide 
EP2006 was authorized in the EU in 2009 through the centralized procedure (EMEA/H/C/000917; 
EMEA/H/C/000918). Invented names in the EU are Zarzio and Filgrastim Hexal. It was approved in 
Japan in 2014 as Filgrastim BS Injection 75µg / 150µg / 300µg Syringe. Worldwide, EP2006 is 
approved in 87 countries (status Dec-2020). 
Approved indications in the EU 
EP2006 is approved for the following indications in the EU: 
•  Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients 
treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic 
myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and reduction in the duration of neutropenia in 
patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow  transplantation considered to 
be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. 
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
•  Mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). 
• 
• 
In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, 
long term administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the 
incidence and duration of infection-related events. 
Treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109/l) in patients with advanced HIV infection, 
in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to manage neutropenia are 
inappropriate. 
Approved formulations in the EU 
EP2006 is available in the following formulations in the EU; a specific paediatric formulation is not 
available: 
Filgrastim 30 MU/0.5 mL solution for injection or infusion in pre-filled syringe: 
•  Each ml of solution contains 60 million units (MU) (equivalent to 600 μg) filgrastim. 
•  Each pre-filled syringe contains 30 MU (equivalent to 300 μg) filgrastim in 0.5 mL. 
Filgrastim 48 MU/0.5 mL solution for injection or infusion in pre-filled syringe: 
•  Each ml of solution contains 96 million units (MU) (equivalent to 960 μg) filgrastim. 
•  Each pre-filled syringe contains 48 MU (equivalent to 480 μg) filgrastim in 0.5 mL. 
2.3.  Clinical  aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Clinical  study 
Description 
The drug-use result survey was started in May 2016, and the registration was started on June 17, 
2016. The registration period was extended by 1 year (until May 2018) because it was difficult to 
achieve the target sample size (300 subjects) for the registration period of 2 years, and further by 10 
months (until March 2019) because it was still difficult to achieve the target. Then the target sample 
size was achieved. The collection of the survey forms started in September  2016 and the last forms 
were collected in the period from March 2020 to September  2020. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The survey, CEP2006JP01, was conducted as post-marketing surveillance of the safety of EP2006 in 
line with the Japanese “Guideline for  the Quality, Safety and Efficacy Assurance of Follow-on Biologics” 
(PFSB/ELD Notification No. 0304007). The aim was to collect information on safety and efficacy of 
Filgrastim BS Injection 75 μg/150 μg/300 μg Syringe “Sandoz” in the clinical setting to ensure effective 
and safe use of the product in the following 4 indications: 
I.  Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into peripheral blood (excluding healthy donors*) 
II. 
III. 
IV. 
Promotion of increasing neutrophil count at hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
Neutropenia due to cancer chemotherapy 
Neutropenia interfering with the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 
* For healthy  donors in  the mobilization  of  hematopoietic  stem cells  into  peripheral  blood,  subjects were excluded 
f rom this  survey because they were registered in  the  "Short-term Follow-up  Survey f or related  hematopoietic  stem 
cell  donors in  whom peripheral  blood  stem cells  were mobilized  using  biosimilar  granulocyte  colony-stimulating 
f actor (G-CSF)"  by the Japan Society  f or Hematopoietic  Cell  Transplantation  to conduct  the  survey. 
Study design 
The study was a drug-use results survey. The observational period per subject was until 4 weeks after 
the administration of EP2006 has finished. 
Sample size 
The target numbers of patients was 300 patients. 
Treatments 
In the survey, the Japanese Filgrastim BS Injection 75 μg/150 μg/300 μg Syringe “Sandoz” was used, 
i.e.: 
• 
• 
• 
Filgrastim (75 μg/0.25 mL)  solution for injection or infusion in a pre-filled syringe 
Filgrastim (150 μg/0.5 mL)  solution for injection or infusion in a pre-filled syringe 
Filgrastim (300 μg/0.75 mL) solution for injection or infusion in a pre-filled syringe 
The Japanese package insert states that dosage and administration for children is the same as for 
adults. 
Assessor’s comment: 
In the Zarzio SmPC is also stated that the dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the 
same as those in adults (receiving myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy). 
 
 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety endpoints were adverse events (AEs; including adverse drug reactions, serious adverse events 
[SAEs], and death) and the following priority surveillance items: 
• 
• 
For indication I: drug effect decreased, hypersensitivity reactions (shock, etc.), low back pain, 
headache, arthralgia, and pyrexia; 
For indications II, III,  IV: drug effect decreased, hypersensitivity reactions (shock, etc.), low back 
pain, pyrexia, and bone pain. 
Efficacy endpoints were white blood cell count and neutrophil count including changes from baseline. 
Additionally, the investigator had to judge if the product was effective for a subject or not. 
Results 
Study population 
The final number of subjects registered was 301. Survey forms were collected from all 301 registered 
subjects. The safety analysis population and the efficacy analysis population included 301 subjects 
whose all survey forms were collected, and no subjects were excluded from both the safety analysis 
population and the efficacy analysis population. The number of subjects registered by indication is 
depicted in Figure 1. 
Of the 301 patients, 168 were male and 133 female. The median age was 71 years. 
One paediatric subject at the age of 16 was enrolled in the study (indication III, i.e. neutropenia due to 
cancer chemotherapy) and did not discontinue the treatment. 
The subject received EP2006 for a total of 46 days, with a dose of 150 μg per day. 
Demographic data and other baseline characteristics of this subject are presented in Table 2-1. 
 
 
 
Efficacy results 
The treatment with EP2006 was judged as effective by the investigator for the subject. The values for 
neutrophil and white blood cell count before and after administration of the drug are summarized in 
Table 2-2. 
Safety results 
Overall, 72 ADRs were reported in 26/301 subjects (all for indication III).  The incidence was 8.6% 
(26/301 subjects). The most common SOC was “Investigations” with 27 events (7 of which were 
serious). The most common ADR was “White blood cell count increased”" with 6 events (1 of which 
was serious) and “Platelet count decreased” with 6 events (all serious). No tendency and other 
problems  were observed. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The risk of thrombocytopenia is a listed term in the Zarzio SmPC with frequency very common.  The 
cases of ”White blood cell count increased” are related to the mechanism of action. Other AEs 
reported more than a single time were all known risks, listed in the SmPC: malaise, AST increased 
(n=4), neutrophils increased, constipation (n=3), LDH increased, ALP increased, ALT increased, 
alopecia, inappetence and pharyngodynia (n=2). 
AEs without causal relationship were mostly reported in SOC “Investigations” with 56 events (19 were 
serious). The most common event was “Febrile neutropenia” (38 events). Death was reported in the 
survey form of 32 subjects. There was no causal relationship between the cause of death and this 
 
 
 
 
 
 
product. In the large majority of the cases the cause of death is related to the progression of the 
underlying disease. 
As priority  survey items, drug effect decreased, hypersensitivity reactions (shock, etc.), low back pain, 
headache, arthralgia, and pyrexia were selected for the mobilization effect of hematopoietic stem cells 
into peripheral blood, and drug effect decreased, hypersensitivity reactions, low back pain, pyrexia, 
and bone pain were selected for other indications. The items reported were pyrexia in 8 subjects, 
hypersensitivity reaction (shock, etc.) in 2 subjects, bone pain in 1 subject, and low back pain in 2 
subjects. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The risk of pyrexia, hypersensitivity, low back pain and bone pain are all known risks of the product. 
Altogether, based on the provided review no new safety concern was identified. The reported AEs 
were in line with the known safety profile of the product. 
The paediatric subject experienced 5 AEs of which all were reported as SAEs and 1 event was reported 
as related to EP2006 (Table 2-3). None of these AEs matched the priority  surveillance items defined in 
the protocol. None of the AEs resulted in death. 
Regarding the SAEs that were not reported as related to EP2006, the intestinal obstruction’s cause was 
thought to be concomitant anticancer drugs such as vincristine. The bleeding tendency’s cause was also 
thought  to  be  concomitant  anticancer  drugs  such  as  cytarabine  and  dexamethasone.  The  catheter 
infection's and axillary lymphadenitis' causes are thought to be other reasons (not specified). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH concludes that treatment with EP2006 was effective in the paediatric subject and that the AEs 
experienced by  the  paediatric  subject  were  in  line  with  the  known  safety profile  of  EP2006. Further, 
based  on the  data collected  for  this single paediatric  patient  included in  the study, an  update of  the 
product information is not applicable,  according to the MAH. 
These conclusions of the MAH can be agreed. 
For the single paediatric patient in the study, the filgrastim treatment was indeed effective, even though 
the dose received (150 μg per  day) does not seem  to be  in accordance with  the dose of 5 μg/kg/day 
recommended in the Zarzio SmPC. 
The SAE of thrombocytopenia that was reported as related is a well-known ADR for filgrastim. 
 
 
 
It is also agreed with the MAH that there is no need to update the SmPC. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required (there is no need to update the SmPC).

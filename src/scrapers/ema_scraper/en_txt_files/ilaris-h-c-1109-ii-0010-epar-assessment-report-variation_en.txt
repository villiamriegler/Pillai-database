Scientific advice/Protocol assistance 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 22 October 2009 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/629137/2009), 
20 May 2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/287075/2010) and 23 September 2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/569688/2010). 
The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier. 
1.3.  Introduction 
Canakinumab (Ilaris) is a recombinant human monoclonal anti-human antibody of the IgG1/kappa isotype 
subclass. It binds selectively and with high affinity, to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with no cross-reactivity with 
IL-1α or the IL-1 receptor antagonist. The IL-1β-canakinumab complex cannot bind to the IL-1 receptor, 
rendering the bound IL-1β functionally ineffective. 
Canakinumab (Ilaris) is approved to treat CAPS in over 40 countries and available in more than 10 countries 
(including the US, EU, Switzerland, Canada and Australia) at the dose of 150 mg s.c. given every 8 weeks. 
Gout is a relatively common disorder. Gout is associated with hyperuricemia that may trigger an acute or 
chronic arthritis, typically in the foot, ankle or knee. The arthritis is characterised by synovitis with high 
levels  of  neutrophils  in  the  synovial  fluid.  Cytokines,  including  IL-1ß,  act  as  mediators  of  the  acute 
inflammation  in  the  gouty  arthritis.  The  typical  manifestation  is  an  acute  painful  arthritis  of  the  first 
metatarso-phalangeal  joint.  Other  manifestations  of  gout  are  urate-containing  tophi,  urate-containing 
kidney  stones  and  even  an  urate  nephropathy.  Hyperuricemia  is  often  associated  with  hypertension, 
diabetes, obesity and the use of diuretics. “Metabolic syndrome” is often associated with hyperuricemia and 
gout.  Gouty  arthritis  is  becoming  more  frequent  worldwide.  Prevalence of  gout  in  the  United  States  has 
increased during the previous decades, mostly as a result of dietary factors and population aging.  
Uric acid lowering diet and pharmacotherapy (e.g. allopurinol) compose the standard of care. Approximately 
10-20% of patients with gout are not adequately managed with the standard urate-lowerin  g therapy and 
may have flares of acute arthritis. 
There are significant variations in the pharmacotherapeutic approach to gouty arthritis. NSAIDs are used 
widely to relieve pain and inflammation but may not be effective in the most severe cases. Colchicine is used 
in some regions in spite of its significant toxicity. Local and systemic corticosteroids are frequently used to 
treat most severe cases. The use of corticosteroids is not always desirable due to the metabolic conditions 
that are often associated with gout. There is an unmet medical need for medicinal products to treat acute 
gouty arthritis in patients in whom these therapies are contraindicated, not tolerated, not appropriate, or do 
not provide an adequate response.  
No specific EMA/CHMP guideline is available for the clinical development of products in acute gouty arthritis.

The  MAH  initially  claimed  with  this  submission  the  following  new  indication:  “Ilaris  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of gouty arthritis attacks in adult patients who cannot be adequately treated with standard of care 
anti-inflammatory  medicinal  products  (e.g.  NSAIDd,  colchicine).  Ilaris  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the 
frequency of subsequent attacks”. The MAH also initially recommended a single 150 mg dose treatment and 
an  interval  of  at  least  14  days  before  a  new  dose  for  patients  requiring  re-treatment.  Following  the 
evaluation of the efficacy and safety data supporting this submission, the following restricted indication was 
considered approvable by the CHMP: “Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with 
frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  (at  least  3  attacks  in  the  previous  12  months)  in  whom  non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated., or do not provide 
an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.”. Furthermore, 
the re-treatment period was expanded to an interval of at least 12 weeks between two doses of Ilaris. 
1.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.4.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies were performed to support the use of canakinumab for the treatment of gouty 
arthritis. Non-clinical data relevant for this application are reported below.  
1.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against human IL-1b. It blocks binding of IL-1b to the IL-1 
receptor  and  inhibits  IL-1-induced  reactions.  The  antibody  cross-reacts  only  with  marmoset  IL-1b  was 
demonstrated  by  the  MAH  with  the  initial  MAA.  Here,  reference  is  made  to  one  new  study,  study 
RD-2009-00108  which  confirms  that  canakinumab  has  biological  activity  towards  natural  (in  addition  to 
recombinant) marmoset IL-1b in a cellular assay. The data confirm that marmoset is a relevant species for 
canakinumab. 
The rationale for neutralizing IL-1b in gout is provided below. 
On a cellular level, gouty attacks are characterized by infiltration and activation of neutrophils into the joint 
cavity. It has long been known that monosodium urate (MSU) crystals cause neutrophil influx and activation 
(Phelps,  1966)  and  induce  production  of  IL-1b  by  blood  monocytes  and  synovial  mononuclear  cells  (di 
Giovine  et  al.,  1987).  More  recently,  it  was  shown  that  MSU  crystals  activate  the  NALP3  inflammasome 
which leads to secretion of IL-1b (Martinon et al., 2006). Genetic ablation of IL-1 signalling or neutralisation 
of  IL-1  in  animal  models  of  MSU  crystal-induced  inflammation  inhibited  neutrophil  migration  and  joint 
inflammation  (Chen  et  al.,  2006;  Torres  et  al.,  2009).  Taken  together,  these  data  reveal  a  sequence  of 
cellular events which establish a pivotal role of IL-1 in inflammation induced by urate crystals. The final proof 
of concept for the pathophysiology of gout came from the clinical application of recombinant IL-1 receptor 
antagonist (anakinra) in gout patients which led to a rapid relief of symptoms (So et al., 2007). 
1.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  comparison  of  PK  parameters  in  marmoset  monkey,  rhesus  monkey,  healthy  volunteers  and  in  gout 
patients was provided by the MAH (see table 1 below). In addition, systemic exposure ratios in marmosets 
and human gout patients were compared (see table 2 below).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 7/136 
 
 
  
 
Monkey PK data were already provided by the MAH with the initial MAA submission. The human PK and total 
IL-1b  data  are  described  in  the  population-based  PK-binding  model.  Canakinumab  concentration-time 
profiles were simulated for a typical gout patient weighing 93 kg, based on a dosing regimen of 150 mg every 
12 weeks for 1 year.   
Table 1.  Comparative pharmacokinetics (Mean (SD)) of ACZ885 
Clearance of canakinumab in marmosets is higher because of the lower affinity of human IgG1 to marmoset 
FcRn than for human FcRn (Boon, 2001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 8/136 
 
 
 
  
 
Table 2.  Comparative systemic exposure in marmosets and humans (Gout patients) 
The  studies  in  marmoset  performed  so  far,  provide  a  sufficiently  high  exposure  multiple  to  support  the 
proposed treatment in gout patients.  
1.4.4.  Toxicology 
The MAH submitted an updated assessment of the carcinogenic potential of canakinumab outlining in detail 
the carcinogenicity strategy for canakinumab.  
A discussion on literature data on the role of IL-1β in tumour biology was provided by the MAH. Overall, the 
weight  of  evidence  from  the  scientific  literature  suggests  that  IL-1β  has  a  more  likely  role  in  tumour 
promotion rather than in anti-tumour immunity. Thus, anti-IL-1β treatment is not expected to results in an 
increased tumour growth promotion or occurrence. Based on the existing toxicity data, canakinumab had no 
effect  on  the  measured  immune  function  parameters  and  did  not  promote  the  occurrence  of 
lymphoproliferative disease at dose levels of up to 150 mg/kg in the chronic marmoset toxicity study.  
Conventional carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary for the following reasons: 1) the IgG1 
chemical structures itself does not represent a carcinogenic risk; 2) canakinumab is not pharmacologically 
active  in  rodents;  3)  carcinogenicity  studies  are  not  pragmatically  or  ethically  feasible  in  marmoset 
monkeys;  4)  based  on  the  weight  of  evidence  in  the  literature  available  to  date  in  pre-clinical  models, 
neutralizing IL-1β does not suggest an increased tumour promoting risk; 5) carcinogenicity studies with a 
surrogate anti-murine IL-1β mAb would not contribute meaningfully beyond the information summarized 
above.  The  carcinogenic  risk  of  canakinumab  is  addressed  through  the  pharmacovigilance  system 
(malignancies is included as an important potential risk in the RMP). 
1.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the "Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use" (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk in 
the environment. Thus, the absence of an environmental risk assessment is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 9/136 
 
 
 
  
 
1.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies were performed to support this variation application as the non-clinical data 
reviewed in the context of the canakinumab initial MAA is applicable for the present application this was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Regarding the pharmacodynamics, the MAH has delineated the rationale for using canakinumab in gouty 
arthritis based on literature data. The CHMP considers that the available literature support the concept of 
blocking IL-1 signalling in order to treat the inflammatory reaction in gout patients. Additional non-clinical 
studies  with  canakinumab  in  marmosets  or  the  surrogate  antibody  01BSUR  in  mice  in  a  model  of 
monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation are not expected to provide additional information. Thus, 
the lack of such studies is acceptable.  
Regarding pharmacokinetics, the studies in marmoset performed so far, provide a sufficiently high exposure 
multiple to support the proposed treatment in gout patients.  
Potential concerns regarding long-term blockade of IL-1β are a reduced host-immune defence and tumour 
surveillance.  Thus  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  carcinogenicity  risk  associated  with  canakinumab  was 
provided. Based on this assessment, it is agreed that conventional carcinogenicity studies are not required 
and  that  the  potential  risk  of  malignancies  is  adequately  addressed  in  the  RMP  through  routine 
pharmacovigilance, targeted questionnaire and data collection in a registry. 
1.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicity data which were evaluated during the MAA of 
canakinumab  are  considered  appropriate  to  support  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication  to  the 
symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks when other treatment alternatives 
have failed, are contraindicated or not tolerated.  
1.5.  Clinical aspects 
1.5.1.  Introduction 
This  application  is  supported  by  a  dose  ranging,  efficacy  and  safety  phase  II  study  (study  H2225) 
investigating 5 doses of canakinumab in gouty arthritis and two pivotal 12 week, randomized, double-blind 
active controlled phase III studies (studies H2356 and H2357 of similar design)and their 24 weeks extension 
phase. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
During the evaluation the MAH informed the EMA and the CHMP about errors in the CSR for studies H2356 
and H2357 and their respective extension phase submitted to support this extension of indication which led 
to  CSR  amendments/addenda.  According  to  the  MAH,  these  amendments  became  necessary  after  the 
central laboratory informed the MAH that some of their regional laboratories had used wrong reference or 
alert range for selected lab parameters which were part of the safety assessment of these studies. Based on 
this  information,  the  CHMP  requested  an  updated/corrected  dossier  reflecting  the  errors  identified  and 
asking  the  MAH  to  submit  a  root  cause  analysis  and  CAPA  plan  for  this  issue.  The  MAH  provided  the 
requested data/information which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Table 3.  Tabular overview of clinical studies  
1.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted 12 clinical studies with PK and PD assessments, which examined doses up to 600 mg iv 
(n=10)  in  healthy  subjects  (A2207),  in  RA  patients  (A2204,  A2206,  A2207,  A2211,  A2201,  2201E1),  in 
gouty arthritis patients (A2212, H2356, H2251, H2251E1, H2255), and in CAPS patients (D2306). Studies 
H2251, H2255, H2356, and H2357 included over 1085 gouty arthritis patients treated for acute flare and 
received study drug, 691 patients receiving canakinumab.

Page 11/136 
 
 
 
  
 
Table 4.  Overview of Study Design of Individual Clinical Studies 
In studies with gouty arthritis, canakinumab was given as s.c injection (doses ranging from 10 mg to 300 
mg) except in one study (10 mg/kg i.v. infusion) which was discontinued. Only in study H2356 product D 
was used which is the final commercial product of canakinumab in the proposed gout indication, whereas in 
other PK trials in gout and all in RA or CAPS earlier formulations (A-C) were used. 
Analytical Methods  
The  competitive  ELISA  based  method  for  canakinumab  determination  and  the  sandwich-ELISA  for  IL-1β 
determination in serum samples were identical to those applied during the studies presented with the initial 
MAA  submission  in  CAPS  but  they  were  successfully  transferred  to  another  analytical  laboratory,  SGS 
Cephac  Europe.  Acceptable  methods  cross  validations  have  been  performed  by  analysing  human  serum 
samples previously analysed by the laboratory Novartis Pharma AG. The study of the interference of IL-1β 
with ELISA assay of canakinumab confirmed that it is capable of determining free canakinumab only.  
PK results in gouty arthritis patients 
Results from individual studies 
In all individual study summaries, the reported PK/PD parameters defined in the table below are from the 
PK-binding model that analyzed pooled data from 1298 subjects.

Table 5.  PK and binding parameters determined by compartmental analysis 
Study  H2356 was an active controlled randomized double-blind Phase  III trial in comorbid patients with 
gouty arthritis form whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine are contradicted, not tolerated or ineffective, designed 
to  establish  two  co-primary  endpoints  which  are  1)  demonstrating  that  canakinumab  is  superior  to 
triamcinolone acetonide with respect to patient’s visual analog assessment (VAS 0-100mm) of gout pain 
intensity  in  the  target  joint  at  72-hours  post-dose  and  2)  to  confirm  that  canakinumab  is  superior  to 
triamcinolone acetonide with respect to the time to the first new gout flare. Secondary endpoints included 
evaluation  of  the  efficacy  of  canakinumab  compared  to  triamcinolone  acetonide  with  respect  to  the 
treatment of signs and symptoms of each acute gout flare as well as evaluation of the PK/PD of canakinumab 
in these patients. 228 patients were randomly assigned to receive either one s.c. injection of canakinumab 
150 mg or one i.m. injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg.  
Patients were given on-demand doses of the randomly selected study drugs while maintaining at least a 2 
week  interval  between  doses.  Serum  canakinumab  levels  were  evaluated  in  113  patients  receiving 
canakinumab at the following post-dose time points: Day 1 (predose), 2, 4, 8, 57, 85. Additional PK samples 
were collected on Days 1, 3, 7 of unscheduled new flare visits. 
From the study report it is obvious that the majority of the patients received only one dose of study drug 
(79.4%  overall).  A  total  of  20  patients  in  the  canakinumab  group  and  27  patients  in  the  triamcinolone 
acetonide group required a second or third dose of study medication. 
The majority of patients took concomitant medications that started before or after the start of study drug 
(89.4% in the canakinumab group and 94.8% in the triamcinolone acetonide group). The most common 
classes of concomitant medications (i.e., ≥20.0% of patients overall) were preparations inhibiting uric acid 
production (54.8%; mainly allopurinol), ACE inhibitors32.5%), selective beta-blocking agents (28.9%), and 
angiotensin II antagonists (21.1%). Allopurinol was the medication taken most often (54.4%) followed by 
paracetamol (12.7%), amlodipine (10.5%), and acetylsalicylic acid (9.6%). 
The concentration-time profiles of canakinumab in 16 individual patients were extracted from the full study 
report as representative examples:

analyzed using the PK-binding model. The model successfully fitted the concentration data for canakinumab 
and total IL-1ß.The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. The 
mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of  canakinumab  was  0.232  L/d  with  a  mean  volume  of  distribution  (Vss= 
VD+VP) of 8.04 L. The absorption rate constant from the subcutaneous injection site was estimated to be 
0.278 day-1. Absolute bioavailability (F) was estimated to be 59.5 %.

Study H2255 was an 8  week Phase II active-controlled study with a primary  objective to determine the 
target dose of canakinumab in the treatment of acute flares in gouty arthritis patients who are refractory or 
contraindicated to NSAIDS and/or colchicine. The target dose was defined as the dose that leads to the same 
efficacy as the comparator and was to be identified by assessing the dose response relationship of various 
doses  of  canakinumab  with  regards  to  the  pain  intensity  (VAS)  in  the  target  joint  at  72  hours  (Day  4) 
post-dose. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of PK/PD in patients with acute gout flare and also evaluation of 
the change in pain intensity (VAS) in the target joint following canakinumab administration compared to 
triamcinolone  acetonide  at  various  post-dose  timepoints.  Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  single 
canakinumab doses as either 10, 25, 50, 90 or 150 mg subcutaneously (N=28, 29, 29, 29,28) or to receive 
triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg intramuscularly. Serum Canakinumab was evaluated in patients at post-dose 
time points Days 1 (predose), 4, 8, 29, 57.

patients  in  study  [CACZ885H2255]  by  dose  group  following  single  dose 
canakinumab treatment 
The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized by dose group in the table below. The 
mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of  canakinumab  ranged  from  0.188-0.314  L/d  with  a  mean  volume  of 
distribution  (Vss)  of  6.91-10.1  L.  The  estimated  mean  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  for  binding  of 
canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) ranged from 0.986-1.16 nM. Absolute bioavailability F was estimated to be 69.4 
% for all dose groups. 
Efficacy  assessments  showed  a  statistically  significantly  better  response  with  the  highest  dose  of 
canakinumab (150 mg) than with triamcinolone acetonide.

Study  A2212  was  a  Phase  II  study  to  assess  the  effect  of  a  single  intravenous  dose  of  canakinumab  in 
hospitalized patients with gouty arthritis and an acute flare. Secondary objectives included demonstration of 
non-inferiority  for  a  single  dose  of  10mg/kg  canakinumab  compared  to  the  active  comparator, 
dexamethasone and also evaluation of the PK/PD of canakinumab. Patients were randomized to receive one 
of the following two treatments on Day 1 of the study: 10 mg/kg canakinumab as an i.v. infusion over 2 
hours  plus  a  placebo  control  or  12  mg  dexamethasone  as  an  i.v.  infusion  over  30  min  plus  a  matching 
placebo for canakinumab. 
Due to enrollment challenges the study was terminated after 6 patients had been enrolled (target was 44 
patients). Three subjects completed the study in each of the dose groups resulting in a total study size of 6 
patients. Serum canakinumab, total IL-1β and the primary gout flare pain efficacy measures (assessed on a 
Likert scale) were evaluated in patients at various post-dose time points to characterize the PK and PD of 
canakinumab. 
The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. For the two subjects 
whose  profile  was  satisfactorily  described  by  the  PK-binding  model  (5104  and  5105),  the  canakinumab 
serum clearance (CL) estimates were 0.163 and 0.224 L/day with total volume of distribution (Vss) of 5.83 
and 9.56 L. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β were 1.20 and 
1.31 nM.

Study  H2251  was  a  Phase  II  24-week  active-controlled  double-blind  study  with  a  primary  objective  to 
determine the target dose of canakinumab in the treatment of acute flares in gouty arthritis patients who are 
initiating allopurinol therapy. The target dose of canakinumab was defined as the minimum single dose that 
leads to at least the same efficacy as the comparator colchicine over the 16-week efficacy period. Secondary 
objectives included comparison of single versus repeated dose canakinumab efficacy with regards to the 
mean number of gout flares up to 16 weeks after randomization and also evaluation of canakinumab PK/PD 
in patients up to 24 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive either canakinumab 25, 50, 100, 200, or 
300 mg s.c. on Day 1; or 50 mg s.c. at Days 1 and 29 followed by 25 mg s.c. on Days 57 and 85; or received 
the comparator 0.5 mg colchicine capsule orally once daily throughout the 16 week treatment period. Serum 
canakinumab was evaluated in patients at the post-dose time points week 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25.  
The dose-response analysis indicated that all canakinumab treatment arms were numerically better than 
colchicine in reducing the mean number of gout flares over 16 and 24 weeks. Canakinumab was efficacious 
in  preventing  the  onset  of  gout  flares  in  gouty  arthritis  patients  initiating  urate  lowering  therapy 
(allopurinol).  
The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized by dose group in the table below. The 
mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of  canakinumab  ranged  from  0.209-0.262  L/d  with  a  mean  volume  of 
distribution  (Vss)  of  7.22-8.56  L.  The  estimated  mean  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  for  binding  of 
canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) ranged from 0.959-1.2 nM.

The study extension 5H2251E1 aimed to provide additional long-term safety and tolerability data up to a 
total of 12 months for patients rolling over from the core study H2251 and to investigate the on-demand use 
of canakinumab for the treatment of newly occurring acute flares during the extension study. Secondary 
objectives included ongoing assessment of efficacy and PK/PD. Four groups of patients were selected for this 
extension. Group A patients received canakinumab in the core study and were treated with canakinumab in 
the extension study. Group B patients received canakinumab in the core study and did not receive treatment 
with canakinumab in the extension study. Group C patients received colchicine in the core study and were 
treated with canakinumab in the extension study. Group D patients received colchicine in the core study and 
did not receive treatment with canakinumab in the extension study.  
The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. The mean serum 
clearance (CL) of canakinumab was 0.232 L/d with a mean volume of distribution (Vss) of 7.65 L. The 
estimated mean quilibrium dissociation constant for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) was 1.08 nM. 
These values agreed with those in the core study.

Studies A2201, A2201E1, A2201E2 were done in Rheumatoid arthritis patients using three different dosing 
regimen.  During  the  extension  studies  E1  and  E2  some  patients  were  switched  from  300  mg  s.c.  2-  or 
4-weekly to 150 mg s.c. 2 or 4-weekly. 
The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below. The mean serum

The secondary objectives included characterization of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) of canakinumab. The total treatment duration was 6 months to 2 years with various dose amounts, 
titrations  and  dosing  intervals.  New  patients  and  most  patients  continuing  over  from  A2102  or  D2304 
received  canakinumab  administered  as  an  injection  subcutaneously  (s.c.)  every  8  weeks.  Serum 
canakinumab,  total  IL-1β  and  the  primary  gout  flare  pain  efficacy  measures  (VAS)  were  evaluated  in 
patients at various postdose time points to characterize the PK and PD of canakinumab. 
The PK characteristics of canakinumab in this study are summarized in the table below by patient subgroup 
(adults,  pediatric  patients  >  40  kg,  pediatric  patients  ≤  40  kg).  The  mean  serum  clearance  (CL)  of 
canakinumab in adults was 0.169 L/d with a mean volume of distribution (Vss) of 6.04 L. The estimated 
mean equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) was 1.72 nM.

Population PK results 
A combined PK-binding model was used to analyze pooled data from 1298 subjects. 
The PK parameters of canakinumab were determined from a compartmental modeling approach (described 
by a population-based PK-binding model). The model is a dynamic drugligand binding and turnover model 
developed based on the schematic: 
canakinumab + IL-1β ↔ canakinumab-IL-1β complex 
This model integrates both canakinumab and IL-1β inputs and elimination (turnover), and binding affinity 
(Kd) of canakinumab to IL-1β. A population analysis was conducted on combined PK (canakinumab) and PD 
(total IL-1β) serum concentration data from the previous CAPS submission database plus the data from the 
current trials included in this dossier. The table below summarizes the PK parameter estimates in a “typical” 
gouty arthritis patient. The term “typical” is used to describe a patient with the median or default values for 
the significant covariates: 93 kg body weight (the median body weight of gout subjects), and 34 years old 
with 43 g/L of serum albumin. The default values of age and albumin were medians carried forward from the 
previous model, and may not reflect the slightly older gout population; however, since age does not impact 
the primary PK parameters (clearance and volume), no adjustment of this value was made in the model. The 
SEM is the standard error of the population mean and the %CV is the intersubject variability estimate.

Table 13.  PK-binding model parameter estimates of canakinumab for a “typical” gouty arthritis 
patients 
The key PK properties of canakinumab relevant to this submission were summarized by the applicant as 
follows (the estimates from the PK-binding model are presented as mean ± SEM): 
Following subcutaneous administration of canakinumab (Product Type D) in adult gouty arthritis patients, 
canakinumab  was  absorbed  with  a  rate  constant  (ka)  of  0.319  ±  0.0285  d-1.  The  estimated  absolute 
bioavailability (F) was 59.5 ± 3.74%. 
The  estimated  serum  clearance  of  canakinumab  was  0.229  ±  0.00716  L/day  in  a  typical  gouty  arthritis 
patient,  consistent  with  the  clearance  values  for  human  IgG  molecules.  The  corresponding  volume  of 
distribution at steady state was 7.76 L, which is slightly greater than the serum volume and characteristic for 
the distribution of large macromolecules. 
The half-life (t1/2) of canakinumab in adult gouty arthritis patients was 25.6 days. 
Following  repeated  administration  of  150  mg  s.c.  every  12  weeks  in  adult  gouty  arthritis  patients,  the 
expected accumulation ratio of canakinumab was 1.1-fold. 
For the same regimen and patient, the estimated steady state Cmax and  AUCtau were 11.3 μg/mL and 
383.8 μg·day/mL, respectively 
Canakinumab displayed dose independent PK properties, with clearance remaining unchanged within the 
dose range studied (i.e. 10 mg to 300 mg s.c.) in gouty arthritis patients. There was no indication of changes 
in pharmacokinetic properties over time as supported by the PK-binding model. 
Serum clearance of canakinumab and its volumes of distribution were dependent on body weight (in an 
allometric relationship with a power of approximately 0.5-1) 
PK parameters were comparable between  various  patient populations  and  healthy subjects.  No  clinically 
significant differences in canakinumab PK were observed between CAPS and gouty arthritis patients. 
No  clinically  significant  changes  in  canakinumab  PK  were  observed  due  to  differences  in  gender  (after 
correction for body weight). 
There were no differences in pharmacokinetics of canakinumab between elderly versus non-elderly adult 
patients with regard to clearance and volume of distribution. 
Various covariates (body weight, age, sex, ethnicity, laboratory values, study population, and product type 
changes),  were  explored  graphically  and  statistically  in  the  previous  PK-binding  modeling  exercise  to 
determine those characteristics that affect canakinumab PK or its binding affinity to IL-1β. For the current 
submission, creatinine clearance and body mass index (BMI) were also considered as potential covariates as 
obesity and renal impairment are common co-morbidities in gouty arthritis patients.

Subpopulations 
PK parameters were comparable between various patient populations and healthy subjects, and clearance 
estimates ranged from 0.148 to 0.214 L/day normalized for a 70kg adult. The population estimate of serum 
clearance of canakinumab in various patient populations is presented in the table below; all were normalized 
to the weight of 70 kg, for comparison purposes. 
Table 14.  PK-binding model estimated serum clearance in different patient populations 
Gender 
No gender-related difference was observed in any of the PK parameters of canakinumab after correction for 
body weight. PK and PD data from 777 males and 521 females were included in the PK-binding database. 
Ethnic origin 
The PK of canakinumab has been studied in several ethnic groups. The PK parameters are not influenced by 
ethnicity.  Although  much  of  the  race/ethnic  information  was  missing  or  unknown,  the  database  in  the 
PK-binding  model  included  at  least  1106  Caucasians,  84  Asians  (37  were  Japanese,  25  Chinese,  and  5 
Indian), 28 black, and 12 Native Americans/Pacific Islanders; 115 subjects were of Hispanic or Latin origin. 
As reported previously, after adjustment for body weight in the model, non-Japanese and Japanese healthy 
volunteers differed in canakinumab clearance only by about 17%, with the non-Japanese subjects having 
the slower clearance. 
Age 
Based on the PK-binding model, age (range 3-91 years) did not impact the key PK parameters (clearance, 
volumes of distribution) of canakinumab after correction for body weight.  In the phase III trials of gout 
indication, no pediatric subjects were enrolled, thus, no PK information in this patient population is available. 
Body weight 
For the CAPS population it has been shown that CL and V increase with body weight. This lead to the dosing 
regimen using 150 mg s.c. flat dose for adults and a BW-adjusted dose for children < 40 kg (2 mg/kg). 
Based on the PK-binding model, the clearance and volumes of canakinumab were shown to correlate with 
bodyweight  in  an  allometric  relationship  with  a  power  of  approximately  0.5-1.  Over  the  range  of  body 
weights observed in the gout population (52.0 to 145.5 kg) the clearance would change from 0.141 to 0.332 
L/d (keeping all other covariates constant). 
Since a higher BMI is common in gouty arthritis patients, the relationships between body mass index (BMI) 
and PK parameters were also explored. The results indicated that PK of canakinumab is not BMI-dependent, 
after body weight is taken into account.

Impaired renal function 
As reported in the CAPS dossier, the apparent clearance values (CL/F) of four patients with moderate to 
end-stage renal insufficiency in the study A2102 ranged from 0.196 to 0.246 L/day after a 150 mg s.c. dose. 
These values are similar to the mean adult CL/F value of 0.228 L/day, suggesting lack of any significant 
effect  of  renal  impairment  on  canakinumab  PK.As  renal  impairment  is  a  common  co-morbidity  in  gouty 
arthritis patients, creatinine clearance (CrCL) was explored as a potential factor influencing canakinumab 
PK. The graphical exploration of creatinine clearance against the normalized random effects for clearance 
(the difference between an individual’s value and the typical value) showed that creatinine clearance did not 
have  any  noticeable  effect  on  the  clearance  of  canakinumab.  However,  based  on  the  PK-binding  model, 
small, but statistically significant changes in canakinumab clearance in gouty arthritis patients due to renal 
impairment were observed. The mean of the individual estimates of serum clearance in gout patients with 
normal renal function (CrCL > 80 mL/min), mild (CrCL =50 to 80 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment 
(CrCL 30–<50 mL/min) were 0.249, 0.208 and 0.194 L/day respectively (see table below). The clearance 
values in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment are less than 25% of the mean clearance in 
patients with normal renal function (16% and 22% respectively). Considering the estimated inter-subject 
variability  in  clearance  of  36%  across  the  entire  population  of  subjects  in  which  canakinumab  was 
investigated,  this  difference  is  not  clinically  relevant.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  for 
patients with renal impairment. 
Table 15.  Serum clearance of canakinumab for gouty arthritis patients by baseline CrCl 
category 
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal study has been performed with canakinumab in patients with impaired hepatic function as it is 
known  that  the  majority  of  IgG  elimination  occurs  via  intracellular  catabolism,  following  fluid-phase  or 
receptor mediated endocytosis. 
Bioavailability 
Absolute bioavailability was estimated by population PK modelling for the different product types over all 
populations studied in the different PK studies. The estimated absolute bioavailability of canakinumab (mean 
± SEM) after s.c. administration for Product Types A, B, C, D were 60.9 ± 3.74, 64.8 ± 4.14, 69.4 ± 4.39, 
and 59.5 ± 3.74%, respectively.  
A population-specific estimation of bioavailability has not been done and is not possible due to the limited iv 
data in the target population. 
The  overall  estimated  s.c.  bioavailability  of  canakinumab  of  approximately  60  –  70%  is  in  line  with  the 
bioavailability estimates of other IgG monoclonal antibodies.

Dose-proportionality 
Canakinumab  exhibits  dose  proportional  exposure  in  gouty  arthritis  patients,  consistent  with  the  dose 
proportionality demonstrated in the CAPS submission. Dose independence of canakinumab clearance was 
demonstrated by graphical analysis, shown below (see figure below), plotting the individual estimates of 
clearance from the PK-binding model against the administered dose. The slope of CL versus dose based on 
a linear regression fit is approximately zero. As a consequence, it can be concluded that AUC is proportional 
to dose. 
Figure 3.  Canakinumab clearance versus dose from studies in gouty arthritis patients 
Time - invariant PK 
The MAH stated that the following observations support the time invariant PK properties of canakinumab in 
gouty arthritis patients, which are in line with the results reported in the original CAPS submission: 
1. Antibodies to canakinumab were rarely detected in clinical samples collected over the duration of the 
treatment. For each of the five trials in gouty arthritis patients described in this dossier, only 8 of the patients 
treated  with  canakinumab  showed  a  positive  immunogenicity  response  that  was  treatment-related.  The 
presence of anti-canakinumab antibodies had no impact on the PK properties of canakinumab. 
2.  There  was  no  indication  of  changes  in  pharmacokinetic  properties  over  time  as  supported  by  the 
PK-binding model. 
Multiple dose and steady state PK 
The  MAH  stated  that  long  term  (ranging  from  6  months  to  4  years)  PK  and  PD  assessments  have  been 
performed in CAPS and gout trials, with repeat dosing. Based on the PK-binding model, the time to steady 
state  was  approximately  130  days  (i.e.  5  half-lives).  The  accumulation  ratio  was  estimated  to  be 
approximately 1.1-fold for 150 mg dosing every 12 weeks in a 93 kg gouty arthritis patient. For the same 
regimen and patient, the estimated steady state Cmax and AUCtau were 11.3 μg/mL and 384 μg·day/mL, 
respectively.

Drug-drug interactions 
Considering  the  biological  and  macromolecular  nature  of  canakinumab,  no  in  vitro  metabolism/drug 
interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  It  is  known  that  the  majority  of  IgG  elimination  occurs  via 
intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor mediated endocytosis. No specific in-vivo clinical 
drug interaction studies have been performed between canakinumab and other medicinal products.  
The  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  in  gouty  arthritis  patients  are  allopurinol,  paracetamol, 
amlodipine and acetylsalicylic acid (in study H2356). These co-medications are not expected to influence the 
PK of canakinumab. This is mainly because the elimination (metabolic) pathways of monoclonal antibodies 
and  small  molecules  are  different.  Macromolecules  such  as  canakinumab  are  primarily  eliminated  via 
intracellular catabolism and not expected to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. The effect of 
canakinumab on the pharmacokinetics of co-medications is also less likely, even though there is some early 
research  indicating  inflammatory  disease  states  may  influence  the  synthesis  and  expression  of  CYP 
enzymes.  It  was  reported  that  the  synthesis  of  CYP450  enzymes  is  suppressed  by  increased  levels  of 
cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) during chronic inflammation (Aitken 2007, Sunman 2004, Chaluvadi 
2009).  Anti-cytokine  antibodies  such  as  canakinumab  that  target  and  neutralize  these  proinflammatory 
cytokines or their receptors are capable of restoration of CYP450 enzymes to normal levels (Ashino 2007).  
Therefore, there is a possibility of drug interactions with a biologic that reverses an inflammatory condition, 
thus upregulating levels of CYP450s to normal levels and resulting in increased clearance of co-administered 
drug  that  are  CYP450  substrates.  The  product  information  of  canakinumab  for  CAPs  patients  (Ilaris) 
mentions about the potential pathways of interaction affecting the exposure of concomitant medications by 
canakinumab. 
1.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction 
Canakinumab is intended to bind to and thereby inactivate the free IL-1β in the plasma or tissue fluids, so 
that there is lack of free IL-1β available to stimulate the IL-1β type I receptor responsible for the various 
inflammatory responses such as high acute phase serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A 
(SAA)  in  gouty  arthritis  patients.  Thus,  PD  measurements  consisted  of  assaying  total  IL-1β,  and  other 
soluble biomarkers such as CRP and SAA. 
Following  canakinumab  dosing,  the  in  vivo  binding  of  canakinumab  to  endogenous  IL-1βblocks  the 
interaction  of  this  cytokine  to  its  receptors,  thus  functionally  neutralizing  its  bioactivity.  The 
canakinumab-IL-1β complex is eliminated at a much slower rate than the free IL-1β, resulting in elevation 
of total IL-1β. Therefore, increase in total IL-1β is a biomarker for the capture of IL-1β by the antibody. An 
increase  in  total  IL-1β  was  observed  in  all  patient  populations  (healthy  subjects,  CAPS,  RA,  asthma, 
psoriasis) following canakinumab dosing. 
The ability of canakinumab to bind to IL-1β is quantified by the apparent in vivo dissociation constant, Kd, 
estimated at 1.1 ± 0.2 nM in CAPS patients.  
Canakinumab treatment was associated with a decrease of IL-1β-induced downstream mediators including 
IL-1β  itself,  IL-1β  pathway  related  genes,  and  acute  phase  proteins  such  as  serum  amyloid  (SAA)  and 
C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  signifying  that  canakinumab  neutralizes  the  activity  and  down-regulates  the 
production of IL-1β in vivo.

Methods 
Determination of total IL-1ß in serum 
The  total  IL-1  beta  determination  was  performed  using  a  commercial  kit  provided  by  R&D  Systems 
(Quantikine® HS kit, catalog number: HSLB00C, Human IL-1 beta / IL-1F2 Immunoassay). The assay was 
implemented  at  SGS  Cephac  Europe  and  cross-validated  by  analyzing  samples  provided  and  previously 
analyzed by Novartis Pharma AG. 
This  assay  employs  the  quantitative  sandwich  enzyme  immunoassay  technique.  A  monoclonal  antibody 
specific for IL-1 beta has been pre-coated onto a microplate. Standards and samples are pipetted into the 
wells and any IL-1 beta present is bound by the immobilized antibody. After washing away any unbound 
substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for IL-1 beta is added to the wells. Following a 
wash to remove any unbound antibody-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution is added to the wells. After an 
incubation period, an amplifier solution is added to the wells and color develops in proportion to the amount 
of IL-1 beta bound in the initial step. 
The reaction is stopped by addition of sulfuric acid. 
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) amounts to 0.500 pg/mL serum, the upper limit of quantification 
(ULOQ) to 8.00 pg/mL serum.  
PD results in gouty arthritis patients 
Total IL-1ß in serum 
After canakinumab dosing, in vivo binding of canakinumab to IL-1β is confirmed in all gouty arthritis patient 
trials based on the increase in total IL-1β, similar to the results observed in other populations (CAPS, RA, 
psoriasis, asthma, healthy subjects). The increase in total IL-1β was observed for all the drug forms used 
including  the  current  market  form  (Product  Type  D).  The  binding  parameters  were  estimated  by  the 
PK-binding model and reported below as mean ±SEM. The clearance of IL-1β was calculated to be 10.9 ± 
0.986 L/day in gouty arthritis patients, with a terminal half-life of 3.7 days. Endogenous IL-1β production 
rate estimated by the PK-binding model varied with study population; the value was 7.69 ± 0.628 ng/day in 
gouty  arthritis  patients,  and  about  33%  higher  in  CAPS.  The  ability  of  canakinumab  to  bind  to  IL-1β  is 
captured by the apparent in vivo dissociation constant, Kd, with a population estimate of 1.07 ± 0.0742 nM 
in gouty arthritis patients.  
The  concentration  time  profiles  of  total  IL-1β  following  canakinumab  dosing  from  study  H2255  are 
representative of the profiles in other gouty arthritis patients, and are shown in the figure below.

canakinumab treatment 
In study H2356 (see above under PK results) samples for determination of IL-1ß were collected from 113 
patients receiving canakinumab at the same time points as for the PK measurements: Day 1 (predose), 2, 
4, 8, 57, 85. Additional PK and PD samples were collected on Days 1, 3, 7 of unscheduled new flare visits.The 
estimated mean equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of canakinumab to IL-1β (Kd) was 1.05 nM.  
Total  IL-1β  concentrations  increased  following  canakinumab  dosing.  The  mean  equilibrium  dissociation 
constant  for  binding  of  canakinumab  to  IL-1β  (KD)  was  1.05  nM,  signifying  potent  in-vivo  binding  of 
canakinumab to IL-1β. The mean estimated production rate (RLI) and the clearance (CLL) of free IL-1β were 
12.1 ng/d and 13.8 L/day, respectively. 
Individual concentration-time profiles of IL-1ß in 16 patients were extracted from the full study report as

Biomarkers of inflammation 
In contrast to the studies in CAPS patients, across the RA and gout programs, the biomarker that has been 
systematically studied is C-reactive protein (CRP). In gout, serum amyloid A protein (SAA) has also been 
evaluated. 
hsCRP and SAA results  
In this program, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein have been evaluated in 
serum  (for  example,  8  times  between  baseline  and  week  25)  in  order  to  identify  the  presence  of 
inflammation, to determine its severity, and to monitor response to treatment. 
In general, in patients exposed to canakinumab, median C-reactive protein levels dropped initially in all 
treatment groups and then appeared to increase over the following weeks when the treatment was stopped, 
or remain lower compared to baseline levels when patient were redosed.  
A similar pattern was observed with serum amyloid A (SAA) protein levels that dropped initially and then 
started to increase after Day 85. For example, in study CACZ885H2251, canakinumab 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 
mg, 300 mg and repeated dose groups had numerically lower serum amyloid A protein levels over 16 weeks, 
compared to the colchicine group.  
The CRP concentration profiles in all treatment regimens (canakinumab at different doses and colchicine) 
from study CACZ885H2251 are shown in the figure below.

C-reactive protein level (mg/L) by treatment group (Full analysis set) 
In study H2255, the recruited population included patients with acute gout flares, and the levels of amyloid 
A and C-reactive protein were markedly elevated at baseline in all treatment groups. As observed with study 
H2251,  the  levels  dropped  for  all  treatment  groups  during  the  study.  The  figure  below  shows  the  CRP 
decrease over the study duration.

In the small, gout study with 3 hospitalized gouty arthritis patients (study A2212), CRP showed a similar 
decrease. 
Overall, results for the 2 phase II studies were consistent in these gouty arthritis patients and suggest that 
canakinumab normalizes laboratory signs of inflammation such as high CRP and SAA levels. As for the 2 
randomized, pivotal studies against the active comparator (triamcinolone), the trend was similar. In Study 
H2356, hsCRP levels were 36% lower and SAA levels 60% lower at 72 hours post-dose with canakinumab 
relative to triamcinolone (both, p<0.001) while in study CACZ885H2357, hsCRP levels were 40% lower at 72 
h post-dose and 47% lower at 7 days post-dose with canakinumab versus triamcinolone (both, p<0.0001).  
For SAA protein, levels were 27% lower at 24 hours postdose (p=0.0119), 60% lower at 72 hours post-dose 
(p<0.0001) and 61% lower at 7 days postdose (p<0.0001) with canakinumab versus triamcinolone. 
In  summary,  in  the  gout  studies  presented  here,  the  2  proteins  both  signal  the  presence  of  acute 
inflammation and are modulated (decrease in concentration) within hours after exposure to canakinumab. 
Though taken in isolation their specificity is low, their simultaneous decrease indirectly supports the notion 
that they constitute a sensitive soluble biological marker for the inflammatory flares seen in acute gout. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-canakinumab antibodies were analyzed in serum of healthy subjects and adult patients following single 
or  multiple  administrations  of  canakinumab.  Assessments  were  done  at  specific  time  points  during  the 
treatment phase depending on the study design but always included a baseline pre-dose measurement, and 
an end of study sample. Collection of additional samples in case of anaphylaxis was implemented in all the 
clinical study protocols. 
A sample for measurement of canakinumab concentration was taken concomitantly with the one for testing 
immunogenicity to facilitate correct interpretation of the immunogenicity data. Anti-canakinumab antibodies 
in  serum  were  analyzed  by  surface  plasmon  resonance  spectroscopy  using  a  sensitive  and  validated 
Biacore®  binding  assay.  Details  on  the  immunogenicity  assay  were  provided  in  the  CAPS  dossier. 
Immunogenicity data and interpretation of results for each individual clinical study are provided with the 
reports appended to each study report. The table below is a summary table that lists the immunogenicity 
results from each of the studies.

Table 16.  Anti-canakinumab antibodies by study 
In all the blood samples tested for anti-canakinumab antibodies from gouty arthritis studies and RA studies 
listed  in  the  table  above,  only  8  of  the  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  showed  a  specific  positive 
immunogenicity. For all 8 of these patients (1 in study H2251, 7 in study H2251E1), none of the 8 patients 
had any evidence of immunogenicity-related AEs. 
In study H2251, the patient H2251-0551-00001 received canakinumab at study entry and tested positive for 
anti-canakinumab  antibodies  at  the  end  of  the  study.  The  corresponding  sample  exhibited  specific 
anti-canakinumab antibodies (inhibition signal of 30.1 % for a pre-determined positive/negative threshold 
of  30%)  but  calculated  titers  (2.343  Arbitrary  Units,  AU)  were  only  slightly  above  the  lower  limit  of 
quantification of the assay (2.806 Arbitrary Units; to note that because of assay output features, higher AU 
numbers correspond to lower concentrations). The serum clearance in this subject was 0.173 L/day, which 
is within ±25 % of the population mean clearance of 0.229 L/day.

The remaining 7 cases in the extension of the same study are of complex interpretation, and none showed 
emerging AEs that could be related to ADAs. For these 7 patients in study H2251E1, 4 received canakinumab 
in the core and no treatment in the extension, 2 took colchicine in the core and received canakinumab in the 
extension, and 1 received canakinumab in the core and was retreated with canakinumab in the extension. In 
the patient H2251E1-0058-00002, who was randomized to canakinumab in the core study and was treated 
with  canakinumab  in  the  extension  study,  specific  treatment  related  anti-canakinumab  antibodies  were 
detected (inhibition signal of 55.0% for a positive/negative threshold of 30%) on the confirmatory assay but 
the calculated titers (2.162 Arbitrary Units) were only slightly above the lower limit of quantification of the 
assay  (2.806  Arbitrary  Units).  This  patient  showed  no  unexpected  change  in  PK  data  that  suggested  a 
change in exposure, and no signs of immunogenicity related AEs were observed [CACZ885H2251E1-Section 
12.5.4].  The  6  remaining  patients  were  treated  only  once  with  canakinumab.  For  3  of  these  patients 
(H2251E1-0088-00008,  H2251E1-0521-00007 
and  H2251E1-0010-00003), 
treatment 
related 
anti-canakinumab antibodies were detected (inhibition signal above the negative cut-off of 30%) but titers 
remained below the lower limit of quantification (2.806 Arbitrary Units) and therefore not measurable. For 
the  3  other  patients  (H2251E1-0080-00003,  H2251E1-0088-  00009  and  H2251E1-0121-00003),  titers 
(respectively 2.144, 1.927 and 2.366 Arbitrary Units) were slightly above the lower limit of quantification 
(2.806 Arbitrary Units). None of these 6 patients showed unexpected change in PK data and/or had any 
evidence of immunogenicity-related AEs. The serum clearance values in these 7 patients ranged from 0.113 
to 0.333 L/day, which is within ±50 % of the population mean clearance of 0.229 L/day, thereby showing no 
unexpected  PK  behavior.  It  can  be  concluded  that  the  presence  of  anti-canakinumab  antibodies  had  no 
impact on the PK or the clinical efficacy / safety in the patients exposed to canakinumab. 
In CAPS patients from D2306 and not listed in the table above, with the analytical method used (i.e. Biacore, 
with  detection  based  on  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance),  none  of  the  patients  tested  for  anti-ACZ885 
antibodies  showed  a  test  positivity.  For  10  out  of  the  166  patients  tested,  the  ability  to  detect 
immunogenicity may have been compromised due to high drug levels even in the samples taken at study 
completion. Therefore a weak immune response might not have been detected in 10 out of the 166 patients. 
This limitation of the assay was not present in the samples form the gouty arthritis program, where exposure 
was limited to 1 to 3 doses of 150 mg sc. 
1.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The assays used for determination of canakinumab and total IL-1ß in serum were the same as those used 
during the studies presented in the former CAPS application. 
Using  the  population  PK  model,  a  steady  state  value  for  Cmax  and  AUCtau  of  11.3  μg/mL  and  383.8 
μg·day/mL,  respectively,  was  estimated  for  the  whole  gout  population.  Since  a  12  weeks  interval  was 
applied  for  this  calculation,  the  values  should  be  quite  similar  to  a  single  dose  application.  Thus,  the 
observed  single  dose  exposure  in  the  gout  population  is  markedly  lower  than  derived  from  adult  CAPS 
patients receiving the same dose (Cmax: 15.9 ± 3.52 (SD) µg/mL, AUCinf 708 µg*d/mL). 
Accordingly, population PK model parameter estimates of Vss and CLD (drug clearance) for a typical gouty 
arthritis patient (93 kg BW) were higher than those estimated for the typical adult CAPS patient (Vss: 7.8 vs. 
6 L; CLD: 0.23 vs. 0.17  L/d) with underlying similar assumptions for bioavailability (F: 59.5 and 63.3 %).  
All  other  parameter  values  (Ka  (absorption  rate  const),  CLL  (CL  of  uncomplexed  ligand)  PSD 
(intercompartmental permeability flow) and KD (binding constant to IL-1ß) were in good agreement with 
those estimated for the CAPS population. Half-life (t1/2) of canakinumab in adult gouty arthritis patients was 
estimated to be 25.6 days which is also in good agreement with the estimation for the CAPS population 
(26.1d). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 31/136 
 
 
  
 
Overall, there is lower exposure (lower Cmax and AUC, higher clearance) in the gout population studied 
compared  to  the  CAPS  population.  This  is  obviously  due  to  the  known  influence  of  body  weight  on  the 
canakinumab clearance: The gouty arthritis patients treated with canakinumab in study H2356 had a mean 
BW of 96.2 kg (range 62.2 – 140 kg), i.e. much higher than the formerly studied adult CAPS population 
(range  43-77  kg).  Since  there  is  a  known  marked  effect  of  BW  on  CL,  the  observed  lower  exposure  of 
canakinumab  in  these  patients  compared  to  CAPS  adults  appears  plausible.    This  is  confirmed  by  the 
population estimate of canakinumab clearance of 0.181 L/d when normalized to the weight of 70 kg, which 
is in good agreement for the values estimated for the CAPS population with the same body weight (0.17 
L/d). 
The gout population studied was in a body weight range (> 80 kg) which is at the upper limit where the dose 
per kg falls below 2 mg/kg.  
Multiple dose PK measurements in the target population are limited to 20 patients during the pivotal study 
H2356. The dosage regimen for the claimed indication is 150 mg s.c. single dose per attack with a minimum 
interval of twelve weeks between doses.  
Linear  pharmacokinetics  with  dose-proportionality  has  been  demonstrated  within  and  across  studies  in 
healthy subjects, RA patients and CAPS patients. This could also be observed in one study in gouty arthritis 
patients on UALT over a dose range of 25 mg to 300 mg s.c. (H2251). However, in a second dose-finding 
study H2255 in gouty arthritis patients an indication of nonlinear PK behaviour was observed. CL/F and V/F 
increased dose-dependently (10 mg s.c. up to 150 mg s.c.). It was clarified by the MAH during the evaluation 
that there was in study H2255 in the 10 mg group a patient with unusually higher concentrations relate to 
the other patients (outlier). The dose normalised Cmax values were otherwise consistent across the dose 
ranges studies in study H2255.   
Absolute Bioavailability could not be properly calculated from parallel IV and SC groups in studies in the 
target  population  due  to  limited  IV  data  in  the  target  population.  It  was  estimated  by  population  PK 
modelling  for  the  different  product  types  over  all  populations  studied  in  the  different  PK  studies.    The 
estimated absolute bioavailability of canakinumab (mean ± SEM) after s.c. administration for Product Types 
A, B, C, D was 60.9 ± 3.74, 64.8 ± 4.14, 69.4 ± 4.39, and 59.5 ± 3.74%, respectively. The value of about 
60% for product type A and D is in line with the estimation of 63 % (for product type A) in the population PK 
analysis of the CAPS population. 
Clearance  of  canakinumab  in  the  gout  population  appeared  to  be  independent  of  age  and  gender  but 
dependent on body weight which is already known from the CAPS population. Although a small influence of 
impaired renal function (CrCL) on canakinumab clearance was found, neither renal nor hepatic impairment 
is considered to be a limiting factor for the elimination of canakinumab. 
Pharmacodynamcis 
Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β (not to IL-1α or IL-1ra), and blocks the interaction of this cytokine with 
its receptors, thereby functionally neutralizing its bioactivity. The resulting complex of canakinumab and 
IL-1β is supposed to be eliminated at a much slower rate than the free IL-1β, resulting in elevation of total 
IL-1β  (free  plus  complex)  following  canakinumab  administration.  Thus,  measurement  of  free  plus 
complexed IL-1β, i.e. total IL-1β, is determined as a biomarker for canakinumab indicative of binding of 
IL-1β by the antibody. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 32/136 
 
 
  
 
After canakinumab dosing, in vivo binding of canakinumab to IL-1β is confirmed in all gouty arthritis patient 
trials based on the increase in total IL-1β, similar to the results observed in other populations (CAPS, RA, 
psoriasis, asthma, healthy subjects). The increase in total IL-1β was observed for all the drug forms used 
including the current market form (Product Type D). After a single dose of 150 mg s.c. canakinumab a rise 
of total IL-1ß levels up to 50 pg/mL were observed. The time course of total IL-1ß appears to reflect the 
endogenous production rate of Il-1ß and the elimination of the complex built. The binding parameters were 
estimated  by  the  PK-binding  model  and  reported  below  as  mean  ±SEM.  The  clearance  of  IL-1β  was 
calculated  to  be  10.9  ±  0.986  L/day  in  gouty  arthritis  patients,  with  a  terminal  half-life  of  3.7  days. 
Endogenous IL-1β production rate estimated by the  PK-binding model varied with study population; the 
value was 7.69 ± 0.628 ng/day in gouty arthritis patients, and about 33% higher in CAPS. The ability of 
canakinumab to bind to IL-1β is captured by the apparent in vivo dissociation constant, Kd, with a population 
estimate of 1.07 ± 0.0742 nM in gouty arthritis patients.  
In contrast to the studies in CAPS patients, in the studies with gouty arthritis patients the inflammation 
biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) have also been evaluated. The two 
proteins  both  signal  the  presence  of  acute  inflammation  and  are  modulated  (decrease  in  concentration) 
within  hours  after  exposure  to  canakinumab.  Though  taken  in  isolation  their  specificity  is  low,  their 
simultaneous  decrease  indirectly  supports  the  notion  that  they  constitute  a  sensitive  soluble  biological 
marker for the inflammatory flares seen in acute gout. 
In all the blood samples tested for anti-canakinumab antibodies from gouty arthritis studies and RA studies, 
only  8  of  the  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  (total  number:  1551)  showed  a  specific  positive 
immunogenicity. All 8 patients were found in one study (1 in H2251 and 7 in its extension H2251E1, total 
patient number: 100). Only one patient thereof received two doses of canakinumab. All titers were reported 
to be very low and none of the 8 patients had any evidence of immunogenicity-related AEs. 
1.5.5.  Conclusions on Clinical Pharmacology 
The observed single dose exposure with canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients is lower than derived from 
adults CAPS patients receiving the same dose. Population PK parameters (Vss and Cl) were higher than in 
CAPS patients. The mean half-life was similar than observed in CAPS patients. Clearance of canakinumab in 
gouty  arthritis  patients  was  independent  of  age  and  gender  but  dependent  on  body  weight  (as  in  CAPs 
patients).Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and blocks the interaction of this cytokine with its receptors. 
After a single dose of 150 mg of canakinumab a rise of total IL-1β levels was observed with a time course 
reflecting endogenous production rate and elimination. In the studies in gouty arthritis patients, both the 
CRP and SAA, two inflammation markers were elevated. 
1.6.  Clinical efficacy 
1.6.1.  Dose response studies 
Study  H2255  was  a  phase  II,  adaptive  dose-ranging,  multi-center,  single-blind,  double  dummy, 
active-controlled trial to determine the target dose of canakinumab in the treatment of acute flares in gouty 
arthritis patients who are refractory or contraindicated to treatment with NSAIDs and/or colchicine. 
A total of 200 patients with acute flares of gouty arthritis (meeting the ACR 1977 preliminary criteria) were 
randomized to one of 5 single doses of canakinumab (10, 25, 50, 90 or 150 mg s.c.) or 1 single dose of 
triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg i.m.). Patients were followed for 8 weeks, for efficacy data in week 1 and 
safety and supportive efficacy data in weeks 2-8.

Table 17.  Summary of dose-finding trials 
The  main  inclusion  criteria  were:  acute  gout  flare  (≤5  days),  pain  intensity  of  ≥50  mm  on  a  pain  VAS, 
refractory or with contraindication to NSAIDs and/or colchicine, and if on urate lowering therapy it had to be 
stable. The main exclusion criteria were use of specific pain relieving drugs or other anti IL-1 agents within 
specified times before study entry. The groups were well-balanced, except for a marginally lower baseline 
pain (VAS) severity in the 150 mg canakinumab group.  
The primary efficacy criterion was pain intensity (assessed at baseline and each subsequent visit) on a pain 
VAS (0 to 100 mm), measured at 72 hours after dosing. Secondary efficacy criteria included time to 50% 
reduction in pain, time to recurrence of flare, pain intensity at other time points, pain on the 5-point Likert 
scale, the use of rescue medication, patient’s & physician’s global assessment of response to treatment and 
safety variables (AEs, SAEs, injection site reactions). 
The stated statistical primary objective was to determine the dose providing the same primary efficacy as 
triamcinolone  acetonide  40  mg  i.m.,  but  the  broader  clinical  objective  was  to  identify  an  adequately 
efficacious and well-tolerated dose for use in phase III studies, based on all efficacy and safety variables. 
Statistically significant dose response relationships were seen at 72 hours (primary endpoint), with the dose 
of  150  mg  being  statistically  and  clinically  superior  to  triamcinolone  acetonide  while  the  differences  to 
triamcinolone acetonide for the 10, 25, 50, and 90 mg s.c. doses were less.  
The 150 mg s.c. dose showed a statistically significantly greater effect than triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg 
i.m. over 1-5 days and at 7 days, with a treatment difference in pain VAS of 19.2 mm at 72- hours (primary 
endpoint) and statistically significant treatment differences relative to triamcinolone acetonide from as early 
as 24 hours. 
During the 8-weeks of observation, fewer patients had a new flare with each canakinumab dose than with 
triamcinolone acetonide (Kaplan Meier estimates of 4 to 14% with canakinumab, compared to 45% with 
triamcinolone acetonide), and canakinumab 150 mg showed a >90% reduction in the risk of flare compared 
to triamcinolone acetonide. 
Consistent with these findings, the use of rescue medication was reduced with canakinumab compared to 
triamcinolone  acetonide  and  better  efficacy  was  reported  for  the  physicians’  assessment  of  erythema, 
tenderness and swelling and both the patient’s and physician’s global assessments. 
1.6.2.  Main studies 
Two  pivotal  phase  III  studies,  studies  H2356  and  H2357,  were  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  support  this 
extension of indication. These two studies employed a 12 week, randomized, double blind, double dummy, 
controlled study design.

Methods (for both studies H2356 and H2357) 
Studies  H2356  and  H2357  had  a  12-week,  multicenter,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  active  controlled 
clinical study design (as shown in the figure below) to demonstrate that in patients with frequent flares of 
gout for whom NSAIDs and/ or colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, canakinumab 150 
mg s.c. given upon acute gout flares relieves the signs and symptoms and prevents recurrence of gout flares 
compared to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. 
The efficacy criteria were superiority in 2 co-primary variables (pain intensity at 72 hours and time to first 
new gouty arthritis flare), both to be met at the one-sided 2.5% level.  
Figure 8. 
Study design (pivotal studies) 
Both studies have double blind active controlled extensions to 24 weeks in which patients are treated upon 
flare with the same treatment they were allocated during the 12 week core study. 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Patients  eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  study  were  to  meet  the  ACR  1977  preliminary  criteria  for  the 
classification of acute arthritis of primary gout, have onset of current acute gout flare within 5 days prior to 
randomization, show a patient’s assessment of baseline pain intensity ≥ 50 mm on the 0-100 mm VAS, and 
a  history  of  ≥  3  gout  flares  within  the  12  months  prior  to  randomization.  Evidence  of  contraindication 
(absolute or relative), or intolerance, or lack of efficacy for NSAIDs and/or colchicine was needed. If on urate 
lowering therapy (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticase, probenecid), they had to be on stable dose and 
schedule with no changes in therapy for 2 weeks prior to randomization and expected to remain on a stable 
regimen during study participation

Treatment 
The MAH supplied canakinumab (labeled as ACZ885) and its placebo dummy in individual 6 mL glass vials 
each containing nominally 150 mg canakinumab (plus 20% overfill) or placebo powder as a lyophilized cake. 
Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg was the comparator for these two studies. A lipid emulsion which was similar 
in appearance to triamcinolone acetonide was used as an i.m. placebo injection.  
Patients were assigned to one of the following treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1: 
•  Canakinumab 150 mg 
• 
Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg

Objectives 
Primary objective 
The two co-primary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
To confirm that canakinumab 150 mg s.c. was superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. with 
respect to patient’s assessment of gout pain intensity in the joint most affected at baseline at 72 
hours post-dose (on a 0-100 mm VAS) 
To confirm that canakinumab 150 mg s.c. was superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. with 
respect to the time to the first new gout flare 
Secondary objectives 
The main secondary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the time to complete resolution of pain in the joint most affected at baseline (Likert 
scale) 
To evaluate the time to 50% reduction of baseline pain intensity in the most affected joint 
Proportion of patients taking rescue medication 
To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab as compared to triamcinolone acetonide with regards to the 
SF-36v2 (acute version) physical function component 
Sample size 
Both trials were designed to show superior efficacy for canakinumab 150 mg compared to triamcinolone 
acetonide 40 mg with respect to pain intensity at 72 hours post-dose and time to first new gout flare. 
The sample size assumptions were based on interim results from the phase II acute gout study H2255. 
A sample size of 110 in each group would have 94% power to detect a difference in mean pain score (VAS) 
in the most affected joint of 12 mm, assuming that the common standard deviation was 25, using a two 
group t-test with a 0.025 one-sided significance level. 
At the time of the interim analysis for the phase II trial, a proportion of 0.96 of patients in the canakinumab 
150  mg  group  (n=27)  did  not  have  a  new  flare  compared  to  a  proportion  of  0.61  of  patients  in  the 
triamcinolone acetonide arm (n=56) during the 8 week study period. 
Assuming that more patients would flare during a 12 week study period, a sample size of 110 in each group 
would have a 96% power to detect a difference in proportion of 0.25 without new gout flare at week 12, a 
proportion  of  0.75  in  the  canakinumab  group  and  0.5  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group,  using  a 
one-sided 0.025 level log-rank test for equality of survival curves. 
As both co-primary endpoints need to be met, the sample size of 110 per group would result in an overall 
power of approximately 90%.

Randomisation  
At Visit 1, the investigator confirmed whether the patient fulfilled criteria for entry into the study. If so, then 
the investigator instructed an independent, unblinded qualified study person to call the IVRS to randomize 
the patient and obtain the assigned treatment arm. All eligible patients were given a randomization number 
from IVRS that assigned them to one of the treatment arms. 
Blinding 
Patients and data analysts remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization 
until database lock.  
Statistical methods 
The Randomized Set consisted of all subjects randomized. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients as randomized that have at least one post-baseline VAS 
assessment. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the treatment they 
were assigned to at randomization. 
For  the  efficacy  analysis,  as  both  co-primary  objectives  had  to  be  met,  there  was  no  adjustment  for 
multiplicity. The hypotheses were tested at a one-sided 2.5% level. 
For the first set of secondary endpoints, the Bonferroni-Holm method was used to adjust for multiplicity in 
the  evaluation  of  these  four  efficacy  variables.  In  order  to  do  this,  the  hypotheses  of  superiority  of 
canakinumab 150 mg for the k=4 variables above were tested and the p-values ordered. If the smallest 
p-value was less than 0.0125 (0.05/k), then the corresponding hypothesis was rejected. If the next p-value 
was less than 0.05/k-1, then that hypothesis was also rejected. The remaining hypotheses were tested in 
the same manner. This continued until the hypothesis with the smallest p-value could not be rejected. At 
that point, no more hypotheses were evaluated. 
The Safety Set consisted of all patients that received study drug and had at least one post baseline safety 
assessment. Patients were analyzed according to treatment received. 
Results 
Study H2356 
Participant flow 
A total of 230 patients were randomized, 115 to each treatment group (see table below). More than 90% of 
patients  in  either  treatment  group  completed  the  study.  Overall,  more  patients  discontinued  in  the 
triamcinolone  acetonide  group  compared  with  the  canakinumab  group  (8.7%  vs.  5.2%),  and  the  most 
relevant difference seen was in the number of patients discontinuing due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect 
(4 patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group vs. no patients in the canakinumab group). There were no 
other  meaningful  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  the 
study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013

One patient, in the triamcinolone acetonide group, died prior to study completion. There were otherwise no 
adverse events leading to study discontinuation. 
Table 18.  Patient disposition by treatment (Randomized set) 
Two patients randomized to canakinumab were not included in the safety or full analysis sets as they did not 
receive  any  study  medication.  Supplies  were  not  available  for  these  patients  at  the  site  on  the  day  of 
randomization and they were discontinued from the study on the same day (with the primary reason listed 
as administrative problems). 
Table 19.  Analysis set by treatment (Randomized set) 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended twice. The key features of each amendment are given below:  
Amendment 1 (11-Sep-2009) was issued (prior to the first patient first visit, 04-Dec-2009) to expand the 
patient population. 
Amendment  2  (09-Feb-2010)  was  issued  to  define  required  washout  periods  for  NSAIDs  and  other  pain 
medication  at  the  time  of  screening,  as  intake  of  such  medication  could  confound  the  patients  pain 
assessment at Visit 1. In addition, changes to the analysis plan were made as a result of discussions with the 
health authorities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013

These amendments were not considered to have affected the interpretation of study results as they were 
minor and occurred prior to study unblinding. 
Baseline data 
Baseline  demographic  and  background  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  for  the  two  treatment 
groups  (see  tables  below).  The  majority  of  patients  were  Caucasian  and  male,  and  54  years  of  age  on 
average. The mean BMI was approximately 32 kg/m2. 
Table 20.  Demographic and background characteristics by treatment (safety set) 
Baseline disease characteristics were generally comparable between the two treatment groups (see tables 
below). 
The canakinumab group had a lower proportion of patients with a > 10 year history of gout compared with 
the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  (24.8%  vs.  39.1%,  respectively);  however,  there  was  no  statistically 
significant difference between the two treatment groups in gout history overall (p=0.0694). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 40/136 
 
 
 
  
 
Approximately 45% of all patients suffered from monoarticular gout. There were some differences between 
the  treatment  groups  in  the  numbers  of  patients  with  oligoarticular  (32.7%  canakinumab  vs.  43.5% 
triamcinolone acetonide) or polyarticular (22.1% canakinumab vs. 12.2% triamcinolone acetonide) gout. 
However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in acute gout 
classification overall (p=0.0809). 
The  two  treatment  groups  had  comparable  median  numbers  of  flares  in  the  previous  year  (4  for 
canakinumab and 5 for triamcinolone acetonide). The proportion of patients with >6 flares in the past year 
was lower in the canakinumab group (25.7%) compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (33.0%) 
but  the  overall  number  of  flares  experienced  was  not  significantly  different  between  treatment  groups 
(p=0.2213). 
The physician’s assessment showed nearly all patients had joint tenderness, which was evidenced as pain 
(20.2%), pain and wincing (44.3%), or pain, wincing and withdrawal (35.1%). Visible joint swelling was 
seen for 60.5% of the patients and 30.7% showed bulging beyond the joint margins. Erythema was present 
for the majority of patients (85.5%). Tophi were present in 39% of the patients.

A total of 23 patients (12 in the canakinumab group and 11 in the triamcinolone acetonide group) had data 
available  at  baseline.  The  majority  of  these  patients  had  tophi  (91.7%  vs.  63.6%,  respectively), 
inflammation (58.3% vs. 72.7%, respectively), erosions (83.3% vs. 90.9%, respectively), and suspected 
urate crystal deposits (75.0% vs. 54.5%) present.

The  majority  of  the  patients  had  comorbidities  present  at  baseline  (86.8%)  which  included  stable 
hypertension  (70.2%),  obesity  (57.5%),  metabolic  syndrome  (36.4%),  hypercholesterolemia  (27.6%), 
chronic  kidney  disease  (14.5%),  on  stable  cholesterol  lowering  treatments  (13.6%),  diabetes  (11.4%), 
stable coronary artery disease (11.0%), and current or prior symptoms of heart failure (5.3%). There were 
no  relevant  differences  between  the  two  treatment  groups,  with  the  exception  of  metabolic  syndrome 
(41.6% canakinumab vs. 31.3% triamcinolone acetonide). 
The majority of patients (93.9%) had a relevant medical history or continuing medical condition that was 
active at study start. The most common active medical histories by system organ class (i.e., ≥20.0%) were 
vascular  disorders  (72.4%),  metabolic  and  nutrition  disorders  (74.6%),  cardiac  disorders  (29.4%),  and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (20.2%). The most common active medical histories by 
preferred term (i.e., ≥20.0%) were hypertension (57.5%), obesity (52.6%), metabolic syndrome (21.1%), 
and  hypercholesterolemia  (20.6%).  Generally,  the  treatment  groups  were  comparable  regarding  active 
medical histories. The profile of active medical histories was as expected for this patient population. 
Outcomes and estimations 
Co-primary endpoints 
Pain intensity measured by 0-100 mm VAS at 72 hours post-dose 
Pain intensity as measured by the 0-100 mm VAS was statistically significantly lower for the canakinumab 
treatment  group  compared  with  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  at  72  hours  post-dose  (LS  mean 
difference of -11.4 mm; p=0.0005) (see table below) 
Table 22.  Pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS): ANCOVA at 72 hours post-dose, by treatment (Full 
analysis set) 
To  incorporate  the  time-dependent  relationships  between  repeated  assessments  of  VAS,  a  supportive 
analysis using the repeated measures GEE (Generalized estimating equations) was performed to examine 
the  VAS  profile  over  the  72  hours  post-baseline.  The  results  confirmed  those  of  the  primary  analysis 
(estimated mean difference of – 8.6 mm; p=0.0003). 
Additionally, AUC(0-72) of pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS) showed patients treated with canakinumab had 
less pain by approximately 10 mm, on average, throughout the first 72 hours, compared to patients treated 
with triamcinolone acetonide . 
Time to first new gout flare 
Over  12  weeks  following  randomization,  the  probability  of  new  gout  flares  was  lower  for  canakinumab 
compared  with  triamcinolone  acetonide  (Kaplan-Meier  estimates:  18.9%  vs.  36.5%,  respectively).  This 
corresponds to a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 55% for time to first new gout flare (hazard 
ratio of 0.45; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.76; p=0.0014) (see table and figure below).

Analysis Set) 
Proportion of patients taking rescue medication 
The proportion of patients who took rescue medication was lower in the canakinumab group compared with 
the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  (31.0%  vs.  52.2%,  respectively).  Patients  in  the  canakinumab  group 
were  less  likely  to  take  rescue  medication  compared  with  patients  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group 
(odds ratio of 0.42; p=0.0022). 
Table 25.  Rescue medication intake: Estimated odds ratio, by treatment (Full Analysis Set) 
Time to 50% reduction of baseline pain intensity 
The time to at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain (0-100 mm VAS) was less with canakinumab than with 
triamcinolone acetonide (median=48 hours vs. 72 hours, respectively). There was a 47% greater chance for 
good  pain  reduction  (i.e.,  at  least  a  50%  reduction  in  baseline  pain)  with  canakinumab  relative  to 
triamcinolone acetonide (hazard ratio of 1.47; p=0.0103). 
The figure below presents the Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to at least 50% reduction in baseline pain 
intensity (VAS). There was little difference between the treatment groups over the first 12 hours post-dose, 
however, at 24 hours, approximately 40% of the patients in the canakinumab group achieved at least a 50% 
reduction in pain compared with approximately 30% in the triamcinolone acetonide group. From 24 hours 
post-dose to the last time point measured (7 days post-dose) the odds ratios ranged from 1.95 to 2.44 
indicating that patients in  the canakinumab group were more likely to have at least a 50% reduction in 
baseline pain intensity compared with patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group (all, p<0.05).

Time to complete resolution of pain 
Over  7  days  following  randomization,  the  likelihood  of  complete  resolution  of  pain  was  higher  for 
canakinumab compared with triamcinolone acetonide but the difference was small (Kaplan-Meier estimates: 
34.5% vs. 31.3%, respectively). There was only a negligible difference between the two treatment groups 
(hazard ratio of 1.09; p=0.7227).

SF-36v2 Questionnaire (physical component) at end of study 
The two treatment groups showed similar improvements in the SF-36 physical function score at the end of 
the study (see table below).

The  mean  scores  at  baseline  were  29.98  and  30.88  for  canakinumab  and  triamcinolone  acetonide, 
respectively.  Improvements  were  seen  for  both  treatment  groups  at  all  time  points  post-dose:  4  weeks 
(mean  changes  of  14.76  and  13.14,  respectively),  8  weeks  (mean  changes  of  16.35  and  14.60, 
respectively), and 12 weeks (mean changes of 16.42 and 14.46, respectively). 
Study H2357 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  226  patients  were  randomized  to  treatment,  112  to  canakinumab  150  mg  s.c.  and  114  to 
triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m. (Table below). Nearly 90% of patients across both treatment groups 
completed  the  study.  The  rate  of  study  discontinuation  was  similar  between  the  two  groups  (11.6%  for 
canakinumab vs. 9.6% for triamcinolone acetonide). The most common reasons for study discontinuation 
were withdrawal of consent (4.4% in total) and lost to follow (3.5%). One patient in each group discontinued 
due to abnormal laboratory values. 
One patient in the canakinumab group died prior to study completion. There were otherwise no AEs leading 
to study discontinuation. 
Table 27.  Patient disposition by treatment (Randomized set) 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended once. The key features of each amendment are given below: 
Amendment 1 (23-Feb-2010) was issued before the first patient first visit (05-Mar-2010). The main purpose 
of the amendment was to revise the source for the supply of comparator drug (triamcinolone acetonide and 
matching placebo) to allow the sites to obtain the  comparator from Novartis or  from  a  third  party  or to 
purchase it on their own. Minor editorial changes were also made. 
Changes introduced with this amendment were not considered to have affected the interpretation of study 
results as they were minor and occurred prior to study start.

The  canakinumab  group  had  a  slightly  lower  proportion  of  patients  suffering  from  gout  for  >10  years 
compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (36.6% vs. 44.7%), but overall there was no significant 
difference between the two treatment groups in the duration of gout history (p=0.2343). Both treatment 
groups had predominantly monoarticular gout (58.9% canakinumab and 62.3% triamcinolone acetonide), 
followed by oligoarticular gout (20.5% and 24.6%, respectively) and polyarticular gout (20.5% and 13.2%, 
respectively). Both treatment groups had a median of 5 gout flares in the previous year before study entry. 
In  the  past  year,  most  patients  in  both  groups  had  3-6  gout  flares  (72.3%  canakinumab  and  78.9% 
triamcinolone acetonide), similar proportions had >6 gout flares (27.7% and 21.1%, respectively). 
The physician’s assessment showed nearly all patients had joint tenderness, which was evidenced as pain 
(13.3%), pain and wincing (34.1%), or pain, wincing and withdrawal (51.8%). Palpable swelling was seen 
for  13.3%  of  all  patients,  visible  swelling  for  45.1%  and  bulging  beyond  the  joint  margins  for  40.3%. 
Erythema was present for 82.3% of patients, and tophi were present for 19.0%.

Outcomes and estimations 
Co-primary endpoints 
Pain intensity measured by 0-100 mm VAS 
Canakinumab 150 mg provided statistically superior reductions in pain intensity as measured by 0-100 mm 
VAS  compared  with  triamcinolone  acetonide  40  mg  at  72  hours  post-dose.  The  estimated  treatment 
difference of - 9.8 mm was statistically significant (p=0.0018) (see table below). 
Table 30.  Pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS): ANCOVA at 72 hours post-dose by treatment (Full 
analysis set) 
To incorporate time-dependent relationships between repeated assessments of VAS, a repeated measures 
GEE (Generalized estimating equations) analysis was performed to examine the VAS profile over the 72 
hours post-baseline. The results confirmed those of the primary analysis (estimated treatment difference of 
- 5.56; 95% CI - 10.8 to - 0.28; p=0.0195). 
Additionally, AUC of pain intensity (0-100 mm VAS) showed that patients treated with canakinumab had 6.2 
mm less pain, on average, throughout the first 72 hours post-dose compared with patients treated with 
triamcinolone  acetonide.  Over  168  hours  post-dose,  the  difference  was  7.4  mm  on  average  in  favor  of 
canakinumab. 
Time to first new flare 
Over  12  weeks  following  randomization,  the  probability  of  new  gout  flares  was  lower  for  canakinumab 
compared with triamcinolone acetonide (Kaplan-Meier estimates: 14.2% vs. 38.2%) (see table and figure 
below). This corresponds to a statistically significant risk reduction of 68% for time to first new gout flare 
which was statistically significant (hazard ratio of 0.32; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58; p<0.0001).

The first set of secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
• 
• 
Time to complete resolution of pain in the most affected joint (pain intensity on Likert scale = none)

Table 32.  Key secondary efficacy variables: summary of Bonferroni-Holm adjusted results (Full 
analysis set) 
The median time to complete resolution of pain (defined as no pain on the Likert scale) was achieved at Day 
6 (144 hours) with canakinumab, but could not be estimated with triamcinolone acetonide as less than 50% 
of patients in the comparator group met this endpoint within the observation period for the acute flare (7 
days).  The  two-sided  p-value  of  0.0130  was  slightly  above  the  statistical  significance  threshold  set  at  p 
0.0125.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  took  rescue  medication  during  the  baseline  gout  flare  was 
numerically lower with canakinumab (43.8%) than with triamcinolone acetonide (57.0%), with a two-sided 
p-value of 0.0214. 
The median time to 50% reduction in pain as measured VAS was numerically shorter with canakinumab (25 
hours) than with triamcinolone acetonide (48 hours) for the baseline flare. 
Improvements in the SF-36 physical function scale were seen in both treatment groups at the end of study. 
No difference between the treatment arms was observed (LS mean score at end of study: 81.5 canakinumab 
and 78.8 triamcinolone acetonide).

The figure above shows the Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain 
intensity (VAS). There was little difference between the treatment groups over the first 24 hours post-dose. 
Thereafter  the  treatment  groups  began  to  differentiate,  with  the  canakinumab  group  having  higher 
proportions of patients achieving 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity compared with the triamcinolone 
acetonide group.  
At 72 hours post-dose, 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity was observed in 78.4% of patients in the 
canakinumab group and 60.6% patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group. The estimated odds ratio was 
2.32 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.22; p=0.0059), indicating that patients treated with canakinumab were more likely 
to achieve at least a 50% reduction in baseline pain intensity at 72 hours post-dose than patients treated 
with triamcinolone acetonide. A similar result was observed at 5 days post-dose: 50% reduction in baseline 
pain  intensity  was  seen  in  81.1%  of  canakinumab-treated  patients  vs.  66.1%  of  patients  treated  with 
triamcinolone acetonide, and this difference was statistically significant in favor of canakinumab (odds ratio 
2.12;  95%  CI  1.14  to  3.96;  p=0.0180).  Although  significant  differences  were  not  observed  at  other 
timepoints, the trend was similar with odds ratios ranging from 1.22 to 1.76. 
•  Proportion of patients taking rescue medication during the first week 
Table 34.  Rescue medication intake: Estimated odds ratio by treatment (Full analysis set) 
The most common type of rescue medication taken during the baseline flare was acetaminophen (36.6% in 
the canakinumab group and 50.0% in the triamcinolone acetonide group), followed by codeine (18.8% and 
23.7%) and prednisolone/prednisone (12.5% and 20.2%). The mean amounts of all 3 rescue medications 
(in  mg)  were  lower  in  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  than  in  patients  treated  with  triamcinolone 
acetonide.

Pooled data are similar to the efficacy results that are already presented separately for studies H2356 and

Clinical studies in special populations 
There  were  no  differences  in  efficacy  compared  to  the  overall  study  population  among  demographic 
subgroups (age, sex, race, BMI) and in patients with over or under 6 flares in the past year. 
Subgroup analysis in patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine 
The efficacy analyses were re-run for the subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine. 
Treatment comparisons were performed for patients who were contraindicated/intolerant to/lack of efficacy 
for NSAIDs and colchicine and patients who were able to use at least one of the 2 treatments. The subgroup 
by  treatment  interaction  is  provided  to  see  if  any  differences  existed  in  efficacy  responses.  None  of  the 
treatment by subgroup interaction terms was statistically significant which indicates no relevant treatment 
differences exist among the two subgroups for all six variables. The findings are summarized in the table 
below.

Canakinumab remained statistically significantly better than triamcinolone acetonide for pain intensity, time 
to 1st new flare, and time to first rescue medication use. The two exceptions were the time to 50% reduction 
in VAS pain, where there was not a significant treatment difference in the subgroup of patients able to take 
either NSAIDs or colchicine, and in the time to complete resolution of pain for the baseline flare, where the 
subgroup unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine did not have a statistically significant difference in favor 
of canakinumab. 
In each case and for all the measured efficacy outcomes, the subgroup by treatment interaction was not 
statistically significant, suggesting that overall, patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine responded in 
the same way to canakinumab treatment as those who were able to take either one of these therapies. 
Table 38.  Pooled analysis: Efficacy responses of patients able/unable to use NSAIDs and 
colchicine 
The characteristics of patients with little or no response to treatment at the baseline flare who re-flare, failed 
to show any demographic, or disease features that correlated with this low response. The only predictive 
factor identified was that in patients who re-flare the response to the baseline flare was closely related to the 
response to a subsequent flare: 
Good (≥50% reduction in VAS pain) response to treatment predicted good response to retreatment (75%), 
and weak response (<50% reduction in VAS pain) to treatment was a good predictor of weak response to 
re-treatment (83%), as seen in Table 4-13. Thus, the response to re-treatment appears to be predictable 
based on the response to the baseline flare. 
The data to support this predictability is limited as they include 2 patients with strong baseline responses 
who  supplied  no  data  for  the  last  flare  but  were  classified  as  non  responders  (baseline  observation  was 
carried forward). The exclusion of these patients raises the good response from 75% to 83% (15/18) and 
lowers  the  estimate  of  patients  with  a  strong  initial  and  poor  last  response  from  25%  to  17%  (3/18). 
However, more data are needed as this dataset is small.

Table 39.  Degree of VAS pain relief (first and last flare) 
The time of treatment after the start of the flare (0-1, 2, 3, ≥4 days after flare start) affected the VAS pain 
response and the frequency of resolution to no pain on the Likert score. Although mean VAS baseline pain at 
73 or 74 mm was very similar in all subgroups, the extent of pain relief and frequency of resolution differed. 
Greatest pain relief and frequency of complete resolution were seen when treatment was given early after 
flare started, for both treatment groups.  
Use of urate lowering therapy 
There were no significant differences in VAS pain reduction by use of urate lowering drugs. The fall in VAS 
pain  was  significantly  greater  with  canakinumab  than  triamcinolone  acetonide  with  and  without  urate 
lowering drugs.  
Probability for recurrent flare was consistently low with canakinumab in both subgroups and was statistically 
below  that  for  triamcinolone  acetonide  without  urate  lowering  drugs.  With  urate  lowering  drugs 
triamcinolone  acetonide  became  more  effective,  therefore  this  comparison,  although  still  favoring 
canakinumab, was not statistically significant.  
Patients using urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group had a 28% reduction in the risk of the first 
new flare compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group (hazard ratio of 0.72; 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.32; 
p=0.14), (see table below). While the patients not using urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group 
had a 76% statistically significant reduction in the risk of the first new flare compared with the triamcinolone 
acetonide group (hazard ratio of 0.24; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.41; p<0.0001). 
Table 40.  Subgroup analysis of time to 1st new flare for urate lowering therapy (UALT) 
The  treatment  by  subgroup  interaction  between  usage  of  urate  lowering  therapy  and  treatment  was 
statistically significant (p=0.0084), indicating a potential difference in effect size of canakinumab, between 
the two subgroups.

Patients with appropriate management of uricaemia 
A subgroup analysis has been defined patients, who are: 
• 
• 
unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine (as per Section 2.1.1.1.1), and 
who are on ULT, or previously failed on ULT, or are contraindicated to ULT 
These  patients,  unable  to  use  NSAIDs  and  colchicine,  who  were  on  ULT,  failed  ULT  or  where  ULT  was 
contraindicated, included over 100 patients. The findings in this subgroup were consistent with the efficacy 
and safety results from the overall Phase III population. 
Demographics and disease history 
Patient demographics and disease history were comparable between treatment groups. 
Efficacy 
Pain intensity (0-100mm VAS) over the first 7 days is presented in the table below. At all timepoints tested 
there was at least a numerical advantage favoring canakinumab over triamcinolone acetonide reflected by 
the point estimate. At early timepoints pain is numerically in favor of canakinumab with a 3mm benefit after 
6 & 12 hours and 6.7mm after 24 hours. Estimated differences in pain intensity between 48 hours and 7 days 
range  between  10-13  mm,  and  were  statistically  significant  between  48  hours  and  6  days  (including  72 
hours, the timepoint of the co-primary objective). Summary statistics of pain intensity in first 7 days and all 
scheduled  visits  over  24  weeks  were  provided  showing  also  a  fast  onset  in  patients  treated  with 
canakinumab with absolute and relative improvement in pain intensity of 16.7mm, 23.2mm and 31.8mm, or 
>20%, >30% and >40% compared to baseline (74.6mm) after 6, 12 and 24 hours.

who were on ULT, or failed ULT or were contraindicated to ULT, by treatment (Full 
analysis set); n=101 
In addition to this acute pain management benefit, the superiority in time to first new flare was maintained 
over  12  (co-primary  endpoint)  and  24  weeks,  with  a  median  time  to  first  new  flare  of  155  days  for 
triamcinolone acetonide, while the median time to first new flare for the canakinumab arm could not be 
estimated (see table below) as only 27% of canakinumab-treated patients flared in first 24 weeks.

on ULT, or failed or were contraindicated to ULT, by treatment (Full analysis set) 
Similarly to the overall study population, patients with a good pain response (≥50% pain reduction after 
treatment of the baseline flare), had fewer flares over 12 and 24 weeks, compared to those with a poor pain 
response. Again, these results support the postulate that a good pain response appears to correlate with an 
increased interval between subsequent clinical flares. 
There  was  maintained  efficacy  on  re-treatment  as  evidenced  by  the  pain  reductions  over  first  7  days 
following treatment which were comparable for baseline flare and last post-baseline flare. 
In summary efficacy in patients receiving ULT, who have failed ULT, or for whom ULT is contraindicated, and 
who are unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine was similar to overall study results, showing maintenance of 
the improved response for both co-primary endpoints; pain and time to next flare over triamcinolone.

Treatment of flares 
Data on pain intensity (0-100mm VAS) over the first 7 days is presented in the table below. At all time points 
reported there was a numerical advantage favoring canakinumab over triamcinolone acetonide reflected by 
the point estimate. At early time points pain is numerically in favor of canakinumab with a 3mm benefit after 
6 & 12 hours and increases to 6.7mm after 24 hours. Estimated differences in pain intensity between 48 
hours and 7 days range between 10-13 mm, and were statistically significant between 48 hours and 6 days 
(including  72  hours,  the  time  point  at  which  the  co-primary  objective  was  assessed).  These  data  also 
demonstrate a fast onset of action in patients treated with canakinumab with absolute improvement in pain 
intensity compared to baseline of 16.7mm, 23.2mm and 31.8mm after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. As 
a relative improvement this corresponds to >20% (slightly improved patient-perceived pain according to 
pain transition scale), >30% and >40% (much improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition 
scale) compared to baseline (74.6mm) after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively.

Delay of subsequent flares 
In addition to the acute pain management benefit, the superiority in “time to first new flare” was maintained 
over 12 (co-primary endpoint) and 24 weeks, with fewer canakinumab patients experiencing a new flare. For 
triamcinolone acetonide, the median time to first new flare was 155 days. However, the median time to “first 
new flare” for the canakinumab arm could not be estimated as only 27% of canakinumab-treated patients 
flared in the first 24 weeks (see table below).

Treatment of flares 
Data on pain intensity (0-100mm VAS) over the first 7 days is presented in this narrower ULT subgroup 
(excluding  patients  failed  or  contraindicated  to  ULT),  in  the  table.  The  effect  on  pain  intensity  was 
numerically in favor of canakinumab for all time points from 12 hours onwards. From 24 hours onwards 
estimated differences compared to triamcinolone acetonide were ranging between 3 and 8mm benefit in 
favor of canakinumab. As expected, confidence interval width in this small group is large due to variance. 
Since the confidence intervals include the point estimates of the analyses from the larger ULT subgroup 
below, as well as the overall study population, results from this newly requested narrow ULT subgroup are 
in line with earlier results. 
Further,  changes  from  baseline  show  a  fast  onset  of  action  in  patients  treated  with  canakinumab  with 
absolute  improvement  in  pain  intensity  compared  to  baseline  of  15.3mm,  24.5mm  and  29.9mm,  or  a 
relative improvement of >20% (slightly improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale), 
>30% and >40% (much improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition scale) compared to 
baseline  (72.3mm)  after  6,  12  and  24  hours,  respectively  (Salaffi  et  al,  2004).  Further,  a  ≥20% 
improvement in pain (after 24 hours)  has been suggested recently to define an appropriate response in 
gouty  arthritis  attacks  (Khanna  D,  2011).  This  onset  of  action  is  consistent  with  the  one  shown  for  the 
subgroup presented later, i.e. ‘Patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine; ULT (use/failure/CI)’.

Delay of subsequent flares 
Background: When interpreting data on delay of subsequent flares, it is important to keep in mind that the 
phase  3  protocols  required  patients  to  be  on  a  stable  dose  of  urate  lowering  therapy  (ULT)  (Inclusion 
criterion: “If on ULT (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticase, probenecid), stable dose and schedule with 
no changes in therapy for 2 weeks prior to randomization and expected to remain on a stable regimen during 
study  participation”).  This  requirement  was  introduced  to  minimize  any  bias  that  might  be  related  to  a 
potential high number of incident flares due to adjustment of ULT. 
In  the  narrower  ULT  subgroup  limited  to  current  users  of  ULT  (i.e.  excluding  patients  who  failed  or  are 
contraindicated to ULT), analysis of time to first new flare and corresponding hazard ratios do not suggest a 
difference of either treatment option, neither at 12 or 24 weeks (see table below). 
Based on descriptive results of the Kaplan Meier estimates there was no differentiation over the first 12 
weeks, with 21% of canakinumab patients and 20% of triamcinolone acetonide patients having a new flare. 
However, over 24 weeks there was a slight trend toward reduced incidence of new flares for canakinumab 
patients (38%), compared to triamcinolone acetonide patients (44%) (see table below). 
Table 46.  Time to first new flare in patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine; ULT (current 
user) 
Additionally, although patient numbers and differences were small, fewer canakinumab patients compared 
to triamcinolone acetonide patients had maximum number of new flares observed in 12 and 24 weeks (1 vs. 
2 patients with a 2nd flare in 12 weeks, and also 1 vs. 2 patients with a 3rd flare in 24 weeks). Moreover, the 
mean flare rate over 12 and 24 weeks also slightly favored canakinumab (see table below).

Supportive studies 
Extension studies H2356E1 and H2357E1 
Studies H2356E1 and H2357E1 were an active controlled extension phase of the main pivotal studies H2356 
and H2357 respectively. 
After the pivotal trial, patients were continued in a 12 week double blind, controlled extension, receiving the 
same, on-demand treatment as in the core study. The primay objective of these two extension studies was 
to assess safety and tolerability. All efficacy endpoints were secondary objectives. 
Time to new flare (24 weeks) 
Time to new flare, which is the co-primary endpoint at 12 weeks, is  shown for the 12 week period plus 
extensions in the table below (24 weeks total) to evaluate the durability of effect. As in the core trials the 
cumulative flare rates and the risk of a new flare were considerably reduced and statistically significantly 
lower with canakinumab than with triamcinolone acetonide. The median times to new flare were 119 and 
146 days with triamcinolone acetonide in both trials, and >168 days (trial duration) with canakinumab, as 
evident from the table below. 
The 52% and 60% risk reductions over 24 weeks (hazard ratios of 0.48 and 0.40) are clinically significant, 
as indicated by the lower median time to the first new flare with triamcinolone acetonide (131 days), than 
with canakinumab (>168 days). Although the median time to new flare is unclear until 50% of patients have 
flared, it may be several months longer with canakinumab than with triamcinolone acetonide. 
Table 48.  Time to new flare/probability of flare (24 weeks) 
The frequency of new flares (24 weeks) 
The rate of new flares, and the mean number of flares per patient, is shown for the pivotal trials plus their 
extensions in the table below. As in the core 12 week period, more patients were free of new flares with 
canakinumab than triamcinolone acetonide (68% versus 49% and 75% versus 54%), fewer patients had 2 
or more new flares (8% versus 22% and 7% versus 22%) and the mean number of flares per patient was 
lower (0.4 versus 0.9 and 0.4 versus 0.8). Thus, with canakinumab more patients were free of new flares 
and, in addition, less patients experienced multiple new flares.

Table 49.  Rate if new flares, mean flares per patient (24 weeks) 
Efficacy upon re-treatment (24 weeks) 
Efficacy  upon  re-treatment  for  new  flares  in  the  24  week  period  was  also  evaluated.  This  increases  the 
number of patients who are included to 60 with canakinumab and to 89 with triamcinolone acetonide (>50% 
more than in the 12 week period), thereby providing more data on the effect of re-treatment on pain relief. 
The methodological reasons that hinder direct treatment comparisons in patients with new flares are briefly 
described. Re-treatment efficacy is then assessed by comparing the first flare with the last flare, to avoid the 
bias in direct treatment comparisons. For completeness, the use of rescue medication and the subgroup 
analyses are also presented, despite the limitations regarding treatment comparisons. 
Constraints of treatment comparisons for new flares 
Methodological reasons hinder direct treatment comparisons of efficacy in the subgroup of patients with new 
flares,  as  re-treatment  was  not  randomly  allocated  (the  initial  treatment  was  repeated),  so  results  are 
subject to a selection bias from the first treatment. The lack of random allocation after the first treatment is 
likely to lead to unequal distributions of participation and disease severity across re-treatment groups. 
Unequal participation arose from both a lower proportion of patients who had new flares with canakinumab 
(28%, 64/225) than triamcinolone acetonide (49%, 112/229), (see table above), and a lower proportion of 
re-treatment data with triamcinolone acetonide than canakinumab (79%, 89/112 versus 94%, 60/64). The 
latter resulted mainly from the early occurrence of new flares (the protocol prohibited re-treatment within 14 
days  of  the  last  dose),  also  from  eligible  patients  not  returning  for  re-treatment  and  occasionally  from 
missing data. 
An imbalance in disease severity of re-treated canakinumab patients is seen in the key disease and flare 
features in the table below. Patients had more severe disease (less monoarticular and more polyarticular 
gouty  arthritis,  greater  presence  of  tophi,  history  of  >6  flares/year  and  higher  disability  indices).  Their 
current flare was also more severe (less involvement of ≤2 joints and more involvement of ≥4 joints). The 
imbalance  is  likely  related  to  the  different  rates  of  new  flare  (72%  on  canakinumab  and  51%  on 
triamcinolone acetonide had no new flare).

Patient Assessment (VAS first and last flare) 
With canakinumab the mean VAS pain treatment response of the last flare was very similar to that of the first 
flare in all patients with re-treatment (see figure below). However, for the last flare, in the pooled dataset, 
baseline VAS pain was less than that for the first flare (66 mm versus 75 mm) with canakinumab but quite 
similar with triamcinolone acetonide (72 mm versus 75 mm) suggesting that the pain intensity at the start 
of a new flare had been reduced by prior canakinumab treatment. The data from each study was consistent 
with the pooled analysis.

VAS pain (mm) over time (first and last flare) in re-treated canakinumab patients 
(pooled 24 week data) 
Pain reduction of at least 50% (first and last flare) 
The  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  50%  reduction  in  VAS  pain  by  day  7  with  the  initial  treatment 
relative to the last treatment, and of those with a less than 50% reduction in VAS pain are shown in the table 
below. 
With canakinumab, a strong response to treatment (≥50% reduction in VAS pain) predicted strong response 
to re-treatment (84%), and weak response to treatment (<50% reduction in VAS pain) predicted a weak 
response to re-treatment (77%). Thus, both a weak response after a good one and a good response after a 
weak one were relatively uncommon (16% and 23%).

However,  with  triamcinolone  acetonide,  although  a  good  response  to  initial  treatment  predicted  a  good 
response to re-treatment (89%), a weak response to initial treatment did not predict a weak response to 
re-treatment (44%). A weak response after a strong one was unlikely (11%), but a strong response after a 
weak one was quite common (56%). 
Table 51.  Predictability of VAS pain relief (first and last flare) 
Pain, global assessment, swelling, tenderness (first and last flare) 
The maintenance of efficacy with re-treatment for new flares is also confirmed in the scores for Likert pain, 
patient and physician global assessments of response, physician assessment of joint tenderness and joint 
swelling at 72 hours and 7 days. Canakinumab treatment showed similar levels of response during the last 
flare compared to the baseline flare at both timepoints, demonstrating that efficacy is preserved in new 
flares. 
Table 52.  Pain, global assessments, tender/swollen joints (first and last flare) 
Rescue medication use (last flare) 
The  use of rescue medication was evaluated from the time to first intake, the  number of patients using 
rescue medication, and the amount of rescue medication taken during the last flare. Treatment comparisons 
can only indicate trends, as the treatment groups are exposed to selection bias from the first treatment. 
The  proportions  of  patients  using  any  rescue  medication  or  each  type  of  rescue  medication  showed  no 
consistent  treatment  difference  during  the  last  flare.  However,  the  amount  of  corticosteroid  rescue 
medication  taken  (mean  total  in  mg)  was  consistently  less  with  canakinumab  than  with  triamcinolone 
acetonide,  with  the  amounts  of  acetaminophen/paracetamol  or  codeine  used  showing  no  consistent 
difference. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 69/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Thus, in the extension studies, for the last flare in patients using canakinumab, the use of corticosteroids 
continued to be reduced, suggesting that there was both less pain and less inflammation with canakinumab, 
which is supported by the finding of reduced pain for the new flare in the canakinumab group. 
Table 53.  Mean amount of rescue medication taken for last flare (24 weeks) 
Duration of flare (first and last flare) 
With canakinumab the mean (median) duration of the new flare compared to the baseline flare seemed to be 
reduced in Study H2356E1 and possibly in Study H2357E1, whereas with triamcinolone acetonide, mean 
(median) durations for the new flare showed no signs of being reduced. 
Table 54.  Mean/median duration of flare (first and last flare) 
Subgroups of the study population (24 weeks) 
Subgroup analyses were used to demonstrate that efficacy persists in common subgroups of the overall 
population at the 24 week timepoint. 
The results of the subgroup analyses at 24 weeks showed no qualitative differences from those at 12 weeks 
for time to first new flare and VAS pain intensity, and no loss of efficacy over time. There were no differences 
in efficacy at 24 weeks compared to the overall study population among demographic subgroups (age, sex, 
race, BMI), except that there were too few Asians to show a treatment difference. 
There were also similar trends in efficacy at 24 weeks compared to the overall population in 1) patients 
documented as unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, 2) patients with ≥6 flares in the previous year, 3) 
patients  unable  to  use  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  and  with  ≥6  flares  in  the  previous  year,  or  4)  use  of 
urate-lowering drugs, as shown in the tables below for the analysis of time to first new flare.

Table 55.  Time to first new flare in disease-related subgroups over time 
Patients with ≥6 flares in the previous year showed smaller treatment effects at 24 weeks than at 12 weeks, 
narrowly missing statistical significance for time to first new flare (p=0.034). This suggests that beyond 12 
weeks from initial treatment, when canakinumab exposure is probably low, frequently-flaring patients start 
to resume a high flare rate. These patients have a shorter median time to next flare (close to 24 weeks, as 
almost 50% had flared, see table above) than the overall population (32% had flared at 24 weeks), and are 
likely to need more frequent treatment. 
A further analysis of time to first new flare in the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine 
and with ≥6 new flares in the previous year showed a statistically significant lower relative risk of a new flare 
in canakinumab-treated patients compared to triamcinolone acetonide at both 12 weeks (p=0.0116) and 24 
weeks (p=0.0242) despite the small sample size (Table 30-9). Median time to first new flare was 96 days in 
the triamcinolone acetonide group and not estimable in the canakinumab group as <50% of patients had a 
new flare by 24 weeks. 
Patients  on  urate-lowering  drugs,  who  showed  a  27%  relative  risk  reduction  of  a  new  flare  (HR  0.73, 
p=0.1492) in favor of canakinumab at 12 weeks (see table above), also showed a larger (36%) relative risk 
reduction at 24 weeks narrowly missing statistical significance (p=0.0337), as shown in the table below. At 
both timepoints, the lesser benefit than seen in the overall population was due to a decrease in flare rates 
with triamcinolone acetonide, rather than a rise with canakinumab.

For patients on urate lowering drugs, the reduction in VAS pain after treatment for the first (baseline) flare 
was statistically greater for canakinumab than triamcinolone acetonide at 24, 48, 72 hours, 4, 5 and 6 days 
post-dose (p≤0.018), with the difference in least squares means (LSMs) in favor of canakinumab ranging 
from a maximum of 9.1 mm at 48 hours to 7.5 mm at 6 days post-dose. For patients not on urate lowering 
drugs, the reduction in VAS pain was also statistically greater for canakinumab than triamcinolone acetonide 
at  these  timepoints  and  also  at  7  days  post-dose  (p≤0.004),  with  the  difference  in  LSMs  in  favor  of 
canakinumab ranging from 12.6 mm at 72 hours to 8.4 mm at 7 days post-dose (>10 mm LSM difference at 
48h, 72h, 4 and 6 days post-dose). 
For  patients  who  were  unable  to  use  NSAIDs  and  colchicine,  comparison  of  LSMs  of  VAS  pain  after  the 
baseline attack showed a >10 mm difference in favor of canakinumab versus triamcinolone acetonide from 
48  hours  to  6  days  post-dose  with  statistical  significance  observed  from  24  hours  to  7  days  post-dose 
(p≤0.0185). 
In the small subgroup of patients who were unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine and had ≥6 flares in the 
previous year, comparison of LSMs during the baseline attack show a >10 mm VAS pain difference in favor 
of  canakinumab  versus  triamcinolone  acetonide  from  48  hours  to  7  days  post-dose  with  statistical 
significance observed from 72 hours to 6 days post-dose (p≤0.0173).

1.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
Two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  were  performed  in  gouty  arthritis  patients  investigating  canakinumab  for 
superiority over the active comparator triamcinolone (studies H2356 & H2357). The dose finding study was 
conducted in an appropriate way and the results support the use of 150 mg canakinumab in the pivotal 
studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 72/136 
 
 
 
  
 
Use of systemic steroids as the active comparator in this population is generally considered acceptable. The 
CHMP  noted  that  the  employed  dose  of  the  comparator  triamcinolone  acetonide  (40  mg  i.m.)  –  also 
compared to standard therapy - is debatable and that triamcinolone acetonide is a slow release product with 
a delayed clinical efficacy. However, it is acknowledged that there is no sufficient evidence that another 
comparator would have been more appropriate and the comparator used was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP for this study program. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the two pivotal trials defined a patient population with a progressed 
disease level. Patients who had contraindication, intolerance or lack of efficacy for NSAID and/or colchicine 
were  included.  The  CHMP  noted  that  since  both  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  are  considered  standard  of  care 
therapy  in  most  European  countries,  65%  of  the  included  patients  had  a  remaining  treatment  option. 
Furthermore, for the criteria of contraindications also relative contraindications were allowed. 
The primary and secondary objectives are deemed adequate to assess the efficacy of canakinumab for the 
treatment  of  gouty  arthritis  and  the  chosen  efficacy  assessment  instruments  represent  the  currently 
available and validated portfolio. 
Demographic and background characteristics were generally comparable between the treatment groups. 
The mean BMI was high as well as the mean body weight, as expected in this disease and population. The 
CHMP  noted  that  there  were  limited  data  in  female  patients  and  patients  >75  years  considering  the 
prevalence of gout in the general population. 
There were some imbalances in study H2356 between the treatment groups. The canakinumab group had a 
lower proportion of patients with a > 10 year history of gout and with > 6 flares but a higher proportion of 
polyarticular gout compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group. The MAH provided a subgroup analysis 
of patients with a > 10 year history of gout and with > 6 flares in the previous year. Results of the two 
co-primary  endpoints  were  provided  by  the  MAH  and  there  was  no  statistically  significant  superiority  of 
canakinumab treatment but in all evaluations a trend for a better response to canakinumab was shown. The 
MAH attributed this reduced rate of efficacy to the small size of the chose subpopulation (n = 55) which was 
supported by the CHMP.  
Only 42.3% of all assessed patients in the pivotal studies received a causal therapy with urate lowering 
therapeutics, mostly allopurinol. In study H2357 slightly more patients in the canakinumab group were not 
on  urate  lowering  therapeutics  during  the  study  compared  to  the  triamcinolone  group  (71.4%  versus 
64.9%) potentially favouring the efficacy in the canakinumab group. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
The primary analysis in the overall population (full analysis set) shows that in both phase III studies the two 
co-primary endpoints were met with statistical significance. The first co-primary endpoint investigating pain 
reduction at 72 hours post-dose was met with a statistically significant superior treatment effect of ~10mm 
on the VAS scale for the canakinumab treatment group compared with the triamcinolone acetonide group 
(H2356: -11.4mm, p=0.0005; H2357: -9.8mm, p=0.0018). 
The second co-primary endpoint “time to first new gout flare”, presented as the probability of having a new 
flare, was met with a statistically significant risk reduction for time to first new gout flare (H2356: HR 0.45, 
p=0.0014; H2357: HR 0.32, p<0.0001).  
Looking at the subgroup of patients on urate lowering therapy, relatively lower efficacy was seen for pain 
relief  and  no  statistical  superior  delay  of  subsequent  flares  was  demonstrated.  The  deposition  of  urate 
crystals  is  the  primary  cause  of  gout;  therefore,  treatment  with  appropriate  urate  lowering  therapy  is 
considered the primary and causal therapy. The CHMP noted however that only 42% of study population was 
on urate lowering therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 73/136 
 
 
  
 
The  four  key  secondary  endpoints  in  both  studies  were  proportion  of  patients  taking  rescue  medication 
during  the  first  week;  Time  to  50%  reduction  of  baseline  pain  intensity  in  the most  affected  joint  (on  a 
0-100mm  VAS);  Time  to  complete  resolution  of  pain  in  the  most  affected  joint  (pain  intensity  on  Likert 
=none); and SF-36 physical function component score at end of study. In study H2356 only two of these four 
secondary endpoints adjusted for multiplicity were statistically significant and in study H2357 none of these 
endpoints showed a statistically significant superiority of canakinumab treatment. For the other secondary 
endpoints,  in  study  H2357  the  other  secondary  endpoints  showed  statistically  significant  superiority  of 
canakinumab treatment to triamcinolone acetonide except for the physician’s assessment of erythema. In 
study H2356 patient’s assessment of pain as well as patient’s and physician’s global assessment of response 
and evaluation of rescue medication intake showed benefits in favour of the treatment with canakinumab. 
From 12 to 24 hours onwards a small difference in better pain reduction was shown. In the canakinumab 
treatment group pain was reduced a bit earlier and to a slightly higher extent, but this is not leading to an 
obvious difference in definite pain reduction. In study H2356 median hsCRP and SAA protein levels were 
lower (and below ULN) in the canakinumab treatment group compared with the triamcinolone treatment 
group, where they were slightly above or upon the ULN-borderline. Remarkably, this effect was enduring 
until 84 days post-dose. However, assessment of CRP and SAA levels are possibly biased by a great amount 
of missing data/values, and are therefore not fully evaluable. 
Based on this primary analysis for the overall population, the CHMP raised during the assessment concerns 
regarding the clinical benefit of canakinumab compared to triamcinolone in the initially claimed population. 
Taking into account that 65% of the patients could have been also treated with another standard treatment 
the clinical meaningfulness of the statistically significant results in the population of patients failing standard 
of care treatment was considered not demonstrated. 
In order to address the CHMP’s concerns, the MAH proposed to restrict the indication to the symptomatic 
treatment  of  patients  with  frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  in  whom  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  are 
contraindicated,  not  tolerated  or  ineffective  and  which  whom  cannot  take  repeated  courses  of 
corticosteroids. To support the benefit/risk profile of Ilaris in the new restricted indication, the MAH provided 
during the evaluation a number of subgroup analyses in patients unable to use neither NSAID nor colchicine. 
Efficacy results in a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on ULT, 
failed ULT or had a contraindication to ULT (N=101) were consistent with the overall study population with 
a  statistically  significant  difference  compared  to  triamcinolone  acetonide  in  pain  intensity  at  72 hours 
(-10.2 mm,  p=0.0208)  and  in  reduction  of  risk  of  subsequent  attacks  (Hazard  ratio  0.39,  p=0.0047  at 
24 weeks). Efficacy results for a more stringent subgroup limited to current users of ULT (N=62) suggested 
a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent attacks, although the observed treatment effect was 
comparable  to  triamcinolone  acetonide  and  neither  of  the  two  co-primary  endpoints  achieved  statistical 
significance.  In  the  pooled  data  set  the  pain  reduction  at  72  h  showed  a  mean  difference  versus 
triamcinolone  of  -  3.8  (p=0,2798)  and  the  reduction  in  frequency  of  new  flares  a Hazard  ration  of  0.91 
(p=0,4166 at 24 weeks). It needs to be noted though that these post-hoc subgroup analysis are based on 
a  very  low  number  of  patients  (n=101  and  n=62,  respectively).  The  CHMP,  taking  into  account  the 
demonstrated efficacy of canakinumab for the treatment of symptomatic pain relief in gouty arthritis as well 
as the unmet need in a severely ill patient population without available treatment options, considered the 
evidence base sufficient to conclude on a clinical meaningfulness of the use in these patients.   
The  MAH  initially  proposed  a  single  dose  of  150  mg  of  canakinumab  with  possible  re-treatment  after  a 
minimum of 14 days. However the CHMP questioned the proposed re-treatment interval on the basis that it 
was  not  studied  in  the  clinical  program  supporting  this  extension  of  indication.  The  MAH  consequently 
proposed as a new re-treatment interval a minimum of 12 weeks and supported this through adequate data, 
which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

In the 24 week extension studies H2356E1 and H2357E1, in the overall population, canakinumab treatment 
showed a statistically significant reduced probability of re-flare. Time to re-flare could not be estimated due 
to the low rate of re-flares. These results are not statistically significant in the small subgroup of patients on 
urate lowering therapy. The presented data show that the treatment effect of canakinumab is not decreasing 
for  a  re-flare  over  time  if  the  efficacy  in  new  flare  is  directly  compared  to  baseline  flare.  Compared  to 
triamcinolone canakinumab showed a trend for a better efficacy in treatment of subsequent flares, but a 
statistically significant difference between the two treatments was not shown. 
1.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In  the  two  pivotal  studies  H2356  and  H2357,  the  first  co-primary  endpoint  was  met  with  a  statistically 
significant pain reduction at 72 hours post-dose for the canakinumab treatment group compared with the 
triamcinolone acetonide group. The second co-primary endpoint “time to first new gout flare”, presented as 
the probability of having a new flare, was met with a significant risk reduction for time to first new gout flare. 
Both co-primary endpoints were met in favour of the canakinumab overall treatment group. However, since 
in  the  subgroup  of  patients  on  urate  lowering  therapy,  the  difference  between  the  canakinumab  and 
triamcinolone  treatment  was  no  longer  statistically  significant  for  both  co-primary  endpoints  the  CHMP 
questioned  the  clinical  meaningfulness  in  a  population  that  could  have  been  also  treated  with  another 
standard treatment. The restriction of the indication to a last line treatment options was therefore deemed 
necessary.  Considering  that  canakinumab  demonstrated  its  efficacy  in  symptomatic  pain  relief  and 
considering  that  there  is  a  very  small  population  of  severe  gouty  arthritis  patients  with  a  long  standing 
disease, multiple co-morbidities and a lack of available treatment options, treatment with canakinumab is 
seen as an option for the symptomatic treatment of a subpopulation of adults patients with frequent gouty 
arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous  12 months) in whom  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are  contraindicated,  are  not  tolerated,  or  do  not  provide  an  adequate 
response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.  
1.7.  Clinical safety 
The safety data comes from 3 main sources, active controlled studies from patients with gouty arthritis, and 
placebo-controlled and uncontrolled trials from a discontinued indication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The clinical safety data (cut-off date 22-Sep-2010) presented consist of patient experience in over 3450 
patients in 39 clinical studies, approximately 2500 of  whom received canakinumab. In the pooled gouty 
arthritis  dataset,  1085  patients  were  treated,  with  691  (171.9  patient  years  of  observation)  exposed  to 
canakinumab, mostly using on-demand dosing. In the pooled RA datasets, 478 patients were treated (465 
in placebo-controlled RA dataset plus 13 from study A2206), and 441 (461.2 patient years) were exposed to 
canakinumab, given at fixed dosing intervals 
Safety in the previously-approved orphan indication of CAPS is not presented here, as these small, mainly 
uncontrolled studies have been a part of a prior submission and are considered not relevant for the gouty 
arthritis population given the differences in disease characteristics and demographics of the two populations. 
Patient exposure 
The safety population in each clinical study was defined as all randomized patients who received ≥1 dose of 
study drug with ≥1 post-baseline safety assessment. Studies similar in design, duration or indication were 
pooled to maximize the information for assessing safety. 
There were 3 main pooled datasets, 1 in gouty arthritis and 2 in RA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 75/136 
 
 
  
 
The  gouty  arthritis  safety  population  contains  4  double  or  single-blind,  active-controlled  studies.  The 
demographics of the dataset show the known prevalence of male, middle-aged patients.  
The placebo-controlled RA dataset contains 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and the all RA dataset 
contains 8 controlled and uncontrolled studies. Patient demographics demonstrate the known prevalence of 
female, middle aged, slightly overweight patients. 
Exposure in gouty arthritis is shown in the table below. The full dataset included 1085 patients, 691 on 
canakinumab, with most patients exposed for ≥6 weeks and many for ≥12 weeks. The greatest exposure 
was to ≤100 mg canakinumab (278, 66.3 patient years), 150 mg canakinumab (253, 56.9 patient years), 
and triamcinolone acetonide (286, 61.0 patient years). 
Exposure in the placebo-controlled RA dataset comprised 465 patients, 344 on canakinumab, with most 
patients  exposed  for  ≥12  weeks.  The  greatest  exposure  was  to  150  mg  canakinumab  (69,  15.8  patient 
years), >150 mg canakinumab (263, 96.5 patient years) and placebo (121, 40.6 patient years). 
Exposure in the all RA dataset comprised 441 patients (461.2 patient years) with 255 patients exposed for 
>48 weeks, all patients taking canakinumab.

Adverse events  
All AEs regardless of relationship to study drug were collected by the investigators and recorded on the AE 
CRF with their severity, suspected relationship to study drug according to the investigator, and action taken. 
AEs  were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 13.0), 
which specifies the primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each event. 
Standard summaries of common AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug are provided 
below for the 3 pooled datasets, as well as summaries of special subsets of AEs used to assess potential risks 
relevant to canakinumab. 
The  most  frequently  affected  primary  SOCs  in  the  gouty  arthritis  and  RA  datasets  were  infections  and 
infestations and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders.

In the canakinumab 150 mg group of the gouty arthritis dataset, all types of AEs affected ≤4.0% of patients; 
the most frequent AEs (≥3.0% of patients) were headache (4.0%, 10 patients), hypertension (4.0%, 10 
patients) and back pain (3.6%, 9 patients)—Preferred terms. 
Common AEs and affected SOCs in gouty arthritis dataset 
The frequencies of patients with treatment emergent AEs by primary SOC and common AEs by preferred 
term in the gouty arthritis dataset of active-controlled studies are shown in the two tables below.

Common AEs and affected SOCs in placebo-controlled RA dataset 
Due to the small sample size of the canakinumab <150 mg group (N = 12), this treatment group does not 
provide  meaningful  data  in  comparison  with  the  other  groups  in  the  placebo  controlled  RA  dataset. 
Therefore, in the text tables summarizing the incidence of AEs for the placebo-controlled RA dataset, the 
canakinumab (ACZ885) <150 mg group is not displayed, but it is shown in the source post-text tables. 
Frequencies of patients with treatment emergent AEs by primary SOC and incidence of common AEs by 
preferred term with a cut-off (≥3% of patients in canakinumab 150 mg, >150 mg or placebo groups) in the

Common AEs and affected SOCs in all RA dataset 
The doses of canakinumab in the ACZ885 overall group varied widely which lists the canakinumab groups in 
the 8 studies included in the all RA dataset. 
Frequencies of patients with treatment emergent AEs by primary SOC and incidence of common AEs by 
preferred term with a cut-off (≥3% of patients in ACZ885 overall group) in the all RA dataset are shown by 
24 or 48 week time periods in Table 2-5 and Table 2-6, respectively.  
Primary SOCs in which more than 20% of patients in the ACZ885 overall group had AEs included infections 
and  infestations  (primarily  nasopharyngitis,  URTI,  UTI  and  bronchitis),  musculoskeletal  and  connective 
tissue disorders (primarily (worsening of) RA, arthralgia and back pain), gastrointestinal disorders (primarily 
nausea  and  diarrhea),  nervous  system  disorders  (primarily  headache)  and  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (primarily fatigue, cough and peripheral edema). Vascular disorders (primarily 
hypertension) occurred in 10.7% of patients in the ACZ885 overall group. Over time, the proportions of 
ACZ885 patients with the commonly occurring AEs decreased, the highest rates occurring in the first 24 
week period (Table 2-6).

AEs suspected to be study drug-related in gouty arthritis dataset 
The frequencies of patients with common AEs suspected to be related to study drug (≥1.0% of patients in 
any group, investigator’s assessment) in the gouty arthritis dataset of active controlled studies are shown in 
the table below. 
Overall, 10.1 to 13.1% of patients in the canakinumab groups (excluding the small ACZ885 split 150 mg 
group) had AEs suspected by the investigators to be study drug-related compared to 8.0% on triamcinolone 
acetonide and 10.2% on colchicine. Each type of these AEs occurred at a rate of <2.0% of patients in each 
treatment group, except diarrhea in 2.8% of patients in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group.

AEs suspected to be study drug-related in placebo-controlled RA dataset 
The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug  was  comparable  between  the 
canakinumab >150 mg (26.6%) and placebo (27.3%) groups, with a lower rate in the canakinumab 150 mg 
group (15.9%). In the canakinumab <150 mg group, 9/12 patients were reported to have suspected study 
drug-related AEs. 
Suspected study drug-related AEs of headache, dizziness and vertigo were slightly more common in the 
canakinumab  >150  mg  group  than  in  the  canakinumab  150  mg  and  placebo  groups.  Suspected  study 
drug-related  AEs  including  diarrhea,  nausea,  fatigue  and  alopecia  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the 
placebo group than either of the canakinumab 150 mg or >150 mg groups.

Severity of AEs in gouty arthritis dataset 
Common  AEs  (≥5.0%  of  patients  in  any  group,  regardless  of  severity)  are  summarized  by  maximum 
severity in the gouty arthritis dataset of active-controlled studies in the table below.  
The distribution of AEs by maximum severity was similar across the canakinumab and comparator treatment 
groups with the majority of patients having their most severe AE graded as mild (24.5 to 30.8% of patients, 
discounting the small ACZ885 split 150 mg group), or moderate (15.0 to 20.5%), and approximately 3.5% 
to 5.6% of patients had severe AEs. The common AEs were mainly mild or moderate in severity with only 
isolated cases of severe headache and upper respiratory tract infection in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group 
and  one  case  of  severe  hypertension  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group.  Most  types  of  severe  AEs 
occurred in only one patient, with the exception of severe back pain in 2 patients (1 canakinumab ≤100 mg 
and 1 colchicine), severe nephrolithiasis in 2 patients (1 in each of the canakinumab ≤100 mg and 150 mg 
groups), and severe gout in 3 patients (1 canakinumab ≤100 mg and 2 triamcinolone acetonide).

preferred term and maximum severity (gouty arthritis – safety set) 
Subgroup evaluation of AEs in gouty arthritis dataset 
Adverse events were evaluated in subgroups by age, sex, race and BMI in the gouty arthritis dataset. 
Within the limitations of the imbalance in sample size between males and females, there was a trend towards 
a  higher  incidence  of  any  AE  in  females  than  males  in  canakinumab  (except  ≥200  mg)  and  comparator 
groups.  Other  consistent trends  in  the  incidence  of common  AEs  by  sex  or  age  and  treatment  were  not 
apparent,  treatment  comparisons  being  limited  by  the  low  proportions  of  females  and  patients  aged 
≥65-<75 years or ≥75 years. 
The majority of patients were Caucasian, therefore the incidence of AEs in Black, Asian, or other races was 
inconclusive due to the imbalance in sample size by race and treatment.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The rates of SAEs with 150 mg canakinumab were within the range of the placebo control groups but there 
were slightly more infections. 
In gouty arthritis none of the SAEs occurring in the pivotal trials in the target population at the intended 150 
mg canakinumab dose were suspected to be related to study drug, many were associated with previously 
existing conditions and only 1 involved an infection (lower jaw abscess, not thought study drug related)  
Infections were the predominately affected SOC in the 0-24 week period and declined in later periods. 
Clinically significant AEs are those that were serious, led to discontinuations, are viewed as clinically relevant 
for the drug class or are considered as potential risk for the drug. AEs viewed as clinically relevant were 
infections and potential opportunistic infections, leukopenia, vertigo/dizziness, allergy or hypersensitivity, 
severe injection site reactions, malignancy (drug class effects) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (as 
clinical trials were conducted in older patients with frequent co-morbidities). Frequencies of some events 
(e.g.  AE  of  infections  and  infections  reported  as  SAEs  or  leading  to  discontinuation,  or  AEs  of 
vertigo/dizziness)  were  higher  with  doses  above  150  mg  canakinumab  in  both  gouty  arthritis  and  RA 
patients, but events with the intended 150 mg dose were few. Rates of SAEs, safety discontinuations and 
clinically relevant AEs in gouty arthritis are seen in the table below.

Overall,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  SAEs  was  similar  in  the  canakinumab  150  mg,  ≥200  mg  and 
colchicine  groups  at  5.1  –  5.6%,  lower  in  the  canakinumab  ≤100  mg  group  (4.0%)  and  lowest  in  the 
triamcinolone acetonide group (2.4%) apart from the small canakinumab split 150 mg group in which only 
one patient (1.9%) had an SAE. Less than 2.0% of patients experienced an  SAE in each of the primary 
system organ classes and treatment groups. Infections and infestations were the most frequent SAEs across 
the canakinumab groups affecting 0.8 - 1.9% of patients. Cardiac disorders were more frequent SAEs in the 
colchicine (1.9%) and canakinumab 150 mg (1.2%) groups compared with the lower dose and triamcinolone 
acetonide groups in which no patient had a cardiac SAE; 1 patient (0.9%) in the canakinumab ≥200 mg 
group had a cardiac SAE. Nervous system SAEs affected 3 patients in each of the canakinumab 150 mg 
(1.2%) and triamcinolone acetonide groups (1.0%) compared with 2 patients (0.7%) in the canakinumab 
≤100  mg  group  and  none  in  the  other  treatment  groups.  In  each  treatment  group,  single  patients 
experienced each type of SAE, except for the 2 patients with appendicitis in the canakinumab ≤100 mg 
group. 
Potential opportunistic infections in gouty arthritis dataset 
The incidence rates of potential opportunistic infections in the gouty arthritis dataset are summarized by 
HLGT and preferred term in the table below.  
The incidence of any potential opportunistic infection was low in all the treatment groups, although slightly 
higher  in  the  canakinumab  groups  than  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  and  colchicine  groups,  with  the 
exception  of  the  small  canakinumab  split  150  mg  group  in  which  there  were  no  such  infections.  These 
infections were mostly viral infections (predominantly influenza and viral respiratory tract infections) and 
none  were  serious  nor  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  None  of  these  individual  cases  of  potential 
opportunistic infections were identified as confirmed opportunistic infections on clinical evaluation of the 
data available for each patient. 
One patient (H2255-0123-00901, 55 year old male, Caucasian) in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group had 
latent tuberculosis reported on day 4. He had a positive tuberculosis skin test, his chest X-ray was normal, 
and he was treated with isoniazid for tuberculosis prophylaxis. Two patients, 1 (H2356-0139-00002, 60 year 
old  male,  Caucasian)  in  the  canakinumab  150  mg  group  and  1  (H2357-0571-00010,  70  year  old  male, 
Black)  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group,  had  a  positive  tuberculosis  test  on  day  1  and  day  7, 
respectively. 
Both these patients had normal chest X-rays and no treatment was given.

SAEs and discontinuations for SAE and AE reports and relevant AEs in the placebo controlled RA dataset are 
shown in the table below (all groups).

SAEs and discontinuations for SAE and AE reports and relevant AEs in the all RA dataset over successive, 
equal time periods are shown in the table below (all groups). The rates of SAEs (all) or for infections did not 
increase over time. Similarly, discontinuations overall, or for infections showed no evidence of increase over 
time. Of the especially relevant AEs, all, including infections, but excluding extended MACE, decreased over 
time. Thus, regular dosing with canakinumab showed no trend for a rise in serious or clinically relevant AEs 
over time. 
Table 69.  SAEs, discontinuations, clinically relevant AEs (all RA) 
Primary SOCs in which more than 1% of patients in the ACZ885 overall group had SAEs included infections 
and  infestations,  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications and vascular disorders. RA (worsening of RA in 5 patients) and OA 
(4 patients) were the most frequent SAEs, erysipelas SAEs affected 3 patients, and 2 patients each had SAEs 
of  diarrhea,  radiusfracture,  depression,  anemia,  transient  ischemic  attack,  hypertension  and  lung 
adenocarcinoma. 
Over time, the proportions of canakinumab-treated patients with any SAE varied from 6.6% in the first 24 
week period to 3.1% in the last period, >96 to 144 weeks. Infections tended to occur slightly more often in 
the first 24  weeks of treatment: 2.5% of patients compared to 0.8- 2.3% of  patients in longer periods, 
whereas  there  was  a  small  increase  over  time  in  the  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  disorders  (primarily 
(worsening of) RA and osteoarthritis): 0.7% of patients in the first 24 week period versus 1.4-2.9% in the 
subsequent 3 periods (but none in the last 48 week period). Otherwise, the frequencies of SAEs over time 
were unremarkable given the low incidence and decreasing numbers of patients contributing to the longer 
time periods. 
Immunological events 
Overall 8 patients out of 691 patients treated with canakinumab and for whom antibody were investigated 
have developed antibodies against canakinumab. No effect was observed on PK or safety and efficacy.

Table 70.  Anti-canakinumab antibodies by study 
Treatment upon demand in the gouty arthritis population does not seem to represent an increased risk of 
developing antibodies with only one patient out of 99 patients retreated developing an antibody against 
canakinumab. Overall the incidence of antibodies against canakinumab is slightly higher than 1%. It should 
be noted that a new antibody assay is being developed by the MAH to further improve sensitivity. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies in gouty arthritis dataset 
The incidence of malignancies in the gouty arthritis dataset is summarized by SMQ Malignant or unspecified 
tumors (narrow search) and preferred term. 
Only  2  patients  had  a  malignancy,  1  (0.9%)  with  prostate  cancer  in  the  canakinumab  ≥200  mg  group 
[H2251-0010-00002] and 1 (0.9%) with renal cancer in the colchicine group [H2251- 0520-00001]; both 
were reported as SAEs, and the renal cancer was suspected to be related to study drug. The causality was 
adjudicated as “Not related” for the prostate cancer case and “Possible B: Weight of the evidence suggests 
another cause, but the time frame is compatible with a drug relationship.” for the renal cancer case.  
Malignancies in placebo-controlled RA dataset 
The SMQ narrow search for malignant or unspecified tumors in the placebo-controlled RA dataset found only 
one  patient.  Patient  A2101-0001-00007  in  the  canakinumab  >150  mg  group  had  a  non-malignant  skin 
neoplasm reported as a non-serious tumor of the left elbow of moderate severity and not suspected to be 
related to study drug. 
Malignancies in all RA dataset 
The SMQ narrow search for malignant or unspecified tumors in the all RA dataset found a further 7 patients 
in addition to the one patient with a skin neoplasm in the placebo-controlled RA data set. 
For 3 patients, the malignancy was reported as an SAE. For patient [A2201E1-0074-00008] who died due to 
progression  of  metastatic  lung  adenocarcinoma  (not  suspected  to  be  related  to  study  drug,  adjudicated 
causality:  Possible  A);  patient  [A2201E1-0002-00029]  with  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma/squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the skin (suspected to be study drug-related, adjudicated causality: Possible B), and patient 
[A2201E1-0526-00005]  with  lung  adenocarcinoma  (suspected  to  be  study  drug-related,  adjudicated 
causality: Possible A).

The  2  patients  who  had  basal  cell  carcinoma,  [A2201E1-0051-00005]  and  [A2201E1-0053-  00013], 
discontinued study drug due to these events which were reported as mild and not suspected to be related to 
study drug by the investigator; adjudicated causality for both cases was Possible B. These 2 cases were 
reported as non-serious AEs by the investigators and are recorded as non-serious in the clinical database, 
however they were upgraded to serious by Novartis DS&E. 
The  other  2  malignancy-related  events  were  reported  as  worsening  of  thyroid  nodules  (patient 
A2201E1-0052-00001) and monoclonal gammopathy (patient A2201E1-0054-00017), mild to moderate in 
severity, not serious, not suspected to be study drug-related and not adjudicated. 
Vertigo 
Safety considerations that arose from prior experience with canakinumab indicate that vertigo is a potential 
risk for patients treated with canakinumab, therefore these events were identified by searching the pooled 
datasets  for  the  MedDRA  high  level  term  (HLT)  “vertigos  NEC”  and  the  preferred  terms  “vertigo”  and 
“dizziness”. 
Vertigo in gouty arthritis dataset 
The frequency of patients  with either vertigo or dizziness AEs was similar in the canakinumab ≤100 mg 
(1.8%, 5 patients), split 150 mg (1.9%, 1 patient) and 150 mg (2.0%, 5 patients) groups and slightly higher 
in the canakinumab ≥200 mg (3.7%, 4 patients) group versus 0.7% (2 patients) for triamcinolone acetonide 
and 0% for colchicine. Dizziness was more frequent than vertigo. Vertigo AEs were experienced by only 2 
(0.7%) patients in the ≤100 mg group, 1 (0.9%) patient in the ≥200 mg group and 1 (0.3%) patient on 
triamcinolone acetonide versus none in the other treatment groups. 
None of the vertigo or dizziness AEs were reported as severe or serious, or led to discontinuation of study 
drug. 
Five patients had dizziness AEs that were suspected by the investigators to be related to study drug, 1 in the 
canakinumab ≤100 mg group, 2 in the 150 mg group, 1 in the ≥200 mg group, and 1 in the triamcinolone 
acetonide group. 
Vertigo in placebo-controlled RA dataset 
The frequency of patients with either vertigo or dizziness AEs was highest in the placebo group (10.7%, 13 
patients) compared to 2.9% (2 patients) for canakinumab 150 mg and 7.2% (19 patients) for canakinumab 
>150 mg, and 1 of the 12 patients in the canakinumab <150 mg group had dizziness. Dizziness was more 
frequent than vertigo in the placebo group (8.3% vs. 2.5%, 10 vs. 3 patients), whereas the frequencies of 
dizziness and vertigo were similar in the canakinumab 150 mg (1.4%, 1 patient each) and >150 mg (4.2%, 
11 patients and 3.0%, 8 patients, respectively) groups. None of the vertigo or dizziness AEs were reported 
as severe or serious. One patient in the canakinumab >150 mg group [A2204-0501-05629] discontinued 
study drug due to dizziness after suffering 3 episodes between days 1 and 21, each lasting for 2-3 days. 
One patient (1.4%) in the canakinumab 150 mg group, 14 patients (5.3%) in the >150 mg group and 2 
placebo patients (1.7%) had dizziness or vertigo AEs that were suspected to be related to study drug by the 
investigators. 
Vertigo in all RA dataset 
Overall, 30 patients (6.8%) treated with canakinumab in the all RA dataset experienced either dizziness or 
vertigo with similar frequencies, 3.2% (14 patients) with dizziness and 3.6% (16 patients) with vertigo, 
mostly in the first 24 weeks of treatment (dizziness: 3.2%, vertigo 2.9%). In subsequent periods of >24-48 
weeks and >48–72 weeks of treatment, frequencies of patients with these AEs were low (0 - 0.7%, 0 - 2 
patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013

None of the vertigo or dizziness AEs were reported as severe or serious, and, as described above in the 
placebo-controlled RA dataset, only patient [A2204-0501-05629] discontinued study drug due to dizziness 
on day 21. For 18 of the patients with these AEs, 9 (2.0%) for dizziness and 9 (2.0%) for vertigo, the event 
was suspected to be related to study drug by the investigators. 
Deaths 
In completed studies, there were 8 deaths.  
In  gouty  arthritis,  there  were  5  deaths  (3  in  core  studies,  2  in  extensions  studies),  none  of  which  was 
reported as study drug related.  
In the placebo-controlled RA dataset there were no deaths. 
In the all RA dataset, there were 3 deaths (1 after the study observation period), none of which was reported 
as study drug related. No deaths were the direct result of infection or newly-occurring malignancy. 
In ongoing studies, there were 4 deaths (cut-off date 22-Sept-2010).  
In systemic idiopathic juvenile arthritis (SJIA) there were 2 deaths, one suspected as related to study drug. 
In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) there were 2 deaths, both not thought study drug related. 
There were 2 deaths from infections, neither thought study drug related, and there were no malignancies. 
Another 3 deaths, not in clinical studies, are also summarized.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
Notable changes were infrequent with 150 mg canakinumab, and if they arose, were in the range of the 
controls, except for small excesses in the rates of raised bilirubin, potassium or creatinine and in the rates 
of decreased calcium, potassium or GFR, all of which were minor. 
Raised ALT or AST ≥5 x ULN was not seen with 150 mg canakinumab and there were few cases ≥3 x ULN, 
but some cases of raised bilirubin (one accompanying a mild rise in liver enzymes). Raised creatinine or 
decreased GFR was somewhat more common with 150 mg canakinumab than controls but differences were 
small. Raised lipids (small cholesterol rise, larger triglyceride rise), were not clinically relevant.

abnormalities  affected  less  than  10%  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  for  all  parameters  except 
creatinine clearance <75-50% of LLN. Parameters for which there was a 5-10% incidence in at least one of 
the canakinumab groups and the triamcinolone acetonide or colchicine group included bilirubin >ULN, GGT 
>3 x ULN and GFR <50% of normal. Parameters for which there was a >5% incidence in at least one of the 
canakinumab groups and <5% incidence for both active comparators included calcium <LLN and sodium 
≥150 mmol/L.

Changes in Urate levels during treatment 
In the overall population (in patients with values at both, baseline and end of study), the baseline urate 
values  were  above  the  upper  limit  of  normal  for  both  canakinumab  150  mg  (N=253)  and  triamcinolone 
acetonide (N=286) with mean (SD) of 485 (122) μmol/L and 488 (122) μmol/L, respectively (approximately 
8.2 mg/dL (1 mg/dL equals 59.48 μmol/L)). At the recommended canakinumab 150mg dose, at end of study 
there  was  a  mean  (SD)  increase  of  42  (123)  μmol/L  (corresponding  to  approximately  0.7  mg/dL)  as 
compared  to  an  increase  of  7  (110)  μmol/L  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  (corresponding  to 
approximately 0.1mg/dL) at the end of the study. 
This effect observed over 12 weeks was not amplified and somewhat self-limited at 24 weeks with mean 
(SD) increase over baseline in the canakinumab group of 24(127) μmol/L and a decrease of 11(118) μmol/L 
in the triamcinolone group. 
The MAH argues that inflammation has been considered to have a uricosuric effect. During flares urate levels 
decrease  and  a  negative  correlation  between  urate  and  CRP  is  observed  (Urano  et  al  2002).  As  a 
consequence, one hypothesis to explain the difference observed between canakinumab and triamcinolone 
acetonide  is  that  the  increase  in  urate  levels  observed  with  canakinumab  is  due  to  its  superior 
anti-inflammatory effect compared to triamcinolone acetonide. As inflammation is completely suppressed 
with  canakinumab,  the  uricosuric  effect  is  abated  and  therefore,  uric  acid  levels  increase.  Indeed 
triamcinolone acetonide also seems to have such an anti-uricosuric effect but  it is not as potent as that 
observed with canakinumab due to the less potent anti-inflammatory effect. 
The MAH further outlined that it should be noted that in patients starting urate lowering therapy, who are not 
treated for an acute inflammatory event and have less chronic disease with a lower inflammatory burden, 
canakinumab at the same total dose (150 mg) and at doses higher than the recommended one (≥ 200mg) 
showed a decrease in urate levels from baseline to study end comparable to that observed in the colchicine 
group (150 mg canakinumab split group: -105 μmol/L, canakinumab ≥ 200 mg: -135μmol/L, colchicine: 
-137  μmol/L,  corresponding  to  -1.8  to  -2.3  mg/dL) This  supports  the  concept  that  canakinumab  has  no 
direct pharmacodynamic effect on urate levels and that urate lowering therapy can be used effectively with 
canakinumab. 
The effect on urate level was also studied in the subpopulation on urate lowering therapy as compared to 
those patients not on urate lowering therapy, in the pooled analysis from the 2 pivotal studies. Baseline 
urate levels were lower in users of urate lowering therapy with mean (SD) levels of 453 (139) μmol/L (7.6 
mg/dL) in canakinumab (N=89) and 443 (121) μmol/L (7.4 mg/dL) in the triamcinolone acetonide group 
(N=103).  In  those  subjects  not  using  urate  lowering  therapy  the  mean  (SD)  urate  level  was  509  (113) 
μmol/L  (8.6  mg/dL)  in  canakinumab  (N=136)  and  539  (106)  μmol/L  (9.1  mg/dL)  in  the  triamcinolone 
acetonide group (N=126). 
In the patients in the canakinumab treatment group taking urate lowering therapy, urate levels gradually 
increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) increase of 50 (154) μmol/L, equal to approximately 
0.8mg/dL).  In  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  taking  urate  lowering  therapy,  urate  levels  remained 
stable from baseline to end of study (-0.4 (108) μmol/L. 
In patients not taking urate lowering therapy in the canakinumab group, urate levels also increased from 
baseline  to  end  of  study  (mean  (SD)  27  (108)  μmol/L  equal  to  approximately  0.4  mg/dL),  while  in  the 
triamcinolone acetonide group not taking urate lowering therapy, mean (SD) urate again decreased slightly 
from baseline to end of study (-9 (111) μmol/L) equal to approximately 0.1mg/dL).

Page 95/136 
 
 
  
 
The  uricosuric  effect  of  inflammation  is  indirectly  confirmed  by  a  stabilization  of  urate  levels  due  to  the 
potent  anti-inflammatory  effect  of  canakinumab  during  the  baseline  flare  in  patients  on  urate  lowering 
therapy (mean change (SD) 6 (67) μmol/L (0.1 mg/dL) at day 4 and 1 (102) μmol/L (0.0 mg/dL) at day 8) 
or a slight increase in patients not on ULT (mean change (SD) 29 (57) μmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) at day 4 and 38 
(80)  μmol/L  (0.6  mg/dL)  at  day  8).  On  the  contrary  in  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  where  the 
inflammation is less inhibited there is a decrease regardless of urate lowering therapy (mean change (SD) 
-15 (65) μmol/L (-0.3 mg/dL) at day 4 and -11 (91) μmol/L (-0.2 mg/dL) at day 8 in patients on urate 
lowering therapy, and -18 (70) μmol/L (-0.3 mg/dL) at day 4 and -10 (90) μmol/L (0.2 mg/dL) at day 8 in 
patients not on urate lowering therapy). It should be noted that all these differences until days 4 and 8 are 
in the range of 0.0 to 0.3 mg/dL except for the increase observed in the canakinumab group in patients not 
on ULT where the increase is slightly higher and approximately 0.5-0.6mg/dL. 
In summary urate levels should be monitored as per current medical practice as they tend to increase during 
canakinumab treatment probably due to the potent anti-inflammatory effect that counteracts the natural 
uricosuric  effect  of  inflammation.  However,  canakinumab  does  not  affect  the  efficacy  of  urate  lowering 
therapy as shown by the positive effect on urate levels in patients starting urate lowering therapy.  
Clinical chemistry evaluations in the placebo-controlled RA dataset: 
Notable changes were infrequent with 150 mg canakinumab, and, if they arose, were below the rates with 
placebo, except for some cases of low albumin and elevated ALP. 
Raised  ALT  or  AST  ≥3  or  ≥5  x  ULN  did  not  occur  with  150  mg  canakinumab.  Increased  creatinine  or 
decreased GFR was no more frequent with canakinumab 150 mg than placebo. Increased lipids in some 
groups (a small rise in cholesterol or triglycerides) could not be assessed with 150 mg canakinumab, due to 
missing values.  
Clinical chemistry evaluations in the all RA dataset over successive, equal time periods: 
Notable values were generally stable over time up to the >72-96 week period. Exceptions were seen at 
>48-72 weeks, when low albumin and liver enzymes and high or low potassium arose more often, but these 
were not clinically relevant. 
GFR showed increasing low values over time, but the increases in frequency were small. However, creatinine 
did tend to rise over time and, accordingly, GFR tended to fall over time. Increased lipids (seen as a small 
rise in cholesterol or triglycerides over time), were not clinically relevant  
Hematology 
Hematology evaluations in gouty arthritis  
Mean decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were seen with 150 mg canakinumab 
to  a  greater  extent  than  with  the  controls.  Correspondingly,  notable  decreases  in  white  cell,  absolute 
neutrophil and platelet counts were more frequent in this group, as seen in the table below. Low platelet 
counts were very rarely below 100x109 and only one patient reported an artifactual isolated value of 10x109 
(with normal values a few days before and after without any AE). AEs of leukopenia were rare with 150 mg 
canakinumab (3, 1.2%) and equally common with the controls. An association of lowered white cell counts 
with AEs of infections was not found for the 150 mg dose. There were 3 patients with thrombocytopenia AEs, 
1 in each of the canakinumab split 150 mg, 150 mg and colchicine groups, and 4 patients with platelet count 
decreased reported as an AE, 3 in the canakinumab 150 mg group and 1 in the canakinumab ≥200 mg 
group, but these had no clinical consequences. Thus, these changes, which have already been observed with 
canakinumab across patient populations, were not associated with clinical events at the 150 mg dose.

Neutropenia AEs in gouty arthritis dataset 
The potential risk of neutropenia with canakinumab treatment was assessed by using SMQ broad searches 
for “Leukopenia”.  
One (0.4%) patient in the canakinumab ≤100 mg group, 3 (1.2%) patients in the canakinumab 150 mg 
group,  1  (0.9%)  patient  in  the  canakinumab  ≥200  mg  group,  1  (0.3%)  patient  in  the  triamcinolone 
acetonide  group  and  3  (2.8%)  patients  in  the  colchicine  group  experienced  at  least  one  of  the  AEs: 
leucopenia,  neutropenia,  neutrophil  count  decreased  or  WBC  count  abnormal.  For 
the  5 
canakinumab-treated patients, the 8 events were either mild or asymptomatic, and suspected to be related 
to  study  drug.  For  the  single  triamcinolone  acetonide-treated  patient,  the  2  events  were  mild  and  not 
suspected to be related to study drug.  
For the 3 colchicine-treated patients, the 5 events were mild to moderate in severity, suspected to be related 
to study drug for 2 patients and not suspected for the third patient. No action was taken for any of these 
events. Infections in the patients with the above AEs included: 
• 
a mild respiratory tract infection on day 131-135 in patient H2251-0075-00002 (canakinumab ≥200 
mg) who had asymptomatic leucopenia starting on day 85 and continuing, 
Assessment report

Page 97/136 
 
 
 
 
  
 
• 
2  episodes  of  mild  acute  cystitis  on  day  14-57  and  day  146-167  in  patient  H2251-0074-  00008 
(colchicine) who had moderate leucopenia on day 85 – 113. 
Only 1 of the 9 canakinumab-treated patients with serious infections had notably low WBCs (≤0.8 x LLN) or 
absolute neutrophils (≤0.9 x LLN). Patient [H2356-0121-00001] (canakinumab 150 mg, 52 year old male 
Caucasian)  had  jaw  abscess  reported  as  an  SAE  from  day  29-58;  absolute  neutrophils  on  day  28  were 
normal (3.13 x109/L) but were notably low on day 58 (1.5 x109/L) returning to normal by day 86 (2.57 
x109/L). 
Thrombocytopenia AEs in gouty arthritis dataset 
There were 3 patients with thrombocytopenia AEs, 1 in each of the canakinumab split 150 mg, 150 mg and 
colchicine groups, and 4 patients with platelet count decreased reported as an AE, 3 in the canakinumab 150 
mg group and 1 in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group. These events in the canakinumab-treated patients 
were suspected to be related to study drug by the investigators. 
None of these AEs was reported as an SAE or led to discontinuation of study drug. 
None of the patients with serious bleeding disorders had notably low platelets (<LLN). 
Hematology evaluations in the placebo-controlled RA dataset  
Mean decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were seen with 150 mg canakinumab 
to  a  greater  extent  than  with  placeb.  Correspondingly,  notable  decreases  in  white  cell,  and  absolute 
neutrophil counts were more frequent in this group, but notable decreases in platelet counts were absent, as 
seen in the table below. 
AEs of leukopenia were rare with 150 mg canakinumab (1, 1.4%) and not seen with placebo. A potential 
association of lowered white cell counts with an infection was only seen in one patient with an SAE of jaw 
abscess during a concurrent transient notable decrease in absolute neutrophils. An association of lowered 
platelet counts with AEs of bleeding was not found. 
Table 76.  Notable hematology changes (placebo-controlled RA) 
Hematology evaluations in the all RA dataset over successive, equal time periods: 
The mean decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts seen with canakinumab seemed 
stable over time. Thus, notable decreases in white cell, absolute neutrophil and platelet counts were more 
frequent in this dataset as seen in the table below.

Urinalysis 
The results of the urinalysis were unremarkable. 
ECG assessments 
A standard 12-lead ECG was performed at baseline and as specified in the visit schedule of each study to 
assess  cardiovascular  status  and/or  history  at  study  start  and  study  end.  Canakinumab  had  no  cardiac 
effects in pre-clinical studies. 
In  gouty  arthritis,  there  were  few  abnormal  ECGs  and  most  relevant  findings  were  already  present  at 
baseline. New changes were similar across treatments. 
In RA, few relevant ECG changes were detected, most findings were already present at baseline or single 
occurrences that were clinically insignificant. 
Vital signs and physical examinations 
The results of the vital signs and physical examinations were also unremarkable.  
Safety in special populations 
Special  patient  populations  were  only  examined  in  the  target  indication  of  gouty  arthritis.  AEs  were 
evaluated  in  demographic  subgroups  (age,  sex,  race,  BMI),  baseline  comorbidity  subgroups,  and  in  the 
subgroup of patients for whom NSAIDs and colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective. 
For demographic subgroups, there were no consistent or important differences, but women and some racial 
groups were under-represented. In patients with or without contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine there 
were no differences in the rate or distribution of AEs. 
For  patients  with  baseline  co-morbidities,  there  were  greater  improvements  in  blood  pressure  (BP)  in 
hypertensive patients, in lipids and systolic BP in those with metabolic syndrome, in lipids in those  with 
hypercholesterolemia, and in BP and microalbuminuria in those with kidney disease after treatment with 
canakinumab compared to triamcinolone acetonide.

In  the  pooled  gouty  arthritis  studies  H2356  and  H2357,  32/225  (14.2%)  patients  received  at  least  one 
additional dose of canakinumab 150 mg versus 64/229 (27.9%) triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients 
who  received  at least one  additional dose  when  a  new  flare  occurred.  Of  the  32  canakinumab  retreated 
patients, 28 received 1 additional dose for the first new flare (after the initial flare at study entry), 3 received 
a second additional dose when a second new flare occurred, and 1 received a third additional dose upon third 
new flare. Of the 64 triamcinolone acetonide retreated patients, 53 received 1 additional dose for the first 
new flare, and 11 received a second additional dose when a second new flare occurred, none received a third 
additional dose (see table below).

Patients with appropriate management of uricaemia 
These  patients,  unable  to  use  NSAIDs  and  colchicine,  who  were  on  ULT,  failed  ULT  or  where  ULT  was 
contraindicated, included over 100 patients; this provides a reasonable assessment of efficacy and safety in 
this target population. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 66% of canakinumab-treated patients and 
47% of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients who were unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine and who 
were on ULT, failed ULT or in whom ULT was contraindicated. These results were similar to the findings of the 
overall population treated. The observations are consistent with the known increased risk of infections for 
canakinumab  where  20%  (10  patients)  of  canakinumab-treated  patients  and  10%  (5  patients)  of 
triamcinolone  acetonide-treated  patients  reported  infection  AEs.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  low  with  2 
patients reported in each treatment group; which may be a chance finding as there was an imbalance in 
SAEs in the overall population. Available safety data from the larger population, suggests that the subgroup 
results were comparable, again suggesting that safety data can also be extrapolated to this subgroup.  
Post-hoc  safety  analyses  in  Phase  III  patients  with  very  frequent  flares  requiring  treatment 
with corticosteroids 
In patients with very frequent flares requiring treatment with corticosteroids, another analysis compared 
potential differences in the safety profile for triamcinolone acetonide as observed in the 24-week controlled 
part  of  our  Phase  III  program.  The  rationale  is  that  these  patients  may  benefit  from  a  steroid-sparing 
alternative. 
Safety  data  are  presented  for  all  triamcinolone  acetonide  patients,  and  these  are  further  subdivided  as 
follows to investigate a potential (cumulative) ‘dose-response’ for corticosteroid safety as observed based on 
our triamcinolone acetonide experience: 
• 
• 
• 
single dose (i.e. not re-treated and only treatment for baseline flare) 
re-treated only once (i.e. total of 2 corticosteroid courses in 24 weeks) 
re-treated  ≥2  times  (‘multiple  injections’,  i.e.  total  of  ≥3  corticosteroid  courses  in  24  weeks 
[equivalent to ≥6 corticosteroid courses per year]) 
Acknowledging the limitations of this post-hoc analysis, there appears to be the possibility that multiple 
corticosteroid courses (≥3 in 6 months) may demonstrate a different (worse) safety profile emerging from 
triamcinolone  acetonide  treatment.  This  appears  to  show  increased  overall  frequency  of  adverse  events 
(71%), compared to patients with only 1 or 2 injections (50 and 49%, respectively). This could explain the 
seemingly benign safety profile observed for the corticosteroid control arm in our Phase III studies. This 
observation appears to be consistent across several system organ classes, including infections, where 21% 
of patients with multiple corticosteroid courses had infections, compared to only 11% of patients with only 
1 or 2 corticosteroid courses (see table below). 
For serious adverse events (SAEs), the  assessment  is more difficult, as there were only 8 triamcinolone 
acetonide  patients  with  SAEs,  and  this  generally  precludes  further  treatment  with  study  drug,  possibly 
resulting in underestimation of a safety dose response upon retreatment.

Table 81.  Adverse  events  by  primary  system  organ  class  (SOC)  in  triamcinolone  acetonide 
patients with different number of injections (Safety set) 
Contrasting with the inferior safety data upon multiple courses of corticosteroids, long-term and particularly 
re-treatment canakinumab safety data now provided (including now 69 patients with multiple treatments 
with canakinumab, i.e. ≥3 injections in ongoing Phase III studies), do not suggest that the canakinumab 
safety profile would worsen after multiple treatments. This results in a beneficial shift toward canakinumab 
for the indirect comparison between the relative safety of canakinumab and corticosteroids. 
Updated SCE and SCS pooled analyses including 24 week gouty arthritis studies H2356E1 and 
H2357E1 
The MAH presents pooled safety data. Double-blind, active-controlled data up to 24 weeks of observation 
from the 12 week core studies H2356 and H2357 and their 12 week extensions H2356E1 and H2357E1 in the 
planned  indication  gout.  At  least  2  injections  were  administered  to  60/253  (23.7%)  patients  in  the 
canakinumab 150 mg group versus 89/286 (31.1%) in the triamcinolone acetonide group, and  a  higher 
proportion of triamcinolone acetonide patients had 3 injections or more: 34/286 (11.9%) versus 13/253 
(5.1%) for canakinumab 150 mg. 
The highest and similar discontinuation rates were seen in the colchicine (12.0%), triamcinolone acetonide 
(11.5%) and canakinumab 150 mg (10.7%) groups, with slightly lower rates in the canakinumab ≤100 mg 
(8.3%) and ≥200 mg (7.5%) groups. A higher proportion of patients in the canakinumab ≥200 mg group 
discontinued for safety reasons (4.7%) compared to the other groups (0-2.8%).  
In  the  canakinumab  150  mg  group,  all  types  of  AEs  affected  ≤5.1%  of  patients;  back  pain  (5.1%), 
hypertension (4.7%), headache (4.7%), arthralgia (4.0%), hypertriglyceridemia (3.6%) and GGT increased 
(3.2%) were the most frequent (>3% of patients). In the comparator groups, AEs in >3% of triamcinolone 
acetonide  patients  were  hypertension  (4.5%),  headache  (4.2%),  arthralgia  (3.8%),  pain  in  extremity 
(3.8%) and (worsening of) gout (3.1%); AEs in >3% of colchicine patients were headache (5.6%), back 
pain (3.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (3.7%).

The  percentage  of  patients  with  any  AE  is  highest  in  the  ACZ885  150mg  group  compared  to  all  other 
treatment 
groups  with 
62,5% 
(ACZ885  <100mg:49,3%; 
ACZ885split 
150mg:58,5%; 
ACZ885>200mg:53,3%; Triamcinolone acetonide:50,7%; Colchicine 53,7%). As already assessed with the 
first set of data, infections and infestations are the major group of AEs followed by musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, headache, and gastrointestinal disorders. These observations also hold true for 
AEs suspected to be study drug related and for serious AEs. There is a trend for an increased number of SAEs 
of cardiac disorders in the ACZ885 150mg group (1,6%) compared to triamcinolone acetonide (0,3) but not 
compared to colchicine (1,9%). 
The overall incidence of SAEs was lower in the extension periods compared to the first 12 weeks of the study. 
No  further  trends  for  increased  numbers  of  AEs  of  special  interest  like  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation, 
immunogenicity AEs, malignancies, vertigo, severe injection site reaction or neutropenia can be seen so far. 
However for the SMQ narrow search of “Dyslipidaemia” data showing a highest incidence of these events in 
the ACZ885 150mg group was presented.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed with canakinumab. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancies  during  canakinumab  treatment  received  by  Novartis  DS&E  up  to  the  cut-off  date  of 
22-Sep-2010 and not reported in the previous CAPS submission included 5 reports: 
• 
3  patients  in  CAPS  study  D2306  (2  elective  terminations  for  non-medical  reasons    D2306- 
0041-00009],  [D2306-0041-00014]  and  1  spontaneous  abortion  in  the  wife  of  a  male  patient 
[D2306-0012-00003]) 
• 
2 spontaneous reports of exposure to canakinumab during pregnancy, outcome unreported (Argus 
case numbers PHHY2009GB14156 and PHHY2010US08288) 
As data on pregnancy and its outcome are very limited, patients are recommended not to become pregnant 
while taking canakinumab. 
Overdose 
No overdose of canakinumab has been reported in any of the clinical studies performed. Doses of up to 300 
mg s.c. in gouty arthritis and 600 mg i.v. q4weeks in RA were found to be well tolerated. 
Drug abuse 
There is no reason to suspect any pharmacological action that could result in drug abuse and no such reports 
were received.  
Withdrawal and rebound 
No withdrawal or rebound effects have been evident in any of the gouty arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis 
studies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug in the gouty arthritis dataset are summarized in the 
table below.

canakinumab groups, 0.3% for triamcinolone acetonide and 2.8% for colchicine. 
The single patient in the canakinumab 150 mg group who discontinued due to an intracranial hemorrhage is 
one of the 3 patients in the gouty arthritis dataset who died.

Post marketing experience 
Canakinumab is marketed for use in CAPS in 40 countries. AEs in these countries are collected by standard 
pharmacovigilance methods and spontaneous reports and published safety findings are also collected and 
evaluated. Integrated findings are provided in regular safety updates (PSUR) and in the Risk Management 
Plan (RMP). 
The post marketing exposure in CAPS amounts to a total patient exposure of 131 patient years, as calculated 
from the amount of substance sold and/or distributed and the recommended dose.  
The post-marketing data are consistent with the safety profile reported from clinical trials in gouty arthritis 
and RA, with no new risks identified in the Gouty Arthritis RMP despite differences in demographic, disease 
and co-morbidity characteristics.  
An  overview  of  the  total  numbers  of  adverse  reaction  reports  received  between  17-Jun-2009  and 
30-Jun-2010  is  given  in  Table  6-3.  Detailed  presentations  of  the  individual  case  safety  reports  and 
cumulative analyses are provided in the respective PSURs.

1.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the target indication gout, with the proposed dose, 253 patients were exposed. 73.9% of these were 
studied for longer than 12 weeks although none longer than 24 weeks. 28 patients received two injections 
of canakinumab, three patients received three injections, and one patient received four injections. 
In all gout dosing groups of canakinumab, 55 (8.6%) female patients were treated compared to 636 male 
patients.  Total  male  patients  in  the  canakinumab  group  with  AEs  were  319/636  (50.2%)  whereas  total 
female patients in the canakinumab group with AEs were 39/55 (71%). Due to the small number of treated 
female patients, the MAH was requested to justify the possibility of conclusive assessment of any gender 
difference regarding the adverse event profile. The MAH argued that most studied in gouty arthritis show an 
overall male/female ratio of approximately 3-4:1. Therefore the MAH concluded that the male/female ration 
in the Ilaris development program is expected from the epidemiology of the disease and is in line with other 
clinical programs of approved drugs in the disease area. The MAH’s justification was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
The  most  frequently  affected  primary  SOCs  in  the  gouty  arthritis  and  RA  datasets  were  infections  and 
infestations and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. In the canakinumab 150 mg group of the 
gouty arthritis dataset, all types of AEs shown by preferred terms affected ≤4.0% of patients; the most 
frequent AEs (≥3.0% of patients) were headache (4.0%, 10 patients), hypertension (4.0%, 10 patients) and 
back pain (3.6%, 9 patients). There is a trend for higher adverse event rates in the higher canakinumab 
dosing  groups.  Furthermore  safety  results  showed  an  increased  incidence  of  adverse  events  for 
canakinumab compared to triamcinolone acetonide, with 66% versus 53% of patients reporting any adverse 
event and 20% versus 10% of patients reporting an infection adverse event over 24 weeks 
The MAH initially applied for the use of canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients not adequately treated with 
standard of care and with the possibility of re-treatment after 14 days. During the assessment against this 
background  the  CHMP  initially  raised  safety  concerns  regarding  the  higher  incidence  of  related  adverse 
events for the canakinumab treatment group compared to the triamcinolone treatment group, insufficient 
data for retreatment, the short minimum retreatment interval of 14 days and the rise of urate levels in the 
canakinumab treatment group. The population was therefore restricted to a group of severely ill patients 
with frequent gout attacks and no other treatment options. Safety results from the subgroup of patients 
unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, with current use of ULT, or previous failure to ULT, or contraindication 
for ULT, were compared to the overall population studied in Phase III as requested by the CHMP. In this 
subgroup,  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  in  66%  of  canakinumab-treated  patients  and  47%  of 
triamcinolone  acetonide-treated  patients  which  is  comparable  to  the  overall  population  treated, 
canakinumab 66.2% versus triamcinolone acetonide 52.8%. Furthermore, the MAH proposed to change the 
re-treatment interval from 14 days to a minimum of 12 weeks and provided additional data on re-treatment 
with canakinumab, which did not raise any concern regarding safety.

In the patients in the canakinumab treatment group taking urate lowering therapy, urate levels gradually 
increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) increase of 50 (154) μmol/L, equal to approximately 
0.8mg/dL).  In  the  triamcinolone  acetonide  group  taking  urate  lowering  therapy,  urate  levels  remained 
stable from baseline to end of study (-0.4 (108) μmol/L. In patients not taking urate lowering therapy in the 
canakinumab group, urate levels also increased from baseline to end of study (mean (SD) 27 (108) μmol/L 
equal to approximately 0.4 mg/dL), while in the triamcinolone acetonide group not taking urate lowering 
therapy, mean (SD) urate again decreased slightly from baseline to end of study (-9 (111) μmol/L) equal to 
approximately 0.1mg/dL). Blood urate levels increase under treatment of canakinumab and the increase 
became greater over time and appears to be even more pronounced with the numbers of flares treated (as 
far  as  it  could  be  deduced  based  on  low  treatment  numbers).  This  increase  was  even  slightly  higher  in 
patients  taking  urate  lowering  therapy.  The  MAH  submitted  during  the  evaluation  a  literature  review  on 
blood urate levels and an overview of serum urate changes in the pooled studies H2356 and H2357 and their 
respective extension as well as data on urate level development from RA studies with canakinumab and data 
from patients with diabetes mellitus. There is an increase of serum uric acid in patients treated for acute 
gouty attacks, although the mechanism behind the influence of canakinumab on blood urate levels is not 
fully understood. A cumulative effect of urate level increase after multiple canakinumab treatments was not 
observed. Information on the occurrence of urate level increase under canakinumab treatment is included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore, increased uric acid levels are indicated as an important potential risk 
in the RMP and the post-authorisation registry will further elucidate this potential risk through a dedicated 
assessment as defined in the RMP.  
Decrease in platelet counts and thrombocytopenia was more common in the canakinumab treatment groups 
than in the control arms. The event of thrombocytopenia was included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and as an 
important identified risk in the RMP. 
An increase in the eosinopilis count was observed in a greater degree in the canakinumab higher dose groups 
compared to triamcinolone or colchicine (~5.5% of treated patients) together with a decrease in neutrophil 
count and lymphocytopenia this could lead to an increased susceptibility for infections. The risk of infections 
is included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
The frequency of vertigo and dizziness in the canakinumab treatment groups with a dose >150mg appears 
to be higher than in the lower dose treatment groups. Overall the incidence of dizziness and vertigo is lower 
than in the placebo group but higher than in the triamcinolone and colchicine comparator arms in the gouty 
arthritis indication. Vertigo and dizziness is included in sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC and as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. 
In general a low rate of anti-canakinumab antibodies across all studies was found. The MAH clarified that in 
study H2356 and its extension phase H2356E1, post-treatment samples were collected at 4 and 12 weeks 
and that in all their canakinumab clinical trial protocols it is recommended to collect two additional samples 
for  immunogenicity  at  the  time  of  the  event  and  8  weeks  later  if  anaphylactoid  reactions  occur  after 
injection.  An  integrated  immunogenicity  report  summarizing  data  on  canakinumab  across  indications  is 
being developed by the MAH and should be updated at least once a year. This report has been included in the 
RMP  as  a  new  Pharmacovigilance  activity  for  the  potential  risk  “immunogenicity/allerginicity”.  This  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
A  higher  incidence  of  any  AE  was  seen  in  the  retreated  canakinumab  patients  versus  the  non-retreated 
canakinumab patients (75.0% vs. 51.8%). The retreated triamcinolone acetonide patients also had a higher 
incidence  of  any  AE  compared  with  the  non-retreated  triamcinolone  acetonide  patients  (51.6%  versus 
41.8%), but the increase in AE incidence is much lower (23.2% versus 9.8%). The MAH argued in this case 
that this is due to the different baseline characteristics in the retreated canakinumab versus triamcinolone 
group  with  more  severe  gouty  arthritis  in  the  canakinumab  group.  This  trend  was  also  observed  in  the 
extension studies H2356E1 and H2251E1.

Safety data of long term treatment in a rheumatoid condition are only available from the RA population. In 
this population the incidence of adverse events decreased over time except the cardiac events. The rate of 
infections  is  decreasing  with  31.7%  clinically  relevant  infections  in  the  first 24  weeks  treatment  interval 
going down to 6.2% for patients treated longer than 96 and up to 144 weeks. Regular dosing (like in the RA 
groups )with canakinumab showed no clear trend for a rise in clinical chemistry values over time, but mean 
changes from baseline suggest a progression of declines in GFR and increases in lipids and creatinine with 
higher doses. However, it has to be considered that there is a difference in gender distribution between gout 
and  RA  (RA  patients  –more  female)  and  gouty  arthritis  patients  tend  to  have  more  comorbidity  (e.g. 
metabolic syndrome). Also in the overall gout population the mean age is higher than in the RA population. 
Therefore,  although  these  available  long-term  data  do  not  suggest  a  particular  concern  in  rheumatoid 
conditions and are hence  re-assuring, the long-term adverse event profile in gouty arthritis needs to be 
further explored. A post-authorisation registry was requested that will capture long-term safety data as well 
as the long-term effect on kidney function as documented in the risk management plan. 
1.7.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Clinical safety data in gouty arthritis patients is available from two phase III studies over up to 24 weeks 
duration. Around 250 patients were exposed to canakinumab in the recommended dose in phase II and III 
studies.  Neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  have  been  observed  with  a  possible  dose  relationship. 
Furthermore, there is an increased risk of infections. The events have been included as important identified 
risks  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Overall  it  was  noted  that 
treatment  with  canakinumab  is  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  adverse  events  than  treatment  with 
triamcinolone. 
There is an increase of serum uric acid in patients treated with canakinumab for acute gouty attacks. The risk 
of  urate  level  increase  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  and  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  risk 
management plan. The SmPC also advices prescribers that management of hyperuricaemia with appropriate 
urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or optimised. 
During the evaluation the intended population was therefore restricted to a group of severely ill patients with 
frequent  gout  attacks  and  no  other  treatment  options.  This  was  supported  by  a  number  of  sub-group 
analyses  of  the  safety  in  this  restricted  population.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  proposed  to  change  the 
re-treatment interval from 14 days to a minimum of 12 weeks and provided additional data on re-treatment 
with canakinumab. Taken together, based on the available data analysis the safety profile in the last-line 
patient population and the re-treatment period are considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been  included  in  the 
Summary  of  Product  Characteristics.  A  post-marketing  registry  (CACZ885H2401)  is  defined  in  the  risk 
management plan to generate additional Pharmacovigilance data addressing the important identified risks 
infections, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, as well as identified potential risks and missing information 
(including  long-terms  safety  data).  The  measures  as  defined  in  the  risk  management  plan  are  deemed 
appropriate.  
1.8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a 
risk minimisation plan. The key principles of the existing education material have been updated to include 
the new gouty arthritis indication.

1.9.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed (new 
text shown as underlined, deleted text as strikethrough): 
Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications of the SmPC 
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes 
Ilaris is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 2 years and older with body weight of 7.5 kg or above, including: 
− 
− 
Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), 
Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) / Chronic Infantile Neurological, 
Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA), 
Severe forms of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) / Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) 
presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash. 
− 
Gouty arthritis 
Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adults patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at 
least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom 
repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1). 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC 
CAPS: Adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a specialist physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of CAPS. 
Gouty arthritis 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of 
gouty arthritis and in the use of biologics. Ilaris should be administered by a healthcare professional. 
Management of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy (ULT) should be instituted or 
optimised. Ilaris should be used as an on-demand therapy to treat gouty arthritis attacks. 
The recommended dose of Ilaris for adult patients with gouty arthritis is 150 mg administered 
subcutaneously as a single dose during an attack. For maximum effect, Ilaris should be administered as soon 
as possible after the onset of a gouty arthritis attack. 
Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should not be re-treated with Ilaris. In patients who respond 
and require re-treatment, there should be an interval of at least 12 weeks before a new dose of Ilaris may 
be administered (see section 5.2). 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
Ilaris is not recommended for use in children with CAPS below 2 years of age due to a lack of clinical data. 
There is no relevant use of Ilaris for gouty arthritis in the paediatric population. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required. Clinical experience in patients above 65 years is limited, therefore caution 
is recommended. 
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC 
Infections 
Ilaris is associated with an increased incidence of serious infections. Therefore patients should be monitored 
carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after treatment with Ilaris. Physicians should 
exercise caution when administering Ilaris to patients with infections, a history of recurring infections, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 113/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. Treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated 
or continued in patients with severe infections requiring medicinal interventions. 
Treatment of CAPS 
Ilaris should not be initiated or continued in patients during an active infection requiring medical 
intervention. 
Treatment of gouty arthritis 
Ilaris should not be administered during an active infection. 
Concomitant use of Ilaris with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is not recommended because this may 
increase the risk of serious infections (see section 4.5). 
Isolated cases of unusual or opportunistic infections have been reported during Ilaris treatment. However, 
the causal relationship of Ilaris to these events is unknown. 
Concomitant use of Ilaris with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is not recommended because this may 
increase the risk of serious infections (see section 4.5). 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1.5 x 109/l) has been observed with medicinal products that 
inhibit IL-1, including Ilaris. Treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia. It is 
recommended that neutrophil counts be assessed prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to 2 months,. 
For chronic therapy in CAPS patients or repeated therapy in gouty arthritis patients, it is also recommended 
to assess neutrophil counts and periodically during treatment thereafter while receiving Ilaris. If a patient 
becomes neutropenic the ANC should be monitored closely and treatment discontinuation should be 
considered. 
[…] 
Mutation in NLRP3 gene in CAPS patients 
Clinical experience in CAPS patients without a confirmed mutation in the NLRP3 gene is limited. 
Section 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines of the SmPC 
The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some symptoms associated with CAPS. 
Patients who experience dizziness/vertigo during Ilaris treatment should wait for this to resolve completely 
before driving or operating machines. 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the SmPC 
Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. Frequency 
categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions 
are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
CAPS 
A total of 194 adult and paediatric CAPS patients (including FCAS/FCU, MWS, and NOMID/CINCA) have 
received Ilaris in clinical trials. The safety of Ilaris compared with placebo was investigated in a pivotal 
phase III trial that consisted of an 8-week, open-label period (Part I), a 24-week, randomised, double-blind 
and placebo-controlled withdrawal period (Part II), and a 16-week open label period on Ilaris (Part III). All 
patients were treated with Ilaris 150 mg subcutaneous or 2 mg/kg if body weight was ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg. 
Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. Frequency 
categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to

During clinical trials with Ilaris in CAPS patients mean values for haemoglobin increased and those for white 
blood cell, neutrophils and platelets decreased. 
Gouty arthritis 
More than 700 patients with gouty arthritis have been treated with Ilaris at doses from 10 mg to 300 mg in 
randomised, double-blind and active-controlled clinical trials of up to 24 weeks’ duration. More than 
250 patients have been treated with the recommended dose of 150 mg in Phase II and III trials (see 
section5.1).

Laboratory abnormalities in gouty arthritis patients 
Haematology 
Decreased white blood cell counts (WBC) ≤ 0.8 x lower limit of normal (LLN) were reported in 6.7% of 
patients treated with Ilaris compared to 1.4% treated with triamcinolone acetonide. Decreases in absolute 
neutrophil counts (ANC) to less than 1x109/l were reported in 2% of patients in the comparative trials. 
Isolated cases of ANC counts < 0.5x109/l were also observed (see section 4.4). 
Mild (< LLN and > 75x109/l) and transient decreases in platelet counts were observed at a higher incidence 
(12.7%) with Ilaris in the active-controlled clinical studies versus the comparator (7.7%) in gouty arthritis 
patients. 
Uric acid 
Increases in uric acid level (0.7 mg/dl at 12 weeks and 0.5 mg/dl at 24 weeks) were observed after Ilaris 
treatment in comparative trials in gouty arthritis. In another study, among patients who were starting on 
ULT, increases in uric acid were not observed. Uric acid increases were not observed in clinical trials in 
non-gouty arthritis populations (see section 5.1). 
ALT/AST 
Mean and median increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) of 3.0 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, and in 
aspartate transaminase (AST) of 2.7 U/l and 2.0 U/l, respectively, from baseline to end of study were seen 
in the Ilaris-treated groups versus the triamcinolone acetonide-treated group(s), however the incidence of 
clinically significant changes (≥ 3x the upper limit of normal) was greater for patients treated with 
triamcinolone acetonide (2.5% for both AST and ALT) compared with Ilaris-treated patients (1.6% for ALT 
and 0.8% for AST). 
Triglycerides 
In active-controlled gouty arthritis trials, there was a mean increase in triglycerides of 33.5 mg/dl in 
Ilaris-treated patients compared with a modest decrease of -3.1 mg/dl with triamcinolone acetonide. The 
incidence of patients with triglyceride elevations > 5x upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2.4% with Ilaris and 
0.7% with triamcinolone acetonide. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown. 
[…] 
Elderly population 
There is no significant difference in safety profile observed in patients ≥ 65 years of age.

Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
CAPS 
In clinical studies, CAPS patients who have uncontrolled over-production of IL-1 beta show a rapid response 
to therapy with canakinumab, i.e. laboratory parameters such as high C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum 
amyloid A (SAA), high neutrophil and platelet counts, and leukocytosis rapidly returned to normal. 
Gouty arthritis 
A gouty arthritis attack is caused by urate (monosodium urate monohydrate) crystals in the joint and 
surrounding tissue, which trigger resident macrophages to produce IL-1 beta via the “NALP3 inflammasome” 
complex. Activation of macrophages and concomitant over-production of IL-1 beta results in an acute 
painful inflammatory response. Other activators of the innate immune system, such as endogenous agonists 
of toll-like receptors, may contribute to the transcriptional activation of the IL-1 beta gene, initiating a gouty 
arthritis attack. Following canakinumab treatment, the inflammatory markers CRP or SAA and signs of acute 
inflammation (e.g. pain, swelling, redness) in the affected joint subside rapidly. 
Clinical efficacy and safety data 
CAPS 
[…] 
Gouty arthritis 
The efficacy of Ilaris for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis attacks was demonstrated in two multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with frequent gouty arthritis (≥ 3 attacks in 
the previous 12 months) unable to use NSAIDs or colchicine (due to contraindication, intolerance or lack of 
efficacy). The studies were 12 weeks followed by 12-week double-blind extension. A total of 225 patients 
were treated with subcutaneous Ilaris 150 mg and 229 patients were treated with intramuscular 
triamcinolone acetonide (TA) 40 mg at study entry, and when experiencing a new attack thereafter. The 
mean number of gouty arthritis attacks in the previous 12 months was 6.5. Over 85% of patients had 
comorbidity, including hypertension (60%), diabetes (15%), ischaemic heart disease (12%), and stage ≥ 3 
chronic kidney disease (25%). Approximately one-third of the patients enrolled (76 [33.8%] in the Ilaris 
group and 84 [36.7%] in the triamcinolone acetonide group) had documented inability (intolerance, 
contraindication or lack of response) to use both NSAIDs and colchicine. Concomitant treatment with ULTs 
was reported by 42% of patients at entry. 
The co-primary endpoints were: (i) gouty arthritis pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) at 72 hours 
post-dose, and (ii) time to first new gouty arthritis attack. 
For the overall study population, pain intensity was statistically significantly lower for Ilaris 150 mg 
compared with triamcinolone acetonide at 72 hours. Ilaris also reduced the risk of subsequent attacks (see 
Table 4). 
Efficacy results in a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine and who were on ULT, 
failed ULT or had a contraindication to ULT (N=101) were consistent with the overall study population with 
a statistically significant difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide in pain intensity at 72 hours 
(-10.2 mm, p=0.0208) and in reduction of risk of subsequent attacks (Hazard ratio 0.39, p=0.0047 at 
24 weeks). 
Efficacy results for a more stringent subgroup limited to current users of ULT (N=62) are presented in 
Table 4. Treatment with Ilaris induced a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of subsequent attacks in 
patients using ULT and unable to use both NSAIDs and colchicine, although the observed treatment 
difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide was less pronounced than with the overall study population.

an infection adverse event over 24 weeks. 
Elderly population 
Overall, the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of Ilaris in elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age was 
comparable to patients < 65 years of age. 
Patients on urate lowering therapy (ULT) 
In clinical studies, Ilaris has been safely administered with ULT. In the overall study population, patients on 
ULT had a less pronounced treatment difference in both pain reduction and reduction in the risk of 
subsequent gouty arthritis attacks compared to patients not on ULT. 
Immunogenicity 
No anaphylactic reactions were observed in patients treated with Ilaris. 
Antibodies against Ilaris were observed in approximately 1.5% and 2% of the patients treated with Ilaris for 
CAPS and gouty arthritis, respectively. 
This medicinal product has been authorised for CAPS under “Exceptional Circumstances”. This means that 
due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal 
product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ilaris in one 
or more subsets of the paediatric population in Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS). See 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ilaris in all 
subsets of the paediatric population in gouty arthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the SmPC 
CAPS 
The peak serum canakinumab concentration (Cmax) occurred approximately 7 days following single 
subcutaneous administration of 150 mg in adult CAPS patients. The mean terminal half-life was 26 days. . 
Mean values for Cmax und AUCinf after a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg in a typical adult CAPS patient 
(70 kg) were 15.9 µg/ml and 708 µg*d/ml. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in the CAPS 
population, including children from 2 years of age, t The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously 
administered canakinumab was estimated to be 66%. The apparent clearance (CL/F) and distribution 
volume (Vss) of canakinumab increases with varied accordingly body weight. CL and distribution volume 
(Vss) were estimated to be 0.17 l/day and 6.2 litres, respectively, in a typical CAPS patient of body weight 
70 kg.

The expected accumulation ratio was 1.3-fold and 1.1-fold following 6 months of subcutaneous 
administration of 150 mg canakinumab every 8 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively (see section 4.2). 
Exposure parameters (such as AUC and Cmax) increased in proportion to dose over the dose range of 0.30 to 
10.0 mg/kg given as intravenous infusion or from 150 to 600 mg as subcutaneous injection. Predicted 
steady-state exposure values were slightly higher in the weight category 40-70 kg compared to the weight 
categories < 40 kg and > 70 kg. 
Gouty arthritis population 
Bioavailability in gouty arthritis patients has not been determined independently. Apparent clearance per kg 
body weight (CL/F per kg) was comparable between the gouty arthritis and CAPS population (0.004 l/d/kg). 
Mean exposure in a typical gouty arthritis patient (93 kg) after a single subcutaneous 150 mg dose (Cmax: 
10.8 µg/ml and AUCinf: 495 µg*d/ml) was lower than in a typical 70 kg CAPS patient (15.9 µg/ml and 
708 µg*d/ml). This is consistent with the observed increase in CL/F with body weight. 
Elderly population 
No change in pharmacokinetic parameters based on clearance or volume of distribution were observed 
between elderly patients and adult patients < 65 years of age. 
Section D. Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product of Annex II 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
• 
The physician information should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The risk of serious infections, including opportunistic bacterial, viral and fungal infections in patients 
treated with Ilaris; 
The risk of acute injection-related reactions; 
For CAPS patients: tThe need to instruct patients on proper techniques for self-administration when 
the patient is willing and capable to do so, and guidance for Health Care Professionals on how to 
report administration errors; 
The identified or potential risk of immunogenicity that might lead to immune-mediated symptoms. 
For gouty arthritis patients: highlighting that intermittent therapy or re-exposure after a long 
treatment-free interval may be associated with an enhanced immune response (or loss of immune 
tolerance) to Ilaris and thus re-treated patients must be considered at risk of hypersensitivity 
reactions; 
For chronic therapy in CAPS: the need for Health Care Professionals to perform an annual clinical 
assessment of patients regarding a potential increased risk for the development of malignancies; 
•  As treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia, tThe need to measure 
neutrophil counts prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to 2 months. For chronic therapy in 
CAPS patients or repeated therapy in gouty arthritis patients, it is recommended to assess 
neutrophil counts and periodically during treatment thereafter while receiving Ilaris as treatment 
with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia; 
Section 1. What Ilaris is used for of the PL 
What Ilaris is 
Ilaris is intended for treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and gouty arthritis. It 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin inhibitors. The active substance in Ilaris is canakinumab, 
a monoclonal antibody. It blocks the activity of a substance called interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the body, 
which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases such as CAPS and gouty arthritis. 
What Ilaris is used for 
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes 
Ilaris is used in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older with body weight of 7.5 kg or above 
to treat the following auto-inflammatory diseases, which are collectively known as Cryopyrin-Associated 
Periodic Syndromes (CAPS): 
− 
− 
Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS),

In patients with CAPS, the body produces excessive amounts of IL-1 beta. This may lead to symptoms such 
as fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, 
canakinumab leads to an improvement in these symptoms. 
Gouty arthritis 
Ilaris is used in adults to treat the symptoms of frequent gouty arthritis attacks if other treatments have not 
worked well enough. 
Gouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of a chemical called urate crystals in the body. These crystals 
cause excessive production of IL-1 beta, which in turn can lead to sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and 
swelling in a joint (known as a gouty arthritis attack). By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, canakinumab 
leads to an improvement in these symptoms. 
Section 2. What you need to know before you take Ilaris of the PL 
Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Ilaris if any of the following applies to you: 
− 
if you currently have an infection or if you have had repeated infections or a condition such as a known 
low level of white blood cells which makes you more likely to get infections. 
if you have or have ever had tuberculosis or direct contact with a person with an active tuberculosis 
infection. Your doctor may also check whether you have tuberculosis using a specific test. 
− 
Children and adolescents 
- 
- 
CAPS: Ilaris is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age. 
Gouty arthritis: Ilaris is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Driving and using machines 
Ilaris treatment may give you Some symptoms associated with CAPS or with Ilaris treatment, such as a 
spinning sensation (dizziness/known as vertigo),. This may affect your ability to drive or use tools or 
machines. If you feel a spinning sensation, do not drive or operate use any tools or machines until you are 
feeling normal again. 
Section 3. How to use Ilaris of the PL 
If you have CAPS, yYou may inject yourself with Ilaris after proper training. 
If you have gouty arthritis, your treatment will be overseen by a doctor with specialist training. Ilaris should 
be injected by a healthcare professional only. 
How much Ilaris to use 
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes 
The recommended starting dose of Ilaris is: 
Gouty arthritis 
Your doctor will discuss with you the need to start or adjust a urate lowering therapy to lower the uric acid 
level in your blood. 
The recommended dose of Ilaris for adult gouty arthritis patients is 150 mg given as a single dose at the time 
of a gouty arthritis attack. 
If you need another treatment with Ilaris, and got relief from the last dose, you must wait at least 12 weeks 
before the next dose. 
Injecting Ilaris yourself 
If you have CAPS, you may inject yourself with Ilaris aAfter proper training in the correct injection 
technique, you may inject Ilaris yourself. 
How long to use Ilaris 
- 
If you have CAPS, yYou should continue using Ilaris for as long as your doctor tells you. 
- 
If you have a gouty arthritis attack, you will be given a single dose of Ilaris. If you experience a new 
attack, your doctor may consider giving you a new dose of Ilaris but not earlier than 12 weeks from the previous 
dose.

If you use more Ilaris than you should 
− 
− 
If you accidentally inject more Ilaris than the recommended dose, it is unlikely to be serious, but you 
should inform your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible. 
In CAPS, yYou should not inject Ilaris earlier than 8 weeks after the last dose, unless your doctor tells 
you to. If you accidentally inject Ilaris sooner than you should, you should tell your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use Ilaris 
If you have CAPS and have forgotten to inject a dose of Ilaris, inject the next dose as soon as you remember. 
Then talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. You should then continue with 
injections at 8-week intervals as before.

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Canakinumab  was  tested  in  two  pivotal  phase  III  trials  for  superiority  against  the  active  comparator 
triamcinolone. Benefit was demonstrated through a reduction of pain intensity as well as reduction of time 
to new flare. In the overall study population, a statistically significant superior pain relief of canakinumab 
compared to triamcinolone was observed: the VAS pain reduction at 72 hours mean difference versus the 
active  comparator  triamcinolone  was  –  10.7  (p=0.0001).  Also  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in 
frequency of new flares for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone was observed (HR 0.38, p=0.0001).  
In sub-groups representing patients with limited treatment options compared to this overall population a 
less pronounced benefit was demonstrated. In patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, and who were 
on ULT, or failed ULT or were contraindicated to ULT (n=101), the VAS pain reduction at 72 hours mean 
difference versus triamcinolone was – 10.2 (p=0.0208) and the reduction in frequency of new flares was 
statistically  superior  (HR  0.39,  p=0.0151  at  24  weeks).  Looking  only  at  current  users  of  urate  lowering 
therapy  of  this  group  (n=62),  the  treatment  effect  of  canakinumab  was  comparable  to  the  effect  of 
triamcinolone but was not statistically superior neither for the first co-primary endpoint VAS pain reduction 
at  72  hours  (mean  difference  versus  triamcinolone:  -  3.8,  p=0,2798),  nor  for  the  second  co-primary 
endpoint  “reduction  in  frequency  of  new  flares  for  canakinumab  compared  to  triamcinolone”  (HR  0.91, 
p=04166 (at 24 weeks)). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The demonstration of efficacy in the restricted population of severely ill patients with frequent gout attacks 
and no other treatment options is limited to a subgroup analyses of only 101 patients (unable to use NSAIDs 
and colchicine; ULT (current use, failure, or contraindication)). Also the subpopulation “for whom repeated 
courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate” was not specifically defined in the inclusion criteria. However, 
it is accepted that the efficacy demonstration generated in the overall population is sufficiently robust to be 
extrapolated to the patient population with no remaining treatment options. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the canakinumab 150 mg group of the gouty arthritis dataset, most frequent AEs (≥3.0% of patients) 
were headache (4.0%, 10 patients), hypertension (4.0%, 10 patients) and back pain (3.6%, 9 patients). 
There  is  a  trend  for  higher  adverse  event  rates  in  the  higher  canakinumab  dosing  groups.  Furthermore 
safety results showed an increased incidence of adverse events for canakinumab compared to triamcinolone 
acetonide, with 66% versus 53% of patients reporting any adverse event (infections, vertigo, dizziness, 
gastro-intestinal AEs, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) and 20% versus 10% of patients reporting an 
infection adverse event over 24 weeks. This was also demonstrated for the subgroup unable to use NSAIDs 
and colchicine, ULT (use/failure/CI) and for the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, 
and current users of ULT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 121/136 
 
 
  
 
There is an increase of serum uric acid in patients treated with canakinumab for acute gouty attacks. The risk 
of  urate  level  increase  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC  and  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  risk 
management plan with a post-marketing registry adequately addressing the need for additional data. The 
SmPC also advices prescribers that management of hyperuricaemia with appropriate urate lowering therapy 
(ULT) should be instituted or optimised. 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been observed with a possible dose relationship. These events are 
identified in the risk management plan as identified risks together with the risk for infections – and additional 
safety data will be generated in a post-marketing registry (CACZ885H2401). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavorable effects 
During the evaluation the intended population was restricted to a group of severely ill patients with frequent 
gout attacks and no other treatment options. This was supported by a number of sub-group analyses in this 
restricted population. Furthermore, the MAH proposed to change the re-treatment interval from 14 days to 
a minimum of 12 weeks and provided additional data on re-treatment with canakinumab. Taken together, 
based  on  the  available  data  analysis  the  safety  profile  in  the  last-line  patient  population  and  the 
re-treatment period are considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
There is limited long term safety data for the use of canakinumab in in rheumatoid conditions available. The 
post-marketing registry (CACZ885H2401) as defined in the risk management plan will generate additional 
Pharmacovigilance data. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Canakinumab is a symptomatic treatment of gouty arthritis flares with the aim of reducing pain and local 
inflammation.  The  underlying  pathophysiology  of  increased  blood  urate  levels  and  aggregation  of  urate 
crystals in the joints is not a target of treatment. A favourable effect was demonstrated through a reduction 
of pain intensity as well as reduction of time to new flare in the overall population where superiority over the 
active comparator was shown. The effect in the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine 
was less pronounced. 
The safety profile for the treatment of gouty arthritis with canakinumab includes the risks of neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia, as well as infections. Furthermore, an increase of serum uric acid was observed. Given 
that the safety profile appeared inferior to the active comparator triamcinolone, this seems not acceptable in 
a  population  that  can  be  treated  with  available  standard  of  care  as  well  as  glucocorticoids.  However,  in 
patients in whom such treatment options do no longer exist and who suffer from severe gouty arthritis with 
frequent attacks, the safety profile is considered acceptable if appropriate guidance for its management is 
provided to prescribers and patients. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Acknowledging that canakinumab demonstrated its efficacy in symptomatic pain relief and considering in the 
overall gouty arthritis population, where however other treatment options with a better safety profile exist, 
there  is  a  sub-population  of  severely  ill  gouty  arthritis  patients  with  a  long  standing  disease,  multiple 
co-morbidities and a lack of available treatment options, in whom treatment with canakinumab can be a 
clinically meaningful treatment option. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance in the 
last line treatment of gouty arthritis patients defined as follows:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1634/2013 
Page 122/136 
 
 
  
 
“Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at 
least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or  do not provide an adequate response, and in whom 
repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1).” 
is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Gout is a disease with increasing incidence in the industrial world population with increasing numbers of 
patients having severe forms, recurrent  flares and arthritic joint deformities. There is an  unmet medical 
need for an improvement of causal as well as symptomatic therapy for patients who have exhausted the 
treatment options under standard of care considering that long term treatment with corticosteroids has a 
problematic long term safety profile. 
Symptomatic  treatment  with  canakinumab  is  efficacious  in  pain  relief  and  statistically  superior  to 
triamcinolone acetonide in the overall patient population. However, only 42% of study population was on 
urate lowering therapy and for this subgroup relatively lower efficacy was suggested, and around 65% of the 
studies patients could have been able to benefit from available treatment options. Furthermore, a higher 
incidence of related adverse events under canakinumab compared to triamcinolone treatment was noted. 
Therefore, during the evaluation the indication was restricted to the symptomatic treatment of adult patients 
with frequent gouty arthritis attacks in whom NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated., 
or  do  not  provide  an  adequate  response,  and  in  whom  repeated  courses  of  corticosteroids  are  not 
appropriate. A number of subgroup analyses to support the efficacy and safety profile of canakinumab in this 
restricted indication were provided. 
The  CHMP  concludes  that  canakinumab  in  severely  ill  patients  with  frequent  gout  attacks  and  no  other 
treatment  options,  i.e.  contraindication  for  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  and  for  whom  repeated  courses  of 
corticosteroids are not appropriate, offers a new treatment option addressing an unmet need. An adequate 
risk management program, including a post-marketing registry, has been defined to manage and further 
explore the safety profile of canakinumab in this population.

an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that, prior to launch, all physicians who are expected 
to prescribe/use Ilaris are provided with a physician information pack containing the following: 
• 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
Physician information 
Patient Alert Card 
The physician information should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The risk of serious infections, including opportunistic bacterial, viral and fungal infections in patients 
treated with Ilaris; 
The risk of acute injection-related reactions; 
For CAPS patients: the need to instruct patients on proper techniques for self-administration when 
the patient is willing and capable to do so, and guidance for Health Care Professionals on how to 
report administration errors; 
The identified or potential risk of immunogenicity that might lead to immune-mediated symptoms. 
For gouty arthritis patients: highlighting that intermittent therapy or re-exposure after a long 
treatment-free interval may be associated with an enhanced immune response (or loss of immune 
tolerance) to Ilaris and thus re-treated patients must be considered at risk of hypersensitivity 
reactions; 
For chronic therapy in CAPS: the need for Health Care Professionals to perform an annual clinical 
assessment of patients regarding a potential increased risk for the development of malignancies; 
Assessment report

•  As treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in patients with neutropenia, the need to measure 
neutrophil counts prior to initiating treatment and again after 1 to 2 months. For chronic therapy in 
CAPS patients or repeated therapy in gouty arthritis patients, it is recommended to assess 
neutrophil counts periodically during treatment; 
The need to monitor patients for changes in their lipid profiles; 
The unknown safety of Ilaris in pregnant and lactating women, thus the need for physicians to 
discuss this risk with patients if they become or plan to become pregnant; 
The proper patient management as regards the interaction with vaccination; 
The possibility to include patients in the registry study to facilitate the collection of long term efficacy 
and safety data;

Description 
The MAH is requested to provide reports on the ß-Confident 
registry (CACZ885D2401), which was designed to provide data 
on long-term safety and effectiveness of Ilaris treatment in 
paediatric and adult patients in routine clinical practice. In these 
reports the MAH is requested to specifically assess cases for 
whom there is a loss of efficacy (patients reported to have 
discontinued Ilaris for lack-of-therapeutic response) to 
determine whether this is due to changes over time in PK/PD or 
antibody development (where data is available) or in whom a 
dose adjustment has led to improved therapeutic response 
(patients with a dose up titration without discontinuation for 
lack-of-therapeutic response). 
The MAH is required to provide updates on the recruitment rates 
and any intermediary results annually within the annual 
re-assessment. 
The patients should be included in the Registry until both 
following conditions are met: 5 years recruitment period and 
200 patients included.

Introduction 
Canakinumab  (ACZ885)  is  a  high-affinity  human  monoclonal  antibody  against  interleukin-1β  (IL-1β) 
developed to bind and neutralize the excess IL-1β produced in some inflammatory diseases. It belongs to 
the class of drugs known as immune modulators. IL-1β is released by mononuclear phagocytes upon injury 
or infection and plays a dominant role in the pathobiology of autoinflammatory conditions. 
Canakinumab, registered under the tradename Ilaris, has been granted a marketing authorisation in the EEA 
for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) in adults, adolescents and children 
aged  4  years  and  older  with  body  weight  above  15  kg,  including  Muckle-Wells  Syndrome  (MWS), 
Neonatal-Onset  Multisystem  Inflammatory  Disease  (NOMID),  and  severe  forms  of  Familial  Cold 
Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond coldinduced urticarial skin 
rash. The dose is 150 mg for CAPS patients with body weight > 40 kg and 2 mg/kg for CAPS patients with 
body weight ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 40 kg. Ilaris is administered every eight weeks as a single dose via subcutaneous 
injection. 
The  present  type  II  variation  concerns  the  application  for  a  new  indication  to  cover  the  symptomatic 
treatment  of  patients  with  frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  in  a  clinically  relevant  subgroup  who  are  not 
successfully treated with current standard of care. The proposed population are gouty arthritis suffers with 
frequent flares (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and 
in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate. 
With the submission of this application for a new indication in gouty arthritis, the MAH requested for an 
additional year of marketing protection in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Furthermore, reference is made to the European Commission “Guidance on elements required to support the 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to 
benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period” dating November 2007. 
Justification  of  significant  clinical  benefit  as  presented  by  the 
applicant 
The  applicant  provided  with  the  request  a  justification  for  the  significant  clinical  benefit  of  the  new 
therapeutic  indication  compared  to  existing  therapies.  The  key  elements  of  this  justification  can  be 
summarised as follows.

Proposed new indication as compared to already authorised indication 
The  currently  authorised  condition  Cryopyrin-Associated  Periodic  Syndrome  (CAPS)  is  a  spectrum  of 
disorders  associated  with  mutations  in  the  NLRP3/CIAS1  gene  on  chromosome  1q44  that  encodes  the 
protein known as NLRP3 (formerly NALP3) or cryopyrin. The individual disorders are known as Familial Cold 
Autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), also known as Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU), Muckle-Wells syndrome 
(MWS), and Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), also known as Chronic, Infantile, 
Neurologic, Cutaneous, Articular (CINCA) syndrome. These conditions may occur singly or as overlapping 
syndromes (i.e. MWS/FCAS or MWS/NOMID). The world-wide incidence is unknown but only a few hundred 
cases are currently diagnosed. In clinical studies, treatment with Ilaris had a  rapid onset of action, with 
disappearance or clinically significant improvement of symptoms within one day after dosing. Laboratory 
parameters such as high C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), high neutrophils and platelet 
counts normalised rapidly within days of Ilaris injection. 
The new therapeutic indication concerns the symptomatic treatment of gouty arthritis. Gout is an arthritic 
condition characterized by the deposition of urate crystals primarily in joints. Urate crystals may then trigger 
an acute inflammatory response in the affected joint which is characterized by extreme pain and edema. The 
cellular pathophysiological mechanism of joint inflammation in gout has been connected to the 
hyperproduction of IL-1β by selective activation of the NRLP3 inflammasome by urate crystals (Di Giovine et 
al 1987; Martinon et al 2008). Preclinical experiments in vivo or ex vivo revealed a sequence of cellular 
events which establish a role of IL-1 in inflammation induced by urate crystals. Final proof of this hypothesis 
for the pathophysiology of gout came from the clinical application of recombinant IL-1ra, anakinra, in gout 
patients which led to a rapid relief of symptoms (So et al 2007). Canakinumab interrupts the signaling 
pathway of crystal-induced inflammation in gouty arthritis by blocking IL-1β, and thus is a therapy to treat 
and prevent flares in gouty arthritis refractory to, or unable to take, standard of care medications. 
Gouty arthritis is becoming more frequent worldwide, mostly as a result of dietary factors and population 
aging. Although uric acid lowering therapy is standard of care and known to lower serum uric acid levels, of 
the approximately 11 million gouty arthritis sufferers in the US and EU, approximately 3 million (10-20%) 
are  not  adequately  managed  (Fels  and  Sundy  2008),  as  prophylaxis  has  failed,  flares  continue,  and  the 
patients have become  refractory to, or cannot tolerate standard-of-care. 
Refractory, or difficult-to-treat, gouty arthritis is increasing (Terkeltaub et al 2003). Patients have recurrent 
flares, often lasting up to 2 weeks, take longer to resolve (Masseoud et al 2005), and generally have chronic 
arthritis with destructive tophi. Other medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, metabolic 
syndrome,  renal  impairment  or  coronary  artery  diseases  (Terkeltaub  et  al  2003)  limit  the  use  of  many 
traditional therapies. 
Gouty arthritis that is insufficiently treated tends to worsen over time. Attacks become more frequent, more 
severe, involve more joints, and lead to chronic active gouty arthritis, with tophi, chronic granulomatous 
synovitis and bone erosion (Dalbeth et al 2009). Urate lowering therapy, even when started relatively early, 
does not always prevent progression to chronic gouty arthritis (Sundy et al. 2008). 
Chronic, poorly controlled gouty arthritis predicts deteriorating joint function and chronic tophaceous gouty 
arthritis severely impairs functional capacity (Becker et al 2009, Dalbeth et al 2007). As patients with gouty 
arthritis are increasingly of working age, there is a substantial burden of work-related and health-related 
costs (Brook et al 2006, Kleinman el al 2007), and a diminished quality of life (Dalbeth et al 2007) associated 
with progressive, severe chronic gouty arthritis. 
Existing therapies 
Existing therapies were summarised by the applicant as follows:

Urate lowering therapy is the standard of care for the treatment of chronic gout as this therapy has been 
shown  to  lower  serum  urate  and  therefore  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  gout  attacks.  However,  urate 
lowering-therapy  often  fails  to  lower  uric  acid  to  the  target  levels  at  which  flares  are  less  common  (<6 
mg/dL).  E.g. in patients treated with allopurinol only about half of the treatment-compliant patients reach 
target levels (Halpern et al 2009). In addition, poor renal function, poor tolerability or hypersensitivity often 
prevents more rigorous use of urate lowering therapy gout prophylaxis. Hence, urate lowering therapy, even 
though  it  is  a  mainstay  of  gout  therapy,  is  not  able  to  eliminate  the  occurrence  of  acute  gouty  arthritis 
attacks in some patients which take it, and obviously not in those patients which don’t take urate lowering 
therapies for the reasons mentioned above. 
Full-dose NSAIDs, such as diclofenac or indomethacin, are widely viewed as first-line therapy for acute gouty 
arthritis attacks. However, their wide-spread utility is limited in some patients by gastrointestinal or CNS 
tolerability. Furthermore, these medications may impair renal function and are contraindicated in cases of 
prior  peptic  ulcer  disease,  bleeding  or  perforation,  heart  failure,  or  in  those  using  platelet  aggregation 
inhibitors. 
Colchicine is effective for the treatment of gout attacks but has a narrow therapeutic margin, which limits its 
use for treating acute attacks. Orally, gastrointestinal tolerability is poor, often causing diarrhea, nausea, 
vomiting and cramps. Colchicine use has also resulted in renal or hepatic impairment, myelosuppression, 
neuropathy and myopathy and mortablity has been reported with the i.v. formulation. Due to the mortality 
rate when given i.v., this route is no longer used. In addition, there are a number of potential drug-drug 
interactions  with  colchicine  which  limits  its  use  (e.g.  erythromycin,  cyclosporine,  tacrolimus,  verapamil, 
diltiazem and various HIV protease inhibitors). 
Corticosteroid therapy for acute gouty arthritis attacks is equally effective as treatment with NSAIDs but 
requires relatively high doses to treat acute flares (Janssens 2008). However, repeated use presents risks in 
patients with multiple flares each year, as it has the potential for pituitary axis suppression, osteoporosis, 
increased  infections,  hypertension  and  glucose  intolerance  is  present,  and  co-morbidities  typical  for 
middleaged patients such as heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes may be worsened. Local injection of 
steroids  minimizing  system  side-effects  is  not  feasible  in  refractory  patients  which  flare  in  many  joints. 
Hence,  frequently  flaring  gouty  arthritis  patients  which  are  dependent  on  disease  management  with 
corticosteroids are especially vulnerable to suffer from typical corticosteroid side-effects and efforts should 
be  made  to  limit  their  exposure  to  the  required  minimum.  As  such,  corticosteroid  therapy  of  acutely 
symptomatic gout is considered last resort in patients who are frequently flaring, who present with some of 
the above mentioned comorbidities, and who do not respond to NSAIDs or colchicine. For lack of a different 
choice the benefit harm balance of corticosteroid therapy in these patients currently has to be accepted 
unless a different treatment option becomes available which would enable to weigh the corticosteroid vs the 
alternatives’ benefit harm balances in the context of the individual refractory patient.

Significant clinical benefit 
According to the applicant, the significant clinical benefit of Ilaris in comparison to existing therapies is based 
on 
its  mechanism 
of 
action  which  makes 
it 
a 
targeted 
treatment, 
on 
its 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties and on the efficacy and safety data in the target indication 
and  population  i.e.  patients  with  frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  (at  least  3  attacks  in  the  previous  12 
months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are 
not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are 
not appropriate. The data are coming mainly from two Phase III trials (H2356 & H2357) and their blinded 
extension  studies,  which  demonstrated  superiority  of  canakinumab  150  mg  s.c.  versus  triamcinolone 
acetonide 40 mg i.m. on pain relief in patients with frequent flares of gout and for whom NSAIDs and/or 
colchicine are contraindicated (absolute or relative), not tolerated or ineffective. Canakinumab 150 mg s.c. 
or triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg i.m was given upon acute gout flares (at entry and upon any new flare). 
Efficacy and safety data 
The  2  pivotal  trials  (core  studies)  had  a  12  week,  randomized,  double  blind,  double  dummy,  active 
controlled, superiority study design. As placebo-controlled trials raise ethical concerns, an active control, 40 
mg  i.m.  triamcinolone  acetonide,  was  used.  Although  not  widely  studied,  corticosteroids  have  proven 
efficacy in acute gouty arthritis, and the i.m. route ensures full compliance and avoids complex dosing and 
tapering regimens . No corticosteroid regimen is proven to be more effective than any other and higher 
triamcinolone acetonide doses are not known to be more effective. 
The efficacy criteria were superiority in 2 co-primary variables (pain intensity at 72 hours and time to first 
new gouty arthritis flare), both to be met at the one-sided 2.5% level. Both studies have double blind active 
controlled extensions to 24 weeks in which patients are treated upon flare with the same treatment they 
were allocated during the 12 week core study.   
Efficacy 
As a targeted therapy, canakinumab directly neutralizes one of the key inflammatory pathways involved in 
the pathogenesis of gouty arthritis. Canakinumab at 150 mg s.c. on demand, showed efficacy benefits in the 
symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 
months) in whom nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are 
not  tolerated,  or  do  not  provide  an  adequate  response  and  which  receive  appropriate  management  of 
hyperuricaemia  which  includes  patients  currently  using  urate-lowering  therapy  (ULT),  or  patients  who 
previously failed ULT or patients in whom ULT is contraindicated.Canakinumab was significantly better than 
triamcinolone acetonide at treating the signs and symptoms of acute flares, inducing pain relief, improving 
the physician’s assessments of global response, tenderness, swelling and erythema, inflammatory markers 
and in reducing the use of corticosteroid rescue medication. 
It was also effective in reducing the frequency of subsequent flares as shown by reducing the probability of 
new flare, increasing the number of patients free of new flares and reducing the average number of flares 
per patient. New flares tended to be less severe (less initial pain) and of shorter duration, and efficacy upon 
re-treatment was just as effective as it had been for the baseline flare. 
Canakinumab at 150 mg s.c. on demand, has also been shown to maintain these benefits, as summarized for 
the 24 week period[Canakinumab continued to show a strong effect on reducing the frequency and severity 
of new flares, as shown by the probability of new flare, the patients free of  new flares and the average 
number  of  flares  per  patient,  a  trend  towards  a  reduced  severity  of  new  flares  (less  pain  and  shorter 
duration), and reduced use of corticosteroids as rescue medication.

The following table shows key efficacy parameters of the overall study population and the subpopulation  
representing a group of patients which currently only have corticosteroids as a treatment option. The fact 
that this subgroup is not limited to only patients on ULT but also includes patients which failed ULT or in 
whom ULT is contraindicated, reflects the current clinical reality that what is desirable, i.e. optimization of 
ULT, is not achieved in every gout patient (Doherty et al 2012). 
Table 1 
Efficacy for the overall and a subgroup of patients unable to use both NSAIDs and 
colchicine and patients currently using ULT, or patients who previously failed ULT 
or patients for whom ULT is contraindicated 
The results suggest that in the subpopulation of patients which are strictly on ULT and unable to use both 
NSAIDs and colchicine (N=62), treatment with Ilaris induced a reduction of pain and reduced the risk of 
subsequent attacks. However, the observed treatment difference compared to triamcinolone acetonide was 
less pronounced than with the overall study population on pain intensity at 72 hours ( -3.8 mm, p=0.2798) 
and  on  the  risk  reduction  of  subsequent  attacks  (Hazard  ratio  0.71,  p=0.2337).  In  the  subpopulation 
(N=101) representing patient candidates for the proposed indication, changes from baseline show a fast and 
clinically relevant onset of action in patients treated with canakinumab with absolute improvement in pain 
intensity compared to baseline of 16.7mm, 23.2mm and 31.8mm after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. As 
a relative improvement this corresponds to >20% (slightly improved patient-perceived pain according to 
pain transition scale), >30% and >40% (much improved patient-perceived pain according to pain transition 
scale) compared to baseline (74.6mm) after 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively (Salaffi et al, 2004). Further, 
a  ≥20%  improvement  in  pain  (after  24  hours)  has  been  suggested  recently  to  define  an  appropriate 
response in gouty arthritis attacks (Khanna D, 2011).

Safety 
Safety results from the subgroup of patients unable to use NSAIDs and colchicine, and with appropriate 
management of ULT (i.e. current use of ULT, or previous failure to ULT, or contraindication for ULT), which 
resembles most closely the proposed indication population, are now provided . However, it is of note that 
this studied population was by study design able to frequently use corticosteroids, as the study had with 
triamcinolone acetonide a corticosteroid as comparator, while the full description of the proposed indicated 
population is further limited to patients “in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate”. 
In this subgroup, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 66% of canakinumab-treated patients and 47% of 
triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients which is similar to the overall population treated, canakinumab 
66.2% vs triamcinolone acetonide 52.8%. 
Results in this subgroup are also very consistent for the known increased risk of infections for canakinumab, 
with 20% of canakinumab-treated patients and only 10% of triamcinolone acetonide-treated patients as 
compared to the overall population, with canakinumab 20.4% vs triamcinolone acetonide 12.2%. 
The ultimate revised label indication will require that patients additionally be unsuitable for repeat courses of 
corticosteroids.  Comparative  information  regarding  safety  of  corticosteroids  in  the  ultimate  proposed 
population  from patients who receive corticosteroids for lack of alternative, is lacking. Such corticosteroids 
safety data may be difficult to generate in a new, prospective trial, given that such restricted patients, once 
identified, should avoid corticosteroids at the time of inclusion. Proxy data drawn from the literature and 
label  highlights  numerous  risks  for  corticosteroids  patients,  and  a  full  discussion  was  presented  and  a 
post-hoc safety analysis for very frequently flaring patients treated with 3 or more courses of corticosteroids 
within the 24 weeks of the blinded core and extension 1 studies was presented. 
Limitations of available safety data 
An  intrinsic  limitation  of  the  available  data  for  the  intended  target  population  of  patients  unable  to  use 
NSAIDs and colchicine, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate, is the fact that 
for the canakinumab program only a proxy population could be studied. Here, patients could still take at 
least 1 of the standard of care anti-inflammatory drugs, as all patients enrolled were to be able to take a 
corticosteroid, the active comparator triamcinolone acetonide used in the studies. 
On  the  other  hand,  studying  canakinumab  in  a  placebo-controlled  design  for  the  proposed  indicated 
population (symptomatic treatment of patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the 
previous  12  months)  in  whom  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are 
contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses 
of corticosteroids are not appropriate), would (i) raise ethical concerns in a severely painful condition like 
acute gouty arthritis, and (ii) safety comparisons against placebo would be of limited informative value for 
the purpose of assessing potential significant clinical benefits in comparison with existing therapies.

The  post-hoc  safety  analysis  for  very  frequently  flaring  patients  treated  with  3  or  more  courses  of 
corticosteroids within the 24 weeks of the blinded core and extension 1 studies mentioned in the previous 
section is presented. Having received three or more injections of triamcinolone acetate is clearly associated 
with an increased risk to  experience AEs in several  SOCs  vs  having received only one injection (i.e. not 
re-treated). As an example, the risk of infection is indeed rising with increasing triamcinolone acetate use 
from 10.7% in patients with single use of the drug to 20.6% in patients with at least 3 injections over the 
course of 24 weeks.

Important safety benefits 
The potential for steroid-sparing benefits in co-morbid patients is very relevant clinically, especially in older 
patients  with  frequent,  multiple  comorbidities.  Corticosteroids  carry  the  risks  of  pituitary  suppression, 
osteoporosis,  of  exacerbating  heart  failure,  infection,  hypertension  and  diabetes,  and  demand  complex 
dosing and tapering regimens.  
Canakinumab should allow many patients to reduce the use of corticosteroids as a treatment for flare and 
also as a concomitant rescue medication. 
Unmet medical need 
As described above the unmet medical need in difficult-to-treat patients with frequent flares is to optimally 
treat the existing flare. Treatment with canakinumab should be useful in patients unable to take NSAIDs and 
colchicine and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate. This population, although 
small  in  number,  is  clearly  not  able  to  be  treated  with  standard  of  care.  Whereas  most  patients  can  be 
successfully  managed  with  current  treatments,  a  minority  remain  inadequately  treated.  These  are  the 
patients with frequent attacks, with tolerability issues, with co-morbidities and contraindications, which limit 
or prohibit the use of existing treatments NSAIDs and colchicine. 
In patients who are refractory, because they have failed or cannot take first-line therapies, there is an urgent 
need for effective management of signs and symptoms of an acute flare. 
The potential for steroid-sparing benefits in co-morbid patients was identifiable, even in the relatively short 
trials  (12  weeks).  Corticosteroids  carry  the  risks  of  pituitary  suppression,  osteoporosis,  of  exacerbating 
heart failure, hypertension and diabetes, and demand complex dosing and tapering regimens.  
MAH´s conclusion supporting significant clinical benefit 
Treatment  options  are  limited  for  gouty  arthritis  patients  with  frequent  attacks,  in  whom  NSAIDs  and 
colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and repeated courses 
of  corticosteroids  are  not  appropriate.  Although  corticosteroids  are  effective  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressant drugs, their frequent use is associated with adverse outcomes, including osteoporosis, 
peptic ulcer disease, cataract development, avascular necrosis, new onset or worsening of existing diabetes 
or hypertension. Although the literature examining frequent corticosteroid use in gouty arthritis is limited, 
corticosteroid  reduction  and  elimination  are  frequent  endpoints  in  trials  in  rheumatology  and  other 
therapeutic areas. Hence, for the small subgroup of gouty arthritis patients there is a clear unmet medical 
need  for  alternative  treatment  options,  and  canakinumab  has  demonstrated  significant  benefit  in  the 
treatment of gouty arthritis attacks. The treatment benefit on both coprimary endpoints in the refractory 
population is consistent with the benefit seen in the overall study population. The risks are also comparable 
with those seen in the broader population studied in the Phase III studies. 
Novartis fully supports use of uric acid lowering therapy for patients with frequent attacks of gouty arthritis. 
Appropriate  management  of  hyperuricaemia  is  standard  of  care  and  should  be  required  in  all  medically 
appropriate patients. Nevertheless, the clinical reality is that not all do nor can be adequately managed, e.g. 
ULT  failures  or  having  contraindications  for  ULT  use.  Canakinumab  is  hence  not  indicated  for  the 
management  of  hyperuricaemia  but  can  serve  as  an  adjunct  therapy  to  appropriate  management  of 
hyperuricaemia in the proposed refractory population.

According to the “Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison 
with  existing  therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year) 
marketing protection period” a medicinal product acting through a different principal mechanism of action 
and thus providing a treatment alternative, or producing a response different from other treatments in a 
substantial part of the target population can be considered of significant clinical benefit. Although the target 
population for canakinumab treatment in gouty arthritis is very small, canakinumab provides a clinically 
meaningful treatment benefit in a substantial part of this proposed refractory population and as such should 
be considered a significant clinical benefit for this population with very limited treatment options. 
Assessment of the applicant´s justification of significant clinical 
benefit 
Proposed new indication 
The CHMP agrees that the newly proposed therapeutic indication “symptomatic treatment of adult patients 
with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an 
adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.” is different from 
the already authorised indication for the treatment of CAPS since the two underlying clinical conditions are 
different as outlined by the applicant. 
Existing therapies 
The  CHMP  agrees  that  due  to  limitations  of  existing  therapies  there  is  an  unmet  medical  need  for  the 
“symptomatic treatment  of  adult  patients  with  frequent  gouty  arthritis  attacks  (at  least 3  attacks  in  the 
previous  12  months)  in  whom  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are 
contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses 
of corticosteroids are not appropriate”. Urate lowering therapy is the basic causual therapy of gouty arthritis 
whereas  canakinumab  is  intended  to  be  symptomatic  “add-on-treatment”  in  dfifficult  to  treat  patients. 
NSAID  and  colchicine  could  be  considered  available  therapies  with  equivalent  efficacy  compared  to 
canakinumab; as the indication is however restricted to patients, “in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  colchicine  are  contraindicated,  are  not  tolerated,  or  do  not  provide  an  adequate 
response”  there  is  a  clinical  relevance  for  canakinumab  as  last  resort.  In  terms  of  corticosteroids,  the 
available  pivotal  randomized  clinical  trials  showed  statistical  significance  in  terms  of  superiority  over 
triamcinolone, whereas the safety profile of canakinumab is considered inferior compared to triamcinolone 
for the enrolled study population in the pivotal studies. The restricted indication requires that patients be 
unsuitable  for  repeat  use  of  corticosteroids  (“and  in  whom  repeated  courses  of  corticosteroids  are  not 
appropriate”) so an unmet need will be addressed.  
In addition to the existing therapies discussed by the applicant, pegloticase has been approved in January 
2013 for the treatment of severe debilitating chronic tophaceous gout in adult patients who may also have 
erosive joint involvement and who have failed to normalize serum uric acid with xanthine oxidase inhibitors 
at  the  maximum  medically  appropriate  dose  or  for  whom  these  medicines  are  contraindicated.  This 
recombinant  uricase  acts  by  catalyzing  the  oxidation  of  uric  acid  into  allantoin  hence  the  mechanism  of 
action  of  pegloticase  is  different  from  the  one  of  canakinumab  and  the  use  of  the  two  products  in  the 
therapeutic armentarium differs.

Significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies based on major contribution to 
patient care 
Acknowledging that canakinumab demonstrated its efficacy in symptomatic pain relief in the overall gouty 
arthritis population, where however other treatment options with a better safety profile exist, there is a 
sub-population of severely ill gouty arthritis patients with a long standing disease, multiple co-morbidities 
and  a  lack  of  available  treatment  options,  in  whom  treatment  with  canakinumab  can  be  a  clinically 
meaningful treatment option. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance in the last line 
treatment of gouty arthritis patients defined as follows:  
“Ilaris is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at 
least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or  do not provide an adequate response, and in whom 
repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate (see section 5.1).” 
is positive. 
Canakinumab acts through a different principal mechanism of action and provides a treatment alternative 
for those patients for whom other standard therapies are no options, that means canakinumab can be used 
as a last line therapy, if all other existing symptomatic therapies are not indicated any more.  
In the “Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing 
therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing 
protection period (November 2007)” it is outlined that “even without showing greater efficacy or greater 
safety, a medicinal product having shown a benefit risk balance at least similar to existing therapies could be 
considered of significant clinical benefit if it acts through a different principal mechanism of action and thus 
provides a treatment alternative, or it produces a response different from other treatments in a substantial 
part of the targeted population.” 
Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  provided,  the  final  restricted  indication  in  a 
sub-population with no other therapeutic options and its new mechanism of action the CHMP agrees that the 
significant clinical benefit based on contribution to patient care has been demonstrated for canakinumab. 
CHMP Conclusion 
The  CHMP  concludes  that  canakinumab  in  severely  ill  patients  with  frequent  gout  attacks  and  no  other 
treatment  options,  i.e.  contraindication  for  NSAIDs  and  colchicine  and  for  whom  repeated  courses  of 
corticosteroids are not appropriate, offers a new treatment option addressing an unmet need. An adequate 
risk management program, including a post-marketing registry, has been defined to manage and further 
explore the safety profile of canakinumab in this population. Therefore the CHMP supports the applicant’s 
justification for an additional year of marketing protection based on the new therapeutic indication for Ilaris 
in the symptomatic treatment of gouty arthritis attacks. 
Outcome 
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) 
of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  726/2004,  and  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  “Guidance  on  elements 
required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic 
indication in order to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period (November 2007)”, 
and considered that the extension of the marketing protection to 11 years is justified.

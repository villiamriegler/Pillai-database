By a letter dated 18 September 2013, the European Commission (EC) requested the CHMP to 
assess if dimethyl fumarate is different from Fumaderm composed of dimethyl fumarate, 
calcium salt of ethyl fumarate, magnesium salt of ethyl hydrogen fumarate and zinc salt of 
ethyl hydrogen fumarate with a view to include an assessment of the new active substance 
(‘NAS’) status of dimethyl fumarate in Tecfidera, as per applicant request.

initial opinion and considered that dimethyl fumarate is different from Fumaderm composed 
of  dimethyl  fumarate,  calcium  salt  of  ethyl  fumarate,  magnesium  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen 
fumarate  and  zinc  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate.  Based  on  the  review  of  the  scientific 
evidence, and in line with clarification provided by the European Commission that: 
i)  a  new  active  substance  under  Directive  2001/83/EC  is  a  chemical  substance  not  previously 
authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union (Annex I to the Notice to applicants 
Volume  2A,  Procedures  for  marketing  authorisation,  Chapter  1,  Marketing  authorisations, 
June 2013) and, 
ii)  dimethyl  fumarate  is  part  of  the  medicinal  product  Fumaderm  authorised  in  1994  in  Germany, 
but it has not been previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union,  
the active substance of Tecfidera, dimethyl fumarate, is a new active substance.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Dimethyl  fumarate1  (DMF)  is  the  dimethyl  ester  of  fumaric  acid.    Both  DMF  and  its  primary 
metabolite  monomethyl  fumarate  (MMF)  were  found  to  activate  the  “Nuclear  factor  (erythroid-
derived 2) like 2” (Nrf2) transcriptional pathway which is the principle cellular defence system for 
responding to a variety of potentially toxic stimuli, including inflammatory and oxidative stress. By 
activating the  Nrf2  pathway,  DMF  is  claimed  to  reduce  inflammatory  responses  in  both  peripheral 
and  central  cells,  and  promotes  cytoprotection  of  central  nervous  system  cells  against  toxic 
stressors,  demonstrating  beneficial  effects  on  pathways  known  to  exacerbate  multiple  sclerosis 
pathology.    
The  following  indication  was  initially  applied  for:  disease  modifying  therapy  in  adult  patients  with 
relapsing  multiple  sclerosis  to  reduce  the  frequency  of  relapses  and  to  delay  the  progression  of 
disability.  The  proposed  posology  was  a  starting  dose  of  120  mg  twice  a  day.  After  7 days,  the 
dose is increased to the recommended dose of 240 mg twice a day. 
The  final  recommended  indication  was:  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting 
multiple sclerosis. 
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  is  a  chronic,  progressive,  autoimmune,  debilitating  neurodegenerative 
disorder  with  multifocal  demyelination  affecting  the  brain,  optic  nerves,  and  spinal  cord  and  this 
process  leads  to  neurological  impairment  and  severe  disability.  It  is  one  of  the  most  common 
neurological  diseases  in  young  adults  and  the  leading  cause  of  non-traumatic  disability  in  young 
and  middle-aged  adults.  Typically,  it  begins  in  the  second  or  third  decade  of  life.  In  2008,  the 
global  incidence  was  estimated  at  2.5  individuals  per  100 000  and  the  global  prevalence  was 
estimated  at  30  individuals  per  100 000,  with  women  being  at  a  two  times  higher  likelihood  to 
develop  MS  than  men.  Regionally,  the  estimated  median  prevalence  of  MS  is  greatest  in  Europe 
(80  per  100 000),  followed  by  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  (14.9  per  100 000),  the  Americas  (8.3 
per  100 000),  the  Western  Pacific  (5  per  100 000),  Southeast  Asia  (2.8  per  100 000),  and  Africa 
(0.3 per 100 000). 
The  classification  of  MS  into  4  distinct  clinical  categories  was  suggested  by  Lublin  and  Reingold 
shortly after the availability of the first disease-modifying treatments as a means to aid physicians 
in providing care. The following categories were included: relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, with clearly 
defined  disease  relapses  (clinical  attacks)  with  full  recovery  or  with  sequelae  and  residual  deficit 
upon recovery, and with periods between relapses characterized by a lack of disease progression; 
secondary–progressive (SP) MS, with continuous neurological decline with or without superimposed 
relapses,  that  follows  an  initial  period  of  RR  disease;  Primary–progressive  (PP)  MS,  characterized 
by  a  slow  worsening  from  onset,  without  superimposed  relapses;  and  progressive–relapsing  (PR) 
MS, indicating slow worsening from the onset, but with superimposed relapse events as well. 
Relapsing forms of MS are the most frequent clinical presentation of the disease. Eighty-two (82) 
to  85  %  of  all  patients  present  with  relapsing-remitting  (RR)  MS,  which  is  characterised  by 
unpredictable  acute  episodes  of  neurological  dysfunction  named  relapses,  followed  by  variable 
recovery  and  periods  of  clinical  stability.  Within  ten  years  more  than  50%  of  patients  who 
presented with a RR form eventually develop sustained deterioration with or without superimposed 
relapses; this form is called the secondary progressive variety of MS (SPMS).  
1 Also called BG00012 through the report 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 12/126 
 
  
  
  
                                                
The  term  relapsing  MS  (RMS)  applies  to  those  patients  either  with  a  RRMS  form  or  a  SPMS  form 
that  are  suffering  relapses.  Patients  with  RMS,  in  spite  of  suffering  from  different  MS  forms, 
constitute a common target for current treatments. 
Currently,  most  of  the  available  disease  modifying  therapies  for  MS  are  administered 
subcutaneously,  intramuscularly  or  intravenously.  These  therapies  aim  to  prevent  relapses  and 
ultimately  to  diminish  the  accumulation  of  disability.  Due  to  their  safety  profiles  (e.g.  risk  of 
opportunistic  infections  and  secondary  malignancies),  most  of  the  recently  authorised  products 
were considered as second line options. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as gastro-resistant hard capsule containing 120 mg and 240 mg 
of dimethyl fumarate as active substance. The composition is described in section 6.1. of the 
SmPC. 
The product is available in PVC/PE/PVDC-PVC/Alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Dimethyl fumarate is a white to off-white powder, non-hygroscopic, BCS class 1 (highly soluble and 
highly permeable).  The chemical name is Dimethyl (E)-butenedioate and has the following 
structural formula: 
The  molecular  structure  of  the  dimethyl  fumarate  has  been  confirmed  by  1H-NMR-,  13C-NMR-, 
UV/VIS- spectroscopy, MS, FT-IR-spectrometry and X-ray powder diffraction. Typical spectra have 
been  provided  along  with  a  detailed  interpretation  of  signals.  Only  one  crystal  form  has  been 
observed  by  powder  XRD  and  DSC  investigations.  Results  of  DSC/TGA  thermograms  confirm  the 
affinity to sublimation. 
Dimethyl fumarate has a non-chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has not been observed for 
dimethyl fumarate. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured by two manufacturers. It is synthesized in two main steps 
using commercially available, well defined starting materials.    
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 13/126 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
Dimethyl fumarate is synthesized by acid-catalysed esterification reaction (Fischer esterification).  
The manufacturing process of both manufacturers is the same except production scale batch sizes.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (FT-IR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), sulphate (Ph.Eur.), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), 
residue on ignition (Ph.Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction).  
Each specification parameter was sufficiently justified. Acceptance criteria for non-compendial tests 
have been set in accordance with batch results and CHMP/ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis data are provided for 36 production scale batches produced with the proposed 
synthetic route, from both manufacturing sites, and the batch analysis data show that the active 
ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Sufficient information is provided on potential impurities and residual solvents. Levels of impurities 
found in the batches of the active substance are low and well below specification limits. 
Analytical procedures have been adequately described and appropriately validated.  
Stability 
Total number of 11 batches of the active substance from both manufacturing sites were put on 
stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) and intermediate 
(30°C/65%RH) conditions for up to 60 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 
months.  
The following parameters were tested: description, assay and impurities. Particle size does not 
change during storage, as confirmed by a suitable study; therefore, it is not necessary for it to be 
tested routinely in stability studies.  
Photostability testing and forced degradation studies were conducted during the development. The 
results provide good information on degradation patterns of the active substance.   
The stability results presented are well within specification. Re-test period of 60 months without 
special storage condition is considered justified.  
2.2.3  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The formulation development has been adequately described. The aim was to develop a delayed-
release formulation that prevents release of the active ingredient in the gastric environment while 
allowing for rapid release of the active ingredient in the intestine region. Design of the finished 
product formulation was based on the desired gastro-resistant properties and on the physico-
chemical properties of the active substance, which is highly soluble, independent of pH, and has 
high permeability. No physicochemical characteristics of the active substance were identified as 
critical.  
The finished product is developed as 2 mm enteric-coated microtablets in size 0 hard gelatin 
capsules, in strengths 120 mg and 240 mg, respectively. The 120 mg strength capsules have white 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 14/126 
 
  
  
  
 
body with green cap, for the 240 mg strength capsules with green body and green cap are used. 
The capsules are imprinted with company identifiers. The microtablets are composed of immediate 
release tablet core (dimethyl fumarate, crosscarmellose sodium as disintegrant, microcrystalline 
cellulose as diluent and binder, magnesium stearate as lubricant and talc (for 120 mg strength 
only) and colloidal anhydrous silica as glidants), and two layers of coating. All excipients used are 
compendial.     
The  120  mg  strength  product  was  first  developed  and  was  used  in  the  earlier  phases  of  clinical 
development. The 240 mg strength capsule was developed subsequently based on the formulation 
for the 120 mg finished product. The composition of the microtablet cores slightly differs between 
the  strengths.  A  bioequivalence  study  between  the  120  mg  and  the  240  mg  capsules  shows 
bioequivalence between the two strengths in fasted state. The difference in excipients amounts has 
no impact on release and dissolution behaviour of the product. Both product strengths showed no 
significant  release  in  0.1  N  HCl  after  120  minutes  (acid  stage).  In  the  buffer  stage,  percent 
dissolution  was  determined  at  the  10,  20,  30,  45,  and  60  minute time  points and  a  rapid  release 
was observed for both product strengths. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine/limed bone is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers 
of gelatine used in the capsule manufacture are provided.  
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin.  
Manufacture of the product 
During  the  manufacturing  process,  the  excipients  and  active  substance  are  blended  together  and 
compressed into microtablets. The microtablets are then coated and finally encapsulated into hard 
gelatin capsules. The capsules are packaged in PVC/PE/PVDC-PVC/Alu blisters. The material of the 
packaging complies with the Ph.Eur. requirements.   
Critical  quality  attributes  of  the  dosage  form  include  friability,  assay,  content  uniformity  and 
disintegration  in  acid  solution.  All  process  steps  related  to  these  attributes  are  monitored  by 
appropriate  in-process  controls.  However,  none  of  the  manufacturing  steps  is  considered  critical. 
There are no intermediates in the manufacturing process of the product.  
The manufacturing process was successfully validated on all product manufacturing steps, for three 
commercial  scale  batches  per  strength.  All  acceptance  criteria  have  been  met  during  validation, 
providing a high degree of assurance that the process will consistently produce material meeting its 
pre-determined specifications and quality attributes. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form. 
The  product  is  tested  for  description  of  the  capsule,  description  of  the  capsule  content, 
identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  and  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvent  isopropylalcohol  (GC), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.Eur.  –  acid  and  buffer  stage)  and  water 
content  (Karl  Fischer).  The  active  substance  is  a  known  inhibitor  of  mould  and  bacteria  growth. 
This  was  confirmed  by  a  number  of  tests  during  the  product  development.  Therefore,  it  is 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 15/126 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
acceptable  to  test  microbial  purity  in  the  specification  of  the  product  only  at  first  10  commercial 
batches and then introduce skip testing, if microbial growth is not observed.   
The  acceptance  criteria  for  all  specification  parameters  are  justified  by  batch  results  and  comply 
with  CHMP/ICH  guidelines.  Two  impurities/degradation  products  are  specified  in  the  finished 
product.  One  of  them  is  an  endogenous  substance  in  human  body,  the  other  is  a  metabolite; 
therefore,  there  are  no  safety  concerns  related  to  these  impurities.  All  other  impurities  are 
controlled under the unspecified impurity limit.  
All  test  methods  for  the  finished  product  control  are  sufficiently  described  and  appropriately 
validated.  
Batch analysis results for 10 batches (120 mg) + 6 batches (240 mg) of commercial scale confirm 
consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data of three  full  scale  registration  batches  and  three  full  scale  validation  batches  stored 
under long term conditions at 25ºC/60%RH and intermediate conditions at 30ºC/65%RH for up to 
60  months  and  for  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40ºC/75%RH  were  provided  for  the 
120  mg  strength.  For  the  240mg  strength  up  to  12  months  data  was  presented  at  the 
30ºC/65%RH condition and up to 6 months under the same accelerated conditions.  Results for 4 
supportive clinical batches were also provided for the 120 mg strength. The studies were conducted 
according  to  appropriate  CHMP/ICH  guidelines.  The  stability  batches  are  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Bulk  stability  testing  on  capsules  was  conducted  to  establish  a  hold  time  prior  to  packaging. 
Ongoing studies to extend the hold time are being conducted in accordance with ICH Guideline Q1A 
Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The proposed 18 month hold time for drug 
product  packaged  in  bulk  and  stored  at  or  below  25°C  is  supported  by  18  months  of  real  time 
stability data. 
Stability  samples  were  tested  for  description  of  the  capsule,  description  of  the  capsule  content, 
assay,  impurities,  disintegration,  dissolution  and  microbial  purity.  The  analytical  procedures  used 
are stability indicating. 
In  addition,  the  product  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The product is not sensitive to light, if stored in the 
primary  packaging.  Additional  temperature  cycling  studies  were  conducted  to  support  transient 
exposure  of  the  finished  product  at  worst  case  distribution  temperatures  ranging  from  -20°C  to 
50°C. Results confirm the product stability at short term temperature excursions.  
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the 
SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
All  pivotal  non-clinical  safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance 
with GLP regulations, except the in vivo cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology study 
in  dogs.  Nonetheless,  this  in vivo  safety  pharmacology  study  in  dogs  has  been  adequately 
documented as study report and its results coincide with those of other investigations. Hence, the 
lack of formal GLP compliance is regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Dimethyl  fumarate  (DMF/BG0012)  has  been  evaluated  in  a  series  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
pharmacological  tests  used  to  characterise  its  effects  on  Nrf2  antioxidant  pathway,  inflammatory 
and neural cells.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
DMF  is  claimed  to  act  as  an  anti-inflammatory  and  neuroprotective  agent  by  activating  the  Nrf2 
antioxidant pathway. 
In vitro studies using immortalised adenocarcinoma or transformed human embryonic kidney cells, 
astrocytes,  oligodendrocytes  and  hippocampal  neurons  revealed  that  DMF  and  its  primary  active 
metabolite MMF were both able to release the transcription factor Nrf2 from cytoplasmic repression 
and proteosomal degradation by direct alkylation of the Nrf2 repressor Keap 1 (Kelch-like erythroid 
cell-derived  protein  with  CNC  homology-associated  protein 1).  This  resulted  in  increasing  Nrf2 
levels  and  thus  activating  downstream  genes  of  the  Nrf2  antioxidant  pathway,  i.e.  NADPH 
dehydrogenase  (NQO1)  glutathione  reductase  and  aldo-keto  reductase  family 1  member B8 
(Akr1b8).  Activation  of  Nrf2  antioxidant  pathway  was  evident  in  astrocytes  by  increased  cellular 
redox and mitochondrial membrane potentials, elevated glutathione and ATP levels and resistance 
against  H2O2  treatment.  In vivo,  DMF  induced  NQO1  in  lymphoid  organs  and  Akr1b8  in 
gastrointestinal  tissues  in  wild  type  mice  and  rats  for  up  to  24 h.  The  dependency  of  oxidative 
protection on Nrf2 was confirmed in vitro by silencing of Nrf2 transcription with specific siRNA and 
in vivo by the lack of a pharmacodynamic response in Nrf2-/- mice.  
DMF also significantly diminished excitotoxic lesion volume (44 and 61 %, at DMF doses of 75 and 
100 mg/kg, respectively) and improved neuronal survival as well as functional neurological deficits 
(41 % at 100 mg/kg DMF) following intrastriatal malonate injection in rats. 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 17/126 
 
  
  
  
In  an  experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE)  disease  model  of  MS  rats,  DMF  dose-
dependently  inhibited  disease  symptoms  (demyelination  and  cellular  degeneration),  with  a  partial 
reduction  at  100 mg/kg  DMF  and  complete  abrogation  at  200 mg/kg  DMF.  Twice  daily  instead  of 
once  daily  dosing  improved  efficacy  of  the  100 mg/kg  to  a  level  similar  to  the  200 mg/kg  dose. 
Prolonged  DMF  treatment  for  32 days  induced  antioxidant  pathway  genes  NQO1  and  Akr1b8  to 
levels comparable to those of healthy rats. 
DMF and MMF were also found to exert anti-inflammatory activity as shown by suppression of LPS-
mediated  induction  of  inflammatory  cytokines  in vitro  (TNFα,  IL1β,  CXCL10,  CCL4).  This  anti-
inflammatory  effect  relied  on  Nrf2  at  low  levels  of  DMF  or  MMF,  but  became  independent  at  high 
concentrations, in macrophages from WT and Nrf2-/- mice. 
In rat collagen-induced arthritis model, DMF reduced inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration 
by  inhibiting pro-inflammatory  cytokine  expression  and  activation  of  macrophages.  Likewise,  DMF 
also exerted anti-inflammatory activities in rat EAE model by inhibition of activation of astrocytes, 
macrophages and microglia. 
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
These studies were not performed by the applicant and this was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP on the basis of the overall non clinical findings. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular system 
DMF  and  MMF  at  60,  180,  600  and  1500  μM  (n  =  3  or  4)  did  not  significantly  inhibit  the  hERG 
channel  (≤3.6%  and  ≤1.2%,  respectively),  and  the  IC50  was  considered  to  be  >1500  μM.    At 
doses  of  60,  600  and 1500  µM,  DMF  and  MMF  did  not  alter  cardiac  conduction  of  canine  Purkinje 
fibres.  
In telemetered dogs treated with vehicle on Day 1 and 10, 100, and 1000 mg/kg DMF on Days 6, 
8,  and  12,  vomiting  was observed  in  all  animals  at  doses  >  100  mg/kg/day.    Elevated  heart  rate 
was  also  noted  from  approximately  3  hours  post-dosing  and  lasted  until  9-12  hours  post-dose.  
Mean  arterial  blood  pressure  in  the  animals  treated  with  the  100  and  1000  mg/kg  dose  levels 
decreased  to  approximately  90  to  100  mmHg  at  3  hours  post  dose,  as  compared  to  the  controls 
(approximately 100 to 120 mm Hg) and remained approximately 10 to 15 mmHg below the vehicle 
control  animal  levels  through  13  to  15  hours  post  dose.    The  time  period  of  elevated  heart  rates 
and  decreased  arterial  blood  pressures  was  similar  in  all  of  the  animals  treated  with  DMF, 
suggesting  that  these  observations  were  related  to  treatment.    There  were  no  effects  of  DMF  on 
the  QT  interval  on  ECG  corrected  for  heart  rate  (QTc),  and  no  ECG  abnormalities,  even  at  supra-
therapeutic doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 
Respiratory system 
In telemetered dogs (same in vivo study evaluating cardiovascular effects as described above), no 
effects on respiratory rate, peak thoracic pressure were noted. 
Central Nervous system 
These studies were performed using Fumaderm, which contains as main constituent DMF (56 %). 
When  tested  after  oral  administration  of  Fumaderm  up  to  464  mg/kg,  DMF  did  not  show 
pharmacological effects on motility, nociceptive behaviour, sleeping time, body temperature.

2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
These studies were not performed by the applicant and this was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP, on the basis of the available clinical data on drug interactions. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  metabolism  of  DMF  were  investigated  using  the  following  animal 
species: rats, dogs and monkeys. 
After oral administration, DMF was rapidly absorbed and converted pre-systemically to monomethyl 
fumarate (MMF) with Tmax of 0.5 to 1 h rats, and 0.5 to 2 h in dogs. The clearance of MMF was also 
rapid as evident by half-lives of around 1.3 h in rats and up to 1 h in dogs. Direct administration of 
DMF  to  sites  of  the  intestinal  tract  indicated  predominant  absorption  of  DMF  in  duodenum  and 
jejunum. Gender differences in pharmacokinetic profile were apparent in rats only with about 1.7-
fold  higher  exposure  of  females  compared  to  males.  In  dogs,  compared  to  extended  release 
formulations,  the  DMF  commercial  formulation  (enteric-coated  microtablets)  revealed  rapid 
absorption (Tmax 1.13 h) higher exposure (Cmax 6.16 µg/ml; AUCinf 7.91 µg·h/ml) and accelerated 
elimination (t 1/2 0.517 h). After repeated doses of 5, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg in dogs, MMF exposure 
(AUClast)  generally  increased  dose-dependently.    C max  at  all  dosages  and  AUC  of  the  75 mg/kg 
group were less than dose-proportional and both t 1/2 and Cl/F appeared to be independent of dose. 
In  the  toxicology  studies,  the  overall  exposure  (AUC  and  Cmax)  of  MMF  increased  dose 
proportionally in all species after repeated administration. In rats, the higher exposure of females 
than  in  males  was  also  evident  in  toxicokinetic  determinations.  No  accumulation  was  observed 
across species. 
Independently  of  the  DMF  dose,  MMF  was  found  to  have  a  very  low  binding  to  proteins  in  rats, 
dogs, monkeys, and human plasma. Most significant binding was noted to human plasma proteins 
(unbound  55.1-66.1 %),  whereas  substantial  lower  binding  was  observed  in  dogs  and  monkeys 
(unbound  76-78.7 %  and  90-100 %,  respectively)  and  even  complete  absence  of  binding  was 
found in rats. 
After  oral  administration  in  rats,  14C-labelled  DMF  widely  distributed  outside  the  gastrointestinal 
tract reaching maximum levels in kidneys, glandular tissues and brain. 
In rats, DMF was subject to extensive metabolism and was predominantly eliminated by exhalation 
of CO 2 (60.9 % in males, 64.5 % in females). The main metabolite in plasma could be identified as 
glucose,  whereas  the  combination  of  fumaric  acid  and  citric  acid  was  also  detected  at  prominent 
levels.  These  findings  suggested  DMF  and  MMF  metabolic  pathway  involved  esterases  and 
production of fumaric acid that is likely to enter into the highly conserved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 
cycle  leading  to  generation  of  water,  CO2  and  glucose.  Due  to  rapid  DMF  transformation  to other 
metabolites,  a  minor  amount  of  the  radioactive  DMF  dose  (< 0.2 %)  was  found  to  be  excreted 
unchanged  in  urine.  About  21 %  of  the  DMF  radioactive  dose  was  determined  in  urine.  Cysteine 
and  N-acetyl  cysteine  conjugates  of  mono-  and  dimethyl  succinate were the major  metabolites in 
urine, whereas MMF represented only up to 1.7 % of the radioactive dose. Faecal elimination was 
negligible (≤ 4.4 %). No gender differences were observed in the metabolic profile of DMF and all 
metabolites identified in humans were found in rats. 
MMF  has  been  shown  not  to  induce  or  inhibit  many  of  the  major  human  CYP  enzymes  (CYP1A2, 
2B6,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  2E1,  and  3A4).  In  vitro  studies  using  Caco-2  cells  also  indicated  that 
DMF was not a substrate or an inhibitor of P-gp.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity studies were performed in mice and rats using oral and intraperitoneal (i.p) routes. 
In mice, the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was 316 mg/kg for both routes, whereas in rats, the 
NOEL was 681 mg/kg  for males and 316 mg/kg for females. The estimated lethal dose in 50% of 
animals (LD 50) was slightly higher in males (920 mg/kg i.p., 1200 mg/kg p.o in mice , 910 mg/kg 
i.p.,  3220  mg/kg p.o  in  rats)  as  compared  to  females  (990 mg/kg  i.p.,  1340  mg/kg p.o.  in  mice, 
820 mg/kg i.p., 2630 mg/kg p.o in rats).  
In  mice,  clinical  signs  of  reduced  motility,  ataxia,  dyspnoea,  cyanosis,  muscular  hypotonia  were 
observed at oral doses as low as 681 mg/kg. Ataxia and hypopnoea were observed at i.p doses as 
low as 464 mg/kg.  
In rats, ataxia, muscular hypotonia, inhibited respiratory rate and motility were noted at oral doses 
as  low  as  2610  mg/kg.  Reduced  food  intake  and  decreased  body  weight  gain  were  seen  at  1470 
and  2150  mg/kg,  respectively.  Ataxia,  muscular  hypotonia,  reduced  motility  and  respiratory  rate 
were also observed at i.p. doses as low as 681 mg/kg. Dyspnea (825mg/kg); tremor, pilo-erection 
(1000 mg/kg); abdominal positioning (1470 mg/kg) were also noted. 
In  these  studies,  the  kidneys,  forestomach  and  liver  were  identified  as  target  organs  of  DMF-
toxicity.  
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose studies have  been conducted in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys  using the oral route. 
In mice, doses were ranging from 50 to 400 mg/kg in both studies of 4 and 13 week durations. In 
rats, doses were ranging from 50 to 500 mg/kg (3 months) and 25 to 200 mg/kg (6 months). In 
dogs,  doses  ranged  from  25  to  125  mg/kg  (18  days,  dose  ranging),  50  to  250  mg/kg  (4  week, 
comparison to Fumaderm) and 5-75 mg/kg (11 months). In monkeys, doses ranged from 5 to 125 
mg/kg (2 weeks) and 5 to 75mg/kg (12 months). Animals were dosed with either DMF formulated 
in 0.8% aqueous hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (in mice, rats and monkeys) or the clinical capsule 
(in dogs). 
Oral tolerability 
Oral tolerability was tested using DMF as a suspension or as a capsule. In rats, oral tolerability was 
below  500  mg/kg.    In  dogs,  oral  administration  of  DMF  as  a  suspension  was  limited  to  less  than 
100 mg/kg due to persistent emesis.  As an oral capsule, dogs administered DMF at 75 mg/kg/day 
presented  with  persistent emesis  and  body  weight  loss, resulting  in  reducing  the  high  dose  to  50 
mg/kg/day at day 7 in the 11 month study.  In monkeys, 75 mg/kg/day was the oral MTD for DMF. 
Laboratory findings 
In  dogs,  changes  in  haematological  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  as  well  as  reduced  thymus 
weights  with  lymphoid  atrophy  were  seen  at  ≥ 50 mg/kg/day  DMF  in  the  28 day  study.  In  this 
study,  a  pronounced  decrease  in  body  weight  and  food  consumption  was  also  noted  in  animals. 
This  may  have  contributed  to  the observed  changes. In  addition,  reversible  signs  of  anaemia  and 
increased extramedullary haematopoiesis were detected at ≥ 200 mg/kg/day in the 13 week study 
in mice and sporadic but significant alterations in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters 
were noted at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day in the 3 months study in rats. These alterations were considered as 
incidental findings. 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 20/126 
 
  
  
  
Renal findings 
The kidney was clearly identified as target organ of DMF toxicity in all four species tested in toxicity 
studies:  mice,  rats,  dogs,  and  monkeys.  These  effects  have  been  observed  at  low  doses,  without 
any  safety  margin  towards  human  therapeutic  doses.  In  mice,  increase  in  kidney  weights  was 
noted.  In  rats,  nephrotoxicity  was  observed  in  repeat-dose  studies  (4  week,  3  and  6  months).  In 
the  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice,  nephrotoxicity  was  also  seen.  In  dogs, 
hypertrophy and regeneration of the cortical tubular epithelium were noted in males, whereas both 
sexes revealed dilation of cortical tubules, atrophy of the cortical parenchyma, infiltration of mixed 
inflammatory cells in the renal papilla and hyperplasia of papillary urothelial cells. These alterations 
were observed at all dosages and were still evident in one or more animals per DMF-treated group 
at  the  end  of  the  recovery  period.  In  monkeys,  kidney  alterations  corresponded  to  single  cell 
necrosis and regeneration of the cortical tubular epithelial cells with a higher incidence and severity 
in the 75 mg/kg/day group. These DMF-related changes were similarly present in animals of the 25 
and 75 mg/kg groups at the end of the recovery period. Mild to moderate interstitial renal fibrosis 
were  also  noted  at  recovery  necropsy,  indicative  of  irreversible  loss  of  tissue  and  function, 
accompanied  by  cortical  tubular  atrophy  in  male  monkeys  of  the  high  dose  group. These  findings 
were associated with increases of BUN by 42-77 % and of creatinine by 22-56% in one animal.   
Forestomach findings 
In  mice  and  rats,  the  forestomach  (non-glandular  stomach)  has  been  identified  as  a  target  organ 
for  DMF  toxicity.  This  effect  was  observed  at  all  doses  administered  across  the  toxicology  studies 
performed  in  these  species,  including  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies.    Common  findings  were 
increased  stomach  weights,  hyperplasia,  hyperkeratosis,  inflammation,  and  ulceration  which  a 
trend for reversal.  In rats, squamous cell carcinoma was observed in the forestomach of one of 30 
males  and  one  of  30  females  that  had  received  250  mg/kg  DMF  for  3  months.  In  addition, 
literature data suggested that activation of the Nrf2 pathway may induce severe hyperkeratosis in 
the oesophagus and forestomach of mice (Motohashi et al, 2004). It is known that the forestomach 
lacks a clear anatomical counterpart in non-rodent species including humans, although it is covered 
by  oesophageal-type  mucosa  (Wester  and  Kroes,  1988).  Nevertheless,  food  normally  passes 
quickly through the oesophagus, hence contrasting its potentially prolonged residence in the rodent 
forestomach.  In  dogs,  increased  stomach  erosions  were  determined  in  the  28 day  study  at 
250 mg/kg/day  DMF,  which  were  not  confirmed  after  chronic  dosing  of  either the  DMF  capsule  or 
HPMC  formulation  in  dogs  and  monkeys,  respectively.  No  oesophagus  findings  were  observed  in 
other toxicity studies in dogs and monkeys. 
Liver findings 
Hepatic  effects  were  observed  in  the  following  species:  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  Changes  in  liver 
function  tests  (LFTs)  were  not  observed.  However,  no  safety  margins  toward  therapeutic  human 
doses  could  be  established.  Liver  to  brain  weight  ratios  were  dose-dependently  increased  in  the 
3 months studies in mice (≥ 200 mg/kg/day) and rats (250 mg/kg/day) as well as in the 11 months 
study  in  dogs  (≥ 50 mg/kg/day).  In  rats,  minimal  multifocal  hepatic  necrosis  and  bile  duct 
hyperplasia  were  additionally  observed  in  the  6  month  study,  predominantly  females  of  the  100 
and  200 mg/kg/day  groups.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  minimal  hepatic  necrosis  was  still 
present in females at a lower incidence, whereas the bile duct hyperplasia completely reversed.  
Testis findings 
In  the  11  month  study  in  dogs,  males  showed  decreased  weights  of  testis  and  epididymis  at  the 
75/50 mg/kg/day  level.  In  addition,  degeneration  of  the  seminiferous  tubular  epithelium  and 
presence  of  spermatid  giant  cells  in  the  lumen  of  the  seminiferous  tubules  were  noted  at  25  and 
75/50 mg/kg/day  dosages  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  period,  which  could  still  be  detected  with 
decreased  incidence  and/or  severity  at  the  end  of  the  recovery  phase.  In  the  epididymides, 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 21/126 
 
  
  
  
hypospermia was observed in high dose males. DMF exposures as compared to human dose were 
approximately  3-and  7  fold  higher  and  for  hypospermia  and  epididymis,  respectively,  which  were 
considered  sufficient  safety  margins.  Concomitantly,  a  pronounced  decrease  in  body  weight  and 
food  consumption  was  also  noted  in  these  animals.  This  may  have  contributed  to  the  observed 
changes, because spermatogenesis in dogs has been reported to be non-specifically suppressed by 
starvation (Russell, 1990). 
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The  mutagenicity  and  clastogenicity  of  DMF  and  MMF  were  evaluated  using  the  standard  test 
battery according to ICHS2A and B guidelines: Ames test in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in 
CHO  cells  and  human  lymphocytes  in  vitro  and  rat  micronucleus  test  in  vivo.  All  of  these  studies 
had negative results. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
The  oncogenic  potential  of  DMF  was  assessed  in  mice  and  rats  following  oral administration  for  2 
years. Toxicities on the kidneys and forestomach observed in the previous toxicology studies were 
confirmed in these species.  
In  mice,  neoplasias  of  the  non-glandular  forestomach  were  significantly  increased  at  200  and 
400 mg/kg/day and slightly but not significantly at 75 mg/kg/day. Kidney tubular carcinomas were 
significantly  increased  in  males  at  200  and  400  mg/kg/day,,  while  adenomas  were  significantly 
increased in high dose females at 400 mg/kg/day. There was a slight but not significant increase in 
tubular  carcinomas  already  in  males  of the  75  mg/kg/  day  group.  Males  were  also  positive  in the 
trend test for adenoma and carcinoma and females for adenoma. 
In  rats,  hyperplasia  of  squamous  epithelium  of  the  forestomach  with  dose-dependent  increase  in 
squamous  cell  papilloma  and  carcinoma  were  detected.  In  addition,  dose-dependent  increases  in 
epithelial  degeneration  and  mineralization  were  observed  in  the  glandular  stomach  of  male  and 
female  rats  and  chronic  inflammation  in  males.  Kidney  tubular  carcinomas  were  also  significantly 
increased in the 150 mg/kg/day high dose group in female rats, whereas renal tubular adenomas 
were  found  in  males  of  this  group  with  positive  trend  test.  A  slight but  not  significant  increase  in 
tubular carcinomas was already detected in female rats at 100 mg/kg/day. 
In both mice and rats, a treatment and dose-related shift to chronic progressive nephropathy was 
observed in males and females.  
2.3.4.5.  Reproduction Toxicity 
The effect of DMF on fertility, early embryonic and peri and post-natal development was assessed 
in male and female rats and in female rabbits. 
In  male  rats,  histopathological  changes  were  observed  in  the  testes  at  all  doses  tested  in  the 
fertility  study.  These  effects  included  minimal  to  mild  multifocal  interstitial-(Leydig)  cell 
hyperplasia.  Testicular  changes  were  also  observed  in  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats, 
testicular Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenomas, and in the 11 month study in dogs, seminiferous 
tubule  degeneration,  spermatid  giant  cells  and  hypospermia  of  the  epididymides  (see  2.3.4.2). 
However, DMF had no effect on sperm count/motility or on fertility in male rats up to the highest 
dose tested (375 mg/kg). In  female rats, the average number of estrous stages per 14 days was 
significantly reduced and the number of rats with prolonged diestrus was increased at the highest 
dose  tested  (250mg/kg),  the  female  fertility  and  number  of  viable  foetuses  produced  were  not 
affected at this dose level. 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 22/126 
 
  
  
  
In female rats and rabbits, MMF was shown to cross the placental membrane into foetal blood with 
a  ratio  of  foetal  to  maternal  plasma  concentrations  of  0.48  to  0.64  and  0.1,  respectively.  In  the 
embryo-foetal  development  study  in  rats,  maternal  NOAEL  was  determined  as  25  mg/kg  due  to 
maternal weight loss and reduced body weight gain.  The developmental NOAEL was determined to 
be  100  mg/kg  due  to  generally  delayed  foetal  development  as  evident  by  decreases  in  foetal 
weight  and  increases  in  foetal  alterations  that  were  observed  at  higher  exposures  (delayed 
ossification  in  metatarsals  and  hindlimb  phalanges).    In  the  embryo-foetal  development  study  in 
rabbits, four abortions were seen in the high dose group and maternal NOAEL was considered to be 
25  mg/kg.  No  foetal  developmental effects  were  observed.  The  developmental  NOAEL  was  ≥  150 
mg/kg/day. No foetal malformations were noted in rats and rabbits. 
In  the  pre-  and  postnatal  development  study  in  pregnant  and  lactating  rats,  DMF  effects  were 
limited to reduced body weights, and body weight gain.  There was also a reduction in pup weights 
in  the  high  dose  group,  and  further  evidence  of  stomach  adverse  effects  were  confirmed.    As  a 
result a NOAEL for maternal effects was determined as 25 mg/kg.  No increased mortality due to 
DMF  was  observed.    A  NOAEL  for  viability  and  growth  in  the  offspring  was  determined  as  100 
mg/kg due to reduction in pup body weights, and delays in sexual maturation in male rats at 250 
mg/kg. 
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  data  on  MMF  was  collected  from  all  repeat-dose  toxicology  and  the  two  year 
carcinogenicity studies with daily or BID (only dogs) administration, previously described. MMF was 
rapidly absorbed and eliminated in mice (Tmax < 10 min; t 1/2  < 35 min), rats (Tmax 25-45 min; t 1/2 
≤ 60 min), rabbits (Tmax  25-42 min; t 1/2 ≤ 48 min), dogs (Tmax < 0.5 to 4 h; t1/2 40 - 49 min) and 
monkeys  (Tmax  < 1 h;  t 1/2 0.6  –  1.6 h).  In  addition,  MMF  levels  generally  increased  in  a  dose-
proportional manner. No relevant accumulation or gender differences were apparent in mice, dogs 
and monkeys. In contrast, female rats revealed higher MMF levels than males (by 8 % to 41 %). 
In monkeys, potentially toxic DMF metabolites methanol and formic acid were studied. After half of 
the  chronic  toxicity  study (Week 26),  methanol  AUC0-24h  was  approximately  40 %  higher in  males 
of the 25 mg/kg group than in controls, and was present in both sexes at 75 mg/kg. At Week 52, 
methanol AUC0-24h remained elevated to a smaller extent (~12 %) in males of the 75 mg/kg group, 
and  not  detectable in  all  other  tested  doses.  No  relevant  differences  were  noted  regarding  formic 
acid exposure after DMF treatment. 
2.3.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
No studies were performed by the applicant since the product is for oral use. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No antigenicity, immunotoxicity and dependence studies were performed by the applicant and this 
was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  given  the  claimed  mechanism  of  action  and  findings  in 
repeat  dose  toxicity  studied  in  4  different  species.  In  addition,  impurities  were  not  studied  since 
these  are  considered  metabolites  of  DMF  and  hence  already  qualified in  the toxicological  program 
of DMF. 
In rats, additional toxicity studies were performed with DMF treatment for up to 75 days to further 
evaluate  the  potential  of  DMF  to  induce  renal  toxicity.  The  following  parameters  were  measured: 
kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and urinary albumin as  complementary renal biomarkers to BUN 
and  CREA  levels  for  detection  of  tubular  changes  in  the  kidney,  urinary  total  protein  and 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 23/126 
 
  
  
  
β2-microglobulin  level  for  identification  of  glomeruli  damage  and  impairment  of  tubular 
reabsorption (Dieterle et al., 2010). Elevated levels of urinary albumin were found to be associated 
with  the  renal  tubular  changes  observed  after  DMF  treatment,  whereas  increases  of  Ki-67  were 
noted, possibly indicating enhanced proliferation due to regeneration. However, KIM-1 could not be 
clearly  correlated  with  DMF-mediated  nephrotoxicity  and  the  short  duration  of  these  studies 
precluded  manifestation  of  severe  DMF-related  renal  effects,  which  were  evident  in  previously 
described toxicology studies. 
Combination  studies  were  also  submitted  to  further  support  the  toxicology  profile  of  DMF.  Animal 
toxicity  findings  using  DMF  in  combination  with  methotrexate  were  similar  to  the  one  observed 
using  DMF  alone.  No  exacerbation  of  these  toxicities  was  noted  after  combination  with 
methotrexate.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In pharmacology studies, DMF and its primary active metabolite MMF were both able to trigger the 
activation  of  the  Nrf2  antioxidant  pathway.  This  mechanism  is  claimed  to  be  associated  with 
neuroprotective properties.  
In  the  EAE  models  of  MS  in  rats,  DMF  showed  beneficial  effects  on  demyelination  and  cellular 
degeneration  and  improved  neurological  deficits.  In  addition,  in  vivo  studies  indicated  that  DMF 
may  act  by  reducing  excitotoxic  lesion  volume  and  improving  neuronal  survival  and  functional 
outcome.  However,  the  overall  mechanism  of  action  of  DMF  on  MS  is  not  fully  understood.  DMF 
was  also  found  to  exert  anti-inflammatory  activities  by  reducing  inflammatory  cell  infiltration  and 
inhibiting  the  induction  of  inflammatory  cytokines  and  activation  of  astrocytes,  macrophages  and 
microglia.

No clinically relevant findings were evident in the safety pharmacology studies. 
The  results  of  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  animal  showed:  rapid  oral  absorption,  extensive 
tissue  distribution,  very  low  protein  binding  and  elimination  by  exhalation  of  CO2.  MMF,  the  main 
DMF  metabolite,  crosses  the  placental  membrane  into  fetal  blood.  It  is  not  known  whether  DMF 
drug material is excreted in milk. 
Repeated  dose  studies  identified  the  kidneys,  forestomach  and  liver  as  main  target  organs  for 
toxicity in animals.  
Nephrotoxicity  was  detected  in  four  different  animal  species  and  included  renal  tubule  epithelial 
regeneration  suggestive  of  injury.  Such  toxicity  was  also  associated  with  renal  tubular  adenomas 
and carcinomas in mice and rats (see below). Increased liver weights were detected in mice, rats 
and  dogs.  Minimal  multifocal  hepatic  necrosis  and  bile  duct  hyperplasia  were  also  noted  in  rats. 
Given  that  no  safety  margins  towards intended  therapeutic levels  in  humans  could  be  established 
across  species  (rats,  dogs  and  monkeys),  these  findings  were  considered  of  potential  clinical 
relevance.  Findings  in  the  forestomach  of  mice  and  rats  consisted  of  squamous  epithelial 
hyperplasia  and  hyperkeratosis,  inflammation,  and  squamous  cell  papilloma  and  carcinoma  in 
studies of 3 months or longer in duration. These findings were considered not relevant to humans, 
given the fact that the forestomach lacks a clear anatomical counterpart in non-rodent species and 
also considering the gastro-resistant pharmaceutical formulation applied for.  
In  the  testes,  degeneration  of  the  seminiferous  epithelium  was  seen  in  rats  and  dogs.  Moreover, 
testicular  interstitial  (Leydig)  cell  hyperplasia  and  adenomas  were  found  in  the  2-year 
carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  at doses  ≥ 100 mg/kg.  The  findings  were  observed  at  approximately 
the recommended dose in rats and 6 times the recommended dose in dogs (AUC basis). However, 
no effects were seen in the fertility study or upon chronic dosing in rats, as well as upon long-term 
dosing  in  mice  (2 years)  and  monkeys  (12 months).  In  addition,  Leydig  cell  tumours  in  rats  are 
commonly  regarded  to  rely  on  exaggerated  levels  of  luteinizing  hormone,  a  mechanism  to  which 
humans appear to be relatively insensitive. This might explain the rarity of this type of tumour in 
humans including its absence in the clinical program of DMF and during post-marketing experience 
with  Fumaderm  as  an  oral  treatment  of psoriasis.  In  contrast,  the  testes  findings  in  dogs  showed 
reduced  severity  and  incidence  during  the  recovery  phase  and  were  attributed  to  the  pronounced 
effect of DMF on body weight and food consumption, which required extra dietary supplementation. 
Moreover, a generally high background rate of spontaneous testicular lesions (20-30 %) has been 
determined  in  young  dogs  assigned  to  toxicology  studies  (Goedken,  2008).  Thus,  the  testes 
findings in both species were considered of limited relevance to humans.  
Carcinogenicity studies up to 2 years did show an increased incidence of renal tubular carcinoma in 
rats and mice confirming findings from repeated toxicity data. Contrary to the applicant view, the 
CHMP  was  not  in  agreement  that  these  data  were  possibly  due  to  exacerbation  of  age-related, 
species-specific rodent nephropathy.  
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in a standard package of tests. 
In  male  rats,  DMF  had  no  effect  on  sperm  count/motility  or  on  fertility  in  male  up  to  the  highest 
dose tested (375 mg/kg). In  female rats, the average number of estrous stages per 14 days was 
significantly reduced and the number of rats with prolonged diestrus was increased at the highest 
dose  tested  (250mg/kg),  the  female  fertility  and  number  of  viable  foetuses  produced  were  not 
affected  at  this  dose  level.  In  female  rats  and  rabbits,  MMF  was  shown  to  cross  the  placental 
membrane into foetal blood with a ratio of foetal to maternal plasma concentrations of 0.48 to 0.64 
and  0.1,  respectively.  In  the  embryo-foetal  development  study  in  rats,  maternal  NOAEL  was 
determined  as  25  mg/kg  due  to  reduced  maternal  body  weight  and  body  weight  gain.    The 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 26/126 
 
  
  
  
 
developmental  NOAEL  was  determined  to  be  100  mg/kg  due  to  generally  delayed  foetal 
development as evident by decreases in foetal weight and increases in foetal alterations that were 
observed at higher exposures (delayed ossification in metatarsals and hindlimb phalanges).  In the 
embryo-foetal development study in rabbits, four abortions were seen in the high dose group and 
maternal NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg/kg.  No foetal developmental effects were observed. 
The development NOAEL was ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. No malformations were noted in rats and rabbits. 
In  the  pre-and  postnatal  development  study,  DMF  effects  were  limited  to  reduced  body  weights, 
and  body  weight  gain.    There  was  also  a  reduction  in  pup  weights  in  the  high  dose  group,  and 
further  evidence  of  stomach  adverse  effects  were  confirmed.    As  a  result  a  NOAEL  for  maternal 
effects was determined as 25 mg/kg.  No increased mortality due to DMF was observed. A NOAEL 
for viability and growth in the offspring was determined as 100 mg/kg due to reduction in pup body 
weights,  and  delays  in  sexual  maturation  in  male  rats  at  250  mg/kg.  These  reproductive  toxicity 
findings were considered adequately described in the SmPC. 
On the basis of the ERA data, the CHMP concluded that DMF is not expected to pose a risk for the 
environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  aspects  of  DMF  have  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the 
requirements to support this application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The phase I clinical pharmacology programme has been conducted using single or multiple doses of 
DMF,  in  healthy  volunteers  and  MS  subjects  (including  alcohol  consumers).  In  total,  210  subjects 
were  exposed  to  a  single  oral  dose  of  DMF  ranging  from  120  to  360  mg  DMF,  and    149  subjects 
were exposed to repeated oral doses of DMF, including 48 patients with MS.  
Concentrations  of  DMF  and  its  analysed  metabolites  (e.g  MMF,  fumaric  acid)  were  measured  in 
plasma  using  HPLC-UV  assay  and  LC-MS/MS  methods  in  the  PK  studies.  Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined using non compartmental models. 
Absorption  
Absolute  bioavailability  of  DMF  and  MMF  has  not  been  evaluated.  In  a  few  healthy  subjects,  the 
absorption of DMF was rapid as the maximum plasma concentrations of DMF-derived radioactivity 
occurred  with  one  hour.  Less  than  1%  of  the  total  administered  radioactivity  was  found  in  the 
faeces  indicating  that  the  drug  was  essentially  completely  absorbed.    The  enteric-coating  of  the 
microtablets  has  shown  to  delay  the  onset  of  absorption  and  slow  the  overall  rate  of  absorption 
resulting in a longer lag time, however Cmax of MMF is increased about 40%. 
Prolonged lag time and Tmax were also noted with food intake, from 0.25-0.75 h to 2 to 2.5 h and 
from  2-2.5  h  to  4-6  h  intervals,  respectively.  Under  fed  conditions,  Cmax  decreased  and  a  slight 
increased  AUC,  suggesting  no  clinically  significant  effect  on  exposure  of  DMF,  when  taken  with 
food.  These  findings  appeared  to  be  correlated  with  a  lower  AE  incidence,  when  compared  to 
fasting state, notably for flushing events, 94% versus 68%.  
PK  data  after  single  and  multiple  dosing  were  characterised  by  a  high  degree  of  inter-individual 
variability  and  irregular  shape.  Although  the  applicant  has  performed  an  extensive  programme  of 
physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  simulations  to  support  a  better  understanding  of  the  high 
inter-subject  variability  in  the  PK  profile  of  BG00012, further  investigation  on  the  model  and  its 
mechanistic background is recommended by including different transit times of the particles and a 
more thorough matching of in vitro to in vivo dissolution profiles.   
In MS subjects, the median Tmax values for MMF were 5 hours (BID) and 7.5 hours (TID), whereas 
the  median  Cmax  values  were  1.72  mg/L  (BID)  and  1.93 mg/L  (TID).   The  overall  MMF  exposure 
was  dose  proportional  with  median  AUC(0-24)  values  of  8.02 h.mg/L  (BID)  and  12.3  h.mg/L 
(TID). The MMF concentrations returned to below detection at the end of the 24-hour dosing period 
before  the  first  dose  on  the  next  day,  and  no  accumulation  was  observed  on  a  daily  basis  with  4 
days  of  dosing.  The  lack  of  carry-over  concentrations  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  period,  and  the 
reproducibility of the PK profiles over the 24-hour dosing cycle with both the BID and TID regimens 
for up to 4 days, indicated that the PK of BG00012 is unchanged with multiple dosing.

Distribution 
In  healthy  subjects,  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  after  administration  of  BG00012  240mg 
was  64.07  L  (23.870)  and  72.69  L  (43.521)  with  BG00012  360  mg,  in  the  fasted  state.  In  MS 
patients who received BG00012 240 mg BID or TID with food, the apparent volume of distribution 
was  134.58  L  and  117.02  L.  MMF  did  not  preferentially  partition  or  sequester  into  the  cellular 
components of blood and red blood cells, red blood cell to plasma partition coefficients and whole 
blood to plasma partition coefficients  were  <1. Human plasma protein binding of DMF was in the 
58%  -  69%  range  at  the  doses  of  10,5  and  1.25  µg/mL.  MMF  had  a  lower  range  of  binding  in 
plasma of approximately 30 to 40 %. 
Elimination 
Exhalation of CO2 was found as the primary route of dimethyl fumarate elimination accounting for 
60% of the dose. Renal and faecal elimination were secondary routes of elimination, accounting for 
15.5% and 0.9% of the dose respectively. 
The terminal half-life of MMF was generally short in the 0.5-1.2 h. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality for AUC was confirmed in single and multiple dose studies across the 120 mg 
to 360 mg dose range studied. Although inter-subject variability was observed for Cmax, this was 
considered  not  clinically  significant.  Potential  covariates  (gastric  PH,  sex,  age,  weight  and  food 
intake),  affecting  the  exposure,  did  not  influence  safety  and  efficacy  outcomes  in  subgroup  of 
patients included in Phase III studies. 
There was no accumulation following multiple dosing. 
Special populations 
No specific studies have been conducted in special populations.  
Gender and age had a marginal impact on Cmax only, suggesting no clinically significant impact on 
the pharmacokinetics of DMF.  
No relevant effect of alcohol consumption was found, when taken with DMF.  However, the release 
of drug may be accelerated in the presence of alcohol.  
Since  the  renal  pathway  is  a  secondary  route  of  elimination  for  dimethyl  fumarate  accounting  for 
less  than  16% of  the  dose  administered,  evaluation  of  pharmacokinetics  in  subjects  with  renal 
impairment was not conducted.  
As  dimethyl  fumarate  and  monomethyl  fumarate  are  metabolised  by  esterases,  without  the 
involvement  of  the  CYP450  system,  evaluation  of  phamacokinetics  in  subjects  with  hepatic 
impairment was not conducted. However considering the presence of cysteine and N-acetylcysteine 
conjugates in urine, the mechanism of metabolic conversion of MMF remains unclear. An effect of 
hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetic of DMF cannot therefore be completely ruled out. 
Based  on  the  results  of  Analysis  of  Variance  (ANOVA),  body  weight  is  the  main  covariate  of 
exposure (by Cmax and AUC) in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects, but did not 
affect safety and efficacy outcomes in subgroup of patients included in Phase III studies.

No data are available in the paediatric population as the clinical study included in the PIP has been 
deferred. The elderly population was also not studied and no data are available. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The  potential  interactions  were  studied  in  humans  for  the  following  drugs:  glatiramer,  interferon 
beta-1a.  
In  addition,  an  interaction  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  safety,  tolerability,  and 
pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  different  doses  and  dosing  regimens  of  BG00012  administered  with  and 
without non enteric coated acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to placebo in healthy subjects.  
When  co-administered  with  interferon  beta-1a  30  μg  IM  injection,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 
oral BG00012 240 mg TID was not affected. However, an increased AEs reporting was noted using 
the combination : 71% subjects in the group receiving BG00012 alone reported AEs as compared 
to  100  %  subjects  in  the  group  receiving  both  BG00012  and  interferon  beta-1a.  Similar  findings 
were noted in the interaction study evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of BG0012 240 mg TID, 
when co-administered with glatiramer 20 mg SC injection. No relevant pharmacokinetic interaction 
was found, however, one  subject was withdrawn from the study after receiving BG00012 with GA 
due to mild nausea and 84% of subjects who received BG00012 alone reported an adverse event 
compared to 92 % of subjects who received the combination BG00012 plus GA.. 
325  mg  of  acetylsalicylic  acid,  when  administered  approximately  30  minutes  before  BG00012  at 
doses ranging from 240 mg BID to 360 mg TID, and at 120 mg every hour for 3 consecutive hours 
in the morning and again in the evening, had no effect on the PK profile of BG00012. 
No  interaction  study  was  performed  with  oral  contraceptives,  given  DMF  lack  of  interactions  with 
CYPs.  However  the  CHMP  considered  it  necessary  to  complement  the  available  in  vitro  data  by  a 
clinical study, in view of the reproductivity toxicity findings (see 2.3.4.5).  The SmPC of DMF is not 
recommending oral contraceptives as a method of birth control. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In  vitro  studies  did  not  suggest inhibition  properties  for  DMF  or  MMF  on  the  following  CYPs:  2D6, 
3A4,  2B6,  2C8,  1A2,  2C9,  2C19  and  2E1.  No  inducing  effect  was  also  observed  on  the  following 
CYPs:  1A2,  2B6,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19  and  3A4.  MMF  was  not  found  to  act  as  an  inhibitor  of  several 
studied transporters (Pgp, BCRP, or BSEP OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, 
and MATE2K).  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Two clinical studies further investigated the claimed mechanism of action of DMF via activation of 
the NrF2 antioxidant pathway. These included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and RRMS. 
In  RA  patients,  the  median  NAD(P)H  dehydrogenase  quinone  1,  NQO-1  levels  (adjusted  for 
housekeeping gene beta-2 microglobulin [B2M]) were increased at both Weeks 2 and 12 compared 
to  the  placebo  group,  and  the  increases  at  Week  12  were  statistically  significant:  36.4%  change 
from  baseline  BG00012  TID  versus  -1.6%  placebo.  In  the  BG00012  BID  group,  there  was  a 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 30/126 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
statistically  significant  increase  in  NQO-1  level  at  Week  12  (18.3%  change  from  baseline  versus 
1.6% placebo).  No significant changes were observed for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). 
In RRMS patients, median percent change in NQO-1 levels relative to baseline  were upregulated at 
both Week 12 and Week 48 compared to the placebo group, and both increases were statistically 
significant: 15.6% and 14.0% change from baseline in BG00012 BID group versus 4.5% and 0.0% 
placebo  group  at  Weeks  12  and  48  respectively,  and  29.0%  and  13.1%  change  from  baseline  in 
BG00012 TID group versus (vs) 4.5% and 0.0% placebo group at Weeks 12 and 48, respectively. 
No significant change was seen for HO-1. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic  effects  of  DMF  on  the  heart  have  been  investigated  in  healthy  subjects.  In 
addition,  the  potential  cause  of  BG00012-mediated  flushing  and  GI  symptoms  was  evaluated  by 
examining the effect on concentrations of PGD2 and/or its metabolites in plasma and/or urine and 
other  prostaglandins,  as  well  as  other  biomarkers  (e.g.,  serotonin  and  histamine,  and  tumor 
necrosis  factor  or  TNFα)  in  psoriasis  and  healthy  subjects  with/  without  pre-treatment  with  ASA. 
Some of these studies were previously discussed in relation to the pharmacokinetic profile of DMF.  
In  a  specific  study  in  healthy  volunteers,  single  doses  of  BG00012  240  mg  and  360  mg,  did  not 
reveal any significant differences in the QTc interval, when compared to placebo. 
In psoriasis subjects, an increase in PGD2 and PGF2α levels was observed during the flush for both 
groups, one treated with a single oral dose of 240 mg BG00012, the other taking an oral dose of 
120  mg  BG00012  TID  .  Plasma  serotonin  concentrations  also  increased  for  both  groups.  The 
plasma levels of histamine and TNFα were not influenced by the occurrence of flushing. 
In  healthy  subjects  taking  325  mg  ASA  (30  minutes  prior  to  BG00012  administration),  the 
incidence  and  intensity  of  flushing  were  reduced.  In  this  study,  flushing  was  related  to  MMF 
exposure, but a clear association between the severity of flushing and serum levels of MMF was not 
established. For all treatment groups, the incidence of flushing AEs was highest on Day 1 of dosing 
and decreased over time. Most subjects had flushing episodes on 2 or 3 days of dosing, and only a 
few  patients  had  flushing  on  all  4  days  of  dosing.  Mean  Global  Flushing  Severity  Scale  (GFSS) 
scores were mild for all groups throughout the study; these were highest on Day 2 (following Day 1 
dosing)  and  decreased  over  time  for  all  treatment  groups.  Overall  FSS  scores  for  all  treatment 
groups  were  mild,  were  highest  on  Day  1,  and  decreased  over  time.  The  low  incidence  and  mild 
scores for the GI effects measured by Overall GI Symptom Scale (OGISS), the Acute GI Symptom 
Scale  (AGIS),  and  the  Bowel  Movement  Questionnaire  (BMQ)  precluded  definitive  conclusions 
regarding the relationship between PK parameters and GI symptoms.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  (absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  elimination)  of  DMF  was 
characterised  by  a  high  degree  of  inter-individual  variability  and  irregular  shape.  This  may  be 
related to stomach transit differences, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood 
(see  2.4.5).  DMF  did  not  seem  to  interact  with  several  CYPs  and  transporters  (including  P-gp), 
suggesting minimal role of the liver on its metabolism. 
Using the enteric coated microtablets, a delay of onset and slow rate of absorption was achieved, 
thus  improving  the  tolerability  profile  of  DMF,  considering  the  product  is  associated  with  GI  and 
flushing events (see 2.6).  
Under  fed  conditions,  Cmax  decreased  and  a  slight  increased  AUC  was  noted,  suggesting    no 
clinically significant effect on exposure of DMF, when taken with food. These findings appeared to 
be  correlated  with  a  lower  AE  incidence,  when  compared  to  fasting  state,  notably  for  flushing 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 31/126 
 
  
  
  
events.  The  SmPC  of  DMF  recommends  that  it  should  be  taken  with  food  due  to  improved 
tolerability with respect to these AEs. 
There  was  no  indication  of  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  BG00012  between  MS 
patients and healthy volunteers. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the 120 mg and the 240 mg capsules in the fasted 
state.   
No specific studies have been conducted in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Considering 
that DMF is primarily metabolised via esterases and does not appear to involve CYP450 system or 
renal pathway as a main route of elimination, the absence of those studies were accepted and no 
dose  adjustments  are  recommended  for  these  patients.  However,  considering  the  presence  of 
cysteine and N-acetylcysteine conjugates in urine, the mechanism of metabolic conversion of MMF 
remains unclear. An effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetic of DMF cannot therefore 
be completely ruled out. The CHMP therefore recommended to include a warning for patients with 
severe  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  as  a  precautionary  measure.  In  addition,  long  term  data  is 
intended  to  be  collected  in  the  observational  study  to  monitor  the  safety  profile  in  these  patients 
(see 2.6). 
No data are available in the paediatric population as the clinical study included in the PIP has been 
deferred. The elderly population was also not studied and there was a limited exposure to patients 
aged  55  years  or  above.  Age  had  a  marginal  impact  on  Cmax  only,  suggesting  no  clinically 
significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of DMF. No dosage adjustment is  recommended for the 
elderly population. 
No relevant effect of alcohol consumption was found, when taken with DMF.  However, the release 
of drug may be accelerated in the presence of alcohol. Such information has been included in the 
SmPC, given the occurrence of GI events, which may be increased in case of consumption of large 
quantities of undiluted strong alcoholic drinks, defined as more than 30% alcohol by volume. 
When co-administered with either interferon beta-1a and glatiramer, the pharmacokinetic profile of 
DMF was not altered, however an increased AE reporting was noted. 
No  in  vivo  interaction  study  was  performed  with  oral  contraceptives,  in  the  absence  of  in  vitro 
interactions  with  CYPs.  However  the  CHMP  considered  necessary  to  complement  these  data  by  a 
clinical study, in view of the reproductivity toxicity findings (see 2.3.4.5).  The SmPC of DMF is not 
recommending oral contraceptives as method of birth control.  
In addition, in view of safety profile observed in the main RRMS studies (see 2.6), the absence of 
interaction studies with anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies, vaccines is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Single doses of DMF did not affect the QTc interval. 
In  psoriasis  subjects,  an  increase  in  PGD2  and  PGF2α  levels  was  observed  during  the  flush, 
however,  the  plasma  levels  of  histamine  was  not  influenced  by  the  occurrence  of  flushing, 
suggesting that hypersensitivity is unlikely to play a main role.  
In  healthy  volunteer  subjects,  administration  of  325  mg  ASA,  30  minutes  prior  to  BG00012 
reduced flushing severity and further supported a prostaglandin-mediated flushing mechanism. No 
conclusions  could  be  drawn  on  the  mechanistic  profile  of  the  GI  events,  given  their  low  incidence 
during  the  study.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  data  are  still  limited  and  the  underlying 
mechanism  of  flushing  and  GI  events  is  not  completely  understood.  Results  on  an  ongoing  dose 
titration  study  with  ASA  are  awaited  to  further  address  this  issue,  although  the  CHMP  noted  that 
additional investigations may need to be considered on the basis of the expected data.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of DMF in human studies has been adequately characterised 
for  its  intended  use.  The  CHMP  considered  necessary  to  address  the  missing  information  on 
interaction with oral contraceptives as part of the risk management plan (see 2.8). 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAH  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following point for further investigation: 
- To further investigate the model used to understand the high inter-subject variability in the PK 
profile  of  BG00012   and  its  mechanistic  background  by  including  different  transit  times  of  the 
particles and a more thorough matching of in vitro to in vivo dissolution profiles.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The following indication was initially applied for: disease modifying therapy in adult patients with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of relapses and to delay the progression of 
disability. 
The clinical development program comprises the following clinical studies: 
- a phase II, 48 week (1 year), multicenter, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study (C-1900) evaluating efficacy and safety of DMF versus placebo in  patients with 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. This study included two parts: a 24-week double-blind, 
placebo-controlled safety and efficacy phase (Part 1) followed by a 24-week dose-blinded, safety 
extension phase (Part 2). 
- a phase III, 96 week (2 years), multicenter  double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study (109MS301)  evaluating the efficacy and safety of BG00012 240 mg BID and 
240 mg TID administered orally versus placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis. 
- a phase III, 96 week (2 years), multicenter  double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study (109MS302)  evaluating the efficacy and safety of BG00012 240 mg BID and 
240 mg TID administered orally versus placebo and glatiramer acetate in patients with relapsing-
remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Another study (109MS303) is currently ongoing. The study is   a multicenter, randomised, dose 
blind, parallel group, 5 year extension study  evaluating the long term efficacy and safety of 
BG00012 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID administered orally in patients with relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
One  dose  ranging  study  (C-1900)  using  either  120  mg  QD  BG00012  (120  mg),  120  mg  TID 
BG00012  (360  mg),  240  mg  TID  BG00012  (720  mg)  was  performed  including  a  total  number  of 
randomised patients of 257 patients (n=64 for each of the DMF groups, n=65 for placebo group). 
During the double blind placebo controlled phase, all patients from the 240 mg TID group received 
BG00012 120 mg TID for 1 week and then increased to 240 mg TID for the remainder of dosing. 
During  the  dose-blinded,  safety  extension  phase,  all  patients  who  received  BG00012  in  Part  1 
continued on the same dosing regimen, while patients who received placebo in Part 1 switched to 
BG00012  120  mg  TID  escalating  to  240  mg  TID  after  1  week.  The  population  studied  had  RRMS 
with  a  rather  mild  disease  form  with  a  median  baseline  Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale  (EDSS) 
score  of  2.5  and  a  median  number  of  relapses  in  the  last  year  of  1.0.  The  majority  (64%)  were 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 33/126 
 
  
  
  
women,  and  of  Caucasian  race  (98%).  The  mean  age  was  around  36,  the  mean  duration  of  the 
disease was 6 years. 
Analyses  on  MRI  endpoints  (primary/secondary)  were  performed  in  the  Efficacy  Evaluable  (EE) 
population. The ITT population was used for the analysis on clinical endpoints (secondary) such as 
the ARR and disability progression as measured by the EDSS score.  
The  highest  dose,  240  mg  TID  of  BG00012  showed  statistically  significant  differences  in 
comparison  to  placebo  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  total  number  of  new  gadolinium  (Gd)-
enhancing lesions over 4 scans at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 (calculated as the sum of these 4 MRI 
scans) and  all  secondary MRI  endpoints  including mean  cumulative  number  of  new  Gd-enhancing 
lesions  over  the  placebo-controlled  phase  (p=0.002),  the  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2 
hyperintense  lesions(p<0.001),  and  the  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions  (p=0.014).  There 
was a clear difference in efficacy between the BG00012 240 mg TID dose group compared to the 
120  mg  QD  and  the  120  mg  TID  treatment  groups  as  both  of  these  lower  doses  did  not 
demonstrate  any  significant  effect  in  the  EE  population  when  compared  to  placebo  for  any  MRI 
endpoints.  For  the  primary  analysis,  the  total  number  of  new  Gd-enhancing  lesions  accumulated 
over 4 scans from Week 12 through Week 24 by was reduced by 69% (p<0.001) for the 240 mg 
TID group. 
No  statistically  significant  differences  were  found  for  any  of  the  BG00012  treatment  groups  in 
comparison  to  placebo  on  the  ARR,  the  proportion  of  relapse-free  patients  or  the  EDSS  score. 
Generally,  the  annual  relapse  rate  was  rather  low  in  all  treatment  groups  and  no  clear  dose 
relationship could be observed. During the placebo controlled phase, the adjusted ARRs in the ITT 
population were 0.65, 0.42, 0.78, and 0.44 in the placebo, the BG00012 120 mg QD, 120 mg TID, 
and  240  mg  TID  groups  respectively.  During  the  dose  blinded  extension  phase,  the  ARRs  for  all 
treatment  groups  were  0.29,  0.26,  0.46  and  0.17  in  the  placebo/  BG00012  240  mg  TID,  the 
BG00012 120 mg QD, 120 mg TID, and 240 mg TID groups, respectively and thus were lower than 
in  the  initial  phase.  Similar  positive  trend  was  noted  for  the  proportions  of  relapse-free  patients 
which were greater during the extension phase. The best effect was achieved for the BG00012 120 
mg  QD  with  78%  relapse  free  patients.  The  change  in  EDSS  score  was  rather  small  across  all 
groups at all visits. However this might be expected given the short duration of the study.  
There  were  considerable  imbalances  at  baseline  for  the  mean  number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions 
across the groups (notably in the 120 mg TID group which presented patients with higher disease 
activity i.e. higher number of Gd enhancing lesions). To further interpret the MRI results, subgroup 
analyses were added to the protocol after database lock by the applicant and additional sensitivity 
analyses  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  during  the  evaluation.  In  the  CHMP  requested  analyses 
using  the  number  of  baseline  Gd-enhancing  lesions  as  covariates,  BG00012  120  mg  TID  also 
provided  statistically  significant  results  for  the  primary  endpoint  (p=0.009).  The  mean  total 
number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  was  1.7  and  1.1  for  the  120  mg  TID  and  the  240  mg  TID 
treatment arm, respectively. Results were supported by analyses using other MRI endpoints (new 
or  newly-enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions,  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions  at  Week  24. 
Hence,  when  correcting  for  the  baseline number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  in  the  statistical  models 
as a covariate, the effect of the 120 mg TID dosing regimen also reached statistical significance for 
the various MRI endpoints, at least in one of the requested models. However, the CHMP noted that 
this  lower  dose  (120  mg  TID)  was  no  longer  tested  in  the  phase  III  studies.  Dosing  regimens  of 
240 mg BID and TID were subsequently used.

a  1:1:1  ratio.  Subjects  in  each  group  were  to  take  2  capsules  of  blinded  study  treatment  orally 
TID,  except  during  the  first  week,  when  they  were  to  take  1  capsule  orally  TID.  The  duration  of 
treatment  was  96  weeks.  Subjects  who  completed  the  treatment  period  and  did  not  enter  the 
extension  study  (109MS303)  were  to  have  their  end-of-study  visit  4  weeks  later  (Week  100). 
Rescue treatment options for subjects who relapsed or experienced confirmed disability progression 
(Lublin  and  Reingold,  2001;  Polman  et  al.,  2008)  could  be  given.  In  particular,  if  a  subject 
experienced  a  relapse  at  or  after  Week  24  that  was  confirmed  by  an  independent  committee  of 
neurologists  and  the  subject  had  received  study  treatment  for  at  least  48  weeks,  or  if  a  subject 
experienced  confirmed (12-week)  disability  progression  at  any  time  during  the  study,  the  subject 
was  offered  the  option  of  continuing  on  blinded  study  treatment,  switching  to  an  approved, 
alternative MS medication while continuing to be followed in the study, or declining treatment with 
an approved, alternative MS medication while continuing to be followed in the study. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  whether  BG00012,  when  compared  with  placebo,  was 
effective  in  reducing  the  proportion  of  relapsing  patients  at  2  years.  The  secondary  objectives 
were to determine whether BG00012, when compared with placebo, was effective based on further 
clinical  variables  and  MRI  variables  as  defined  in  the  secondary  outcome  measures.  Tertiary 
objectives included the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of BG00012 and of its effect, when 
compared  with  placebo  based  on  additional  parameters  as  defined  in  the  tertiary  outcome 
measures. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
In general, for efficacy endpoints, 1 year refers to the Week 48 assessments, and 2 year refers to 
the Week 96 assessments. 
Primary outcome measure 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 36/126 
 
  
  
  
 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee (INEC)-
confirmed patients who experienced a relapse over the course of 2 years. 
Secondary outcome measures 
The  secondary  endpoints,  which  were  assessed  at  2  years,  were:  1)  the  total  number  of  new  or 
newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans  ;  2)  the  number  of  Gd-enhancing 
lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans;  3)  the  annualized  rate  of  clinical  relapses  and  4)  progression  of 
disability that is sustained for 12 weeks as measured by either at least a 1.0 point increase on the 
EDSS  score  from  baseline  EDSS  score  ≥1.0,  or  at  least  a  1.5  point  increase  on  the  EDSS  score 
from baseline EDSS score = 0. 
Tertiary outcome measures 
These  included:  Multiple  Sclerosis  Functional  Composite  Scale  (MSFC)  scores  at  1  and  2  years; 
Visual  Analogue  Scale  (VAS)  score;  SF-36  Health  Survey  (SF-36)  score;  EuroQol-5D  (EQ-5D) 
score,  proportion  of  subjects  relapsed  at  1  year;  rate  of  clinical  relapses  at  1  year;  number  of 
relapses  requiring  intravenous  (IV)  steroid  therapy;  number  of  MS-related  hospitalizations  at  1 
year  and  2  years;  total  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans  at  1  and  2 
years;  volume  of  T1  hypointense  lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans  at  1  and  2  years;  volume  of  T2 
hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans at 1 and 2 years; volume of Gd-enhancing lesions on brain 
MRI  scans  at  1  and  2  years;  total  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  on 
brain  MRI  scans  in  at  1  year;  number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  at  1  year,  brain 
atrophy  over  2  years;  magnetization  transfer  ratio  (MTR)  in  the  whole  brain  at  1  and  2  years;  
change in PASAT 3, change in MSFC component from baseline to 1 and 2 years; time to onset of a 
0.5 standard deviation (SD) worsening in the PASAT 3 that is sustained for 12 weeks , change in 
visual function from baseline to 1 and 2 years. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 337 per treatment group will have 90% power to detect a 30% reduction in the 
proportion  of  subjects  relapsed  at  2  years  in  each  of  the  BG00012  groups  compared  with  the 
placebo  group,  based  on  the  Chi-square  test.  This  calculation  assumes  that  the  estimates  for 
proportion of subjects relapsed by 2 years are 48%  for the placebo group and 33.6% for each of 
the  BG00012  groups.  It  also  assumes  a  drop-out  rate  of  23%  over  the  2  years  and  a  5%  type  I 
error rate.  
Randomisation 
It  was  performed  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  and  stratified  by  site  using  a  centralised  interactive  voice 
response system (IVRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
Placebo and BG00012 capsules were identical in size, shape, colour, and taste. All study staff was 
blinded  to  the  subjects’  randomized  treatment  assignments  for  placebo  and  BG00012.  Also,  to 
prevent site personnel from observing any drug-induced symptoms (e.g., flushing), subjects were 
instructed  not  to  take their  dose of  study  treatment  within  4  hours  before  a  clinic  visit.      Efficacy 
measures  were  assessed  by  a  blinded  examining  neurologist,  with  routine  neurological  care  and 
safety  measures  assessed  by  a  separate  treating  neurologist.  The  roles  of  the  examining  and 
treating neurologists were not interchangeable. All relapses were confirmed by a INEC, and all MRI 
scans  were  read  in  a  blinded  manner  at  independent  central  laboratories  for  the  evaluation  of 
radiological endpoints.

Statistical methods 
ITT, PP populations and MRI cohort (defined as all subjects in the ITT population who consented to 
participate in  the  MRI  and  had  any  MRI  data  recorded)  were  used  for  efficacy  analysis.  .  The  ITT 
population was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy endpoints. 
For all primary and secondary endpoints the two BG00012 treatments were compared with placebo 
in order to test the hypothesis that the active treatment was statistically superior to placebo.  For 
each primary and secondary endpoint a number of sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in order 
to  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  results.  To  control  the  Type  I  error  set  at  5%,  a  hierarchical 
testing  scheme  was  pre-specified  in  which  for  each  endpoint,  beginning  with  the  primary  and 
followed by the secondary endpoints, in an pre-defined order, the two active BG00012 treatments 
were  tested  in  the  following  order:  BG00012  240  mg  TID  versus  placebo;  BG00012  240  mg  BID 
versus  placebo.  In  this  closed  testing  scheme  the  second  dosing  regimen  (BID)  was  only  tested 
statistically  if  the  first  dosing  regimen  (TID)  had  achieved  statistical  superiority  at  the  two-sided 
5%  level  of  significance.    Furthermore  each  secondary  endpoint  was  only  tested  if  all  previous 
endpoints  in  the  pre-defined  order  had  demonstrated  statistical  superiority  for  both  dosing 
regimen. This closed testing procedure was used in order to control for multiplicity. 
In the primary analyses of all efficacy endpoints except for that of confirmed disability progression 
based  on  EDSS  scores,  observed  data  after  alternative  MS  medications  were  initiated  were 
excluded,  or  subjects  were  censored  at  the  time  of  the  alternative  medication  initiation.  Missing 
post-baseline  MRI  data  were  imputed,  using  the  subject’s  observed  post-baseline  data,  on  the 
assumptions  that  new  lesions  develop  at  a  constant  rate.    Missing  data  were  not  imputed  for 
subjects with no post-baseline measurements. 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  also  analysed  for  the  following  pre-specified 
subgroups: baseline EDSS score (EDSS ≤2.0 versus EDSS >2.0); age (age <40 versus age ≥40); 
gender;    region;    baseline  weight  (by  quartiles);    baseline  number  of  relapses  (≤1  and  ≥2); 
baseline  McDonald  criteria  (1  versus  2,  3,  and  4);  prior  treatment  with  a  medication  for  MS  (Yes 
versus  No);  MRI  cohort  (Yes  versus  No);  baseline  Gd-enhancing  lesions  (absent  or  present),  MRI 
cohort only; baseline T2 hyperintense volume (above or below median), MRI cohort only. 
No interim analyses were conducted.   
The primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of subjects relapsed at 2 years, was analysed by the 
Cox  proportional  hazards  model  for  the  time  to  first  relapse  (prior  to  initiation  of  rescue 
medication),  adjusted  for  treatment,  region,  number  of  relapses  in  the  one  year  prior  to  study 
entry, baseline age (<40 versus ≥40 years), and EDSS score (≤2.0 versus >2.0).  The proportion 
of  subjects  who  experienced  a  relapse  over  the  2-year  period  was  estimated  as  the  cumulative 
probability of relapse from the Kaplan-Meier curve of the time to first relapse during the study (i.e., 
the  Kaplan-Meier  product-limit  estimator).    If  there  were  no  early  withdrawals  during  the  study, 
the  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  the  proportion  of  subjects  relapsed  at  2  years  is  the  same  as  the 
observed  proportion  of  subjects  relapsed  by  2  years.    Since  the  proportion  of  subjects  who 
experienced  a  relapse  was  estimated  from  the  Kaplan-Meier  curve,  the  treatment  groups  were 
compared using a Cox proportional hazards model for the time to the first relapse.  In addition to 
the  estimated  proportion  of  subjects  relapsed  at  2  years,  the  estimated  proportions  of  subjects 
relapsed at 24 weeks, 48 weeks (1 year), and 72 weeks were presented. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed  using  different  definitions  of  relapse  (e.g.,  objective  relapses)  or  different  populations 
(e.g.,  per-protocol  population),  or  included  data  after  subjects  switched  to  alternative  MS 
medication. Additional sensitivity analyses also used logistic regression. 
The four secondary endpoints were tested in the following pre-specified order: 1) total number of 
new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans  at  2  years  (MRI  cohort);  2) 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 38/126 
 
  
  
  
 
total  number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  scans  at  2  years  (MRI  cohort);  3)  annualized 
relapse rate at 2 years and 4) progression of disability at 2 years. 
The  annualized  relapse  rate  for  each  treatment  group  was  estimated  in  three  ways.    However  all 
statistical  inference  was  based  on  the  adjusted  rate  obtained  from  a  generalised  linear  model  in 
which  the  number  of  relapses  was  adjusted  for  covariates  that  were  considered  to  be  important 
predictors  of  response.    Therefore  the  annualized  relapse  rate  at  2  years  was  analyzed  using  a 
negative binomial regression model adjusted for baseline EDSS score (≤2.0 versus>2.0), baseline 
age (<40 versus ≥40 years), region, and the number of relapses in the year prior to study entry. 
Disability  progression  measured  by  EDSS  over  2  years  was  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional-
hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curves. Progression based on 12-week confirmation and 24-week 
confirmation was also analysed.  Subjects who did not have a sustained progression were censored 
for the analysis.   
Negative  binomial  regression  was  used  to  analyse  the  number  of  new  or  newly-enlarging  T2 
hyperintense lesions and the number of new T1 hypointense lesions over 2 years.  Ordinal logistic 
regression was used for the analysis of the number of Gd-enhancing lesions at 2 years.   
GCP issues were identified with three of the centres; the 23 patients from these sites were included 
in the ITT population and sensitivity analyses were also conducted excluding these patients.

Recruitment 
The first subject was treated on 14 March 2007, and the last subject received his or her last dose 
on 10 February 2011. The last subject completed the study on 23 February 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
The  five  protocol  amendments  prior  to  database  lock  were  related  to  the  study  design  and 
evaluation.  These  included  revision  of  the  objectives  (rank  order,  secondary/tertiary  endpoints 
were interchanged regarding the reduction of the annualized relapse rate at 1 year and at 2 years), 
increased safety monitoring  (review of the cardiovascular risk factor at entry), increasing sites and 
country specific amendments related to provision of interferon beta-1a (Avonex).

Figure  4.  Time  to  Confirmed  Progression  of  Disability  as  Measured  by  Increase  in  EDSS 
score (12 Weeks Confirmation) - ITT Population 
Tertiary outcome measures 
Proportion  of  subjects  relapsed  over  the  first  year  was  31%  in  the  placebo  group,  compared  to 
16.7%  in  the  BG00012  BID  group  and  17.8%  in  the  TID  group.  The  hazard  ratios  were  0.49  for 
BG00012 BID versus placebo and 0.54 for BG00012 TID versus placebo (both p <0.0001). 
The  adjusted  annualized  rate  of  INEC-confirmed  relapses  over  1  year  was  0.367  in  the  placebo 
group, compared with 0.183 in the BG00012 BID group and 0.207 in the BG00012 TID group. The 
hazard  ratios  were  0.50  for  BG00012  BID  versus  placebo  (p<0.0001)  and  0.56  for  BG00012  TID 
versus placebo (p =0.0002). 
A total of 211 INEC-confirmed relapses required IV steroid therapy in the placebo group, compared 
to 111 and 114 in the BG00012 BID and TID groups, respectively.  The adjusted annualized rate of 
relapses requiring IV steroids at 2 years was 0.310 in the placebo group, compared to 0.149 and 
0.150 in the BG00012 BID and TID groups, respectively. The hazard ratios were 0.48 for BG00012 
BID versus placebo (p<0.0001) and 0.49 for BG00012 TID versus placebo (both p <0.0001). 
The  adjusted  annualized  rate  of  MS-related  hospitalization  (ie  relapses  or  other  MS-related 
complications) at 2 years was 0.056 in the placebo group, compared with 0.036 and 0.030 in the 
BG00012 BID and TID groups, respectively. The rate ratios obtained from the model were 0.653 (p 
=  0.0708)  for  BG00012  BID  versus  placebo  and  0.546  (p  =  0.0125)  for  BG00012  TID  versus 
placebo,  representing  reductions  over  placebo  of  35%  and  45%,  respectively.    BG00012  BID  and 
TID  reduced  the  annualized  rate  of  MS-related  hospitalizations  over  1  year  by  32%  (p  =  0.1633) 
and 48% (p = 0.0278), respectively. 
At 2 years, improvement on MSFC composite z-score and individual components (PASAT 3, 9HPT, 
T25FW) and visual functions were observed for both BG00012 BID and TID groups however all the 
results were not statistically significant.  
Proportion  of  subjects  with  confirmed  progression  of  cognitive  deficit  at  2  years  was  9.9%  in  the 
placebo group compared with 9.8% and 10.7% in the BG00012 BID and TID groups, respectively.

The  hazard  ratios  obtained  from  the  model  were  1.04  (p  =  0.8739)  for  BG00012  BID  versus 
placebo and 1.10 (p = 0.6801) for BG00012 TID versus placebo.  
Consistency with the clinical findings was also observed on the MRI tertiary endpoints, although all 
of these results were not statistically significant. Positive findings were also observed in the patient 
health reported outcomes. 
2.5.2.3.  Study 109MS302 
This  was  a  96  week,  multicenter    double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group 
study    evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  BG00012  240  mg  BID  and  240  mg  TID  administered 
orally versus placebo and glatiramer acetate in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(see Figure 5). 
Figure 5 
The  study  was  conducted  in  a  number  of  European  countries  and  also  in  non-EU  regions  (e.g 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ukraine, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Mexico and the United States). 
2.5.2.3.1.  Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as for those for study 109MS301 except that 
subjects previously treated with GA were excluded. 
Treatment 
Randomised  patients  were  assigned  in  a  ratio  of  1:1:1:1  to  receive:  1)  Group  1:  DMF  240  mg 
orally twice daily (2 capsules [120 mg each] BID and 2 placebo capsules QD); 2) Group 2: DMF240 
mg TID (2 capsules [120 mg each] TID); 3) Group 3: Placebo (2 capsules TID) and 4) Group 4: GA 
(20 mg subcutaneous [SC] injection, QD).  Hence,  subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were to take 2 
capsules  of  blinded  study  treatment  orally  TID,  except  during  the  first  week,  when  they  were  to 
take 1 capsule orally TID at 240 mg dose.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine whether BG00012 was effective in reducing the rate of 
clinical  relapses  at  2  years.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to  determine  whether  BG00012, 
when compared with placebo, was effective based on further clinical variables and on MRI variables 
as defined in the secondary outcome measures. Tertiary objectives included the evaluation of the 
safety  and  tolerability  of  BG00012  and  of  its  relative  benefit  risk  versus  placebo  with  GA  versus 
placebo using mainly the same outcome measures as for study 109MS301.   
Outcome measures 
Primary outcome measures 
The primary endpoint is the annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 2 years, which is evaluated as the 
number of relapses over the course of 2 years. 
Secondary outcome measures 
The secondary endpoints which were assessed at 2 years were:1) the total number of new or newly 
enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans, 2) the total number of new T1 hypointense 
lesions on brain MRI scans, 3) the proportion of subjects relapsed, 4) the progression of disability 
that  is  sustained  for  12  weeks  as  measured  by  either  at  least  a  1.0  point  increase  on  the  EDSS 
score  from  baseline  EDSS  score    ≥1.0,  or  at  least  a  1.5  point  increase  on  the  EDSS  score  from 
baseline EDSS score = 0. 
Sample size 
It  was  anticipated  that  the  annualized  relapse  rate  in  the  placebo  group  would  be  approximately 
0.61,  while  the  rate  on  the  BG00012  group  would  be  approximately  0.456.  A  sample  size  of  308 
subjects  per  group  (BG00012  or  placebo)  would  provide  approximately  84%  power  to  detect  a 
25% reduction in the annualized relapse rate at 2 years in the BG00012 group compared with the 
placebo  group  (difference  between  0.61  and  0.456).  A  drop-out  rate  of  23%  over  2  years  was 
assumed.  Due  to  the  1:1:1:1  randomization  ratio,  the  GA  group  also  had  308  subjects.  The  total 
planned sample size for the study was 1232. 
Randomisation 
It was performed in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and stratified by site using a centralised IVRS. 
Blinding 
Blinding  methodology  was  the  same  as  for  study  109MS301  except  that  only  the  examining 
neurologist was blinded to treatment for all subjects, including for subjects who received GA. 
Statistical methods 
These  were  mainly  the  same  as  for  study  109MS301  except  that  a  separate  but  similar  closed 
testing  scheme  was  specified  for  comparing  the  single  dose  of  glatiramer  with  placebo.    However 
for BG00012 versus glatiramer, no formal hypothesis testing was intending for this comparison and 
the results were presented as estimates with associated 95% confidence intervals but no p-values 
were provided.

Recruitment 
The  first  subject  was  treated  on  28  July  2007,  and  the  last  subject  received  the  last  dose  on  04 
August 2011. The last subject completed the study on 24 August 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
The  three  protocol  amendments  were  related  to  the  study  design  and  evaluation.  These  included 
mainly  increased  safety  monitoring  (review  of  the  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  blood  and  urinary 
analysis  to  monitor  renal  function)  and  changes  of  eligibility  for  patients  receiving  approved  open 
label MS therapy. 
Of  note,  additional  changes  to  the  analysis  described  in  the  final  SAP  were  as  follows:  the 
treatment  effect  of  BG00012  versus  GA  for  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  was 
measured in terms of point estimates and 95% CIs to describe the variability about the estimated 
effects, however this comparison was not pre-specified; the analysis of MTR was planned in whole 
brain  and  in  normal  appearing  brain  tissue  (NABT);  however,  the  results  for  NABT  were  not 
reported by the MRI facility and therefore, these data were not included in the study database.

Number analysed 
In  total,  99-100  %  of  randomised  patients  were  included  in  the  ITT  and  safety  population.  One 
subject randomized to BG00012 240 mg TID actually received GA. For this reason, the distribution 
of  subjects  is  different  in  the  ITT  (analyzed  as  randomized)  and  safety  (analysed  as  treated) 
populations.  Thirteen  subjects  (3  randomized  to  BG00012  BID  and  10  randomized  to  GA)  were 
randomized but not dosed and were, by definition, excluded from the ITT and safety populations.

Tertiary outcome measures 
The  adjusted  annualized  rates  of  INEC-confirmed  relapses  at  1  year  (0.462 in  the  placebo  group, 
compared  with  0.262  in  the  BG00012  BID  group  and  0.250  in  the  BG00012  TID  group), 
represented reductions of 43.3% (p=0.0002) and 46% (p <0.0001) over placebo following 1 year 
of  treatment  with  BG00012  BID  and  BG00012  TID,  respectively.  In  the  GA  group,  the  annualized 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 59/126 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
relapse rate at 1 year (0.339) represented a significant reduction of 26.6% (p = 0.0298) compared 
to placebo. 
Proportion of subjects relapsed over the first year was 31.8% in the placebo group, compared with 
20.6% in the BG00012 BID group and 19.1% in the TID group. These data represent reductions in 
the  risk  of  relapse  at  1  year  of  36.8%  (p=0.0030)  and  42.5%  (p=0.0006),  respectively,  in  the 
BG00012  BID  and  TID  groups  compared  to  placebo.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  an  INEC-
confirmed  relapse  in  the  GA  group  (23.9%)  was  also  lower  than  that  of  the  placebo  group  and 
represented a significant (p=0.0217) reduction of 28.7% over placebo. 
A total of 191 required IV steroid therapy in the placebo group, compared with 110 relapses in the 
BG00012  BID  group  and  95  in  the  BG0002  TID  group.    The  adjusted  annualized  rate  of  relapses 
requiring IV steroids at 2 years was 0.344 in the placebo group, compared with 0.194 and 0.176 in 
the BG00012 BID and TID groups respectively and 0.256 in the GA group. The rate ratios versus 
placebo were 0.56 for BG00012 BID (p=0.0002), 0.51 for   BG00012 TID (p<0.0001) and 0.74 for 
GA (p=0.0404). 
The  adjusted  annualized  rate  of  MS-related  hospitalization  (ie  relapses  or  other  MS-related 
complications) at 2 years was 0.055 in the placebo group, compared with 0.038 and 0.028 in the 
BG00012 BID and TID groups and 0.032 in GA groups respectively.  These results corresponded to 
reductions of 32% (p=0.1092),50% (p=0.0098) and 43% (p=0.0282) respectively, over placebo. 
At 2 years, improvement on MSFC composite z-score and individual components (PASAT 3, 9HPT, 
T25FW) and visual functions were observed for both BG00012 BID and TID groups however all the 
results  were  not  statistically  significant.  Similar  conclusions  were  made  for  the  VAS,  SF-36  -PCS 
component, EQ- 5D scores. 
Consistency with the clinical findings was also observed on the MRI tertiary endpoints, although all 
of these results were not statistically significant. Positive findings were also observed in the patient 
health reported outcomes. In the GA group, similar findings were noted on the MRI and quality of 
life outcomes used in the efficacy analysis. 
2.5.2.4.  Ancillary analyses 
The  applicant  presented  a  number  of  subgroup  analyses,  based  on  the  following  main  criteria:  
gender, age, EDSS baseline score, volume of T2 lesions, number of Gd enhancing lesions, previous 
MS treatment; reason to discontinue prior approved MS treatments (lack of efficacy, other reasons 
or no prior approved treatment), number of relapses in the year prior to study entry (≤1 and ≥2), 
duration  of  illness.  However,  the  subgroups  as  defined  by  the  applicant  provided  limited 
information  in  relation  to  patients  with  high  disease  activity  based  on  combination  of  clinical  and 
MRI findings.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  specifically  requested  the  applicant  to  provide  data  on  patients  with  high 
disease activity including the following subgroups: 1) patients having had at least 1 relapse in the 
previous year while on therapy, and having at least 9 T2- hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at 
least  1  Gd-enhancing  lesion  or  2)  patients  having  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or 
ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year. 
Main results are presented below.

The  risk  of  relapse  at  2  years  was  reduced  by  42.5%  (p  <0.0001)  and  47.4%  (p  <0.0001) 
following treatment with BG00012 BID and TID, respectively, compared with placebo. Both 240 mg 
BID and TID reduced the ARR by 48.5% compared to placebo over 2 years of treatment.  
Effect on disability progression 
For  BG00012  BID  and  TID  groups  respectively,  32%  and  30%  reductions  in  the  risk  of  12-week 
confirmed progression were observed (p=0.0034 and p<0.0059) and 29% and 32% reductions in 
the risk of 24-week confirmed progression were also noted (p=0.0278 and p=0.0177). 
Maintenance of the effect 
Consistent  statistically  significant  effects  with  both  doses  of  BG00012  of  similar  direction  and 
magnitude  were  seen  across  the  studies  at  each  6-month  period.    The  percentage  reduction  and 
95% CI in the annualized relapse rate by 6-month interval for BG00012 BID compared to placebo 
are presented in Table 24.

Withdrawal/Rebound effect 
For subjects who completed Studies 109MS301 and 109MS302 and chose not to enroll into Study 
109MS303,  there  was  a  1  month  follow-up  period  post-dose.  This  analysis  included  data  for 
subjects who prematurely discontinued study treatment and were followed for at least 1 day, and 
subjects who completed the 2-year study treatment period, and with at least 1 day off treatment 
(safety follow-up after the last dose, or gap between parent and extension study).   
Of the 1044 subjects included in this analysis, 58%, 54%, and 55% of subjects had up to 1 month 
of  follow-up  data,  and  42%,  46%,  and  45%  had  greater  than  1  month  follow-up  data  in  the 
placebo, BG00012 BID, and BG00012 TID groups, respectively.  The total number of subject-years 
of  follow-up  in this  analysis  was  approximately  52, 67,  and  60 in  the placebo, BG00012 BID, and 
BG00012 TID groups, respectively. Based on the analysis, the adjusted annualized relapse rate for 
subjects following the last dose was 0.178 (95% CI: 0.094, 0.338) in the placebo group, compared 
with 0.119 (95% CI: 0.061, 0.233) in the BG00012 BID group and 0.210 (95% CI: 0.118, 0.373) 
in the BG00012 TID group.

2.5.2.7.  Supportive study 
Study 109MS303 is an ongoing, 5 year, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, dose-blind, rater-
blind, dose-comparison extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of 2 
dose regimens of BG00012 in subjects with RRMS. Subjects who were randomized to BG00012 in 
studies 109MS301 or 109MS302 continue on the same BG00012 dose to which they were originally 
randomized.  Subjects  who  were  randomized  to  placebo  or  to  GA  (Study  109MS302)  were  re-
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BG00012 240 mg BID or 240 mg TID.  
The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety profile of BG00012.  Efficacy endpoints 
included  annualized  relapse  rate,  proportion  of  subjects  relapsed,  disability  progression  as 
measured by the EDSS, and MRI measures of disease activity in subjects at selected investigational 
sites based on the availability of the necessary MRI equipment (MRI cohort).  
Available data as of 03 August 2011 were submitted as part of the present application. A total of 
1738 subjects had entered the study and 1734 subjects who had received a dose of BG00012 240 
mg BID or TID as of this date, were analysed. 
Main results are presented in Figures 19 and 20.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme consisted of one phase II placebo controlled study (Study C-
1900)  and  two phase  III  studies,  one  placebo  controlled  (Study  109MS301)  and  one  placebo  and 
active  controlled  (Study  109MS302).  However  the  latter  study  including  the  active  comparator 
(glatiramer  acetate:  GA)  was  not  designed  for  a  comparison  of  treatment  effects  in  BG00012  in 
relation to GA. In addition interim data from an ongoing extension study of the 2 phase III studies 
(Study 109MS303) were provided.  
In the dose-ranging study, patients received BG00012 120 mg per day, 360 mg per day or 720 mg 
per  day  for  24  weeks.  In  study  109MS301  and  study  109MS302,  two  different  doses  of  BG00012 
were used: 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID. 
The duration of the completed studies, 6 month double blind treatment phase in the dose ranging 
study and 2 years in the pivotal studies, were considered adequate by the CHMP. 
All  studies  were  multicentre  and  multinational  and  included  only  patients  with  relapsing-remitting 
MS.  Diagnosis  of  MS  was  based  on  the  McDonald  criteria.  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were 
similar across these 4 studies, patients with a history of treatment with glatiramer were excluded 
in  study  109MS302.  Patients  over  55  years  were  also  excluded  from  the  clinical  studies.  Of  note, 
baseline EDSS score above 5.5 was defined as an exclusion criterion and the clinical characteristic 
for disease activity was the number of relapses in the last year, “at least one relapse within the 12 
months prior to randomization”, that was used as inclusion criterion.  
Relevant efficacy endpoints were selected in accordance with the guideline on Clinical Investigation 
of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis or MS GL (CPMP/EWP/561/98 Rev. 1).  
An Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee (INEC) was established to re-assess relapses that 
were  already  defined  by  the  examining  neurologist.  The  conclusion  of  the  INEC  was  used  for  the 
definition  of  the  confirmed  relapses.  From  the  CHMP  viewpoint,  this  was  not  considered  as  a 
conventional  procedure.  However,  a  sensitivity  analysis  based  on  objective  relapses  (those 
determined  by  the  site  and  not  by  INEC)  was  also  performed  and  seen  as  highly  relevant  as  it 
assigned a status of relapse that is commonly used in recent MS trials. 
Time  to  disability  progression  was  measured  by  at  least  a  1.0  point  increase  on  the  EDSS  from 
baseline EDSS score ≥ 1.0 that was confirmed 12 weeks later, or at least a 1.5 point increase on 
the EDSS from baseline EDSS score equal to 0 that was confirmed 12 weeks later. Hence the six-
month  sustained  disability  progression  endpoint,  as 
recommended 
in 
the  MS  GL 
(CPMP/EWP/561/98 Rev. 1) was chosen only for the sensitivity analysis on this endpoint. 
Data  from  studies  109MS301  and  109MS302  were also  pooled  for  analysing  a  number  of  efficacy 
outcome measures including ARR at 2 years, risks of 12-week and 24 week confirmed progression. 
According  to  the  applicant,  this  integrated  analysis  was  pre-specified.  However,  the  CHMP  was  of 
the  opinion  that  the  pooled  analysis  could  not  be  regarded  as  pre-specified,  given  its  date  of 
inclusion in the final SAP.  Results of study MS301 were also already available before the SAP for 
the pooled analysis was performed.  In addition, the CHMP considered that there were a number of 
differences  between  the  two  pivotal  studies  that  questioned  the  value  of  pooling  of  the  data, 
especially with regard to the endpoints, time to 3-and 6- months sustained disability progression. 
These included the following: 1) approximately 40 % of the patients were recruited in Region 3 for 
study 109MS301 when it was 65% for study 109MS302, 2) EDSS scores were on average higher in 
study  109MS302,  3)  40%  of  patients  had  prior  MS  treatment in  study  109MS301  against  29%  in 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 78/126 
 
  
  
  
 
study  109MS302,  4)  The  number  of  volume  of  Gd-enhancing  and  T2  lesions  was  higher  in  study 
109MS302 and 5) The criterion for discontinuation of study medication after 48 weeks was different 
in the two studies. Differences in the 2 pivotal studies regarding the effect for 12-week confirmed 
disability  progression  were  also  observed  in  all  groups  including  the  placebo  (see  below).  It 
appeared  that  no  consistency  between  the  two  studies  could  be  seen  for  those  patients  with 
baseline EDSS score greater than 3.5 for either the 12-week or the 24-week endpoints (see Figures 
14-17).  Rules  for  switching  medication  were  not  the  same  as  well,  this  being  recognised  by  the 
applicant itself to potentially impact on disability progression at 24 week endpoint. 
Across  studies  109MS301 and  109MS302,  patients  were  aged  between  18  and  55  (median  38-39 
years)  and  were  mainly  Caucasian.  Approximately  70%  were  female.  The  mean  baseline  EDSS 
score was 2.5. Only a small number of patients had a score of 3.5 or above. 40% of patients had 
prior  MS  treatment  in  study  109MS301,  only  29%  in  study  109MS302.  In  both  pivotal  studies, 
there  was  a  clear  low  relapse  rate  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  of  the  patients  in  all  treatment 
groups  experienced  0  relapses  (109MS301:  58%  placebo,  76%  BG00012  240  mg  BID,  77% 
BG00012 240 mg TID; 109MS302: 61% placebo, 74% BG00012  240 mg BID, 78% BG00012 240 
mg TID, 70% GA).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Dosing rationale 
In  the  dose  ranging  study  (C-1900)  using  either  120  mg  QD  BG00012  (120  mg),  120  mg  TID 
BG00012  (360  mg),  240 mg  TID  BG00012  (720  mg),  the  highest  dose,  240  mg  TID  of  BG00012 
showed  statistically  significant  differences  in  comparison  to  placebo  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the 
total  number of  new  Gd-enhancing  lesions  over 4  scans  at different  weeks  and  all  secondary  MRI 
endpoints. There was a clear difference in efficacy between the BG00012 240 mg TID dose group 
compared to the 120 mg QD and the 120 mg TID treatment groups as both of these lower doses 
did not demonstrate any significant effect in the EE population when compared to placebo for any 
MRI  endpoints.  However,  considerable  imbalances  at  baseline  for  the  mean  number  of  Gd-
enhancing  lesions  across  the  groups,  notably  in  the  120  mg  TID  group  which  presented  patients 
with higher disease activity ie higher number of Gd-enhancing lesions were observed and additional 
sensitivity analyses were requested to further interpret the MRI results. In these analyses using the 
number  of  baseline  Gd-enhancing  lesions  as  covariates,  BG00012  120  mg  TID  also  provided 
statistically significant results for the primary endpoint (p=0.009). The mean  total number of Gd-
enhancing  lesions  was  1.7  and  1.1  for  the  120  mg  TID  and  the  240  mg  TID  treatment  arm, 
respectively.  Results  were  supported  by  analyses  on  various  MRI  endpoints.  However,  the  CHMP 
noted  that  this  lower  dose  (120  mg  TID)  was  no  longer  tested  in  the  phase  III  studies.  Dosing 
regimens of 240 mg BID and TID were subsequently used and were considered acceptable by the 
CHMP in view of the overall results. 
In phase III studies, there was a small difference between the two doses altogether for the efficacy 
on  relapses  (although  the  differences  were  higher  in  study  109MS302),  the  selection  of  240  mg 
BID as the recommended dose was therefore considered acceptable by the CHMP.  In addition, all 
of these studies were based on a 1 week escalation regimen and dose reductions were allowed to 
minimise  the  flushing  and  GI  events.  The  CHMP  hence  accepted  to  use  such  flexibility  in  dosing 
regimen for the final posology as the tolerability profile was also found adequate.   
Effect on relapses 
In study 109MS301, BG00012 BID and TID reduced the risk of relapse at 2 years over placebo by 
49% (p <0.0001) and 50% (p <0.0001), respectively. The annualized relapse rate versus placebo 
was  also  reduced  by  53%  (p  <0.0001)  and  48%  (p  <0.0001),  respectively.  In  the  sensitivity 
analyses,  results  were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  showing  statistically  significant 
differences for both active treatment groups in comparison to placebo. Based on the analysis using 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 79/126 
 
  
  
  
“objective relapses”, consistent results were observed for the lower BG00012 dose (BG00012 240 
mg BID : HR=0.5; BG00012 240 mg TID: HR=0.54).  
In study 109MS302, BG00012 BID and TID reduced the risk of relapse at 2 years over placebo by 
34%  (p=0.0020)  and  45%  (p  <0.0001),  respectively;  the  annualized  relapse  rate  versus  placebo 
was reduced by 44% (p <0.0001) and 50.5% (p<0.0001), respectively. When using analysis based 
on “objective relapses”, the reduction over placebo in the annualized rate of objective relapse at 2 
years  was  similar  to  that  for  INEC-confirmed  relapses  and  was  40.8%  and  51.5%,  for  BG00012 
BID and BG00012 TID, respectively (p <0.0001 for both tested doses). In the GA group, the ARR 
was  also  significantly  lower  than  the  placebo  group,  with  a  reduction  of  28.6%  compared  to 
placebo (p=0.0128) at 2 years.  
For both pivotal studies, a lesser effect of BG00012 on relapses in patients with higher EDSS score  
at baseline,  in non-naïve patients consistently in patients aged 40 years and above (see Figures 9-
13) was seen. 
Effect on disability progression 
In  study  109MS301,  both  DMF  tested  doses  reached  statistical  significance  when  compared  to 
placebo  in  reducing  the  risk  of  12-week  sustained disability progression  (240 mg  BID:  p=0.0050, 
240 mg TID: p=0.0128). The hazard ratios were 0.62 and 0.66 for 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID 
groups,  respectively.  In  study  109MS302,  both  DMF  tested  doses  failed  to  reach  statistical 
significance  when  compared  to  placebo  in  reducing  the  risk  of  12-week  sustained  disability 
progression  (240  mg  BID:  p=0.2536;  240  mg  TID:  p=0.2041).  The  hazard  ratios  were  0.79  and 
0.76 for 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID groups, respectively. In both individual studies, a sensitivity 
analysis was performed in terms of 24-week sustained disability progression. Although, none of the 
BG00012  treatment  arms  reached  statistical  significance  when  compared  to  placebo,  a  similar 
trend as for 12 weeks confirmed disability progression was however noted. In study 109MS301, the 
hazard ratios were 0.77 and 0.69 for 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID groups, respectively. In study 
109MS302,  the  hazard  ratios  were  0.62    and  0.67  for  240  mg  BID  and  240  mg  TID  groups, 
respectively. 
The  effect  on  disability  progression  was  not  considered  robust  enough  to  support  a  claim  for  a 
disease-modifying  drug  taking  into  account  that  the  pooled  analysis  could  not  be  accepted  for 
methodological  reasons  and  that  the  other  additional  analyses  provided  by  the  applicant  were  of 
post-hoc nature.  
Comparison versus Glatiramer and indirect comparison with other treatments 
Comparative data were provided of treatment effects in BG00012 in relation to GA. In the majority 
of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints,  including  the  ARR  and  time  to  3  month  sustained 
disability, an effect in favour of BG00012 was observed (see Figure 18). The CHMP concluded that 
no  confirmatory  conclusions  could  be  drawn  from  these  data  since  this  analysis  was  a  post-hoc 
direct comparison.  
Based on historical comparisons, there was a relative reduction for ARR of 44-53% under BG00012 
compared to a relative reduction in ARR of around 30% for interferons and GA, suggesting at least 
comparable  efficacy  on  relapses  for  BG00012  when  compared  to  approved  first-line  treatment. 
However, second-line treatments provided even better results on this endpoint. When considering 
time to disability progression, results for BG00012 are less convincing. No confirmatory conclusions 
could  be  made  regarding  relative  efficacy  versus  approved  MS  products,  however  the  CHMP 
considered these data supportive of the efficacy in the broad RRMS population. 
Long-term efficacy and withdrawal after discontinuation 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 80/126 
 
  
  
  
In  study  109MS303,  efficacy  was  maintained  after  one  year  in  patients  previously  treated  by 
BG00012 (Figures 19-20). A positive effect was seen in patients previously receiving placebo. The 
study  is  currently  ongoing  and  the  CHMP  therefore recommended  to  further  investigate this issue 
once more data become available. 
Efficacy  data  in  patients  who  discontinued  study  drug  were  considered  limited  to  evaluate  a 
possible rebound effect. 
Patients with high disease activity 
With  respect  to  the  definition  of  the  high  disease  activity  “patients  having  at  least  one  relapse  in 
the  past  year  while  on  therapy  with  beta-interferon,  and  at  least  9  T2-  hyperintense  lesions  in 
cranial  MRI  or  at  least  1  Gd-enhancing  lesion  or  having  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate” 
(20 % BG00012 BID population, n=177 in DEFINE and n=141 in CONFIRM); and “patients with at 
least 2  relapses in  past  year  and  1  Gd  lesion  at  baseline”  (6%  BG00012  BID  population,  n=42  in 
DEFINE and n=51 in CONFIRM) used by the applicant, the CHMP considered that it was analogous 
to the currently authorised indications for Tysabri and Gilenya. Although a general consensus over 
the  definition  of  high  disease  activity  is  currently  lacking,  these  subgroups  were  considered 
relevant.  Reference  to  treatment  effects  in  these  subgroups  was  considered  essential  to  the 
prescribing physician and was thus included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Extrapolation of the efficacy to Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) 
The CHMP requested the applicant to further investigate whether an extrapolation of the study data 
could  be  envisaged  to  the  RMS  population,  taking  into  account  mechanistic  considerations  and 
available  literature.  Only  patients  with  RRMS  were  included  in  the  main  clinical  trials,  however, 
subgroups of patients defined as “representative of SMPS patients” by the applicant were analysed.  
The  CHMP  however  did  not  consider  these  subgroup  analyses  adequate,  especially  taking  into 
account that the sensitivity of the EDSS measurement is known to be reduced in the higher range.  
Literature  data  suggested  that  there  is  a  pathophysiological  difference  described  for  RRMS  and 
SPMS with superimposed relapses as the process in SPMS relates more to a cellular/axon loss than 
to simple inflammation.  Given the DMF mechanism on MS is not completely understood and in the 
absence  of  trial  data  in  SPMS  patients,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  a  clear  extrapolation  of  efficacy 
observed in RRMS patients to SPMS patients with superimposed relapses cannot be made. 
Additional expert consultation 
At the SAG Neurology meeting held on 13 February 2013, the applicant proposed indication under 
discussion was as follows: 
“TECFIDERA  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis (see section 5.1).” 
The main SAG conclusions for DMF were as follows: 
- 
The efficacy over placebo on disease activity (relapse and MRI parameters) was demonstrated. 
However, efficacy over progression of disability was not considered as clearly established, in 
particular as the effect lacked consistency across the two studies and as both studies failed on the 
time to 6 month sustained disability secondary endpoint.  
-  Although only historical comparison can be made across products in the absence of head to head 
comparative data, the panel felt that the efficacy of DMF is comparable to that of interferon beta.

- 
The risks, some of them serious (e.g. decrease of lymphocyte counts, elevation of hepatic 
enzymes) are manageable with adequate risk minimisation measures. As efficacy data are lacking 
for patients with high disease activity, the panel considered that DMF could be a valuable 
alternative to interferon beta for the treatment of patients with mildly active RRMS. 
Having  considered  the  SAG  conclusions  and  that  the  efficacy  of  DMF  over  the  broad  RRMS 
population  was  evident  in  several  subgroups  of  patients  (including  those  defined  as  high  disease 
activity),  the  CHMP  recommended  an  unrestricted  RRMS  indication.  A  cross  reference  was  also 
recommended to “important information on the population for which efficacy has been established” 
that has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that efficacy was demonstrated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis in the proposed dosing regimen for Tecfidera (DMF). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database presented in this dossier included the following datasets: 1) placebo-controlled 
MS studies (C-1900, Part 1; 109MS301; 109MS302) referred to as Pool A and 2) placebo-controlled 
and uncontrolled MS clinical studies (C-1900, 109MS301, 109MS302, 109MS303) or referred to as 
Pool B. 
In addition to these studies, data on the psoriasis safety experience with DMF together with three 
other fumaric salts that are currently marketed in this indication in Germany were provided using 
the following datasets: 1) short term placebo-controlled studies with BG00012 in psoriasis (Study 
12/01  Part  1,  12-Week  and  Study  01/02,  16-Week)  or    referred  to  as  Pool  C  and  2)  controlled 
psoriasis  studies  and  their  uncontrolled  extensions  (Study  12/01  Part  2  ,  6  months  and  Study 
03/03 , 2 years) referred to as Pool D. 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
A total of 2560 patients suffering from MS have been exposed to BG00012 during the clinical study 
program  (of  which  92  subjects  are  not  integrated  in  the  safety  database),  receiving  at  least  one 
dose  of  the  study  drug,  and  were  evaluable  for  safety.  Overall,  this  number  of  subjects  accounts 
for  around  3600  person-years  of  exposure.  1469  (1095)  of  2560  subjects  have  been  exposed  for 
≥1 year (≥2 years) at or above the dose, which the applicant applied for.  
2.6.2.  Adverse events 
The AE profile for Pool A representing all placebo-controlled studies, is considered representative of 
the DMF safety profile in MS patients and included 3 dosing regimens (lower BG00012 doses 
including 120 mg QD and 120 mg TID, 240 mg BID, 240 mg TID) and placebo groups (see Table 
25).

Table 25. Incidence of AEs at least 2% higher for any BG00012 group or GA relative to 
placebo (Pool A) 
Table 25 shows a clear excess of BG00012 over placebo for flushing and GI disorders related AEs. 
Flushing related events 
Flushing  (including  hot  flush)  and  related  symptoms,    erythema,  generalized  erythema,  burning 
sensation,  skin  burning,  feeling  hot,  and  hyperaemia  occurred  at  a  substantially  increased 
incidence  with  BG00012  compared  with  placebo  (Study  109MS301:  8%  placebo,  50% 
BG00012 BID,  46%  BG00012  TID;  Study  109MS302:  9%  placebo,  39%  BG00012  BID,  34% 
BG00012  TID,  5%  GA).  In  the  majority  of  patients,  flushing  and  related  symptoms  were  non-
serious in nature and were assessed as mild or moderate in severity. Severe flushing was reported 
in  1%  of  patients  in  both the BG00012  240mg  BID  and  TID  groups.  More  BG00012 than  placebo 
treated  patients  discontinued  due  to  flushing  although  the  incidence  was  not  high  (Study 
109MS301:  <1%  placebo,  2%  BG00012  BID,  1%  BG00012  TID;  Study  109MS302:  0%  placebo, 
4% BG00012 BID, 2% BG00012TID, 0% GA). 
In Pool A, the incidence of flushing and related event was highest during the first 3 months of the 
studies  (6%  placebo,  36%  BG00012  BID  and  35%  BG00012  TID),  then  decreased  substantially 
during the second 3 months (<1% placebo and 7% for both DMF groups), and continued to drop 
during the subsequent intervals through Month 24 (placebo: <1% to1%, BG00012BID: 2% to 6% 
and BG00012 TID: 2% to 4%).

Gastrointestinal related adverse events 
GI  related  events  were  reported  at  an  increased  incidence  with  BG00012  compared  with  placebo 
(Study 109MS301: 36% placebo, 44% BG00012 BID, 45% BG00012 TID; Study 109MS302: 26% 
placebo, 36% BG00012 BID, 41% BG00012 TID, 15% GA). In the majority of patients, GI related 
events  were  non-serious  in  nature,  and  assessed  as  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Among 
BG00012-treated  patients  there  was  an  increased  incidence  of  events  in  the  GI  SOC  that  led  to 
treatment  discontinuation  compared  with  placebo  (Study  109MS301:  1%  placebo,  5%  BG00012 
BID,  6%  BG00012  TID;  Study  109MS302:  <1%  placebo,  3%  BG00012  BID,  5%  BG00012  TID, 
<1%  GA),  although  the  incidence  of  individual  GI  AEs  including  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting, 
abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain was not high (≤2% each event).  
In  Pool  A,  the  incidence  of  events  associated  with  GI  tolerability  (e.g.,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  upper 
abdominal pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, GI disorder) in the BG00012 
groups  was  highest  during  the  first  3  months  (18%  versus  27%  and  30%),  then  decreased 
substantially  during  the  second  3-month  interval  (6%  versus  7%  and  8%)  and  occurred  at  a 
similar incidence during the subsequent 3-month intervals (4% to 6% versus 3% to 7% and 4% to 
7%) through month 24.  
Skin related events 
In  Pool  A,  the  overall  incidence  of  events  in  the  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  SOC  was 
higher in the BG00012 groups compared with the placebo group (20% placebo vs. 32% BG00012 
BID, 32% BG00012 TID, 17% GA). Pruritus (4% placebo vs. 8% BG00012 BID, 8% BG00012 TID, 
2% GA), rash (3% vs. 8%, 7%, and 3%), erythema (1% vs. 5%, 7%, and 2%), and hyperhidrosis 
(1%  vs.  2%,  3%,  1%)  were  among  the  events  with  an  incidence  of  2%  or  more  in  BG00012 
treated  subjects  compared  to  placebo.  In  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID  groups,  the  incidence  of 
events  in  the  skin  and  subcutaneous  disorders  SOC  was  highest  during  the  first  3  months  of  the 
studies (placebo: 10%, BG00012 BID: 19%, BG00012 TID: 20%, GA: 7%), then decreased during 
the  second  3  months  (placebo:  4%,  BG00012  BID:  7%,    BG00012  TID:  7%,  GA:  4%),  and 
continued  to  drop  during  the  subsequent  intervals  through  Month  24  (placebo:  2%  to  4%  , 
BG00012 BID: 2% to 7%, BG00012 TID:  3% to 5%, and GA: 2% to 3%).  
Infections 
Overall  the  incidence  of  infections  reported  as  an  adverse  event  was  56%  for  placebo  (469 
patients) and 60% for both BG00012 groups (463 patients for BID, 493 patients for TID). 
Cardiac related events 
Intensive monitoring for ischemic CV events was undertaken in the MS Phase 3 studies (109MS301 
and 109MS302). CV history and/or risk factors were collected at baseline. 
The incidences for cardiac disorder events were similar for all treatment groups (5% placebo, 5% 
BG00012  BID,  6%  BG00012  TID,  5%  GA).  Same  findings  were  noted  for  ischemic  related  events 
(cardiovascular  ischemia:  <1%  placebo,  1%  BG00012    BID,  <1%  BG00012  TID,  1%  GA, 
cerebrovascular ischemia: 1 subject each in the placebo, BG00012 BID and GA group, 2 subjects in 
the  BG00012  TID  group).  These  subjects  had  two  or  more  risk  factors.  ECG  changes  reported  as 
adverse events were low in all treatment groups (<1%). 
At the CHMP request, a pooled analysis using the pivotal studies (109MS301 and 109MS302) was 
provided  to  further  investigate  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  events  under  BG00012  treatment  in 
relation to existing cardiovascular risk factors at baseline. Results showed no evidence for a higher 
risk in patients treated with BG00012, regardless of the dose administered. The overall numbers of 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1

events  were  similar  in  all  treatment  and  dosing  groups  except  for  a  slightly  higher  AE  rate  for 
tachycardia and palpitations in patients with risk factors at baseline. 
Hepatic related events 
In Pool A, the incidence of hepatic adverse events was similar in all treatment groups (9% placebo 
vs.  9%  BG00012  BID,  10%  BG00012  TID,  and  11%  GA).  However,  in  the  BG00012  groups, 
elevations  of  liver  transaminases  were  most  frequently  reported  and  of  slightly  higher  incidence 
compared  to  placebo:  ALT  increased  (5%  placebo  vs.  6%  BG00012  BID  and  TID  and  GA  each), 
AST  increased  (2%  placebo  vs.  4%  BG00012  BID  and  TID  and  GA  each),  gamma-glutamyl 
transferase  (gamma-GT)  (2%  placebo  vs.  3%  BG00012  BID,  2%  BG00012  TID,  2%  GA),  and 
hepatic  enzyme  increased  (1%  placebo  vs.  <1%  BG00012  BID,  1%  BG00012  TID,  2%  GA). 
Hepatic  related  events  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  were  low  (<1%)  and  similar  in  all 
groups.  
Renal related events 
In Pool A, incidences of renal and urinary related adverse events were slightly higher in BG00012-
treated  subjects  compared  to  placebo  (18%  placebo  vs.  19%  BG00012  BID,  22%  BG00012  TID, 
17% GA). The most common AEs were: proteinuria (7% placebo, 9% BG00012 BID, 10% BG00012 
TID,  9%  GA),  haematuria  (4%  placebo,  4%  BG00012  BID,  5%  BG00012  TID,  3%  GA),  and 
microalbuminuria  (3%  placebo,  5%  BG00012  BID,  4%  BG00012  TID,  4%  GA).  In  the  majority  of 
subjects, the events were rated as mild or moderate in severity and related to dose. No increased 
treatment  discontinuations  in  patients  with  AEs  were  noted  (<1%  in  all  groups).  Of  note,  there 
were two subjects in the extension study 109MS303, who experienced a non-serious chronic renal 
failure.  Laboratory  tests  for  these  two  subjects  did  not  reveal  irregularities  indicative  for  renal 
failure. 
At the CHMP request, a pooled analysis separating the lower doses (BG00012 120 mg QD and 120 
mg TID) was provided to further investigate renal and urinary toxicity by comparing these doses to 
240 mg BID and 240 mg TID. A dose-relationship could not be confirmed for BG00012 treatment 
(0% to 22%) for BG00012 120 mg QD, 120 mg TID, 240 mg BID, and for 240 mg TID due to the 
high  incidence  of  these  events  in  the  placebo  group  (18%).  Although  less  AEs  were  reported  in 
study C-1900 due to different renal monitoring, combined data from phase II and III studies (Pool 
A) appeared to suggest a dose-related reporting of renal and urinary AEs. 
Malignancies 
Placebo-controlled studies revealed a malignancy rate for BG00012 BID and TID similar to that of 
placebo  and  GA  (<1%  [3  subjects]  placebo,  <1%  [2  subjects]  BG00012  BID,  <1%  [2  subjects] 
BG00012 TID, 1% [4 subjects] GA). Malignancies included breast cancer, basal cell skin carcinoma, 
and breast neoplasm in the placebo group; transitional cell carcinoma of renal pelvis and basal cell 
skin  carcinoma  in  the  BG00012  BID  group;  breast  cancer  and  cervix  cancer  in  the  BG00012  TID 
group; and cervix cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, and basal cell skin carcinoma in the 
GA group.  
In the uncontrolled extension studies, eight additional BG00012-treated subjects with malignancies 
were  reported.  Of  those  subjects,  one  was  treated  in  study  C-1900  for  11  months  with  BG00012 
(breast cancer), 2 were treated for the first time with BG00012 in study 109MS303 (breast cancer 
in  situ;  rectal  cancer),  and  5  subjects  received  continued  treatment  with  BG00012  in  study 
109MS303  (cutaneous  malignant  melanoma  in  two  subjects;  papillary  renal  cell  carcinoma, 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  and  salivary  gland  cancer  in  one  subject  each).  For  Pool  B 
(controlled  and  uncontrolled  studies),  malignancies  were  reported  in  0.4%  of  subjects  from  the 
BG00012 BID group and in 0.5% of subjects from the BG00012 TID group. 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 85/126 
 
  
  
  
 
In the overall clinical MS program, there were 3 malignancies in placebo-treated subjects compared 
to  12  malignancies  in  BG00012-treated  subjects  and  4  malignancies  in  GA-treated  subjects.  Ten 
(10) of the 12 BG00012 malignancies were first reported after 12 months of being on BG00012 in 
the study. 
Suicide and depression 
In Pool A, these events (including depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, completed suicide) 
occurred in a low and similar incidence across different treatment groups. 
2.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events  
In  Pool  A,  SAEs  occurred  in  a  similar  incidence  in  all  treatment  groups:  21%  placebo,  18% 
BG00012  BID,  15%  BG00012  TID,  and  17%  GA,  with  MS  relapse  being  the  most  frequently 
mentioned serious AE (14% placebo, 10% BG00012 BID, 8% BG00012 TID, and 10% GA).  
Flushing related events 
Serious  flushing  events  occurred  in  a  low  number  in  BG00012  240mg  BID-  and  TID-treated 
subjects (<1% each) and all patients recovered after treatment discontinuation. However, in three 
of the four SAEs, flushing was suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions rather than the severe end 
of  the  spectrum  of  the  flushing  known  to  be  caused  by  BG00012.  All  three  of  these  patients 
required hospital treatment including parenteral steroids. Hypotension was reported in one patient 
and  another  patient  had  shortness  of  breath.  These  findings  were  considered  as  a  clear  indicator 
that the clinical diagnosis was probable hypersensitivity reaction of clinically important severity. 
GI related events 
Serious  GI  events  happened  in  <1%  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  in  1%  of  BG00012-treated 
subjects each. The incidence of serious GI events was slightly higher with BG00012 treatment than 
with  placebo  (Study  109MS301:  <1%  placebo,  1%  BG00012  BID,  1%  BG00012  TID;  Study 
109MS302:  <1%  placebo,  <1%  BG00012  BID,  1%  BG00012  TID,  0%  GA).  Patients  recovered 
following treatment discontinuation or with intervention on continued treatment. .  
Skin related events 
Serious  skin  events  were  low  and  similar  in  all  treatment  groups:  one  patient  from  the  placebo 
group  experienced  allergic  dermatitis  in  study  109MS301.  One  Stevens  -  Johnson  syndrome 
occurred  in  study  109MS301  in  a  BG00012  BID  treated  subject  with  concomitant  carbamazepine. 
Two further subjects on BG00012 TID suffered from a skin-related event, one in study 109MS301 
(pruritus; flushing), and one in study 109MS303 with allergic dermatitis.  
Infections 
SAEs  reports  related  to  infections  were  33  out  of  1720  patients  for  BG00012  (1.92%),  compared 
with  12  out  of  836  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (1.44%),  representing  a  33%  increase  for  the 
BG00012  group  compared  to  placebo.  The  numbers  were  rather  low  and  the  significance  of  such 
difference  is  not  known.  In  the  individual  studies,  the  incidence  and  nature  of  serious  infections 
was similar in placebo and BG00012-treated patients (Study 109MS301: 2% in each group; Study 
109MS302: 1% placebo, 2% BG00012 BID, 2% BG00012 TID, 1% GA). In both studies the most 
common  type  of  serious  infection  was  gastroenteritis  (Study  109MS301:  0%  placebo,  <1% 
BG00012  BID,  <1%  BG00012  TID;  Study  109MS302:  0%  placebo,  <1%  BG00012  BID,  <1% 
BG00012  TID,  0%  GA).  The  excess  incidence  of  gastroenteritis  as  an  SAE  in  BG00012-treated 
patients over placebo was apparent. Excluding gastroenteritis, the incidence of infections as SAEs 
was  the  same  in  the  BG00012  and  placebo  groups.  Infective  illness  SAEs  did  not  seem  to  be 
related to leukopenia or lymphopenia.

Cardiac related events 
Serious  cardiac  disorder  events  were  low  but  occurred  in  the  BG00012  TID  group  only  (0% 
placebo, 0% BG00012 BID, <1% BG00012 TID). One subject in the placebo group and one in the 
BG00012  TID  group  experienced  significant  ischemic  cardiac  events.  In  the  uncontrolled  study 
109MS303,  three  additional  potential  ischemic  cases  were  reported,  one  was  rated  a  significant 
ischemic event (acute MI).  
In  Pool  D,  serious  potential  ischemic  CV  events  occurred  in  7  (2%)  of  subjects  treated  with 
BG00012.  Five  subjects  had  confirmed  or  suspected  myocardial  infarction  and  two  subjects  had 
coronary  artery  disease.  Six  of  seven  subjects  experienced  these  events  in  the  uncontrolled 
setting. Six subjects were male and one female. Risk factors or a history of cardiac ischemia were 
described for all subjects. Five of these subjects recovered after hospitalization and two died (acute 
myocardial infarction and sudden death). Causality could not be drawn since psoriasis patients are 
known  to  be  at  higher  risk  for  myocardial  infarction  and  CV  mortality  compared  to  the  general 
population. 
Hepatic related events 
Serious  hepatic  adverse  events  were  reported  for  two  placebo-treated  patients  (hepatic  enzyme 
increased),  in  one  female  subject  (cholestatic  hepatitis;  history  of  hyperbilirubinemia),  and  in 
another  female  subject  (cholelithiasis;  Study  109MS301)  both  receiving  BG00012  BID.  In  Pool  B, 
two  additional  serious  hepatic  events  were  noted,  one  of  these  events  being  a  suicide  due  to 
paracetamol overdose.  
Renal related events 
The incidence of serious renal and urinary  AEs  was  low (<1%) in all groups and no serious AE of 
renal failure was reported. 
Suicide and depression  
Serious adverse events with respect to depression and suicidal tendencies were rare and balanced 
across groups.  
Deaths 
A total of seven deaths were reported in the BG00012 clinical program with five deaths belonging 
to  the  BG00012  groups.  Five  of  these  deaths  happened  in  the  controlled  studies  109MS301  and 
109MS302,  and  two  further  deaths  were  reported  in  the  uncontrolled  setting  (study  109MS303). 
Two of the five deaths from BG00012-treated subjects occurred due to road traffic accidents, one 
death was a completed suicide and two deaths resulted from MS relapse. No death was considered 
to be related to the study drug. Nevertheless, the two MS relapse deaths may have occurred due 
to a lack of efficacy of BG00012. 
2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters 
The  predominant  findings  were  a  decrease  in  white  blood  cells  (WBC)  and  lymphocyte  counts  in 
BG00012-treated patients compared to placebo.  
Mean WBC counts were reduced from baseline following Week 4 through Week 48, with a plateau 
through Week 96 for BG00012 BID in Pool A (baseline: 6.93 x 109/L, Week 48: 5.96 x 109/L; mean 
percentage: 11%). Similar numbers were observed for BG00012 TID. Placebo and GA values were 
well above those for BG00012 (approximately 6.9 x 109/L for each time point for placebo and GA). 
At  all  time  points,  mean  WBC  values  remained  above  LLN.  Potentially  clinically  significant  WBC

counts  <3.0  x  109/L  were  higher  in  the  BG00012  groups  compared  to  placebo  and  GA  (1% 
placebo, 7% BG00012 BID, 5% BG00012 TID, 2% GA).  
Lymphocytes similarly decreased from baseline following Week 4 through Week 48, with a plateau 
through Week 96 for BG00012 BID in Pool A (baseline: 1.97 x 109/L, Week 48: 1.34 x 109/L; mean 
percentage:  30%).  Reduction  for  lymphocytes  in  the  BG00012  TID  group  was  similar  but  less 
pronounced  (baseline:  1.99  x  109/L,  Week  48:  1.44  x  109/L),  resulting  in  a  mean  percentage 
decrease  from  baseline  of  25%  at  Week  48.  Again,  lymphocyte  counts  in  both  BG00012  groups 
were  lower  than  in  the  placebo  or  GA  group  (approximately  1.9  x  109/L  for  each  time  point  for 
placebo  and  GA).  At  all  time  points,  mean  lymphocyte  counts  remained  above  LLN.  For 
lymphocytes,  more  subjects  in  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID  groups  (28%  and  21%,  respectively) 
than in the placebo group (3%) had a potentially clinically significant abnormal value <0.8 × 109/L; 
6% and 3% of subjects in the BG00012 BID and TID groups, respectively and <1% in the placebo 
group  had  lymphocyte  counts  <0.5  ×  109/L.  With  GA,  the  incidence  in  these  2  categories  of 
abnormal values (<0.8 and <0.5 × 109/L) was similar to placebo.  
In  133  MS  subjects  (studies  109MS301/109MS302)  ,  who  completed  2  years  of  BG00012 
treatment, the mean percentage decrease of lymphocytes at the last value of BG00012-treatment 
was 31.3% and changed to 25.6% at 4 weeks post last dose. In 130 MS subjects, who completed 1 
year  of  BG00012  treatment  (C-1900),  89  subjects  received  lower  doses  of  BG00012,  the  mean 
percentage decrease of lymphocytes in these subjects at the last value of BG00012-treatment was 
28.2% and changed to 17.9% at 4 weeks post last dose. In Pool A (n=299) , the mean percentage 
decrease of lymphocytes in these subjects at the last value of BG00012-treatment was 22.6% and 
changed to 19.3% at 4 weeks post last dose. 
In  Pool  A,  there  was  also  an  increase  in  mean  values  for  eosinophils  between  baseline  (0.134  × 
109/L) and Week 4 (0.322 × 109/L) in the BG00012 BID group (compared to stable placebo values 
of 0.14 × 109/L). The increase from baseline was transient, with mean values returning to baseline 
(placebo levels) by Week 12. A similar transient increase in mean eosinophil counts from baseline 
(0.133 × 109/L) at Week 4 (0.282 × 109/L) was seen in the BG00012 TID group. Mean eosinophil 
values  for  GA-treated  subjects  also  increased  between  baseline  and  Week  8,  but  this  was  less 
pronounced.  
Liver function tests 
ALT and AST mean values increased from baseline with BG00012 compared to placebo. The highest 
increase in ALT occurred at Week 4. Baseline mean values for ALT were 20.9 U/L for placebo and 
21.4 U/L for BG00012 BID. At Week 4, mean ALT increased to 21.4 U/L in the placebo and to 32.8 
U/L in the BG00012 BID group. In the BG00012 TID group, mean ALT exceeded the normal range 
(37.2  U/L)  at  Week  4.  Mean  ALT  values  returned  to  baseline  values  for  BG00012  BID  and  TID 
around Week 32 to 40. A similar trend was shown for AST: baseline mean values were 19.8 U/L for 
placebo  and  20.1  U/L  for  BG00012  BID-treated  subjects.  At  Week  4,  mean  values  increased  to 
24.9 U/L for BG00012 BID-treated subjects, whereas no increase was seen for the placebo group. 
ALT and AST maximum post-baseline values were classified to ≤1 x ULN, >1 x ULN, ≥3 x ULN, >5 
x ULN, >10 x ULN, and >20 x ULN. Most subjects from Pool A had post-baseline values of ALT and 
AST of <3 x ULN. ALT and AST maximum post-baseline values of ≥3 x ULN were detected for 5% 
and 2% in the placebo group, for 6% and 2% in each BG00012 group (BID and TID), and for 7% 
and 4% of subjects from the GA group. ALT and AST maximum post-baseline values of >5 x ULN 
were  low  and  similar  across  treatment  groups  (ALT:  2%  each  group;  AST:  <1-1%  each  group). 
Higher maximum post-baseline values were of rare incidence (<1%). There were no cases fulfilling 
Hy`s Law (ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN). 
Most  subjects  had  maximum  post-baseline  total  bilirubin  levels  of  ≤1  x  ULN  (90%-93%  across 
treatment groups) and 7%-10% of subjects across treatment groups had values of >1 x ULN.

Kidney function tests / Electrolytes 
No clinically notable changes in mean values for BUN or creatinine over time for BG00012 BID and 
TID groups were observed and no relevant differences from the placebo group were seen. Normal 
ranges  were  not  exceeded  by  mean  values  at  all  time  points  across  treatment  groups.  Shifts  to 
higher values were similar and low for these analytes. 
Analysis  of  minimum  post-baseline  values  of  eGFR  showed  that  the  incidence  of  subjects  with 
values consistent with mild renal impairment was, in fact, lower in the BG00012 240mg BID group 
compared  to  placebo  (46%  placebo,  29%  BG00012  BID,  24%  BG00012  TID,  47%  GA)  and  there 
was no increased incidence of moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. eGFR < 60) in minimum 
post baseline eGFR in the total BG00012 group (3% placebo, 3% BG00012 BID, 2% BG00012 TID, 
4% GA). The eGFR was also found to slightly increase over time (observation period of 2 years) for 
BG00012 compared to placebo, simultaneously, serum creatinine decreased. 
With  respect  to  electrolytes  (potassium,  sodium,  chloride,  bicarbonate),  more  subjects  in  the 
BG00012  BID  (16%)  and TID  (15%)  groups than  in  the placebo  (9%)  and  GA  (10%)  groups  had 
shifts to high bicarbonate in Pool A (percentages in Pool B were lower). 
Urinalysis 
Incidence of subjects with 2 positive urinalyses for protein was 47% for placebo, 51% for BG00012 
BID, 53% for BG00012 TID, and 56% for GA. There was no relevant difference in the incidence of 
subjects with 2 consecutively positive findings of proteinuria on urinalysis, and in the incidence of 
urinalysis with 3+ or 4+ protein in the different treatment groups. 
Elevated urine ketones were reported for BG00012-treated subjects compared to placebo and GA: 
21% BG00012 BID, 30% BG00012 TID, 5% placebo, and 4% GA. Shifts to high/positive values in 
the BG00012 BID and TID groups were 63% and 68% compared to 26% placebo for urine ketones. 
ß2-Microglobulin and microalbumin  
In  studies  109MS301,  109MS302  and  109MS303,  more  than  95%  [85%]  of  subjects  had  ß2-
microglobulin  [microalbumin]  values  within  the  normal  range  (≤0.29  mg/L)  [≤1.8  mg/dL]  at 
baseline  and  all  subsequent  time  points.  Subjects,  whose  values  of  ß2-microglobulin  or 
microalbumin  exceeded  the  normal  range,  remained  on  these  values  throughout  the  study.  A 
similar  incidence  of  shifts  to  high  urine  β2-microglobulin  was  observed  across  the  placebo, 
BG00012  BID  and  TID,  and  GA  groups  (9%  to  10%,  each  group)  based  on  pooled  data  from 
Studies  109MS301  and  109MS302.  A  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  both  the  BG00012  BID 
(36%)  and  TID  (37%)  groups  had  shifts  to  high  in  urine  microalbumin  when  compared  with 
placebo (29%) and GA (33%). 
Vital signs 
Body  temperature,  pulse,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure,  and  change  in  body  weight  were 
monitored. There was no information on a clinically significant difference in any of the vital signs or 
change  in  body  weight  described  of  BG00012,  placebo,  or  GA-treated  subjects.  ECGs  were  also 
performed at baseline and at 12-week intervals through Week 48 in study C-1900, and at baseline 
and every 24 weeks in studies 109MS301 and 109MS302. There were no relevant changes in QTc 
interval or any other quantitative or qualitative ECG parameters.  
Other parameters 
Serum  lipid  levels  (HDL,  LDL,  triglycerides)  were  monitored  in  studies  C-1900,  109MS301  and 
109MS302.  Favourable  effects  of  BG00012  over  placebo  and  GA  were  shown  producing  slightly 
higher  mean  HDL  and  lower  mean  triglyceride  levels  (the  same  was  shown  for  shifts  to  high/low 
values).

Parathyroid  hormone  and  Vitamin  D  levels  were  monitored  in  order  to  substantiate  preclinical 
findings  in  rats  with  renal  failure.  Studies  109MS301  and  109MS302  showed  increased  mean 
parathyroid  hormone  levels  from  Week  48  to  Week  96  and  decreased  Vitamin  D  levels  (-20%  of 
baseline values) in BG00012-treated subjects compared to placebo.  
In  a  subgroup  analysis, there  were  slightly  more  BG00012-treated  subjects  with  low  serum  1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin  D  levels  (<LLN)  or  elevated  serum  PTH  (>ULN)  compared  to  placebo  with 
proteinuria (8% placebo vs. 12% BG00012 240 mg BID and 12% BG00012 240 mg TID). Patient 
without low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels or without elevated serum PTH, had proteinuria 
in a similar percentage: 8% placebo vs. 8% BG00012 240 mg BID and 11% BG00012 240 mg TID. 
However, decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin levels were not observed in patients with ESRD. 
2.6.5.  Safety in special populations 
No  trials  have  been  performed  in  any  special  multiple  sclerosis  patient  populations.  Patient  with 
significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, psychiatric, neurologic (other 
than MS), renal impairment, hepatic conditions as well as HIV and Hepatitis C and B patients were 
excluded from the pivotal trials. 
Recommendations  for  patients  with  renal,  hepatic  impairment  and  other  special  populations 
(paediatric, elderly) are discussed under clinical pharmacology (see 2.4.4). 
In MS studies, females of child bearing potential were required to practice effective contraception. 
Nonetheless,  there  have  been  56  pregnancies  in  the  BG00012  clinical  development  program,  of 
which 38 pregnancies were reported in subjects exposed to BG00012 (37 subjects with MS and 1 
healthy  volunteer)  as  of  02  January  2013.  Pregnancy  outcomes  were  known  for  34  of  the 
BG00012-exposed  subjects  and  included  22  live  births,  3  spontaneous  abortions,  and  9  elective 
terminations;  information  was  pending  on  3  pregnancies  and  1  subject  was  lost  to  follow-up.  No 
foetal abnormalities (i.e. congenital defects) have been reported for any of the pregnancies in the 
BG00012 clinical program. 
2.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific investigation has been conducted in MS patient populations. 
In  Pool  A,  there  was  a  higher  number  of  patients  with  concomitant  nephrotoxic  medication 
suffering  from  renal  and  urinary  adverse  events  compared  to  those  patients  who  did  not  receive 
potentially nephrotoxic drugs: incidence of AEs with PNM: 21% placebo, 25% BG00012 BID, 26% 
BG00012 TID, 25% GA: without PNM: 16% placebo, 15% BG00012 BID, 18% BG00012 TID, 11% 
GA. 
In  Pool  A,  a  significant  percentage  of  AEs  were  also  reported  by  all  subjects  treated  with  IV 
corticosteroids  (100%)  and  by  most  subjects  not  treated  with  IV  corticosteroids  (placebo,  87%; 
BG00012  BID,  94%;  BG00012  TID,  91%).  A  slight  increase  in  the  rate  of  infections  could  be 
observed  in  subjects  treated  with  IV  corticosteroids  compared  to  subjects  treated  without  i.v. 
corticosteroids  (59%  [54%]  placebo,  63%  [59%]  BG00012  BID,  66%  [58%]  BG00012  TID,  and 
55% [47%] GA), for all treatment groups. A protective effect of corticosteroids was found for AEs 
related  to  flushing,  which  were  reported  by  27%  of  BG00012  BID-treated  subjects  versus  8%  of 
placebo-treated subjects, while among subjects without IV corticosteroids flushing was reported by 
37% of BG00012 BID-treated subjects versus 3% of placebo-treated subjects.

2.6.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  Pool  A,  discontinuations  from  study  treatment  due  to  AEs  were  slightly  higher  in  BG00012-
treated  subjects  compared  to  placebo  and  GA  (11%  placebo,  14%  BG00012  240mg  BID  and  TID 
each,  and  10%  GA).  The  most  common  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  from  treatment  was  MS 
relapse (placebo 6% vs. 1% BG00012 240mg BID, 2% BG00012 240mg TID and 2% GA).  
Adverse  events  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  with  higher  incidences  in  BG00012-treated 
subjects compared to placebo and GA were reported for GI disorders (<1% placebo, 4% BG00012 
BID,  6%  BG00012  TID,  <1%  GA),  flushing  (<1%  placebo,  3%  BG00012  BID,  2%  BG00012  TID, 
0% GA), and for skin and subcutaneous disorders (<1% placebo, 2% BG00012 BID, 2% BG00012 
TID, <1% GA). Other adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were most of all single 
cases. Similar findings were noted for Pool B. 
AEs  that  led  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  happened  in  a  higher  percentage  in  BG00012  treated 
subjects compared to placebo and GA (4% placebo, 8% BG00012 BID and TID each, and 3% GA). 
The  pattern  of  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  was  similar  to  that  observed  for  AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment.  
Regarding  the  overall  discontinuation  reasons,  the  only  differences  in  treatment  discontinuations 
between placebo and BG00012 groups were MS relapse (higher for placebo-treated subjects) and 
adverse  events  (higher  for  BG00012-treated  subjects).  Data  from  studies  109MS301  and 
109MS302 indicated a higher discontinuation rate for patients on BG00012 compared to placebo for 
the  first  year  (the  first  three  months)  of  treatment.  This  may  be  associated  with  occurrence  of 
flushing and GI events which were highest during the first months of treatment. 
In  Pool  A,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  reductions  was  higher  in  the  BG00012 
groups (10% each) compared to the placebo group (2%). Higher incidences for dose interruptions 
due  to  laboratory  abnormalities  or  AEs  were  also  found  for  the  BG00012  groups  as  compared  to 
placebo (13-15% compared to 9%). 
2.6.8.  Post marketing experience 
BG00012  has  not  been  approved  or  marketed  in  any  countries.  Safety  experience  was  made 
available  on  a  medicinal  product  which  contains  dimethyl  fumarate  as  one  of  its  active  substance 
component and marketed in Germany (Fumaderm).  
In  general,  the  adverse  event  profile  for  BG00012  and  Fumaderm  was  similar,  however  hepatic 
adverse events were not seen as strongly indicative of a causal association with treatment. 
There  were  three  subjects  on  Fumaderm,  who  experienced  PML  (progressive  multifocal 
leukencephalopathy).  Two  of  the  three  subjects  had  risk  factors  (efalizumab  treatment  and 
malignancy, sarcoidosis treated with methotrexate and steroids). There was 1 case of PML without 
clear risk factors in 174,000 person-years of Fumaderm exposure (as of September 2012).  During 
this  evaluation,  an  additional  case  of  PML  was  reported  by  the  applicant  in  December  2012.  This 
case was reported for a compounded formulation containing dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and another 
fumarate  (copper  monoethylfumarate),  the  patient  was  on  treatment  for  6  to  7  years.      Severe 
lymphopenia was detected in all of these patients.  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile of  DMF has  been  characterised  with  data  from  2560  RRMS  patients,  accounting 
for around 3600 person-years of exposure. A total of 1469 subjects have been exposed for ≥1 year 
and 1095 for (≥2 years) at or above the recommended dose.

In  MS  clinical  studies,  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  slightly  higher  for  BG00012 
compared to controls (placebo or glatiramer acetate, GA) and ranged between 87-95% of subjects 
in all treatment groups.  
The system organ class (SOC) with the highest proportion of patients with AEs was infections and 
infestations  with  an  incidence  of  AEs  slightly  higher  for  subjects  from  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID 
group  (60%  each)  compared  to  subjects  from  the  placebo  and  GA  group  (56%  and  50%). 
Infections  with  the  highest  occurrence  were  nasopharyngitis,  urinary  tract  infection,  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection,  influenza,  sinusitis,  bronchitis,  and  gastroenteritis.  Serious  infections 
were low in occurrence with gastroenteritis being the most common infection. 
The safety profile indicated flushing,  GI events and  decreases in WBC and lymphocytes counts as 
important identified risks.  
Serious  cardiac  disorder  events  were  low  but  occurred  in  the  BG00012  TID  group  only  (0% 
placebo, 0% BG00012 BID, <1% BG00012 TID). One subject in the placebo group and one in the 
BG00012  TID  group  experienced  significant  ischemic  cardiac  events.  In  the  uncontrolled  study 
109MS303,  three  additional  potential  ischemic  cases  were  reported,  one  was  rated  a  significant 
ischemic  event  (acute  MI).  In  Pool  D,  serious  potential ischemic  CV  events  occurred  in  7  (2%) of 
subjects treated with BG00012. Five subjects had confirmed or suspected myocardial infarction and 
two  subjects  had  coronary  artery  disease.  Six  of  seven  subjects  experienced  these  events  in  the 
uncontrolled  setting.  Risk  factors  or  a  history  of  cardiac  ischemia  were  described  for  all  subjects. 
Five of these subjects recovered after hospitalization and two died (acute myocardial infarction and 
sudden death). Causality could not be drawn since psoriasis patients are known to be at higher risk 
for  myocardial  infarction  and  CV  mortality  compared  to  the  general  population.  Of  note,  patients 
with  significant  cardiovascular  conditions  were  excluded  from  the  clinical  studies.  According  to 
CHMP  request,  a  pooled  analysis  using  the  pivotal  studies  was  provided to  further  investigate  the 
risk  of  cardiovascular  events  under  BG00012  treatment  in  relation  to  existing  cardiovascular  risk 
factors at baseline. Results showed no evidence for a higher risk in patients treated with BG00012, 
regardless  of  the  dose  administered.  The  overall  numbers  of  events  were  similar  in  all  treatment 
and dosing groups except for a slightly higher AE rate for tachycardia and palpitations in patients 
with risk factors at baseline.  Single doses of DMF did not affect the QTc interval. 
Flushing  and  related  symptoms  (hot  flush,  erythema,  generalized  erythema,  burning  sensation, 
skin burning,  feeling hot and hyperaemia) were reported with an overall 5-times higher incidence 
in BG00012 BID/TID-treated subjects compared to placebo and GA.  These events were associated 
with  a  prostanglandin  mediated  mechanism.  The  incidence  of  flushing  (including  hot  flush)  and 
related symptoms was highest during the first 3 months of the studies, with a peak in Month 1 (6% 
placebo vs. 36% BG00012 BID, 35% BG00012 TID). The overall prevalence for flushing was 31% 
during the first month, dropping to about 24% in the second month, and only slightly if at all less 
in subsequent months. In three of the serious flushing events patients required hospital treatment 
including  parenteral  steroids,  hypotension  was  reported  in  one  patient  and  another    patient  had 
shortness  of  breath.  These  findings  seemed  a  clear  indicator  that  the  clinical  diagnosis  was 
probable  hypersensitivity  reaction  of  clinically  important  severity.  This  information  has  been 
considered a relevant warning for the prescribers and was included in the SmPC. 
GI  disorders  (diarrhoea,  nausea,  upper  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  dyspepsia, 
gastroenteritis,  GI  disorder)  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  BG00012-treated  subjects 
compared to placebo and GA and occurred with a higher incidence during the first three months of 
BG00012 treatment. These AEs seem to settle down more than flushing, with overall prevalence in 
BG00012 BID and TID-treated subjects of 22 and 25% in the first month, 17 and 16% during the 
second  month,  and  6-12%  and  8-12%  in  subsequent  months.The  mechanism  of  GI  events  is 
unknown and is intended to be further investigated as part of the Risk Management Plan.

WBC  counts  and  lymphocytes  decreased  (not  so  in  the  placebo  and  GA  group)  from  Week  4  to 
Week 48 in BG00012-treated subjects and with a plateau through Week 96. Mean decrease for the 
first  year  was  11%  and  30%  for  WBC  counts  and  lymphocyte  counts.  No  corresponding  serious 
infection  was  reported  for  clinically  significant  low  lymphocyte  counts.  However,  potentially 
clinically  significant  WBC  counts  <3.0  x  109/L  were  higher  in  the  BG00012  groups  compared  to 
placebo  and  GA  (1%  placebo,  7%  BG00012  BID,  5%  BG00012  TID,  2%  GA).  For  lymphocytes, 
more  subjects  in  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID  groups  (28%  and  21%,  respectively)  than  in  the 
placebo  group  (3%)  had  a  potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  value  <0.8  ×  109/L;  6%  and 
3%  of  subjects  in  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID  groups,  respectively  and  <1%  in  the  placebo  group 
had  lymphocyte  counts  <0.5  ×  109/L.  With  GA,  the  incidence  in  these  2  categories  of  abnormal 
values  (<0.8  and  <0.5  ×  109/L)  was  similar  to  placebo.  Analyses  were  performed  and  showed 
evidence  for  slight  recovery  of  lymphocytes  4  weeks  post  dose  (after  study  treatment 
discontinuation  or  completion).  Nevertheless,  these  data  were  considered  inconclusive,  since  the 
observation  period  was  short.  The  CHMP  therefore  requested  a  specific  study  to  investigate  the 
effects  of  BG00012  on  the  immune  response.  This  will  include  further  data  in  relation  to 
vaccination,  lymphocyte  subsets  and  immunoglobulin  levels  in  RRMS  patients.  In  addition,  the 
SmPC  recommends  a  complete  blood  count  (i.e.  within  6 months)  prior  to  initiating  treatment, 
after 6 months of treatment and every 6 to 12 months thereafter and as clinically indicated.  
Renal and urinary adverse events were slightly increased with BG00012 treatment: 18% placebo, 
19%  BG00012  BID,  22%  BG00012  TID,  17%  GA).  The  most  common  AE  in  this  SOC  was 
proteinuria: 7% placebo, 9% BG00012 BID, 10% BG00012 TID, 9% GA.  In addition, an increased 
incidence for renal and urinary AEs in patients receiving nephrotoxic medications (PNM) was noted. 
Hepatic adverse events were also slightly increased with BG00012 treatment and mainly comprised 
increased hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST) within the first 6 months of treatment. Renal and 
hepatic  toxicity  could  not  be  deduced  from  the  clinical  data  (small  increases  in  AEs),  however, 
animal  data  showed  renal  and  liver  toxicities  associated  with  BG00012  treatment  and  the 
underlying  mechanisms  have  not  been  confirmed.  The  CHMP  therefore  considered  renal  tubular 
injury  and  hepatic  injury  as  important  potential  risks  of  BG00012,  whereas  proteinuria  was 
considered as identified risk (derived from the postmarketing experience with Fumaderm). On the 
basis of the overall data on these events, the CHMP recommended monitoring of these events prior 
to treatment initiation, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, every 6 to 12 months thereafter and as 
clinically indicated. 
Malignancies  reported  in  the  BG00012  groups  were  low  and  similar  to  placebo  and  GA  (breast 
cancer,  basal  cell  skin  carcinoma,  and  breast  neoplasm  in  the  placebo  group;  transitional  cell 
carcinoma of renal pelvis and basal cell skin carcinoma in the BG00012 BID group; breast cancer 
and  cervix  cancer  in  the  BG00012  TID  group;  and  cervix  cancer,  endometrial  cancer,  thyroid 
cancer, and basal cell skin carcinoma in the GA group). Eight additional malignancies were reported 
in  the  ongoing  study  109MS303.  Further  long  term  data,  included  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan, 
are expected to investigate this potential risk.  
In MS studies, females of child bearing potential were required to practice effective contraception. 
Nonetheless,  there  have  been  56  pregnancies  in  the  BG00012  clinical  development  program,  of 
which 38 pregnancies were reported in subjects exposed to BG00012 (37 subjects with MS and 1 
healthy  volunteer)  as  of  02  January  2013.  Pregnancy  outcomes  were  known  for  34  of  the 
BG00012-exposed  subjects  and  included  22  live  births,  3  spontaneous  abortions,  and  9  elective 
terminations;  information  was  pending  on  3  pregnancies  and  1  subject  was  lost  to  follow-up.  No 
foetal abnormalities (i.e. congenital defects) have been reported for any of the pregnancies in the 
BG00012 clinical program. A Pregnancy Exposure Registry has been put in place to monitor the use 
in this special population.

Four  PML  cases  were  reported  on  products  containing  DMF.  Two  of  the  three  subjects  had  risk 
factors. There was 1 case of PML without clear risk factor. An additional case of PML was reported 
for  a  compounded  formulation  containing  DMF;  the  patient  was  on  treatment  for  6  to  7  years.  
Severe  lymphopenia  was detected in  all of  these  patients.  Because  the  DMF mechanism  on  MS  is 
not completely understood, the CHMP recommended that PML should be considered as a potential 
risk. 
In  addition,  according  to  the  discussion  on  clinical  pharmacology  (see  2.4.4),  a  drug  interaction 
study with oral contraceptives will be performed. Data from the ongoing study evaluating effects of 
aspirin  or  dose  titration  on  flushing  and  gastrointestinal  events  following  oral  administration  of 
BG00012 will be provided to further address these AEs. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the  SmPC.  Appropriate  measures  including  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  risk 
minimization  activities  (see  2.8)  have  been  put  in  place  to  ensure  safe  and  effective  use  of  the 
product in the recommended indication. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.

initiating treatment. Upon treatment with 
TECFIDERA, mean lymphocyte counts decreased 
over the first year with a subsequent plateau. 
On average, lymphocyte counts decreased by 
approximately 30% of baseline value. Mean and 
median lymphocyte counts remained within 
normal limits. Lymphocyte counts <0.5x109/l 
were observed in <1% of patients treated with 
placebo and 6% of patients treated with 
TECFIDERA. A lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l was 
observed in 1 patient treated with TECFIDERA 
and in no patients treated with placebo. The 
incidence of infections (58% versus 60%) and 
serious infections (2% versus 2%) was similar 
in patients treated with placebo or TECFIDERA. 
An increased incidence of infections and serious 
infections was not observed in patients with 
lymphocyte counts <0.8x109/l or 0.5x109/l. A 
transient increase in mean eosinophil counts 
was seen during the first 2 months of therapy. 
SmPC Section 4.2 Posology and method of 
administration: 
Temporary dose reduction to 120 mg twice a 
day may reduce the occurrence of flushing and 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Within 1 
month, the recommended dose of 240 mg twice 
a day should be resumed. 
TECFIDERA should be taken with food (see 
section 5.2).  
For those patients who may experience flushing 
or gastrointestinal adverse reactions, taking 
TECFIDERA with food may improve tolerability 
(see section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). 
SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions: 
Flushing 
In clinical trials, 40% of TECFIDERA treated 
patients experienced flushing. In the majority of 
patients who experienced flushing, it was mild 
or moderate in severity and occurred on 
initiation of treatment.  
In clinical trials, 3 patients out of a total of 2560 
patients treated with TECFIDERA experienced 
serious flushing symptoms that were probable 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions. 
These events were not life-threatening but led 
to hospitalisation. Prescribers and patients 
should be alert to this possibility in the event of 
severe flushing reactions (see section 4.2, 4.5 
and 4.8).

However, long term use of aspirin is not 
recommended for the management of flushing. 
Potential risks associated with aspirin therapy 
should be considered prior to co-administration 
with TECFIDERA. (see section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).  
SmPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects: 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence 
≥10%) for patients treated with TECFIDERA 
were flushing and gastrointestinal events (i.e. 
diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal 
pain upper). Flushing and gastrointestinal 
events tend to begin early in the course of 
treatment (primarily during the first month) and 
in patients who experience flushing and 
gastrointestinal events, these events may 
continue to occur intermittently throughout 
treatment with TECFIDERA. The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions leading to 
discontinuation (incidence >1%) in patients 
treated with TECFIDERA were flushing (3%) and 
gastrointestinal events (4%). 
Flushing 
In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence 
of flushing (35% versus 4%) and hot flush (7% 
versus 2%) was increased in patients treated 
with TECFIDERA compared to placebo, 
respectively. Flushing is usually described as 
flushing or hot flush, but can include other 
events (e.g. warmth, redness, itching, and 
burning sensation). Flushing events tend to 
begin early in the course of treatment (primarily 
during the first month) and in patients who 
experience flushing, these events may continue 
to occur intermittently throughout treatment 
with TECFIDERA. In patients with flushing, the 
majority had flushing events that were mild or 
moderate in severity. Overall, 3% of patients 
treated with TECFIDERA discontinued due to 
flushing. The incidence of serious flushing, 
which may be characterised by generalised 
erythema, rash and/or pruritus, was seen in less 
than 1% of patients treated with TECFIDERA 
(see section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).

TECFIDERA has not been studied in patients 
with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment 
and caution should therefore be used in these 
patients (see section 4.2). 
SmPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects:   
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence 
≥10%) for patients treated with TECFIDERA 
were flushing and gastrointestinal events (i.e. 
diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal 
pain upper). Flushing and gastrointestinal 
events tend to begin early in the course of 
treatment (primarily during the first month) and 
in patients who experience flushing and 
gastrointestinal events, these events may 
continue to occur intermittently throughout 
treatment with TECFIDERA. The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions leading to 
discontinuation (incidence >1%) in patients 
treated with TECFIDERA were flushing (3%) and 
gastrointestinal events (4%). 
Gastrointestinal 
The incidence of gastrointestinal events (e.g. 
diarrhoea [14% versus 10%], nausea [12% 
versus 9%], upper abdominal pain [10% versus 
6%], abdominal pain [9% versus 4%], vomiting 
[8% versus 5%] and dyspepsia [5% versus 
3%]) was increased in patients treated with 
TECFIDERA compared to placebo, respectively. 
Gastrointestinal events tend to begin early in 
the course of treatment (primarily during the 
first month) and in patients who experience 
gastrointestinal events, these events may 
continue to occur intermittently throughout 
treatment with TECFIDERA. In the majority of 
patients who experienced gastrointestinal 
events, it was mild or moderate in severity. Four 
per cent (4%) of patients treated with 
TECFIDERA discontinued due to gastrointestinal 
events. The incidence of serious gastrointestinal 
events, including gastroenteritis and gastritis, 
was seen in 1% of patients treated with 
TECFIDERA (see section 4.2).

Infections 
In phase III placebo-controlled studies, the 
incidence of infections (60% vs 58%) and 
serious infections (2% vs 2%) was similar in 
patients treated with TECFIDERA or placebo, 
respectively. There was no increased incidence 
of serious infections observed in patients with 
lymphocyte counts <0.8x109/L or <0.5x109/L. 
During treatment with TECFIDERA in the MS 
placebo controlled trials, mean lymphocyte 
counts decreased by approximately 30% from 
baseline at one year and then plateaued (see 
section 4.8). Mean lymphocyte counts remained 
within normal limits. If a patient develops a 
serious infection, suspending treatment with 
TECFIDERA should be considered and the 
benefits and risks should be reassessed prior to 
re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving 
TECFIDERA should be instructed to report 
symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients 
with serious infections should not start 
treatment with TECFIDERA until the infection(s) 
is resolved.

SmPC section 5.3 Preclinical safety data: 
Carcinogenesis 
Carcinogenicity studies of dimethyl fumarate 
were conducted for up to 2 years in mice and 
rats. Dimethyl fumarate was administered orally 
at doses of 25, 75, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day in 
mice, and at doses of 25, 50, 100, and 150 
mg/kg/day in rats. In mice, the incidence of 
renal tubular carcinoma was increased at 75 
mg/kg/day, at equivalent exposure (AUC) to the 
recommended human dose. In rats, the 
incidence of renal tubular carcinoma was 
increased at 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 3 
times higher exposure than the recommended 
human dose. The relevance of these findings to 
human risk is unknown. 
The incidence of squamous cell papilloma and 
carcinoma in the nonglandular stomach 
(forestomach) was increased at equivalent 
exposure to the recommended human dose in 
mice and below exposure to the recommended 
human dose in rats (based on AUC). The 
forestomach in rodents does not have a human 
counterpart. 
SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use: 
Changes in renal and hepatic laboratory tests 
have been seen in clinical trials in subjects 
treated with TECFIDERA (see section 4.8). The 
clinical implications of these changes are 
unknown. Assessments of renal function (e.g. 
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) 
are recommended prior to treatment initiation, 
after 3 and 6 months of treatment, and every 6 
to 12 months thereafter and as clinically 
indicated. Assessments of hepatic function (e.g. 
ALT and AST) are also recommended prior to 
treatment initiation, after 3 and 6 months of 
treatment, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter.

hepatic transaminases were observed. The 
majority of patients with elevations had hepatic 
transaminases that were <3 times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN). The increased incidence 
of elevations of hepatic transaminases in 
patients treated with TECFIDERA relative to 
placebo was primarily seen during the first 6 
months of treatment. Elevations of alanine 
aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase ≥3 times ULN, respectively, 
were seen in 5% and 2% of patients treated 
with placebo and 6% and 2% of patients treated 
with TECFIDERA. There were no elevations in 
transaminases ≥3 times ULN with concomitant 
elevations in total bilirubin >2 times ULN. 
Discontinuations due to elevated hepatic 
transaminases were <1% and similar in patients 
treated with TECFIDERA or placebo. 
SmPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects:  
Undesirable effect: Ketones measured in urine 
Frequency category: Very common 
Laboratory abnormalities 
In the placebo-controlled studies, measurement 
of urinary ketones (1+ or greater) was higher in 
patients treated with TECFIDERA (44%) 
compared to placebo (10%). No untoward 
clinical consequences were observed in clinical 
trials.

studies have not been performed with oral

not expected, non hormonal contraceptive 
measures should be considered with TECFIDERA 
(see section 4.6). 
SmPC section 4.6 Pregnancy: 
There are no or limited amount of data from the 
use of dimethyl fumarate in pregnant women. 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). TECFIDERA is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women 
of childbearing potential not using approriate 
contraception (see section 4.5). TECFIDERA 
should be used during pregnancy only if clearly 
needed and if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
SmPC section 5.3 Preclinical safety data: 
Reproduction toxicity 
Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate to 
male rats at 75, 250, and 375 mg/kg/day prior 
to and during mating had no effects on male 
fertility up to the highest dose tested (at least 2 
times the recommended dose on an AUC basis). 
Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate to 
female rats at 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day 
prior to and during mating, and continuing to 
Day 7 of gestation, induced reduction in the 
number of estrous stages per 14 days and 
increased the number of animals with prolonged 
diestrus at the highest dose tested (11 times 
the recommended dose on an AUC basis). 
However, these changes did not affect fertility 
or the number of viable fetuses produced. 
Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to cross the 
placental membrane into fetal blood in rats and 
rabbits, with ratios of fetal to maternal plasma 
concentrations of 0.48 to 0.64 and 0.1 
respectively. No malformations were observed 
at any dose of dimethyl fumarate in rats or 
rabbits. Administration of dimethyl fumarate at 
oral doses of 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day to 
pregnant rats during the period of 
organogenesis resulted in maternal adverse 
effects at 4 times the recommended dose on an 
AUC basis, and low fetal weight and delayed 
ossification (metatarsals and hindlimb 
phalanges) at 11 times the recommended dose 
on an AUC basis. The lower fetal weight and 
delayed ossification were considered secondary 
to maternal toxicity (reduced body weight and 
food consumption).  
Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate at 25, 
75, and 150 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits 
during organogenesis had no effect on embryo-
fetal development and resulted in reduced 
maternal body weight at 7 times the

basis. 
Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate at 25, 
100, and 250 mg/kg/day to rats during 
pregnancy and lactation resulted in lower body 
weights in the F1 offspring, and delays in sexual 
maturation in F1 males at 11 times the 
recommended dose on an AUC basis. There 
were no effects on fertility in the F1 offspring. 
The lower offspring body weight was considered 
secondary to maternal toxicity. 
SmPC section 4.1 Therapeutic indications:

and did not include sufficient numbers of 
patients aged 65 and over to determine whether 
they respond differently than younger patients 
(see section 5.2). Based on the mode of action 
of the active substance there are no theoretical 
reasons for any requirement for dose 
adjustments in the elderly. 
SmPC section 4.2 Posology and method of 
administration:  
The safety and efficacy of TECFIDERA in children 
and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years have not 
been established in multiple sclerosis. No data 
are available. There is no relevant use of 
TECFIDERA in children aged less than 10 years

SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use:  
Blood/Laboratory tests 
Changes in renal and hepatic laboratory tests 
have been seen in clinical trials in subjects 
treated with TECFIDERA (see section 4.8). The 
clinical implications of these changes are 
unknown. Assessments of renal function (e.g. 
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) 
are recommended prior to treatment initiation, 
after 3 and 6 months of treatment, and every 6 
to 12 months thereafter and as clinically 
indicated. Assessments of hepatic function (e.g. 
ALT and AST) are also recommended prior to 
treatment initiation, after 3 and 6 months of 
treatment, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter.  
Severe renal and hepatic impairment 
TECFIDERA has not been studied in patients 
with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment 
and caution should therefore be used in these 
patients (see section 4.2). 
SmPC section 4.2 Posology:

Severe renal and hepatic impairment 
TECFIDERA has not been studied in patients 
with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment 
and caution should therefore be used in these 
patients (see section 4.2). 
SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use:  
TECFIDERA has not been studied in patients 
with severe active gastrointestinal disease and 
caution should therefore be used in these 
patients. 
SmPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects:  
Gastrointestinal 
The incidence of gastrointestinal events (e.g. 
diarrhoea [14% versus 10%], nausea [12% 
versus 9%], upper abdominal pain [10% versus 
6%], abdominal pain [9% versus 4%], vomiting 
[8% versus 5%] and dyspepsia [5% versus 
3%]) was increased in patients treated with 
TECFIDERA compared to placebo, respectively. 
Gastrointestinal events tend to begin early in 
the course of treatment (primarily during the 
first month) and in patients who experience 
gastrointestinal events, these events may 
continue to occur intermittently throughout 
treatment with TECFIDERA. In the majority of 
patients who experienced gastrointestinal 
events, it was mild or moderate in severity. Four 
per cent (4%) of patients treated with 
TECFIDERA discontinued due to gastrointestinal 
events. The incidence of serious gastrointestinal 
events, including gastroenteritis and gastritis, 
was seen in 1% of patients treated with 
TECFIDERA (see section 4.2). 
SmPC section 4.5 Interactions:  
TECFIDERA has not been studied in combination 
with anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive 
therapies and caution should therefore be used 
during concomitant administration. In multiple 
sclerosis clinical studies, the concomitant 
treatment of relapses with a short course of 
intravenous corticosteroids was not associated 
with a clinically relevant increase of infection. 
SmPC section 4.5 Interactions:  
Commonly used medicinal products in patients 
with multiple sclerosis, intramuscular interferon 
beta-a and glatiramer acetate, were clinically 
tested for potential interactions with TECFIDERA 
and did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of 
dimethyl fumarate.

These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
As part of additional pharmacovigilance activities, the RMP included study 109MS307 entitled:   
“A Randomized, Open-Label Study to Assess the Effects of BG00012 on the Immune Response to 
Vaccination and on Lymphocyte Subsets and Immunoglobulin Levels in Subjects with Relapsing 
Remitting Multiple Sclerosis” (109MS307)”.  
This study is currently linked to the safety concerns “Decreases in leukocyte and lymphocyte 
counts“ (identified risk) and “Serious and opportunistic infections” (potential risk).  
The  CHMP  recommended  including  reference  in  the  RMP  of  the  additional  SmPC  amendment 
requested after the PRAC advice was given. This relates to information in section 4.5 of the SmPC 
regarding data on vaccination in patients treated with DMF. Such information is recommended to 
be  included  in  the  RMP  as  “Important  Missing  Information”.  Cross  references  were  also 
recommended between the above mentioned safety concerns. In addition, the applicant proposed 
to  further  investigate  the  gastrointestinal  safety  profile  in  patients  consuming  strong  alcoholic 
drinks in the planned observational study (109MS401). See Table 29. The CHMP also requested to 
update the RMP (routine risk minimisation measures) in line with the final wording of the SmPC.

Taking  into  consideration  the  above,  a  revised  RMP  (version  5)  was  submitted  and  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.

The  results  of  the  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet  submitted 
by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.  New Active Substance Status 
By  a  letter  dated  18  September  2013,  the  European  Commission  (EC)  requested  the  CHMP  to 
assess  if  dimethyl  fumarate  is  different  from  Fumaderm  composed  of  dimethyl  fumarate,  calcium 
salt of ethyl fumarate, magnesium salt of ethyl hydrogen fumarate and zinc salt of ethyl hydrogen 
fumarate  with  a  view  to  include  an  assessment  of  the  new  active  substance  (‘NAS’)  status  of 
dimethylfumarate in Tecfidera, as per applicant request. A new active substance is defined in that 
context as a chemical substance not previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European 
Union  (Annex  I  to  the  Notice  to  Applicants  VOLUME  2A,  Procedures  for  marketing  authorisation, 
CHAPTER 1, MARKETING AUTHORISATIONS, June 2013). 
On  23  September  2013,  the  applicant  submitted  evidence  and  discussion  as  to  why  the  active 
substance of Tecfidera, dimethyl fumarate, should be regarded as ‘new’ in the light of the Annex I 
of the NtA - Chapter I. 
2.10.1.  Quality aspects 
For  the  decision  of  whether  dimethyl  fumarate  is  different  from  Fumaderm  composed of  dimethyl 
fumarate  (DMF),  calcium  salt  of  ethyl  fumarate,  magnesium  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate  and 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 109/126 
 
  
  
  
 
 
zinc  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate  (also  called  “monoethyl  fumarate  salts”),  the  following 
provision of Article 10(2)(b) has to be taken into account: 
“The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an 
active substance shall be considered to be the same active substance, unless they differ 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy”. 
Consequently, the chemical relationship of DMF and the monoethyl fumarate (MEF) salts should be 
taken into consideration. 
DMF and MEF are different esters of fumaric acid (FA): 
The chemical structures of the compounds under discussion are presented below:  
       DMF                    MEF Ca2+
                      MEF Mg2+
                         MEF Zn2+                     FA  
It  is  clear  that  DMF  and  MEF  contain  the  same  backbone  structure  of  fumaric  acid  (FA)  and  are 
different esters of fumaric acid. Although DMF and MEF are both esters of fumaric acid, this is of no 
relevance  because  Fumaric  acid  is  not  an  active  substance  (as  required  under  Article  10(2)(b) 
above) and is not itself authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union. 
DMF and MEF have different physicochemical properties: 
The  applicant  provided  data  on  DMF  and  MEF  with  regard  to  key  chemical  differences,  distinct 
physical properties, spectroscopic differences in solution, structural relationship and their chemical 
reactivity. The data support the conclusion that DMF and MEF are different esters with differential 
physicochemical  properties  including  their  molecular  weights,  melting  points  and  water  solubility, 
presented in the following table. 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 110/126 
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
As both DMF and MEF have shown to have pharmacological activity, it can be assumed that the two 
molecules may have different therapeutic moieties, i.e. dimethyl ester vs. mono-ethyl ester. 
The assessment of the quality aspects is supported by the clinical and non-clinical assessment (see 
below). 
Conclusions on quality aspects 
In summary, DMF and MEF can be regarded as pharmaceutically different molecules, with distinct 
differences  in  regard  to  spectroscopic  properties  in  solution,  structural  relationship,  chemical 
reactivity, molecular weights, melting points and water solubility. DMF and MEF are different esters 
of fumaric acid, which itself is not an active substance. 
Therefore, it is evident that DMF and the MEF salts are chemically distinct active substances. 
2.10.2.  Non Clinical aspects 
Non  clinical  data  on  the  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  DMF  and  the  MEF 
salts  components    were  presented  as  evidence  to  their  pharmacological  activities  and  different 
metabolic  pathways,  with  the  aim  of  supporting  that  the  composition  of  Fumaderm  (dimethyl 
fumarate and MEF salts) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) are different.  
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 111/126 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Pharmacodynamic activities of DMF and the MEF salts 
With  the  justification  of the  NAS  claim  for  DMF,  the applicant  submitted  new  data  to  substantiate 
the  pharmacological  activity  of  the  MEF  salts  contained  in  Fumaderm.  In  the in vitro  studies,  MEF 
salts were tested in a range of 0 – 12 µg/ml, which encompasses peak plasma concentrations that 
are known to occur in humans after oral dosing for MEF. Human concentrations are not known for 
fumaric  acid.  The  literature  indicates  that  after  receiving  a  dose  of  Fumaderm,  median  human 
plasma  exposures  of  MEF  were  5.2 µM,  which  equates  to  approximately  1 µg/ml  (Rostami-Yazdi 
et al.,  2010).  However,  plasma  concentrations  may  not  accurately  reflect  the  exposure  to  MEF  in 
certain  tissues  and  locally  in  the  intestinal  mucosa,  which  would  be  expected  to  be  much  higher 
based on the site of absorption. Consequently, higher concentrations were also tested in vitro. 
In all non-clinical studies, the ratio of the calcium, magnesium, and zinc salt mixtures of MEF was 
87:5:3 MEF-Ca2+, MEF-Mg2+, MEF-Zn2+, respectively, based on molecular weight. This reflects the 
ratio of the same MEF salts found in the Fumaderm product. 
Overall, the newly provided investigations showed: 
1) 
Induction of Nrf2 by either the individual Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ salts of MEF or a mixture of the three 
MEF salts in COS-1 cells in vitro. DMF and MMF similarly increased Nrf2 concentrations as analysed 
by Western blotting, whereas fumaric acid was ineffective (Figure 21).

2)  Covalent modification of Keap1 at Cys151 by a mixture of the Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ salts of MEF as 
investigated by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in HEK293 cells in vitro (Figure 22). 
The same modification of Keap1 at Cys151 had been previously demonstrated for DMF and MMF 
in vitro.

3)  Concentration-related induction of Nfr2-dependent gene expression by a mixture of the Ca2+, Mg2+ 
and Zn2+ salts of MEF in human astrocytes in vitro as evident by RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA 
levels of NQO1, haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), sulfiredoxin 1 (Srxn 1), thioredoxin reductase 1 
(Trxnd 1), oxidative stress-induced growth inhibitor 1 (Osgin 1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase 
catalytic subunit (Gclc). Fumaric acid was inactive to change expression of the evaluated genes 
in vitro. DMF and MMF were also stated to be active in this system, but no comparative data were 
provided. 
The transcriptional profiles obtained for the mixture of MEF salts differed for the individual genes: 
at a concentration of >3 µg/ml, the Trxnd 1 response plateaued, while the slope (degree of relative 
increase) of NQO1 and Srxn1 responses decreased (Figure 23). In contrast, responses for HO-1, 
Osgin 1 and Gclc exhibited a linear increase across the entire concentration range. These 
differential gene responses suggest additional regulatory processes also govern expression or 
stability of these transcripts. Moreover, the pharmacological activity of the MEF salts appears to 
reside within the fumaric ester as fumaric acid itself did not produce a response.

4) 
Induction of Nfr2-dependent gene expression by a mixture of the Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ salts of MEF 
in vivo.  C57Bl/6  mice  received  single or  repeated  oral  doses of  79.2 mg/kg  MEF  salts  for  10 days 
(equivalent to 100 mg/kg DMF). Fumaric acid was not tested due to its lack of activity in previous 
investigations in vitro (see above). Transcriptional responses were evaluated at 6 and 12 h after a 
single  dose,  and  12 h  after  the  last  dose  following  10 consecutive  days  of  once  daily  dosing 
(multiple  dosing  =  MD).  MEF  pharmacokinetics  were  also  assessed  in  plasma  and  tissues  in 
separate cohorts of animals to verify drug exposure in these experimental paradigms. 
Transcriptional profiling using Affymetrix gene chips revealed that the MEF salts significantly 
modified transcript levels in blood and all tissues examined (brain, inguinal lymph node (ILN), 
mesenteric lymph node (MLN), kidney, jejunum and spleen) with the most prominent response in 
the kidney (see Figure 24). DMF and MMF were also stated to be active in this system.

Pharmacokinetic properties of DMF and the MEF salts 
In  pharmacokinetic  investigations  in  rats  and  dogs,  DMF  was  rapidly  absorbed  from  the 
gastrointestinal tract and converted pre-systemically to its active metabolite MMF. Quick absorption 
was also confirmed for MEF in these species. MMF was found to be further metabolised to fumaric 
acid,  citric  acid  and  glucose  indicating  initial  DMF  metabolism  by  esterases  followed  by  the 
tricarboxylic  acid  cycle.  Accordingly,  DMF  was  found  to  be  predominantly  eliminated  as  CO2.In 
contrast, the initial metabolic pathway of  MEF appears different from DMF, but the metabolism of 
both  substances  converges  at  the  level  of  fumaric  acid,  which  is  inactive  and  then  further 
metabolised by the endogenous tricarboxylic acid cycle. 
Newly  submitted  metabolism  data  obtained  in  hepatocyte  suspensions  in vitro  also  suggest 
formation of GSH conjugates of DMF. Other in vitro data indicate that MEF forms GSH conjugates 
as  well  and  that  DMF  appears  to  be  more  reactive  towards  GSH  than  MEF.  In  hepatocytes, 
however, no MEF was found among DMF metabolites and only MMF together with a low amount of 
other minor metabolites were identified. Analyses using liver microsomes or hepatocytes from rats 
and humans further confirmed that MEF does not convert to either DMF or MMF and DMF or MMF 
are  not  transformed  into  MEF.  In  agreement  with  this  finding,  no  MEF  was  detected  in  plasma  or 
tissues of mice after oral administration of DMF, and, conversely, no DMF or MMF was identified in 
mice after oral administration of MEF. Overall, the presented data thus support that DMF and MEF 
have different pharmacokinetic properties and are not metabolites of each other in vivo. 
Conclusions on non-clinical aspects 
In  non-clinical  investigations,  DMF  and  MEF  independently  demonstrated  pharmacological  activity 
by  the  regulation  of  Nrf2-dependent  gene  expression.  The  pharmacokinetic  data  further  suggest 
that  the  initial  metabolic  pathway  is  different  for  both  substances.  In  the  first  step,  DMF  is 
metabolised to MMF, however, MMF and MEF are metabolised differently. The metabolic pathways 
appear  to  converge  at  the  level  of  fumaric  acid,  which  is  inactive  and  enters  the  endogenous 
tricarboxylic  acid  cycle.  In  addition,  non-clinical  data  have  shown  that  there  is  no  metabolic 
interconversion between MMF and MEF or conversion of MEF to DMF or MMF in liver microsomes or 
hepatocytes  from  rats  and  humans.  Both  substances,  DMF  and  MEF  show  different  levels  of 
glutathione (GSH) conjugation reactions.

2.10.3.  Clinical Aspects 
Clinical  data  on  the  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  DMF  and  the  MEF  salts 
components were presented as evidence to their pharmacological activities and different metabolic 
pathways,  with  the  aim  of  supporting  that  the  composition  of  Fumaderm  (dimethyl  fumarate  and 
MEF salts) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) are different.  
Pharmacodynamic activities of DMF, MEF salts and fumaric acid  
DMF and MMF 
DMF and its metabolite MMF have been shown to be pharmacologically active.  
MEF 
The  available  clinical  data  on  MEF  alone  were  derived  from  published  literature  and  are  limited. 
These  confirmed  the  pharmacological  activity  seen  preclinically  and  the  most  relevant  data  are 
summarised below: 
1) Nieboer et al., 1989 
The applicant presented this publication describing therapeutic regimens of psoriasis with different 
fumaric acid esters and their salts. In all trials, efficacy was evaluated by a psoriasis severity score 
at  4 week  intervals,  whereas  safety  was  assessed  based  on  haematological and  clinical  chemistry 
parameters  and  adverse  events.  However,  no  pharmacokinetic  data  were  presented.  Relevant 
investigations and main findings are provided below:

Investigations 
Main findings 
I) Oral administration of a maximum dose 
There  was  no  difference  between  the  numbers  of  improved,

unimproved, or deteriorated cases in both groups. The average

showed  a  greater  drop  in  the  MEFAE-Na  group  than  in  the 
placebo group (not further specified). 
II)  Comparative  study  of  720 mg  Na-MEF 
No difference was seen between the 720 mg versus the 240 mg 
(n = 10)  with  the  previous  240 mg  Na-
regimen with regard to the number of improved patients. 
MEF dose (n = 10) in a subsequent study 
Significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between the final 
for 3 months 
scores of scaling and itching of both groups. The average final 
scores of the total groups and the extent of the eruption, the 
redness and the thickness were not different.

mg MEF-Zn). 
Both  720 mg  Na-MEF  and  240 mg  DMF  doses  produced  mild  disturbances  of  liver  and  kidney 
function, which disappeared following drug discontinuation.

Ninety percent (90%) of patients treated with MEF salts alone experienced flushing and tingling of 
skin  (higher  than  observed  with  DMF  alone).  In  addition,  DMF  selectively  decreased  suppressor 
T lymphocytes in about 50 % of the patients.  
The  authors  stated  that  from  studies  I  to  IV  it  appeared  that  the  gastrointestinal  symptoms  were 
caused mainly by DMFAE. The enteric-coated FAE-forte tablets (containing the mono-ethylester FA) 
in study V caused less frequent and less serious stomach pain and nausea (14/36 (39%)) than the 
enteric-coated DMFAE in studies III (16/22 (73%)) and V (29/56 (52%)). However, results may be 
biased  by  differences  in  the  formulation:  DMF  was  formulated  as  enteric-coated  granulated 
capsules,  whereas  the  exact  formulation  of  Na-MEF  is  not  known  (described  as  “capsules”).  An 
early release of approximately 80% of DMF from the enteric-coated granulated capsules resulted in 
the stomach may explain a higher percentage of gastrointestinal side effects with DMF alone. The 
CHMP  also  noted  that  treatment  effects  were  seen  earlier  with  DMF/MEF  combination  than  with 
DMF alone. 
2) Nieboer et al., 1990 
In  a  later  double-blind  trial  comparing  the  effects  of  DMF  (n = 22)  single  treatment  with  the 
DMF/MEF  salt  combination  (n = 23)  for  4 months,  50 %  of  the  psoriasis  patients  in  both  study 
groups similarly revealed a considerable improvement in the psoriasis severity score. The authors 
stated that this percentage was even higher when one did not consider the initial study population, 
but  only  those  patients  who  could  be  evaluated  after  4  months.  In  that  calculation  the 
improvement  percentage  (i.e.  a  psoriasis  severity  score  more  than  halved)  was  55%  in  the  DMF 
group  and  80%  in  the  DMF/MEF  salt  combination  group.  The  course  of  the  total  score  and  of  the 
separate  parameters  during  the  4  months  of  the  study  showed  a  tendency  towards  a  more  rapid 
result with the DMF/MEF salt combination group than with the DMF single treatment.  
Fumaric acid 
According to the applicant, the inactivity of fumaric acid is uncontroverted and is confirmed by the 
European Commission Report of Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition on the Safety of Fumaric 
Acid,  adopted  January  22,  2003,  which  concludes,  “The  fumarate  esters  (…)  are  effective  in  the 
immumodulation  of  psoriatic  patients  but  not  in  healthy  volunteers.  There  is  no  evidence  fumaric 
acid shows comparable immunomodulating activity…” (See Section 4.3, Conclusion, page 11). The 
CHMP has also affirmed that fumaric acid is not active in Tecfidera noting DMF has been considered 
as the only active substance in Tecfidera and MMF is considered as the primary active metabolite of 
DMF.  
Data  on  inactivity of  fumaric  acid  were  also  derived  from  one literature  reference  suggesting that 
plasma  levels  of  fumaric  acid  remained  below  the  limit  of  detection  following  oral  intake  of 
Fumaderm (Rostami-Yazdi et al., 2010).  
Pharmacokinetic properties of DMF and the MEF salts 
MEF is well absorbed and comprises a significant active fumarate exposure following administration 
of Fumaderm.  
The  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  experiments  indicate  that  DMF  is  metabolised  to  MMF  and  that  MMF  and 
MEF  are  metabolised  differently.  In  addition,  there  is  no  metabolic  interconversion  between  MMF 
and  MEF  or  conversion  of  MEF  to  DMF  or  MMF  in  liver  microsomes  or  hepatocytes  from  rats  and 
humans.  
Also,  DMF  and  MEF  differ  in  their  degree  of  reactivity  with  nucleophiles,  as  evidenced  by  their 
different  levels  of  glutathione  (GSH)  conjugation  reactions.  In  addition  to  these  data,  a  literature 
reference  was  presented  (Rostami-Yazdi  et al.,  2010)  to  support  the  difference  in  the 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 118/126 
 
  
  
  
 
pharmacokinetic  properties  of  DMF  and  MEF.  The  plasma  levels  of  DMF,  MMF  and  MEF  were 
investigated in psoriasis patients after two doses of Fumaderm containing 120 mg DMF (MW: 144 g 
/mol) and 95 mg MEF (MW: 144 g /mol). The ratio between the AUC0-∞ of MMF and MEF is 2.1 to 
1.0 [based on Median AUC 0-∞ after dose correction]. 
Table 30: Pharmacokinetic parameters for MMF and MEF in plasma of three psoriasis 
patients after oral intake of two tablets of Fumaderm in a fasting state 
Together, these data indicate that DMF and MEF are distinct molecular entities and have unique 
activities. 
Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The  evidence  provided,  although  limited  and  based  on  literature  precluding  full  assessment, 
support the non-clinical data and suggests that both DMF and MEF have pharmacological activities, 
with  MEF  showing  activity  alone  in  psoriasis  both  from  an  efficacy  and  safety/tolerability  point  of 
view. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that DMF and MEF are distinct molecular entities. 
2.10.4.  Overall discussion and Conclusions 
The  European  Commission  (EC)  requested  the  CHMP  to  assess  if  dimethyl  fumarate  is  different 
from Fumaderm composed of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), calcium salt of ethyl fumarate, magnesium 
salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate  and  zinc  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate  (also  called  “monoethyl 
fumarate salts”) with a view to include an assessment of the new active substance (‘NAS’) status of 
DMF in Tecfidera, as per applicant request. The EC clarified that: 
i)  a  new  active  substance  under  Directive  2001/83/EC  is  a  chemical  substance  not  previously 
authorised  as  a  medicinal  product  in  the  European  Union  (Annex  I  to  the  Notice  to  applicants 
Volume  2A,  Procedures  for  marketing  authorisation,  Chapter  1,  Marketing  authorisations,  June 
2013) and, 
ii)  dimethyl  fumarate  is  part  of  the  medicinal  product  Fumaderm  authorised  in  1994  in  Germany, 
but it has not been previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union,  
For  the  decision  of  whether  dimethyl  fumarate  is  different  from  Fumaderm  composed of  dimethyl 
fumarate, calcium salt of monoethyl fumarate, magnesium salt of monoethyl fumarate and zinc salt 
of monoethyl fumarate the following provision of Article 10(2)(b) (Directive 2001/83/EC) has been 
taken into account: 
“The  different  salts,  esters,  ethers,  isomers,  mixtures  of  isomers,  complexes  or  derivatives  of  an 
active  substance  shall  be  considered  to  be  the  same  active  substance,  unless  they  differ 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy”. 
Furthermore, Part II (3) of the Annex to the Directive states: 
“Where  the  active  substance  of  an  essentially  similar  medicinal  product  contains  the  same 
therapeutic  moiety  as  the  original  authorised  product  associated  with  a  different  salt/ester 
complex/derivative  evidence  that  there  is  no  change  in  the  pharmaco-kinetics  of  the  moiety, 
EMA/800904/2013 Corr. 1 
Page 119/126 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
pharmaco-dynamics  and/or  in  toxicity  which  could  change  the  safety/  efficacy  profile  shall  be 
demonstrated.  Should  this  not  be  the  case,  this  association  shall  be  considered  as  a  new  active 
substance.” 
In this context, the CHMP considered whether MEF and DMF are different active substances. The 
following points were considered in reaching this decision: 
a) MEF and DMF are different esters of fumaric acid 
From the CHMP’s point of view, it is evident that DMF and the MEF salts contain the same backbone 
structure of fumaric acid (FA). They are also clearly different esters of fumaric acid (FA).  
b) Fumaric acid is not an active substance and therefore it follows that it is the esters 
themselves that give the activity in both MEF and DMF.  
DMF  and  its  metabolite  MMF  have  been  shown  to  be  pharmacologically  active.  It  has  also  been 
established that fumaric acid is not a therapeutic moiety of DMF and is pharmacologically inactive. 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  non-clinical  data  including  Nrf2-dependent  gene  expression  together  with 
published  clinical  data  suggesting  the  pharmacological  activity  of  MEF  in  psoriasis  lead  to  the 
conclusion that DMF and MEF are both active. 
c) The esters are different pharmaceutically (physicochemical properties) and do not 
inter-convert or follow the same metabolic path in-vivo. 
The  applicant  provided  data  on  DMF  and  MEF  with  regard  to  key  chemical  differences,  distinct 
physical properties (melting point, molecular weight, aqueous solubility), spectroscopic differences 
in solution, structural relationship, and their chemical reactivity. Although this data on its own does 
not  constitute  an  argument  as  to  why  the  compounds  should  be  considered  different  active 
substances, the impact of these properties on the different behaviour of MEF salts and DMF in the 
body supports the conclusion that DMF and MEF are different pharmaceutically. 
The  pharmacokinetic  data  further  suggest  that  the  initial  metabolic  pathway  is  different  for  both 
substances.  The  metabolic  pathways  appear  to  converge  at  the  level  of  fumaric  acid,  which  is 
inactive  and  enters  the  endogenous  tricarboxylic  acid  cycle.  In  addition,  there  is  no  metabolic 
interconversion between MMF and MEF or conversion of MEF to DMF or MMF in liver microsomes or 
hepatocytes  from  rats  and  humans.  Both  substances,  DMF  and  MEF,  show  different  levels  of 
glutathione (GSH) conjugation reactions.  
Taking  into  consideration  the  above,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  MEF  and  DMF  are  both  active  and 
are not the same active substance since they do not share the same therapeutic moiety (cf part II 
(3) of the Annex to Directive 2001/83/EC as amended).Therefore, the CHMP considered that there 
was  no  need  to  further  investigate  potential  significant  differences  with  regards  to  safety  and/or 
efficacy properties.  
Based  on  the  review  of  data  on  the  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  properties  of  both  DMF  and 
MEF,  the  CHMP  considered  that,  the  active  substance  of  Tecfidera,  dimethyl  fumarate,  is  not  the 
same as Fumaderm as MEF and DMF are considered pharmacologically active agents which contain 
different therapeutic moieties.  
Based  on  the  review  of  the  scientific  evidence,  and  in  line  with  clarification  provided  by  the 
European  Commission  above,  it  follows  that  dimethyl  fumarate  is  different  from  Fumaderm 
composed of dimethyl fumarate, calcium salt of ethyl fumarate, magnesium salt of ethyl hydrogen 
fumarate  and  zinc  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate.  Therefore,  the  active  substance  of  Tecfidera, 
dimethyl fumarate, is a new active substance.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
DMF  (dimethyl  fumarate)  is  a  novel  orally  administered  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients 
suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Beta-interferons require long-term parenteral 
injections  and  are  considered  to  have  a  modest  efficacy  as  compared  to  second  line  second-line 
disease  modifying  therapies  (DMTs).    However,  these  second-line  DMTs  carry  greater  risks 
including major morbidity and mortality (e.g. PML). BG00012 is claimed to fulfil an unmet medical 
need  for  an  oral  agent  that  is  at  least  as  effective  as  the  currently  available  first-line  treatments 
but without the serious undesirable effects of the available second-line DMTs. 
The exact mechanism of action of DMF is unknown but it is thought to be mediated principally via 
activation  of  the  nuclear  factor  (erythroid-derived  2)-related  factor  2  (Nrf2)  antioxidant  response 
pathway.  Additional  effects  for  the  regulation  of  the  immune  system  such  as  anti-inflammatory 
actions  have  been  shown  in  pre-clinical  studies,  although  this  was  not  clearly  observed  in  the 
clinical setting. 
Two  large  phase  3  pivotal  studies  (109MS301,  109MS302)  over  two  years  were  conducted.  The 
relative  risk  of  relapse  at  2  years  by  BG00012  BID  and  TID  was  reduced  over  placebo  by  49% 
(hazard  ratio  of  0.51)  and  50%  (hazard  ratio  of  0.50),  respectively,  in  study  109MS301,  and  by 
34%  (hazard  ratio  of  0.66)  and  45%  (hazard  ratio  of  0.55)  in  study  109MS302.  The  reduction  in 
annualized relapse rate over placebo with BG00012 BID and TID was 53% (ratio rate of 0.47) and 
48% (ratio rate of 0.52), respectively, in study 109MS301 and was 44% (ratio rate of 0.560) and 
50.5 % (ratio rate of 0.495) in study 109MS302. 
Patients defined as having at least one relapse while on ≥12 months therapy with beta-interferon, 
and having at least 9 T2- hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion or 
having  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate were  representing  around  20 %  of  the  population 
treated with BG00012 BID.  Around 6% of BG00012 BID population also had 2 or more relapses in 
the year prior to enrolment and at least one Gd enhancing lesions. In these populations considered 
relevant for the definition of “high disease activity”, a consistent effect on relapses was shown. 
Disability  progression  was  measured  in  terms  of  time  to  a  12-week  confirmed  increase  in  EDSS 
score. In study 109MS301, both DMF tested doses reached statistical significance when compared 
to  placebo  in  reducing  the  risk  of  12-week  sustained  disability  progression  (240  mg  BID: 
p=0.0050, 240 mg TID: p=0.0128). The hazard ratios were 0.62 and 0.66 for 240 mg BID and 240 
mg TID groups, respectively. 
From  study  109MS302,  a  post-hoc  analysis  was  provided  of  the treatment  effects  in  BG00012  as 
compared  to  GA.  In  the  majority  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints,  including  the  ARR  and 
time to 3-month sustained disability), an effect in favour of BG00012 was observed. However, both 
DMF tested doses failed to reach statistical significance when compared to placebo in reducing the 
risk of 12-week sustained disability progression (240 mg BID: p=0.2536; 240 mg TID: p=0.2041). 
The hazard ratios were 0.79 and 0.76 for 240 mg BID and 240 mg TID groups, respectively. 
Based on historical comparisons, there was a relative reduction for ARR of 44-53% under BG00012 
compared to a relative reduction in ARR of around 30% for interferons and GA, suggesting at least 
comparable  efficacy  on  relapses  for  BG00012  when  compared  to  approved  first-line  treatment. 
However, the current second-line treatments provided even better results on this endpoint.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A limited number of patients with high disease activity was included in the clinical studies. Most of 
the patients in all treatment groups experienced no relapses (109MS301: placebo: 58%, BG00012 
240 mg BID: 76%, BG00012 240 mg TID: 77%; 109MS302: placebo: 61%, BG00012 240 mg BID: 
74%, BG00012 240 mg TID: 78%, GA: 70%).  Most of the patients had no Gd enhancing lesions at 
baseline, suggesting that patients in general were rather mild affected. 
Although  the  efficacy  on  relapse  was  consistently  shown  across  the  studied  population  (including 
those  subgroups  defined  as  “high  disease  activity”),  a  lesser  effect  of  BG00012  on  relapses  in 
patients  with  higher  EDSS  score  at  baseline,  in  non-naïve  patients  and  in  patients  aged  40  years 
and above was observed in both pivotal studies.  
Effect  on  disability  progression  was  not  that  robust  across  the  two  pivotal  studies.  Statistical 
significance was reached for the first pivotal study, but not in study 109MS302. In both individual 
studies, a sensitivity analysis was performed in terms of 24-weeks sustained disability progression. 
Although, none of the BG00012 treatment arms reached statistical significance when compared to 
placebo,  a  similar  trend  as  for  12  weeks  confirmed  disability  progression  was  however  noted.    In 
the subgroups defined as “high disease activity”, the effect for sustained disability on the endpoint 
time to 3-month sustained disability progression was not clearly established. 
Efficacy  data  in  patients  who  discontinued  study  drug  were  considered  limited  to  evaluate  a 
possible rebound effect. Additional Long term data are awaited to further investigate this issue as 
well as to confirm maintenance of the effect. 
Conclusions on added clinical benefit versus existing available therapy could not be confirmed due 
to the design of the pivotal studies. Study 109MS301 did not include an active comparator. Study 
109MS302  included  glatiramer  acetate  but  was  not  designed  for  a  direct  comparison  with  DMF. 
Historical  comparisons  were  considered  only  as  supportive  of  the  efficacy  in  the  intended  MS 
population. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Flushing,  GI  events,  decreases  in  WBC  and  lymphocytes  counts  and  proteinuria  have  been 
considered as important identified risks.  
Flushing  and  related  symptoms  (hot  flush,  erythema,  generalized  erythema,  burning  sensation, 
skin burning,  feeling hot and hyperaemia) were reported with an overall 5-times higher incidence 
in  BG00012  BID/TID-treated  subjects  compared  to  placebo  and  GA.    The  overall  prevalence  for 
flushing  was  31%  during  the  first  month,  dropping  to  about  24%  in  the  second  month,  and  only 
slightly  if  at  all  less  in  subsequent  months.  The  incidence  of  flushing  (including  hot  flush)  and 
related symptoms was highest during the first 3 months of the studies, with a peak in Month 1 (6% 
placebo  vs.  36%  BG00012  BID,  35%  BG00012  TID).  In  three  of  the  serious  flushing  events 
patients required hospital treatment including parenteral steroids. 
GI  disorders  (diarrhoea,  nausea,  upper  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  dyspepsia, 
gastroenteritis,  GI  disorder)  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  BG00012-treated  subjects 
compared to placebo and GA and occurred with a higher incidence during the first three months of 
BG00012 treatment. The overall prevalence in BG00012 BID and TID-treated subjects was 22 and 
25%  in  the  first  month,  17  and  16%  during  the  second  month,  and  6-12%  and  8-12%  in 
subsequent months. 
WBC counts and lymphocytes decreased from Week 4 to Week 48 in BG00012-treated subjects and 
with  a  plateau  through  Week  96.  Mean  decrease  for  the  first  year  was  11%  and  30%  for  WBC 
counts  and  lymphocyte  counts.  No  corresponding  serious  infection  was  reported  for  clinically

significant  low  lymphocyte  counts.  However,  potentially  clinically  significant  WBC  counts  <3.0  x 
109/L were higher in the BG00012 groups compared to placebo and GA (1% placebo, 7% BG00012 
BID,  5%  BG00012  TID,  2%  GA).  For  lymphocytes,  more  subjects  in  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID 
groups  (28%  and  21%,  respectively)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (3%)  had  a  potentially  clinically 
significant  abnormal  value  <0.8  ×  109/L;  6%  and  3%  of  subjects  in  the  BG00012  BID  and  TID 
groups, respectively and <1% in the placebo group had lymphocyte counts <0.5 × 109/L.  
Renal and urinary adverse events were slightly increased with BG00012 treatment: 18% placebo, 
19%  BG00012  BID,  22%  BG00012  TID,  17%  GA).  The  most  common  AE  in  this  SOC  was 
proteinuria: placebo 7%, BG00012 BID 9%, BG00012 TID 10%, GA 9%.  In addition, an increased 
incidence for renal and urinary AEs was noted in patients receiving nephrotoxic medications (PNM). 
The incidence of hepatic adverse events was similar in placebo and BG00012-treated patients (9% 
placebo  vs.  9%  BG00012  BID,  10%  BG00012  TID,  and  11%  GA).  However,  elevations  of  liver 
transaminases were most often reported and of slightly higher incidence compared to placebo: ALT 
increased  (5%  placebo  vs.  6%  BG00012  BID  and  TID  and  GA  each),  AST  increased  (2%  placebo 
vs. 4% BG00012 BID and TID and GA each). Increased hepatic enzymes were detected especially 
within the first 6 months of treatment. Most BG00012-treated subjects  had post-baseline values of 
ALT and AST   <3 x ULN. Although the safety profile did not reveal a detrimental effect of BG00012 
on these AEs, animal data showed renal and liver toxicities associated with BG00012.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Flushing  events  may  be  prostaglandin  mediated,  however  the  mechanism  has  not  been  fully 
elucidated. The underlying mechanism for GI events is considered unknown. Given the importance 
of  these  events  in  the  safety  profile  of  DMF,  additional  data  from  the  ongoing  study  evaluating 
effects  of  aspirin  or  dose  titration  on  flushing  and  gastrointestinal  events  following  oral 
administration  of  BG00012  are  awaited  and  further  investigations  may  need  to  be  considered  on 
the basis of these expected data. 
Data  are  also  lacking  on  the  effect  of  BG00012  on  immune  response.  A  specific  clinical  study  to 
investigate this effect in relation to vaccination, lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulin levels in 
RRMS patients, has been included as part of the Risk Management Plan.  
Malignancies  reported  in  the  BG00012  groups  were  low  and  similar  to  placebo  and  GA. 
Nevertheless, eight additional malignancies were reported in the ongoing study 109MS303. Further 
long  term  data,  included  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan,  are  expected  to  investigate  this  potential 
risk.  
In MS studies, females of child bearing potential were required to practice effective contraception. 
Nonetheless,  there  have  been  56  pregnancies  in  the  BG00012  clinical  development  program,  of 
which 38 pregnancies were reported in subjects exposed to BG00012 (37 subjects with MS and 1 
healthy volunteer) as of 02 January 2013. A Pregnancy Exposure Registry has been put in place to 
monitor  the  use  in  this  special  population.  In  addition,  the  potential  risk  of  interaction  with  oral 
contraceptives will be further investigated via a specific in vivo study. 
Four PML cases were reported on products containing DMF. Severe lymphopenia was detected in all 
of  these  patients.  Because  the  DMF  mechanism  on  MS  is  not  completely  understood,  PML  is 
considered as a potential risk. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

DMF  (dimethyl  fumarate)  is  a  novel  orally  administered  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients 
suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The exact mechanism of action of the DMF is 
unknown but it is thought to be mediated principally via activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-
derived  2)-related  factor  2  (Nrf2)  antioxidant  response  pathway;  this  new  mechanism  of  action 
appeared  to  offer  a  relatively  favourable  safety  profile,  although  further  long  term  data  are 
expected to monitor the potential and identified risks. The main risks for DMF included flushing, GI 
events,  decreases  in  WBC  and  lymphocytes  counts,  proteinuria,  and  increases  in  liver 
transaminases  and  these  were  considered  manageable  with  the  proposed  risk  minimisation 
measures.  Whilst  the  studied  patient  population  generally  presented  a  rather  low  disease  activity 
across the studies, Tecfidera demonstrated a consistent effect on relapses compared to placebo to 
a  statistically  significant  degree  and  this  was  also  evident  in  a  sufficiently  represented  group  of 
patients with “high disease activity”.  The effect on disability progression was not that robust given 
the results between studies on the various endpoints for time to confirmed disability progression.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Having considered that the efficacy was sufficiently demonstrated across the RRMS population and 
that the identified risks were manageable with the proposed risk minimisation measures, the CHMP 
concluded that the benefit-risk balance for Tecfidera was positive for the following indication: 
“Tecfidera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
(please  refer  to  section 5.1  for  important  information  on  the  populations  for  which  efficacy  has 
been established)”. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Tecfidera  in  the  treatment  of  “adult  patients  with 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis” is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

New Active Substance Status 
The  CHMP  considers  that  dimethyl  fumarate  is  different  from  Fumaderm  composed  of  dimethyl 
fumarate,  calcium  salt  of  ethyl  fumarate,  magnesium  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate  and  zinc 
salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate.  Based  on  the  review  of  the  scientific  evidence,  and  in  line  with 
clarification provided by the European Commission that: 
i)  a  new  active  substance  under  Directive  2001/83/EC  is  a  chemical  substance  not  previously 
authorised  as  a  medicinal  product  in  the  European  Union  (Annex  I  to  the  Notice  to  applicants 
Volume  2A,  Procedures  for  marketing  authorisation,  Chapter  1,  Marketing  authorisations,  June 
2013) and, 
ii)  dimethyl  fumarate  is  part  of  the  medicinal  product  Fumaderm  authorised  in  1994  in  Germany, 
but it has not been previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union,  
the active substance of Tecfidera, dimethyl fumarate, is a new active substance.2 
2 Post-opinion note: The NAS status at the time of the CHMP opinion was to be considered in the 
regulatory  context  provided  by  the  Commission.  Following  further  discussion  of  the  regulatory 
context at the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, on 30 January 2014 the 
European  Commission  adopted,  in  accordance  with  the  opinion  of  the  Standing  Committee,  a 
decision  granting  a  marketing  authorisation  for  Tecfidera  including  the  following  recital:  dimethyl 
fumarate  (DMF),  the  active  substance  of  "Tecfidera  -  Dimethyl  fumarate",  is  part  of  the 
composition of the authorised medicinal product Fumaderm which consist of DMF and calcium salt 
of  ethyl  fumarate,  magnesium  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate  and  zinc  salt  of  ethyl  hydrogen 
fumarate  (MEF  salts),  belonging  to  the  same  marketing  authorisation  holder.  The  Committee  for 
Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  concluded  that  MEF  and  DMF  are  both  active  and  are  not  the 
same  active  substance  since  they  do  not  share  the  same  therapeutic  moiety.  Therefore  it  is 
considered that Tecfidera containing DMF is different from Fumaderm the other already authorised 
medicinal product composed of DMF and MEF salts. Therefore "Tecfidera - Dimethyl fumarate", the 
application of which was based on Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, and the already authorised 
medicinal  product  Fumaderm  do  not  belong  to  the  same  global  marketing  authorisation  as 
described in Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
In  view  of  this  evolution  of  the  regulatory  considerations,  as  reflected  in  the  recital  of  the 
Commission  Decision,  the  final  statement  in  the  CHMP  opinion  that  “the  active  substance  of 
Tecfidera,  dimethyl  fumarate,  is  a  new  active  substance”  is  obsolete.   However,  all  the  other 
scientific considerations and conclusions related to this assessment remain valid.

-
-
-
Pre-existing endometrial hyperplasia and severe hepatic failure are contra-indications in long-
term use of toremifene.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Both in preclinical investigations and in humans, changes in cardiac electrophysiology have 
been observed following exposure to toremifene, in the form of QT prolongation. For reasons 
of drug safety, toremifene is therefore contraindicated in patients with:
Congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation

Previous history of symptomatic arrhythmias.
Toremifene should not be used concurrently with other drugs that prolong the QT interval (see also 
section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Gynaecological examination should be performed before treatment administration, closely looking at
pre-existing endometrial abnormality. Afterwards gynaecological examination should be repeated at
least once a year. Patients with additional risk of endometrial cancer, e.g. patients suffering from
hypertension or diabetes, having high BMI (> 30) or history of hormone replacement therapy should 
be closely monitored (see also section 4.8).
Anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported. Red blood cell, leukocyte or platelet 
counts should be monitored when using Fareston.
Cases of liver injury, including elevation of liver enzymes (> 10 times upper limit of normal), 
hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with toremifene. Most of them occurred during the first 
months of treatment. The pattern of the liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.
Patients with a history of severe thromboembolic disease should generally not be treated with 
toremifene (see also section 4.8).
Fareston has been shown to prolong the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram in some patients in a 
dose-related manner. The following information regarding QT-prolongation is of special importance 
(for contraindications see section 4.3).
A QT clinical study with a 5-arm parallel design (placebo, moxifloxacin 400 mg, toremifene 20 mg, 
80 mg, and 300 mg) has been performed in 250 male patients to characterize the effects of toremifene 
on the QTc interval duration. The results of this study show a clear positive effect of toremifene in the 
80 mg group with mean prolongations of 21 - 26 ms. Regarding the 20 mg group, this effect is 
significant as well, according to ICH guidelines, with upper confidence interval of 10 - 12 ms. These 
results strongly suggest an important dose-dependent effect. As women tend to have a longer baseline 
QTc interval compared with men, they may be more sensitive to QTc-prolonging medications. Elderly 
patients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.
Fareston should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions (especially 
elderly patients) such as acute myocardial ischaemia or QT prolongation as this may lead to an 
increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias (incl. Torsade de pointes) and cardiac arrest (see also 
section 4.3).
If signs or symptoms that may be associated with cardiac arrhythmia occur during treatment with 
Fareston, treatment should be stopped and an ECG should be performed.
If the QTc interval is > 500 ms, Fareston should not be used.
Patients with non-compensated cardiac insufficiency or severe angina pectoris should be closely
monitored.
Hypercalcemia may occur at the beginning of toremifene treatment in patients with bone metastasis 
and thus these patients should be closely monitored.
There are no systematic data available from patients with labile diabetes, from patients with severely
altered performance status or from patients with cardiac failure.

Excipients
Fareston tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
An additive effect on QT interval prolongation between Fareston and the following drugs and other 
medicinal products that may prolong the QTc interval cannot be excluded. This might lead to an 
increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de pointes. Therefore co-administration 
of Fareston with any of the following medicinal products is contraindicated (see also section 4.3):
-
-
-
-
antiarrhythmics class IA (e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide) or
antiarrhythmics class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide),
neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, pimozide, sertindole, haloperidol, sultopride), 
certain antimicrobials agents (moxifloxacin, erythromycin IV, pentamidine, antimalarials 
particularly halofantrine),
certain antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine),
others (cisapride, vincamine IV, bepridil, diphemanil).
-
-
Drugs which decrease renal calcium excretion, e.g. thiazide diuretics, may increase the risk of
hypercalcaemia.
Enzyme inducers, like phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, may increase the rate of 
toremifene metabolism thus lowering the steady-state concentration in serum. In such cases doubling 
of the daily dose may be necessary.
There is a known interaction between anti-estrogens and warfarin-type anticoagulants leading to a
seriously increased bleeding time. Therefore, the concomitant use of toremifene with such drugs 
should be avoided.
Theoretically the metabolism of toremifene is inhibited by drugs known to inhibit the CYP3A enzyme
system which is reported to be responsible for its main metabolic pathways. Examples of such drugs 
are antifungal imidazoles (ketoconazole); other antifungal agents (itraconazole, voriconazole, 
posaconazole); protease inhibitors (ritonavir, nelfinavir), macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin, 
telithromycine). Concomitant use of those drugs with toremifene should be carefully considered.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of Fareston in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Fareston should not be used during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
In rats, decreased body weight gain of the offspring during lactation was observed.
Fareston should not be used during lactation.
Fertility
Toremifene is recommended for postmenopausal patients.

Thromboembolic events include deep venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism 
(see also section 4.4).
Toremifene treatment has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels (increases of 
transaminases) and in very rare occasions with more severe liver function abnormalities (jaundice).
A few cases of hypercalcaemia have been reported in patients with bone metastases at the beginning 
of toremifene treatment.
Endometrial hypertrophy may develop during the treatment due to the partial estrogenic effect of 
toremifene. There is a risk of increased endometrial changes including hyperplasia, polyps and cancer. 
This may be due to the underlying mechanism/estrogenic stimulation (see also section 4.4).
Fareston increases the QT interval in a dose-related manner (see also section 4.4).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Vertigo, headache and dizziness were observed in healthy volunteer studies at daily dose of 680 mg. 
The dose-related QTc interval prolongation potential of Fareston should also be taken into account in 
cases of overdose. There is no specific antidote and the treatment is symptomatic.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, Anti-estrogens, ATC code: L02BA02
Toremifene is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative. As other members of this class, e.g. 
tamoxifen and clomifene, toremifene binds to estrogen receptors and may produce estrogenic, anti-
estrogenic or both effects, depending upon the duration of treatment, animal species, gender, target 
organ and variable selected. In general, however, nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivatives are 
predominantly anti-estrogenic in rats and man and estrogenic in mice.
In post-menopausal breast cancer patients, toremifene treatment is associated with modest reductions 
in both total serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL).
Toremifene binds specifically to estrogen receptors, competitively with oestradiol, and inhibits 
estrogen-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell replication. In some experimental cancers 
and/or using high-dose, toremifene displays anti-tumour effects which are not estrogen-dependent.

The anti-tumour effect of toremifene in breast cancer is mainly due to the anti-estrogenic effect, 
although other mechanisms (changes in oncogene expression, growth factor secretion, induction of 
apoptosis and influence on cell cycle kinetics) may also be involved in the anti-tumour effect.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Toremifene is readily absorbed after oral administration. Peak concentrations in serum are obtained 
within 3 (range 2 - 5) hours. Food intake has no effect on the extent of absorption but may delay the 
peak concentrations by 1.5 - 2 hours. The changes due to food intake are not clinically significant.
Distribution
The serum concentration curve can be described by a biexponential equation. The half-life of the first 
(distribution) phase is 4 (range 2 - 12) hours, and of the second (elimination) phase 5 (range 2 -
10) days. The basal disposition parameters (CL and V) could not be estimated due to the lack of 
intravenous study. Toremifene binds extensively (> 99.5%) to serum proteins, mainly to albumin. 
Toremifene obeys linear serum kinetics at oral daily doses between 11 and 680 mg. The mean 
concentration of toremifene at steady-state is 0.9 (range 0.6 - 1.3) µg/ml at the recommended dose of 
60 mg per day.
Biotransformation
Toremifene is extensively metabolised. In human serum the main metabolite is N-demethyltoremifene 
with mean half-life of 11 (range 4 - 20) days. Its steady-state concentrations are about twice compared 
to those of the parent compound. It has similar anti-estrogenic, albeit weaker anti-tumour activity than 
the parent compound.
It is bound to plasma proteins even more extensively than toremifene, the protein bound fraction being 
> 99.9%. Three minor metabolites have been detected in human serum: (deaminohydroxy)toremifene, 
4-hydroxytoremifene, and N,N-didemethyltoremifene. Although they have theoretically interesting 
hormonal effects, their concentrations during toremifene treatment are too low to have any major 
biological importance.
Elimination
Toremifene is eliminated mainly as metabolites to the faeces. Enterohepatic circulation can be 
expected. About 10% of the administered dose is eliminated via urine as metabolites. Owing to the 
slow elimination, steady-state concentrations in serum are reached in 4 to 6 weeks.
Characteristics in patients
Clinical anti-tumour efficacy and serum concentrations have no positive correlation at the 
recommended daily dose of 60 mg.
No information is available concerning polymorphic metabolism. Enzyme complex, known to be 
responsible for the metabolism of toremifene in humans, is cytochrome P450-dependent hepatic 
mixed function oxidase. The main metabolic pathway, N-demethylation, is mediated mainly by 
CYP3A.
Pharmacokinetics of toremifene were investigated in an open study with four parallel groups of ten 
subjects: normal subjects, patients with impaired (mean AST 57 U/L - mean ALT 76 U/L - mean 
gamma GT 329 U/L) or activated liver function (mean AST 25 U/L - mean ALT 30 U/L - mean 
gamma GT 91 U/L - patients treated with antiepileptics) and patients with impaired renal function 
(creatinine: 176 µmol/L). In this study the kinetics of toremifene in patients with impaired renal 
function were not significantly altered as compared to normal subjects. The elimination of toremifene 
and its metabolites was significantly increased in patients with activated liver function and decreased 
in patients with impaired liver function.

The acute toxicity of toremifene is low with LD-50 in rats and mice of more than 2000 mg/kg. In 
repeated toxicity studies the cause of death in rats is gastric dilatation. In the acute and chronic 
toxicity studies most of the findings are related to the hormonal effects of toremifene. The other 
findings are not toxicologically significant. Toremifene has not shown any genotoxicity and has not
been found to be carcinogenic in rats. In mice, estrogens induce ovarian and testicular tumours as well 
as hyperostosis and osteosarcomas. Toremifene has a species-specific estrogen-like effect in mice and 
causes similar tumours. These findings are postulated to be of little relevance for the safety in man, 
where toremifene acts mainly as an anti-estrogen.
Non clinical in vitro and in vivo studies have evidenced the potential of toremifene and its metabolite 
to prolong cardiac repolarisation and this can be attributed to the blockade of hERG channels.
In vivo, high plasma concentrations in monkeys caused a 24% prolongation in QTc, which is in line 
with QTc findings in humans.
It is also to be noted that the Cmax observed in the monkeys (1800 ng/ml) is two-fold compared to the 
mean Cmax observed in humans at a daily dose of 60 mg.
Action potential studies in isolated rabbit heart have shown that toremifene induce cardiac 
electrophysiological changes which start to develop at concentrations approximately 10 fold 
compared to the calculated free therapeutic plasma concentration in human.

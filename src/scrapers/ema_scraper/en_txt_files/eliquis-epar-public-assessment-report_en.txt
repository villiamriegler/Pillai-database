2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product comprises as active substance apixaban: a novel, orally active, selective, direct, reversible 
inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa).  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  INN  name  of  the  active  substance  is  apixaban  and  it  chemical  name  is  1-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-7-
oxo-6-[4-(2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)phenyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1Hpyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxamide. 
The molecular formula of the active substance is C25H25N5O4, its relative molecular mass 459.50 and its 
structural formula is shown below. 
Apixaban  appears  as  a  white  to  pale  yellow,  non  hygroscopic  crystalline  powder,  with  an  aqueous 
solubility of 0.028 mg/ml at 24°C. Apixaban is a non-ionizable compound and its partition coefficient 
at 24°C is 44.7 (log Po/w = 1.65) at pH 7.4 (n-Octanol / aqueous buffer). The molecule has no 
chiral centres, therefore, no stereoisomers exist.  
It  shows  polymorphism  and  a  number  of  hydrates  and  solvates  were  identified.  However,  only  one 
form is consistently produced by the proposed synthetic process.  
Manufacture 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  synthesis  of  apixaban    involves  a  sequence  of  five 
reactions with two isolated intermediates. 
The  quality  by  design  (QbD)  concept  has  been  used  during  the  development  of  the  manufacturing 
process for Apixaban drug substance. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug substance were 
identified on the basis of their potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the drug product and thus 
to the patient.  
Based  on  risk  assessment  and  development  work,  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  were  identified 
for some of the process steps.  Multivariate experimental design and mechanistic models were used to 
understand  the  effect  of  process  parameters  on  those  steps.  The  outcome  of  these  studies  is  the 
proposed  CPPs  and  proven  acceptable  ranges  (PARs).  The  validity  of  the  design  space  at  commercial 
scale is supported by data from batches manufactured at pilot scale 
In-process  controls  for  those  steps  where  no  critical  process  parameters  were  identified  are  applied 
and they are considered sufficient for their adequate control. 
Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  colour  (visual),  identification 
(Raman/IR,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  heavy  metals  (ICP-MS) 
and particle size (laser light scattering). 
The control strategy in relation to potential genotoxic impurities was developed from a detailed process 
understanding  of  the  fate  of  these  impurities  in  the  downstream  process  and  a  combination  of  data 
from  historical  batches  and  spiking  and  purging  experiments  to  understand  the  process  clearance 
capability of the impurities. 
Page 8/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All genotoxic materials are tested upstream and the proposed limits are sufficient to ensure that none 
of  them  is  over  the  proposed  limit  in  the  final  active  substance.  For  those  not  tested,  adequate 
supporting  data  have  been  provided.  Batch  data  and  results  of  experiments  confirmed  that  the 
genotoxic impurities from the early process steps are not carried through to the drug substance. This 
has been confirmed on 14 batches of apixaban active substance. It was further confirmed there are no 
new  genotoxic  impurities  introduced  or  formed  at  the  final  step  of  the  manufacture  of  the  active 
substance  and  therefore  testing  of  the  genotoxic  impurities  in  the  final  active  substance  is  not 
considered necessary in light of the supporting data provided. 
In relation to the genotoxic related substances of the genotoxic impurities, these follow the same fate 
in  the  downstream  process  as  their  respective  parent  compound  and  therefore,  their  contribution  to 
the total concentration is practically negligible based on the ratio of input amounts (parent compound 
versus related substance) and residual levels observed for each of the parent compound.   
An overview of all batches used in clinical and toxicological studies, is provided. Batch analysis results 
were  presented  for  eight  commercial  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  commercial  process  all 
meeting the set requirements. The batch data provided is considered sufficient in support of the control 
of the active substance. 
Stability 
long-term 
(5°C,  25°C/60%RH), 
Stability studies have been performed on three batches in line with ICH Guidelines under the following 
(30°C/65%RH)  and  accelerated 
conditions 
(40°C/75%RH).  Stability  data  have  been  provided  for  36  months  under  long-term  conditions  and  for 
six months under accelerated conditions 
In  addition  results  from  studies  under  stress  conditions  (-20°C,  50°C,  40°C/75%RH  open)  for  three 
batches and for photo-stability for one batch were also provided. 
There were no changes from initial values observed in the tested parameters at any condition. Based 
on the provided data the proposed re-test period and storage condition are justified.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
It is remarked that the formulation and manufacturing process for the apixaban tablets were designed 
to  produce  tablets  with  rapid  disintegration  and  dissolution  characteristics  ensuring  consistent  and 
acceptable bioavailability.  
Apixaban is non-ionisable, and therefore, its aqueous solubility is not affected by changes in pH. It is 
highly soluble for doses up to 10 mg and is a low permeable compound since the fraction of oral dose 
absorbed is < 90%. Thus, as per the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), it is classified as 
a Class III (high solubility/low permeability) compound. 
Information on different strengths that were used in the early stages of the clinical development was 
presented.  However,  only  the  2.5  mg  and  5  mg  were  selected  for  Phase  3  studies  and 
commercialisation.  Only  the  2.5  mg  tablet  will  be  commercialised  for  the  prevention  of  venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) which is the object of this application. Therefore, only the data related to the 
2.5  mg  strength  is  assessed  on  this  assessment  report.  It  is  noted however,  that  both  2.5  and  5 mg 
tablets are manufactured from a common granulate. 
Development  work  included  the  evaluation  of  the  different  types  of  granulation  and  the  use  of  a  film 
coat  for  the  tablets.  It  was  found  that  tablets  made  using  the  dry  granulation  process  have  more 
consistent dissolution rates. Based on a relative bioavailability study results, the minimum dissolution 
requirement  for  apixaban  was  established.  The  film  coat  of  the  tablet  is  non-functional  and  has  no 
impact  on  drug  product  performance.  It  has  been  optimised  during  development  with  regard  to  the 
aesthetic aspect. 
The  actual  changes  between  the  Phase  3  and  commercial  tablets  formulations  are  minor  and 
comparative batch data including dissolution has been presented showing no significant differences in 
the results obtained. 
The particle size of the drug substance was identified as a critical factor based on its influence on the 
dissolution  of  the  tablets.  A  study  was  conducted  to  establish  the  drug  substance  particle  size 
requirement that would produce the required in-vitro drug release and appropriate limit has been set. 
A  drug-excipient  compatibility  study  was  conducted  to  screen  potential  excipients  to  be  used  in 
formulation development. No incompatibilities with any excipient tested were observed. 
These excipients are conventional and the amounts per tablet are within their typical levels of usage in 
solid dosage forms. The tablet excipients are of compendial grades. The individual components of the 
film-coating are of compendial grades too. 
Page 9/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
The development of the dissolution method is adequately described and the discriminative ability of the 
dissolution method has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
To  establish  the  design  space  and  control  strategy  for  the  commercial  manufacture,  relationships 
between the input attributes and process parameters and the output attributes for each unit operation 
were  evaluated.  A  study  was  conducted to determine  the  steps  that  would be  required to  ensure  the 
production  of  a  uniform  blend.  Process  development  studies  for  the  remaining  unit  operations  were 
also conducted for the development of a robust commercial manufacturing process for apixaban tablets. 
No additional process development was conducted for the film-coating process step as typical coating 
procedures are followed. 
It  was  recognized that because  of the targeted  low  dose for  apixaban,  content  uniformity  of  the  final 
product  becomes  an  important  product  attribute  Since  the  drug  substance  is  mixed  with  most  of  the 
excipients at the 1st blending step (preblending), a quantitative on-line NIR method was developed to 
monitor the mixing profile during the preblending unit operation, including the acceptance criteria for 
determining  the  blending  endpoint.  The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  uses  process 
analytical  technology  (PAT),  as  well  as  conventional  analytical  tests,  to  control  the  in-process 
intermediates. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose  used  in  the  manufacture  of  tablets  is  of  animal  origin  (bovine  milk).  Statements  from  the 
suppliers attesting and finished product manufacturer in relation to the quality of lactose are provided. 
It  is  confirmed  that  all  lactose  used  complies  with  EMEA/410/41/00/01  Rev.2  “Note  for  Guidance  on 
Minimising Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products”. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  comprises  the  following  main  steps:  blending,  granulation,  blending, 
tabletting, film-coating and packaging. 
The prospective process validation for Eliquis film coated tablets will be successfully completed prior to 
launch of the commercial product. The validation batches will be processed  according to an approved 
manufacturing batch record and as per an approved Process Validation Protocol. During the validation 
study, process steps will be monitored and the results will be covered in a Process Validation Report. 
All  validation  sample  testing,  including  all  release  testing,  must  meet  predetermined  acceptance 
criteria which will be based on the approved specification for release testing. 
Due to the initially proposed use of NIR (as PAT) and RTR for the manufacturing of the drug product, 
the  proposed  finished  product  manufacturing  site  has  been  inspected  in  relation  to  this  application 
during  the  clock-stop  period.  Responses  to  observations  have  been  received  and  found  to  be  mostly 
adequate. An Inspection Report in relation to this product specific inspection has been produced. 
Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications of the solvent include tests and limits for appearance (visual), 
identification  (Raman,  IR,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units/  content  uniformity  (Ph 
Eur), disintegration (Ph Eur), impurities/degradants (HPLC - stability only), dissolution (HPLC- stability 
only) and Microbial Limit Test (Ph Eur – not routinely).  
The  elimination  of  dissolution  testing  for  apixaban  drug  product  is  considered  justified  in  view  of  (a) 
the  established  surrogate  (drug  substance  particle  size  control)  and  (b)  applying  a  comprehensive 
control strategy (design space on composition and process; upstream/in-process controls).  
Based  on  the  evidence  of  stability  of  apixaban,  the  control  of  impurities  in  the  drug  substance  is 
considered sufficient to ensure the quality of the drug product at release because the impurity content 
of the drug product comes only from process-related impurities contained in the drug substance. Thus, 
the proposal not to test for impurities/degradants for batch release is considered justified. 
Batch  analysis  data  for  five  batches  of  the  commercial  formulation  (from  two  sites  (including  the 
proposed one) have been presented. All results comply with the specifications and for these bathes. 
Results from 8 batches of the Phase 3 formulation provided were also within specifications. In addition 
results  from  a  number  of  batches  of  early  development  formulations  were  presented  all  within 
specifications.  
Page 10/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  are  presented  for  three  batches  stored  under  long  term  conditions  at  5°C, 
25°C/60%RH and 30°C/65%RH up to 24 months and under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75%RH up 
to 6 months. An increase (approximately 1%-2%) in water content values was observed for the tablets 
packaged  in  PVC/PVDC  blisters.  However,  there  was  no  impact  on  any  other  attributes.  All  tested 
parameters are within the proposed specification. 
Additional  data  were  presented  from  studies  under  stress  conditions  (50°C,  25°C/60%  RH  open, 
40°C/75%RH open, photostability (as per ICH) and freeze-thaw cycling). The results indicate that the 
drug  product  is  stable  under  all  stress  conditions  employed  and  that  any  changes  observed  did  not 
impact  any  critical  quality  attributes  of  the  tablets  such  as  appearance,  potency,  impurities  or 
dissolution. 
The overall data support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Eliquis film coated tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with 
the conditions defined in the SmPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug 
substance  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  quality  of  the  active  substance  is 
considered  sufficiently  described  and  adequately  supported  by  data.  Sufficient  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  product 
has been presented. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product 
quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Apixaban  inhibits  free  factor  Xa  (FXa)  as  well  as  thrombus-associated  FXa  and  FXa  within  the 
prothrombinase complex. Unlike the direct inhibitors of FXa, apixaban does not require antithrombin III 
to  inhibit  FXa.  By  inhibiting  FXa,  apixaban  reduces  directly  tissue  factor-induced  thrombin  generation 
and indirectly thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation,  suggesting that it  may prevent and treat both 
venous  as  well  as  arterial  thrombosis.  The  major  circulating  metabolite  of  apixaban,  O-desmethyl 
apixaban sulfate, does not significantly inhibit human FXa. 
In  diabetic/obese  mice,  twice  daily  dosing  of  apixaban  significantly  decreased  elevated  levels  of 
thrombotic  biomarkers.  In  a  broad  range  of  experimental  models  of  thrombosis  in  rabbits,  rats,  and 
dogs,  apixaban  demonstrated  antithrombotic  efficacy  at  doses  that  resulted  in  modest  changes  in 
standard  coagulation  assays.  Substantial  prevention  of  both  venous  and  arterial  thrombosis  was 
achieved  at  apixaban  doses  that  produced  minor  changes  in  bleeding  times,  while  higher  doses 
resulted in more pronounced increases in clotting times and bleeding times. In addition, apixaban also 
effectively  inhibited  the  growth  of  a  preformed  intravascular  thrombus,  suggesting  the  potential 
opportunities for apixaban in the treatment of thrombosis.  
In  conclusion,  the  results  showed  that  apixaban  is  a  highly  potent,  selective,  rapid  and  reversible 
inhibitor of the human coagulation factor Xa.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  the  ligand  binding  and  enzymatic  assays,  apixaban  did  not  significantly  alter  ligand  binding  or 
activity (≥50% of control) in any of the assays, thereby suggesting high selectivity of apixaban for FXa.  
Next to these assays, no other secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  to  examine  the  potential  effects  of  apixaban  on 
cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems. 
Cardiovascular system 
The  potential  effects of  apixaban  on  the  cardiovascular  system  were  evaluated  in in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
safety pharmacology and nonclinical toxicology studies, including the in vitro hERG and rabbit Purkinje 
fiber assay, 2 single-dose (oral and IV) cardiovascular telemetry studies in beagle dogs, an escalating 
IV  dose  cardiovascular  study  in  mongrel  dogs,  a  3-month  and  1-year  oral  toxicity  study in  dogs  with 
cardiovascular assessment.  
In  addition,  the  potential  effect  of  the  major  metabolite,  O-desmethyl  apixaban  sulfate,  on  the 
cardiovascular system was evaluated independently utilizing in vitro assays.  
At concentrations highly exceeding the human recommended dose, apixaban and its metabolite had no 
significant effects in the hERG and Purkinje fiber assay, indicating a low probability for prolongation of 
the  QT  interval  and  the  action  potential  duration.  In  anesthetised  dogs,  apixaban  caused  death  and 
adverse  cardiovascular  effects.  However,  these  adverse  effects  are  most  likely  related  to  the 
combination  of  anaesthesia  and  the  vehicle  used  to  deliver  apixaban,  since  no  adverse  effects  were 
observed  following  administration  of  apixaban  to  conscious  dogs  at  doses  that  induce  higher  Cmax 
values than those reached in the anesthetised dogs. All doses tested are highly exceeding the human 
recommended dose.  
Respiratory system 
In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  that  included  assessment  of  respiratory  rates,  lung  sounds  (thoracic 
auscultation),  and/or  arterial  oxygen  saturation  in  dogs,  apixaban  caused  no  adverse  findings  at  the 
highest doses tested (dog ≤ 20 mg/kg/day for up to 3 months, AUC is 41× the clinical AUC).   
Central nervous system 
Neurologic evaluations assessed mental state, gait, posture, cranial nerve function (assessed through 
menace  response,  pupillary  light  response,  lid  blink,  eye  retraction,  gag  reflex,  eye  position  at  rest, 
muscle palpation, and tongue examination) and peripheral nerve function (muscle tone, spinal reflexes, 
and postural reactions). In addition, body temperature was measured.   
In  a  3-month  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs,  apixaban  produced  no  neurologic  changes 
indicative of CNS toxicity at AUC values 41× the clinical AUC. 
In  conclusion,  at  doses  highly  exceeding  the  human  recommended  dose,  apixaban  did  not  induce 
respiratory or CNS toxicity.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In  rabbits,  the  combination  apixaban  with  aspirin  and/or  clopidogrel  significantly  enhanced 
antithrombotic activity without excessive increases in bleeding time. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  methods  used  in  the  different  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  studies  were  well-
described  and  properly  validated.  Results  of  interday  precision,  intraday  precision,accuracy  and 
stability were satisfactory. 
Absorption 
Page 12/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro data with excised segments of rat duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, showed that apixaban 
is  absorbed  throughout  the  rat  intestinal  tract.  The  permeability  coefficient  in  the  jejunum  provided 
evidence for involvement of an intestinal efflux transport mechanism.  
A  range  of  in  vitro  studies  in  monolayers  of  Caco-2  cells  expressing  a  number  of  efflux  transporters 
including  P-gp  and  BCRP,  porcine  kidney-derived  cells  (LLC-PK1)  transfected  with  P-gp  transporters, 
canine kidney-derived (MDCKII) cells transfected with BCRP transporters, indicated that apixaban is a 
substrate  for  both  P-gp  and  BCRP,  and  it  is  not  transported  by  MRP  or  OAT1,  OAT3,  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 transporters. These active transport mechanisms may play a role in the limited 
bioavailability  after  oral  administration  of  apixaban.  In  addition,  evidence  was  found  for  paracellular 
transport.  
Absorption may also be limited by dissolution rate (at high doses).  
Single dose pharmacokinetics 
In  a  comparative  study  elimination  half-life  in  rats  (2-3  hrs)  was  shorter  than  in  dogs  (5-6  hrs)  and 
chimpanzees (5-7 hrs). Distribution volume is relatively low in rats (0.31 L/kg), dogs (0.30 L/kg) and 
chimpanzees  (0.17  L/kg).  Clearance  (rat  4.3  ml/min/kg,  dog  0.87  ml/min/kg,  chimpanzee  0.30 
ml/min/kg) is low (10, 2 and 1% respectively) compared to hepatic blood flow.  
The toxicokinetic data show that exposure increases less than dose-proportional. In particular at high 
doses and in the dietary studies exposure hardly increased with increasing dose. There is no evidence 
of  sex-related  differences.  In  some  studies  exposure 
increases  somewhat  with  prolonged 
administration, but this is not consistently found in all studies.  
Distribution 
Plasma  to  blood  ratios  of  about  one  in  dog  and  human  blood  indicate  uniform  distribution  between 
plasma and red blood cells and thus no specific distribution to red blood cells. 
Protein  binding  differs  between  the  species.  The  unbound  fraction  at  concentrations  of  1-10  µM  is 
about 13% in human vs about 4% in rats and 8% in dogs. At the tested concentrations there was no 
effect  of  concentration  or  gender.  In  mice  protein  binding  is  much  lower,  with  44-67  %  unbound, 
dependent on the tested concentration (range 100 – 2000 ng apixaban/ml). These differences between 
the species used in the toxicological studies and humans should be taken into account in interpreting 
the toxicology studies. 
Two single dose radiolabel distribution studies were provided in rats. The data show a wide distribution, 
with  the  highest  values  in  excretory  organs  (liver,  kidney,  urinary  bladder  (and  contents),  bile)  and 
intestinal tract (and contents). After a dose of 20 mg/kg in male Long-Evans rats also relatively high 
Cmax and AUC were found in adrenals, lungs, thyroid gland, but after a dose  of 5 mg/kg in Sprague 
Dawley rats (both sexes) these organs showed Cmax similar to most other organs and tissues. There 
was no qualitative difference in distribution between male and female rats, but the female rats showed 
higher Cmax values in the intestinal tract.  
Distribution in pregnant rats/fetuses: Cmax in amnion was high. Significant concentrations were found 
in  placenta  and  fetal  blood,  kidney  and  liver.  Toxicokinetic  data  collected  in  the  reproductive  and 
developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  mice  and  rabbits  showed  that  generally  fetal  plasma 
concentrations of apixaban were lower than those in the dams.  
Distribution  to  rat  milk:  Pregnant  rats  showed  a  high  Cmax  in  mammary  gland.  Concentrations  of 
apixaban in rat milk exceed those in blood and plasma. The  high concentration in milk vs plasma (at 
the plasma Tmax (0.5 hr)  8.5 fold, AUC in milk was about 30 fold plasma AUC) suggests involvement 
of  active  transport  (possibly  BCRP  transporter).  Elimination  half  life  from  rat  milk,  blood  and  plasma 
was similar. 
Metabolism 
Apixaban is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4/5 with conjugation via SULT1A1, but several other CYP and 
SULT isozymes are also involved. No apixaban metabolites were found to have pharmacological activity 
and there were no unique human metabolites. 
Excretion 
After single oral administration of radiolabelled apixaban to intact male mice, male rats, female rabbits 
or male dogs, most of the dose was excreted in faeces (in mice about 70% in the first 12 hrs, in rats 
and dogs about 70% in the first 48 hrs, and in female rabbits about 55 % in the first 48 hrs) and most 
of the remainder of the dose in urine (mice about 14% in the first 12 hrs, rats 11-13% in 48 hrs, dogs 
about 8.5% in 48 hrs, and female rabbits much less : 2% in 48hrs). Bile-duct cannulated rats showed 
that  part  of  the  dose  was  eliminated  by  the  biliary  route  (about  3%  over  a  48  hr  period  after  oral 
gavage). After intravenous infusion intact male rats or female rabbits excreted a larger part into urine 
Page 13/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(male  rats  21%  and  female  rabbits  23%  in  24  hrs).  Intravenously  treated  bile-duct  cannulated  rats 
excreted even more into urine (47% in 24 hrs) and also a large part into bile (23% in 24 hrs). Most of 
the faecally  and urinary eliminated material consists of parent compound. A large part of the faecally 
cleared  material  is  probably  unabsorbed  apixaban.  Furthermore,  there  is  evidence  for  secretion  of 
apixaban  and  metabolites  into  the  intestine  which  is  mostly  likely  caused  by  excretion  via  P-
glycoprotein.  The  rabbit  data  showed  a  much  larger  extent  of  biotransformation  (larger  role  of 
metabolic clearance) in this species compared to the other species. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Apixaban is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP; inhibition was only observed at concentrations 25 times 
the  maximal  observed  human  plasma  concentrations.  In  addition,  apixaban  does  not  affect  the 
absorption  of  drugs  that  are  P-glycoprotein  substrates.  Since  apixaban  is  a  substrate  for  CYP3A4/5, 
BCRP,  and  P-glycoprotein,  co-administration  of  drugs  that  modulate  their  activities  could  affect  the 
absorption  and  disposition  of  apixaban.  However,  the  relatively  low  dependence  of  apixaban  on 
metabolic  clearance  for  its  elimination  and  the  multiple  pathways  available  for  apixaban  elimination 
(renal and biliary clearance and, possibly, intestinal secretion) suggests that any such effects are likely 
to be of relatively low magnitude. Since apixaban is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter, its 
absorption  may  be  affected  by  P-glycoprotein  inhibitors.  The  SmPC  advises  caution  when  co-
administering  apixaban with strong inhibitors and inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. 
Other pharmacokinetics studies 
In  fasted  beagle  dogs,  bioavailability  of  apixaban  was  reduced  (up  to  50%)  by  active  charcoal 
treatment,  given  0.25  –  3  hrs  after  the  oral  apixaban  dose.  The  highest  reduction  was  found  when 
activated charcoal was administered 3 hrs after the apixaban dose (1 hour before Tmax). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  oral  studies  in  mice  (up  to  4000  mg/kg),  rats  (up  to  4510  mg/kg),  dogs  (up  to  1500 
mg/kg) and cynomolgus monkeys (up to 300 mg/kg) revealed no other drug-related effects than those 
related to the pharmacodynamic action of apixaban. In particular some monkeys died due to excessive 
bleeding after blood sampling. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  the  repeated  dose  studies,  up  to  6  months  with  a  recovery  phase  in  rats  (doses  up  to  600 
mg/kg/day, AUC up to apixaban up to 30 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID) and to 1 year in 
dogs  (doses  up  to  100  mg/kg/day,  AUC  up  to  >  80  times  human  AUC  at  a  dose  of  2.5  mg  BID), 
apixaban  showed  no  significant  toxicity.  The  major  observed  effects  were  those  on  blood  coagulation 
parameters:  PT  and  aPTT  and,  sometimes,  fibrinogen  and/or  bleeding  time.  In  some  studies,  minor 
effects on blood cells and/or on serum K, Na and/or Cl and/or evidence of subclinical haemorrhage was 
observed.    Exposure  to  the  major  metabolite  O-demethyl  apixaban  sulfate  was  not  measured  in  the 
pivotal  long  term  repeated  dose  studies.  However,  based  on  separate  7-day  repeated  dose 
pharmacokinetics  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  systemic  exposure  to  the  metabolite  was  lower  than  in 
humans in the rat study and about similar to that in humans in the dog study. It is concluded that the 
metabolite has been tested in the pivotal studies, but that these studies reveal no exposure margin for 
the metabolite. Since conjugates are usually not more toxic than the unconjugated compounds, and in 
addition to the toxicity studies with limited exposure there were data showing the absence of effects of 
the  metabolite  in  pharmacodynamic  and  safety  pharmacology  studies,  no  further  toxicity  data  were 
deemed necessary.   
Genotoxicity 
Based on a battery of four genotoxicity assays (gene mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations 
in  vitro  in  CHO  cells  and  in  two  in  vivo  assays  in  rat  bone  marrow  (micronucleus  assay)  and  rat 
peripheral blood lymphocytes) there was no evidence for genotoxicity of apixaban under the conditions 
of the assays. 
Page 14/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Two  2 year carcinogenicity studies were provided. In both studies apixaban was administered via the 
dietary route, up to a dose of 1500 mg/kg/day in male mice and 3000 mg/kg/day in female mice and 
up to a dose of 600 mg/kg in rats. Sufficient toxicokinetic data were provided. Both the mouse and the 
rat carcinogenicity study suggest a slight increase of tumours (benign – increased endometrial polyps - 
in the mice, malignant – lymphoma - in the rats) at the highest dose level, however, with incidences 
still  within  the  range  of  historical  controls.  Taking  into  account  the  provided  historical  data,  the 
negative genotoxicity results and the absence of non-genotoxic toxicity which might lead to epigenetic 
tumour induction at high doses, it is concluded that it is most likely that the results are due to normal 
variability. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In an oral fertility/early embryonic development study no effects on male or female fertility or on early 
embryonic development was found at tested doses of 0, 50, 200 and 600 mg apixaban/kg/day (from 2 
weeks  before  mating  through  GD7  (females)  or  sacrifice  (males)).  The  NOAEL  was  600  mg/kg/day 
(AUC 28 µg.h/ml in males and 36 µg.h/ml in females). 
Embryo-foetal  developmental  studies  were  done  in  rats  (doses  100-3000  mg/kg/day),  mice  (doses 
600-1500 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (oral : 60 -1500 mg/kg/day, intravenous : 1.25 – 5 mg/kg/day). In 
rats  systemic  exposure  was  confirmed,  but  no  AUC  was  determined.  However,  based  on  limited 
measurements  of  plasma  apixaban  concentrations  in  the  embryo-foetal  developmental  study  and  the 
exposure data from other rat studies it is plausible that exposure has been high enough. In mice, the 
AUC  was  >  13  times  human  AUC  at  a  dose  of  2.5  mg  BID.  In  the  rabbit  study,  exposure  after  oral 
(AUC < human AUC) as well as intravenous (AUC 2.5 times human AUC) administration remained low. 
The mouse study was added because of the low exposure in the rabbit study. In all three species, fetal 
plasma  apixaban  concentrations  were  lower  than  in  the  dam.  The  only  observed  effect  during  these 
studies consisted of red perivaginal substance in the rat study, presumably due to hemorrhage caused 
by the pharmacodynamic action of apixaban.  
In a rat pre/postnatal development study at doses of 0, 25, 200 and 1000 mg apixaban/kg/day from 
GD6 – post partum day 20, the only effects found in dams in addition to expected increases of PT and 
aPTT were increased incidence of red liquid/mucoid vaginal discharge. The only observed effects on the 
offspring  were  a  slightly  reduced  mating  and  fertility  indices  in  the  F1  females.  Although  considered 
drug  related  the  values  were  within  the  historical  control  range.  In  the  absence  of  other  changes  on 
reproduction  or  development,  the  relevance  of  this  finding  for  the  clinical  practice  is  doubtful.    The 
NOAEL  for  maternal  toxicity,  and  F1  male  development  was  1000  mg/kg/day  (AUC  39  times  human 
AUC) and for F1 female reproduction 25 mg/kg/day (AUC 9.75 times human AUC).  
Other toxicity studies 
Juvenile toxicity study 
An exploratory juvenile rat toxicity study was done, in which cross-fostered rat pups were treated from 
postnatal day (PND) 4 to PND 23. Tested doses were 0, 25, 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day. On PND 23 the 
animals  were  sacrificed.  No  adverse  effects  were  found.  Toxicokinetic  data  show  a  relatively  high 
systemic exposure on PND 10 with plasma concentrations at expected Tmax about 3-6 times the Cmax 
at PND23. This age-related systemic exposure is considered to reflect metabolic maturation of juvenile 
rats  between  PND  4  and  23.  The  AUC  at  the  highest  tested  dose  at  PND  23  was  about  50  times  the 
human AUC. According to the non-clinical overview a definitive 90-day study (with 1 months recovery 
phase)  in  juvenile  rats  dosed  from  PND4  to  90  is  currently  ongoing  with  doses  of  10,  50,  and  600 
mg/kg/day to support potential pediatric use.  
Impurities 
Since there are no impurities above the ICH qualification threshold of 0.15%, no further toxicity data 
of impurities are required. All potential genotoxic impurities are below the level of 150 ppm, resulting 
in  a  maximum  exposure  to  below  the  TTC  as  defined  in  the  Guideline  on  the  limits  of  genotoxic 
impurities (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006) and the Q&A document of this guideline. 
Phototoxicity 
Based on an in vitro photoxicity test (3T3 NRU PT) in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts there is no evidence 
for phototoxic potential of apixaban.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) in surface water (PECsurface water) calculated in Phase I 
exceeded the trigger value of 0.01μg/L and a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was 
undertaken.  
In phase II, the Fpen was refined. A PECsurfacewater of 0.00125 μg/L was calculated using this refined Fpen. 
Based on this PECsurfacewater value, the trigger value for Phase II Tier A assessment of 0.01 μg/L is not 
exceeded.  
Although not necessary, the applicant provided a Phase II Tier A assessment. Using the No Observed 
Effect Concentrations (NOEC) from the Phase II Tier A studies, Predicted No Effect Concentrations 
(PNEC) were calculated using appropriate assessment factors. 
The following values were obtained: 
PNECmicroorganism = 100,000 μg/L 
PNECsurface water = 360μg/L 
PNECgroundwater = 960μg/L 
The PEC/PNEC ratios were below the trigger values for further studies in the aquatic environment or on 
microorganisms and based on the Koc value,  a risk assessment for the terrestrial compartment is not 
needed.  
Apixaban was not readily biodegradable and significant amounts shift into the sediment, therefore 
effects on sediment-dwelling organisms were investigated in Phase II Tier B.

The  appropriate  studies  have  been  conducted  according  to  existing  guidelines  and  have  been  found 
valid for use in the risk assessment. Based on the results of the Applicants' Phase II Tier A assessment, 
no adverse effects of apixaban are expected for the STP, surface water and groundwater compartment. 
Based on the results of the Applicants' Phase II Tier B assessment, no adverse effects of apixaban are 
expected  for  the  sediment  compartment.  The  overall  conclusion  is  that  no  adverse  effects  on  the 
environment are expected for apixaban.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic documentation were clear and satisfactory.  
With regard to toxicology, the issues below were raised during assessment for further clarification.  
1) The exposure to the major human metabolite O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate was relatively low in all 
animal toxicity studies, due to low formation in the animal species in spite of very high exposure to the 
parent compound. As a consequence the value of the toxicity studies for the safety assessment of this 
metabolite is very limited and additional data on the toxicity of this metabolite, e.g. by administering 
the  metabolite  instead  of  the  parent  compound,  or  for  justification  of  not  providing  such  data  was 
further requested during assessment. 
Based on the additional documentation submitted, it was concluded that Ο-desmethyl apixaban sulfate 
is  not  pharmacologically  active  and  showed  no  significant  activity  in  in  vitro  cardiovascular  safety 
studies. However exposure at the highest dose levels in the repeated dose studies is not high enough 
to justify any margin of exposure for the toxicity studies. Since conjugates are usually not more toxic 
than  the  unconjugated  compounds,  and  because  some  results  from  pharmacodynamic  and  safety 
pharmacology  studies  were  available  in  addition  to  the  toxicity  studies  with  limited  exposure,  no 
further toxicity data are requested.  
Page 17/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)  In  spite  of  very  high  systemic  exposure,  the  toxicity  studies  hardly  showed  any  toxicity  related  to 
the anticoagulatory effect of apixaban.  
Therefore,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  sensitivity  of  the  animal  species  for  the 
pharmacodynamic  effect  compared  to  humans  for  the  interpretation  of  the  non-clinical  results,  which 
suggest little risk of bleeding, even at overdose, e.g. around parturition. 
Based  on  the  additional  documentation  provided,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  based  on  Cmax  values 
there is about a factor 3 – 5 between the highest values obtained in the long-term toxicity studies in 
rats and dogs and the lowest values at which significant pharmacodynamic effects were found. This is 
consistent  with  a  difference  in  sensitivity  between  the  tested  species  and  humans.  The  low  bleeding 
tendency  found  in  toxicity  studies  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  when  extrapolating  to  humans. 
The point can be acceptable, provided that the following sentence is added to section 5.3. of the SMPC: 
“In the toxicity studies little to  no increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may 
be  due  to  a  lower  sensitivity  of  the  non-clinical  species  compared  to  humans,  this  result  should  be 
interpreted with caution when extrapolating to humans.” 
The CHMP raised the issue of potential hepatotoxicity referring to existing data in dogs at a dose of 30 
mg/kg suggesting hepatotoxicity at a systemic exposure of 171 μg x hr/ml. The MAH provided further 
clarification on the results. It was concluded by the CHMP that the way of reporting the results of the 
two different histopathological assessments of the liver had caused confusion that needed to be further 
explained. After further review of the histopathological results of the other repeated dose studies, the 
CHMP agreed with the applicant that overall there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity.  
The GLP status of some laboratories which carried out pivotal toxicity studies was further clarified and 
solved during the assessment. All pivotal safety studies were GLP-compliant, according to the study 
reports.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall  preclinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety 
pharmacology,  repeated dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity, carcinogenic  potential,  fertility  and embryo-foetal 
development. In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with apixaban there were decreases in mating 
and  fertility.  These  effects  were  minimal  and  observed  only  at  exposures  considered  sufficiently  in 
excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
The  major  observed  effects  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  those  related  to  the 
pharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to 
no increase of bleeding tendency was found.  
However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of the non-clinical species compared to humans, 
this result should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to human. This is highlighted in the 
SmPC.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical pharmacology profile of apixaban has been characterized based on the results of 26 clinical 
pharmacology  studies.  To  support  the  current  proposed  indication  four  additional  studies  were 
conducted (1 phase II, 3 phase III). There are 6 ongoing Phase III and 1 ongoing Phase II randomized, 
controlled  apixaban  studies  that  will  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  in  other  indications  (prevention  of 
stroke and systemic embolism in AF, VTE treatment, secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome 
and VTE prevention in subjects with acute medical illness).  
GCP 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Apixaban is an orally active, direct, selective inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa) that reversibly 
binds  directly  to  the  active  site  of  FXa.  The  proposed  dose  in  adults  for  prevention  of  VTE  is  2.5  mg 
administered  orally  twice  daily.  The  clinical  pharmacology  profile  of  apixaban  has  been  characterized 
based  on  the  results  of  26  clinical  pharmacology  studies  as  well  as  population  PK  and  exposure-
response analyses that incorporated data from Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 studies. 
Analytical methods 
All  analytical  methods  fulfilled  all  current  requirements  and  recommendations  regarding  linearity, 
precision, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Validation and analytical reports were submitted.  
Absorption  
 
bioavailability 
The  Cmax  of  apixaban  is  reached  approximately  3  to  4  h  after  dose  administration.  The  absolute 
bioavailability of orally administered apixaban is approximately 52%. Apixaban appears to be absorbed 
primarily  from  the  upper  GI  tract,  proximal  to  the  colon.  Apixaban  bioavailability  was  altered  in  the 
presence of CYP3A4 and P-gp modulators (see below). Apixaban was found to be a substrate for efflux 
transport proteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro. 
  Bioequivalence 
The  comparative  bioavailability  study  (CV185024)  was  conducted  to  further  understand  the 
performance of the Phase 2 wet-granulation tablet with respect to the Phase 3 dry-granulation tablet.  
It  was  shown  that  the  results  with  the  phase  II  tablets  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  phase  III  and 
commercial  products.  Additionally  it  was  shown  that  small  changes  in  dissolution  rate  seem  not  to 
affect the overall extent of absorption.  
 
Food interaction 
The  food  interaction  studies  showed  sufficiently  that  the  apixaban  phase  II  tablet  has  no  clinical 
significant  food  interaction.  Consistent  with  these  results,  apixaban  is  proposed  for  administration 
without regard to food. 
Distribution 
Following  an  IV  bolus  dose,  mean  steady-state  volume  of  distribution  for  apixaban  was  ~  21  L.  In 
human serum, in vitro protein binding was 87% at 0.46 g/mL, while protein binding in serum taken 
from humans following apixaban administration (apixaban concentrations of 0.068 to 0.22 g/mL) was 
~93%. In vitro, binding of apixaban to 1-acid glycoprotein (9%) was less than its degree of binding 
to  human  serum  albumin  (66%).  It  is  unlikely  that  saturation  of  binding  or  drug-drug  interactions 
mediated by 1-acid glycoprotein binding will occur. The concentration of apixaban-related compounds 
in erythrocytes was less than that in plasma (blood:plasma ratio of 0.7 to 0.8). 
Elimination and metabolism 
Apixaban  is  eliminated  by  multiple  pathways  including  metabolism,  renal  clearance  and  biliary 
clearance;  nonclinical  data  suggest  that  direct  intestinal  secretion  may  also  be  involved.  The  mean 
total cumulative recovery over the 9-day period was approximately 77%. Of the TRA recovered in the 
urine,  approximately  85%  was  apixaban  parent  and  ~80%  was  recovered  within  24  h  after  dosing. 
Recovery of TRA in the urine paralleled the disappearance of apixaban from plasma for that period. The 
TRA recovered in the faeces, concerned for the major part unchanged parent (~34%). Biliary excretion 
contributed to the elimination of apixaban and several metabolites. The radioactivity identified in biliary 
excreta  during  the  5-h  collection  window  (approximately  5%  of  TRA  recovery)  suggested  that  fecal 
recovery consisted of both absorbed and unabsorbed drug since the fecal recovery of TRA was larger 
than that seen in bile. 
O-desmethyl  apixaban  sulfate  (M1)  was  the  major  circulating  metabolite.  O-desmethyl  apixaban 
sulfate  does  not  have  meaningful  pharmacologic  activity.  Additional  metabolites  identified  in  plasma 
Page 19/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
included:  O-desmethyl  apixaban  (M2),  3-hydroxy  apixaban  (M7),  and  hydroxylated  O-desmethyl 
apixaban sulfate-1 (M10). The total radioactivity in circulation attributed to all 3 metabolites together 
was  less  than  3%.    Metabolites  accounted  for  approximately  25%  of  recovered  TRA.  The  in  vitro 
formation  of O-desmethyl  apixaban  was  primarily  mediated  by CYP3A4  and 3A5  with  relatively  minor 
contributions  of CYP1A2 and CYP2J2; a low level of formation was catalyzed by CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19.  Sulfate  conjugation  was  mediated  primarily  by  SULT1A1  with  minor  activity  observed  for 
SULT1A3, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  O-desmethyl  apixaban  sulfate  (M1),  the  major  metabolite  of  apixaban  was 
difficult to establish due to the low concentrations. The M1:apixaban ratio was consistent across dose 
groups ranging from 13 to 16%. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Apixaban exhibits linear PK dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg for the tablet formulation in healthy volunteers. 
Apixaban  AUC(INF)  increased  in  proportion  to  increases  in  IV  dose  from  0.5  to  5  mg.  There  was  no 
indication of time-dependent pharmacokinetics. 
Variability 
Within-subject  variability  of  apixaban  PK  parameters  was  approximately  20%.  The  between-subject 
variability in the exposure of apixaban was 30% to 40% for AUC parameters and independent of dose. 
Inter-individual variability in PK parameters is slightly higher in patients (~40% CV). 
General pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and patients 
Based  on  pooled  analysis  of  PO  doses  between  2.5  and  10  mg,  the  terminal  T-half  of  apixaban  is 
approximately 8-13 h. The shorter T-half observed following administration of PO doses <2.5 mg may 
reflect  the  inability  to  fully  characterize  the  terminal  phase  with  an  assay  LLOQ  of  1  ng/mL.  No 
pharmacokinetics  were  measured  in  patients  using  full  pharmacokinetic  sampling.  Apixaban  PK  in 
subjects  who  received  apixaban  for  VTEp  following  TKR  or  THR  are  described  by  the  population  PK 
analysis.  In  general,  the  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  (age,  gender,  body  weight,  renal  function) 
characterized  in  Phase  1  clinical  pharmacology  studies  accounted  for  the  differences  in  exposure 
observed between the Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 study participants. In addition, surgery accounted for a 
transient 24% reduction in apixaban CLT/F in the first 3 days following surgery. 
To date, apixaban has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women. The effects of smoking, diet 
composition, herbal products and alcohol use on the PK of apixaban have not been specifically studied 
in the apixaban development program. 
Intrinsic factors 
Mild to moderate hepatic impairment had no effect on apixaban PK or PD. However, representation of 
patients  with  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  (based  on  Child-Pugh  classification)  in  study 
CV185025 is limited, which is reflected in the SmPC. Higher apixaban exposures, up to approximately 
30%, were observed for intrinsic factors such as age, female gender,  or low body weight ( 50 kg).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based  on  nonclinical  data,  the  potential  for  other  drugs  to  affect  apixaban  exposure  appear  to  be 
primarily  related  to  the  inhibition  or  induction  of  CYP3A4  and  3A5  metabolism  and/or  P-gp  mediated 
efflux and represented the greatest potential for drug interactions involving apixaban.  
Ketoconazole  (a  strong  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and  P-gp)  had  the  largest  effect  on  apixaban  PK 
(approximately  2-fold  increase  in  exposure).  Co-administration  of  apixaban  with  such  agents  is  not 
recommended.  
Diltiazem, a less potent CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, resulted in a 40% increase in apixaban exposure.  
Naproxen,  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp,  resulted  in  an  approximately  60%  increase  in  apixaban  exposure. 
Naproxen appeared to affect apixaban bioavailability via inhibition of P-gp mediated transport. 
Rifampin  (a  strong  CYP  inducer  and  P-gp  inducer)  reduced  apixaban  exposure  by  ~40%  after  IV 
administration  and  ~  50%  after  PO  administration;  bioavailability  was  reduced  25%  by  rifampin.  In 
light  of  the  decrease  in  exposure  following  induction,  care  should  be  taken  when  administering 
apixaban with strong inducers of CYP enzymes or P-gp. 
Page 20/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Famotidine had no effect on apixaban pharmacokinetics. This indicates that apixaban PK are not likely 
to  be  altered  by  alterations  in  gastric  pH  or  coadministration  with  organic  cation  transporter  (OCT) 
inhibitors.  
Coadministration of enoxaparin with apixaban had no clinical significant effect on apixaban exposure.   
Apixaban  has  little  potential  to  affect  the  PK  of  other  P-gp  substrates  based  on  the  lack  of  effect  on 
digoxin exposure, a commonly used P-gp substrate. In addition, in vitro data indicate that apixaban is 
not  likely  to  alter  the  metabolism  of  other  drugs.  Apixaban  did  not  influence  pharmacokinetics  of 
naproxen  or  atenolol.  Based  on  a  phase  I  study,  no  significant  interaction  between  apixaban  and 
aspirin or clopidogrel were seen on some bleeding parameters (see later for clinical experience). 
Therefore, the potential for apixaban to affect the PK of concomitantly administered medications seems 
to be low. 
Apixaban  was  found  to  be  a  substrate  for  efflux transport  proteins  P-gp  and  breast  cancer  resistance 
protein (BCRP). P-gp is also called ABCB1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1, and MDR1.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Apixaban  is  an  orally  active,  direct,  selective  inhibitor  of  coagulation  factor  Xa  (FXa)  that  reversibly 
binds  directly  to  the  active  site  of  FXa,  and  exerts  anticoagulant  and  antithrombotic  effects  by 
diminishing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (Fig PD1).  
Figure PD1: Schematic representation of blood coagulation. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The PD effects of apixaban include inhibitory effects on FXa activity, the prolongation of clotting tests 
such  as  PT/INR,  aPTT,  and  mPT,  as  well  as  ex  vivo  thrombin  generation.  The  effect  of  apixaban  on 
anti-Xa activity was assessed in multiple clinical trials with the Rotachrom®  Heparin assay, covering a 
range  of  2.5  to  20  mg.  Concentration-related  increases  in  anti-Xa  activity  were  observed  following 
administration of apixaban (fig PD2). 
Page 21/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure PD2: Anti-Xa Activity vs Apixaban Plasma Concentration 
Although  apixaban  does  not  require  monitoring,  the  Rotachrom®  Heparin  assay  is  one  available 
method to measure anti-Xa. The  feasibility of this assay in clinical practice is discussed in the clinical 
section. Following administration of apixaban single PO doses of 2.5 to 50 mg, dose-related increases 
in  International  Normalised  Ratio  (INR)  and  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT)  were 
observed.  
Single  doses  of  apixaban  produced  transient,  dose-related  changes  in  parameters  of  the  thrombin 
generation  curve,  consistent  with  a  direct  factor  Xa  inhibitor.  Such  activity  was  evident  over  a  12  h 
dosing interval in line with the proposed dosing. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation. 
The  actual  clinical  implications  when  apixaban  is  co-administered  with  platelet  aggregation  inhibitors 
will be further discussed under safety.  
Secondary Pharmacology 
Study  CV185031  investigated  the  QT prolongation potential  of apixaban  in a  thorough QT/QTc  study. 
This  is  an  appropriately  designed  study  where  administered  doses  were  much  higher  than  those 
proposed in the current indication (up to 50 mg compared to the proposed 2.5 mg BID).  
The  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  placebo-adjusted  change  in  QTcF  after  treatment  with 
moxifloxacin  was  >5  msec,  confirming  assay  sensitivity.  The  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the 
placebo-adjusted differences for both apixaban doses were < 10 msec, indicating that apixaban had no 
relevant effect on the QTcF interval in contrast to moxifloxacin.  
This  is  further  supported  by  pre-clinical  studies  showing  that  apixaban  and  Ο-desmethyl  apixaban 
sulfate had negligible effects in the human related gene (hERG) and Purkinje-fiber assays (IC50 values 
>30 μM), indicating a low probability for QT prolongation. Available data support that apixaban has no 
relevant  effect  on  the  QTc  interval  at  concentrations  exceeding  those  anticipated  in  patients  who 
receive apixaban for VTEp following TKR or THR. 
2.4.5.  Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The effect of apixaban on anti-Xa activity was assessed in multiple clinical trials with the Rotachrom® 
Heparin  assay,  covering  a  range  of  2.5  to  20  mg.  Concentration-related  increases  in  anti-Xa  activity 
were  observed  following  administration  of  apixaban.  Although  apixaban  does  not  require  monitoring, 
the  Rotachrom  Heparin  assay  is  considered  one  method  to  measure  anti-Xa  and  can  help  in  cases 
where overdosing is suspected (refer SmPC section 5.1).   
Apixaban has no relevant effect on QTc. 
Overall, the absorption, distribution elimination and metabolism was well characterised in humans.  
The  O-desmethyl  apixaban  sulfate  is  the  major  circulating  metabolite  and  does  not  have  meaningful 
pharmacologic  activity.  Apixaban  is  eliminated  by  multiple  pathways  including  metabolism,  renal 
clearance  and  biliary  clearance;  nonclinical  data  suggest  that  direct  intestinal  secretion  may  also  be 
involved. 
Page 22/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  food  interaction  studies  showed  that  the  apixaban  phase  II  tablet  had  no  clinical  significant  food 
interaction. Therefore, apixaban is proposed for administration with or without food. 
Apixaban exhibits linear PK dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg for the tablet formulation in healthy volunteers.  
Within-subject  variability  of  apixaban  PK  parameters  was  approximately  20%.  The  between-subject 
variability in the exposure of apixaban was 30% to 40% for AUC parameters and independent of dose. 
Inter-individual variability in PK parameters is slightly higher in patients (~40% CV). 
To date apixaban has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women.  
Mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (estimated  by  Child-Pugh  classes)  had  no  influence  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  apixaban.  Severe  hepatic  impairment  or  hepatic  impairment  associated  with 
clinically-relevant coagulopathy has not been studied due to known increased bleeding risk. 
It  is  agreed that  apixaban  can be given  without  dose  adjustment to patients  with  mild  and  moderate 
hepatic impairment. Treatment of apixaban in severely hepatic impaired patients is not recommended.  
The  potential  for  other  drugs  to  affect  apixaban  exposure  appears  to  be  primarily  related  to  the 
inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 and 3A5 metabolism and/or P-gp mediated efflux and represented the 
greatest potential for drug interactions involving apixaban. 
In conclusion, the pharmacodynamic properties of apixaban are adequately characterized and in line 
with a direct FXa inhibitor.  
Regarding  pharmacokinetic  effects,  a  summary  of  the  main  conclusions  as  per  the  agreed  SmPC  is 
detailed below: 
Food effect 
ELIQUIS can be taken with or without food. 
Renal impairment 
There  is  no  clinical  experience  in  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  < 15 ml/min,  or  in  patients 
undergoing dialysis therefore, apixaban is not recommended in these patients.  
Limited  clinical  data  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  15-29 ml/min) 
indicate  that  apixaban  plasma  concentrations  are  increased  in  this  patient  population,  therefore 
apixaban is to be used with caution in these patients.  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
ELIQUIS is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically 
relevant bleeding risk. It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or 
B). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  (ALT/AST >2 x ULN)  or  total  bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN  were  excluded 
in  clinical  trials.  Therefore  Eliquis  should  be  used  with  caution  in  this  population.  ALT  should  be 
measured as part of the standard pre-operative evaluation. 
In the case of low and high body weight, the differences in apixaban, Cmax and AUC were within 30% 
and  20%  of  the  reference  group,  respectively.  The  modest  influence  of  weight  on  apixaban  PK  is 
consistent  with  its  low  volume  of  distribution  and  clearance.  These  data  indicate  that  the  effects  of 
extreme body weight were modest and it is agreed that no dose adjustment is recommended. 
No  dose  adjustment  is  required  for  elderly,  gender  and  extreme  body  weight  since  no  clinically 
significant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. 
To  date  apixaban  administration  has  only  been  studied  in  adult  subjects  (≥ 18  years  of  age)  and  no 
data are available in pediatric subjects.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Four  clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  apixaban  relative  to  enoxaparin 
(table  E1):  one  Phase  II,  dose-ranging  study  in  subjects  undergoing  TKR  surgery  (CV185010),  two 
Phase  III  pivotal  studies  in  patients  undergoing  THR  (CV185035),  and  TKR  (CV185047),  and  a 
supportive  phase  III  study  in  patients  undergoing  TKR  (CV185034).  All  4  studies  were  designed  as 
Page 23/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multi-centre, international, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled studies with a 
total of 11,964 subjects randomized.  
Table E1: Main Efficacy studies for Apixaban in VTE-p. 
BID = twice daily, DVT = deep vein thrombosis, NI = non-inferiority, PE = pulmonary embolism, RR = relative risk, 
PO = orally, SC = subcutaneous, QD = once daily, and VTE = venous thromboembolism  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The currently proposed apixaban dose is 2.5 mg BID, with the first dose administered 12-24 hours 
post surgery. 
In the dose-response study CV185010, 6 doses of apixaban: 5 and 10 QD and BID, 2.5 mg BID and 20 
mg QD were administered compared to enoxaparin 30 mg BID or warfarin in patients undergoing knee 
surgery. The main study design is outlined in Figure E1.  
Page 24/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure E1: Study design CV185010 
The study endpoints are acceptable for an exploratory study and are in line with the CHMP relevant 
guideline (CPMP/EWP/707/98 Rev.1 corr).  
Results. 
No significant dose response can be observed in the incidence of VTE/death, contrary to an obvious 
dose response for bleeding incidence (fig E2). 
Figure E2: Summary of Primary Efficacy and Bleeding Results in CV185010 
From the presented figure (E2) the dose choice appears to be limited to 2.5 bid and 5 mg QD, the only 
doses  associated  with  lower  bleeding  incidences  than  enoxaparin.  The  incidence  of  death,  or 
symptomatic  PE  appears  sporadic,  with  one  case  of  symptomatic  PE  each  in  the  apixaban  20  mg  QD 
and  10  mg  BID  and  2  in  the  enoxaparin  group,  and  one  case  of  death  in  the  apixaban  2.5  mg  BID 
(further discussed under Safety table S4). 
Twice  daily  administration  (2.5  mg  BID)  appears  to  be  associated  with  a  trend  of  better  efficacy  and 
lesser  major  bleeding  events  (0%  versus  2.6%  with  the  once  daily  administration  of  5  mg)  when 
exposure (AUC)-response is taken into account. 
The administration of the first dose of apixaban post surgery (12-24 hours post-surgery) is not in line 
with the schedule of enoxaparin administration in EU, where the first dose is administered pre-surgery. 
On  one  hand  the  motivations  for  post-surgery  application  appear  logical:  observation  of  residual 
surgery-related bleedings before starting the anti-coagulant, also allows time for removal of indwelling 
epidural catheters used for neuraxial anesthesia. Both dabigatran (treatment should be initiated orally 
within  1  –  4  hours  of  completed  surgery  with  a  single  capsule  and  continuing  with  2  capsules  once 
daily  thereafter)  and  rivaroxaban  (6  to  10  hours  after  surgery)  are  also  approved  for  post-surgery 
administration; but now apixaban allows even more delayed initiation. The possible implications of this 
delayed administration are further discussed under the results of the phase III studies.

2.5.2.  Main studies  
Three  phase  III  studies  are  submitted  to  support  the  indication.  Two  of  these  studies  CV185035  and 
CV185047  are  considered  the  pivotal  studies  to  support  the  VTEp  in  THR  and  TKR  indications 
respectively, as they employed the EU regimen of enoxaparin (40 mg QD). The third study CV185034 
is considered supportive as it employed the US regimen of enoxaparin (30 mg BID). 
Pivotal Studies 
  CV185035 and CV185047 
Objectives 
To  compare  the  effect  of  apixaban  2.5  mg  BID  PO  vs.  enoxaparin  40  mg  QD  SC  on  the  composite 
endpoint of adjudicated asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE, and all cause death at the 
end of the double-blind intended treatment period in subjects undergoing elective THR (CV185035) or 
TKR  (CV185047). 
The  key  secondary  objective  was  to compare the effect  of  apixaban  vs.  enoxaparin  on  the  composite 
endpoint  of adjudicated proximal  DVT,  nonfatal PE,  and  VTE-related  death  (major  VTE)  at the  end of 
the double-blind intended treatment period. 
Study design  
The design of the clinical studies was comparable and is depicted in figure E4. 
Figure E4: Study Design - CV185035 and CV185047 
This  design  is  in  line  with  studies  previously  submitted  for  the  approval  of  other  drugs  for  the  same 
indications. The comparator enoxaparin is administered in the EU approved dose for VTEp both in TKR 
and  THR,  of  40  mg  QD.  The  duration  of  prophylaxis  of  35  and  12  days  for  the  THR  and  TKR 
respectively is also in line with common practice guidelines.  The direct comparator used in the trial is 
enoxaparin.  
Study participants 
The  stated  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  appear  appropriate.  The  recruited  populations  in  both  studies 
suffered  from  some  symptoms  of  CV  co-morbidity,  mainly  hypertension.  Around  20%  of  the  patients 
had  repeat  surgery.  Patients  with  previous  VTE/PE  were  less  represented  (around  2%),  which  is 
acceptable.  Differences  in  co-morbidity  can  be  seen  between  the  two  pivotal  studies,  reflecting  the 
older  age  group  of  the  TKR  study.  Importantly,  the  distribution  is  balanced  between  the  treatment 
groups in each study. 
Both ASA > 165 mg/day as well as NSAIDs were not permitted pre-operatively.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  composite  of  all  adjudicated  VTE  (PE,  symptomatic  DVT, 
asymptomatic  DVT)  and  all-cause  death during the  intended treatment  period  in  subjects  undergoing 
elective  THR  surgery  (period  includes  first  day  of  randomization  and  for  treated  subjects,  the  period 
ended at the later of a) 2 days after last dose  of study drug or b) 38  days (THR) and 14 days (TKR) 
after the first dose (pre- or post-surgery) of study drug. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of adjudicated asymptomatic and symptomatic 
proximal  DVT,  non-fatal  PE,  and  VTE-related  death  during  the  intended  treatment  period  in  subjects 
undergoing elective THR/TKR surgeries. 
Diagnosis:  For  subjects  with  suspected  symptomatic  DVT  during  the  treatment  period,  a  physical 
examination  and  an  ultrasound  assessment  of  the  symptomatic  leg  were  performed.  If  diagnosis  is 
positive,  the  study  medication  was  discontinued  and  the  subject  was  treated  per  the  investigator’s 
standard  of  care.  If  the  ultrasound  was  inconclusive,  bilateral  ascending  contrast  venography  was 
performed.  If  this  was  positive,  the  subject  was  managed  as  noted  above.  If  the  ultrasound  and 
venogram  were  normal  or  indeterminate,  the  study  medication  and  study  schedule  were  continued. 
Bilateral ascending contrast venography at the end of study medication treatment was used to assess 
subjects who were asymptomatic for DVT. 
All VTE (DVT and PE) events and events leading to death were adjudicated by one independent, expert 
panel of physicians, for all 4 studies. 
Conduct of the studies 
In  study  CV185035,  the  most  important  amendment  was  Amendment  4.  The  study  sample  size  was 
subsequently increased from 4022 to 5406 to provide adequate power for the NI test for the primary 
efficacy endpoint (see before). 
In  study  CV185047:  After  the  results  of  CV185034  were  known,  the  primary  objective  in  CV185047 
was changed from a superiority assessment to a NI assessment (prior to un-blinding) (amendment 5). 
Randomisation 
Study Populations. In both studies, 8,464 subjects (4,236 on apixaban and 4,228 on enoxaparin) were 
randomized.   Within  each  study,  a  similar  proportion  of  randomized  subjects  completed  the protocol-
specified treatment period in both treatment groups (table E3). 
Table E3: Subject Disposition at the End of Treatment Period - Randomized Subjects 
Page 27/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  majority  (61.6%)  of  randomized  subjects  in  CV185035  and  CV185047  were  enrolled  in  Europe. 
The countries with the greatest proportions of randomized subjects were Russia (10.1%) and Ukraine 
(9.4%).  
Baseline data 
The  subjects  randomized  in  each  study  were  representative  of  the  population  encountered  in  clinical 
practice. 
Both  randomized  groups  appear  well  matched  in  each  study.  Most  of  the  patients  were  white,  with 
Asian  representation  more  apparent  in  the  TKR  study.  Patients  >75  are  well  represented  in  the  TKR 
indication (around 19%), but less so in the THR study (around 12%), which probably also reflects the 
distribution  in  the  target  population.  Patients  with  BMI  ≥  33  kg/m2  were  also  adequately  recruited 
(around 400 patients per treatment group in THR and more than 300 patients in TKR). 
Recruitment 
It  is  not  possible  to  classify  the  recruited  patients  based  on  the  Child-Pugh  classification  of  hepatic 
impairment as some parameters were not measured at baseline (albumin or Prothrombin Time). Spinal 
and general anaesthesia were used to a comparable extent in the THR and TKR studies. The proposed 
apixaban  regimen  is  applicable  for  both  types  of  anaesthesia.  Post-operative  utilization  of  NSAIDs  in 
the main studies ranged from 52% till 71% and of ASA from 5.5% till 17.6%; comparable to previous 
studies in THR and TKR.  
In  study  CV185035,  apixaban  was  administered  within  12  hours  in  around  10%  of  the  patients,  and 
within  12-24  hours  in  85%.  The  corresponding  figures  in  the  TKR  study  were  6%  and  89%.  As 
mentioned earlier, the proposed timing of administration of apixaban is more delayed compared to the 
recently approved oral anti-coagulants. This is further discussed later.  
Results 
Efficacy Results 
In both studies, apixaban resulted in significantly lower incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint (THR: 
1.39%;  TKR:  15.06%)  compared  to  enoxaparin  (THR:  3.86%  and  TKR:  24.37%)  as  shown  in  table 
(E5). In study CV185035, the upper bound of the 95% CI for RR was well below 1.25 (the NI margin 
for  the  risk  ratio);  therefore,  the  Non  Inferiority  (NI)  criterion  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was 
met. In study CV185047, the upper bound of the 95% CI for risk difference was below 5.6% (the NI 
margin  for  the  risk  difference),  and  the  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  RR  was  below  1.25  (the  NI 
margin  for  the  risk  ratio);  therefore,  the  NI  criteria  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  were  met.  The 
corresponding 1-sided p-values for both NI tests were < 0.0001 (table E5).

Intended Treatment Period - Primary Efficacy Population

Key Secondary endpoints: Also in both studies, apixaban demonstrated significantly lower incidence 
of the key secondary efficacy endpoint (Major VTE: proximal DVT, non-fatal PE and VTE-related death) 
compared  to  enoxaparin.  In  study  CV185035  (THR),  the  event  rates  were  0.45%  for  apixaban  and 
1.14% for enoxaparin (table E6). The observed RRR of apixaban vs. enoxaparin for the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint was 60%. In study CV185047, the event rates were 1.09% for apixaban and 2.17% 
for enoxaparin. The observed RRR of apixaban vs. enoxaparin for the key secondary efficacy endpoint 
was 50%. 
In  both  studies,  as  NI  for  the  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  demonstrated,  superiority  of 
apixaban vs. enoxaparin on the primary efficacy endpoint was then assessed. The upper bound of the 
2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  RR  was  <  1;  therefore,  superiority  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was 
demonstrated (table E6). 
Table E6: Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints During the Intended Treatment Period 
The NI analysis was primarily performed on the primary efficacy analysis set.  
The definition of primary efficacy data set, on which the NI analysis was based includes patients with 
protocol violations. Such analysis should have been done on the per protocol population, corresponding 
to Evaluable Subjects Data Set. However, results are presented later for both populations. 
Per protocol analysis of the primary and major secondary endpoints revealed comparable results.  
A  summary  of  individual  components  of  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  with  onset 
during the intended treatment period is tabulated in table E7.

Table E7: Summary of Some Components of Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
with Onset During the Intended Treatment Period 
Each event was only counted once per subject, but subjects could be counted in multiple categories 
* Data set = Randomized Subjects. 
** Data set = Randomized subjects with an adjudicated and evaluable bilateral venogram or an adjudicated event 
associated with the endpoint, during the Intended Treatment Period. 
*** Data set = Randomized subjects with either an adjudicated and evaluable bilateral proximal venogram or an 
adjudicated event associated with the endpoint, during the Intended Treatment Period. 
**** Data set = Randomized subjects with either an adjudicated and evaluable bilateral distal venogram or an 
adjudicated event associated with the endpoint, during the Intended Treatment Period. 
Intended Follow-up Period  
Event rates for individual efficacy endpoints were low for both apixaban and enoxaparin during this 60-
day period. In study CV185035, no subject had a PE in the apixaban group vs. 4 subjects (0.16%) in 
the enoxaparin group. There  were 2 deaths (0.08%) in apixaban and 1 death (0.04%) in enoxaparin 
group. In study CV185047, three subjects (0.21%) had a PE in the apixaban group (1 was a fatal PE) 
vs. 1 subject (0.07%) in the enoxaparin group. 
Deaths and PE 
Study  CV185035.  There were 5 deaths in the apixaban group and 2 deaths in the enoxaparin group 
during the entire study duration; the cause of death is as follows: 
Apixaban 
- Intended Treatment Period: 3 deaths (1 VTE-related, 1 due to abdominal compartment syndrome, 
and 1 due to colonic neoplasm) 
- Intended Follow-up Period: 2 deaths (1 due to ileal perforation and 1 due to pancreatic cancer) 
Enoxaparin 
- Intended Treatment Period: 1 death (fat embolism) 
- Intended Follow-up Period: 1 death (stroke). 
The number of observed PE events (fatal and non-fatal) was smaller for the apixaban group (3) than 
the enoxaparin group (9) during the Intended Treatment and Follow-up Periods.  
The  one  case  of  VTE-related  death  reported  in  the  apixaban  during  the  intended  treatment  period 
concerns  a  73  years  old  Asian  male.  The  patient  died  on  day  9  with  PE  as  the  adjudicated  cause  of 
death.  No  diagnostic  procedures  were  performed  due  to  the  rapidity  of  the  subject’s  demise.  No 
autopsy was performed. Per protocol all deaths including this one are adjudicated independently. The 
adjudication committee ruled this as a VTE-related death, since acute PE could not be excluded and the 
subject  is  included  in  the  primary  analysis.  In  the  CSR,  the  efficacy  listing  reports  the  result  of 
adjudication and therefore includes this subject as having had a VTE-related death; the listing of SAEs 
with  outcome  of  death  reports  the  SAE  that  led  to  death  per  investigator  assessment  and  therefore 
includes this subject as having had a non-VTE related cause of death. 
Study  CV185047.  There were 3 deaths in the apixaban group and 1  death in the enoxaparin group 
during the entire study duration; the cause of death is as follows: 
Page 31/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apixaban.  
-  Intended  Treatment  Period:  2  deaths  (1  VTE-related  and  1  due  to  hepatitis,  hyponatremia, 
aspiration of vomitus, and atrial fibrillation) 
- Intended Follow-up Period: 1 death (VTE-related) 
Enoxaparin. 
- Intended Treatment Period: none 
- Intended Follow-up Period: 1 death (major bleed [retroperitoneal]). 
The  number  of  observed  PE  events  (fatal  and  non-fatal)  was  higher  for  the  apixaban  group  (7)  than 
the  enoxaparin  group  (1)  for  the  Intended  Treatment  and  Follow-up  Periods.  However,  the  small 
number  of  events  does  not  allow  for  a  meaningful  assessment  of  the  effect  of  apixaban  relative  to 
enoxaparin on PE alone.  
The  one  case  of  VTE-related  death  reported  in  the  apixaban  group  during  the  intended  treatment 
period  concerns  a  64  years  old  white  female  with  history  of  ischemic  heart  disease,  congestive  heart 
failure (CHF), and hypertension. She received her first dose of apixaban the day after surgery. The day 
after, she was diagnosed with cardio-pulmonary arrest with unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
The autopsy revealed a right pulmonary artery embolism and a right lower extremity DVT. The subject 
had been fully compliant with study medication prior to the event. 
The one case of VTE-related death reported in the apixaban group during the intended follow-up period 
concerns an 85 years old white female, with PE as the adjudicated cause of death. The subject died at 
home approximately 1 month after her last dose of study medication. No autopsy was performed. 
In  the  THR  (CV185035)  study,  results  of  the  main  secondary  endpoints  are  mainly  driven  by  the 
favorable results of proximal DVT (7 vs 20 cases in the apixaban and enoxaparin respectively). There 
is  a  numerical  reduction  in  the  events  of  non-fatal  PE  (2  vs  5  in  the  apixaban  and  enoxaparin 
respectively)  but there  was  also  one  case  of  VTE-related  death  in  the  apixaban  arm.  Furthermore,  in 
the  follow-up  period,  PE  and  symptomatic  proximal  DVT  were  still  recorded  in  numerically  higher 
numbers  in  the  enoxaparin  (4  and  3  cases  respectively)  compared  to  none  in  the  apixaban  group. 
Considering  the  clinical  importance  of  these  endpoints,  the  benefit  of  apixaban  in  THR  is  considered 
demonstrated.  
In the TKR (CV185047) study, analysis of the clinically significant endpoints represented in major VTE 
confirmed apixaban superiority, with the benefit mainly driven by the lower incidence of proximal DVT 
events (0.76% and 2.17% respectively). There is a numerically higher incidence of PE in the apixaban 
group  (3  vs  0  respectively)  in  addition  to  one  VTE-related  death  versus  no  events  with  enoxaparin. 
Results of the follow-up period show one extra case of VTE-related death, 2 cases of PE and 2 cases of 
symptomatic proximal VTE, versus 0, 1 and 1 case for enoxaparin respectively. 
The duration of administration of apixaban in the TKR studies is in line with that used in other studies 
and  in  the  relevant  CHMP  guideline.  These  recommendations  are  based  on  several  clinical  reviews 
investigating the benefit/risk of extended thromboprophylaxis in different orthopedic surgeries. In one 
meta-analysis,  it  was  shown  that  patients  who  underwent  THR  tended  to  derive  greater  protection 
from  symptomatic  VTE  using  extended  thromboprophylaxis  (pooled  OR,  0.33;  95%  CI,  0.19  to  0.56; 
NNT,  62)  than  patients  who  underwent  TKR  (pooled  OR,  0.74;  95%  CI,  0.26  to  2.15;  NNT,  250). 
Accordingly,  the  ACCP  guideline  (Geerts  et  al.,  2008)  clearly  recommends  the  extension  of  
thromboprophylaxis  beyond  10  days  and  up  to  35  days  after  surgery  in  cases  of  THR  (Grade  1A). 
However  for  patients  undergoing  TKR,  the  evidence  of  recommendation  for  the  same  extended 
duration is graded 2B.  
In  study  CV185047,  an  equal  number  of  patients  (n=4)  with  PE  were  observed  during  each  of  the 
treatment  periods  and  the  follow-up  periods  (4:0  and  3:1  in  the  apixaban  and  enoxaparin  groups 
respectively).  The  figures  do  not  support  that  the  duration  of  apixaban  thromboprophylaxis  was  too 
short compared to enoxaparin. In summary, based on data from the apixaban dossier, it appears that 
the  duration  of  administration  of  apixaban  was  adequate  compared  to  enoxaparin  for  the  recruited 
patients in these studies. 
The missing or non-evaluable venograms rate recorded in the studies are on the higher limit recorded 
in  previous  studies,  but  are  within  the  assumed  rate  in  the  statistical  plan.  Missing  venograms  were 
mainly due to subject refusal, however, another category “others” accounting for 13% of the missing 
cases was observed. The most frequent reason was due to discontinuation from the study or due to a 
Page 32/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medical event (i.e. an adverse event not specified to be related to VTE, bleeding, stroke, or myocardial 
infarction). Importantly, these reasons appear balanced between the treatment groups. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoints supports the robustness of the results. However, 
for  the  superiority  of  the  secondary  endpoints,  sensitivity  analysis  is  less  robust,  which  can  be 
attributed  to  the  few  events,  as  noted  by  the  applicant.  Subgroup  analysis  generally  supported  the 
overall results. 
Supportive study 
Study  CV185034  was  the  first  conducted  phase  III  study  in  the  indication  of  VTEp  in  the  TKR.  It 
follows  the  general  design  and  endpoints  of  the  previously  presented  pivotal  studies,  but  can  be 
considered only as supportive taking into account that the comparator enoxaparin was administered in 
a different dose regimen than that employed in EU. That is a dose of 30 mg BID starting 12-24 hours 
post-surgery,  whereas  in  EU,  it  is  administered  as  40  mg  QD  with  the  first  dose  administered  before 
surgery. So actually in this study, almost double the dose of enoxaparin is administered.  
Results.  The observed event rate for the primary efficacy endpoint for apixaban 2.5 mg BID (8.99%) 
was similar to that of enoxaparin 30 mg BID (8.85%) (Table E9). The  study did not achieve the pre-
defined statistical criteria for NI based on the CI for RR  (RR = 1.02 with 95% CI of 0.78 to 1.32). The 
pre-specified NI criterion was based on meeting two conditions: (1) the upper bound of the 95% CI for 
the  RR  must  not  have  exceeded  1.25  and  (2)  the  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference 
between event rates must not have exceeded 5.6%. 
Table E9: Summary of Primary Efficacy Endpoint (Composite of All VTE/All-cause Death) 
During the Intended Treatment Period - Primary Efficacy Population 
The  applicant  attributes  this  inability  to  show  NI  of  apixaban  to  enoxaparin  to  the  unexpectedly  low 
event  rate  of  enoxaparin.  The  sample  size  of  the  study  was  based  on  an  event  rate  of  total  VTE/all 
cause  death around  16% (reported  in  the  phase  II study  CV185010 table E2),  whereas  the  currently 
reported  rate  in  the  study  was  8.85%.  The  applicant  argues  that  this  was  the  lowest  recorded  event 
rate for enoxaparin.  This argument is accepted as in the study RE.MOBILIZE comparing dabigatran to 
enoxaparin 30 mg BID, results of enoxaparin on total VTE/all cause death were reported to be 25.3%, 
were  higher  than  that  reported  in  either  TKR  studies  currently  presented.  Admittedly  the  standard  of 
care could have improved through the time, but does not account alone for such a decrease in event 
rates. 
The observed event rate for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was higher for apixaban (2.05%) 
than enoxaparin 30 mg BID (1.64%), but was not significant (p-value = 0.44)(table E10).  
Page 33/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table E10:  Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints During the Intended Treatment Period 
This difference in the event rates was driven by the difference in PEs (16 on apixaban and 7 on 
enoxaparin 30 mg BID)(table E11). 
Table E11: Summary of Individual Components of Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy 
Endpoints with Onset During the Intended Treatment Period. 
An opposite trend was observed during the 60-day Intended Follow-up Period (1 [0.06%] for apixaban 
and 5 [0.32%] for enoxaparin). 
It should be noted that these are numerical increases and should be considered with caution. Of note, 
data submitted in previous  regulatory submissions for other products, in the RE-MOBILIZE  study, the 
approved dose of dabigatran was associated with 6 cases of PE (1%) versus 0 cases for the lower dose 
and 5 cases (0.7%) with enoxaparin.  Also one case of VTE-related death was reported with dabigatran 
(0.2%) versus no cases reported with the lower dose or enoxaparin.  
The  applicant  submitted  a  thorough  analysis  investigating  the  possible  contributing  factors  to  this 
higher  incidence  of  PE  in  the  apixaban  group.  The  applicant  did  not  specifically  address  the  issue  of 
duration of hospitalization. It can be agreed with the applicant that for the investigated risk factors in 
patient  characteristics  none  can  be  identified  that  could  be  specifically  attributed  to  this  higher 
incidence of PE. The applicant did not specifically address the issue of duration of hospitalization. There 
was  a  higher  incidence  of  total  VTE  reported  in  Russia/Ukraine  which  was  attributed  to  the  longer 
hospitalization period in these countries. However, this explanation can not hold when comparing the 
hospitalization  period  between  studies  CV185047  (mean  11  days)  and  showing  a  lower  incidence  of 
VTE  events,  compared  to  study  CV185034  (mean  6  days).  So,  it  can  be  concluded  that  duration  of 
hospitalization does not per se play a major role in the incidence of VTE events.Regarding geographic 
location  and  medical  practice,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  a  higher  diagnostic  workup  in 
US/Canada may have contributed to the higher reported incidence of PE in study CV185034 as shown 
in the table below.

Assessment  of  Ascertainment  Bias  for  PE  -  Randomized  Subjects  (Pooled  CV185035, 
CV185047, CV185034 and CV185010) 
However, this can not explain the imbalance noticed between the apixaban and enoxaparin arms, as it 
is a randomized study. In addition, the applicant brought forward a hypothesis that these early cases 
of  PE  could  have  been  cases  of  fat  emboli  misdiagnosed  as  PE.  This  hypothesis  is  not  supported,  as 
these  cases  are  supposedly  adjudicated  and  the  diagnosis  is  not  solely  based  on  the  radiological 
findings.  
Deaths: There were 3 deaths in the apixaban group and 6 deaths in the enoxaparin group during the 
entire study duration; the cause of death is as follows: 
Apixaban 
- Intended Treatment Period: 3 deaths (2 VTE-related, 1 due to myocardial infarction) 
- Intended Follow-up Period: none 
Enoxaparin 
- Intended Treatment Period: 3 deaths (1 bleeding, 1 atrial fibrillation, and 1 due to unknown cause) 
- Intended Follow-up Period: 3 deaths (2 VTE-related and 1 due to myocardial infarction). 
The  first  case  of  VTE-related  death  concerns  a  65  years  old  white  female  without  history  of 
cardiovascular disease randomized to apixaban 2.5mg BID. She had no apparent VTE risk factors other 
than  the  current  orthopedic  procedure.  On  the  day  after  surgery,  three  hours  after  the  first  dose  of 
study  drug,  she  became  hypotensive,  hypoxemic  and  required  mechanical  respiratory  support.  She 
was  diagnosed  with  cardiac  arrest.  Resuscitative  measures  were  unsuccessful.  An  autopsy  was 
performed and it revealed a PE. 
The second case concerns a 66 years old white male, with PE as the adjudicated cause of death. Prior 
to the first dose of study medication, the subject became diaphoretic, short of breath, and hypotensive 
and  was  given  volume  resuscitation.  The  study  drug  was  administered  more  than  24  hours  after 
surgery.   The  PE  event  occurred the day  after  surgery  (Day  1)  and  was  confirmed by  lung  scan.  The 
patient  developed  cardiopulmonary  arrest  and  death  occurred  later  the  same  day.  No  autopsy  was 
performed.  
Two cases of death were reported with enoxaparin during the intended follow-up period.   
One subject was a 72-year-old white female randomized to enoxaparin 30 mg q12h. She had a medical 
history of hypertension and a prior cerebrovascular accident and had BMI of 36 kg/m2. On study Day 1 
(the day after surgery) she experienced hypoxemia, hypotension and respiratory difficulties leading to 
cardio-respiratory  arrest.  Blinded  study  drug  was  discontinued  after  this  SAE.  She  was  successfully 
resuscitated  but  had  multiple  complications  including  hypoxic  encephalopathy  and  urosepsis.  These 
complications led to a prolonged hospital course resulting in her death on Day 41. An autopsy was not 
done.  The  case  was  adjudicated  as  a  VTE-related  death  since  PE  could  not  be  excluded.  The  clinical 
presentation prior to death could also have been  caused by other conditions such as  fat embolism or 
cardiac arrest due to another cause. 
The  other  subject  was  a  78-year-old  white  female  without  significant  cardiovascular  disease  history. 
She experienced a cardio respiratory arrest on study Day 1 (the day after surgery). Blinded study drug 
was  discontinued  after  this  SAE.  During  the  event,  she  was  hypotensive,  hypoxemic  and  required 
endotracheal  intubation  due  to  respiratory  failure.  The  etiology  of  the  event  was  attributed  to  a  PE, 
confirmed by spiral CT scan. The subject remained hospitalized. Her clinical course was complicated by 
septic  shock,  aspiration  pneumonia,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS),  and  acute  renal 
failure  (ARF).  On  Day  21,  the  subject  had  a  second  PE  and  died  of  its  complications.  The  case  was 
adjudicated per protocol and a VTE event resulting in death was confirmed. 
Summary of main studies 
The two following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Venous  thromboembolism  VTE  is  a  common  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  following  total  hip 
replacement  or  total  knee  replacement  surgeries.  These  events,  which  include  distal  deep  venous 
thrombosis  DVT,  proximal  DVT,  clinical  pulmonary  embolism  PE,  and  fatal  PE,  occur  in  40%-80%, 
10%-20%,  4%-10%,  and  0.2%-5%  of  patients,  respectively,  when  thromboprophylaxis  is  not  used 
(Geerts et al., 2008).1 
PE  is not  the  only  serious  consequence  of DVT.  Any  episode  of DVT  significantly  increases  the  risk  of 
further  VTE,  and  may  also  lead  to  a  post-thrombotic  syndrome  that  includes  venous  ulceration, 
debilitating pain, and intractable edema. 
Most clots that cause PE originate in the large veins of the legs. This is supported by the effectiveness 
of vena cava filters in the reduction of the incidence of PE in patients who have had recurrent VTE, but 
have  contraindications  for  anticoagulation.  PE  is  difficult  to  diagnose,  expensive  to  treat,  and  often 
fatal.  Therefore,  the  prevention  of  DVT  represents  the  best  strategy  to  decrease  the  morbidity  and 
mortality of PE. 
The most effective methods for prevention of VTEp involve the use of anticoagulants in patients at risk. 
Several  of  the  clinical  situations  that  result  in  the  highest  risk  of  VTE  are  transient,  such  as  those 
associated  with  major  orthopedic  or  other  surgeries  or  hospitalization  for  acute  medical  illnesses.  For 
these  situations,  guidelines  recommend  short-term  VTE  prophylaxis  that  is  most  often  achieved  with 
parenteral anticoagulants. These agents include heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), and 
fondaparinux.  
The most commonly used agents for VTEp are still the parenteral agents. These can be associated with 
local  injection  site  hematomas.  In  addition,  heparin  and  LMWH  carry  a  low,  but  serious,  risk  of

thrombocytopenia.  By  their  very  nature,  parenteral  agents  are  less  likely  to  be  used  properly  after 
hospital  discharge  than  simple  PO  regimens.  Thus,  there  exists  an  unmet  medical  need  for  safe  and 
effective  agents  that  can  be  administered  PO.  In  the  setting  of  orthopaedic  surgery,  not  all  patients 
currently receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis because surgeons are concerned about the bleeding 
risks of available agents.  
Choice of Endpoints 
The  chosen  primary  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  studies  is  not  in  line  with  the  current  CHMP  guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/707/98  Rev.1  corr),  whereas  the  key  secondary  endpoint  is  in  fact  the  recommended 
primary  endpoint  in the CHMP  guideline.  All-cause  death  can  also  be  part  of the  primary  endpoint.  It 
should be noted that the relevant CHMP guideline has itself undergone several changes in the past few 
years.  The  last  revisions  were  meant  to  restrict  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  to  the  more  clinically 
relevant DVT that is the proximal variety only (symptomatic or asymptomatic). However, this was later 
changed  to  the  possibility  to  include  distal  symptomatic  DVT  as  well.  Thus,  whereas  the  chosen 
primary  endpoint  can  be  considered  too  liberal  as  it  includes  asymptomatic  distal  DVT,  the  chosen 
secondary  endpoint  is  conservative,  as  it  excludes  symptomatic  distal  DVT  and  asymptomatic  distal 
DVT. 
According  to  the  applicant,  aiming  to  show  non-inferiority  to  enoxaparin  based  on  the  incidence  of 
major VTE endpoint (excluding all distal DVT) would require large studies.  
Statistical methods 
In  study  CV185035,  initial  sample  size  calculations over  estimated  the  event  rates  (3.85%  and 5.5% 
for  apixaban  and  enoxaparin).  Based  on  the  results  of  the  dabigatran  studies,  these  estimations 
appeared  realistic  (event  rates  recorded  of  around  5%),  though  overestimated  compared  to 
rivaroxaban (1.1% to 3.7% respectively). A blinded event rate estimation of study CV185035 showed 
lower events rates, which necessitated increasing study sample size to provide adequate power for NI. 
This  is  accepted,  as  the  estimation  was  blinded  and  was  not  made  to  detect  efficacy.  An  estimated 
event  rate  of  around  1%  for  secondary  endpoints  appears  to  be  on  the  lower  side  (dabigatran  study 
had an event rate of around 4%, while rivaroxaban had a range from 0.2% to 2%). The justification of 
the  choice  of  the  NI  margin  for  both  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  main  secondary  endpoint  is 
acceptable clinically.  
In  study  CV185047,  sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  event  rates  reported  in  study  CV185010 
(16%  and  11  %  for  enoxaparin  and  apixaban  respectively),  which  eventually  appear  to  have  been 
under-estimated (24% and 15 % respectively). 
The  NI  margin  for  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  TKR  studies  appears  appropriate.  Setting  a  NI  with 
another  criterion  based  on  the  absolute  risk  difference  is  also  conservative  considering  the  possible 
difference  in  the  event  rates.  Calculation  of  NI  margin  of  1.5  for  the  major  secondary  endpoint  also 
appears clinically relevant and it is in line with that previously accepted for rivaroxaban. 
Efficacy  results  shown  in  the  THR  (CV185035)  study  are  mainly  driven  by  the  favorable  results  of 
clinically relevant endpoint. There is a numerical reduction in the events of non-fatal PE but there was 
also one case of VTE-related death in the apixaban arm. Furthermore, in the follow-up period PE and 
symptomatic  proximal  DVT  were  still  recorded  in  numerically  higher  number  in  the  enoxaparin 
compared to none in the apixaban group.  
Benefit  in  VTE-p  TKR  is  mainly  based  on  study  CV185047.  Analysis  of  the  clinically  significant 
endpoints represented in major VTE confirmed apixaban superiority, with the benefit mainly driven by 
the  lower  incidence  of  proximal  DVT  events  (0.76%  and  2.17%  respectively).  However,  this  was 
associated  with  more  numbers  of  PE  cases  in  the  apixaban  group  (n=4,  with  one  fatal  in  intended 
treatment  period  and  3  in  the  intended  follow-up  period)  compared  to  the  enoxaparin  group  (0  in 
intended  treatment  period  and  1  in  the  intended  follow-up  period).  Thorough  analysis  of  these  cases 
did  not  show  that  any  specific  patient  characteristic  could  have  contributed  to  this  higher  incidence. 
The  later  initiation  of  either  apixaban  or  enoxaparin  was  shown  to  be  associated  with  a  higher 
probability of total VTE, but not major VTE, but no robust conclusions can be made about the optimal 
timing of initiation; which should best be individualized. The posology also appears optimal. 
In  the  supportive  TKR  study  CV185034,  the  incidence  of  PE  was  even  higher  in  the  apixaban  group. 
The only relevant explanation given about the higher threshold of clinical suspicion in US/Canada can 
only explain the higher diagnosis of PE in this study, but can not explain the higher incidence of PE in 
the apixaban group as it is a randomized study. 
By  historical  comparisons  with  the  results  of  recently  approved  anti-coagulants,  it  could  be  observed 
that apixaban had higher incidences of PE and VT-related death. Enoxaparin on the other hand faired 
the best in the apixaban studies. This supports that these PE were chance findings.

a PE includes non-fatal PEs and VTE-related deaths (i.e., deaths for which PE is the cause, PE cannot be 
excluded as a cause, or unexplained deaths). 
b VTE-related death includes deaths for which PE is the cause, PE cannot be excluded as a cause, or 
unexplained deaths. 
Event Rates for PE and Symptomatic VTE During the Intended Treatment Period in Recent 
TKR Pivotal Trials with the EU Regimen of Enoxaparin as Comparator 
In  support  that  the  higher  PE  incidence  in  the  US  study  can  be  coincidental  is  that  there  was  no 
associated higher incidence of all DVT in the apixaban group compared to enoxaparin (7.8% vs 8.2% 
respectively). Also the incidence of PE in the enoxaparin arm in the US study was higher (n=7; 0.44 %) 
than  that  in  the  EU  study  (0).  In  summary,  apixaban  results  in  VTE-related  deaths  in  TKR  are 
numerically  higher  compared  historically  to  other  anti-coagulants,  whereas  the  results  of  enoxaparin 
are comparatively better.  
Patient population 
The  pivotal  studies  excluded  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment;  this  limited  clinical  experience  is 
reflected in the SmPC. Based on PK data, the expected increase in exposure is not associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding.  
Page 43/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The excluded patients in the VTEp clinical program (patients with ALT/AST > 2x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 
1.5  x  ULN)  are  reflected  in  the  SmPC  and  eliquis  should  be  used  with  caution  in  this  population 
together with the need to measure ALT before apixaban administration. 
Time of administration 
Timing  of  initiation  of  apixaban  administration  which  is  more  delayed  compared  to  other  oral  agents 
was further investigated. Using a cut off of 18 hours from surgery, results show that the incidence rate 
of  major  VTE/all  cause  death  is  slightly  lower  in  patients  administered  apixaban  less  than  18  hours 
after  surgery  (1.07%)  compared  to  those  administered  apixaban  more  than  18  hours  after  surgery 
(1.21%).  This  difference  is  even  more  marked  in  the  enoxaparin  group  (0.91%  vs  2.65%)  and  even 
more  exaggerated  if  incidence  of  all  VTE  is  considered.  Based  on  another  analytical  approach,  it  is 
shown that time from surgery to dose of apixaban was a significant independent predictor of the risk 
for All VTE and that for every additional hour from surgery to dose the odds of having All VTE increase 
by  a  factor  of  1.027.  This  argues  on  one  hand  for  the  early  use  of  the  anticoagulant.  On  the  other 
hand, the same analysis also showed that time from surgery to dose was not a significant predictor of 
the  risk  for  major  VTE/all-cause  death  which  is  the  most  relevant  endpoint.  This  analysis  applies  for 
both apixaban and enoxaparin, therefore, can not explain the observed imbalance in PE. In the current 
ACCP  guideline  (Geerts  et  al.,  2008),  the  advantages  of  pre-operative  initiation  of  anti-coagulant 
therapy is even debated (current EU enoxaparin regimen). The applicant submitted further analysis of 
the  VTE  events  in  patients  administered  apixaban  earlier  than  12  hours  after  surgery.  However,  the 
numbers of these patients are too limited to draw any conclusions. Overall, these results support the 
general  recommendations  of  initiating  apixaban  12-24  hours  after  surgery.  However  considering  the 
wide  time  frame  of  12-24  hours  and  the  potential  impact  between  the  benefits  of  delayed  initiation 
(less bleeding) and the risks (thrombosis), it is considered useful to alert the physicians that the exact 
time of initiation should be individualized. This is implemented in the SmPC.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  benefit  of  apixaban  in  VTEp  in  patients  undergoing  THR  and  TKR  is  considered  acceptable.  No 
explanation  can  be  given  for  the  higher  incidence  of  PE  reported  in  the  TKR  studies,  even  after 
thorough  analysis  of  possible  patient  characteristics  or  posology  that  could  have  contributed  to  this 
observation.  Based  on  the  current  data  analysis  and  compared  to  results  of  other  anti-coagulants,  it 
can  be  concluded  that  these  PE  were  probably  chance  finding  and  they  are  mentioned  in  the  SmPC 
section. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Available safety information related to apixaban 2.5 mg BID in the indication of VTEp is based mainly 
on  studies  CV185035,  CV185047,  CV185034  and  CV185010  (VTEp).  Reference  will  also  be  made  in 
certain  sections  to  the  available  safety  data  from  apixaban  investigated  in  other  indications  (VTE 
treatment,  secondary  prevention  in  ACS,  VTEp  in  metastatic  cancer  patients  and  AF).    Exposure  of 
patients  in  the  ongoing  studies  CV185030,  CV185048  and  CV185036  is  14,456  (apixaban/warfarin), 
4,592 (apixaban/aspirin) and 3382 (apixaban/enoxaparin) in the indications stroke-p in AF for the first 
2 studies and VTEp in medically ill subjects  in the third study respectively is high. Although this can 
add valuable safety information, its value is limited as the data is blinded. 
Patient exposure 
The total number of subjects who received at least one dose of any double-blind study drug in the four 
VTEp  studies  was  12,742.  Of  these,  11,828  subjects  received  apixaban  2.5  mg  BID  (5,924)  or 
enoxaparin 40 mg QD (4,167) or enoxaparin 30 mg BID (1,737). This exposure is considered adequate 
to characterize the safety profile of apixaban in this indication. The extent of exposure was similar in 
the apixaban and enoxaparin groups, both in the overall population and within subgroups. There were 
no treatment differences judged to be clinically relevant to the safety comparisons. 
The duration of exposure was bimodal due to the different target treatment durations by operative site 
(12 days for TKR and 35 days for THR). Approximately half of the subjects (46%) received study drug 
for 10 to 14 days, as per protocol for the 12-day studies in TKR, while 38% received study drug for 32 
to 38 days, as per protocol for the 35-day study in THR. 
Pooled data for all 4 studies, as well as for the pivotal studies is presented. Pooling of the 4 studies is 
considered acceptable considering that the same dose of apixaban was used. However, for comparative 
purposes  with  enoxaparin,  such  pooling  may  not  always  be  appropriate  considering  that  in  the  two 
Page 44/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pivotal studies, enoxaparin was administered as 40 mg QD, and as 30 mg BID in the other studies. For 
brevity, only selected data will be presented. 
Adverse events  
In the four pooled VTEp studies, the frequency of common AEs (reported for > 1% of subjects in either 
treatment  group)  was  similar  in  the  apixaban  and  enoxaparin  groups  (apixaban  3812  [64%], 
enoxaparin 3936 [66.7%]) (Table S3). AEs reported for > 5% of subjects in the apixaban group were 
nausea  (13.9%  vs  15.5%),  constipation  (10.7%  vs  12%),  pyrexia  (7.9%  vs  8.2%),  procedural  pain 
(7.8% vs 8.1%), vomiting (6.7% vs 7.9%), peripheral edema (6.3% vs 6.5%), hypotension (5.7% for 
both), and dizziness (5.4% vs 4.7%) reported in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups respectively. The 
overall  frequency  of  common  AEs  with  onset  during  the  follow-up  period  was  similar  in  the  apixaban 
and enoxaparin groups (897 [15.5%] and 913 [15.9%], respectively) in the 4 pooled studies, as well 
as in the 2 pivotal studies (apixaban 485 [12.0%], enoxaparin 492 [12.2%]). 
Treatment-related  adverse  events  TRAEs: In the four pooled VTEp studies, the overall frequency 
of  drug-related  AEs  TRAEs  with  onset  during  the  treatment  period  was  similar  for  the  apixaban  and 
enoxaparin  groups  (1051  [17.7%]  and  1122  [19.0%],  respectively)  (table  S3).  The  following  drug-
related  AEs  were  reported  for  >  1%  of  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups:  nausea,  DVT,  peripheral 
edema, pyrexia, contusion, and post-operative anemia. 
Table  S3:  Summary  of  Related  Adverse  Events  with  Onset  During  the  Treatment  Period  - 
Treated Subjects (Pooled CV185010, CV185034, CV185035 and CV185047) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious  Adverse  Events: The overall frequency of SAEs with onset during the treatment period and 
the follow-up period in the four pooled VTEp studies was similar in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups 
(392  [6.6%]  and  396  [6.7%],  respectively  in  the  treatment  period  and  in  the  follow-up  period:  46 
[0.8%]  and 49  [0.9%])  respectively).  No  SAE  was  reported  for  >  1%  of  subjects  in  either  treatment 
group. 
During  the  treatment  period,  event  numbers  and  rates  of  SAEs  of  DVT  and  PE  in  the  apixaban  vs. 
enoxaparin groups in each of the individual studies were as follows: 
-  CV185035: DVT 8 (0.3%) vs. 18 (0.7%); PE 3 (0.1%) vs. 7 (0.3%) 
-  CV185047: DVT 11 (0.7%) vs. 22 (1.5%); PE 5 (0.3%) vs. 1 (< 0.1%) 
-  CV185034: DVT 6 (0.4%) vs. 10 (0.6%); PE 19 (1.2%) vs. 9 (0.6%) 
-  CV185010: DVT 3 (1.9%) vs. 3 (2.0%); PE 2 (1.3%) vs. 2 (1.3%). 
During  the  follow-up  period,  serious  events  of  DVT  and  PE  were  reported  for  2  (<  0.1%)  subjects  in 
the apixaban group and 8 [0.1%] subjects in the enoxaparin group. SAEs of DVT with onset during the 
follow-up period were reported for none of the subjects in the apixaban group and 5 (< 0.1%) subjects 
in  the  enoxaparin  group.  SAEs  of  PE  with  onset  during  the  follow-up  period  were  reported  for  2  (< 
0.1%) subjects in the apixaban group and 3 (< 0.1%) subjects in the enoxaparin group. 
These SAE are previously discussed under efficacy. 
Deaths:  Overall  event  rates  for  deaths  in  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  four  studies  were  low  in  both 
treatment  groups  with  only  numerical  differences  between  treatment  groups  during  the  treatment 
period  (apixaban  10/5924  [0.17%],  enoxaparin  7/5904  [0.12%]).  The  event  rates  for  death  in  the 
Page 45/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
apixaban group are consistent with rates reported during the treatment period in published reports of 
enoxaparin-controlled joint replacement studies (ranging from 0 to 0.3%).   
SAEs of PE with the outcome of death were reported by the investigators for 5 (0.08%) subjects in 
the  apixaban  group  and  1  (0.02%)  subject  in  the  enoxaparin  group  (table  S4).  Of  these  deaths,  4 
events  in  the  apixaban  group  and  1  event  in  the  enoxaparin  group  were  confirmed  by  adjudication. 
These events are tabulated in table S4, but were earlier discussed under efficacy. 
Table S4: Subjects with Serious Adverse Events of Pulmonary Embolism with the Outcome of 
Death During the Treatment Period (CV185035, CV185047, CV185034, and CV185010) 
Death related to other causes. Eleven subjects (apixaban 5, enoxaparin 6) had non-VTE related 
SAEs with the outcome of death with onset during the treatment period (Table S5).

Page 47/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the follow-up period, SAEs with the outcome of death with onset during the follow-up period 
were reported for 3 (0.05%) subjects in the apixaban group, and 2 (0.03%) subjects in the enoxaparin 
group (table S6).  
Table S6: Subjects with Serious Adverse Events with the Outcome of Death During the 
Follow-up Period (CV185035, CV185047, CV185034, and CV185010) 
For other causes of death, the rate appears comparable between the treatment groups. Of these cases, 
2  cases  are  considered  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  the  benefit  risk  of  apixaban.  This  includes  one 
case  of  hepatitis,  discussed  below.  The  other  2  cases  occurred  in  the  enoxaparin  group  secondary  to 
bleeding.  The  first  case  concerns  a  case  of  intracranial  hemorrhage  reported  during  the  treatment 
period (TKR study: CV185034), the other concerns a case of retroperitoneal bleeding observed during 
the follow-up period (TKR study: CV185047).

Other Significant Adverse Events. Bleeding 
Bleeding was the primary safety endpoint in all four VTEp studies and includes: 
-  adjudicated  major  bleeding  (adapted  from  International  Society  on  Thrombosis  and  Hemostasis 
[ISTH] guidelines) 
-  composite  of  adjudicated  major  bleeding  (per  ISTH  guidelines)  and  clinically  relevant  non-major 
CRNM bleeding 
- all bleeding endpoints (adjudicated or reported by the investigator). 
All  acute  clinically  overt  bleeding  events  were  submitted  for  adjudication  by  an  independent,  expert 
panel  of  physicians.  Bleeding  endpoints  were  the  same  for  all  three  Phase  3  studies  and  defined  as 
follows: 
The definition of major bleeding is acceptable. The following table (S7) summarizes the bleeding 
endpoints during the treatment period of the 3 phase III studies.  
Page 49/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Table  S7:  Summary  of  Bleeding  Endpoints  During  the  Treatment  Period  -  Treated  Subjects 
(CV185035, CV185047 and CV185034) 
No  major  bleeding  events  occurred  in  the  apixaban  2.5  mg  BID  group  or  enoxaparin  group  in  the 
Phase 2 study CV185010. 
There  was  a  comparable  risk  of  bleeding  during  both  the  treatment  and  follow-up  periods  in  the  two 
pivotal  studies  CV185035/  CV185047  between  apixaban  and  enoxaparin  administered  in  the  lower 
dose  of  40  mg  QD.  Regarding  major  bleeding,  in  the  THR  study,  major  bleeding  events  were  slightly 
higher  in  the  apixaban  group  (0.82%)  than  the  enoxaparin  group  (0.68%),  in  the  TKR  study,  the 
opposite trend was observed (apixaban 0.6% and enoxaparin 0.98%).  
In study CV185034, in which enoxaparin was administered as 30 mg BID, the rates of major bleeding 
and  the  rates  of  the  composite  endpoint  of  major  plus  clinically  relevant  non-major  bleeding  were 
lower for apixaban than enoxaparin. For the major bleeding endpoint the 95% CI for the difference in 
event rates is <0 but the p-value is > 5%. This is due to the fact that different statistics were used to 
calculate the 95% CI and the p-value. The Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by type of surgery was used 
to  calculate  the  p-value.  The  inverse  variance  or  harmonic  means  method  was  used  to  calculate  the 
95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  event  rates.  These  methods  were  pre-specified  in  the  statistical 
methodology section. 
Two  fatal  bleeding  cases  were  reported  in  the  enoxaparin  group  as  discussed  above.  The  bleeding 
profile of apixaban appears to be better compared to enoxaparin in the TKR studies. Analysis of causes 
of  major  bleeding  in  the  three  main  studies  revealed  that  most  of  the  cases  could  be  attributed  to 
decrease in haemoglobin and transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells. Importantly bleeding 
hemarthrosis  in  operated  joint  resulting  in  re-operation  or  intervention  was  a  rare  event,  with 
comparable incidence between apixaban and enoxaparin.  
There  is  no  general  need  to  monitor apixaban.  Routine  monitoring is  not  considered  feasible  because 
both the efficacy and bleeding response curves are shallow across the range of exposures following 2.5 
mg  BID  dosing.  In  addition,  only  one  dose  was  investigated  in  the  clinical  studies  and  no  dose 
adjustments are currently recommended in case of higher exposures. In cases of suspected overdose

or emergency surgery the commercially available Rotachrom anti-FXa assay may be useful to monitor 
bleeding.  
During  the  assessment  preliminary  safety  information  of  the  Appraise  II  study  was  submitted. 
Clarification  of  the  relevance  of  the  safety  bleeding  events  in  Appraise  II  to  the  currently  proposed 
indications was requested. 
APPRAISE  II  was  designed  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Apixaban  5  mg  BID  compared  to 
placebo  in  patients  with  Acute  Coronary  Syndrome  (ACS).  Most  patients  (~80%)  were  administered 
apixaban on top of both ASA and clopidogrel. The study was prematurely stopped because of a higher 
bleeding risk observed in the Apixaban arm compared to the placebo arm (any bleeding of 17.4% vs. 
7.6%). 
The  bleeding  risk  difference  was  less  noticeable  in  patients  administered  mono-antiplatelet  therapy 
(9.7%  vs  4.8%)  and  more  in  patients  on  dual  anti-platelet  therapy  (19.4%  vs.  9.3%).  The  additive 
effect of the three different agents on the bleeding risk is anticipated, but the exaggerated differences 
compared  to  the  placebo  support  the  decision  to  stop  the  study,  especially  because  apixaban  would 
usually be prescribed on top of the other agents in the ACS indication.  
The  submitted  preliminary  data  identified  three  factors  that  in  particular  increase  this  bleeding  risk: 
age  of  the  subjects  (>65  years),  creatinine  clearance  (CrCL)  at  baseline  (<  60  ml/min),  and  type  of 
antiplatelet therapy.  
It can be agreed with the applicant that the general results of APPRAISE 2 may not be directly relevant 
to the currently  assessed application for VTEp,  considering the doses used (5 mg BID vs 2.5 mg BID 
respectively). Also dual anti-platelet therapy administration is not expected to be as extensive, in the 
current indication.  
However,  particularly  relevant  to  the  VTEp  indication  are  the  patients  administered  apixaban  2.5  mg 
BID because of reduced renal impairment (Cr CL < 40 ml/min). The presented analysis included Cr Cl 
with a cut-off <60 ml/min as a risk factor for increased bleeding; it is not clear in how many of these 
patients  dose  reductions  were  implemented  and  whether  this  had  actually  minimized  the  risk  of 
bleeding. For clarity, only patients administered 2.5 mg BID are relevant to the current indication; for 
the  group  with  identified  higher  risk=  Cr  Cl  <60  ml/min  and  those  with  Cr  Cl  between  40-60  ml/min 
did not have dose reductions and accordingly not directly relevant to the VTEp indication. However, the 
clinical experience in the VTEp studies in patients with severe renal impairment is limited. 
In  addition,  as  there  is  a  much  higher  bleeding  risk  in  patients  >65  years  administered  apixaban 
(20.7% vs 9.6% in placebo), it could have been informative to know if there was an associated renal 
impairment  in  these  patients  and  if  dose  reductions  were  accordingly  implemented.  This  analysis  is 
recommended when final results of the APPRAISE II study will be submitted.  
Current  results  from  this  application  indicate  that  elderly  patients  are  a  particularly  high  risk 
subpopulation, although it should be emphasized that this risk is mostly shown when co-administered 
with other anti-platelet agents. This high risk population is reflected in the current SMPC.  
It can be agreed with the applicant that monitoring anti-Xa activity would not have helped prevent the 
bleeding events in the study as this bleeding risk is a pharmacodynamic interaction; anti-Xa activity is 
not expected to be increased or to be able to predict a higher risk. 
AEs of special Interest: Liver safety, MI, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic AEs. 
Liver Safety. Thirteen cases of concurrent elevations of ALT > 3 x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) and total 
bilirubin  >  2  x  ULN  are  reported  in  the  4  placebo-controlled  studies.  Of  the  8  cases  reported  with 
apixaban,  causality  was  assessed  as  possible  only  in  2  cases  (in  another  case,  causality  is  not 
available).  In  two  cases  (including  the  one  with  causality  not  available)  treatment  was  continued.  In 
the third case, the outcome was fatal. The causality of the drug in this fatal case is possible, but the 
contribution of other concomitantly administered drugs can not be excluded.  
In the 5 patients with reported SAE related to LFT, 4 were reported with apixaban, of which 3 causality 
is assessed as possible. One is the case of death reported above. In the second case, already an SAE 
of Grade II elevation of liver enzymes was reported prior to apixaban administration and no treatment 
was required. This precludes a firm conclusion regarding the relationship between further elevation of 
LFT  and  apixaban  administration.  The  LFT  elevations  were  reversible.  In  the  third  case,  the  possible 
cause of the LFT elevation is not clear; the causation by apixaban can not be excluded either. However, 
there  was  no  concomitant  bilirubin  elevation;  apixaban  was  not  discontinued  and  the  case  was 
reversible without treatment.  
Hepatic  safety  data  from  4  completed  clinical  studies  in  other  indications  (n=2547)  showed  a  single 
case of concurrent elevations of ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN reported with apixaban 20 
mg  QD  group  in  study  CV185027.  This  subject  had  underlying  pancreatic  cancer  and  a  stent  in  the 
Page 51/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
common bile duct developed severe bacteremia leading to treatment interruption. Later apixaban was 
restarted and LFT decreased to within normal ranges while the subject was still on study drug. 
Blinded  data  from  ongoing  studies  were  also  submitted  (14,456  subjects  have  received  apixaban  2.5 
mg BID or warfarin for a mean of 41.3 weeks and 4,592 subjects received blinded apixaban 5 mg BID 
or  aspirin  for  a  mean  of  31.4  weeks).  Although  of  limited  value  as  data  is  blinded  the  large  patient 
exposure may still help in identifying potential toxicity.  
AT  >3xULN  plus  BRB  >  2xULN:  Apixaban  0.31%  (13  of  4136)  vs.  Enoxaparin  0.12%  (5  of 
BRB > 2xULN: Apixaban 1.02% (42 of 4136) vs. Enoxaparin 0.51% (21 of 4126); RR = 2.00 
Concerns  were  raised  regarding  an  apparent  imbalance  in  the  pooled  results  of  the  European  studies 
ADVANCE-2  and  ADVANCE-3  for  total  bilirubin  BRB  >  2xULN  and  also  for  the  combination  of  AT 
>3xULN plus BRB > 2xULN (data based on the published clinical studies): 
• 
(95%CI: 1.19 to 3.35).  
• 
4126); RR = 2.59 (95%CI: 0.96 to 6.98). 
The North-American ADVANCE-1  study showed the opposite trend in favour of apixaban. Only pooled 
data on AT >3xULN plus BRB > 2xULN were submitted without any discussion on the different rate of 
bilirubin  elevations  in  the  European  and  North-American  studies.  The  main  problem  of  pooling  the 
safety data is that one can fail to detect heterogeneity in clinically important events between different 
trials that could be of clinical relevance.  
Clarification  regarding  this  heterogeneity  between  the  European  studies  (2-fold  increase  in  bilirubin 
elevations x2ULN) and the North-American study (no increase) was further requested with clarification 
regarding  baseline  characteristics  (i.e.:  age,  gender,  race,  renal  or  hepatic  function)  or  pattern  of 
concomitant medications or surgical/anaesthetic procedures that could explain the apparent higher risk 
of  bilirubin  elevations  with  apixaban  in  the  European  studies  ADVANCE-2  and  3  compared  with  the 
North-American study ADVANCE-1.  
The submitted analysis shows that the observed imbalance was mainly an artifact due to the counting 
of cases of elevated LFT even before apixaban was administered. 
Regarding the hepatotoxic potential of apixaban, the Hy’s law which is the most acceptable method to 
identify drug induced liver damage was used. This identifies three criteria: a 3 fold or greater increase 
in  ALT/AST  compared  to  control  drug  or  placebo,  accompanied  with  elevations  in  TOTAL  BRB  to 
>2xULN, without initial findings of cholestasis and after excluding other causes that could increase LFT. 
Based  on  these  criteria,  it  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  no  imbalance  between  apixaban  and 
enoxaparin  in  the  EU  or  the  North  American  studies,  during  the  post-surgery  period  and  follow-up 
period: 3 vs 4 cases and 1 vs 1 respectively, whereas in the North American study, only one case was 
reported with enoxaparin. 
Additionally,  applying  Hy’s  law  to  clinical  studies  conducted  with  apixaban  in  other  indications: 
CV185048  (exposure  ~  2700  patients  to  apixaban)  and  CV185023  (exposure  ~  1000  patients  to 
apixaban),  point  to  the  same  conclusions.  In  conclusion,  it  is  considered  that  the  above  data  do  not 
support a hepatotoxic potential for apixaban. 
Upon  CHMP  request,  the  applicant  submitted  also  the  narrative  of  the  case:  CV185030-836-9443, 
which  is  still  blinded  and  no  conclusions  can  be  inferred.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  submit  the 
information  on  the  study  medication  of  this  patient  as  soon  as  it  becomes  available.  (see  letter  of 
Undertaking). 
Based on the above, the SmPC clearly identifies the limitations of the clinical studies and the recruited 
populations. As requested by the CHMP, the applicant included “transient elevation of liver tests” as an 
Identified Risk in the RMP, and will closely monitor “hepatotoxicity” in the post marketing period.  
Regarding  the  risk  of  rebound  thrombosis,  during  the  treatment  period,  the  incidence  of  MI  appears 
balanced in the studies between the treatment groups. However, specifically in study CV185035, more 
cases of MI were observed in the apixaban group compared to enoxaparin during the treatment period 
(5 vs 3) and follow-up period (4 vs 1). However, there is no increase in MI during the Follow-up Period 
as  compared  to  the  Treatment  Period  for  apixaban  in  this  study  CV185035  (4  MI  and  5  MIs 
respectively)  or  in  the  combined  CV185035,  CV185047,  CV185034  studies  (7  MIs  in  the  Treatment 
Period vs 5 in the Follow-up). The absence of an increase in MI during the Follow-up Period (which is a 
longer  observation  period)  indicates  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  either  a  rebound  effect  of 
anticoagulant  discontinuation  or  the  removal  of  effective  antithrombotic  therapy  during  a  persisting 
sate  of  hypercoagulability.  Accordingly,  this  is  probably  a  chance  finding.  Results  of  Study  CV185023 
(a phase II study in patients with ACS) also provide reassuring data, as apixaban was even shown to 
reduce the risk of coronary artery thrombotic events. 
The risk of stroke or thrombocytopenia appears comparable between apixaban and enoxaparin.

Neurologic AEs  
Clinical neurological events became events of interest for apixaban after SAE reports were received for 
1  case  of  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (ALS)  and  1  case  of  Guillain-Barre  syndrome  (GBS)  in  the 
apixaban arm in a Phase 2 study for VTE prevention. Since then additional four cases of GBS and two 
cases  of  ALS  have  been  reported  in  the  programme  with  an  exposure  amounting  to  around  50,000 
patients (apixaban/placebo/comparator). All cases of ALS had disease onset before starting study drug. 
Although  the  causality  of  apixaban  to  the  reported  cases  of  GBS  and  ALS  did  not  appear  likely 
(assessment  confirmed  by  external  neurology  consultants),  applicant  was  requested  to  unblind  the 
cases  reported  with  GBS  or  ALS  in  the  ongoing  development  program  of  apixaban  to  allow  adequate 
assessment of the benefit-risk balance.  
The  cases  of  GBS  and  ALS  were  distributed  in  both  arms;  there  is  no  class  alert  or  structural 
association between Factor Xa inhibitors and neurological disorders; the preclinical safety assessment 
did  not  show  any  evidence  of  toxicity  in  central  or  peripheral  nervous  system;  therefore  there  is  no 
evidence that these cases are associated to the study treatment and the cases more likely occurred at 
random. All the same, enhanced surveillance is ongoing across the Phase 3 apixaban clinical program 
for neurological adverse events, and the applicant will have to provide cumulative reviews of GBS and 
ALS cases in PSURs. 
Safety in special populations 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  noted  in  the  event  rates  for  bleeding  between  apixaban  and 
enoxaparin  groups  within  subgroups  in  the  2  pivotal  studies.  Neither  intrinsic  factors  (age,  gender, 
weight, BMI, level of renal impairment, number of risk factors for VTE, or type of surgery [unilateral or 
bilateral  THR  or  TKR]),  nor  extrinsic  factors  (geographic  region)  appeared  to  have  an  impact  on  the 
bleeding profile of apixaban relative to enoxaparin observed overall in these studies.  
Results from studies in other indications (study CV185068 in ACS) showed an increased bleeding risk 
in patients co-administered apixaban, ASA and clopidogrel. This risk was more in elderly patients >65 
years and patients with CrCL> 60 ml/min. Most of the recruited patients were White (~86%) or Asian 
(~10%).  Additional  discussion  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  in  different  races  groups  was  provided  and  
did not raise any concerns. However since this is limited information from other ethnic groups (black ~ 
2%); no firm conclusions about efficacy and safety in these groups can be drawn.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Post-operative  utilization  of  NSAIDs  in  the  main  studies  ranged  from  52%  till  71%  and  of  ASA  from 
5.5%  till  17.6%,  comparable  to  previous  studies  in  THR  and  TKR.  Results  suggest  a  comparable 
bleeding  risk  of  co-administration  of  apixaban  compared  to  enoxaparin,  sometimes  even  more 
favourable. Regarding the combined administration of aspirin, clopidogrel and apixaban, the available 
PK  data  did  not  show  a  relevant  increase  in  template  bleeding  time,  platelet  aggregation,  or  clotting 
tests  (PT,  INR,  and  aPTT)  compared  to  administration  of  these  antiplatelet  agents  without  apixaban. 
However, results from clinical experience in  phase II and III studies in ACS patientsshow that a higher 
bleeding  risk  in  such  patients  can  not  be  excluded.  The  use  of  apixaban  also  is  not  recommended  in 
patients  receiving  concomittant  systemic  treatment  with  strong  inhibitors  of  both  CYP3A4  and  P-gp. 
These interactions are reported in the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs from the clinical studies was comparable between the treatment 
groups  in  the  4  studies  (apixaban  200  [3.4%],  enoxaparin  217  [3.7%]).  DVT  (apixaban  20  [0.3%], 
enoxaparin 25 [0.4%]) and PE (apixaban 23 [0.4%], enoxaparin 14 [0.2%]) were the most common 
AEs leading to discontinuation.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure  is  considered  adequate  to  characterize  the  safety  profile  of  apixaban  in  this  indication 
(n=5,924). The duration of exposure is also in line with the specified guidelines.  
Overall,  results  indicate  that  the  adverse  events  and  the  treatment  related  adverse  events  profile  of 
apixaban are comparable to that of enoxaparin.   
The overall frequency of serious adverse events with onset during the treatment period and the follow-
up period in the four pooled VTEp studies was similar in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups. No SAE 
was  reported  for  >  1%  of  subjects  in  either  treatment  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  in 
both groups were DVT and PE, which are further discussed under efficacy. 
Overall  event  rates  for  deaths  were  low  in  both  treatment  groups  with  only  numerical  differences 
between  treatment  groups  during  the  treatment  period.  The  event  rates  for  death  in  the  apixaban 
group  are  consistent  with  rates  reported  during  the  treatment  period  in  published  reports  of 
enoxaparin-controlled joint replacement studies (ranging from 0 to 0.3%).   
Adjudicated cases of PE and fatal PE are discussed under efficacy. Death related to other causes  with 
onset  during  the  treatment  period  or  the  follow-up  periods  was  reported  in  comparable  distribution 
between apixaban and enoxaparin groups.  
The bleeding profile of apixaban in both THR and TKR is considered acceptable. There was a numerical 
increase  in  major  bleeding  in  the  apixaban  arm  in  the  THR  and  the  opposite  trend  in  the  TKR  study. 
Compared  to  the  higher  dose  of enoxaparin,  a  trend  of  lower  risk  of  major  bleeding  was  observed  in 
favor  of  apixaban  and  a  significant  reduction  in the  risk  of the  composite  of major/(clinically  relevant 
non major (CRNM) bleeding. Two fatal bleeding cases were reported in the enoxaparin group.  
Current clinical data do not support a hepatotoxic potential of apixaban. There is numerical increase of 
LFT compared to enoxaparin, and causality was assessed as possible in 2 cases, one of them was fatal. 
The  causality  of  the  drug  in  this  fatal  case  is  possible,  but  the  contribution  of  other  concomitantly 
administered  drugs  can  not  be  excluded.  Data  from  4  completed  clinical  studies  in  other  indications 
(n=2547) revealed another case of elevated LFT, which could be confounded by multiple co-morbidities. 
Blinded data from ongoing studies suggest that apixaban is unlikely to be hepatotoxic. Clarification was 
provided  regarding  imbalance  between  EU  and  US  studies  which  did  not  support  a  hepatotoxic 
potential for apixaban at present. The SmPC clearly identifies the limitations of the clinical studies and 
the recruited populations. Furthermore, “Transient elevation of liver tests” are included as an Identified 
Risk in the RMP and “hepatotoxicity” will be closely monitored in the post marketing period.  
No clinically meaningful differences were noted in the frequencies of clinical laboratory test results for 
the apixaban and enoxaparin groups in any of the analysis periods. 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  noted  in  the  event  rates  for  bleeding  between  apixaban  and 
enoxaparin groups within patients subgroups. There is limited experience in patients with severe renal 
impairment which is reflected in the SmPC. Analysis based on different degrees of hepatic impairment 
is  not  submitted  as  some  parameters  of  the  Child-Pugh  scale  were  not  measured  as  baseline.  A 
cautionary  remark  is  included  about  the  exclusion  of  patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes,  and  the 
need  to  perform  ALT  prior  to  administration  for  adequate  risk  management.  Based  on  PK  data, 
bleeding  parameters  appear  not  be  significantly  affected  in  patients  concomitantly  administered 
apixaban  and  other  drugs  especially  platelet  aggregation  inhibitors  and  NSAIDs.  However,  clinical 
experience is different and is reflected in the SmPC.   
Preliminary  results  from  study  CV185048  (stroke  prevention  in  AF  patients)  which  was  prematurely 
discontinued because of efficacy were submitted upon CHMP request. The event rates for bleeding are 
higher for apixaban than ASA but these are based on a pool analysis of mixed doses of apixiban (5 mg 
BID and 2.5BID) and ASA (81, 162, 243 or 324 mg QD).  
Additional  information  received  from  cases  of  GBS  and  ALS  did  not  show  evidence  of  neurotoxicity 
since they were equally distributed in both arms and additional predisposing risk factors for GBS/ALS in 
the  underlying  medical/surgical  conditions  were  present.  There  is  no  class  alert  or  structural 
association  between  Factor  Xa  inhibitors  and  neurological  disorders  and  the  preclinical  safety 
assessment did not show any evidence of central or peripheral neurotoxicity.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety  profile  of  apixaban  in  VTE-p  in  THR  and TKR appears  to  be comparable  to that  of  enoxaparin, 
with a bleeding profile that appears favourable compared to the higher dose of enoxaparin. 
The most frequent observed adverse reactions are anaemia, haemorrhage, nausea and contusion. 
Based  on  the  current  clinical  and  pre-clinical  data,  the  hepatotoxic  potential  of  apixaban  is  not 
supported. Because “Transient elevation of liver tests” were reported, this is included as an Identified 
Risk in the RMP and “hepatotoxicity” will be closely monitored in the post marketing period.  
The SmPC clearly identifies the limitations of the clinical studies and the recruited populations: 
ELIQUIS is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically 
relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). 
It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2). 
It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or 
B). No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 
4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  (ALT/AST >2 x ULN)  or  total  bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN  were  excluded 
in clinical trials. Therefore Eliquis should be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). ALT should be measured as part of the standard pre-operative evaluation (see section 4.4). 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  applicant  has  provided  documents  that  set  out  a  detailed  description  of  the  system  of 
pharmacovigilance.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  Applicant  has  the  services  of  a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the European Union or in a third country.

Five cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) were reported. The assessment of these cases concluded 
that  they  were  not  related  to  the  given  medication.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  closely  monitor 
cases of GBS in the PSURs.  
Safety Specification 
Non-clinical and clinical safety specifications 
Nonclinical  toxicity  studies  demonstrated  no  consistent  adverse  findings  across  species.  Moreover,  no 
safety  concerns  for  apixaban  were  identified  in  safety  pharmacology  assessments  of  cardiovascular, 
neurological,  or  respiratory  functions,  and  apixaban  was  not  phototoxic  in  vitro.  Apixaban  was  not 
genotoxic in vitro or in vivo and did not impair fertility or early embryonic developments in rats directly 
dosed with apixaban. 
Identified  clinical  safety  specifications  consist  of  the  risk  of  bleeding  and  the  risk  of  interactions 
between  apixaban  and  various  CYP  3A4  and  P-gp  inhibitors.  Potential  clinical  safety  specifications 
consist  of  the  risk  of  transient  elevation  of  liver  tests,  risk  of  interactions  between  apixaban  and 
antiplatelet and anticoagulants, risk of off-label use, misuse and overdose. 
Several  issues  were  identified  as  important  missing  information:  subpopulations  in  paediatrics; 
pregnancy  and/or  lactating  women;  severe  hepatic  or  renal  impairment populations;  and  hip fracture 
surgery or other non elective orthopedic procedures. 
Pharmacovigilance Plan 
The  applicant  will  undertake  continuous  monitoring  for  safety  signals  and  proposes  routine  and 
enhanced  pharmacovigilance  practices.  The  risk  on  bleeding,  interactions,  transient  elevation  of  liver 
tests,  on  overdose,  and  the  missing  information  concerning  paediatrics,  pregnancy,  patients  with 
severe  hepatic  or  renal  impairment  are  considered  covered  by  the  proposed  SmPC  in  the  respective 
sections.  
The Applicant states that additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned which include: 
 


2.8.  BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
In Total Hip Replacement (THR) study  (CV185035), apixaban demonstrated a significant superiority to 
enoxaparin for the primary efficacy endpoint (composite endpoint of all VTE/all-cause death). The point 
estimate  was  1.39%  vs.  3.86%;  p  <  0.0001,  relative  risk  reduction  [RRR]:  64%  -  95%  CI  =  0.22, 
0.54).  More  importantly,  this  superiority  was  demonstrated  also  on  major  VTE  (proximal  DVT,  non-
fatal PE and VTE-related death).  Reported event rates were 0.45% vs. 1.14%; p=0.0107, RRR: 60% - 
95%  CI  =  0.15,  0.80.  Results  of  the  main  secondary  endpoints  are  mainly  driven  by  the  favorable 
results of proximal DVT (7 vs 20 cases in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups respectively). There is a 
reduction  in  the  events  of  non-fatal  PE  (apixaban(2)  and  enoxaparin(5))  but  there  was  one  case  of 
VTE-related  death  in  the  apixaban  arm.  In  the  follow-up  period,  PE  and  symptomatic  proximal  DVT 
were recorded in higher numbers in the enoxaparin (4 and 3 cases respectively) compared to none in 
the  apixaban  group.  A  benefit  of  apixaban  in  THR  over  the  standard  comparator  was  considered 
adequately proven. 
In  Total  Knee  Replacement  (TKR)  study  (CV185047),  superiority  of  apixaban  was  also  shown  over 
enoxaparin in the primary endpoint (15.06% vs. 24.37%; 2-sided p-value <0.0001, RRR: 38%; 95% 
CI = 0.51, 0.74) as well as the secondary endpoint (1.09% vs. 2.17%; p-value=0.0373, RRR: 50% - 
95% CI = 0.26, 0.97). This superiority is not only driven by the incidence of distal DVTs (14.52 % and 
23.9%  respectively),  but  also  the  clinically  relevant  proximal  DVT  events  (0.76%  and  2.17% 
respectively). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The superiority demonstrated by apixaban over enoxaparin in TKR was associated with an increase in 
PE  (3  vs  0  respectively)  and  one  VTE-related death  versus  no events  with enoxaparin.  Results  of the 
follow-up  period  show  one  additional  case  of  VTE-related  death,  2  cases  of  PE  and  2  cases  of 
symptomatic proximal VTE in apixaban arm versus 0, one and one case for enoxaparin respectively.  
In the TKR supportive US study, in which enoxaparin was administered as 30 mg BID, non-inferiority 
of  apixaban  against  enoxaparin  was  not  reached.  Importantly,  here  also  an  increase  in  PE  in  the 
apixaban group (n=14; 0.88%)  was observed compared to the enoxaparin group (n=7; 0.44%).  
There was an increase in VTE-related deaths in the apixaban arm in TKR (1 and 2 cases in the EU and 
US  studies  respectively)  compared  to  none  with  enoxaparin.  Three  major  issues  were  explored  as 
possible contributory factors to the higher incidence of events above described: patient characteristics, 
timing of initiation of apixaban and the posology. Patient characteristics (risk factors, compliance, co-
administration  of  other  drugs)  were  balanced  and  where  not  considered  by  the  CHMP  as  influential. 
Geographical location/medical practice probably had an effect on the higher incidence of PE reported in 
the US/Canada study compared to the EU study, but could not explain the higher incidence of PE in the 
apixaban compared to enoxaparin in the same study. Duration of hospital stay was also longer in the 
EU study than in the US, with better results in the EU study, precluding the duration of hospital stay to 
be  of  importance  in  the  current  assessment.  The  duration  of  thromboprophylaxis  used  in  the  TKR 
studies  are  in  line  with  previously  performed  studies  and  CHMP  guideline.  However,  in  some  patients 
an  extension  of  prophylaxis  beyond  14  days  could  have  been  beneficial  to  prevent  the  cases  of  PE 
reported  in  the  follow  up  period.  This  is  also  in  line  with  the  most  recent  ACCP  guideline  (2008)  and 
applies also to all other antithrombotics. The time of initiation of apixaban is more delayed than other 
anti-coagulants.  Presented  data  suggest  that  for  both  apixaban  and  enoxaparin  delayed  initiation  of 
administration  is  associated  with  higher  risk  for  total  VTE,  but  not  major  VTE.  The  advantages  of 
delayed initiation should probably be individually balanced against the VTE risk per agent used.

In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  this  increase  of  PE  events  was  probably  chance 
findings.  This  can  be  further  supported  by  the  observation  that  this  increase  of  PE  was  isolated, 
without a comparable increase in the incidence of DVT. This is not a likely event, considering that most 
PE events originate from the leg veins. In addition, the reported incidence of PE in the enoxaparin arm 
in the EU study was lower (0.07%) than the US study (0.44%), which is counterintuitive, considering 
the doses of enoxaparin used.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Available safety information related to apixaban 2.5 mg BID in the indication of VTEp was considered 
adequate  (n=5,924)  to  characterize  the  safety  profile  of  apixaban  in  this  indication.  The  duration  of 
exposure is also relevant to the indication.  
Overall,  results  indicate  that  the  adverse  events  and  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  profile  of 
apixaban was similar to that of enoxaparin.  
The overall frequency of SAEs with onset during the treatment period and the follow-up period in the 
four  pooled  VTEp  studies  was  similar  in  the  apixaban  and  enoxaparin  groups  (392  [6.6%]  and  396 
[6.7%],  respectively  in  the  treatment  period  and  in  the  follow-up  period:  46  [0.8%]  and  49  [0.9%] 
respectively. No SAE was reported for > 1% of subjects in either treatment group. The most frequently 
reported serious adverse events were deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 
Overall  event  rates  for  deaths  were  low  in  both  treatment  groups  with  only  numerical  differences 
between  treatment  groups  during  the  treatment  period  (apixaban  10/5924  [0.17%],  enoxaparin 
7/5904 [0.12%]). The event rates for death in the apixaban group were consistent with rates reported 
during  the  treatment  period  in  published  reports  of  enoxaparin-controlled  joint  replacement  studies 
(ranging from 0 to 0.3%).   
Fatal  PE  was  reported  by  the  investigators  for  5  (0.08%)  subjects  in  the  apixaban  group  and  1 
(0.02%) subject in the enoxaparin group. Of these deaths, 4 events in the apixaban group and 1 event 
in the enoxaparin group were confirmed by adjudication.  
The  rate  of  death  related  to  other  causes  was  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups  during  the 
treatment period (apixaban 5, enoxaparin 6) and the follow-up period [apixaban 3 and enoxaparin 2]. 
There  was  a  comparable  risk  of  bleeding  during  both  the  treatment  and  the  follow-up  periods  in  the 
two  pivotal  studies  between  apixaban  and  enoxaparin  administered  in  the  lower  dose  of  40  mg  QD, 
with major bleeding events slightly higher in the apixaban group in the THR study (0.82% vs 0.68%) 
and  slightly  lower  in  the  TKR  (0.6%  vs  0.98%).  In  study  CV185034,  in  which  enoxaparin  was 
administered as 30 mg BID a trend of lower risk of major bleeding was observed in favor of apixaban 
(adjusted  difference  of  event  rates  -0.81%;  p:  0.0533)  and  a  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  the 
composite  of  major/clinically  relevant  non  major  bleeding  (-1.46%;  p=0.0338).  Two  fatal  bleeding 
cases  were  reported  in  the  enoxaparin  group.  The  bleeding  profile  of  apixaban  appears  to  be  better 
compared to enoxaparin in the TKR studies. 
No clinically meaningful differences were noted in the frequencies of clinical laboratory test results for 
the apixaban and enoxaparin groups in any of the analysis periods. 
No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  noted  in  the  event  rates  for  bleeding  between  apixaban  and 
enoxaparin  groups  within  patients  subgroups.  Results  suggest  a  comparable  bleeding  risk  of  co-
administration of apixaban with NSAIDs compared to enoxaparin, sometimes even more favourable.  
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs from the clinical studies was comparable between the treatment 
groups in the 4 studies (apixaban 200 [3.4%], enoxaparin 217 [3.7%]), with DVT and PE as the most 
common AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Analysis  of  clinical  and  pre-clinical  data  did  not  support  a  hepatotoxic  potential  of  apixaban.  Actual 
representation of patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment in the current studies was not 
known,  but  patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  were  excluded  in  the  clinical  trials.  This  was  clearly 
identified in the SmPC together with the need to measure ALT before administration. The incidence of 
Page 59/62
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concurrent  elevations  of  ALT  >  3  x  ULN  and  total  bilirubin  >  2  x  ULN  was  numerically  higher  with 
apixaban (n=8) than that reported with enoxaparin (n=5), and causality was assessed as possible in 2 
apixaban cases, one of them was fatal. The causality of the drug in this fatal case was possible, but the 
contribution  of  other  concomitantly  administered  drugs  could  not  be  excluded.  Data  from  four 
completed clinical studies in other indications (n=2547) revealed one case of ALT > 3 x ULN and total 
bilirubin  >  2  x  ULN,  which  can  be  confounded  by  multiple  co-morbidities.  Blinded  data  from  ongoing 
studies suggested that apixaban is unlikely to be hepatotoxic. 
 “Transient elevation of liver tests” was included as an Identified Risk in the RMP, and “hepatotoxicity” 
will be closely monitored in the post marketing period.  
Apixaban,  clopidogrel  and  ASA  were  co-administered  in  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  ACS.  Results 
show an increased bleeding risk in these patients, particularly in elderly patients and patients with CrCl 
< 60 ml/min. These risks were reflected in the SmPC.  
Routine monitoring  of  apixaban  is  not  needed.  However,  in  cases  of  overdose  or  emergency  surgery, 
the commercially available Rotachrom assay can be used. This was reflected in the SmPC. 
Further  safety  data  from  the  completed/ongoing  studies  should  be  submitted  to  facilitate  the 
assessment of the safety profile of apixaban. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In  the  indication  of  VTEp  in  THR,  apixaban  showed  favourable  results  that  were  considered  by  the 
CHMP both statistically significant as well as clinically relevant compared to enoxaparin. 
The risk of bleeding was considered comparable to that of enoxaparin, with a slightly higher number of 
major bleedings 
In  the  indication  VTEp  in  TKR,  apixaban  also  showed  favourable  results  against  enoxaparin  in  the 
pivotal  study.  In  the  supportive  study,  non-inferiority  NI  against  enoxaparin  was  not  achieved.  The 
favourable  results  in  the  pivotal  study  were  considered  more  relevant  to  the  EU  population,  in 
particular taking into account the dose of enoxaparin used.  
The higher incidence of PE and to a lesser extent VTE-related death in the apixaban group, could not 
be explained based on the explored patient characteristics or apixaban posology. Based on the current 
knowledge and compared to other studies, this higher PE incidence was considered by the CHMP to be 
probably a chance finding.  
Bleeding risk appeared to be comparable if not better than enoxaparin. In the pivotal study, there were 
fewer major bleeding events in the apixaban group compared to enoxaparin.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the above data, the beneficial effects of apixaban outweigh the unfavourable results in VTEp 
in both THR and TKR.  Apixaban administration was associated with better efficacy in terms of superior 
reduction  of  the  clinically  relevant  events  of  VTE  compared  with  enoxaparin.  This  was  accompanied 
with a comparable bleeding risk (main results are depicted in the figure below).

In case of VTEp in TKR, more cases  of PE  and fatal PE  were recorded in the apixaban group. Further 
analysis  did  not  show  that  patient  characteristics  or  apixaban  posology  could  have  significantly 
contributed  to  these  cases.  Comparing  the  current  results  with  those  of  other  anti-coagulants,  from 
previously conducted studies, this higher PE incidence could be considered by the CHMP to be a chance 
finding and this was reflected in the SmPC. Time of initiation of apixaban is delayed compared to other 
agents,  which  probably  ensures  a  better  bleeding  profile,  however  this  advice  could  be  better 
individualized.  
Current  data  did  not  point  to  a  hepatotoxic  potential  for  apixaban.  Safety  data  from  the  ongoing 
studies should be submitted to facilitate further assessment of the safety profile for apixaban.  
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Based on the above data, the beneficial effects of apixaban outweigh the unfavourable results in VTEp 
in both THR and TKR.  Better efficacy in terms of superior reduction of the clinically relevant events of 
VTE compared with enoxaparin was demonstrated together with a comparable bleeding risk.  
Time  of  initiation  of  apixaban  is  delayed  compared  to  other  agents,  which  probably  ensures  a  better 
bleeding profile, however this advice could be better individualized. 
In case of VTEp in TKR, more cases of PE and fatal PE were recorded in the apixaban group although 
not  significantly  attributed  either  to  patient  characteristics  or  apixaban  posology.  Comparing  the 
current  results  with  those  of  other  anti-coagulants,  this  higher  PE  incidence  was  considered  by  the 
CHMP to be probably a chance finding and is reflected in the SmPC.  
The SmPC currently contains adequate warnings for subgroups who may have higher risk for bleeding 
due to PK or PD interactions, in particular patients administered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and 
P-gp, or platelet inhibitors, patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and elderly patients. 
Safety data from the ongoing studies should be submitted to facilitate further assessment of the safety 
profile of apixaban. 
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considered  that the  benefit/risk  of  apixaban  is  positive  for  the  prevention  of 
venous  thromboembolic  events  (VTE)  in  adult  patients  who  have  undergone  elective  hip  or  knee 
replacement surgery”.

2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the 
product information.  
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Eliquis in the prevention of VTE in adult patients who have undergone 
elective hip or knee replacement surgery was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of 
the marketing authorisation.

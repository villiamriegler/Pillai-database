2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a neoplasm arising from germinal or post germinal B cells. In Europe there 
were 2.40 newly diagnosed cases of classical HL per 100,000 in 2000-2002 (Sant et al, 2010). HL is 
characterised histologically by malignant Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg cells that are surrounded by 
non-malignant inflammatory cells. HL is divided in two major subtypes, based on immunohistological 
features and microscopic appearance of the malignant cells. The nodular lymphocyte predominant 
subtype (NLPHL) makes up 5% of all HL and has a generally more indolent course than classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Most but not all NLPHL are CD30 negative, whereas CD30 expression is a 
standard feature of RS cells in cHL. NLPHL expresses CD45 and CD20, whereas cHL is typically CD45 
negative and CD20 negative in 60-80% of cases. 
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma has four subtypes. The most common subtype is the nodular sclerosis 
subtype: 40-70%. The mixed cellularity subtype makes up 30-50% of cHL and possibly has a less 
favourable clinical course. The lymphocyte depletion subtype is rare and can be associated with AIDS.  
The lymphocyte rich subtype has been distinguished from NLPHL since 1999. It differs from NLPHL in 
that it is CD30+, CD20- and it has a higher relapse rate.  
HL is highly curable, with 80% of patients reaching complete remission. Prognosis is worse in patients 
who present with advanced disease, with 30-40% relapse after initial treatment or immediate 
treatment failure. Staging is according to the Ann Arbor criteria, which are based on localisation, the 
extent of nodal and extranodal involvement and the presence of the classical B symptoms. 
Standard first line treatment for limited stage disease consists of the ABVD combination chemotherapy 
regimen, followed by involved field radiotherapy. There is no consensus on the optimum treatment for 
advanced stage disease, with different approaches in the U.S. and Europe. Different combination 
chemotherapy regimens such as ABVD, BEACOPP and Stanford V have been compared. The role of 
radiotherapy and intermediate staging by FDG-PET are also currently evaluated. 
There is no standard treatment of relapsed or primary refractory disease. Salvage chemotherapy 
regimens such as DHAP/VIM/DHAP are usually followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous 
stem cell transplantation. Patients, who are not cured with front-line or second-line therapy, including 
stem cell transplantation, have an estimated median survival of less than 3 years. Gains are limited to 
disease free survival, but usually no overall survival gains are achieved (Horning et al, 2008). 
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma of T-cell origin. There 
are two distinct forms, systemic ALCL and a primarily cutaneous form. ALCL accounts for 2-8% of all T-
cell lymphomas. CD30 is invariably expressed on the surface of ALCL cells. 
The clinical course is to a large extent dependent on ALK status. ALK positive patients are younger and 
have a better prognosis. Five year failure free survival after treatment was 60% in ALK positive 
compared to 36% in ALK negative ALCL and five year overall survival rate was 70% in ALK positive 
and 49% in ALK negative ALCL (Savage et al. Blood (2008) 111: 5496). Other independent prognostic 
factors include absence of marrow involvement and expression of CD56. 
In adults treatment with doxorubicin based regimens results in complete response in 70% and a 60% 
five year survival rate. Comparison of ABVD and MACOP-B showed comparable efficacy for these two 
regimens. About half of the patients relapse within two years (Tilly et al, 1997; Savage et al, 2008).

There is no consensus on the treatment of relapsed or refractory disease. Some patients benefited 
from high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. There have been reports of a graft 
versus ALCL effect after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 
Adcetris contains brentuximab vedotin (also known as SGN-35), which is a CD30-directed antibody-
drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the monoclonal antibody (cAC10) covalently linked, via an enzyme-
cleavable linker, to the antimitotic small molecule monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).  It is produced via 
the chemical conjugation of cAC10 to the small molecule SGD-1006 intermediate (SGD-1006), which 
contains both the linker and the MMAE. Brentuximab vedotin and consists of on average four molecules 
of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to the cAC10 monoclonal antibody. After binding to 
surface CD30 the conjugate undergoes endocytosis. MMAE becomes active after the linker between 
MMAE and the antibody is cleaved by the lysosome. MMAE interferes with tubulin polymerisation and 
thus disrupts formation of the mitotic spindle in dividing cells. The ensuing mitotic arrest eventually 
leads to cell death. 
CD30  is  a  member  of  the  tumour-necrosis  factor  receptor  superfamily.  It  was  originally  identified  on 
Reed-Sternberg  cells  of  Hodgkin  Lymphoma  (CD30  positive  Hodgkin  or  Reed  Sternberg  cells  express 
5,000  –  10,000  molecules  of  CD30)  but  is  also  expressed  on  subsets  of  non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma, 
including  anaplastic  large  cell  lymphoma  and  cutaneous  T  cell  lymphoma  as  well  as  on  rare  solid 
tumours  such  as  testicular  carcinomas  of  the  non-germinal  type  (embryonal  carcinomas).  In  non-
malignant  cells,  CD30 is  expressed  on  activated  but  not  resting  lymphocytes  (T,  B  and  NK  cells)  and 
weakly on activated monocytes. After binding to its ligand CD153, CD30 can activate NF-κB, JNK and 
p38. Furthermore, CD30 is expressed in decidual cells in the pregnant uterus. However, information on 
the function of CD30 in the immune system or during pregnancy is lacking.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Adcetris is indicated for the treatment of patients 
with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and for the treatment of patients with relapsed or 
refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 
The finally approved indication is the following: Adcetris is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma (HL): following autologous stem cell transplant 
(ASCT)  or  following  at  least  two  prior  therapies  when  ASCT  or  multi-agent  chemotherapy  is  not  a 
treatment  option.  Adcetris  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory 
systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 
The recommended dose is 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 
3 weeks.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of three components: A) the 
antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, B) the highly potent antimicrotubule agent 
monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), and C) a protease cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to 
cAC10.  
Figure 1: Schematic Diagram of SGN-35 
Binding of SGN-35 to CD30 on the cell surface initiates internalization of the SGN-35-CD30 complex, 
which then traffics to the lysosomal compartment.  Within the cell, MMAE is released from the 
monoclonal antibody via proteolytic cleavage and degradation of the drug linker.  Binding of MMAE to 
tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, induces mitotic cell cycle arrest, and results in 
apoptotic death of the CD30-expressing tumor cell.   
SGN-35 was also tested for effector function activity.  In vitro assays demonstrated no complement 
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and little antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the 
monoclonal antibody (cAC10) covalently linked, via an enzyme-cleavable linker, to the antimitotic 
small molecule monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).  It is produced via the chemical conjugation of the 
cAC10 Intermediate (cAC10) to the small molecule SGD-1006 Intermediate (SGD-1006), which 
contains both the linker and the MMAE.   
The amino acid sequences of SGN-35 heavy and light chains as well as the post-translational 
modifications associated with each are the same as those described in cAC10.  Each antibody molecule 
has, on average, two of its interchain disulfides reduced and the resulting cysteine residues alkylated 
with SGD-1006, leading to a molar ratio (MR D) of four drugs per antibody.  This leaves, on average, 
two interchain disulfides per molecule intact.  One drug conjugation site is located in the light chain 
and three conjugation sites are located in the heavy chain, resulting in many active forms with up to 
eight possible conjugation sites per antibody.

cAC10 Monoclonal Antibody Active Substance Intermediate 
Manufacture 
cAC10 is a recombinant heterotetrameric chimeric IgG1 with two kappa light chains and two gamma 1 
heavy chains. The expected average molar mass is 148,081 Da.  
cAC10 is manufactured according to a conventional cell culture system using a Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cell line.  The chimeric antibody product cAC10 is expressed from the fusion of the heavy and 
light chain variable region genes (VH and VL, respectively) from the murine anti-CD30 monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) AC-10 to the human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (G1) and kappa (κ) constant region 
genes, respectively.  
This recombinant antibody is encoded in expression plasmids and is expressed by CHO cells stably 
transfected with these plasmids. The description of generation of expression vectors is detailed and 
sufficient. Subsequent subcloning by limiting dilution produced a cell line with relatively high specific 
productivity, good growth characteristics, and desired product quality, and was used to produce the 
process development seed bank (PDSB), from which the cGMP master cell bank (MCB) and working cell 
bank (WCB) were derived. Testing and characterization of the Host Cell Bank (i.e. CHO cells) were 
performed in accordance with ICH Q5A, Q5B, and Q5D. The procedure for the generation and 
qualification of WCB has been provided.  
The cAC10 Intermediate manufacturing process is separated into six stages: 1. inoculum expansion, 2. 
production, 3. primary recovery and capture, 4. fine purification, 5. final bottling, and 6. shipping.  
The manufacturing for cAC10 is initiated by thawing a vial of the WCB containing CHO cells expressing 
the monoclonal antibody cAC10. After thaw, cells are serially expanded in vessels of increasing size 
until the production bioreactor where cells and cAC10 accumulate. After the production stage, cells and 
cell debris are removed from the harvest fluid. The product is purified via three chromatography steps. 
This is followed by a nanofiltration step to remove any potential adventitious viral agents. The pool is 
then concentrated and buffer exchanged into the formulation buffer via an ultrafiltration/diafiltration 
step. The purified and formulated cAC10 bulk is filtered, filled into bottles and stored frozen. Frozen 
cAC10 is shipped according to a validated process and stored frozen until further processing to 
brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) bulk drug substance. 
Three consecutive manufacturing batches were executed under process validation to demonstrate 
process consistency in cell culture, primary recovery and capture, and fine purification. During the 
cAC10 conformance manufacturing campaign, several other validation studies were also conducted in 
parallel to process validation. The capability of the downstream process steps to reduce process-
related impurities was evaluated in an impurity clearance validation study, which sufficiently 
guarantees adequate removal and consistent low levels. 
cAC10 is a recombinant heterotetrameric chimeric IgG1 with two kappa light chains and two gamma 1 
heavy chains. The structure, physicochemical characteristics, and immunological and biological 
properties of cAC10 have been established using a comprehensive set of methods. The expected 
average molar mass (148,081 Da) was confirmed. The N-terminal residue of the heavy chain is 
encoded as a glutamine, but exists mainly in the pyroglutamic acid form. There is one N-glycosylation 
site on the heavy chain (Asn297), and it is predominantly occupied with a typical core fucosylated 
biantennary glycan with 0, 1 or 2 terminal galactose residues. Additionally, the encoded C-terminal 
lysine of the heavy chain is post-translationally removed in the most prevalent form of cAC10. These 
properties are as expected for a chimeric IgG1 produced via a CHO cell culture process.

Specification 
The release specifications for cAC10 intermediate include tests for Identity, Purity, Potency, Content, 
Safety  and Physical Characteristics, such as IEF, ELISA, peptide mapping, CE SDS, SEC, CE LIF, UV 
spec, bioburden, endotoxin, polysorbate 80, pH, osmolality and appearance.  Satisfactory validation of 
the analytical procedures has been performed in accordance with current ICH guidelines. The 
specifications have been established based on principles outlined in ICH Q6B and overall cover the 
structural features of the molecule.  
Batch analysis data from twelve GMP batches (eight development batches, three conformance batches 
and  one  post-conformance  batch)  are  provided.  The  release  results  for  batches  manufactured  using 
Process A&B, Process C and for the conformance batches demonstrate that the manufacturing process 
is  well  controlled.  In  addition,  the  data  demonstrates  that  each  of  the  manufacturing  processes 
consistently produces cAC10 with similar quality attributes. 
The  commercial  reference  material,  derived  from  a  liquid  fill  of  cAC10  lot  manufactured  using  the 
commercial  process,  (Process  C),  was  qualified  by  release  testing  using  analytical  procedures 
appropriate at the time of qualification and extensive characterization. 
A  sterile  polyethylene  terephthalate  glycol  (PETG)  media  bottle  with  white  high  density  polyethylene 
(HDPE) screw closure is used as the container closure system for cAC10 Intermediate.  
Stability 
Overall, the stability data obtained from stability testing of 3 primary stability lots, 3 conformance lots, 
and  3  supporting  stability  lots  support  the  cAC10  expiration  dating  of  60  months  when  stored  at  the 
designated  storage  condition  in  the  commercial  container  closure  system.  The  proposed  cAC10  shelf-
life of 60 months, when stored at the designated storage condition in the commercial container closure 
system, is acceptable. 
Protease Cleavable Linker - MMAE (SGD-1006) Intermediate 
Manufacture 
SGD-1006 Intermediate (SGD-1006) is the drug-linker component of the SGN-35. The final SGD-1006 
Intermediate is packaged in amber glass bottles, and stored frozen. Following release, it is shipped 
using validated procedures to storage facilities and/or other manufacturer for further processing into 
SGN-35 BDS.  
In  general,  the  chemistry,  production,  and  quality  control  of  SGD-1006  have  been  described  in 
sufficient detail in the dossier. Process validation has demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
consistent, reliable, and repeatable. 
The characterisation of SGD-1006 has been established by state-of the-art analytical methods. Purity 
is the most important parameter of this intermediate as it influences the final product quality and 
potency.  
Specification 
The release specifications for SGD-1006 intermediate include tests for physical characteristics, 
Identity, Purity, Related substances, Assay, Water content, Residual solvent, and Impurities such as 
appearance, FTIR, HPLC, Specific rotation, Karl Fischer titration, GC and ICPMS. Satisfactory validation 
of the analytical procedures has been performed in accordance with current ICH guidelines.

Stability 
The stability data obtained from testing of primary stability lots, demonstrate that SGD-1006 when 
stored at specified conditions shows no degradation and no changes in other quality attributes for at 
least 24 months. A labelled storage condition with a retest period of 24 months is accepted for SGD-
1006 Intermediate. 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) active substance  
Manufacture 
The SGN-35 BDS manufacturing process is initiated by thawing, pooling, and filtering cAC10 solution 
into the reaction vessel. cAC10 interchain disulfide bonds are reduced by addition of the reducing 
agent tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP HCl). SGD-1006 is then added, in excess, to 
react with the cAC10 thiols and form the ADC. Removal of process-related impurities and a citrate 
buffer exchange is accomplished by the tangential flow filtration step. The formulated bulk is filtered 
and filled into bottles to obtain the SGN-35 BDS. The individual bottles of BDS are frozen and stored. 
The frozen BDS is subsequently shipped to a storage facility. 
Incoming materials are cAC10 and SGD-1006 which are manufactured and released as stable 
intermediates. At the end of processing, these intermediates are referred to as “cAC10 Intermediate” 
and “SGD-1006 Intermediate”, respectively. 
Control of critical steps and intermediate 
The Applicant performed extensive process characterization studies, together with process validation. 
The studies serve to demonstrate that the process is robust provided that it is performed within well-
defined ranges. cAC10 and SGD-1006 are critical intermediates in the manufacture of SGN-35 BDS. 
Due to the importance of these intermediates, complete active substance sections are provided for 
cAC10 and SGD-1006. 
The Applicant has used some elements taken from ICH Q8, however, the dossier is not a Quality-by-
Design submission, therefore it might be called an ‘improved traditional approach’, or a ‘partially 
enhanced approach’. 
During the evaluation procedure a Major Objection was raised with regard to the control strategy for 
cAC10 and SGN-35, and in particular the way in which Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and In-
Process Controls (IPCs) were defined for the manufacturing process of cAC10 and SGN-35, based on 
process characterization and validation data was not deemed adequate. During the review, the 
Applicant provided clarification and justification for its approach, reclassified some Process Parameters 
(PPs) into CPPs, a number of Normal Operating Ranges (NORs) have been given new limits and 
additional justification for the IPCs was provided. 
This approach sufficiently assures that the manufacturing process is under control, that deviations will 
be handled in an appropriate manner, and that the process is able to manufacture a consistent product 
which will meet its specifications. Reclassification of PPs and re-evaluation of NORs within the 
Acceptable Operation Ranges (AORs) may happen through periodic process data review along with 
increased process knowledge and additional manufacturing history. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the applicant to re-evaluate, according to principles and concept of 
ICH Q8 and ICH Q11, the proposed control strategy for cAC10 and SGN-35 when additional guidance 
on implementation of these guidelines is available. 
Process Validation 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 17/102 
 
 
 
The results of the validation studies including 3 consecutive batches show that all parameters met the 
acceptance criteria, demonstrating process consistency, ability of the purification to reduce process-
related impurities, confirmation that mixing parameters ensure production of a homogeneous 
formulated bulk, and confirmation of uniformity of the batch across multiple bottle of BDS. 
Process development 
SGN-35 BDS has been manufactured by three versions of the same process designated Process A, 
Process B, and Process C. It is noted that process A, B, and C also include changes to cAC10 
manufacture. Process C BDS has been slightly optimized further after some batches were 
manufactured. The Applicant submitted extensive analytical comparability studies, especially in view of 
the limited extent of the changes and the large clinical data set obtained with process C material. 
Results show comparable performance between Process A, B, and C BDS manufacturing processes, as 
well as from batch-to-batch within a process. In addition, evaluation of BDS release data and analytical 
comparability studies demonstrate all three processes produced comparable BDS with a high degree of 
consistency. These data also serve as additional characterization data, suggesting that e.g. 
glycosylation/afucosylation is indeed consistent.   
Characterisation and impurities 
SGN-35 has been characterised structurally by spectroscopic, electrophoretic and chromatographic 
assays, and characterised functionally by ELISA and Immunoassays. Most experiments were performed 
in a comparative manner, comparing cAC10 and SGN-35, and demonstrating that conjugation does not 
have significant effects on primary structure, three-dimensional structure, charge heterogeneity, 
glycosylation, and binding to epitope. Conjugation does have significant effects on three parameters: 
potency (as intended), drug load (as intended) and aggregation.  
The expected average molar mass (153,352 Da) of SGN-35 was confirmed by LC/ESI-MS and primary 
structure by peptide mapping and amino acid analysis. Three peptides (Lys-C peptides L13, H15, and 
H16) were identified conjugated with drug linker. In addition, the conjugated peptide map is the most 
important proof that only a limited number of specific cysteine residues are reduced and targeted for 
conjugation. Only the interchain conjugated peptides can be detected. 
The glycoform structure was detailed. Secondary and higher order structures were analyzed. Drug load 
variants were characterized and identified. The average drug-to antibody molar ratio (MRD) for the 
commercial reference material was calculated as 4.0. All drug-load variants showed similar binding 
activity and showed increasing cytotoxicity with increasing drug load.  
SGN-35 Size variants were assessed. The most abundant high and low molecular weight forms were 
identified as dimeric SGN-35 and Fc+Fab fragment. Conjugation increased the abundance of dimer and 
low molecular weight species relative to cAC10.  
SGN-35 charge variants were separated and characterized. The basic charge variants are composed 
primarily of heavy chain variants that differ in the degree of amino terminal cyclization and in the 
number of C-terminal lysine residues. Acidic variants showed evidence of deamidation, sialylation, and 
fragmentation.  
Free sulfhydryl levels were comparable for cAC10 and SGN-35 indicating that cysteine residues, 
reduced during the BDS manufacturing process, are efficiently alkylated with drug-linker. 
The binding affinity of SGN-35 was assessed by ELISAs and by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The 
binding affinity of SGN-35 for human CD30 was assessed. These experiments show that SGN-35 
retains the immunological properties of cAC10. 
The main biological activity of SGN-35 is believed to be cytotoxicity upon its binding to CD30-
expressing tumor cells, internalisation of ADC, release of MMAE and apoptosis of tumor cells. SGN-35 
Adcetris

presented strong cell killing activity in a dose dependent manner as opposed to the cAC10 antibody. In 
addition, as observed for cAC10, SGN-35 lacks effector functions such as Complement-Dependent 
Cytotoxicity (CDC) activity and displays only little Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
activity. 
The data presented in characterisation section confirm that conjugation targets cysteine residues 
involved in inter-chain disulfide bond formation resulting in an ADC with, on average, two of its 
interchain disulfides reduced and the resulting cysteine residues alkylated with SGD-1006 Intermediate 
(SGD-1006), leading to an average molar ratio (MRD) of four drugs per antibody. This leaves, on 
average, two inter-chain disulfides per molecule intact. One drug conjugation site is located in the light 
chain and three conjugation sites are located in the heavy chain, resulting in many active forms with 
up to eight possible conjugation sites per antibody. Despite the reduced number of inter-chain disulfide 
bonds, SGN-35 exists primarily as a monomer composed of 2 heavy and 2 light chains. Post-
translational modifications, such as intra-chain disulfide bonds and glycans, are not impacted by the 
BDS manufacturing process. No evidence was found that the BDS manufacturing process induces 
chemical changes such as oxidation or deamidation to the peptide backbone nor does significantly 
disrupt the higher order structure of the molecule. Additionally, the BDS manufacturing process does 
not alter the charge profile of SGN-35, relative to cAC10.  
Products and process related impurities are in general sufficiently discussed and their impact on safety 
is assessed.  
Specification 
The release specifications for the SGN-35 active substance include tests for Identity, Purity, Potency, 
Strength, Safety  and Physical Characteristics such as IEF, HPLC, SEC, ELISA, CE SDS, free drug 
related impurities, cytotoxicity, UV spec, bioburden, endotoxin, polysorbate 80, pH, osmolality and 
appearance.  Satisfactory validation of the analytical procedures has been performed in accordance 
with current ICH guidelines. Upon request, the applicant has reviewed the acceptance criteria for a 
number of specific methods. 
Overall, the specifications proposed for SGN-35 is considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality 
with respect to purity and level of impurities.  
The Applicant has committed to review all specifications and limits after an appropriate number of 
batches have been manufactured with the commercial and validated process C.  
Three lots of brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) reference material have been used for release and/or 
stability testing of SGN-35 bulk drug substance (BDS). The reference materials are controlled by 
annual assessment of stability at the storage temperature. Written procedures are in place for 
qualification, certification, and control of current and future product reference material. Extended 
characterization, in addition to the certification testing was performed to qualify the SGN-35 
commercial reference material.  
A sterile polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) media bottle with white high density polyethylene 
(HDPE) screw closure is used as the container closure system for SGN-35 BDS.  
Stability 
Overall, the stability data obtained from stability testing of 3 primary stability lots, 3 conformance lots, 
and 6 supporting stability lots support the SGN-35 BDS expiration dating of 60 months when stored at 
the designated storage condition in the commercial container closure system. In accordance with EU

GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be 
reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
SGN-35 finished product is a sterile, preservative free, white to off-white lyophilized cake or powder 
supplied in a single use container. Prior to administration, SGN-35 finished product is reconstituted 
with 10.5 mL of sterile Water for Injection resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution 
containing 5 mg/mL SGN-35, 20 mM sodium citrate, 6.3% (w/v) trehalose, 0.2 mg/mL polysorbate 80, 
pH 6.6. For administration, the reconstituted solution is added to an intravenous infusion bag 
containing infusion solution.  
All formulation steps are performed during BDS manufacturing. There are no further formulation steps 
performed during the finished product manufacturing process. Each vial contains an overfill, relative to 
the nominal content (50 mg per vial). There are no overages. Each vial is filled with SGN-35 BDS and 
subsequently lyophilized. 
The quantitative composition of SGN-35 in each vial, along with the function and quality standard of 
each component, is provided in the table below. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The final formulation was selected prior to the initiation of the toxicology studies for the Investigational 
New Drug application and there have been no changes to the formulation throughout the development 
history of SGN-35 DP. The SGN-35 formulation was further characterized to assess the impact of pH, 
temperature, multiple freeze/thaw cycles, and elevated temperatures on a variety of product quality 
attributes. Studies were also conducted to examine the stability of the reconstituted SGN-35 finished 
product, and the photostability of both the SGN-35 BDS and SGN-35 finished product.  These studies 
showed that the potential stresses during manufacturing, storage, and handling of the formulated BDS 
and finished product had no discernable impact on product quality. 
Finished product development: SGN-35 BDS and finished product have been manufactured by three 
versions of the same process designated Process A, Process B, and Process C, the latter of which is the 
validated,  commercial process.  
Process A was used to produce material for initial clinical trials.  For Process B, no changes to the 
finished product process were implemented, whereas process C is the up scaled commercial process. 
Comparability between finished product process B and C is demonstrated. Furthermore, all 3 lots 
manufactured using Process C show similar size distributions indicating good process consistency.  
The differentiation between finished product Process A and Process B is a result of the changes to the 
SGD-1006, therefore comparability is described in the BDS part.  Since only initial clinical studies were 
performed with DP from process A, the omission of a comparability study for finished product Process 
A is acceptable.   
Adventitious agents 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01-rev.3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. The 
cAC10 Intermediate is produced in a serum-free culture medium. No animal derived material is added

during fermentation of cAC10. The MCB and WCB which have been established are free from TSE-risk 
substances. The virus safety of Adcetris has been sufficiently demonstrated. The cells used for 
production of cAC10 have been sufficiently screened for viruses. No viral contaminant was found in the 
MCB, WCBs and PPCBs of cAC10 with the exception of intracellular A-type retroviral particles which are 
well known to be present in CHO cells. However, this is acceptable since there is sufficient capacity 
within the manufacturing procedure of cAC10 for reduction of this type of viral particles. Therefore, 
there are no concerns for the use in the production process of cAC10. The purification process of cAC10 
includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses. The effectiveness of these steps 
has been sufficiently demonstrated. The reduction of enveloped viruses is mainly through low pH 
inactivation and removal by virus filtration (nanofiltration). For the non-enveloped viruses most 
reduction occurs at the virus filtration step. More moderate virus reduction is observed with two of the 
chromatography steps.  One chromatography step was very effective for removal of the model virus 
reovirus type 3. The use of re-used chromatographic resins has been investigated and shown not to 
result in a loss of virus reduction capacity.  
Manufacture of the product 
Batch release of finished product is performed by Takeda Italia Farmaceutici S.P.A., Cerano, Italy. 
SGN-35 finished product manufacturing process involves thawing of SGN-35 BDS, pooling and mixing, 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilization, capping, visual inspection, and packaging. The control 
strategy for SGN-35 finished product manufacturing process includes raw material and intermediate 
controls, procedural and environmental, process parameter controls, in-process controls, release 
testing, stability testing, and process validation. The critical process steps, control points, and 
impacted CQA for the finished product manufacturing process are provided. Validation of the 
manufacturing process for SGN-35 was successfully completed. Three consecutive full scale 
conformance runs were produced meeting all the requirements defined in the validation protocols. In 
addition, the shipping process was also successfully validated for the shipment of SGN-35 finished 
product. 
Product specification 
Specification and release criteria for brentuximab vedotin finished product have been established to 
ensure Identity, Purity, Potency, Strength, Safety  and Quality with test methods such as IEF, HIC, 
SEC, CE SDS, free drug related impurities, cytotoxicity, UV spec, conjugate content, sterility, content 
uniformity, endotoxin, reconstitution time, pH of reconstituted solution, osmolality of reconstituted 
solution and appearance .  Many of the analytical procedures used for testing the finished product are 
the same as the active substance. Following request from CHMP the applicant has reviewed the 
acceptance criteria fora number of specific test methods. Upon request, the acceptance limit for 
potency determination by cytotoxicity has been further justified by the applicant and is considered 
acceptable at this point in time, although data suggests that future tightening should be feasible. In 
addition, an orthogonal method has been implemented as a separate test for finished product to 
further support the data from the cell-based assay. The specification has been aligned for all three 
cAC10 intermediate, BDS, and finished product.  
Overall, all the methods for release testing of the finished product have been adequately described 
justified and validated. The proposed limits are acceptable. 
All excipients are of compendial grade quality. No novel, human or animal derived excipients or 
excipients prohibited for use in drugs are used at any stage of manufacture.

Stability of the product 
Available stability data (both real time and accelerated) from process A, B and C batches, and the 
comparability of process A, B and C  material support a finished product shelf life of 36 months at the 
designated storage condition of 2-8°C. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out-of-
specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During the evaluation procedure a major objection was raised with regard to the control strategy for 
cAC10 and SGN-35. In particular, the way in which CPPs and IPCs were defined for the manufacturing 
process of cAC10 and SGN-35, was not deemed adequate. During the review, the Applicant provided 
clarification and justification for its approach, reclassified some PPs into CPPs, a number of NORs have 
been given new limits and additional justification for the IPCs was provided. 
This approach sufficiently assures that the manufacturing process is under control, that deviations will 
be handled in an appropriate manner, and that the process is able to manufacture a consistent product 
which will meet its specifications. Reclassification of PPs and re-evaluation of NORs within the AORs 
may happen through periodic process data review along with increased process knowledge and 
additional manufacturing history.  
In addition, CHMP recommends the applicant to re-evaluate, according to principles and concept of 
ICH Q8 and ICH Q11, the proposed control strategy for cAC10 and SGN-35 when additional guidance 
on implementation of these guidelines is available.  
In addition, there were several minor issues/other concerns/points for clarification, which were 
resolved before approval to further guarantee that SGN-35 is manufactured and controlled according to 
the current state of the art. Most of the identified other concerns related to specifications, i.e. release 
testing, analytical methods, validation, and stability.  
In conclusion, with regards to the biological and pharmaceutical aspects of Adcetris, the CHMP 
considers that all issues have been resolved by the Applicant. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been 
presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends certain points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in immunocompromised mice. The single in vivo 
safety pharmacology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys and it was GLP compliant (and so 
was the only other safety pharmacology study conducted in hERG-transfected HEK cells). Single- and 
repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted in rats and monkeys. The pivotal repeat-dose toxicity 
studies were GLP compliant. 
The Applicant received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP. The non-clinical advice pertained to safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and embryofoetal development 
studies.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Binding of brentuximab vedotin and unconjugated brentuximab to CD30 was evaluated by using flow 
cytometry and time-resolved fluorometry. Both brentuximab vedotin and unconjugated brentuximab 
bound with a Kd of 0.2 nM to human and cynomolgus CD30-positive primary lymphocytes, but not to 
rat or mouse CD30-positive cells or cells not expressing CD30. As a positive control, recombinant 
humanCD30L/murineCD8α fusion protein did bind to rat and mouse cells (data not shown). 
By using immunofluorescence microscopy, it was shown that brentuximab vedotin was bound to the 
surface of CD30-positive L540cy cells and detected within the lysosomal compartment within 4 hours 
of treatment. Co-localisation within lysosomes increased over time of exposure to brentuximab 
vedotin. Unconjugated brentuximab was similarly internalised but with delayed kinetics compared to 
brentuximab vedotin. Neither agent was detected on the surface of CD30-negative cells (data not 
shown). 
Incubation of brentuximab vedotin with purified human lysosomal protease cathepsin B or lysosome-
enriched fractions purified from the human ALCL Karpas 299 cell line released MMAE from brentuximab 
vedotin in a time-dependent manner as measured by Western blot analysis and liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry. Addition of a cysteine protease inhibitor, E64d, blocked the 
catabolism of brentuximab vedotin and restored the drug-associated signal detected by Western blot 
analysis. Quantification of MMAE release by using LC-MS/MS revealed that 43-55% of MMAE was 
released after 2 hours of incubation.  
To determine the fraction of total MMAE that is released from brentuximab vedotin, CD30-positive 
Hodgkin lymphoma L540cy and anaplastic large cell lymphoma Karpas 299 cells were incubated with 
brentuximab vedotin containing [14C]MMAE. Results revealed that most of the drug was initially 
membrane-associated, but that intracellular drug levels increased over the course of the experiment. 
In addition, the majority of intracellular drug was free. Generation of free MMAE inside and outside of 
L540cy cells was greatly reduced when cells were treated with chloroquine, an agent that raises 
lysosomal pH and reduces the activity of lysosomal protease (data not shown). 
In a cell-free system using bovine brain tubulin, MMAE was shown to inhibit microtubule polymerisation 
with an IC50 of approximately 1 µM. Treatment of Tera-2 carcinoma cells with MMAE (0.75 nM, 24 
hours) led to disruption of the intracellular microtubule network (data not shown).

Anti-tumour activity of brentuximab vedotin was shown in proliferation assays in vitro. Cytotoxic 
activity of brentuximab vedotin against a panel of CD30+ Hodgkin Lymphoma and anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma cell lines was shown. The IC50 was approximately 0.01 – 0.1 nM, while it was > 6.7 nM for 
CD30-negative cell lines. In this in vitro cytotoxicity assay, the free drug MMAE was effective against 
both CD30-positive and –negative cell lines (IC50 0.1 – 2.3 nM). In vivo anti-tumour activity of 
brentuximab vedotin was demonstrated in three xenograft transplant models derived from human HL 
and ALCL cell lines. In all 3 models, brentuximab vedotin treatment induced a dose-dependent anti-
tumour activity (i.e. delay in tumour growth or durable complete remission, data not shown).  
In addition to the cytotoxic activity, the immunological effector functions potentially mediated by 
brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in vitro. Brentuximab vedotin induced phagocytosis of CD30-
positive WIL-2S cells by human monocyte-derived macrophages while it did not induce antibody-
dependent or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. No studies addressing the potential interaction of 
brentuximab vedotin with F C-gamma receptors were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects).  
The anti-tumour activity of SGN-35 was evaluated in vivo in xenograft models derived from human HL 
and ALCL cell lines.  
The L428 HL cells form progressive tumours when injected subcutaneously in NOD SCID gamma mice. 
Dosing was initiated when the average tumour volume was 100 mm3 (day 10). In mice treated with 
SGN-35 (1 mg/kg IP every 4 days for 4 doses), L428 growth was delayed. In a second experiment, 
SGN-35 was dosed at 2 mg/kg every 4 days for 3 doses. In this study all tumours regressed and 4/5 
mice had no detectable tumours at the end of the study on day 108. At this higher dose, a delayed 
tumor progression was observed also in mice treated with the control ADC (data not shown).  
L540cy HL cells form progressive tumours when injected SC into SCID mice. Treatment was initiated 
when the average tumour volume in all mice was approximately 100 mm3. In mice treated with SGN-
35 (1 mg/kg IP, q4dx4) tumour growth was delayed. When SGN-35 was dosed at 3 mg/kg q4dx4, all 
tumors regressed and 5/5 mice had no detectable tumours at the end of the study on day 102. At 3 
mg/kg a delay in tumour growth was also observed for the control ADC, but the response was not 
durable (data not shown). 
SCID mice bearing SC Karpas 299 tumours were treated via IV injection q4dx4. A dose-dependent 
delay in tumour growth was observed in the SGN-35 treated groups. At the higher dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 
7/8 mice had no palpable tumour at the end of the study (day 96). cAC10, MMAE alone or in 
combination did not induce tumour growth inhibition. In mice bearing disseminated Karpas 299 
tumours, a dose-dependent survival advantage was observed in mice treated with SGN-35. A mixture 
of cAC10 and MMAE prolonged survival but was less active than the equivalent 3 mg/kg dose of 
SGN-35 (data not shown). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Biotin-conjugated brentuximab vedotin was applied to sections from 30 various tissues of humans and 
cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of 2.5 and 12.5 µg/ml brentuximab 
vedotin (optimal concentration and 5 times the optimal concentration, respectively). No specific 
staining was observed when biotinylated brentuximab vedotin was applied to a panel of representative 
human tissues from 3 separate individuals at either of the 2 concentrations tested. With the exception 
of epithelial cells in the thyroid, no binding of biotinylated brentuximab vedotin was seen in any 
cynomolgus monkey tissue examined at either concentration. Low to moderately high positive staining 
of cells in the thyroid epithelium was observed in 2/3 cynomolgus monkey samples at 2.5 µg/ml 
biotinylated brentuximab vedotin. At 12.5 µg/ml, epithelial cells in all 3 samples of cynomolgus 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 24/102 
 
 
 
monkey thyroid were low to moderately positive. No evidence of biotinylated brentuximab vedotin 
binding was observed in the adjacent parathyroid tissues at both concentrations (data not shown). 
In an additional study, evaluating tissue cross-reactivity of 2.5 and 12.5 µg/ml brentuximab vedotin 
with human tissues and rat liver tissue, specific staining was observed with biotinylated brentuximab 
vedotin in several tissue elements of the human tissue panel: human mononuclear cells, hematopoietic 
precursor cells, spindloid cells, oviduct and bronchial epithelium (cilia), and keratin squames/debris.  
This intracellular staining was observed mostly at the highest concentration  tested. There was also 
staining of extracellular material, notably intracolonic fecal material, pulmonary amorphous material, 
ovarian cystic fluid, contents of a dermal duct, endometrial luminal secretions, colloid, and lens 
protein. There was no biotinylated brentuximab vedotin-specific staining of rat liver tissues. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Regarding safety pharmacology, the effect of the free drug MMAE on hERG K+ channel activity was 
examined in vitro by whole cell voltage clamp analysis. In HEK 293 cells which expressed the human 
hERG K+ channel, MMAE produced a fractional block of peak hERG tail current that was significantly 
different from the negative control at high MMAE concentration (100 µM) but not at the low 
concentration (10 µM, data not shown).  
In a dedicated safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys a single IV infusion of 0.3, 1 and 
3 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin to conscious, radio-telemetered cynomolgus monkeys did not affect 
cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, ECG intervals including RR, QT 
and QTc), respiratory parameters (respiratory rate and blood gases), central nervous system 
parameters (behaviour, visual evaluation, reflex evaluation, motor/sensory, facial movement, pupils, 
visual field, vestubilocochlear, prehension and swallowing, proprioception and body temperature), body 
weight, hematology, plasma chemistry and coagulation parameters within 4 days after infusion (data 
not shown).  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic interaction studies were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies of brentuximab vedotin were conducted in rats and monkeys 
using the clinically intended IV route. In order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of SGN-35, 
concentrations of three analytes were measured: 1. SGN-35, 2. total antibody (TAb) (SGN-35 plus 
unconjugated cAC10), and 3. SGD-1010.The immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin in both rats and 
monkeys was also assessed by measuring rat and primate anti-human antibodies (RAHA and PAHA). 
After IV application of SGN-35 to the rat, the primary moiety in circulation was SGN-35. The 
pharmacokinetic profile of SGN-35 was similar to other monoclonal antibody products with a limited 
volume of distribution, a low clearance and a long half-life of 8 to 15 days. SGN-35 exposures were 
approximately dose-proportional. TAb (cAC10 plus SGN-35) exposures were generally greater than 
exposures to SGN-35. The active moiety, SGD-1010, was present at a molar ratio of 0.001 or lower. 
Because of the very low levels of SGD-1010 in circulation, concentrations could only be measured for 
10 days. For purposes of comparison, a truncated SGN-35 half-life was estimated over a time period of 
up to 7 days, comparable to the duration used for estimation of half-life of SGD-1010.  The truncated 
SGN-35 half-life was 2 to 2.5 days, similar to that of SGD-1010.  In a subsequent study in which rats 
received a single dose of un-conjugated SGD-1010 alone, the half-life for SGD-1010 was about 5.6 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 25/102 
 
 
 
hours. These results suggest that the pharmacokinetic of SD-1010 is governed by the rate of SGD-
1010 release from SGN-35 resulting in longer exposure to SGD-1010 from SGN-35 than when SGD-
1010 was administered alone. 
The incidence of RAHA (rat antihuman antibodies) was determined in the rat PK study. 50 % of rats 
(3/6) administered 5 mg/kg SGN-35 showed RAHA whereas in the lower dose group of 0.5 mg/kg no 
RAHA were detected. 
The pharmacokinetics of SGN-35, TAb and SGD-1010 were evaluated after a single IV infusion of SGN-
35 in two separate studies in the monkey. SGN-35 exposures were dose-proportional to greater than 
dose-proportional from 0.3 to 3 mg/kg SGN-35. The SGN-35 terminal elimination half-life ranged from 
1.6 to 2.7 days. Clearance and distribution at steady state were similar across doses. Exposure to TAb 
(cAC10 plus SGN 35) increased with SGN-35 dose and was greater than exposure to SGN-35. The 
increase in mean serum Cmax was approximately dose-proportional. Circulating SGD-1010 
concentrations were approximately 1000-fold lower than SGN-35 on the basis of molar ratios. Like in 
rats, SGD-1010 exhibited formation-limited kinetics depending on release from SGN-35. 
PAHA (primate antihuman antibodies) were seen in all animals in the one study and in 5 of 6 of 
animals in the other study. The impact of PAHA on the pharmacokinetic parameters was not formally 
characterised. In general, the incidence of PAHA appeared to be higher than the incidence of RAHA. 
Data on repeat-dose kinetics are available from the repeat-dose toxicology studies and are discussed 
in the section on toxicokinetics below. Interspecies comparison was only performed for SGN-35 
exposure (AUC and Cmax) and is also presented in the same section. 
The apparent terminal half-life of MMAE was 2.5 and 3.0 days in rats and monkeys, respectively, which 
is similar to the half-life of brentuximab vedotin when measured over the same time range. MMAE 
exposure was approximately dose-proportional in rats and monkeys after administration of 
brentuximab vedotin. Circulating MMAE concentrations were approximately 1000-fold lower than 
brentuximab vedotin. The pharmacokinetic parameters of MMAE after administration of brentuximab 
vedotin appeared to be governed by the rate of release of MMAE from brentuximab vedotin, resulting 
in a longer but much lower exposure to MMAE than when MMAE was administered. After a single IV 
dose of MMAE, V ss was high, suggesting extended tissue distribution. This was confirmed in a study in 
rats, showing rapid and wide distribution to the tissues after intravenous administration of MMAE. 
MMAE was mainly distributed to pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid, lung, kidney, liver and 
subsequently bile and intestine. The apparent half-life of MMAE after administration of brentuximab 
vedotin was considerably longer (2.5-3.0 days) than the half-life after administration of unconjugated 
MMAE (5.7-5.8 hours). 
Binding of SGD-1010 to plasma protein from mouse, rat, monkey, and humans showed that the 
protein binding of SGD-1010 was species-dependent, with higher levels of binding (67.9% to 82.2%) 
in rats and humans than in mice and monkeys (17.1 % to 28.5 %). Moreover, in vitro experiments 
suggested that the mc-vcSGD-1010 drug linker is transferred to serum proteins. Serum albumin was 
identified as being the primary species to which mc-MMAF (monomethyl auristatin F) is transferred. 
Maleimide transfer was assessed in human samples and the extent of maleimide transfer was 
determined to be approximately 1.5 % of all conjugated SGD-1010. Finally, no studies on blood cell 
distribution of SGD-1010 were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Studies to assess the permeability of SGD-1010 across Caco-2 cell monolayers indicated that SGD-
1010 is actively transported by P-gp through the Caco2 monolayers and, accordingly, is a substrate for 
P-gp. SGD-1010 was found to slightly inhibit the active transport of the P-gp substrate digoxin, with an 
IC50 greater than 50 µM. In conducting experiments with specific inhibitors for BCRP and MRP2, it 
could be shown that SGD-1010 is not a substrate for BCRP and MRP2.

No animal metabolism studies for the antibody component of brentuximab vedotin were submitted 
(see discussion on non-clinical aspects). However, to examine brentuximab vedotin cellular catabolism, 
unlabeled or 14C-radiolabeled brentuximab vedotin was added to cultures of CD30-positive cells and 
CD30-negative cells. CD30-negative cells did not release detectable levels of MMAE through the entire 
3-day course of the assay. In contrast, CD30-positive cell lines released MMAE from brentuximab 
vedotin, with high intracellular concentrations (>400 nM) reached within 24 hours of treatment. MMAE 
was identified as the only product of brentuximab vedotin catabolism. This finding was confirmed by 
the agreement of radiometric, mass spectrometry, and bioassay measurements of released drug 
concentration. Moreover, brentuximab vedotin was stable in rat, monkey, and human plasma. The 
rates of MMAE appearance in human and cynomolgus monkey plasma were barely discernible from the 
conversion rate measured in PBS. Approximately 2% of the MMAE was observed in rat plasma over the 
3-week period. 
SGD-1010 metabolism was evaluated using cultured rat, monkey, and human hepatocytes and human 
liver microsomes and in vitro model systems. Mass shifts and fragmentation patterns observed for the 
majority of metabolites detected were consistent with formation of metabolites by hydroxylation, 
demethylation, dehydrogenation, or hydrolysis. Metabolites formed in human hepatocytes were similar 
to those formed in rat and monkey hepatocytes. No human-unique metabolites were detected. Certain 
metabolites retained some of the cytotoxic activity of SGD-1010 (data not shown). 
Recombinant human CYP3A4 was able to covert [3H]-SGD-1010 to metabolites and formation of 
metabolites was blocked by the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole and by a monoclonal antibody against 
CYP3A4. CYP2D6 also converted [3H]-SGD-1010. In addition, strong correlations were observed 
between CYP3A4 activity and the formation of the main metabolites in a bank of 16 individual human 
liver microsomes. 
An in vitro study in cultured human hepatocytes assessed the potential of SGD-1010 to induce 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5, On the basis of these findings, SGD-1010 was postulated 
not to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4/5 (data not shown). 
An in vitro study was performed in human liver microsomes to evaluate the potential of SGD-1010 to 
inhibit the major CYP isozymes: CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5. SGD-1010 caused 
little or no direct inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6. SGD-1010 was found to be a 
weak reversible CYP3A inhibitor (with an IC50 of 10 µM) and a quasi-irreversible, time-dependent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, as formation of a metabolite inhibitory complex prevents the catalytic 
hematoporphyrin from binding oxygen. Further characterisation of this time-dependent inhibition 
suggests that SGD-1010 has the potential to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, with a 
Kintact (rate constant of irreversible inactivation) value of 0.10 minutes to 1 minute, and a Ki 
(inhibition constant) value of 1.12 µM, yielding a modest kintact-to-ki ratio of 90 minutes to 1mM-1. 
The  major  route  of  elimination  in  animals  dosed  with  cAC10-vc-[3H]SGD-1010  or  [3H]SGD-1010  was 
biliary/fecal with approximately 106 % to 112 % recovery of radioactivity in male and female rats. The 
majority  of  the  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  feces  for  both  male  and  female  rats  (89.3 %  to  101.8 
%). The remainder of the radioactivity was recovered in urine (7.1 % to 15.1 %). The rate of [3H]SGD-
1010  excretion  for  animals  dosed  with  cAC10-vc-[3H]SGD-1010  was  slower  than  for  animals  dosed 
with  [3H]SGD-1010,  the  active  moiety  alone,  indicating  that  conjugation  to  the  antibody  lowers  the 
rate of excretion. The primary species excreted in animals dosed with either test article was [3H]SGD-
1010,  showing  that  cAC10-vc-[3H]SGD-1010  is  converted  to  [3H]SGD-1010  and  excreted  intact. 
cAC10-vc-[3H]SGD-1010 was not excreted. A second radiolabeled species was observed in faeces and 
5 additional metabolites were observed in urine. However, 86 % to 100 % of the radioactivity excreted 
in  urine  was  accounted  for  as  [3H]SGD-1010  and  75  %  to  100  %  of  the  dose  administered  was 
excreted as [3H]SGD-1010 in faeces in rats administered either test article.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
A  series  of  single-dose  IV  toxicity  studies  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  acute  toxicity  of  MMAE  and 
the  antibody-drug-conjugate  SGN-35.  For  selection  of  the  lead  candidate  different  antibody-drug 
conjugates, i.e. cAC10 conjugated to 4 or 8 vcMMAE molecules, were tested in rats and cynomolgus. In 
addition, data on acute toxicity were obtained after a single administration in cynomolgus repeat-dose 
studies. Single dose toxicity studies are summarised in the following Table 10.

Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic parameters were obtained concurrently with repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys and 
rats and an embryotoxicity study in rats.  
An overview of the relative exposures to SGN-35 by species is provided in Table 14. Exposures 
associated with the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in rats and at the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) in monkeys are shown. The human exposures reflect the data collected for the 
proposed marketed dose of 1.8 mg/kg. The serum exposure to SGN-35 in rats at the HNSTD was 
approximately 3 to 4 times that in humans. The serum exposure to SGN-35 in monkeys at the NOAEL 
was approximately 2 to 3 times that in humans.

Local Tolerance  
Dedicated  studies  evaluating  local  tolerance  of  brentuximab  vedotin  were  not  submitted.  Microscopic 
examination  of  the  injections  sites  as  part  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  in  both  rats  and 
monkeys identified no test article-related effects at the injection sites.   
Other toxicity studies 
With regard to immunogenicity, the presence of PAHA or RAHA was assessed in toxicology studies to 
determine the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin and to assist in interpretation of the 
toxicokinetic data.  The impact of PAHA on the toxicokinetics of brentuximab vedotin was not formally 
determined.  Toxicokinetic parameters were estimated and reported separately for animals with and 
without PAHA.  In some studies, particularly when brentuximab vedotin was administered weekly, a

more rapid decline in brentuximab vedotin concentrations was apparent in monkeys that were positive 
for PAHA.  In the chronic toxicology study, the toxicokinetics of brentuximab vedotin in PAHA positive 
monkeys appeared to be altered in some and not in others.  Monkeys with high PAHA titers (greater 
than 10,000) were associated with increases in MMAE exposure (AUC and Cmax).  However, the 
increased MMAE exposures in monkeys in the chronic toxicology study were not associated with 
increased microscopic findings.

A PBT assessment has not been completed. Because of the nature of 
the active ingredient it is not amenable to the determination of log 
K ow according to standard guidelines. For the MMAE part of the 
active ingredient it would be possible to determine a log Kow. This 
has not been done. However, the resulting log Kow is not to be 
expected to be above 4.5 as the log octanol-water partitioning 
coefficient of the building blocks of MMAE Methylvaline, Valine, 
Dolaisoleucine, Dolaproline, and Norephedrine are each below 4.5

The PECsurfacewater value for brentuximab vedotin is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and 
brentuximab vedotin is not considered a PBT substance due to the size of the molecule. Therefore 
brentuximab vedotin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The following effector mechanism was proposed by the applicant: upon binding of brentuximab vedotin 
to cell surface CD30, the antibody-drug-conjugate is internalised, traffics to lysosomes and MMAE is 
released. This leads to dissolution of intracellular microtubule networks finally resulting in cell cycle 
arrest at the G2/M phase and ultimately cellular apoptosis. Each individual step of the proposed 
effector mechanism was experimentally demonstrated. Brentuximab vedotin was shown to traffic to 
lysosomes within 4 hours of treatment by co-localisation with the lysosomal antigen LAMP-1 using 
immunofluorescence microscopy. By subcellular fractionation using brentuximab vedotin conjugated to 
14C-labelled MMAE, it was shown that the drug is released intracellularly. This release occurred at 
37°C and was dependent on lysosomal activity. By mass spectrometry, released drug was identified as 
MMAE.  
After intracellular release, free MMAE appeared extracellularly over time. By this mechanism, free toxin 
may get into the circulation of treated patients and may cause toxicity in bystander cells. Such effect 
has indeed been demonstrated experimentally (Okeley et al, 2010). In co-cultures of CD30-positive 
and CD30-negative tumour cells treated with brentuximab vedotin, cytotoxic activity was also 
observed for CD30-negative cells. In cultures of CD30-negative cells alone, brentuximab vedotin did 
not mediate cytotoxicity. Of note, this study (Okeley et al, 2010) was not presented by the applicant in 
the MAA dossier.  
Taken together, the anti-tumour effector mechanism mediated by brentuximab vedotin as proposed by 
the applicant was sufficiently demonstrated. However, the presence of free MMAE in rats which are 
CD30-negative, and the appearance of free (unconjugated) brentuximab indicate that CD30-
independent release of MMAE may occur as well. It remains unclear if the linker may be cleaved as a 
result from proteolytic cleavage via non-lysosomal pathways following the cellular uptake of 
brentuximab vedotin via pinocytosis or binding to the FC-receptor, or as a consequence of maleimide 
transfer of the linker.  
With regard to the immunological effector functions potentially mediated by brentuximab vedotin, it 
was shown that brentuximab vedotin induced phagocytosis, while it did not induce antibody-dependent 
or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. No studies addressing the potential interaction of brentuximab 
vedotin with FC-gamma receptors were submitted. However, this is acceptable given the lack of 
immunological effector functions induced by brentuximab vedotin.   
In a cynomolgus monkey tissue cross-reactivity study, positive staining of thyroid samples of 3 animals 
suggests that the thyroid might be a potential target organ for brentuximab vedotin in patients. 
However, in the repeated-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no effect on thyroid tissue was 
observed. Furthermore, in human thyroid no tissue cross-reactivity was observed. Therefore, the 
finding in cynomolgus monkey thyroid tissue appears to be of limited or no toxicological significance. 
In a second tissue cross-reactivity study against human and rat tissues, staining of mononuclear and 
hematopoietic cells was in accordance with the expression pattern of CD30, while staining of spindloid 
cells, epithelia and extracellular material was unexpected but, nevertheless, no secondary 
pharmacodynalic effects have been identified to date. No other secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
were submitted which is considered acceptable, as secondary pharmacodynamic effects of SGN-35 
have not been identified to date. 
With regard to safety pharmacology, MMAE produced a fractional block of peak hERG tail current that 
was significantly different from the negative control at high MMAE concentration (100 µM) but not at 
the low concentration (10 µM).The 10 µM concentration of MMAE is approximately 1000x higher than 
the mean plasma Cmax of MMAE (approx. 7 nM) in patients treated with the clinical dose of 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 34/102 
 
 
 
brentuximab vedotin. Therefore, it is considered unlikely that MMAE derived from brentuximab vedotin 
would block hERG K+ channels in vivo. 
In a dedicated safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys a single IV infusion of brentuximab 
vedotin up to 3 mg/kg had no effect on the cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous systems.  
In addition to these studies, overall safety was based on the outcome of repeated-dose toxicity studies 
in which animals were treated with doses that achieved exposure levels that were 2- to 3-fold higher 
than the exposure level associated with the proposed marketed dose of 1.8 mg/kg for human patients. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). 
The pharmacokinetic properties of SGN-35 were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. Since SGN-35 has been developed for intravenous (IV) administration all non-clinical studies 
were conducted using the IV route of administration. In addition, to support the interpretation of 
exposure-response relationships in the toxicology studies, kinetic parameters after administration of 
MMAE (the active drug released from brentuximab vedotin) and unconjugated brentuximab 
(monoclonal antibody) was investigated in both rats and monkeys. For the purposes of interspecies 
comparison of the nonclinical findings in animals with those in humans, protein binding, metabolism, 
and excretion of MMAE was specifically addressed. The immunogenicity of SGN-35 was evaluated by 
measuring rat and primate anti-human antibodies (RAHA and PAHA) to determine whether anti-human 
antibodies affected exposure to SGN-35 in animals. Since cAC10 binds to monkey CD30 with a similar 
affinity as human CD30, the toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey allowed for assessment of antigen-
dependent toxicity of SGN-35. 
Brentuximab vedotin, unconjugated brentuximab, total antibody (TAb) and MMAE were measured 
using validated methods. Yet, interference of brentuximab vedotin in the rat anti-human antibody 
(RAHA) and primate anti-human antibody (PAHA) assays may have led to erroneous interpretation of 
samples as being RAHA or PAHA negative. 
Brentuximab vedotin showed a low clearance in rats and monkeys. The volume of distribution of 
brentuximab vedotin at steady state is low in both species, which suggests limited tissue distribution. 
The half-life for brentuximab vedotin was 8.5 to 14.6 days in rats and 1.6 to 2.7 days in monkeys 
compared to 4 to 6 days in patients. The exposure of brentuximab vedotin was approximately dose-
proportional in rats and approximately or greater than dose-proportional in monkeys. Exposures to 
brentuximab vedotin in humans were also approximately dose-proportional, similar to those in 
animals. The Cmax and Tmax of TAb after administration of brentuximab vedotin to rats were similar 
to those of brentuximab vedotin, while the exposure (AUC) was almost 2-fold higher. These results 
indicate deconjugation independent of CD30 may occur. As brentuximab vedotin is stable in plasma, 
deconjugation is possibly the result of intracellular cleavage of the linker by as yet unidentified 
pathways. 
Binding of MMAE to plasma proteins was low to moderate, suggesting that variation in the binding 
capacity of plasma proteins does not have a major impact on the concentration of free drug in plasma. 
Protein binding was concentration-dependent in mouse and human plasma and was shown to be higher 
in rats and humans than in mice and monkeys. Brentuximab vedotin, TAb and MMAE were measurable 
in fetal compartments on day 18 of gestation after administration of brentuximab vedotin on day 6 and 
13 of gestation, which demonstrates that brentuximab vedotin and unconjugated brentuximab and/or 
MMAE are transferred across the placenta following brentuximab vedotin treatment in rats. 
A blood-to-plasma ratio of 2 was observed after application of [3H]MMAE showing quick distribution of 
[3H]MMAE to erythrocytes, but after application of [3H]brentuximab vedotin, low blood-to-plasma

ratios suggest only minor distribution of [3H]brentuximab vedotin or of [3H]MMAE released from 
[3H]brentuximab vedotin  to erythrocytes.   
Since brentuximab vedotin was expected to be catabolised into individual amino acids in vivo, 
traditional metabolism studies were not performed for the antibody component. However, MMAE was 
the only product released from cells incubated with 14C-radiolabelled brentuximab vedotin. Moreover, 
brentuximab vedotin was stable in plasma. Yet, several signals, e.g. higher total antibody exposure 
values as compared to brentuximab vedotin exposure values and off-target toxicity and toxicity in rats, 
shown to have no binding sites for brentuximab vedotin, suggest that there might be CD30 
independent mechanisms of MMAE release. Moreover, MMAE exposure in cynomolgus monkeys after 
brentuximab vedotin administration is initially much lower than in humans treated with brentuximab 
vedotin. However, when cynomolgus monkeys develop a high anti-brentuximab antibody titer, MMAE 
exposure greatly increases, resulting in plasma Cmax values similar to those in humans, although AUC 
is still lower than in humans. The mechanism behind this interaction remains unclear. 
Metabolism of the active drug MMAE was studied. Twelve metabolites were identified in in vitro 
metabolism studies of MMAE in rat and monkey hepatocytes. The metabolism of MMAE is similar in rat, 
monkey, and human hepatocytes. Metabolites formed in human liver microsomes were similar to those 
formed in rat and monkey hepatocytes. Metabolite C8 was found to be approximately as cytotoxic and 
metabolites C4 and C7 less cytotoxic than MMAE in CD30-positive cell lines. MMAE was found to be a 
quasi-irreversible, mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and the primary in vitro metabolites are formed 
by CYP3A4. No human-unique metabolites were found in vitro, while an additional human metabolite 
was found in vivo. This metabolite is a product of 2 previously identified metabolic pathways. Yet, 
considering the relatively low plasma levels of metabolites and their ‘off-target’ formation, the 
contribution to the efficacy or side effects of brentuximab vedotin may be considered negligible. 
The predominant route of elimination of MMAE in rats was via faeces, suggesting that biliary excretion 
has occurred. One major metabolite was found in faeces (dolaproine O-demethyl-MMAE) and 5 
metabolites were found in urine, although the concentrations were low. Studies of excretion into milk 
were not submitted. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. A decision should be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from this therapy, taking into account 
a potential risk of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
MMAE did not induce any CYP isozymes in vitro. MMAE had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, but it is 
unlikely to have any clinical relevance. MMAE was not a substrate of BCRP or MRP2, but it was a 
substrate of P-gp. MMAE inhibits P-gp, however, not at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, 
interactions via P-gp inhibition are not expected. In addition, MMAE was shown not to be a substrate 
for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 uptake transporters. However, inhibition of these uptake 
transporters by MMAE has not been studied. Placental transfer of brentuximab vedotin, MMAE and TAb 
was shown in the rat. 
Myelotoxicity was the primary test article-related toxicity associated with single-dose IV administration 
of  brentuximab  vedotin  and  MMAE  across  both  species.  In  rats,  the  test  article-related  target  organs 
were  bone  marrow  (atrophy/hypocellularity),  mesenteric  lymph  node  (lymphoid  depletion),  thymus 
(lymphoid  depletion,  atrophy,  and  lymphoid  necrosis),  spleen  (lymphoid  depletion),  liver  (single-cell 
hepatocellular  necrosis,  bile  duct  hyperplasia/hypertrophy,  and  inflammation),  intestine  (crypt 
epithelium  single-cell  necrosis),  and  pancreas  (acinar  cell  single-cell  necrosis).    The  findings  in  the 
spleen and intestine were observed only at a dose of 15 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin and not at doses 
of 10 mg/kg or less. Single-cell necrosis in the pancreas and in the intestine was not noted in the GLP 
compliant 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in rats and the toxicologic significance of this effect in 
humans is unknown.  After a dose-free recovery period of up to 6 weeks, all findings were reversible.

Rev10.11 
Page 36/102 
 
 
 
The  single-dose  NOAEL  for  brentuximab  vedotin  and  MMAE  in  rats  was  0.5  and  0.01  mg/kg, 
respectively. 
In monkeys, microscopic pathology was not assessed after single-dose administration of brentuximab 
vedotin.  Single-dose  administration  of  brentuximab  vedotin  to  monkeys  was  tolerated  at  doses  up  to 
6 mg/kg; however the molar equivalent MMAE dose of 0.116 mg/kg was not tolerated. 
With repeat-dose administration of brentuximab vedotin, unconjugated brentuximab, and MMAE in rats 
and monkeys the principal test article-related effects of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE in both species 
included changes in the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues; in rats, but not monkeys, effects on the 
testis and liver were seen. The administration of unconjugated brentuximab at all doses was well 
tolerated, with no apparent target organ toxicity or clinically significant adverse effects.  
Myelotoxicity was the primary test article-related toxicity associated with administration of 
brentuximab vedotin and MMAE and was dose-dependent in both species. In monkeys, at 1 mg/kg 
slight bone marrow hypocellularity and very slight to moderate granulocytic/megakaryocytic 
hypercellularity was observed. The findings increased in severity with increasing doses. At 6 mg/kg 
brentuximab vedotin, slight to marked bone marrow hypocellularity and slight to marked 
megakaryocytic hypercellularity were observed. Similarly in rats, myelotoxicity was moderate to severe 
at 15 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin, minimal to marked at 5 and 10 mg/kg and absent at 0.5 mg/kg. 
Bone marrow findings were generally reversible.  
In rats, lymphoid depletion was observed in spleen only at 15 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin (single 
dose). Lymphoid depletion and reduced thymus weights were observed at 10 mg/kg, while at 5 mg/kg 
a reduction in thymus weight was detected, however, without microscopic correlates. In monkeys, 
lymphoid depletion was observed in spleen and thymus at 6 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin, accompanied 
by reductions in thymic weight in males.  
Consistent with the microscopic findings, decreases in peripheral haematology parameters were 
observed in both species. In cynomolgus, in the 11-week repeat-dose toxicology study, the 
predominant effect on haematology was a dose-dependent decrease in neutrophils. At 6 mg/kg 
brentuximab vedotin (lethal dose), neutrophils were markedly decreased 1 and 2 weeks post-dose, 
with a nadir a 2 weeks and reversibility by 3 weeks. At 3 mg/kg (HNSTD), a similar, but less severe 
cyclic decrease in neutrophil counts was observed, while at 1 mg/kg (NOAEL) no biologically relevant 
effects on neutrophil counts was observed. In addition, in this study other leukocyte, RBC and 
reticulocyte counts were variably decreased. The haematologic changes observed in the 26-week 
repeat-dose toxicity study were similar to those of the 11-week study.  
In the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats treated with brentuximab vedotin at 5 and 10 mg/kg, 
significantly reduced erythropoiesis was observed, resulting in non-regenerative anaemia. This is 
consistent with the findings of the single-dose study evaluating the kinetics of bone marrow toxicity in 
the rat, were pancytopenia (erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocytic) was evident. Within the myeloid 
lineage, neutrophils were most severely affected (up to 85% reduction in neutrophil counts). These 
data are supported by bone marrow cytology and microscopic data, demonstrating hypocellularity from 
day 1 to 5 post dose, a compensatory hyperplasia from day 5 to 12 and a return to normal by day 13. 
In this study, complete recovery of all cell lineages was evident in peripheral haematology endpoints 
and in bone marrow findings.  
Following treatment with the toxin moiety MMAE at molar equivalent doses, the myelotoxicity was 
qualitatively similar but quantitatively more severe than the toxicity observed with brentuximab 
vedotin. MMAE at 0.2 mg/kg in rats (molar equivalent of 10 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin) and at 0.116 
mg/kg (molar equivalent of 6 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin) induced mortality. Also, the microscopic 
findings in monkeys given 0.058 mg/kg MMAE were more severe than upon treatment with the 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 37/102 
Rev10.11 
 
 
 
equivalent dose of brentuximab vedotin (3 mg/kg). Thus, on an equimolar basis, MMAE appears to be 
more myelotoxic than brentuximab vedotin. This is consistent with a high peak concentration of MMAE 
following IV administration of the toxin, compared to a slower release and lower absolute peak 
concentrations of MMAE when given as antibody-drug-conjugate. Consequently, toxic effects appear to 
be more persistent in animals treated with the ADC compared to those treated with the toxin alone.  
Neutropenia and associated mortality was the clinically most significant toxicity observed in non-clinical 
studies in monkeys. Neutropenia was a relatively common treatment-emergent adverse event in 
patients. Furthermore, two treatment-related deaths in patients were associated with neutropenia and 
severe infection.  
Brentuximab vedotin and MMAE resulted in reversible, dose-dependent hepatic toxicity in rats but not 
in monkeys.  Focal hepatocellular coagulative necrosis and increases in serum hepatobiliary enzymes 
were observed in rats administered 10-mg/kg brentuximab vedotin q1wk × 4 and the molar equivalent 
dose of MMAE (0.194 mg/kg).  The hepatotoxicity noted in repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats 
seems to pose minimal risk for the intended population of patients with relapsed or refractory HL and 
sALCL, since hepatotoxicity was not noted in monkeys. However, it should be considered that MMAE 
plasma levels in patients are two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in monkeys. 
Therefore, hepatotoxicity might still be of concern. Yet, the hepatobiliary enzyme elevations were 
reversible and can be easily monitored in patients. Thus far only very few patients have shown 
moderately elevated liver enzymes. 
Brentuximab vedotin and MMAE resulted in partially reversible dose-dependent testicular toxicity in 
rats.  Degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules were observed in rats dosed with 5- and 10-
mg/kg brentuximab vedotin q1wk × 4 (at 5 mg/kg, approximately 3 times the exposure associated 
with the proposed marketed dose of 1.8 mg/kg).  Testicular toxicity was also observed with MMAE, but 
with lower potency when doses are compared on a molar basis.  Although pharmacological in vitro 
studies indicate that brentuximab vedotin does not have affinity for rat CD30, the Applicant suggests 
that besides a possible interaction of brentuximab vedotin with testicular CD30, the longer apparent 
half-life of MMAE after administration of brentuximab vedotin also may have contributed to the 
observed differential testicular toxicity of brentuximab vedotin and free MMAE. A trend toward 
reversibility of testicular toxicity was demonstrated after a 16-week recovery phase. But even after 
almost two cycles of spermatogenesis some rats still had severely affected testes.  In two out of four 
male cynomolgus monkeys administered 3 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin, minimal to slight 
hypospermatogenesis was observed. However, given the sexual immaturity of most of the monkeys 
used in the toxicological assessment of brentuximab vedotin, definitive conclusions regarding the 
potential for testicular toxicity in this species cannot be drawn. As appropriate, due warnings and 
advice are included in the SmPC. 
Although peripheral neuropathy was the most common treatment-emergent adverse effect in the 
clinic, no microscopic evidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed after 4 doses in monkeys or rats 
at systemic exposures (AUC) up to 6-fold that in humans. The Applicant reviews sporadic findings in 
the non-clinical studies that might point to neuropathy in these animals. However, as these findings 
were sporadic and no microscopic correlates were found, the Applicant concludes that in the non-
clinical species no peripheral neuropathy occurred. The reason for these species differences is not 
clear, but higher MMAE plasma levels obtained in humans may have contributed to these differences. 
As neuropathy was not identifiable as such in animals, these models do not provide a means to study 
the underlying mechanism for peripheral neuropathy as observed in humans. Nevertheless, peripheral 
neuropathy is frequently observed in humans with compounds that interact with tubulin and 
microtubules. It is assumed that with MMAE as with other compounds acting by this mechanism, the 
mode of action is interaction with tubulin.

Toxicokinetic parameters of brentuximab vedotin, TAb and MMAE after repeat-dose administration was 
generally consistent with the single-dose kinetics in animals without antihuman antibodies. Kinetic 
parameters after repeated doses in monkeys were variable, likely due to the formation of antihuman 
antibodies. Accumulation was not observed following multiple weekly doses of brentuximab vedotin in 
monkeys. This is in line with the finding in humans where minimal to no accumulation was observed 
following repeated doses every 3 weeks. Exposure ratios at the NOAEL, respectively HNSTD, of the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies were calculated in comparison to the human exposure. Exposure was 
found to be greater in animals. Basis for calculation of exposure ratios were non-clinical studies with a 
different dosing scheme than the clinical one (for Cmax data from rat study) or single dose studies 
instead of repeat-dose studies (for AUC data from rat and monkey studies). In light of the similarity of 
single and multiple dose kinetics and the life-threatening indication, calculation of exposure ratios can, 
however be accepted. 
No genotoxic potential could be demonstrated in standard genotoxicity assays. While MMAE was not 
directly mutagenic, it was associated with an increase in micronuclei formation.  MMAE induced 
predominantly the formation of centromere-positive micronuclei, consistent with aneugenic 
(chromosome lagging) micronuclear formation. This finding is not unexpected with compounds such as 
MMAE that bind tubulin, disrupt the microtubular network, and interfere with mitosis by arresting cells 
in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. 
No carcinogenicity studies, fertility and early embryonic development studies and prenatal or postnatal 
studies (including maternal function) or studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are further 
dosed and evaluated were submitted, which is acceptable as brentuximab vedotin is intended for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory HL and sALCL. With regard to fertility, the discussion 
on the effects of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE on rat testis is of relevance. The testicular toxicity 
observed is consistent with the pharmacologic disruption of microtubules by MMAE. Overall, it seems 
reasonable to assume brentuximab vedotin may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis in man. 
As the testicular toxicity observed in rats was only partially reversible after 16 weeks recovery, this 
potential risk has been reflected in the SmPC. Men being treated with this medicine are advised to 
have sperm samples frozen and stored before treatment. Men being treated with this medicine are 
advised not to father a child during treatment and for up to 6 months following the last dose. 
In rats, brentuximab vedotin was clearly embryo-foetal toxic, causing loss of almost all embryos at 3 
mg/kg and above. This toxicity is greater than the one observed with equimolar doses of MMAE. 
Considering that CD30 is strongly expressed in decidual tissue, this tissue might be the actual target 
causing embryo-foetal lethality, but a more prolonged exposure (albeit at much lower levels) to MMAE 
after administration of brentuximab vedotin as compared to exposure after administration of the free 
toxin MMAE may have contributed to the differential embryo/foetal toxicity as well. Brentuximab 
vedotin should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential 
risks to the foetus. If a pregnant woman needs to be treated she should be clearly advised on the 
potential risk to the foetus. Moreover, w omen of childbearing potential should be using two methods 
of effective contraception during treatment with brentuximab vedotin and until 30 days after 
treatment. 
With regard to immunogenicity, the lack of RAHA was unexpected. However, as discussed under 
analytical methods, it seems probable that the presence of brentuximab vedotin in the samples may 
have led to negative results for measurement of RAHA due to interference in the assay. The positive 
immunogenic responses in monkeys appeared to reduce the concentrations of brentuximab vedotin 
and TAb after multiple doses, and conversely increased the concentrations of MMAE after multiple 
doses in of the animals with high anti-brentuximab antibody (PAHA) levels. In these animals the Tmax 
for MMAE was also decreased. The precise mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear, but since 
Adcetris

Page 39/102 
 
 
 
even the higher apparent MMAE plasma levels did not cause toxicity in the monkeys and a similar 
sharp antibody-dependent increase of MMAE plasma levels was not observed in humans, this finding is 
possibly of little relevance for humans.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Toxicity of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE observed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys is consistent 
with the expected toxicity of a tubulin-binding agent, causing arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis 
especially in rapidly dividing tissues. Although results from in vitro studies indicate that brentuximab 
does not bind to rat CD30, results from repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats suggest that antibody-
mediated delivery of the toxicant to target tissues – i.e. testis and decidual tissue – cannot be 
excluded. As CD30 is expressed in decidual tissue and possibly spermatogonia/early spermatocytes 
(although human testis samples did not show cross-reactivity with brentuximab), the treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin is not compatible with pregnancy and possibly may bear a risk for infertility in 
males. 
Peripheral neuropathy is a predominant side effect in humans, but not observable in animals. It is 
assumed that with MMAE as with similar compounds, the mode of action is interaction with tubulin.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
Compliance with GCP and applicable regulations was verified by a GCP inspection for studies 
SG035-003 and SG035-004 at 2 investigator sites in the USA as well as at the sponsor site, in 
particular where it could have had an impact on the validity of the data or the ethical conduct of the 
study. The inspection focused on the verification of selected efficacy and safety data reported in the 
MAA for a sample of patients that was determined by the inspectors. Based on the documentation seen 
during the inspections, there has not been any indication that the study has not been conducted in 
accordance with established quality standards and regulations. In addition, the inspectors did not find 
any major inconsistency and did not find any indication of fraud or manipulation of documents. In 
summary, the inspection team concluded that the data presented in the clinical study reports are 
accurately described and hence the data can be considered for the evaluation of the MAA. 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. Moreover, the 
applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

In addition, the applicant supplied data specifically for brentuximab vedotin-treated HL patients who 
had not received prior ASCT due to insufficient therapeutic response to prior therapy, comorbidities, 
age, or other reasons. Fifty-nine individual patient cases have been assembled from the following 6 
sources: SG035-0001 phase 1 dose-escalating study (every 3 week dosing), n= 10; SG035-0002 
phase 1 dose-escalating study (weekly dosing), n=10; SGN35-007 phase 1 QTc study (every 3 week 
dosing at 1.8 mg/kg), n=7; Study TB-BC010088 phase 1/2 Japan-only study (every 3 week dosing at 
1.8 mg/kg), n=6; Named Patient Program Case Series 1 (every 3 week dosing at 1.8 mg/kg), n=14; 
and Named Patient Program Case Series 2 (every 3 week dosing at 1.8 mg/kg), n=12 
Efficacy data were provided from two Phase I dose escalation trials in patients with CD30 positive 
haematological malignancies and two pivotal Phase II trials, one in patients with CD30+ relapsed or 
refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplantation and the other in patients with 
refractory or relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).   
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Five clinical studies conducted in patients with HL and sALCL (with CD30-expressing tumour cells) 
provided the primary clinical pharmacology data; phase 1 studies (SG035-0001 and SG035-0002) 
investigating safety, PK, and antitumor response to SGN-35; a study to assess the effects of SGN-35 
on cardiac ventricular repolarisation (SGN35-007); and a study to determine the DDIs between 
SGN-35 and midazolam or modulators of CYP3A4 function, as well as the routes of excretion of MMAE 
(SGN35-008A). Study SGN35-008B to assess the PK of SGN-35 in patients with hepatic or renal 
impairment is still on going.  
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 41/102 
 
 
 
 
Sparse PK data from the (pivotal) phase 2 studies (SG035-0003 and SG035-0004) were also included 
in a population PK analysis. In this, a three-compartment model was used to describe the PK of ADC 
with zero order input and first-order elimination. The elimination of ADC was linked to the formation of 
MMAE through 2 pathways: direct conversion of ADC to MMAE and conversion of ADC to MMAE 
following binding to a target site. The PK of MMAE was described by a two-compartment model with 
first-order elimination and formation of MMAE both directly from ADC and through binding of ADC to a 
hypothetical target.   
Distribution 
A multi-exponential decline in SGN-35 (ADC: Antibody Drug Conjugate) serum concentrations was 
observed with a terminal half-life of approximately 4-6 days at the 1.8 mg/kg dose level (Figure 3). 
Exposures were approximately dose proportional. No accumulation was observed with multiple doses 
at the q3wk schedule. Volume of distribution of SGN-35 was approximately 6–10 l, indicating that 
SGN-35 was primarily limited to the vascular space.

Time (days)
Cycle 1
The plasma pharmacokinetics of MMAE following an intravenous dose of SGN-35 in patients with CD30-
positive hematologic malignancies appeared to be formation-limited (Figure 4). Maximum 
concentrations (5.0 ng/ml first dose) were typically observed 2 days post-dose and MMAE declined 
with an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 3-4 days at the 1.8 mg/kg dose level. Exposures 
were approximately dose proportional over the range of 0.1 – 2.7 mg/kg. MMAE AUC0-21d and Cmax 
decreased 20-50% after cycle 1 and achieved steady state thereafter.  A decrease in MMAE exposure 
was not observed when SGN-35 was administered once weekly (study SG035-0002). The cause of the 
lower systemic exposure to MMAE after multiple dosing compared to single dosing for a q3wk schedule 
is not known.

Time (days)
Cycle 1
As with ADC, maximum concentrations of Tab were typically observed at the end of infusion or the 
sampling time point closest to the end of infusion. Exposures were approximately dose proportional 
and higher than those associated with ADC. The proportion of TAb to ADC increased with time. Based 
on the proposed mechanism of action, the increase in unconjugated antibody is expected to be a result 
of drug-linker cleavage. 
The extent of SGD-1006 (the drug-linker and MMAE portion of SGN-35) transfer from SGN-35 to 
plasma proteins in humans administered SGN-35 was determined. The extent of drug linker transfer 
from SGN-35 to plasma proteins (albumin) was minimal with transferred drug linker being 
approximately 1.5% of the circulating conjugated and unconjugated MMAE in plasma. 
Elimination 
In study SGN35-008A, metabolism and excretion of MMAE was investigated in 12 subjects of whom 8 
subjects had adequate urine and faeces sampling following SGN-35 administration cycle 1. Excretion of 
MMAE was followed for 7 days after administration of SGN-35. Approximately 23.5% of the MMAE 
received was recovered in both urine and faeces over a 1-week period. Of the MMAE recovered, the 
median percentage of MMAE excreted in feces was 72% (range, 59% to 77%), with the remainder 
excreted in urine. In the same study, metabolites of MMAE were analysed in urine and faeces. MMAE 
was the only observed species in unconcentrated urine and feces bulk pools. In urine and feces bulk 
pools concentrated ten-fold, 8 human metabolites of MMAE were observed. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Two dose escalating studies were conducted in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive 
hematologic malignancies:  
Study SG035-0001: 0.1 mg/kg -3.6 mg/kg SGN-35 iv, every 3 weeks. The pharmacokinetics of 
SGN-35 were best characterized at the 1.8 and 2.7 mg/kg dose levels, with 12 patients at each of 
those dose levels for the first cycle of dosing. 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 43/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increases in SGN-35 ADC exposure were approximately dose proportional.  First dose geometric mean 
terminal half-life was between 4 and 6 days for the 1.8 and 2.7 mg/kg dose levels.  Median time to 
maximum concentration (Tmax) typically occurred immediately after the end of the infusion 
(approximately 0.089 to 0.094 days for the 1.8 and 2.7 mg/kg dose levels).   
Increases in MMAE were approximately dose proportional.  First dose apparent terminal half-life was 
between 3 and 4 days for the 1.8 and 2.7 mg/kg dose levels, and median Tmax occurred approximately 
2 days postdose for the 1.8 mg/kg dose and approximately 3 days postdose for the 2.7 mg/kg dose. 
No accumulation was detected for ADC at the 1.8 mg/kg dose consistent with the half-life estimate.  
The observed Cycle 2/Cycle 1 and Cycle 3/Cycle 1 geometric mean ratio (GMR) for AUC0-21d ranged 
from 0.93 to 1.24, and the observed Cmax GMR ranged from 0.73 to 1.11. 
MMAE AUC0-21d and Cmax decreased following multiple doses (data not shown).   
Study SG035-002: 0.4 mg/kg – 1.4 mg/kg SGN-35 (IV, weekly, first 3 weeks of every 4-week cycle). 
Pharmacokinetics were best characterised at the 1.0 and 1.2 mg/kg dose levels, with 12 patients at 
each of those dose levels. 
ADC exposure was approximately dose-proportional over the range 0.4 -1.4 mg/kg SGN-35 (IV, 
weekly, first 3 weeks of every 4-week cycle) by visual inspection. For MMAE, variability was rather high 
making the dose proportionality less clear. 
Following a weekly administration (first 3 weeks of every 4-week cycle), the accumulation of ADC and 
MMAE was moderate.  The intra- and inter-cycle accumulation ratio for ADC was approximately 1.72 at 
1.0 mg/kg and 1.28 at 1.2 mg/kg.  For MMAE, accumulation was modest; the intra- and intercycle 
accumulation ratio was approximately 1.09 at 1.0 mg/kg and 1.17 at 1.2 mg/kg. 
Special populations 
Evaluation of pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE in special populations has been based on population 
PK analysis. The effects of gender, age, race, weight, body surface area, and disease (HL, sALCL, or 
other) on the PK of SGN-35 and MMAE were evaluated using a population PK approach. A three-
compartment model was used to describe the PK of ADC with zero order input and first-order 
elimination. The elimination of ADC was linked to the formation of MMAE through 2 pathways: direct 
conversion of ADC to MMAE and conversion of ADC to MMAE following binding to a target site. The PK 
of MMAE was described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination and formation of 
MMAE both directly from ADC and through binding of ADC to a hypothetical target.  A conventional 
phase 1 study is ongoing to examine the effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE. 
Weight was a clinically meaningful covariate for ADC and MMAE pharmacokinetics. For the range of 
weights in the current analysis (41 to 168 kg), this would result in a 32% lower to 87% higher 
clearance for the range of weights compared to a 70-kg individual. The recommended dose is weight-
based (1.8 mg/kg) but with a maximum of 180 mg.    
Age was not a significant covariate in the ADC and MMAE population PK model. No dose adjustment is 
recommended based on age for adults.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro assays indicated that MMAE is metabolised by CYP3A4 and that MMAE has the potential to be a 
mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (see non-clinical pharmacokinetics section). Based on this 
information, study SGN35-008A was designed to determine the potential for CYP3A4-mediated DDIs

between SGN-35 and various drugs known to be metabolized by CYP3A4 or to affect CYP3A4 activity. 
Drug-drug interactions with rifampicin and ketoconazole decreased MMAE exposure with 31% and 
increased MMAE exposure with 73%, respectively. These data are consistent with a slow turnover of 
MMAE by CYP3A4. Rifampicin and ketoconazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of SGN-35. Co-
administration of midazolam with SGN-35 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, 
indicating that SGN-35 and MMAE do not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo. The incidence of neutropenia grade 3 
or higher was increased in the presence of ketoconazole. The wording in SmPC in section 4.5 warns 
appropriately for potential increase in neutropenia due to increased concentrations of MMAE in the 
presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Please refer to the non-clinical pharmacokinetics section. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A QT/QTc prolongation study indicated that there was no clinically significant change from baseline in 
the duration of ventricular repolarisation as measured by QTcF in patients treated with SGN-35, and 
that there was no significant relationship between plasma MMAE concentrations and changes in QTcF 
from baseline to Cycle 1 and Cycle 3, Days 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Five clinical studies conducted in patients with HL and sALCL (with CD30-expressing tumour cells) 
provided the primary clinical pharmacology data. Pharmacokinetics of SGN-35 was consistent with 
other monoclonal antibody products. In agreement with the effect of weight on the pharmacokinetics 
of SGN-35, the recommended dosing is 1.8 mg/kg. However, a maximal dose of 180 mg is 
recommended. Due to capping of the SGN-35 dose, exposure to ADC did not continue to increase in 
patients > 100 kg but decreased to level <70 kg. In contrast, MMAE AUC continued to increase in 
patients >100 kg. This results is a different ADC/MMAE ratio in patients >100 kg. Adcetris dosing was 
capped at 100 kg in clinical trials. This was not based on PK data but based on experience with other 
mAbs that as an obese individual is less vascularised per kg body weight than a lean individual, this 
may lead to over-compensation for increasing body weight. Efficacy parameters did not show 
statistically significant differences by patients’ weight. The incidence of diarrhoea and fatigue appear 
increased in patients weighing >100 kg, but these adverse events have not been shown to correlate 
well with MMAE plasma concentrations in the dose finding studies. The incidence of neutropenia, which 
is correlated with SGN-35 and MMAE concentrations was not increased in patients >100 kg. Although 
there are no strong signals that the benefit risk balance is different in patients > 100 kg, the number 
of patients >100 kg was low and an updated efficacy and safety analysis from study SG035-0003 and 
SG035-0004 should be submitted when finalised.  
Pharmacokinetics of MMAE appeared to be formation limited. Upon multiple dosing, exposure to MMAE 
was lower compared to the first dose. Population PK analysis showed that baseline serum albumin 
concentration was a significant covariate of MMAE clearance. The analysis indicated that MMAE 
clearance was 2-fold lower in patients with low serum albumin concentrations <3.0 g/dl compared with 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 45/102 
Rev10.11 
 
 
 
patients with serum albumin concentrations within the normal range. As binding of MMAE to plasma 
proteins is moderate, the large impact of albumin on the pharmacokinetics of MMAE was unexpected. 
The incidence of neutropenia was slightly higher in subjects with albumin concentration <3.0 g/dl. 
However, as SGN-35 pharmacokinetics is not affected by albumin concentration, a priori dose 
modification based on albumin concentration is not justified as this would lower the SGN-35 exposure 
and may affect the efficacy.  
MMAE is slowly metabolised by CYP3A4 but is mainly excreted unchanged. The fate of MMAE is not 
clear. Recovery of MMAE in the mass balance study (23.5%) was much lower than expected from the 
PK of MMAE. This may be due to the fact that only unchanged MMAE was measured. Furthermore, 
exposure to MMAE was lower in the second cycle compared to the first cycle but the cause for this is 
not known. The role of active metabolites is unclear. Given the importance of MMAE (and potentially 
some of its metabolites) for the toxicity of brentuximan vedotin, the applicant will further investigate 
MMAE metabolism in a phase 1 study which has been included as an additional pharmacovigilance 
activity in the RMP. Similarly, hepatic and renal impairment may affect the elimination of MMAE. This is 
currently under investigation in study SGN35-0008b. The report should be submitted as soon as the 
study is finalised. 
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, 
increased the exposure to the antimicrotubule agent MMAE by approximately 73%, and did not alter 
the plasma exposure to brentuximab vedotin. Therefore, co-administration of brentuximab vedotin 
with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors may increase the incidence of neutropenia. If neutropenia 
develops, the dose of brentuximab vedotin should be adjusted as described in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, did not alter the 
plasma exposure to brentuximab vedotin; however it reduced exposure to MMAE by approximately 
31%. Co-administration of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, with brentuximab vedotin did not alter the 
metabolism of midazolam; therefore brentuximab vedotin is not expected to alter the exposure to 
medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes. 
In terms of pharmacodynamic drug interactions, it is known from clinical studies outside the claimed 
indication that combined use of bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin causes pulmonary toxicity (data 
not shown) and the concurrent use of the two is contraindicated. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacology of SGN-35, including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADC and MMAE has 
been sufficiently characterised but additional efficacy data in patients >100 kg are awaited which will 
inform the recommendation for dose capping in these patients. The fate of MMAE and the importance 
of active metabolites need further investigation and the applicant will submit the results of a phase 1 
study to explore the levels of some of the metabolites in the patients’ blood and urine samples.  
Hepatic and renal impairment may also affect the elimination of MMAE. This is currently under 
investigation in study SGN35-0008b. The results should be submitted when available (see also 
Pharmacovigilance section).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study SG035-0001 was a phase I dose-escalation study of SGN-35 in ptients with relapsed/refractory 
CD30-positive haematologic malignancies. Repeated doses of SGN-35 administered every 3 weeks 
were generally well-tolerated up to 1.8 mg/kg, the dose determined to be the MTD in the study based 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 46/102 
 
 
 
on protocol-defined DLTs.  Both the 1.8 mg/kg and the 2.7 mg/kg cohorts were expanded to 12 
patients based on the occurrence of 1 DLT in the initial 6 patients enrolled to each cohort and 
subsequent to the enrolment of a single patient at 3.6 mg/kg who experienced a Grade 5 (fatal) febrile 
neutropenia and septic shock (presumed, all cultures negative for microbial findings) and died 14 days 
after receiving the dose. No additional DLT occurred in the expanded 1.8 mg/kg cohort and 3 DLTs 
occurred in 2 patients in the expanded 2.7 mg/kg cohort. Additionally, events of peripheral neuropathy 
and neutropenia generally occurred less frequently and were less severe in patients receiving 1.8 
mg/kg compared with those receiving 2.7 mg/kg. Fewer treatment discontinuations or modifications 
due to neutropenia occurred in patients receiving 1.8 mg/kg compared with those receiving 2.7 mg/kg. 
Pharmacokinetics was best defined at the 1.8 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg doses (all other dose cohorts had 
3 or 4 patients each). No accumulation of SGN-35 was detected at 1.8 mg/kg and slight accumulation 
was observed at 2.7 mg/kg. Objective response rate in HL patients in the 1.8 mg/kg cohort was 50% 
(6 of 12 patients) and in the 2.7 mg/kg cohort was 55% (6 of 11 patients).  
Study SG035-0002 was a phase I dose-escalation study of weekly SGN-35 alone and in combination 
with gemcitabine in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive haematologic malignancies. This 
study employed a more frequent dosing schedule. In this Study, SGN-35 was administered weekly for 
3 out of 4 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days). At this schedule, the MTD was determined to be 
1.2 mg/kg based on dose limiting toxicities as defined by the protocol. After the monotherapy cohorts 
in the study were enrolled, the emergence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy (sensory with some 
motor) in 14% of patients with continued dosing (median time to onset, 25.9 weeks) resulted in a 
protocol amendment to reduce dose frequency specific to time on study treatment. Moderate 
accumulation was observed for SGN-35 and MMAE. The objective response rate in the 1.2 mg/kg 
cohort was 58% (7 of 12 patients).  
2.5.2.  Main studies  
SG035-003 
This was a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory HL. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible patients had relapsed or refractory HL, had previously received an autologous stem cell 
transplant (ASCT), and had histologically-documented CD30-positive disease by central review. 
Patients were required to have fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease by PET and measurable disease 
of at least 1.5 cm by spiral CT. At US sites, patients were to be age 12 years or older. At non-US sites, 
patients were to be age 18 years or older. Amongst other exclusion criteria, patients could not 
previously have been treated with brentuximab vedotin or received an allogeneic transplant. Patients 
with congestive heart failure or known cerebral/meningeal disease were also excluded. 
Treatments 
Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg was to be administered via outpatient intravenous (IV) infusion on 
Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Dose delays (up to 3 weeks each) and a one-level dose reduction to 
1.2 mg/kg were allowed for toxicities. Patients could continue on study treatment until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieved stable disease or better were to receive a 
minimum of 8, but no more than 16 cycles of study treatment.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the antitumor efficacy of single-agent brentuximab vedotin 
(1.8 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) as measured by the overall objective response 
rate in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma following autologous stem cell 
transplant. 
Secondary Objectives were to assess duration of tumour control, including duration of response and 
progression-free survival, to assess survival, to assess the safety and tolerability of brentuximab 
vedotin and to assess the pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin. 
Additional objectives were to assess disease-related symptoms as well as to explore the correlation of 
potential biomarkers with clinical outcomes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the overall objective response rate (ORR) per an independent review 
facility (IRF). Treatment response was assessed by spiral CT of the chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis 
and PET scans. Determination of antitumour efficacy was based on objective response assessments 
made according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007), which 
includes radiographic disease assessment by computed tomography (CT) and/or positron emission 
tomography (PET) scans and oncology review of clinical data. Clinical response of progressive disease 
(PD), stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR), or complete remission (CR) was to be determined at 
each assessment. Treatment decisions were based on investigator assessment of response. 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from 
start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumour progression or to death due to any 
cause. Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the date of 
death due to any cause. 
Other efficacy parameters included Maximum Tumour Reduction for which descriptive statistics were 
generated based on the sum of the product diameters of target lesions at baseline, the minimum post-
baseline SPD, and maximum percent observed reduction from baseline. The percentage of patients 
with any reduction from baseline was also generated. Regarding duration of response, this was defined 
as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumour response (CR or PR) to the first 
subsequent documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause. B-symptom 
resolution was defined as the proportion of patients with lymphoma-related B symptom(s) at baseline 
who achieve resolution of all B symptoms at any time during the treatment period. B symptoms were 
defined as fever, night sweats, or weight loss >10%. PFS by best clinical response and EFS (with 
disease progression based on investigator’s assessment) was defined as the time from start of study 
treatment to any treatment failure including treatment discontinuation due to toxicity or patient 
decision, initiation of a new treatment other than stem cell transplant without documented progression, 
disease progression, or death. 
Sample size 
It was planned to enrol 100 patients in the study. If the true objective response rate would be at least 
35% with a sample size of 100 subjects a 2-sided binomial test for α = 0.05 would have about 90% 
power to exclude an ORR less than 20%.

Statistical methods 
An  exact  95%  confidence  interval  was  used  to  test  the  null-hypothesis  that  ORR  according  IRF  for 
SGN035 was <20% vs. the alternative that ORR was ≥20%.  
Categorical  data  were  described  by  (absolute  and  relative)  frequencies  including  the  corresponding 
95%confidence  intervals.  Kaplan-Meier  plots  and  estimates  were  used  to  assess  time  to  event  data. 
Continuous data were described by statistical characteristics (mean, sd, median, min, max).   
An  independent  data  monitoring  committee  only  reviewed  the  data  for  safety.  No  interim  analysis  to 
stop the study was planned.

Two IDMC meetings were  convened during the study as planned;  however the actual timing of these 
meetings was different from that prespecified in the protocol and IDMC charter. Per the IDMC charter, 
the  first  IDMC  meeting  was  to  be  scheduled  approximately  1  month  after  the  30th  patient  had 
completed  Cycle  2.  Based  on  projected  enrollment,  the  first  meeting  was  scheduled  for  27  August 
2009.  Because  of  more  rapid  than  anticipated  patient  accrual,  at  the  time  of  data-cut  for  the  IDMC 
report  (10  August  2009),  95  patients  had  been  enrolled  and  Cycle  2  restage  data  were  available  for 
49 patients.  At  the  time  of  the  first  IDMC  meeting,  all  102  patients  had  been  enrolled  and  the  study 
was closed to enrollment. The second IDMC meeting was held on 28 March 2010. With agreement from 
the IDMC members, this date was selected to facilitate review of data from both the current study and 
study SG035-0004. 
The definition of a protocol deviation/major protocol deviation as specified in the SAP was revised. For 
the purposes of this study, 2 categories of protocol variance were defined and used: 
 
 
Protocol  deviation  -  defined  as  an  incident  involving  non-compliance  with  the  clinical  protocol 
that  does  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  subject’s  rights,  safety,  or  welfare,  or  on  the 
integrity of the resultant data. 
Protocol  violation  (major  protocol  deviation)  -  defined  as  a  divergence  from  the  protocol  that 
has  a  significant  effect  on  the  subject’s  rights,  safety,  or  welfare,  or  on  the  integrity  of  the 
resultant data. 
40%  of  the  patients  had  protocol  violations.  Amongst  the  protocol  violations,  drug  administration 
violation was reported in 7 patients:  
- 3 patients received a 10-13% lower dose (for 1 cycle: n=2; for 6 cycle: n=1) 
- 4 patients received a higher dose (+32% for 2 cycle; +18% for 2/14 cycles; +17% for 1/13 cycles; 
+50% for 1/4 cycles) 
Study conduct violations related to the conduct of restage assessments were reported for 26 patients. 
PET  and  /or  CT  assessments  were  not  done  or  were  performed  out  of  window  for  18  patients.  Some 
assessments for the remaining 8 patients lacked diagnostic quality. 
The following changes were made to the Planned Efficacy Analyses: 
Additional  subgroups  that  were  analyzed  included:  relapsed  versus  refractory  disease,  primary 
refractory  disease  versus  non  primary  refractory  disease,  bone  marrow  involvement  at  baseline, 
baseline  SPD,  patients  who  received  a  stem  cell  transplant  after  treatment  with  brentuximab  vedotin 
(allogeneic or autologous) 
The  age  subgroup  was  adjusted  to  reflect  the  definition  of  the  geriatric  population  provided  in  ICH 
guidance documents. The revised age categories are: 12-17 years, 18-64 years, and ≥65 years. 
A  kappa  coefficient  was  calculated  to  characteriSe  the  difference  in  objective  response  and  best 
response assessments between IRF and investigator. 
Pearson’s  correlation  was  used  to  assess  the  association  of  the  maximum  percent  reduction  from 
baseline in SPD by IRF with that by investigator. 
A  comparison  of  intrapatient  PFS  (prior  vs.  current  study)  was  preplanned  before  any  patients  were 
enrolled.  The  methodology  of  this  preplanned  analysis  was  subsequently  clarified  to  use  a  correlated 
survival analysis (Lin 1989).

Numbers analysed 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all 102 patients enrolled in the study. The  ITT analysis 
set was to be used for the primary efficacy analysis. Secondary and additional efficacy endpoints were 
also to be analysed using this analysis set. 
The per-protocol analysis set was defined as those patients who satisfied the following criteria: 
 
 
 
 
received at least 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin 
had measurable disease at baseline 
had the correct histological cancer type per central pathology review 
had no other major protocol deviations that could potentially affect tumor response 
The  per-protocol  analysis  set  was  to  be  used  for  secondary  analyses  of  all  efficacy  endpoints.  In  this 
study, the per-protocol analysis set comprises 99 patients; 3 patients were excluded from this analysis 
set because they did not have measurable disease at baseline per IRF assessment.

Outcomes and estimation 
Based on the most updated efficacy results with an 1 August 2011 (2 April 2012 for OS) cut off date, 
the following results were reported: 
- the ORR was 75% (76/102), with a CR rate of 33% (34/102), by IRF analysis 
- the estimated median duration of response per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 6.7 months [95% 
CI (3.6, 14.8)] (range 1.2 to 26.1 months). 
- the median duration of response in patients with CR has not been reached [95% CI (10.8, -)]; the 
current duration of response ranges from 1.4 to 26.1 months. 
- the estimated median PFS per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 5.6 months [95% CI (5.0, 9.0 
months)] (range, 1.2 to 27.3 months). 
- at the time of the last analysis (2 April 2012), 40 of 102 patients were known to have died. The 
median overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier analysis has not been reached [95% CI (27, – months)]. 
Ancillary analyses 
PFS and estimated OS per IRF were analysed per type of response. Both PFS and OS correlated 
positively with response to brentuximab-vedotin as defined by CR, PR, SD and PD (data not shown). 
The applicant also compared investigator-based PFS after brentuximab vedotin to PFS after last 
chemotherapy depending on whether ASCT had been one of the prior therapies (but not the latest 
one). The applicant also compared PFS after brentuximab depending on whether the latest prior 
therapy was ASCT or systemic chemotherapy. No meaningful differences were noted (data not shown). 
A difference was shown in terms of IRF-based PFS between patients who received brentuximab vedotin 
as first line of therapy post-ASCT showing a CR compared to patients who received brentuximab 
vedotin after one or more systemic chemotherapies post-ASCT showing a CR (data not shown). 
Furthermore, the applicant provided an intra-individual comparison of investigator-based PFS after 
brentuximab-vedotin with investigator-based PFS after the most recent prior therapy. An equal to 
longer PFS as compared to the last chemotherapy was seen in 59% (60/102) of the HL patients (data 
not shown). 
Finally, the applicant submitted a meta-analysis of the literature as an external control to compare the 
efficacy of SGN-35 to that of gemcitabine and its combination regimens in the relapsed/refractory HL 
setting. CR rate was used as the endpoint for analysis. Separate analyses were submitted for 
studies/case series that included at least a third of enrolled patients with a prior transplant and those 
that included transplant-naïve patients. The overall CR rate for gemcitabine in the studies where 
patients were included who had received prior ASCT was 15%, compared to 34% after Adcetris. In the 
studies where patients had not received prior transplant the CR rate was 35%, but the median number 
of prior treatments was 1, compared with 3.5 in the Adcetris study (data not shown).  
SG035-0004 
This was a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible patients had relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL, had received front-line chemotherapy with 
curative intent, and had histologically-documented CD30-positive disease. Patients were required to 
have fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease by PET and measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm by 
spiral computed tomography (CT). At US and Canadian sites, patients were to be age 12 years or 
older. At European sites, patients were to be age 18 years or older. Documented anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) status was required. 
Amongst other exclusion criteria, patients could not previously have been treated with brentuximab 
vedotin or received an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). Patients with current diagnosis of primary 
cutaneous ALCL were also excluded; however patients who have transformed to systemic ALCL were 
eligible. 
Treatments 
Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg was administered via outpatient intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle. Dose delays (up to 3 weeks each) and a one-level dose reduction to 1.2 mg/kg 
were allowed for toxicities. Patients could continue on study treatment until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieved stable disease or better were to receive a minimum of 8, 
but no more than 16 cycles of study treatment.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the antitumour efficacy of single-agent brentuximab vedotin 
(1.8 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) as measured by the overall objective response 
rate in patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma following front line 
chemotherapy (CHOP or equivalent). 
Secondary objectives were to assess duration of tumour control, including duration of response and 
progression-free survival, to assess survival, to assess the safety and tolerability of brentuximab 
vedotin and to assess the pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin. 
Additional objectives were to assess disease-related symptoms as well as to explore the correlation of 
potential biomarkers with clinical outcomes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the overall ORR per IRF. Treatment response was assessed by spiral 
CT of chest, neck, abdomen, pelvis and PET scans. Determination of antitumour efficacy was based on 
objective response assessments made according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007). Clinical response of progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), 
partial remission (PR), or complete remission (CR) was to be determined at each assessment. 
Responses were determined by an independent review facility (IRF) and treatment decisions were 
made based on investigator assessment of response. Enrolled patients who were later determined to 
have the incorrect histological cancer type upon review were to be scored as non-responders for 
calculating the ORR.  
Secondary endpoints were Duration of Response (DoR) per IRF, Complete Remission (CR) Rate per 
IRF, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per IRF and OS.

Sample size 
It was planned to enrol 55 patients in the study. If the true objective response rate would be at least 
50%,  with  a  sample  size  of  55  patients  a  2-sided  binomial  test  for  α  =  0.05  would  have  more  than 
95% power to exclude an ORR less than 20%.

An  exact  95%  confidence  interval  was  used  to  test  the  null-hypothesis  that  ORR  according  IRF  for 
SGN035 was < 20% vs. the alternative that ORR is ≥ 20%.  
Categorical  data  were  described  by  (absolute  and  relative)  frequencies  including  the  corresponding 
95%  confidence  intervals.  Kaplan-Meier  plots  and  estimates  were  used  to  assess  time  to  event  data. 
Continuous data were described by statistical characteristics (mean, sd, median, min, max).   
An independent data monitoring committee only reviewed to the data for safety. No interim analysis to 
stop the study was planned.

The definition of a protocol deviation/major protocol deviation as specified in the SAP was revised. For 
the purposes of this study, 2 categories of protocol variance were defined and used: 
 
Protocol  deviation:  Defined  as  an  incident  involving  non-compliance  with  the  clinical  protocol 
that  does  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  subject’s  rights,  safety,  or  welfare,  or  on  the 
integrity of the resultant data. 
  Major  protocol  deviation  (protocol  violation):  Defined  as  a  divergence  from  the  protocol  that 
has  a  significant  effect  on  the  subject’s  rights,  safety,  or  welfare,  or  on  the  integrity  of  the 
resultant data.

Numbers analysed 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all 58 patients enrolled in the study and it was used for 
the primary efficacy analysis. Secondary and additional efficacy endpoints were also analysed using 
this analysis set. 
The per-protocol analysis set was defined as those patients who satisfied the following criteria: 
 
 
 
 
received at least 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin 
had measurable disease at baseline 
had the correct histological cancer type per central pathology review 
had no other major protocol deviations that could potentially affect tumor response 
The per-protocol analysis set was used for secondary analyses of all efficacy endpoints. 
The per-protocol set comprised 55 patients; 2 patients did not have the correct histological cancer type 
per central pathology review. The last patient not included in the per-protocol set was deemed to have 
protocol deviations that potentially affected tumour response (ECOG PS 2 at baseline).

Outcomes and estimation 
Based on the most updated efficacy results with a 13 July 2011 (2 April 2012 for OS) cut off date, the 
following results were reported: 
- the ORR was 86% (50/58) with a CR rate of 59% (34/58) 
- the estimated median duration of response per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 13.2 months [95% 
CI (5.7,-)] (range, 0.1 to 21.7 months). Of the 50 patients who had an objective response, 27 have 
had disease progression or have died. 
- among patients who achieved a best response of CR, the estimated median duration of response per 
IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was not reached [95% CI (13.0 months, -)] (range, 0.7 to 21.7 months). 
Of the 34 patients who had a CR, 13 have had disease progression or have died. 
- the estimated median PFS per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 14.3 months [95% CI (6.9,-)] 
(range, 0.8 to 23.6 months). 
- at the time of the last analysis (2 April 2012), 21 of 58 patients were known to have died. The 
median overall survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis was not reached [95% CI ( 21.3 , - )]. The estimated 
overall survival rate at 12 months was 71% [95% CI (57, 80)]. 
Ancillary analyses 
PFS per IRF and the estimated OS per IRF, respectively, correlated positively with response to 
brentuximab-vedotin as defined by CR, PR, SD and PD (data not shown). 
Furthermore, the intra-individual comparison of investigator-based PFS after brentuximab-vedotin to 
investigator-based PFS after the most recent prior therapy showed plot shows that brentuximab-
vedotin induced an equal to longer PFS as compared to the last chemotherapy in 60% (35/58) of the 
sALCL patients (data not shown).  
The applicant also submitted a meta-analysis of studies in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) that included sALCL patients. However, only a small proportion of all patients had 
ALCL, ranging from 1.6% to 20.8%, and in most reports the results were not specified by histological 
tumour type. Only a few of the publications indicated the specific outcome, mainly response, of sALCL 
patients (data not shown).

With regard to the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients without prior ASCT, the applicant 
presented data derived from 59 patients who had not undergone ASCT and received 1 or more doses 
of brentuximab vedotin. These patients came the phase I/II studies, a Japanese-only study (TB-
BC010088) and Named Patient Programmes (NPPs). Of these 59 patients, 41 received 1.8 mg/kg 
brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks, the dose and regimen used in pivotal HL Study SG035-0003 and 
proposed for marketing authorisation. 3 patients received only 1 therapy prior to administration of 
brentuximab, hence the total number of patients fitting the proposed indication was 56, 40 of which 
were treated according to the applied for schedule of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin every three 
weeks.  
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics for these 59 patients are summarised in the following 
Tables 20 and 21. The exclusion of the 3 above mentioned patients on the reported data led to small 
adjustments of the reported data.

refractory HL without prior ASCT

Rev10.11 
Page 66/102 
 
 
 
 
Table 21: Disease characteristics of prognostic importance for the 59-patient population 
with relapsed or refractory HL without prior ASCT 
Patients’ most common first line of prior therapy was doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and 
dacarbazine (ABVD). Of the 56 no-prior-ASCT patients, 64% of the patients (was 66% with n=59) 
received the same first line of therapy, i.e. ABVD. The next most common frontline treatment was a 
BEACOPP-based regimen (6 patients, 11% (was 10% with n=59)). The most common second-line 
therapy among no-prior-ASCT patients was etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and 
cisplatinum (ESHAP) as received by 11 of the 56 patients (20%; was 19% with n=59); 10 of 56 
patients (18%; was 17% with n=59) received radiotherapy as second-line therapy; and 8 of 56 
patients 14% received ICE (was 13.5% with n=59). 
Response data among the 59 patients without prior ASCT are summarised in the following Table 22. 
Table 22: Response data for HL patients with relapsed or refractory HL without prior ASCT 
The  applicant  provided  very  limited  PFS  and/or  OS  data  in  the  case  reports,  i.e.  from  18/56  patients 
fitting the proposed indication (or 20 of all patients (n=59)). These data were derived from the phase I 
studies,  meaning  that  from  these  20  patients,  2  patients  received  brentuximab  vedotin  according  to 
the schedule as proposed in this MAA. From another 12 patients, PFS and/or OS could be calculated on 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 67/102 
 
 
 
 
 
the basis of the date of start of therapy, date of relapse or date of patient death. Together, these data 
are not sufficient to be used for assessment at this time. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Data from two supportive studies and two pivotal studies –one for each proposed indication- have been 
submitted to support the efficacy of Adcetris in the two indications applied for. From the dose-
escalation studies, 1.8 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks was selected as the recommended Phase 2 
dose and this dose was supported by the DLT data, adverse event profile and PK data. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal studies were phase II uncontrolled single arm trials. Patients with relapsed or refractory 
CD30+ HL who had received autologous stem cell transplantation and patients with relapsed or 
refractory ALCL who had received front-line chemotherapy with curative intent, respectively, were to 
receive 1.8 mg/kg of the drug administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients could continue on 
study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Patients who achieved 
stable disease or better were to receive a minimum of 8, but no more than 16 cycles of study 
treatment. Primary endpoint was overall response rate, defined as rates of complete remission and 
partial remission combined. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free 
survival, overall survival, event-free survival.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The Applicant has claimed that there is efficacy in terms of ORR, the median PFS and estimated OS in 
view of the limited treatment options for the stages of diseases HL and sALCL in which brentuximab-
vedotin  is  studied.  However,  additional  study  of  literature  has  shown  that  these  results  may  also  be 
achieved  with  conventional  non-CD30  directed  chemotherapy,  in  particular  concerning  the  OS  results 
in the sALCL population as studied. Since no comparative study has been pursued, uncertainty remains 
concerning the interpretation of the reported efficacy data and the validity of historical comparisons.  
The median overall survival (OS) in the Hodgkin lymphoma population and in the sALCL population has 
not been reached. However, an OS plateau was observed in the sALCL study population and possibly 
as well in the HL study population (cut of date 2 April 2012). This suggests maturity of the OS results 
at least in the sALCL study population, although definitive conclusions can not be drawn yet.  
When  optimal  treatment  is  given  to  patients,  any  next  line  therapy  usually  results  in  lower  efficacy, 
both in relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL. In contrast, the comparison of the PFS results as obtained 
with brentuximab vedotin to those after the previous line of treatment suggested an important clinical 
benefit  despite  the  fact  that  analysis  of  these  data  was  investigator-based  and  not  IRF-based.  This 
benefit may be explained by the alternative working mechanism: a CD30-guided anti-tubulin cytotoxic 
compound.  This  working  mechanism  may  provide  an  alternative  approach  to  stabilise  these 
malignancies, or even to reach a condition that allows ASCT, when this was not possible at an earlier 
stage. 
Thus, the anti-tumour effect (in terms of ORR) and the efficacy (PFS and OS) of brentuximab-vedotin 
have been shown in the HL and sALCL pivotal study populations. However, the comparative benefit of 
brentuximab-vedotin  has  not  been  clearly  established  based  on  the  uncontrolled  trial  and  historical 
comparisons presented.  
From  the  provided  information  in  the  detailed  case  reports  of  56  patients  fulfilling  the  proposed 
indication for the no-ASCT/no multi-drug chemotherapy HL patient group, it is not clear which methods 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 68/102 
 
 
 
were  used  to  asses  therapy  responses  and  AEs.  This  is  in  particular  relevant  for  the  data  of  the 
patients  participating  in  the  NNPs  as  the  results  from  the  other  included  studies  have  been  obtained 
according to GCP standards. In view of this and together with the fact that the Japan-only study (TB-
BC010088)  has  only  recently  started  with  all  6  patients  still  on  brentuximab  vedotin  treatment,  the 
data from the phase I/II studies (i.e. SG035-0001/0002) and from the SGN35-007 study (i.e. a phase 
I QTc study) acted as the basis for the assessment. The results from Japan-only studies and the NPPs 
are  considered  to  be  supportive,  in  particular  the  latter  as  these  are  more  mature  and  illustrate  the 
day-to-day clinical applicability of brentuximab vedotin. In addition, the applicant provided very limited 
PFS/OS data in the case reports, i.e. from 18 out of the 56 patients that fulfil the proposed indication. 
From  another  12  patients,  PFS  and/or  OS  could  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  date  of  start  of 
therapy, date of relapse or date of patient death. Together, this illustrates that the data are obtained 
from  a  very  heterogeneous  set  of  patients,  were  in  several  aspects  immature  and  limited,  but  still 
contained useful information.   
The  results  showed  that  the  overall  response  rate,  the  extent  of  the  response  and  the  percentage  of 
patients  that  become  eligible  for  transplantation  are  currently  the  most  important  read-outs  for  the 
anti-tumour activity of brentuximab-vedotin in this no-ASCT patient population. Regarding the overall 
response,  this  seemed  lower  as  compared  to  the  results  as  observed  in  the  study  SG035-0003, 
regardless of dose and schedule (46% ORR for all no-prior-ASCT patients, 55% ORR for proposed dose 
and schedule no-prior-ASCT patients versus 75% ORR for study SG035-0003 patients). This was true 
for CR rates as well (18% CR for all no-prior-ASCT patients, 23% CR for proposed dose and schedule 
no-prior-ASCT patients versus 33% CR for study SG035-0003 patients).  
The  applicant  explained  the generally  lower  response  rate  by,  amongst  others,  referring  to  the  lower 
exposure of the no-ASCT patient population. However, it may also be explained by intrinsic, biological 
variances  not  based  on  CD30  antigen  expression  (as  this  is  similar  and  not  subject  to  change  upon 
therapy),  but  on  absolute  or  relative  differences  in  the  involved  intracellular  signalling  pathways 
downstream of CD30 internalisation.  
Furthermore,  non-eligibility  for  ASCT  may  have  various  reasons  including  poor  response  to  previous 
chemotherapy, co-morbidity or age. Therefore, an ORR of 55% and a CR of 23% for the proposed dose 
and schedule in this patient group not suitable for ASCT may be considered clinically relevant in itself. 
In  the  NPP  population  only,  that  is  considered  to  reflect  day-to-day  clinical  practice,  these  response 
rates  are  similar.  However,  the  percentage  of  patients  that  have  become  eligible  for  stem  cell 
transplantation,  i.e.  20%  for  the  proposed  dose  and  schedule  patient  group  (n=40)  and  27%  when 
including only NPPs patients (n=26), is even more important, especially considering the absence of the 
possibility  to  apply  this  potentially  curative  therapy  at  an  earlier  stage  in  the  treatment  of  this 
particular patient group. Finally, the provided PFS/OS data in these patients are considered too limited 
at this time to be evaluated. 
Additional expert consultations 
A Scientific Advisory Groupo (SAG)-Oncology was convened by the CHMP to address questions related 
to the Adcetris Marketing Authorisation application. The questions and the SAG-O responses were as 
follows: 
1.  Regarding the submitted clinical trial data: 
a.  Is it possible to interpret the observed effects with brentuximab-vedotin in CR, ORR, PFS 
and DoR in HL and sALCL on the basis of the submitted studies in the absence of a 
controlled trial where the effect of brentuximab-vedotin is compared to historical data 
obtained with established treatment? 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 69/102 
 
 
 
The response rate in both HL and sALCL in the respective study populations (limited to patients after 
failure of ASCT in HL) is impressive. In relapsing refractory HL, this response rate suggests a high 
probability of clinical benefit, but there is no definitive proof of such benefit. It could also open the 
possibility for follow-up ASCT, but there is uncertainty as to how Adcetris might perform compared to 
other agents towards this end. In sALCL, the response rate is also high, but it is noted that only 20% 
of included patients had received ASCT prior to enrolment, this being likely so far the most potent 
therapy strategy. On the other hand, the targeted population (majority of older age and ALK negative 
patients) is expected to have more aggressive disease which increases confidence on the observed 
effects. 
b.  Can valid conclusions be drawn from the submitted comparison with results obtained by 
previous treatment in the same patients and treatment obtained with other products in 
other studies?  
No definitive conclusions can be drawn about the value of Adcetris as a therapeutic option in the 
sought indications on the basis of historical comparisons, as these always entail a high risk for 
introducing bias. Especially for the historical comparison in the sALCL indication, the historical 
comparison was limited to a single population-based study that had recruited generally older patients 
and with a worse performance status. 
Intra-patient comparisons in terms of PFS compared to prior treatment are more convincing. However, 
no definitive conclusions can be drawn due to the known limitations of this type of analysis, similar to 
historical comparisons. In addition, it is difficult to assess if the determination of the start of therapy 
and of progression was unbiased. Concerning the choice of prior treatment, ideally, comparison should 
have been made against the best previous therapy in relapsed disease (e.g. in HL against ASCT).  
c.  In light of the above does the SAG consider the observed efficacy convincing and 
clinically relevant? 
Despite limited data, the observed antitumour activity of Adcetris is considered clinically relevant, as 
the high response rate and duration of response were associated with reduction of B symptoms (fever, 
night sweats, weight loss). Moreover, the high complete response rate and duration of response in HL 
may constitute a clinical benefit in allowing a relevant percentage of patients to undergo a subsequent 
ASCT, however definitive data are lacking. In sALCL, the long duration of PFS and high response rate 
(in light of potential future ASCT) are considered clinically relevant. 
2.  Do the proposed indications constitute an unmet medical need? 
In relapsing refractory HL, there is an unmet medical need for patients who have relapsed after or are 
refractory to ASCT, but not necessarily for patients after at least two prior therapies when ASCT is not 
a treatment option. 
In ALCL, an unmet medical need is uncertain with the possible exception of patients refractory to 
previous therapy or those unfit for ASCT. 
3.  Does the SAG consider a confirmatory (randomised, controlled) study in the HL 
population as studied on SG035-003 feasible in the EU after a marketing authorisation 
for brentuximab-vedotin in the EU and what would be the design of such study? 
A randomised, controlled confirmatory study in the HL population as studied in SG035-003 would be 
difficult to conduct after approval; the feasible and preferred option would have been to conduct a 
randomised, controlled trial prior to approval.

4.  Does the SAG agree with the Applicant that patients with cutaneous TCL (e.g. pcALCL 
and mycosis fungoides eligible for treatment with bexarotene and MTX) represent an 
adequate population to study safety and efficacy of brentuximab-vedotin to support the 
currently proposed indication in the MAA for relapsed, refractory sALCL? Does the SAG 
have alternative suggestions? 
The proposed study in patients with cutaneous TCL could only provide confirmation in terms of safety, 
but it would not support the efficacy in the relapsed/refractory sALCL, as it refers to a different patient 
population. With regard to alternative confirmatory studies, a randomised study against other second 
line treatments would be desirable but it is not considered feasible; a further single-arm study looking 
at response rate, duration of response, rate of second ASCT and data in subpopulations (including but 
not necessarily restricted to ALK status and age) may serve this purpose instead.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The median overall survival (OS) in the Hodgkin lymphoma population and in the sALCL population has 
not been reached, but an OS plateau was observed in the sALCL study population and possibly as well 
in the HL study population suggesting potentially maturity of the OS results at least in the sALCL study 
population. Nevertheless, further updated OS data from studies SG035-0003 and SG035-004 should 
be provided, including sub-analysis of patients ≥ 100 kg. The data should be presented in the context 
of historical controls. 
The comparative benefit of brentuximab-vedotin has not been clearly established based on the 
uncontrolled trial and historical comparisons presented. The feasible and preferred option to obtain 
controlled data would have been to conduct a randomised, controlled confirmatory study in the HL 
population as studied in SG035-003. However, such a trial would be difficult to conduct at this time. As 
the main uncertainty relates to the patient population ineligible for ASCT, additional efficacy data for 
the relapsed/refractory HL population not eligible for ASCT should be provided by performing a single-
arm study in a similar patient population investigating response rate, PFS, OS and proportion of 
patients proceeding to transplant and safety (n=approx 60 pts).  
With regard to alternative confirmatory studies in sALCL, a randomised study against other second line 
treatments would be desirable, but this is not considered feasible due to the rarity of the disease; a 
further single-arm study looking at response rate, duration of response, rate of second ASCT and data 
in subpopulations (including but not necessarily restricted to ALK status and age) may serve this 
purpose instead.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results as provided by the Applicant, the pivotal phase 2 studies are assumed to show 
efficacy of brentuximab-vedotin in terms of ORR and PFS in relapsed or refractory post-ASCT HL and 
sALCL, despite the absence of controlled data. The difference in intra-individual comparison of 
investigator-based PFS after brentuximab-vedotin with investigator-based PFS after the most recent 
prior therapy is considered a relevant treatment effect in the majority of the post-ASCT HL and sALCL 
patient populations studied. Taken into account that brentuximab-vedotin is studied in particular as 
further line treatment, the suggested effects are considered of clinical relevance.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
Regarding the relapsed, refractory HL patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation or multi-agent 
chemotherapy, the information provided by the applicant in the detailed case reports shows anti-

tumour activity of brentuximab vedotin. However, additional efficacy/safety data in the no-ASCT/no-
multidrug patient population are essential. A further single arm study in the sALCL population to inform 
on subpopulations and rate of subsequent ASCT is also necessary. 
Finally, updated OS data from the pivotal phase II studies should be submitted when available. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The applicant submitted safety data from 6 studies with 357 patients with CD30+ haematologic 
malignancies who received at least 1 dose of SGN35 (phase 1 dose escalation studies: SG035-0001 
and SG035-0002, phase 1 studies SG035-007 and SG035-008A, pivotal phase 2 studies, SG035-0003 
and SG035-0004.)  
The median duration of treatment in study SG035-0003 was 27 weeks (range 3 to 56) and the median 
number of cycles administered per patient was 9 (range, 1 to 16). The median treatment duration with 
brentuximab-vedotin in study SG035-0004 was 20 weeks (range, 3 to 51); a median of 6 cycles 
(range, 1 to 16) have been administered per patient and slightly less than 50% of patients received 7 
or more cycles. 
A total of 261 patients received brentuximab vedotin at the proposed dsoe and schedule of 1.8mg/kg 
q3 week.  
In addition, the applicant provided information on SAEs from 5 ongoing studies (SGN35-005, SGN35-
006, SGN34-008B, SGN34-009 and SGN34-010) as well as a named patient programme (NPP). 
Analysis of the 59 detailed case reports on the relapsed, refractory HL patients not eligible for stem cell 
transplantation or multi-agent chemotherapy on exposure of these patients to brentuximab vedotin 
showed that patients received a mean of 5.3 and a median of 4 cycles of brentuximab vedotin. If these 
numbers are corrected for the patients that did not fit the proposed indication, patients received a 
mean of 5.4 and a median of 4.5 cycles brentuximab vedotin (n=56). Exposure for the patients 
receiving the proposed brentuximab vedotin dose and schedule (n = 40) and the NPP cases series only 
(n = 26) was slightly higher than for the total no-prior-ASCT population (mean 5.7 cycles, median 5 
cycles for both subsets).  
Adverse events  
An overall summary of all AEs across all clinical studies can be found in the following Table 29.

Table 29: Overall summary of adverse events 
In study SG035-0003, the AEs that occurred in ≥20% of patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(47%), fatigue (46%), nausea (42%), URTI (37%), diarrhoea (36%), pyrexia (29%), neutropenia 
(22%), vomiting (22%), and cough (21%).  
Adverse events leading to dose reduction occurred in 11% of patients; the reason for dose reduction 
was peripheral neuropathy for all but 1 patient. The highest number of dose-reductions occurred at 
cycles 10 through 16. AEs leading to dose delays occurred in 47% of patients; the most common 
reasons for delays were neutropenia (16%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (13%) and 
thrombocytopenia (4%). 
In study SG035-0004, the AEs that occurred in ≥20% of patients were nausea (38%), peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (38%) fatigue (34%), pyrexia (33%), diarrhoea (29%), and neutropenia (21%) 
and rash (21%). An AE grade ≥3 occurred in 60% of the patients.  
Adverse events resulting in dose reduction occurred in 9% of patients; 2 patients out of the 5 patients 
had dose reductions for peripheral sensory neuropathy. Adverse events that led to dose delay occurred 
in 31% of patients; these AEs were neutropenia (12%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (7%), and 
thrombocytopenia (5%). 
The most common AEs in the two pivotal phase II studies are summarised in the following Table 30.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the phase 2 studies, 31% of patients had a serious adverse event (SAE), 28% had an SAE of grade 
3 or higher, and 15% had an SAE that was determined by the investigator to be related to 
brentuximab-vedotin. The most common SAEs in the phase 2 population were abdominal pain, disease 
progression (recurrent ALCL), pulmonary embolism, and septic shock. 
All SAEs reported in the two phase II trials are summarised in the following Table 32. SAEs grade 3 or 
higher and those considered as ADRs are also summarised in the table.

Deaths 
There were 6 deaths in the phase 2 studies that occurred within 30 days of the last dose of 
brentuximab-vedotin. These deaths all occurred in systemic ALCL patients and were considered 
unrelated to treatment and were attributable to ALCL recurrent (3 patients), acute myocardial 
infarction and acute renal failure (1 patient), respiratory failure (1 patient), and sudden death 
(1 patient). During the follow-up period (more than 30 days after the last dose of brentuximab-
vedotin), 25 patients died; a Grade 5 adverse event was recorded for 1 of these patients (Hodgkin’s 
disease recurrent). Of the 31 deaths total in the phase 2 studies, 18 were considered by the 
investigator to be related to the disease under study. 
In the phase 1 dose-escalation studies, 2 patients died within 30 days of the last dose of SGN-35: 
1 patient died from febrile neutropenia and septic shock (Study SG035-0001) and 1 patient died from 
pneumonia influenza (Study SG035-0002). During the follow-up period in the phase 1 dose-escalation 
studies, there were 14 patient deaths (SG035-0001: 7 patients; SG035-0002: 7 patients). 
In the phase 1 study assessing cardiac ventricular repolarization (SGN35-007), no patients died within 
Cycle 1. In the phase 1 clinical pharmacology study (Study SGN5-008A), 1 patient with a history of 
Adcetris

allogeneic stem cell transplant died after receiving 1 dose of SGN-35 from intracranial hemorrhage, 
CMV infection, and pancytopenia, all of which were considered by the investigator to be related to 
treatment. 
Other significant events 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
To date, 2 of the patients included in the pivotal HL study suffered from progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) following brentuximab-vedotin. This severe debilitating disease resulted in 
the death of one of them. World-wide, in total 3 patients suffered from confirmed PML on a total of 
about 2,000 brentuximab-vedotin-treated patients. The incidence of PML among transplantation 
recipients has been reported to be ~1.24 per 1,000 post-transplantation person-years (Mateen et al, 
2011).  
The exact cause of death of another patient who suffered from fatal seizures could not be established 
as autopsy was not performed. Of note is that seizures are a symptom of PML as well. 
Immunological events 
Patients were tested for antitherapeutic antibody (ATA) against SGN-35 at baseline (within 2 hours 
prior to the first dose), pre-dose in each subsequent treatment cycle (Ctrough; approximately 3 weeks 
following the previous dose), and at the end-of-treatment visit. A summary of the ATA findings (ATA 
incidence and status) according to baseline ATA status from studies SG035-0003 and SG035-0004 is 
presented in the following Table 33. Study SG035-0001 was not included in the overall analysis 
because a different assay for ATA detection was used, study SG035-0002 was not included because of 
a different dosing schedule used and results from studies SGN35-007 and SGN35-008 were not 
included due to the short duration of data available from those studies. 
The majority of phase 2 patients (95%) were negative for anti-SGN35 antibodies (ATA) at baseline. 
The presence of ATA did not correlate with a substantial reduction in brentuximab-vedotin serum levels 
and did not result in a decrease in the efficacy of brentuximab-vedotin. However, patients with 
persistently positive ATA had higher incidence of infusion-related reaction compared to patients with 
transiently or never positive ATA.

Confirmed ATA-positive samples from SG035-0003 and SG035-0004 were assayed for the presence of 
neutralizing antibodies.  Of 58 patients with ATA-positive samples, 18 (31%) patients were negative 
for the presence of neutralizing antibodies, 36 (62%) had at least one sample that was positive for the 
presence of neutralizing antibodies, and 4 (7%) were of unknown status due to insufficient sample. 
In the detailed case reports of the relapsed/refractory HL patients that have previously not been 
treated with ASCT, the applicant did not report on the presence of ATA. One of the 56 patients was 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 79/102 
 
 
 
described to have suffered from a grade ≥3 drug hypersensitivity reaction, which was classified as 
unrelated to the treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
The highest incidences of new or worsening clinical laboratory values of any grade were observed for 
low leukocytes (58%), neutrophils (54%), haemoglobin (29%), lymphocytes (25%) and platelets 
(23%); and high glucose (40%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST [37%]), and alanine 
aminotranferase (ALT [34%]). 
The clinical laboratory parameters for which the highest percentages of patients in the Phase 2 
population had a postbaseline worsening of 2 or more grades were low neutrophils (30%), leukocytes 
(22%) lymphocytes (11%) and high glucose (9%). The clinical laboratory parameters for which the 
most patients (>5%) in the phase 2 population had new or worsening shifts to Grade 3 were low 
neutrophils (11%), lymphocytes (11%), platelets (6%), leukocytes (5%), high glucose (6%), and high 
ALT and AST (1%). 
In the 56 detailed case reports concerning the patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ Hodgkin 
lymphoma (HL) following at least two prior therapies when autologous stem cell transplant or multi-
agent chemotherapy is no longer a treatment option, the grade ≥3 clinical laboratory parameters were 
neutropenia (15%), lymphopenia (8%), thrombocytopenia (8%), leukopenia (2%) and hyperglycaemia 
(2%). 
Safety in special populations 
A clinical study to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on brentuximab 
vedotin and MMAE pharmacokinetics is ongoing. In the phase 2 studies, effects regarding age and race 
are inconclusive due to the small number of patients who were <18 or >65 years or older, or non-
white.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Clinical data (study SGN35-008A) from co-administration of brentuximab-vedotin with rifampicin, a 
CYP3A4 inducer, or ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, indicate that MMAE is a substrate of 
CYP3A4. Patients who are receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors concomitantly with brentuximab-vedotin 
should be closely monitored for adverse events because of the potential for modest increases in MMAE 
levels. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the phase 2 population, AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 19% of patients. The most common 
AEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (6%), peripheral motor neuropathy (2%), and disease 
recurrence (1%). 
In the relapsed or refractory HL patients that have previously not been treated with ASCT, AEs led to 
treatment discontinuation in 9% of the patients, with the most common AE being disease progression 
(i.e. 5% of the total number of patients). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Across six clinical studies that were submitted to support this application, a total of 357 patients have 
received at least one dose of brentuximab-vedotin. Based on the epidemiology of the conditions for 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 80/102 
 
 
 
which brentuximab-vedotin is intended, a limited safety base of this size is acceptable, but exposure is 
somewhat limited. 
In the pivotal studies, patients with HL and sALCL were generally similar with respect to the AE 
incidence and severity, but the percentage of patients with treatment-emergent upper respiratory tract 
infection were higher in HL patients (37%) relative to sALCL patients (12%). It is conceivable that this 
difference is due to impairment in cell-mediated immunity in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma patients 
(Franzke et al, 2006). 
Previously two other anti-CD30 therapeutic mAb without drug conjugate have been evaluated for their 
anti-neoplastic effect in CD30+haematologic malignancies. 
Forero-Torres et al (2009) evaluated SGN30 in a phase 2 study in 38 patients with refractory/recurrent 
HL. No objective responses were observed in the HL group. Anaemia grade ≥3 was reported in 4% of 
the patients. Treatment-related SAE were reported in 13% of the patients. AE leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 4% of the patients. 
Ansell et al (2007) evaluated in a phase I/II study MDX-060 in patients with relapsed HL. The 
treatment was well tolerated. Grade ≥3 treatment related AE were dyspnoea (3%), acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (1%), elevation of liver transaminases (1%), epistaxis (1%), GvHD (1%), and 
cardiac tamponade (1%). 
In the light of the low efficacy and low toxicity of the anti-CD30 mAbs SGN-30 and MDX-060, the 
efficacy, but also toxicity, of brentuximab-vedotin is most likely to be mainly due to its drug conjugate, 
the anti-tubulin agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). MMAE blocks polymerisation of tubulin and the 
maximum concentrations were typically observed 2 days post-dose and MMAE declined with an 
apparent terminal half-life of ~4 days at the 1.8 mg/kg dose level. 
The use of brentuximab vedotin is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or 
to any of the excipients of Adcetris. Combined use of bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin causes 
pulmonary toxicity and is also contraindicated. 
The phase 2 studies revealed the following key safety concerns of brentuximab-vedotin treatment in 
HL and sALCL patients:  
Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy was the most common AE occurring in 55% of the patients (39% sensory only, 
3% motor only and 12% with both) leading to treatment discontinuation (12%), and dose reductions 
(10%).  
A by-patient graphical representation of the onset, severity, duration, and resolution of all treatment-
emergent  peripheral  neuropathy  events  per  MedDRA  SMQ  was  provided  by  the  Applicant  (data  not 
shown). 
In HL patients, all grade 3 peripheral neuropathy events were preceded by lower grades of either 
sensory or motor neuropathy. In addition, grade 3 events did not typically present prior to 6 months of 
continuous brentuximab-vedotin treatment. The median time to onset of Grade 3 events is 38.0 
weeks. No Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy events were observed. 
For the sALCL patients it was shown that no event exceeded grade 3 in severity, and all PN events had 
improved to at least grade 2 or lower by the end of the observation period (± 580 days). The first 
patients of this study population showed onset of grade 3 PN at around 2 months after initiation of the 
treatment with brentuximab-vedotin, which appears to be earlier than in the HL study population. The 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 81/102 
 
 
 
dosage of brentuximab-vedotin used per cycle was equal in both studies and as such can not explain 
the possible difference in onset of the PN between the two diseases. 
Supporting data from nerve conduction study findings in patients from studies SG035-0003, SG035-
0004 and SGN35-007 (data not shown) are consistent with findings of peripheral sensory neuropathy 
and demyelinating polyneuropathy. No repeat nerve conduction studies were documented in 
association with a brentuximab-vedotin-induced event. Follow-up data at the individual patient level 
are therefore not available. 
The incidence and severity of neuropathy, as well as the nature of the events (i.e. sensory events were 
more common than motor events and a distal pattern of development was more common than a 
proximal pattern of development), is similar to that observed with other microtubule inhibitor-based 
chemotherapies (including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones). Also consistent with the clinical 
experience with microtubule inhibitors was the observation that neuropathy appeared to be a 
cumulative effect. Onset of motor neuropathy was later than non-motor events, suggesting that in 
most cases motor neuropathy occurs with higher cumulative exposure. 
In general, peripheral neuropathy was managed by early recognition, dose delay, and subsequent dose 
reduction to 1.2 mg/kg, and was reversible, with symptom improvement or resolution in more than 
60% of patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy events. Importantly, no grade 4 AE has been 
reported and peripheral sensory/motoric neuropathy appeared to resolve at least to a certain extent.  
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, 
paraesthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Patients experiencing 
new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay and a dose reduction of brentuximab 
vedotin or discontinuation of treatment, as recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Myelosuppression 
Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 13% and 7% of patients, respectively; however it was typically 
of short duration and managed by dose delays with growth factor support in some cases.  
Since the relative dose intensity in the phase 2 population was >90%, dose withholding / reduction 
had only a minimal impact on overall brenutuximab-vedotin dosing. 
Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to administration of each dose of this treatment. 
Patients should be monitored closely for fever and managed according to best medical practice if 
febrile neutropenia develops. Moreover, neutropenia should be managed by dose delays as described 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Other safety concerns 
Serious infections such as pneumonia, staphylococcal bacteraemia, and herpes zoster, and 
opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and oral candidiasis have been 
reported in patients treated with brentuximab vedotin. Patients should be carefully monitored during 
treatment for the emergence of possible serious and opportunistic infections. 
Infusion-related reactions occurred in approximately 10% of patients and were typically managed by 
dose interruptions. Infusion-related reactions are more frequent and more severe in patients with 
antibodies to brentuximab vedotin. 
Patients should be carefully monitored during and after infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, administration 
of brentuximab vedotin should be immediately and permanently discontinued and appropriate medical 
therapy should be administered. 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 82/102 
 
 
 
If an infusion-related reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical 
management instituted. The infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after symptom resolution. 
Patients who have experienced a prior infusion-related reaction should be premedicated for subsequent 
infusions. Premedication may include paracetamol, an antihistamine and a corticosteroid. 
Further safety concerns associated with brentuximab-vedotin treatment are infections and 
hyperglycaemia. It is unclear whether the one reported case of Stevens Johnson Syndrome was 
associated with brentuximab-vedotin treatment. If Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurs, treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy should be administered. 
Hyperglycaemia has been reported during clinical trials in patients with an elevated Body Mass Index 
(BMI) with or without a history of diabetes mellitus. However, any patient who experiences an event of 
hyperglycaemia should have their serum glucose closely monitored. Anti-diabetic treatment should be 
administered as appropriate. 
At this time two confirmed cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and 1 suspect 
case of PML have been reported in the 2,000 patients treated world-wide. The incidence of PML among 
transplantation recipients has been reported with ~1.24 per 1,000 post-transplantation person-years 
(Mateen et al, 2011).  
Patients should be closely monitored for new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioural signs 
or symptoms, which may be suggestive of PML. Brentuximab vedotin dosing should be held for any 
suspected case of PML. Suggested evaluation of PML includes neurology consultation, gadolinium-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JCV DNA by 
polymerase chain reaction or a brain biopsy with evidence of JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude 
PML. Additional follow up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be 
established. Brentuximab vedotin dosing should be permanently discontinued if a diagnosis of PML is 
confirmed. 
The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not 
notice (e.g., cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric symptoms). 
The safety data on heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed-refractory HL who had not been 
transplanted with autologous haematopoietic stem cells, presented by the Applicant during the Oral 
Explanantion, suggest a comparable safety profile as observed in the pivotal HL study, SG035-0003. 
However, it should be noted that this preliminary conclusion is based on only 40 patients (having 
received the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin) in total.  
From the safety information on these relapsed or refractory HL patients not previously treated with 
ASCT, 72 AEs grade I and II were observed in 56 patients that received any dose of brentuximab 
vedotin. This analysis was somewhat hampered by the fact that the grade I and II AEs were not 
specified per patient, hence AEs reported in the 3 patients (of the 59) excluded as having received only 
one therapy prior to brentuximab vedotin could not be identified. However, this exclusion should only 
lead to minor numerical adjustments. The distribution of the AEs among the described studies seemed 
comparable although patient number per study was low and there was heterogeneity regarding the 
dose and the number of cycles of brentuximab vedotin administered. In total, 59 grade ≥3 AEs were 
observed of which 7 were described to be related to brentuximab vedotin. Of 15 other grade ≥3 events 
relationship to study treatment was not reported. These AEs occurred in the patients included in the 
SGN35-007 phase 1 QTc study, the TB-BC010088 phase 1/2 Japan-only study and the NPPs. Overall, 
as no new safety concerns have been identified, it is unlikely that further specification would have 
affected the safety profile to a large extent. 
Immunogenicity of SGN-35 can not be evaluated fully as the ECL screening assay for the detection of 
ATA against brentuximab vedotin in serum of treated patients is insufficient in terms of sensitivity, 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 83/102 
Rev10.11 
 
 
 
drug tolerance and interference by sCD30 and rheumatoid factor. Under reporting of antibodies is 
possible. The screening assay for the detection of ATA against brentuximab vedotin in serum should be 
further optimised. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Due to the relatively small size of the studied population, a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) in 
the studied HL and sALCL populations (comprising at least 500 patients including at least 50 sALCL 
patients) is expected to provide comprehensive safety data to further inform the benefit/risk balance of 
Adcetris.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate contains a microtubule inhibitor. This group of 
chemotherapeutic agents are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy, most frequently 
sensory in nature, and haematological toxicities. 
In the phase 2 HL and sALCL study populations, treatment-related adverse events were common, 
leading to treatment discontinuation in 19% of patients and to dose modifications in 46% of patients. 
The most common brentuximab-vedotin treatment-related AE in the pivotal studies were peripheral 
neuropathy (55%, leading to treatment discontinuation (12%), and dose reductions (10%)), 
myelosuppression, infections and infusion reactions. The majority of AEs were managed by dose delays 
or reduction. One of the patients suffering from PML upon the use of brentuximab-vedotin died. 
The single arm study design in the pivotal studies makes it difficult to determine attribution of AEs in 
general, even more so in a heavily pre-treated patient population with disease-related immune 
dysfunctions (Franzke et al, 2006). 
The safety data on 56 heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed-refractory HL without ASCT presented 
by the applicant indicated that the safety profile is comparable with the pivotal HL study population. 
However, the heterogeneity between the patients and the not complete report on AEs should be noted. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
A Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) in both studied HL and sALCL patient populations (n=500) 
should be performed including a sufficient number of sALCL patients (i.e. at least n=50).

for use; SmPC Section 4.8, Undesirable effects 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
has been reported in patients who received this 
treatment after receiving multiple prior chemotherapy 
regimens.  PML is a rare demyelinating disease of the 
central nervous system that results from reactivation 
of latent JC virus (JCV) and is often fatal.  
Patients should be closely monitored for new or 
worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioural 
signs or symptoms that may be suggestive of PML.  
Brentuximab vedotin dosing should be held for any 
suspected case of PML.  Suggested evaluation of 
PML includes neurology consultation, gadolinium-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, 
and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JCV DNA by 
polymerase chain reaction or a brain biopsy with 
evidence of JCV.  A negative JC-V PCR does not 
exclude PML.  Additional follow up and evaluation 
may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be 
established.  Brentuximab vedotin dosing should be 
permanently discontinued if a diagnosis of PML is 
confirmed. 
The physician should be particularly alert to 
symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not 
notice (eg, cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric 
symptoms). 
SmPC Section 4.3, Contraindications 
The use of bleomycin and brentuximab vedotin in 
combination is contraindicated due to associated 
pulmonary toxicity reported in a phase 1 study.  The 
brentuximab vedotin + ABVD combination cohort of 
the trial has been terminated and no further dosing 
with this combination is planned.   
SmPC Section 4.2, Posology and method of 
administration; SmPC Section 4.4, Special warnings 
and precautions for use; SmPC Section 4.8, 
Undesirable effects 
Brentuximab vedotin treatment may cause a 
peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory.  
Cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been 
reported.  Brentuximab vedotin-induced peripheral 
neuropathy is typically an effect of cumulative 
exposure to this medicinal product and is reversible in 
most cases.  In clinical studies, the majority of 
patients had improvement or resolution of their 
symptoms.  Neuropathy appeared to be mitigated by 
dose delay and subsequent reduction or brentuximab 
vedotin discontinuation. 
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of 
neuropathy, such as hypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, 
paraesthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, 
neuropathic pain or weakness.  Patients experiencing

of brentuximab vedotin should be immediately and 
permanently discontinued and appropriate medical 
therapy should be administered. 
If an IRR occurs, the infusion should be interrupted 
and appropriate medical management instituted.  The 
infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after 
symptom resolution.  Patients who have experienced a 
prior IRR should be premedicated for subsequent 
infusions.  Premedication may include paracetamol,

Patients with relapsed or refractory HL and sALCL in 
two phase 2 studies were tested for antibodies to 
brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks using a sensitive 
electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay.  
Approximately 35% of subjects in these studies 
developed antibodies to brentuximab vedotin.  Of 
these patients, the majority became positive prior to 
Dose 2, 7% were persistently ATA-positive, and 62% 
of the ATA-positive patients had neutralizing 
antibodies.  One percent (1%) of patients experienced 
adverse reactions consistent with IRRs that led to 
discontinuation of treatment. 
The presence of antibodies to brentuximab vedotin 
did not correlate with a clinically meaningful 
reduction in serum brentuximab vedotin levels and 
did not result in a decrease in the efficacy of 
brentuximab vedotin  While the presence of 
antibodies to brentuximab vedotin does not 
necessarily predict the development of an IRR, there 
was a higher incidence of IRRs in patients with 
persistently positive ATA (30%) relative to patients 
with transiently positive ATA (12%), and 
never-positive ATA (7%).

There are no data from the use of brentuximab 
vedotin in pregnant women and there have been no 
studies on the effects of brentuximab vedotin on 
human female fertility.  Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity.  Brentuximab vedotin 
caused embryo-fetal lethality in pregnant female rats.   
There are no data as to whether brentuximab vedotin 
or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  A risk 
to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  If a 
breastfeeding woman needs to be treated, a decision 
should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from brentuximab vedotin 
therapy, taking into account a potential risk of 
breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman. 
Women of childbearing potential must use two 
methods of effective contraception during treatment 
with brentuximab vedotin and until 30 days following 
the last dose. 
The effects of brentuximab vedotin on human male 
fertility have not been studied.  However, results of 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats indicate the 
potential for brentuximab vedotin to impair male 
reproductive function and fertility.  In nonclinical 
studies, brentuximab vedotin has resulted in testicular 
toxicity, and may alter male fertility.  Testicular 
atrophy and degeneration were partially reversible 
following a 16-week treatment-free period.  MMAE 
has been shown to have aneugenic properties.  
Therefore, men being treated with brentuximab 
vedotin are advised advised to have sperm samples 
frozen and stored prior to treatment and not to father a 
child during and up to 6 months following the last 
dose.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) post-ASCT: The primary efficacy endpoint in the study 
on HL (SG035-0003) was overall response rate (ORR). ORR is a measure of anti-tumour activity and it 
may be considered as an acceptable endpoint to demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with relapsed 
or refractory HL post-ASCT for conditional approval, provided that the effect is sufficiently large.  
Currently, the applicant provided updated efficacy results for Study SG035-0003 (HL) with 
1 August 2011 (2 April 2012 for OS) as data cut off date, which showed that: 
- the ORR was 75% (76/102) with a CR rate of 33% (34/102) by IRF analysis 
- the estimated median duration of response per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 6.7 months [95% 
CI (3.6, 14.8)] (range 1.2 to 26.1 months) 
- the median duration of response in patients with CR has not been reached [95% CI (10.8, -)]; the 
current duration of response ranges from 1.4 to 26.1 months 
- the estimated median PFS per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 5.6 months [95% CI (5.0, 9.0 
months)] (range, 1.2 to 27.3 months) 
- at the time of the last analysis (2 April 2012), 40 of 102 patients were known to have died. The 
median overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier analysis has not been reached [95% CI (27, – months)]. 
These data indicate a benefit that is at least comparable to historical controls and perhaps better. The 
chance to obtain CR and another option for potentially curative stem cell transplantation is meaningful. 
Relapsed/Refractory HL in patients ineligible for ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy: The applicant 
provided safety and efficacy data for 56 patients with relapsed or refractory HL who had received at 
least 2 chemotherapy cycles and no ASCT, 40 of whom received the proposed schedule. Overall 
response rate, complete response rate and the percentage of patients that become eligible for 
transplantation are considered currently the most important read-outs for the anti-tumour activity of 
brentuximab-vedotin in this patient population ineligible for ASCT or multidrug chemotherapy: 
- ORR seemed lower as compared to the results as observed in the study SG035-0003, regardless of 
dose and schedule (46% ORR for the 56 no-prior-ASCT patients, 57% ORR for the 40 proposed-dose-
and-schedule no-prior-ASCT patients versus 75% ORR for study SG035-0003 patients). 
- The CR rates were also lower, i.e. 21% CR for all no-prior-ASCT patients, 23% CR for proposed-dose-
and-schedule no-prior-ASCT patients versus 33% CR for study SG035-0003 patients. In the Named 
Patient Programme (NPP) population only, that is considered to reflect day-to-day clinical practice, 
these response rates were similar. 
- With regard to patients becoming eligible for stem cell transplantation, 20% of the 40 proposed-
dose-and-schedule patients (27% when considering only the 26 NPPs patients) have become eligible 
for stem cell transplantation upon treatment with brentuximab vedotin 
The applicant provided very limited PFS/OS data in the case reports, insufficient for any conclusion. 
Overall, these data indicate that brentuximab vedotin shows anti-tumour activity in the relapsed or 
refractory HL patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation or muli-agent chemotherapy.

Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (sALCL): To support the indication relapsed or refractory 
sALCL a pivotal phase 2 trial (SG035-0004) in 58 patients was submitted. In this study the same 
endpoints and the assessment of the endpoints were used as in the study in patients with Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma. 
The most updated efficacy results with 13 July 2011 (2 April 2012 for OS) as data cut off date showed 
that: 
- the ORR was 86% (50/58) with a CR rate of 59% (34/58) 
- the estimated median duration of response per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 13.2 months [95% 
CI (5.7,-)] (range, 0.1 to 21.7 months). Of the 50 patients who had an objective response, 27 had had 
disease progression or had died. 
- among patients who achieved a best response of CR, the estimated median duration of response per 
IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was not reached [95% CI (13.0 months, -)] (range, 0.7 to 21.7 months). 
Of the 34 patients who had a CR, 13 had had disease progression or had died. 
- the estimated median PFS per IRF by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 14.3 months [95% CI (6.9,-)] 
(range, 0.8 to 23.6 months). 
- at the time of the last analysis (2 April 2012), 21 of 58 patients were known to have died. The 
median overall survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis was not reached [95% CI (21.3 , - )]. The estimated 
overall survival rate at 12 months was 71% [95% CI (57, 80)]. 
In both pivotal studies, the intra-individual analysis of the PFS in the study populations suggests that 
brentuximab-vedotin provides a main clinical benefit compared to prior treatment regimens.  When 
optimal treatment is given to patients, any next line therapy usually results in lower efficacy, both in 
relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the absence of a controlled trial where the effect of brentuximab-vedotin is compared to established 
regimens in the proposed indications (regimens consisting of e.g. gemcitabine, vinorelbine or a 
combination thereof), it is difficult to interpret the claimed effects in terms of PFS and OS.  
The median overall survival (OS) in the Hodgkin’s lymphoma population and in the sALCL population 
has not been reached. However, an OS plateau is observed in the sALCL study population and possibly 
as well in the HL study population (cut of date 2 April 2012). This suggests maturity of the OS results 
at least in the sALCL study population, although definitive conclusions can not be drawn at this time.  
The patient population with relapsed or refractory HL after at least two prior therapies not eligible for 
ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy was not included in the pivotal studies. Very limited efficacy and 
safety date were provided from 56 patients meeting these criteria enrolled in the phase I studies and 
the named patient programmes. Little PFS/OS data were provided for these patients. This may be 
explained by the fact that the data were obtained from 6 different studies in combination with the 
immaturity of the data and the fact that 20% of the patients proceeded to stem cell transplantation. 
Importantly, the applicant provided a biological rationale to extrapolate the results from the pivotal 
SG035-003 (HL) and SG035-004 (sALCL) studies to HL patients ineligible for ASCT/multidrug 
chemotherapy, in that CD30 expression is consistent throughout the HL and sALCL populations and it is 
not subject to change upon therapy (including ASCT), which is supported. Nevertheless, efficacy data 
in this patient population are relatively limited.

The optimal duration of the treatment with brentuximab-vedotin has not been studied as such. The 
pivotal studies aimed at administrating 16 cycles of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab–vedotin with an interval of 
3 weeks. In both the HL and the sALCL patient population, 83% of the patients did not receive the 
target number of cycles. The median number of cycles administered to the patients treated was 7 and 
the number of cycles to achieve complete response ranged between 2 and 4. At this time it is unknown 
how many cycles are required to obtain a durable response or whether patients can be cured by the 
administration of brentuximab-vedotin as a single agent. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of brentuximab-vedotin was consistent across studies. In the phase 2 population of 
160 patients practically all patients experienced AEs: 92% were treatment related, 57% were ≥ grade 
3. The most frequent grade ≥3 treatment emergent AEs were related to myelosuppression, peripheral 
sensory neuropathy and hyperglycaemia.  
Serious AEs were experienced by 49 patients, or 31%. Forty-four patients or 28% had grade ≥3 SAEs. 
15% of patients had treatment related SAEs as determined by the investigator and 28% had a SAE 
grade 3 or higher. The most common SAE preferred terms (3 patients or 2% each) were abdominal 
pain, disease progression (recurrent sALCL), pulmonary embolism, and septic shock. Important 
treatment-related SAEs were demyelinating polyneuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, pneumonia, 
pyrexia and urinary tract infection. 
Thirty-one patients or 19% died. Seven deaths (4% of the phase 2 population) could not be attributed 
to the disease. Six deaths or 4% occurred within 30 days after start of treatment. None of these were 
attributed to the drug.  
AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 19% of patients and to dose modifications (delays, reductions, 
or adjustments) in 46% of patients. The most important of these AEs were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy and disease progression.  
The most common treatment emergent AE was peripheral sensory neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy 
was assessed by the investigator, using the peripheral neuropathy (PN) standardised MedDRA Query. 
Any PN treatment-emergent AE was reported in 84 patients (53% of the phase 2 population); these 
were grade 3 or higher in 18 patients, or 11% of the phase 2 population. Higher grade events occurred 
later in the course of therapy than did lower grade events, presumably reflecting the influence of 
increasing cumulative doses. Resolution of treatment emergent peripheral neuropathy before end of 
treatment occurred in 16 patients, or 19% of patients with peripheral neuropathy. At last follow-up 
after end of treatment this number had increased to 26 patients. Median duration of follow-up after 
end of treatment was ten weeks. In 30 out of 84 patients, peripheral neuropathy had resolved fully on 
the last follow-up visit and 22 had improved. 32 patients of these 84 patients experiencing peripheral 
neuropathy did not improve. Irreversible sensory neuropathy may be a disabling condition and it was 
cited as a major reason for discontinuing due to AEs, indicating the impact of this AE. Occurrence of 
this side effect might lead to dose reductions. Treatment emergent motor neuropathy was reported in 
20 of 160 patients in the phase 2 trials (12.5%). Seven of these had grade 3. AEs potentially 
associated with autonomic neuropathy were reviewed in the phase 2 population. The most common 
AEs in the phase 2 populations that were potentially associated with autonomic neuropathy were 
constipation, abdominal pain, dizziness.

Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 13% and 7% of patients, respectively. Most cases were 
manageable with dose delays and sometimes with treatment with growth factors.  
Infusion related reactions occurred in 11% of patients and were managed by dose interruptions. 
Infections were observed in 58% of patients in the phase 2 studies. The majority of infections was 
grade 1 or 2, and occurred with an incidence comparable to that reported in similar populations. The 
most frequent infection was grade 1 or 2 upper respiratory tract infection (URTI); the incidence of 
pneumonia was lower than that reported in the literature for comparable populations. Grade 3 or 4 
infections occurred in < 10% of patients, and no Grade 5 infections were reported during phase 2 
studies.  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) constitutes a very serious adverse event that may 
be related to the use of brentuximab-vedotin. To date, two confirmed cases and one suspect case have 
been documented of which one patient with Hodgkin lymphoma has died.  
No new safety concerns were identified from the data as supplied by the applicant in the detailed case 
reports of relapsed or refractory HL patients not eligible for ASCT or multidrug therapy. Overall, the 
safety profile seemed comparable between the pivotal study population and the relapsed/refractory HL 
population ineligible for ASCT or multidrug chemotherapy despite some shortcomings in the reporting 
of the data discussed in the clinical safety section.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Across six clinical studies that were submitted to support this application, a total of 357 patients have 
received at least one dose of brentuximab-vedotin. Based on the epidemiology of the conditions for 
which brentuximab-vedotin is intended, a limited safety base of this size is acceptable, but exposure is 
somewhat limited. Moreover, the attributability of AEs to study drugs is severely limited by the single 
arm study design. Whether or not AEs were to be attributed to the drug was determined by the 
investigator in the trials and by the applicant in the integrated presentation of ADRs in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. Scoring AEs can be biased in single arm studies, even despite the use of standardised 
scoring systems like the one used in the assessment of peripheral neuropathy. The number of patients 
who received brentuximab-vedotin at the proposed dose and schedule was limited, i.e. 17% in both 
the HL and sALCL study populations. 
The precise mechanism of testicular toxicity in rats is not known and there is uncertainty on the 
presence of CD30 in human spermatogonia/early spermatocytes. It remains therefore uncertain 
whether the testicular toxicity would occur in humans as well. This has not been studied. Men treated 
with brentuximab-vedotin should not father a child during treatment and until 6 months after 
treatment. 
The incidence of neutropenia grade 3 or higher was increased in presence of rifampicin which may be 
explained by increased formation of active metabolites. This uncertainty will be addressed by a phase 1 
study to quantify MMAE and metabolites in human plasma and urine with and without rifampicin, which 
is included in the RMP. 
Pharmacokinetics of MMAE was greatly influenced by serum albumin levels. MMAE concentrations 
increased substantially at low albumin levels, possibly due to reduced MMAE clearance. 
Pharmacokinetic data from patients with renal and hepatic impairment in the SGN-35-008b study will 
address this uncertainty which is included in the RMP.

As already indicated, the incidence of PML in patients treated (3/2000) with brentuximab-vedotin to 
date is considered ‘uncommon’ (MeDRA). However, there is a rather large uncertainty as regards the 
true incidence of PML. PML has been included as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Immunogenicity of SGN-35 could not be evaluated fully as the ECL screening assay for the detection of 
ATA against brentuximab vedotin in serum of treated patients is insufficient in terms of sensitivity, 
drug tolerance and interference by sCD30 and rheumatoid factor. Under reporting of antibodies is 
possible. The screening assay for the detection of ATA against brentuximab vedotin in serum should be 
further optimised. Formation of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) is included in the RMP and 
development of the ECL ATA assay is an additional pharmacovigilane activity addressing this concern. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The patient population with relapsed or refractory HL after at least two prior therapies and not treated 
with ASCT has been studied in 18 patients in two early Phase I studies, in 7 patients from a Phase I 
QTc study, in 5 Japanese patients and in 26 patients from the Named Patient Programmes, in total 
56 patients. The information in the provided detailed case reports was obtained from a very 
heterogeneous set of patients and is in several aspects immature and limited, but still contained useful 
data. Within this context, the CHMP concluded that brentuximab vedotin showed anti-tumour activity 
in the relapsed, refractory HL patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation or multi-agent 
chemotherapy. Moreover, the safety profile was shown to be acceptable and comparable with that 
observed in the pivotal HL study population. Despite the limitations of the provided data, the 
preliminary conclusion that brentuximab vedotin offers an around 1 in 5 chance for stem cell 
transplantation and as such an opportunity for prolonged PFS and potentially cure of the disease, 
should be considered to be a main finding. In addition, an ORR of 55% and a CR of 23% for the 
proposed dose and schedule for patients in this population not becoming eligible for ASCT upon 
brentuximab vedotin can be considered clinically relevant in itself. 
In relapsed or refractory HL patients already treated with ASCT treatment with brentuximab-vedotin 
led to 75% ORR with 33% CR. In patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL treatment with 
brentuximab-vedotin led to 86% ORR with 59% CR. The studied patients included both patients who 
had undergone ASCT (12/58) and those who had not. Obtaining CR is an important advantageous 
‘interim’ outcome for further curative treatment options, i.e. stem cell transplantation. Possibly PR has 
the same role although there is a higher degree of uncertainty. Also, clinical benefit in terms of 
resolution of B-symptoms was obtained. 
Based on the updated PFS data, the median PFS observed was 5.6 months in HL patients, and 14.3 
months in sALCL patients. The results in HL patients after ASCT were at least as good as observed with 
conventional chemotherapy and sometimes even better (see Devizzi et al, 1994; Little et al, 1998; 
Crump, 2008; Blum et al, 2010). However, historical comparisons always entail a high risk for 
introducing bias and a randomised, controlled study would have been preferred at this stage. In 
patients with sALCL the PFS of 13.2 months is impressive and comparison with historical controls is 
hampered by the lack of available data. More information was obtained from the intra-individual 
analysis of the PFS results as obtained with brentuximab-vedotin after the previous line of treatment 
although here, ideally, comparison should have been made with best previous treatment. The data 
available did suggest a clinical benefit for the majority of the patients, i.e. 59% and 60% for the HL 
and sALCL population, respectively.  
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 96/102 
 
 
 
The median overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier analysis has not been reached in both patient 
groups. In the HL population, 62/108 patients were alive at the time of the last analysis and in the 
sALCL population, the estimated overall survival rate at 12 months was 71% (37/58 patients alive at 
12 months). Within the context of the high mortality risk, these results can be considered as 
potentially favourable, but inconclusive and further follow-up is needed. 
Frequently reported AEs were neurotoxicity, myelosuppression and infections. The high rates of grade 
3 AEs and SAEs indicate that brentuximab-vedotin should be considered toxic. AEs were a reason for 
discontinuation in almost a fifth of the phase 2 population. Mortality was high at 19%, but mostly 
disease related. Myelosuppression, in particular neutropenia, was reversible and comparable with that 
seen with chemotherapy. The most common treatment emergent AE was peripheral sensory 
neuropathy that may be irreversible in 20% of the patients. Treatment emergent motor neuropathy 
was also reported in 12.5% of the patients. The risk of developing PML post-treatment is considered 
balanced by the natural course of HL and sALCL when found refractory or relapsed after multiple 
treatment regimens.  
In view of the grave prognosis of the diseases presently proposed to be indicated for brentuximab-
vedotin, the observed adverse events, with the incidence observed at this time, are considered an 
acceptable risk, but follow-up data are needed to assess this further, in particular the risk for 
neurotoxicity and PML. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The anti-tumour activity of brentuximab-vedotin has been established in the HL and sALCL study 
populations as well as in the relapsed or refractory HL patients ineligible for ASCT/multidrug 
chemotherapy. The different clinical endpoints demonstrated clinical benefit in terms of disease 
control, resolution of B-symptoms and in terms of enabling further potentially curative treatment 
options. Moreover, the safety profile as reported is considered to entail acceptable risks. However, the 
lack of a control arm in the pivotal studies results in the need for confirmation of the benefit/risk profile 
of brentuximab-vedotin.  
Overall, the provided evidence in its entirety was considered convincing and the benefits in the 
relapsed/refractory HL and sALCL patients and in the population with relapsed/refractory HL after at 
least two prior therapies and not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation or multi-drug therapy 
can be considered established and considered to outweigh the risks associated with its use.  
The inclusion criteria of both pivotal trials specified that only patients with proven CD30-positive 
malignancies were allowed. While sALCL is always CD30-positive, a subset of Hodgkin’s lymphomas is 
CD30 negative. It is therefore appropriate that the indication in the treatment of patients with relapsed 
or refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) only includes patients with CD30-positive HL. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Relapsed sALCL patients that have chemosensitive disease may become eligible for stem cell 
transplantation with contemporary chemotherapy which may be an alternative treatment option. This 
is different for the refractory sALCL patients, where the use of brentuximab-vedotin, due to its novel 
working mechanism, may render these patients eligible for stem cell transplantation and as such may 
offer a chance for cure or prolonged survival of the disease. This raises the question whether the sALCL 
patients should be restricted to refractory sALCL patients only, but it may not always be possible to 
make a distinction between relapsed and refractory patients, both before and after stem cell 
transplantation. Therefore, it is proposed not to make this distinction.

Lack of controlled data warrants further clinical studies to provide comprehensive data on the benefit-
risk balance. The Applicant has proposed the following programme of clinical studies to meet this 
requirement. 
• 
The ongoing AETHERA study, which examines in a randomized and blinded setting the single-agent 
potential for brentuximab-vedotin to treat patients at high risk for residual HL following transplant. 
This study compares the same brentuximab-vedotin dose and regimen as explored in SG035-0003 
against placebo and will build a comparative safety database (n=322). Definitive report will be 
filled in June 2014.   
•  A Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) in both studied HL and sALCL patient populations 
(n=500). Duration will be 3 years. Applicant should commit to include a sufficient number of sALCL 
patients (i.e. at least n=50). 
• 
Further OS follow up of the patients included in study SG035-0003 and in study SG035-004: For 
SG035-003, a report will be filled annually to report on OS until 2015 or until enough survival 
events accrue that no need for follow-up remains, whichever occurs earlier. Likewise for 
SG035 004, a report will be filled annually to report on OS until 2016 or until enough survival 
events accrue that no need for follow-up remains, whichever occurs earlier. 
•  A randomised, controlled trial will examine patients with newly diagnosed mature T-cell lymphoma 
(MTCL), including 75% (± 5%) of patients with sALCL. (n=±300). This trial will provide safety data 
in the sALCL population. Study will complete and report in the 2018-2019 timeframe. 
However, the CHMP considered that the AETHERA study and the study in MTCL target different patient 
population than the currently intended ones. 
The CHMP considered that Adcetris falls under the scope of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 507/2006 as eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as it belongs to: 
a) Medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products in accordance with Article 3 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000; 
b) Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of 
seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases. 
Furthermore, the requirements listed in Article 4 of the Regulation apply to brentuximab vedotin on the 
basis of the following reasons: 
a) The risk-benefit balance of the product is positive:  
In the patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma following autologous stem cell 
transplant or patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma brentuximab 
vedotin showed efficacy in terms of a significant increase in ORR and PFS, despite the absence of 
confirmatory controlled data. The intra-individual comparisons of investigator-based PFS after 
brentuximab vedotin with investigator-based PFS after the most recent prior therapy are considered a 
relevant treatment effect in the majority of the post-ASCT HL and sALCL patient populations studied. 
Regarding the relapsed-refractory HL patients for whom autologous stem cell transplantation or multi-
drug chemotherapy is not an option, anti-tumour activity is considered to be established on the basis 
of the response rates. Importantly, for all these indications the chance to obtain CR and an(other) 
option for a potentially curative stem cell transplantation is of major importance. Taking into account 
that brentuximab vedotin is proposed in particular as a late line treatment, the suggested effects are 
considered of clinical relevance. Together with an acceptable safety-profile in patients in any of the 
three proposed indications and considering the overall grave prognosis of the patients involved, the 
benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Adcetris 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11

b) It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive clinical data: 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of 
brentuximab vedotin in the proposed indications. More specifically: 
- Updated Overall Survival data from the pivotal studies SG035-0003, SG035-004 will be provided, 
including a sub-analysis in patients ≥ 100 kg. The data should be presented annually in the context of 
historical controls until 2015 and 2016, respectively, or until enough OS events have occurred, 
whichever occurs earlier 
- a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) in both studied relapsed/refractory HL and sALCL patient 
populations (n=500) including a sufficient number of sALCL patients (i.e. at least n=50) will provide 
comprehensive safety data to inform the benefit/risk 
- in HL patients with relapsed/refractory disease ineligible for ASCT a single-arm study investigating 
response rate, duration of response, rate of (second) ASCT and data in subpopulations (including but 
not necessarily restricted to ALK status and age) will be provided by Q2 2016 as as a randomised 
clinical trial is not feasible in this patient population 
- for the relapsed/refractory sALCL population, an additional single-arm study looking at response rate, 
duration of response, rate of second ASCT and data in subpopulations (including, but not necessarily 
restricted, to ALK status and age) will be provided by Q1 2016, as a randomised clinical trial is not 
feasible in this patient population 
c) Fulfilment of unmet medical need in the proposed indications: 
Currently there are no approved treatment options for the patients that fit the proposed indications. 
Brentuximab vedotin provides a chance to reach CR and an(other) option for a potentially curative 
stem cell transplantation, which is considered of clinical relevance. Therefore, unmet medical needs will 
be fulfilled. 
d) The benefits to patients of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: 
In the favourable benefit-risk profile, the chance to obtain CR and an(other) option for potentially 
curative stem cell transplantation is a main finding for the proposed HL and sALCL patient populations 
that are currently without a good treatment option besides palliative care. In combination with an 
overall grave prognosis of these patients, the immediate availability of Adcetris on the market 
outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Adcetris in the treatment of treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or 
following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherpay are not a treatment 
option and in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (sALCL) is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing

PART VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary  of  risk  management  plan 
(sebelipase alfa) 
for  Kanuma 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kanuma. The RMP details important risks 
of  Kanuma, how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Kanuma’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Kanuma’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kanuma should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Kanuma should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Kanuma’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Kanuma  is  authorised  for  treatment  of  patients  of  all  ages  with  lysosomal  acid  lipase  deficiency, 
which is a genetic disease that leads to liver damage, high blood cholesterol, and other complication 
due to a build-up of certain types of fats (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides). It contains sebelipase 
alfa as the active substance and it is given by infusion. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Kanuma’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Kanuma’s  EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Kanuma, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Kanuma’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
−  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
− 
−  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
−  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied to  the  patient  (e.g.  with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Kanuma, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kanuma is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Kanuma  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kanuma. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term 
use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Identified risk: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
This risk is based on the experience from clinical trials 
and  post-marketing  experience  as  well  as  known 
potential  of  all  medicinal  products  and  on  the  class 
effect  of  all  therapeutic  proteins,  including  Kanuma 
(sebelipase alfa). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The experience with ERT in lysosomal storage disorder 
noted  that  patients  with  ADAs  were  more  likely  to

(Kishnani, 2016). However, the pooled data analysis for 
KANUMA from 6 completed clinical trials did not confirm

Potential risk: ADA development impacting response to drug 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
This potential risk is based on the known potential of 
all  medicinal  products  and  on  the  class  effect  of  all 
therapeutic  proteins,  including  Kanuma  (sebelipase 
alfa). 
The absence or presence of the mutant enzyme protein 
(i.e.  cross-reactive  immunologic  material  negative  or 
positive,  respectively)  in  patients  with  lysosomal 
storage disease primarily determines the immunologic 
response  to  enzyme  replacement  therapy.  No  data 
were  identified  for  the  distribution  of  cross-reactive 
immunologic  material  or  other  risk  factors  for  ADA 
development  in  patients  with  lysosomal  acid  lipase 
deficiency. 
In  Study  LAL-CL08,  patients  who  completely  lack  the 
ability  to  produce  both  enzymes  showed  the  highest 
levels of ADAs and neutralising antibodies, most likely 
related to the lack of enzyme and immune intolerance. 
Two patients who completely lack the ability to produce 
both enzymes  underwent successful bone marrow and 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, resulting in a 
decrease in ADAs and neutralising antibodies attributed 
to the presence of enzyme, which in turn lowered the 
need for higher doses of sebelipase alfa.

Potential risk: Use in patients with egg allergy 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Sebelipase  alfa  (active  ingredient  of  Kanuma)  is 
produced in egg white of transgenic hens. Subjects with 
known  egg  allergies  have  been  excluded  from  clinical 
trials and as such, the data on use of Kanuma in this 
patient  population  and  the  potential  outcomes  is 
limited. 
Studies  suggest  that  egg  allergy  is  more  common  in 
children  than  in  adults  and  that  many  children  will 
develop  a  tolerance  for  eggs  as  they  age  towards 
adulthood (Savage, 2007).

II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorisation: 
The LAL Deficiency Registry 
Purpose of the study:  
The objective of  the LAL Deficiency  Registry is to use  uniform methodology to collect longitudinal 
data over an extended period to provide information that can be used to: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Further understand the disease, its progression and any associated complications. 
Evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of sebelipase alfa. 
Evaluate  the  long-term  effectiveness  of  other  potential  therapeutic  and  supportive 
interventions. 
Evaluate  information  on  sebelipase  exposure  in  patient  populations  for  which  limited 
information is available, including paediatric patients 2 to 4 years in age, adults > 65 years 
in age, and patients who are pregnant or lactating 
 
 
• 
• 
Improve care through evidence-based patient management. 
Understand the relationship between lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, access to care (e.g. 
access  to  relevant  clinical specialists  with  specific  disease  monitoring  and/or management 
strategies), and clinical outcomes. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
There are no studies required for Kanuma.

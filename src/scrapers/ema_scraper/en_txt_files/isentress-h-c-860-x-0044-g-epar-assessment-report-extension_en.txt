The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
The current guidance on the clinical development of medicines for the treatment of HIV infection 
(EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02 Revision 2) states that: 
“Provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data support robust dose recommendations, an extrapolation 
of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted. However, at least non-comparative 
data in children on the safety and efficacy of the proposed dose regimens over appropriate time-spans 
should be provided. Due to high viral loads in the youngest children, viral response data in these 
patients are of particular interest.  
The provision of adequate data in children is especially important should large inter-individual 
pharmacokinetic variability be observed in the paediatric population. Also, additional drug-drug 
interaction studies may be considered necessary, at least as post-marketing commitments, and 
population pharmacokinetic studies should be considered.” 
The Applicant has broadly complied with this advice.  
In addition, the content of this programme falls within the agreed PIP. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP for the present application. 
Licensing status

2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction 
ISENTRESS (raltegravir) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded 
enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents integration of the HIV 
genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the production of 
new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. 
ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in in adults, adolescents, and children from the age 
of 2 years. 
The Applicant initially developed 400 mg poloxamer tablets for use in adults. In the line extension 
application X/24G (Commission Decision issued on 25/02/2013), the Applicant sought approval for 25 
mg and 100 mg chewable tablets (CT) for use from the age of 2 years with an option to use either the 
adult tablet or CT from the age of 6 years and body weight 25 kg. The Applicant seek approval for

granules for oral suspension for use in younger subjects aged from 4 weeks to < 2 years and with 
body weight from 3-<20 kg. The data to support this application come from the Phase 1 PK study P068 
(which also supported use of the CT) and from the final Cohorts enrolled into study P022 (which also 
supported use of the adult and CT in older children according to age and weight). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules for oral suspension containing 100 mg/sachet of 
raltegravir (as potassium salt) as active substance resulting in a suspension of 20 mg/ml after 
reconstitution with water. 
Other ingredients are: hydroxypropyl cellulose, sucralose, mannitol, monoammonium glycyrrhizinate,  
sorbitol (E420), fructose, banana flavour, sucrose, crospovidone type A, magnesium stearate, 
hypromellose 2910/6cP, macrogol/PEG 400, ethylcellulose 20 cP, ammonium hydroxide, medium chain 
triglycerides, oleic acid, microcrystalline cellulose and carmellose sodium. 
The product is available in PET/Alu /LLDPE sachets. One carton contains 60 sachets, two reusable 5 ml 
oral dosing syringes for administration and 2 reusable mixing cups for reconstitution.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance is the same as that used in the currently approved 400 mg tablets and 25 and 
100 mg chewable tablets, EU/1/07/436/001-004. For information on the active substance reference is 
made to Module 3.2.S of the marketing authorisation of the 400 mg tablets and 25 and 100 mg 
chewable tablets. Suitability of the active substance specification for the pharmaceutical form granules 
for suspension (e.g. particle size) was demonstrated. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Development of raltegravir pediatric formulations focused on identifying an effective, palatable dosage 
form, suitable for use in children down to 4 weeks.  
Several key components were considered during formulation and process development including dose 
uniformity, palatability, and development of a dosage form with acceptable physical, mechanical and 
chemical attributes. 
In view of the above Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), the applicant identified the following critical 
quality attributes (CQA): identity, assay, appearance, impurities, content uniformity, microbial limits, 
elegance, moisture, processability, sachet integrity and functionality, taste, weight uniformity, yield. 
Initial development sought to develop a tablet for dispersion to form an oral suspension. The tablet for 
dispersion concept was abandoned after it was determined that excipients providing a uniform 
suspension did not give tablets with adequate mechanical strength or acceptable suspension 
properties. To achieve an unpreserved, suspension formulation, a granule for suspension formulation 
was developed with appropriate palatability and taste masking. A coated granule intermediate was 
used. The same coated granule intermediate has already been authorised in the chewable tablets. This 
coated intermediate, once dispersed in water begins to dissolve its coating therefore, flavour and 
sweeteners are included as part of the taste masking system. Consequently the coated granule

Page 8/57 
 
 
 
 
 
intermediate is then blended with flavour, sweeteners, mannitol, crospovidone, magnesium stearate 
and a suspending agent, co-processed microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium. 
This combination provides taste modulation to increase patient compliance and suspension uniformity 
to allow dose adjustment with an oral syringe. All the excipients of the formulation, apart from the 
microcrystalline cellulose/carboxymethylcellulose sodium mixture, are already authorised for the 
chewable tablets.  
The flavour system for raltegravir granules for oral suspension was developed to be simplified relative 
to the chewable tablet due to the younger patient population. Banana flavour was selected with two 
sweeteners sucralose and magnasweet (a delayed onset sweetener containing fructose, sorbitol and 
monoammonium glycyrrhizinate). During the clinical studies (PN 068 and PN1066), taste was 
evaluated using a questionnaire and caregiver assessments of patient dosing and compliance. These 
assessments supported that taste was overall acceptable (see clinical part). During taste assessment, 
it was found that taste of the constituted product deteriorated with time after dilution, with a 30 
minute dosing window maximum supported by questionnaire results. 
Raltegravir granules for oral suspension was formulated as a variant of the raltegravir chewable tablets 
formulation. As a result, their manufacturing processes are similar sharing a common standard fluid 
bed granulation, a common bottom-spray coating process and similar extra-granular excipients in the 
final blend. During the development of the common granulation the suitability for the raltegravir 
granules for oral suspension process was also assessed. Downstream development from the coated 
granule intermediate was specific for the granules for oral suspension. 
To establish a comprehensive development plan, a risk assessment for raltegravir granules for 
suspension process was conducted using a Failure, Mode and Effects Analysis method (FMEA). This 
assessment was conducted prior to the start of development, to identify key risks or knowledge gaps 
associated with the process. Development studies were subsequently performed on the unit operations 
that were shown to have knowledge gaps or significant potential risk. The results of the risk analysis 
were then used to support the development of the proposed control strategy that ensures the drug 
product can consistently be produced to meet the predetermined critical quality attributes. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. 
The primary packaging is PET/Alu/LLDPE sachets. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. A CE mark declaration of conformity is provided for the 
syringe.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The same coated active substance granules as already approved for the chewable tablets are used as 
an intermediate: this is performed by granulating the drug substance with the binder hydroxypropyl 
cellulose and then coating these drug granules with an aqueous taste masking system: opadry YS-1-
19025-A (containing hypromellose 2910/6cP and macrogol/PEG 400) and surelease E-7-19040 ( 
containing ethylcellulose 20 cP (E462), ammonium hydroxide (E527), medium chain triglycerides and 
oleic acid). As the drug substance is known to be moisture sensitive the granulation of the drug 
substance is done using bottom spray fluid bed granulation. The coated granules are then blended with 
mannitol, crospovidone, thickening agents (microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose 
sodium), sweeteners (sucralose, magnasweet), banana flavour, and lubricant (magnesium stearate), 
followed by filling.  
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 9/57 
 
 
 
 
 
In-process controls during granulation, coating and drying for the product bed temperature and coating 
drying end point have been established, and are considered critical in-process controls. Product bed 
temperature determines granule particle size, an important parameter for maintaining acceptable 
content uniformity during blending, lubrication, re-blending, and sachet filling, as shown in the process 
risk assessment. Control of product bed temperature is achieved by modulation of inlet air temperature 
and spray rate within their established NORs. Coating drying end point is determined via loss-on-
drying (LOD) method, and assures moisture content suitable to meet product stability requirements. 
No process parameters were considered critical for the milling, blending, lubrication, and re-blending 
steps. Over the ranges established, the impact to CQAs was considered low by the applicant.  
For the sachet filling and sachet sealing processes, routine in-process controls for average net fill 
weight and leak testing have been established. These in-process controls are considered critical. 
Adequate in-process controls are in place. Proven acceptable ranges have been defined. The test 
methods and acceptance criteria are considered adequate.  
A summarised process validation protocol has been provided for commercial batches. The 
manufacturing process may be considered as a standard process in line with the draft guideline on 
process validation (CHMP/QWP/70287/2012). The data provided in the development section of the 
dossier demonstrate that the applicant has a good understanding of the process and the provided data 
show that the process is well controlled. Based on the provided information it is considered acceptable 
that no process validation data are provided to date. Instead the validation of the manufacturing 
process will take place prior to launching of the product unto the market. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, identity (HPLC, FTIR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.2.9.40), microbiological limits (Ph. Eur.2.6.12 and 2.6.13). All 
analytical methods have been adequately validated. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 10 batches (7 pilot batches and 3 production scale batches) 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. These batches were made with raltegravir manufactured at four different sites. 
The 3 production scale batches were manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacture site for 
the bulk blend. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 pilot size batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 24 
months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are representative to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The batches were 
manufactured with 3 different lots of active substance from two different sources.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, moisture, microbial quality, in-use 
stability, water activity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In-use stability was assessed for 3 batches of finished product stored for 12 month at 30 ºC / 75% RH 
and 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH by transferring the contents of a sachet into a sample cup, adding 5 
mL of water, dispersing the granules and holding the suspension in the sample cup for six hours. The 
sample is then tested for assay and degradation products. Suspension stability was demonstrated.

The lack of photostability data has been accepted based on the fact that no evidence of photolysis is 
reported for the active substance and on the fact that the product is packaged in light protecting foil 
sachets. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing 
process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of finished product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed in support of this application to extend the use of 
raltegravir to the treatment of paediatric patients of 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age. 
Pharmacokinetics 
During a definitive study, raltegravir was administered to the juvenile rat (n= 43 or 44/sex/group) via 
oral gavage at 0, 50, 200, or 600 mg/kg/day from post-natal day (PND) 5 to post-natal week (PNW) 8. 
In females, the systemic exposures to the parent compound were slightly higher than those observed 
in males; however, the observed differences were not significant.  Absorption of raltegravir was rapid, 
whereby the mean Cmax was observed at 0.5 hours post-dose.  Plasma elimination appeared to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 11/57 
 
 
 
 
 
biphasic and overall, drug elimination was rapid, whereby the mean concentrations were less than 2% 
of their respective Cmax values at 24 hours post-dose.  In general, exposures to raltegravir increased in 
a less than proportional manner with dose. 
The systemic exposures to the predominant metabolite, L-001277512, were similar in males and 
females. The mean Cmax was observed at 0.5 hours post-dose.  Plasma elimination appeared to be 
biphasic (as for the parent compound) and overall, elimination was rapid, whereby the mean 
concentrations were no greater than 8% of their respective Cmax values at 24 hours post-dose.  In 
general, AUC values for the metabolite increased in a less than proportional manner with dose and 
Cmax values were similar across the dose range evaluated.  The mean exposures to the metabolite 
were up to ~2-fold higher than those for the parent compound. 
Overall, the mean Cmax at 600 mg/kg/day observed during post-natal Week 7 was similar to that 
observed during a 5-week repeated-dose study in adult animals. 
Toxicology 
Raltegravir was administered to the juvenile rat (n= 43 or 44/sex/group) via oral gavage at 0, 50, 
200, or 600 mg/kg/day from post natal day (PND) 5 to post natal week (PNW) 8.  A total of 19 deaths 
were reported during the study; however, none of the deaths were considered to be treatment-related.  
The applicant suggested that there was no evidence of toxicity based on the incidence of mortality, the 
observed physical signs, body weights and developmental signs and haematology, serum biochemistry, 
ophthalmologic, behavioural assessment, and reproductive performance parameters. 
Treatment-related histopathological findings consisted of vacuolation of the non-glandular mucosa at 
the limiting ridge at ≥200 mg/kg/day as well as inflammation which occurred at ≥200 mg/kg/day and 
600 mg/kg/day in males and females, respectively.  This difference is thought to be related to the 
absolute amount of drug deposited directly on the stomach mucosa, which is higher in males (due to 
body weight).  Both vacuolar and inflammatory changes were considered reversible following cessation 
of treatment for approximately 6 weeks.  The mucosal epithelial vacuolation and associated increased 
inflammation were consistent with raltegravir-induced irritation (very slight) to the limiting ridge of the 
non-glandular stomach.  Moreover, the observed findings in juvenile animals were consistent with 
those observed in adult rats.  Based on the histopathological results, the no-effect level for treatment 
related changes in juvenile rats was 50 mg/kg/day. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00], a full environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been 
submitted.  The ERA report (dated June 2013) was signed off by Joan Griffith Tell, PhD who is 
employed by Merck & Co. Inc and has the appropriate training and experience in ecotoxicology. 
The maximum dosage of Raltegravir granules for suspension is 100 mg/day administered orally, twice 
daily.  Other forms and patient populations are allowed higher doses.  The typical adult dose is 400 mg 
administered orally, twice daily with or without food.  During coadministration with rifampin, the 
recommended dosage of Raltegravir is 800 mg twice daily with or without food (for a total of 1600 
mg/day).  For this assessment, in accordance with the guidance, the highest allowable dose is used.

2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed in support of this application to extend the use of 
raltegravir to the treatment of paediatric patients from the age of 4 weeks to < 2 years.  The data 
provided are considered to be sufficient to support the proposed use of raltegravir in paediatric 
patients from the age of 4 weeks to < 2 years.  
Data from the ERA provided suggests that raltegravir and/or its metabolites will not constitute a risk to 
the environment.

2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
A routine GCP inspection was conducted. The final report was dated 3 January 2014 and was 
forwarded to the Rapporteur on 7 January 2014. The inspection covered two sites in Johannesburg and 
one in Brazil. The inspection revealed no critical but 11 Major Findings. 
Regarding the Major Findings, with some occurring at each of the sites, a number were isolated and 
did not reflect a systemic issue. 
The major findings in monitoring, data management and clinical study report are interlinked and taking 
them together these non-compliances could affect the data quality. It should be noted that: 
−  Monitoring was based on a risk based approach and therefore only a proportion of the data were 
subjected to SDV (in some sites it could be less than a quarter).  
−  The sponsor relied on investigator site process for data entry. There was no QC check of the CRF 
against the data entered into the database to monitor data entry errors by the monitor. Only 
automated edit checks and ad hoc searches were performed by the sponsor. All grade 3 or above 
SAEs and laboratory abnormalities were recorded separately and correctly accounted for.

−  The protocol deviation list in the clinical study report was only a data dump extracted from the 
monitoring visit reports.  
The combinations of the Major Finding in monitoring, data management (lack of QC of data) and lack 
of process for clinical study reporting does not give confidence that the data for the submission was 
adequately assured. However, the inspectors could verify that adherence was adequately monitored 
and that the dosing, PK samplings, sample handling and the reporting of grade 3 or above EAEs and 
SAEs were adequate. The assessors should be mindful of the poor data management processes, the 
lack of SDV and the ongoing data verification/cleansing post submission.  
Based on the findings in this report, provided the CHMP accept the limitations mentioned, the 
inspectors can recommend that data from P1066 study to be used for further assessment. The 
inspectors have no recommendations for any follow up inspection for this application. 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Both clinical trials were conducted in accordance with current standard research approaches with 
regard to the design, conduct, and analysis of such trials including the archiving of essential 
documents.  These trials were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice guidelines and 
considerations for the ethical treatment of patients that were in place at the time the trials were 
performed.  Data presented in this raltegravir paediatrics application (4 weeks to <2 years) and 
information presented in this Clinical Overview were subject to audit by Merck Worldwide Quality 
Assurance Resources groups based on approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in effect at the 
time of the audit.  
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In studies 068 and 022 plasma samples were analysed for raltegravir concentrations by the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, AL). The analytical method used for the determination of 
raltegravir in human plasma was HPLC-MS/MS. The two validated procedures that were used had 
linear calibration ranges of 1 - 3000 ng/mL and 10 - 10,000 ng/mL. Bioanalytical reports have been 
provided. 
The formulations used in the two studies were: 
•  Adult tablets (100, 200 and 400 mg erodible tablet formulation). Only the 400 mg poloxamer 
tablet is actually approved for use. 
•  Chewable tablets [CT] (25, 50 and 100 mg unscored); only the 25 mg and 100 mg presentations 
were approved. The 100 mg CT used in study 068 was the same as that used in study 022. 
•  Oral granules for suspension (100 mg dissolved in 5 mL water to give 20 mg/mL) [GFS] 
Study 068 
This open label cross over study compared the three formulations intended for use in study P022 and 
also evaluated the effect of food on absorption after dosing with the CT. Subjects each received 4 
single dose (400 mg) treatments (see footnote to table below) in a randomised order with at least 4 
days of washout between each administration. PK samples were obtained over 72 h after each dosing. 
• 
Treatments A (adult tablet), B (CT) and C (GFS) were administered in the fasting state.  
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 15/57 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Treatment D (CT) was administered after a high fat breakfast of 827 kcal and 57% fat content.  
The AUC0-∞ and Cmax observed with the CT were higher than obtained with the marketed adult tablet 
and the two formulations were not bioequivalent.  
The oral suspension was not bioequivalent to the marketed adult tablet or to the chewable tablet. The 
GMRs for AUC0-∞ and Cmax observed with GFS were 2.6-fold and 4.6-fold higher than those obtained 
with the adult tablet and 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold higher than those obtained with the CT. The geometric 
mean C12h for the GFS was comparable to the values for the adult tablet and CT in the fasting state.

Figure 1  Arithmetic mean raltegravir plasma concentration-time profiles following single-dose 
administration of the RAL adult tablet, paediatric CT (fasted or fed) and oral granules in a liquid 
suspension to healthy adult, male and female subjects (N=12; inset = semilog scale) 
Administration of the CT with a high-fat meal (D) gave (compared with CT in fasting state B) an 
increase in C12hr (GMR 2.88 [90% CI 2.21, 3.75]), decrease in Cmax (0.38 [0.28, 0.52]), delay in Tmax 
(median 0.5 h fasted and 1 h fed) but comparable AUC0-∞ (0.94 [0.78, 1.14]). Dosing of the adult and 
CT formulations is recommended without regard to food in the respective SmPCs. Nevertheless, due to 
the increased variability in PK when dosing in the fed state the protocol for study 022 (see below) 
required dosing in the fasted state on days when full concentration-time PK profiles were obtained 
from Cohorts I-III. This allowed a direct comparison to adult PK data that were collected in the fasted 
state. 
The MAH stated that the GFS formulation uses the same coated granule that is in the CT so that after 
the tablet is chewed the formulations would essentially present to the stomach in a similar fashion, 
albeit with less flavors and sweeteners in the GFS. On this basis the MAH concludes that because the 
PK profiles of the CT and the GFS are similar there will be a clinically insignificant food effect on the 
GFS. Note that in contrast to Cohorts I-III, the intensive sampling PK data used for final dose selection 
in Cohorts IV and V were obtained without regard to food. 
Study 022 
The new paediatric PK data in the current X44G application come from Cohorts IV and V of study 022 
in children and adolescents. The study design is described in detail in the section on efficacy. Cohorts 
IV and V were the last age groups to be enrolled and received 6 mg/kg GFS twice daily.

For each of the three formulations the aim was to identify a dose regimen that would provide 
approximately the same plasma exposure to that achieved in adults using 400 mg poloxamer tablets 
BID. The initial protocol set a target minimum exposure for each cohort comprising a GM AUC0-12h 14 
to 25 μM·hr and concurrent GM C12h exceeding 33 nM (i.e. the IC95). Additionally, for safety reasons, 
the maximum AUC0-12h was to be < 45 μM·hr, which represents half the AUC0-24h observed when 1600 
mg was administered in Phase I adult studies. 
Subsequently, taking into account the additional information on the importance of C12hr for efficacy 
based on study 071 (400 mg BID vs. 800 mg QD in adults) the criteria used for dose selection in 
Cohorts IV and V were modified to target a GM AUC0-12h between 14 and 45 μM·hr and an approximate 
GM C12hr ≥ 75 nM. Dose adjustments for any subject with an AUC0-12hr ≥ 63 μM·hr were considered by 
the protocol team on a case by case basis and a repeat intensive PK visit was required.  
Intensive PK sampling was to be performed for all subjects in Stage I of each cohort. Initial intensive 
PK visits occurred between Days 5 and 12 following the first raltegravir dose. At these visits there was 
witnessed dosing at approximately 12 h after the previous dose and without regard to food. 
o  Cohort IV - 1 mL blood was collected at pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours post dose.  
o  Cohort V - 1 ml blood was collected pre-dose, at 0.5 h, between 3-5 h and between 8-10 h.  
A population PK model was used to determine if covariates (e.g. age, weight and sex) affected 
raltegravir PK and to derive estimated PK parameters AUC0-12hr, Cmax and C12hr at steady state for each 
patient.  
Sparse sampling was performed for all subjects in Stages I and II. Sparse sampling in Cohorts IV and 
V occurred between 10 and 14 h post-dose at Weeks 4 and 12. At Weeks 8 and 24 two samples were 
collected 2 h apart between 0.5 and 6 h (Week 8) or between 6 and 12 h (Week 24) post-dose.  
Results 
Intensive sampling PK data were initially obtained from four subjects in the mini-cohorts of each of 
Cohorts IV and V and from a total of 8 subjects in each Cohort.  
In Cohort IV using 6 mg/kg BID the GM AUC0-12hr (19.8 μM·hr) and C12 hr (108.2 nM) were within the 
target ranges. Two individual subjects had C12h < 75 nM (51 and 64 nM) and one other subject had 
AUC < 14 μM·hr (11 μM·hr) but no subject exceeded the upper limit set for the GM AUC (45 μM·hr).

The data from the mini-cohort of Cohort V gave GM an individual values within the required range. In 
May 2012 the protocol was amended to allow enrolment of up to 8 additional subjects in Cohort V 
Stage 1 to provide intensive sampling data and 4 had been enrolled when the study was closed to 
recruitment in February 2013. Three of these supplemental subjects in Cohort V provided intensive 
sampling data while taking 6 mg/kg while the fourth discontinued prior to the sampling day.  
For the total Cohort V the GM AUC0-12 h (22.3 μM·hr) and C12h values (116.6 nM; estimated from prior 
concentrations using the population PK model for the GFS formulation) fell within the predefined 
targets. There was one subject with an individual AUC < 14 μM·hr (10.5 μM·hr) but no subject had a 
value that exceeded 45 μM·hr. Three others had individual C12h < 75 nM (36, 50 and 62 nM).  
The graphical spread of AUC and C12h values by age and weight did not show any appreciable 
difference between Cohorts IV and V. The final dose selected was 6 mg/kg for both Cohorts IV and V.

As shown in the next tables the actual doses administered using the GFS ranged from 5.38 to 6.45 
mg/kg in Cohort IV and 5.10 to 7.14 mg/kg in Cohort V.  
From these tables, the CHMP noted that with a suspension containing 20 mg/mL the actual doses were 
based on measurements to the nearest half millilitre. There is no consistent relationship between 
actual mg/kg and AUC. In particular, the two youngest infants aged 1 and 2 months received 5.36 and 
6.15 mg/kg, respectively, and had corresponding AUCs of 39.7µM.h (the highest value in Cohorts IV 
and V) and 16.4 µM.h (in the lowest part of the range but above the minimum required).

Table 7 makes a comparison across the five Cohorts. The data obtained from Cohorts IV and V 
resemble the GM and %CV observed in children taking the CT. As observed previously the GM AUC 
values are comparable across the age range included in P022 while the GM C12h values are lower for 
the groups that received either CT or GFS vs. those who received the adult tablets.

The POP-PK model was a 2-compartment linear model with first order absorption based on P068 and 
P022 data from all subjects who received the GFS and CT formulations. Age, weight, BMI, BSA and 
gender were considered as covariates in the model (age, weight and BSA were highly correlated). The 
final model included an effect of weight on clearance, inter-compartmental flow rate and volume of 
distribution. Allometric scaling was used with a power of 0.75 for clearance and inter-compartmental 
flow rate and a power of 1 for volume of distribution. While maturation functions were explored to 
describe the influence of UGT1A1 activity on clearance in the youngest children incorporation of such a 
function did not improve the model fit vs. just including the effect of weight on clearance and volume 
of distribution. The MAH states that this is likely due to UGT1A1 activity being sufficiently high by 4 
weeks of age to allow the clearance to be adequately described by a relationship with weight.  
Post-hoc estimates of individual model parameters for patients in Cohorts IV and V were obtained 
using the final model and used to derive estimates of AUC0-12hr, Cmax, and C12hr at steady state for 
each subject. The MAH concluded that the estimates from the final model were generally consistent 
with expectations from the non-model based analysis described above and the analysis of intensive PK 
data.

Taste Evaluation 
An assessment of taste for the GFS was conducted using a questionnaire that was administered to 
care-givers either at Week 4 or at an early discontinuation visit, if patient discontinued earlier than 
Week 4. Some care-givers completed more than one taste evaluation, in which case the most recent 
assessment was used in the analysis. Overall 88% of the 26 care-givers completed at least one taste 
evaluation. The overall taste was considered average, good or very good by 74% and 83% reported no 
problems with taking the GFS. Vomiting or spitting was reported by 17%.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PK/PD analysis 
The following efficacy responses as documented in study 022 were considered for the PK/PD analysis: 
•  At least 1 log drop in HIV RNA or HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 24 
•  HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24 
To assess the effect of PK parameter (GM C12hr or GM Call) on the two efficacy endpoints a logistic 
regression model with PK parameter and baseline HIV RNA level as predictors was used. These two 
factors were assumed to have no interaction. No statistically significant PK/PD associations were 
observed for the various combinations of sparse PK parameters and <50 copies/mL at Week 24 in the 
analyses of data from Cohorts IV and V. When data were pooled across all five Cohorts statistically 
significant PK/PD associations were observed for all combinations of sparse PK parameters and efficacy 
measures when samples with values BLOQ were substituted with ½ LLOQ (i.e. 5 ng/mL or 11 nM) in 
the calculation of Call and GM C12hr.

calculated with BLOQ values treated as ½ the LLOQ) 
† Logistic regression with PK parameters (in log10 scale) and following covariates: baseline HIV RNA (log 10

§ N: number of patients with both PK and efficacy data. n: number of patients (out of N) with events. 
‡ The reliable estimate of Odds Ratio with corresponding p-value cannot be obtained due to the low number of 
subjects that failed this criteria. 
When BLOQ samples were treated as missing in the calculation of Call and GM C12hr no statistically 
significant PK/PD associations were observed for the various combinations of sparse PK parameters 
and efficacy measures in the pooled analysis, suggesting that the concentration ranges in Cohorts IV 
and V fall at the top of the exposure-response curve. 
In the viral dynamics model a simple Emax model was used to describe the dependence of viral 
inhibition on drug exposure with an in-vivo EC50 estimated from study 071 (3.5 ng/mL or 8 nM). The 
raltegravir concentration versus time profile was converted to a profile of percent viral inhibition versus 
time. By calculating the AUIC the average inhibition over the dosing interval was determined, from 
which a concentration can be calculated which would result in this same level of average inhibition over 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 25/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the dosing interval as if the concentration were held constant over the interval. This concentration is 
what the Sponsor terms the Equivalent Constant Concentration (ECC) and is the PK parameter which is 
used as the input in the viral dynamics model.  
In order to demonstrate that the PK profiles observed for Cohorts IV and V would be anticipated to 
result in efficacy similar to that obtained in adults with 400 mg BID and in paediatric subjects in 
Cohorts I-III, the full PK profiles for those dosed with the final recommended dose were used to 
calculate a distribution of steady state ECC values for each Cohort and the model was used to simulate 
the anticipated long-term efficacy for a combination regimen of raltegravir + NRTIs in treatment naïve 
HIV-infected patients with these PK profiles. The results were then compared to the observed results 
from the 400 mg BID arm of study 071 and from Cohorts I-III in P022. The mean ECC values and 
corresponding %CVs for each Cohort and for study 071 are shown in Table 14.

The Applicant concluded that the PK profiles observed with 6 mg/kg GFS in Cohorts IV and V should 
result in anti-viral efficacy very similar to that observed in adults taking the 400 mg BID dose. 
Conclusions on pharmacodynamics  
The PK/PD analysis has been conducted along the same lines as the analysis that was finally provided 
for the CT data. The non-model-based analyses that when BLOQ samples were treated as missing in 
the calculation of Call and GM C12hr no statistically significant PK/PD associations were observed for the 
various combinations of sparse PK parameters and efficacy measures in the pooled analysis, 
suggesting that the concentration ranges in Cohorts IV and V fall at the top of the exposure-response 
curve. 
In the viral dynamics model the mean ECC values and corresponding %CVs for each Cohort and for 
study 071 indicated similar findings for the GFS and CT formulations and both gave results that were 
less variable than the adult tablet. ECC values for all paediatric cohorts were more similar to those 
observed in the 400 mg BID arm of study 071 than the 800 mg QD arm.  
The analyses broadly support the Applicant’s conclusion that the PK profiles observed with 6 mg/kg 
GFS in Cohorts IV and V should result in anti-viral efficacy very similar to that observed in adults 
taking the 400 mg BID dose using the poloxamer tablets. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
P068 showed that the CT and the GFS exhibited less PK variability compared to the adult tablet, likely 
reflecting the differences in bioavailability. Whereas AUC was 2.6-fold higher for the GFS, Cmax was 
4.6-fold higher and C12hr was not substantially increased vs. adult tablets. This implies faster 
absorption for the GFS, which would be expected to result in a greater peak to trough fluctuation 
during steady-state dosing. However, intensive sampling showed that individual C12h values in 
Cohorts IV and V uncommonly fell below 75 nM and in only one case below 45 nM.  
Due to the results of study 071 the targets set for Cohorts IV and V were GM AUC0-12hr between 14 
and 45 µM•hr and GM C12hr ≥ 75 nM. The increase in the GM C12hr target was based on the finding 
that in 071 the 400 mg BID and 800 mg QD regimens gave comparable AUC0-24 hr but mean trough 
concentrations were 5-6 fold higher with BID dosing and correlated with the antiviral effect, such that 
subjects with values < 45 nM had the highest rate of virological failure. Aiming for a GM C12hr > 75 nM 
would result in the majority of subjects having individual values > 45 nM. 
The intensive and sparse PK analyses from P022 showed that ~ 6 mg/kg delivered via the GFS without 
regard to food (i.e. fasted state dosing on sampling days was not required) gave similar overall 
exposures compared to the adult tablet when given to older children but there was a higher Cmax and 
lower trough concentrations (GM C12hr ~ 108 to 117 nM for the GFS vs. 250 to 340 nM for the adult 
tablet). The PK profiles were comparable between the GFS in Cohorts IV and V and the CT in Cohorts 
IIB and III with GM AUC values 18-23 μM•hr (CT) and 20-22 μM•hr (GFS) and GM C12hr values of 71-
130 nM and 108-117 nM, respectively.  
Unlike the previous data from cohorts from older age groups, there were no obvious trends in PK by 
gender and gender was not a significant covariate in the population PK model. The intensive PK 
analysis showed a trend for oral clearance to increase with weight (and with age, which is highly 
correlated with weight) in the younger age groups, before levelling off in the older and heavier 
paediatric patients. This is consistent with the results of the population PK analysis of the GFS and CT, 
which indicate that raltegravir clearance and volume of distribution are a function of weight (again 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 28/57 
 
 
 
 
 
highly correlated with age) across the range studied in Cohorts IIB, III, IV and V. This provides further 
justification for the weight-based dosing using the chewable tablet/GFS in the younger (11 years and 
under) and less heavy (weight <25 kg) children but a fixed dose of 400 mg twice daily using the adult 
tablet for the adolescents (12 to 18 years) and heavier children (weight > 25 kg). 
While the GM Cmin values were 39 nM for Cohorts IV and 75 nM for Cohort V the range indicated that 
some subjects had values on occasion that were BLOQ (10 ng/mL or 22 nM), which were assigned a 
value of 11 nM (1/2 BLOQ) in some analyses.  
The intensive sampling data include 801525E (excluded from Cohort IV due to Kwashiorkor syndrome) 
and 8503642B (Cohort V) who inadvertently received 100 mg instead of 30 mg BID for 5 days pre-
sampling. 
In Cohort IV the intensive sampling data showed that the Kwashiorkor subject had two instances of < 
10 ng/mL (BLOQ; 22 nM) at 0h and at 12 h post-dose and another subject had one instance BLOQ at 
0h only. Note that these BLOQ values would have followed ingestion of the last non-witnessed dose 
scheduled for the previous evening. The subject with a sample BLOQ at 12 h after the witnessed dose 
had a concentration at 4 h that was well into the range of all other subjects, suggesting more rapid 
clearance of raltegravir between 4-12 h post-dose. If correct, then the BLOQ at 0h may not be due to 
non-adherence. The subject with BLOQ only at 0h had the lowest measurable 12 h concentration and 
again this may mean that BLOQ was not due to non-adherence. 
In Cohort V two subjects had 0h concentrations <BLOQ and these same two subjects had the lowest 
concentrations at 8-10 h. Hence it is possible that the BLOQ values do not represent non-adherence.  
Sparse sampling data showed that two subjects in Cohort IV had BLOQ values at Week 4 only, which 
could represent non-adherence. One in each Cohort had a BLOQ at Week 12 only - the Cohort V 
subject had rather typical values at all other visits while the Cohort IV subject had no sample for 3/6 
instances, which makes it difficult to comment further. Overall, there were few instances of values 
BLOQ in Cohorts IV and V. Not all of these BLOQ value may represent non-adherence. The intensive 
sampling data suggest that perhaps the subjects involved had faster clearance in the latter part of the 
dosing interval. This could represent natural variability but it may also be pertinent to understand 
whether the BSA of these children or the concomitant medications they were taking could be 
associated with the findings.  
The clearance of raltegravir in humans is mainly via UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. UGT1A1 
demonstrates polymorphism but dose adjustment is not required for subjects with reduced UGT1A1 
activity. In the responses to X24G the MAH reported studies to show that adult levels of UGT1A1 are 
attained by three to six months of age and that no differences in infant vs. adult transcript levels of 
UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 were observed when infant samples were placed into three age brackets (6-12, 
13-18 and 19-24 months). The table and graphical display of the Cohort V PK data by age showed the 
highest AUC in the youngest infant even though the actual dose given was 5.36 mg/kg. The possible 
effects of UGT levels in infants aged < 6 months should be addressed, taking into account that the age 
range in cohort V was 4-19 weeks but the mean and median were ~14-15 weeks.   
The evaluation of taste in adults was not favourable. In children aged < 2 years it is very difficult to 
understand how caregivers could evaluate the taste of the GFS. Spitting out the medicine or refusing it 
does not necessarily mean that the taste is poor just as swallowing it without apparent reaction does 
not mean it tastes good. Overall the CHMP places no reliance on the care-givers assessment. The only 
critical point is whether they were able to get the children to take the dose when scheduled and 
swallow it without vomiting. On this basis alone it seems likely that the GFS is an acceptable 
formulation. Overall, the PK data support a dose of 6 mg/kg but there are a few issues to address.

Additional issues during the assessment 
The MAH was asked to further explore the actual doses administered to children with C12hr and/or AUC 
values that fell below the population targets or below < 45 nM at trough, as listed in the table.  
Table 15 does not show an obvious trend when comparing the actual doses administered on a per kg 
basis in these subjects (5.35-6.17 mg/kg) compared to the range of doses received in the rest of the 
subjects in Cohorts IV and V (5.10-7.14 mg/kg). The two subjects with AUC0-12hr less than 14 uM*hr 
(PID 8501394 in Cohort IV and PID 801535 in Cohort V; Table 1) demonstrated adequate C12hr (110 
and 222 nM, respectively). However, since even in the “intensive sampling” patients the data points 
are inevitably limited, the Cmax and to some extent the other values can only be regarded as 
estimates.

Parameters for Subjects with Individual C12hr and AUC0-12hr Values Below the GM Targets

§ Model-based C12hr values derived from population PK model using model-estimated elimination rate constant and 
observed 8 hour concentration 
Target GM AUC0-12hr values were >14 μM•hr and <45 μM•hr; Target GM C12hr values were >75 nM. Bolded 
values are outside of the geometric mean targets. 
Table 16 lists the children with at least one sparse sampling value BLOQ. Only 1 of the 4 subjects (PID 
8501806) with a BLOQ sparse PK sample also had a C12hr value below the GM target during intensive 
PK, as shown in Table 1. This patient’s AUC0-12hr was on the higher end of the range, at 28 uM*hr. 
Furthermore, 3 of 4 patients showed favourable virologic efficacy as shown by the steep decline in HIV 
RNA (copies/mL) from baseline to the week with a BLOQ value: PID 382192 (BL: 135,016; Week 4: 
1,880), PID 2020164 (BL: 10,000,000; Week 4: 8,637), PID 8501806 (BL: 18,385; Week 12: 51,560) 
and PID 801538 (BL: 10,000,000; Week 12: 1,290).

Values Were Observed in Cohorts IV and V in IMPAACT P1066 Following Sparse PK Sampling 
§ Model-based C 12hr values derived from population PK model using model-estimated elimination rate constant and 
observed 8 hour concentration 
† For PID 801538, a dose of 30 mg was administered during the intensive PK sampling. 
Note that PID 8501806 actually had an increase in viral load from an unusually low baseline (18,385) 
to 51,560 at Week 12. The intensive sampling PK data from this patient suggested no problem with 
absorption based on levels in the early samples but showed an unusually fast decline from 4 h to 12 h. 
This patient, who was 8 months old, could have had unusually high UGT levels that could have been 
the result of induction by one or more concomitant medications.  
Indeed, all seven of the children listed in Table 1 were taking LPV/r during the study. However, since 
65% of all patients in the study were taking LPV/r it is not possible to draw any conclusions about an 
association between use of LPV/r and virological response from these observations.  
With regard to UGT levels, which are reported to reach adult levels at around 3-6 months of age, the 
MAH stated that Data from Cohorts IV and V suggested at most a weak trend between raltegravir AUC 
and age. However, the claim cannot be regarded as substantiated when there is no discussion of 
factors other than age that could impact on raltegravir clearance. There is a need to further explore 
the potential reasons for PK values BLOQ or, at least, below the pre-defined population thresholds 
(which can be used as a benchmark) as well as C12h values < 45 nM. 
The question arose from the prior responses, in which it was considered that the MAH had not 
considered whether some patients could have had faster clearance that could be related to their level 
of UGT expression and whether induction of UGT by co-administered medications (such as 
lopinavir/ritonavir; LPV/r; Kaletra; which was taken by 65% of patients in the study) could have 
influenced PK.  
The CHMP considered the MAH’s responses adequate; however no assessment of the real reasons for 
the variability between subjects and within subjects over time was provided. The CHMP considered to 
not pursuing this issue further. 
The revisions to section 4.2 of the SmPC further clarified the use of the GFS up to a maximum 100 mg 
BID. Although the MAH could have calculated GFS doses for higher weights to allow an alternative to 
the CT in heavier children there is no major objection to this limit. 
However, an additional point concerned the fact that the US FDA approved the GFS formulation in 
December 2013. The dose recommendations approved in the US are not exactly those used in the 
study and as proposed for the EU SmPC since they have been simplified into weight bands that round 
up to nearest half or whole millilitre volumes. The tabulation is also useful since it displays the doses

for the GFS and CT in parallel (note that the doses for the CT are the same between the approved EU 
and US prescribing information). 
During the responses to questions, the MAH had revised the dosing table for the oral suspension so 
that dosing limits were based on weights and not additionally restricted by age. This was considered 
appropriate. It was also clarified that children of 12-20 kg could take either the GFS or the CT 
depending on preference. The dosing table, based on the study, was as follows:

However, it was noted that the dose recommendations approved in the US were not exactly those used 
in the study and as proposed for the EU SmPC since they have been simplified into weight bands that 
round up to nearest half or whole millilitre volumes as follows:

8 to less than 11 
11 to less than 14† 
14 to less than 20† 
20 to less than 25 
*The weight-based dosing recommendation for the chewable tablet and oral suspension is based on approximately 
6 mg/kg/dose twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
†For weight between 11 and 20 kg either formulation can be used. 
Note: The chewable tablets are available as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. 
‡The 100 mg chewable tablet can be divided into equal halves. 
3 x 25 mg twice daily 
1 x 100 mg twice daily 
1.5 x 100 mg‡ twice daily 
The tabulation appeared to be potentially very useful because it displayed the doses for the GFS and 
CT in parallel (the doses for the CT are the same between the approved EU and US prescribing 
information). 
Since the US table along with the parallel dosing for oral suspension and CT seemed appealing the 
MAH was asked to explain how the US simplified dose recommendations were derived and to discuss 
why they had not been proposed for the EU SmPC.  
The modifications to the oral suspension regimens as adopted in the US will mostly slightly increase 
the dose, which is better for efficacy. The small modifications do not seem at all likely to impact on 
safety, taking into account also that a relationship between plasma exposures and specific AEs has not 
been identified.

Therefore, the CHMP considered that the US version is an improvement and that the most recent 
modifications that have been made by the MAH to all three SmPCs (i.e. poloxamer tables, CT and 
suspension) are accepted. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD analysis has been conducted along the same lines as the analysis that was finally provided 
for the CT data. The non-model-based analyses that when BLOQ samples were treated as missing in 
the calculation of Call and GM C12hr no statistically significant PK/PD associations were observed for the 
various combinations of sparse PK parameters and efficacy measures in the pooled analysis, 
suggesting that the concentration ranges in Cohorts IV and V fall at the top of the exposure-response 
curve. 
In the viral dynamics model the mean ECC values and corresponding %CVs for each Cohort and for 
study 071 indicated similar findings for the GFS and CT formulations and both gave results that were 
less variable than the adult tablet. ECC values for all paediatric cohorts were more similar to those 
observed in the 400 mg BID arm of study 071 than the 800 mg QD arm.  
The analyses broadly support the MAH’s conclusion that the PK profiles observed with 6 mg/kg GFS in 
Cohorts IV and V should result in anti-viral efficacy very similar to that observed in adults taking the 
400 mg BID dose using the poloxamer tablets. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant submitted a report on study 022 (also referred to as P1066 or IMPAACT) dated 6 June 
2013. This open-label study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 and subjects were enrolled at 43 
sites across N. and S. America and Southern Africa. The data cut-off date for the preparation of the 
current study report was the LPLV date 7 February 2013. The updated report provided data up to 
maximum Week 48 for Cohorts IV and IV and longer-term data up to maximum Week 240 on subjects 
previously enrolled into Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III. 
Study 022 
This was a multi-centre, open-label, non-comparative study in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 
ages ≥ 4 weeks to < 19 years of age to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of raltegravir 
when administered in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR). Subjects were 
stratified into six cohorts based on five age groups and three formulations as follows: 
Cohort I:  
 12 to < 19 years - adult tablets 
Cohort IIA:  
 6 to < 12 years - adult tablets 
Cohort IIB:  
 6 to < 12 years - chewable tablets (CT) 
Cohort III:  
 2 to < 6 years - chewable tablets 
Cohort IV:  
 6 months to < 2 years - oral granules for suspension (GFS) 
Cohort V:  
 4 weeks to < 6 months - oral granules for suspension 
The study consisted of sequential Stages I and II within each Cohort. In Stage I the background ARV 
was optimised after sampling for PK evaluation. The starting dose of raltegravir was administered to 
the first 4 in each cohort (i.e. a mini-cohort) before expanding to the full cohort and then to the next 
youngest cohort. PK and short-term safety were again assessed before deriving a final dose

recommendation for Stage II, which involved raltegravir dosing for 48 weeks with an optimised 
background ARV regimen. 
Eligibility for inclusion in Cohort IV required therapy to interrupt maternal-infant transmission and/or 
treat HIV infections. Eligibility for inclusion in Cohort V required therapy to interrupt maternal-infant 
transmission but no other anti-HIV treatment. Subjects must have had ≤ 1 log drop in HIV RNA within 
12 weeks prior to the screening visit or screening HIV RNA ≥ 25,000 copies/mL (with the exception of 
patients who had not received ARV therapy for ≥ 4 weeks prior to entry). HIV RNA was to be ≥ 1,000 
copies/mL at the screening visit. 
Cohorts IV and V received oral granules for suspension twice daily at 6 mg/kg. The oral granules (100 
mg) were suspended in 5 mL of water for a 20 mg/mL final concentration.  
Efficacy measurements included HIV RNA, CD4 cell counts and percentages and viral resistance 
testing. In Cohorts IV and V all HIV RNA determinations used the Abbott Real Time HIV-1 platform. 
HIV RNA was measured at screening, entry, Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 at the 14-day post 
therapy follow-up visit and at any early discontinuation visits. During long-term follow-up HIV RNA was 
measured every 4 months (± 6 weeks) for up to 5 years from enrolment.  
The All Treated population included all who received a dose of raltegravir. The Final Dose population 
included those who received only the final selected dose. In Cohorts IV and V all subjects received the 
final dose. Subjects reaching 2 years of age and after 48 weeks could switch from the GFS to the CT 
but were still included in all Cohort IV and V displays. However, at the time of database lock no 
Cohorts IV and V subjects had transitioned to the CT. 
The modified definition of virological failure was as follows: 
1) never achieved ≥ 1 log drop from baseline in plasma HIV RNA or HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL through 
Week 24 
or 
2) virological rebound at Week 24 or later defined as (a) confirmed HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL (on 2 
consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart) after initial response with HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL 
or (b) confirmed > 1.0 log10 increase in HIV RNA above nadir level (on 2 consecutive measurements at 
least 1 week apart). Nadir was defined as the lowest HIV RNA by the evaluated time point. 
Results for Cohorts IV and V 
There were 26 treated subjects, including 18 enrolled at three sites in S. Africa, of which 23 completed 
at least 24 weeks of treatment and 21 completed the Week 48 visit or had discontinued before that 
date.

The mean baseline log 10 plasma HIV RNA was 5.7 log 10 copies/mL and 18 (69.2%) had > 100,000 
copies/mL vs. only 8.3% in Cohorts I-III. Just over half (57.7%; 15/26) were infected with non-clade 
B but 5 had no viral subtype designation. Three were classified as CDC clinical category B HIV infection 
and three as category C. Almost all had at least one secondary diagnosis (11/14 Cohort IV and 11/12 
Cohort V, mostly involving infections and infestations, including three cases of AIDS encephalopathy in 
Cohort IV and the most common diagnosis was oral candidiasis (34.6%). 
All 14 in Cohort IV had been previously treated with ARV for a mean of 20.1 weeks, and had received a 
mean of 2.1 prior agents. Most Cohort IV subjects had previously used NRTIs (64.3%) and NNRTIs 
(57.1%, all as nevirapine) while 35.7% had received PIs (35.7%) all as lopinavir/ritonavir. Most Cohort 
V subjects had received prior NNRTI (91.7%, all as nevirapine), 25% had received prior NRTI (all as 
zidovudine) and none had prior use of PIs. No data are available on the mother’s PMTCT regimens. 
Based on GSS the baseline treatment contained 2 or more active ARV agents in 13/14 in Cohort IV 
while the other subject had no GSS available at baseline. In Cohort V baseline treatment contained 2 
or more active ARV agents in 7/12 (58.4%) while GSS was missing for 5 subjects. At study entry the 
ARV was adjusted or initiated according to treatment history and baseline resistance data (or using 
data from the maternal virus if available). The most frequently reported (25%) ARVs used included 
lamivudine (100%), abacavir (73.1%), lopinavir/ritonavir (65.4%) and zidovudine (26.9%). LPV/r was 
used in 12 Cohort IV and 5 Cohort V subjects. 
Based on sachet counts, 80.7% had at least 90% adherence to raltegravir during the study, and none 
had < 70% adherence in this age group that required care-givers to ensure dosing. 
Based upon the OF approach > 85% in each cohort had ≥1 log drop in HIV RNA or HIV RNA < 400 
copies/mL at Week 24. There were 6/13 (46.2%) and 3/8 (37.5%) in respective cohorts with < 50 
copies/mL at Week 24. The mean drop in HIV RNA was by 3.1 log10 copies/mL, the mean CD4 cell 
count increased by 500 cells/mm3 and the mean CD4 percentage increased by 7.5%. The response 
rates using the NC=F approach were the same as for the OF approach at week 24.

log10 drop from baseline and >=400 copies/mL; otherwise patients with missing values were excluded. 
-For continuous endpoints (e.g. change from baseline in CD4 cell counts and percent), baseline values were carried 
forward for patients missing data due to discontinuation of study treatment for lack of efficacy or for non-treatment 
related reasons with last available HIV RNA value < 1 log10 drop from baseline and >=400 copies/mL; otherwise 
patients with missing values were excluded.

The Week 48 results did not show any interpretable changes from Week 24. The NC=F results included 
only one extra subject and were closely comparable to the OF approach.  Sustained responses were 
observed in 85% (17/20; OF) and 81% (NC=F; 17/21) at week 48. Not all subjects had reached Week 
48 but of those who did 13/14 in Cohort IV and 4/6 in Cohort V still met the response criteria. 
Proportions with < 50 copies/mL increased gradually up to Weeks 24 and 36 reaching just over 50% in 
each cohort and overall by Week 48. 
Proportions with < 400 copies/mL increased more quickly within the first 8 weeks, representing very 
substantial early drops in viral load 
In these young paediatric subjects the mean and median baseline CD4 counts were around 1500 
cells/mm3 although the range was from 131-3648 cells/mm3. In Cohort IV the increases in CD4 counts 
were generally of lesser magnitude than Cohort V but the difference from baseline reached ~300 
cells/mm3 by Week 8 and then hovered between 200-400 cells/mm3 up to Week 48. Despite the 
considerable variability in Cohort V data there was also a very rapid increase in the first 4-8 weeks of 
treatment. 
The mean change from baseline in CD4 percent over time reflected the early increment in the absolute 
CD4 cell counts. The overall data indicated that mean changes did not exceed ~10%. 
Outcomes by baseline characteristics were not explored for Cohorts IV and V due to the small numbers 
enrolled.

In Cohort IV there were 4 subjects with virological failure (as defined in the protocol) that occurred 
between Weeks 24 and 48 and all were rebounders. Based on sachet counts adherence was over 90% 
in these 4 subjects who failed. No subject in Cohort V had a virological failure. One additional Cohort IV 
subject experienced rebound at Week 96.

Genotypic Test. 
N = Number of virologic failure patients with integrase mutation test done in each cohort. 
n (%) = Number (percent) of patients in each subcategory. 
Because of limited blood volumes genotypic data are available for 2/4 subjects with virological failure. 
Virus from one subject had a mutation at AA155 (without other raltegravir associated resistance 
mutations) but the other virus tested had no known raltegravir mutations. No baseline phenotypic data 
were available for those who failed therapy and had resistance testing. The virus with the mutation at 
AA155 showed reduced phenotypic susceptibility at the time of failure. 
Long Term Efficacy for Cohorts I-III 
For the evaluation of long-term efficacy data from Cohorts I-III (subjects aged 2 - < 18 years at 
enrolment) separate analyses were performed for the Final Dose population (96) and the All Treated 
population (126).  
By the 07-Feb-2013 cut-off date all subjects in Cohorts I, IIA and IIB had completed the Week 144 
study visit or had already discontinued. For the Cohort III Final Dose subset 50% (10/20) had 
completed treatment at least up to Week 144. Across the 96 Final Dose subjects 64 (66.7%) had 
completed treatment at least up to Week 144 and 7 had completed to Week 240. Among the 35 
(36.5%) subjects that had discontinued treatment by the data cut-off the most common reason was 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 37/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-adherence (13 in Cohort I; 13.5%). Overall 17/96 (17.7%) had discontinued the study altogether 
and the most common reason was unwillingness to adhere to study requirements (7 in Cohort I; 
7.3%).  
Based on the OF approach in Cohorts I-III after 144 weeks of treatment 62% had at least one log drop 
in HIV RNA or HIV RNA <400 copies/mL, 47.9% had <50 copies/mL and 57.7% had < 400 copies/mL. 
These overall rates are driven by the relatively low percentages in the largest Final Dose Cohort (I) 
with higher rates in the small numbers in each of the younger Cohorts. The overall mean increases at 
Week 144 from baseline in CD4 cell count and percent were 58.1 cells/mm3 and 4.6%, respectively. 
The negative mean change in counts in two Cohorts seems to be driven by one or a few individuals 
based on the range. 
Using the NC=F approach for the Final Dose population the proportion meeting the response criteria 
falls to 52% and, as for the OF, is lowest in the adolescents (Cohort I). Also, 40% had < 50 copies/mL 
and 48% < 400 copies/mL. 
The All Treated population for both methods of analysis gave results across Cohorts that were similar 
to those reported for the Final Dose population. The table presents virological failures up to Week 144 
for Cohorts I-III in the All Treated population. 
Of the 49 who had failed by Week 144 and had genotypic data there were 18 subjects across all 
cohorts with viruses that displayed signature raltegravir genotypic mutations. Six of the 31 viruses 
with non-signature raltegravir mutations had other mutations known to confer raltegravir resistance 
and 25 had mutations with no known raltegravir resistance. 
Phenotypic sensitivity (IC50 fold change compared to the wild-type reference) of viruses isolated at 
baseline and after virological failure showed that baseline samples displayed mean and median IC50 
fold-change of 1.0 and 1.0 (range 0.7 to 1.5), respectively, indicating phenotypic susceptibility. After 
virological failure there were mean and median fold-changes in IC50 of 34.8 and 1.0 (range 0.6 to 
150.2). Per Monogram Biosciences, a fold change IC50>1.5 is above the technical assay cut-off and 
suggests the possibility of true raltegravir resistance. 
Finally, an appended table lists all the raltegravir phenotypic and genotypic resistance data for those 
who failed in Cohorts I-III up to the February 2013 cut-off date. Compared to the Table shown above 
for Weeks 0-144 the assessor counted: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
33 in Cohort I of which 2 were non-responders (vs. 25 shown above) 
10 in Cohort IIA of which all were rebounders (vs. 9 shown above) 
8 in Cohort IIB of which one was a non-responder (vs. 7 shown above) 
9 in Cohort III of which 2 were non-responders (vs. 8 shown above) 
Therefore the total number that failed in Cohorts I-III increases from 49 to 60 but most of the 
difference is in the adolescents. Almost all those who failed had previously met the criteria for a 
virological response and were therefore classed as rebounders.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Cohorts IV and V 
Initiation of a regimen containing raltegravir achieved a very marked drop in viral load and by Week 24 
20/22 met the response criteria although only 9/21 (43%) had < 50 copies/mL. Despite the relatively 
high baseline CD4 counts (vs. older HIV infected) in the majority of subjects in these Cohorts the mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 38/57 
 
 
 
 
 
CD4 cell count increased by 500 cells/mm3. There was no substantial change by Week 48 (but only 
7/12 in Cohort V had data available to Week 48 in the CSR) by which time 10/19 with data had < 50 
copies/mL.  
The numbers in these two youngest Cohorts are too small to draw firm conclusions regarding efficacy 
and the Applicant did not look at outcomes by various factors due to the total study sample size. 
However, it is notable that at Week 24 across the Final Dose subjects in Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III the 
OF approach showed that 71.6% met the response criteria while the proportion with <50 copies/mL 
was 53.7%. Also, the two pivotal Phase 3 studies in treatment-experienced adults gave response rates 
at the HIV RNA <50 copies/mL level for raltegravir plus OBT that were 62% at Week 48 and 57% at 
Week 96. Therefore, broadly speaking, the data for Cohorts IV and V are in keeping with those in older 
subjects.  
There have been 5 subjects in Cohort IV with rebound from Week 36 onwards but there are too few 
data to interpret the possible reasons. In addition, there are few data on the range of rebound rates 
that can be expected in this age group that could be used to place the results in some perspective. The 
high risk for de novo class resistance during suboptimal treatment should be more emphasized in the 
SmPC, therefore the CHMP considered that the subheading “resistance” in section 5.1 needed an 
update to reflect that clinical practice full cross resistance to elvitegravir, and for a substantial 
proportion a negative impact on the efficacy of dolutegravir can be observed. In addition, it was 
considered necessary to indicate the number of patients with virological failure in the efficacy 
outcomes tables in the SmPC.  
Cohorts I-III 
Overall 64/96 (66.7%) Final Dose subjects had data at least up to Week 144. Among 35 subjects that 
had discontinued treatment by the data cut-off the most common reason was non-adherence (13 in 
Cohort I; 13.5%). Also, 17/96 (17.7%) had discontinued the study altogether and the most common 
reason was unwillingness to adhere to study requirements (7 in Cohort I; 7.3%). This picture points to 
some of the difficulties in treating adolescent subjects. 
Generally, for those who were followed up the rates with virological response (62%) and < 50 
copies/mL (47.9%) do not point to marked loss of efficacy vs. Week 48. In the Final Dose population 
49 had failed by Week 144 but the difference vs. Week 48 was mainly driven by Cohort I. Overall, 18 
of the subjects with genotypic data had viruses that displayed signature raltegravir genotypic 
mutations. Almost all those who failed had previously met the criteria for a virological response and 
were therefore classified as rebounders.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study 022 was not designed to provide definitive evidence of efficacy. For Cohorts I-III it was observed 
that the response rates and the percentages that achieved < 50 copies/mL and sustained these 
responses to at least Week 48 were in keeping with several other studies using different regimens in 
children of these age groups. For Cohorts IV and V it can only be observed in such small numbers and 
with limited follow-up that the data do not point to any major concerns. Taking together the PK, PK/PD 
and efficacy data, such as they are, a dose of approximately 6 mg/kg could be accepted.  
The doses achieved using the protocol will fairly closely approximate 6 mg/kg for body weights up to 
about 11.6 kg. There is more variability between 11.6 to 14 kg (80 mg vs. calculated 70-84 mg) and 
for the 14-20 kg range the dose of 100 mg is rather more of a compromise vs. the calculated doses, 
which would be from 84-120 mg. Since no child switched to the CT but weights and doses did increase 
the applicant justified these mg/kg dose ranges vs. the target of ~6 mg/kg based on the actual 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 39/57 
 
 
 
 
 
numbers who received these doses and their PK data. The applicant proposal for parallel dosing for oral 
suspension and CT seemed appealing. The modifications to the oral suspension regimens will mostly 
slightly increase the dose, which is better for efficacy. The small modifications do not seem at all likely 
to impact on safety, taking into account also that a relationship between plasma exposures and specific 
AEs has not been identified. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the modifications that have been made by the MAH to all three 
SmPCs (i.e. poloxamer tables, CT and suspension) are acceptable. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
The primary purpose of this paediatric application was to provide 24 and 48 week data from IMPAACT 
P1066 in children aged from 4 weeks to <2 years (n=26) that demonstrate the favourable safety 
profile of raltegravir GFS at doses proposed dosing recommendations.  
The main focus of this application was on new safety data from Cohorts IV and V. Longer-term safety 
data from the Final Dose population of Cohorts I-III (67 adult tablet and 33 CT) was also provided.  
The approach in the safety evaluation for infants and toddlers included in Cohorts IV and V was similar 
to that used in the paediatric application in children from 2 to 18 years. A review of the overall adverse 
event profile, serious adverse events (SAE), adverse events Grade 3 or greater, events considered by 
the investigator as potentially related to raltegravir use, and events leading to treatment 
discontinuation was included. A review of safety by demographic subgroup (i.e., gender, race and 
ethnicity) was not performed due to the modest size of the study population. 
Experience with off-label paediatric use of raltegravir was limited to the commercially available adult 
400 mg tablet. A literature review of paediatric raltegravir use was also conducted and in addition, the 
Applicant reviewed the post-marketing safety database for reports of paediatric use, from 31-Dec-2010 
through 31-Dec-2012. 
Patient exposure 
For Cohorts IV and V the exposure up to the February 2013 cut-off date is shown below.

For Cohorts I and IIA (adult tablet) and Cohorts IIB and III (CT) the mean (range) number of days on 
raltegravir was 1052 (28 to 1702) days and 948 (250 to 1317) days, respectively. Overall, 39/67 
(58.2%) and 18/33 (54.5%) in respective Cohorts exceeded 144 weeks. Total daily doses in Cohorts 
IIB and III ranged from 75 to 300 mg twice daily. 
Adverse events  
In Cohorts IV and V by Week 24 all subjects had at least one clinical AE and 7 had at least one SAE. 
Summary of clinical adverse events by cohort (IV and V); Week 0-48 
N = Number of patients in each cohort. 
n (%) = Number (percent) of patients in each subcategory. 
Events were included if they occurred while on study drug or within 14 days after discontinuation of study drug. 
*Drug related adverse events were determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to 
raltegr avir. 
Complete Week 48 data (Patient was on study treatment to at least Rel Day 295) is available for 58.3% (7/12) of 
Cohort V patients. 
By Week 48 one additional subject had at least one SAE and one additional subject had at least one 
Grade 3 AE. Up to February 2013 one subject had a SAE of gastroenteritis at Day 415 and died on Day 
418. This subject had reported Grade 3 wheezing and dyspnoea prior to Week 24 and then had Grade 
3 gastroenteritis along with Grade 3 diarrhoea and vomiting reported on Day 415.  
Up to Week 24 the most frequently reported AEs were cough (53.8%), nasal congestion (42.3%), 
diarrhoea (38.5%), rash (38.5%), pyrexia (30.8%), pharyngitis (30.8%) and rhinorrhoea (30.8%). 
Among all AEs some events might be considered as CDC Category A events for mildly symptomatic HIV 
infection in infants/toddlers (<2 years of age), although these were not formally assessed as such. 
These events include respiratory disorders, otitis media, failure to thrive, dermatitis, oral candidiasis, 
pneumonia, lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly. 
Up to Week 48 there were small increases in numbers reporting some specific AEs but the general 
pattern of commonest AEs remained the same as shown below.

All Clinical Adverse Events by Cohort (IV and V); (Incidence >=15% in One or More 
Cohorts); Weeks 0-48 
N = Number of patients in each cohort. 
n (%) = Number (percent) of patients in each subcategory. 
Events were included if they occurred while on study drug or within 14 days after discontinuation of study drug. 
Adverse event terms are from MedDRA Version 15.1. 
Although a patient may have had two or more occurrences of a specific adverse event, the patient is counted only 
once for that adverse event. If a patient has more than one adverse event within a System Organ Class, the patient 
is counted once for each specific adverse event but only once in the System Organ Class row. 
Complete Week 48 data (Patient was on study treatment to at least Rel Day 295) is available for 58.3% (7/12) of 
Cohort V patients. 
Grade 3 or greater clinical adverse events had been reported by 6 subjects (23.1%) at Week 48. One 
of these events (staphylococcal abscess) occurred between Weeks 24 and 48. This subject also had a 
SAE of abdominal abscess.

Complete Week 48 data (Patient was on study treatment to at least Rel Day 295) is available for 58.3% (7/12) of 
Cohort V patients. 
There were 2 drug-related Grade 3 or greater events that occurred in a single subject up to the data 
cut-off date and both occurred by Week 24. These events of drug eruption (diagnosis) and allergic 
dermatitis (symptom) occurred in a 17-week old child in Cohort V with onset on Day 7. The events 
were considered possibly drug related and resulted in discontinuation. However, this child also had 
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP] (considered not related to study therapy) 1 day prior to the 
onset of the drug-related rash and concomitant treatment included other agents that are associated 
with rash (including benzyl penicillin, cefotaxime, vancomycin and co-trimoxazole) as well as the ARV. 
Also the MAH considered that immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS) could explain new onset of PCP 
within one week of starting therapy and immediately before the episode of rash. 
AEs of special interest included: 
o  Eight (30.8%) reported metabolism and nutrition disorders, including 9 occurrences of 
decreased appetite and failure to thrive but none was Grade 3 or greater.   
o  One infant who had received BCG at birth had Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) IRS reported 4 
weeks after initiating raltegravir, abacavir and lamivudine. The subject had no significant 
clinical or laboratory abnormalities (Grade 2 or higher) at the time of diagnosis and the event 
was not considered serious or drug related. It had resolved by Week 24 despite continuing 
study treatment. 
o  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported in 13/26 (50%) up to February 2013. 
Those with rash were taking NRTIs and other agents such as co-trimoxazole and none was 
taking darunavir.

o  Two non-serious AEs of pruritus were reported (eye pruritus and ear pruritus) but were not 
Grade 3. 
o  Two subjects had Grade 2 ALT elevations and one had a Grade 2 AST elevation that did not 
worsen or result in study drug discontinuation. 
o  There was one non-serious AE of hepatomegaly that was not Grade 3 or greater. 
o  Gastrointestinal disorders were reported in 18 (69.2%) up to February 2013. The most 
frequently reported were diarrhoea (14/26, 53.8%) and vomiting (7/26, 26.9%).  
In Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III (Final Dose) up to Week 144 clinical AEs of Grades 1–4 were 
reported by 92.7% and 21.9% reported at least one SAE (including the previously reported subject 
with 3 drug-related SAEs of abnormal behaviour, psychomotor hyperactivity and insomnia that did not 
lead to discontinuation). There were 7 new SAEs and 10 new AEs of at least Grade 3 reported since 
Week 48 but none was considered drug-related. No subjects had discontinued due to AEs or died.  
The most frequently reported AEs were cough (58.3%), pyrexia (47.9%), rhinorrhoea (38.5%), nasal 
congestion (37.5%), vomiting (29.2%), oropharyngeal pain (28.1%) and headache (27.1%).  
Grade 3 or greater clinical adverse events were reported by 26% in Cohorts I-III and 12 additional 
subjects reported such AEs after Week 48. Overall 15.6% reported such AEs in the Infections and 
Infestations SOC and the most frequently reported (3%) included pyrexia, pneumonia, and influenza-
like illness. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In Cohorts IV and V SAEs had been reported by 7 subjects up to Week 24 and 8 by Week 48. 
Dyspnoea was reported in 2 but all other SAEs were reported in a single subject.

Serious Clinical Adverse Events by Cohort (IV and V); (Incidence >0% in one or more 
cohorts); Weeks 0-48 
One of these SAEs was the Grade 3 drug-related allergic rash, which led to discontinuation of study 
drug (see above). Raltegravir was discontinued as it was believed to be related to the worsening rash 
but other ARVs were continued. The generalised erythematous rash was reported as 
recovered/resolved after one week and PCP (severe) after two weeks.  
From 24-48 weeks there was only one additional SAE – the case of abdominal abscess considered not 
related (see above). One further SAE was reported up to the cut-off date. This was the case mentioned 
above of gastroenteritis resulting in death.   
In Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III by Week 144, 21/96 Final Dose subjects had reported at least one SAE. 
There were 7 new SAEs reported since Week 48. None was considered related to raltegravir by the 
investigator or led to discontinuation. By the cut-off date, 29 (23%) All Treated subjects had reported 
SAEs, mostly in the Infections and Infestations SOC (19 subjects). The previously reported case of 
agitation not considered to be related to study therapy had since been admitted to a detention centre 
and discontinued from study therapy. There were no drug related SAEs reported after Week 144. 
Laboratory findings 
In Cohorts IV and V laboratory AEs of any grade were reported by 88.5% of subjects by Week 24 but 
no-one discontinued. Laboratory SAEs were reported in 2 (7.7%) but were not considered drug 
related. Grade 3 or greater laboratory AEs occurred in 4 subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 45/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One subject in Cohort IV had two AES with onset on Day 76 (non-drug related SAE of hypoglycaemia, 
non-drug related AE of blood bilirubin increased, Grade 3 drug-related AE of blood glucose decreased 
and Grade 3 drug-related AE of blood bilirubin increased). After database lock, the site updated the 
causality for both Grade 3 events to non-treatment related. 
Up to Week 48 there was one additional laboratory AE in a Cohort V subject, which was non-serious 
and not of Grade 3 or 4. Up to the cut-off date the laboratory safety profile on review of all available 
Cohort IV and V data was generally similar across both cohorts to those at Weeks 24 and 48. 
Laboratory AEs were reported in 92.3% and the most frequently reported included blood potassium 
increased (38.4% [10/26]; 9/10 were Grade 1), neutrophil count decreased (34.6% [9/26]); no Grade 
4) and blood sodium decreased (30.8% [8/26]; all Grade 1). 
Grade 3 or greater laboratory AEs were reported in 4 (15.4%) subjects up to Week 24 of which two 
involved neutrophil count decreased. None of these was considered serious. No additional Grade 3 or 
greater laboratory adverse events were reported between Week 24 and the data cut-off date. 
Laboratory SAEs were reported in 2 Cohort IV subjects (7.7%) by Week 24. One was the case with 
increased blood bilirubin mentioned above and the other involved lipase increased that led to a 
temporary interruption of study therapy. On Day 11 there was Grade 4 lipase (Grade 2 at baseline) 
originally reported as drug related but due to confounding co-infections with CMV and EBV the 
investigator ultimately determined that the increased lipase was not related to raltegravir. No 
additional laboratory SAEs were reported between Week 24 and the cut-off date. Analyses of all data 
showed that mean values of ALT and AST modestly decreased in Cohorts IV and V, whereas there were 
modest increases in haemoglobin, platelets and absolute neutrophil counts to Week 48. There were no 
specific abnormal laboratory values of clinical relevance observed in Cohorts IV and V. 
In Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III laboratory AEs of any grade (Grades 1–4) were reported by 94.8% of 
Final Dose subjects. There were 10 subjects with laboratory events reported since Week 48 and in 
5/10 these were Grade 3 or greater. There were no new drug related Grade 3 or drug related 
laboratory SAEs and no discontinuations or deaths due to laboratory AEs. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
In Cohorts IV and V two subjects (7.7%) discontinued from the study due to AEs. One was the Cohort 
V subject who discontinued due to a serious Grade 3 allergic rash. The second was the Cohort IV 
subject who died due to gastroenteritis. 
In Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III two (2.1%) subjects in the Final Dose population discontinued due to a 
drug related AE. One was the case who died on Day 597 due to pneumonia and the second was the 
case who discontinued due to Grade 4 agitation. There was a further subject who discontinued due to 
Grade 3 renal failure (not serious and not drug related) that occurred on Day 1443 of study therapy, 
after a report of a Grade 3 septic shock (serious and not related) that occurred on Day 1436 of study 
therapy. There were no other discontinuations due to clinical or laboratory AEs among All Treated 
subjects by the cut-off date. 
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The additional safety data reported in the youngest age groups do not give rise to any new or major 
concerns. In the older children there were no new concerns raised by the longer-term exposure data. 
The tables of subject disposition as shown in the section on efficacy demonstrate that very few 
subjects have discontinued due to AEs.

Updates affect the Product Information for ISENTRESS 400 mg film-coated tablets as well as the 
ISENTRESS 100 mg and 25 chewable tablets. The changes to the product Information are presented as 
new text underlined and deleted text marked as strikethrough.  
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated.  
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, and children, toddlers and 
infants from the age of 2 years4 weeks (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Children and adolescents 
If at least 25 kg, Tthe recommended dosage is 400 mg (one tablet) twice daily. If unable to swallow a 
tablet, consider the chewable tablet.for adolescents (12 to 18 years), and children 6  to less than 
12 years of age, weighing at least 25 kg 
ISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation for children 2 through 11to less than 
12 years of age and weighing at least 112 kg and in granules for oral suspension formulation for 
infants and toddlers from 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg to less than 20 kg. Refer to the 
chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension EU-SmPCs for additional dosing information.  
The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations are not 
bioequivalent, do not substitute neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension 
should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets and the granules 
for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults. 
Paediatric population 
Safety and efficacy of raltegravir in children infants below 2 years4 weeks of age have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
ISENTRESS 400 mg tablets can be administered with or without food. 
It is not recommended to The tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split the 400 mg tablets due to 
anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic profile 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
§ One paediatric patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor 
hyperactivity and abnormal behaviour, this patient also had insomnia. 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Resistance 
Mutations conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand 
transfer inhibitor elvitegravir.  Mutations at amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir 
than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to 
raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir 
resistance mutations, may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir. Preliminary data 
indicate that there is potential for at least some degree of cross-resistance to occur between raltegravir 
and other integrase inhibitors.

Clinical experience 
Paediatric population 
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age2 to 18 Years of Age 
Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and 
adolescents 2 through to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT 
P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of 
ISENTRESS. 
Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age 4 Weeks to less than 2 Years of Age 
Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV 1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 
years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 
5.2).  
In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions 
through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults. 
One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment 
discontinuation. 
Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age2 to 18 Years of Age 
IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children. This study enrolled 126 
treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 through to18 years of age. Patients were stratified 
by age, enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children. Patients received either the 
400 mg tablet formulation (6 through to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation 
(2 through to less than 1211 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimized 
background regimen. 
Minor typo corrections and revisions to the title of Table 4 were introduced. 
Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age 
IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age 
who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child 
transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. 
Raltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in 
combination with an optimized background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds 
of patients.

Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and 
granules for oral suspension havehas higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this 
study, administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in 
AUC, 62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted 
state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir 
pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered 
without regard to food. The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension formulation was not 
studied. 
Table 5 6 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet (6 through 18 years of age), and 
the chewable tablet (2 through 11 years of age), and the granules for oral suspension, by body weight.

1. 
What Isentress is and what it is used for 
When Isentress should be used 
Isentress is used to treat adults, adolescents and, children, toddlers and infants 2 years 4 weeks of age 
and older who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help control your HIV 
infection. 
3. 
How to take Isentress 
• 
• 
It is very important that this medicine is taken exactly as directed. 
As children get older, gain weight or are able to swallow whole tablets, the doctor may want to 
prescribe a different daily dose and/or a different tablet. 
How much to take 
Dose for children of 2 through 11 years of age 
The doctor will work out the right dose of the chewable tablet based on the age and weight of the 
child. This dose must not exceed 300 mg twice a day. The doctor will tell you how many chewable 
tablets the child must take. 
• 
and the 400 mg tablet, without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Do not change the dose, or stop taking this medicine, or switch between the chewable tablets 
ISENTRESS is also available in a 400 mg tablet for use in adults, adolescents and childrenaged 12 
years and older, and in children aged 6 through 11to less than 12 years of age weighing at least 25 
kg and able to swallow a tablet; and as granules for oral suspension for use in infants and toddlers 
from 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg to less than 20 kg. 
Do not switch between the chewable tablet, granules for oral suspension or 400 mg tablet 
• 
without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
As cChildren should keep scheduled doctor’s visits because their Isentress dosage should be 
• 
adjusted as they get older, grow or gain weight. or are able to chew a tablet, Their doctor may also 
want to prescribe a different daily dose and/or a different tablet the 400 mg tablet when they are able 
to swallow a tablet. 
Instructions of the preparation of Isentress granules for oral suspension were introduced.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Raltegravir has been shown to be effective in adults. Subject to identification of suitable dose regimens 
it could be expected that raltegravir would contribute in a similar fashion to regimens used in subjects 
aged < 18 years. The virological responses observed in study 022, including the two youngest age 
Cohorts, are generally in line with data obtained in treatment-experienced adults. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Study P022 was not designed to provide definitive efficacy data. It is not possible to match exactly the 
adult plasma profile using 400 mg poloxamer tablets when dosing children aged < 2 years with GFS. 
To a considerable extent the expectation of efficacy is based on the results of study 071 and the 
evidence that points to the importance of C12h. While these concentrations are lower in the younger 
children the actual data suggest that the majority of them should achieve and maintain values above 
the proposed cut-off provided they adhere to the regimen. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
At present the data suggest a comparable safety profile in children aged < 2 years as has been 
observed in older children, adolescents and adults. There are no new concerns raised. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The numbers of subjects aged < 18 years exposed to raltegravir are very limited and the duration of 
reporting is relatively short for the subjects aged < 2 years. However, the longer-term data from the 
older children do not currently suggest the onset of new AEs emerging with time. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall the data suggest a favourable benefit-risk balance for children aged from 4 weeks up to a cut-
off weight of 20 kg (i.e. maximum GFD dose of 100 mg BID). 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data 
Assessment report  
EMA/558494/2014  
Page 54/57 
 
 
 
 
 
support robust dose recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children 
may be accepted.  
Data from study 022 supports the use of the GFS formulation in children aged from 4 weeks up to a 
cut-off weight of 20 kg (i.e. maximum GFD dose of 100 mg BID). Satisfactory virological and 
immunological response rates were observed in in Study P022.  
In addition, the safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new safety 
findings in the paediatric population compared to that of older children and adults. No specific safety 
concerns in the paediatric population were identified in the data submitted with the present application. 
As a consequence, the CHMP concluded that the benefit /risk balance is favourable for use of Isentress 
GFS in patients aged from 4 weeks and up to a maximum dose of 100 mg BID is considered to be 
favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk/benefit balance of the extension of Marketing Authorisation for ISENTRESS granules for 
oral solution 100 mg in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced paediatric patients from the age of 4 weeks is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the current conditions 
below.  
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change(s) 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a - OpnionAccepted.  C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
II 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Grouping of a line extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form (100 mg granules for 
oral suspension) and a type II variation to extend the indication to toddlers and infants from 4 weeks 
to less than 2 years of age. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated 
and separate SmPC is introduced for the new pharmaceutical form. The Package Leaflet and Labelling 
are updated in accordance. In addition, minor updates are made to SmPC sections 5.1 and 6.1, 
Labelling and the PL. Furthermore, the product information is brought in line with the latest QRD 
version 9.3. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the SmPC, <Annex II>, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet. 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Grouping of a line extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form (100 mg granules for 
oral suspension) and a type II variation to extend the indication to toddlers and infants from 4 weeks 
to less than 2 years of age. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated 
and separate SmPC is introduced for the new pharmaceutical form. The Package Leaflet and Labelling 
are updated in accordance. In addition, minor updates are made to SmPC sections 5.1 and 6.1,

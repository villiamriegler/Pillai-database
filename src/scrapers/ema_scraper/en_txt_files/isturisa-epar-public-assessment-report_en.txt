1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 9 November 2018 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Isturisa, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 April 2017. 
Isturisa was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1345 in the following condition:  
Treatment of Cushing's syndrome. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Isturisa as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment report 
published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Isturisa 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0011/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0011/2016 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance osilodrostat to be considered as a new active substance, as the 
applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
EMA/653461/2019

Union. 
Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on the development for the indication on 24 October 
2013 () and Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 26 April 2018. The Scientific Advice and Protocol Assistance 
pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
Protocol assistance 
• 
The applicant received Protocol assistance from the CHMP on the development of Osilodrostat for the 
treatment of Cushing’s disease from the CHMP on 24 October 2013 and for the treatment of Cushing's 
syndrome on 26 April 2018. The initial advice in 2013 concerned pre-clinical and clinical questions while 
in 2018, the applicant asked questions related to the quality development. 
Clinical development 
•  Clinical questions concerned the acceptability of the pivotal LCI699C2301 study that was a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study following a 24-week, single-arm, open-label dose 
titration and treatment period, to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of LCI699.  
The specific design aspects discussed were patient population, inclusion of patients with a history of 
pituitary irradiation, duration of the withdrawal and the overall study duration, dose titration scheme, 
adequacy of the primary and secondary endpoints, stratification factors, adequacy of the efficacy 
analysis and sample size. A question was also asked about the adequacy of the one pivotal study 
together with supportive data to support a MAA. 
In addition, questions were asked about the clinical pharmacology program and cardiac safety 
• 
• 
monitoring in the phase II and pivotal studies. 
Preclinical development 
• 
Preclinical question concerned the adequacy of nonclinical safety program to support registration of 
LCI699 in Cushing’s disease in adult patients.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indication for Isturisa as requested by the applicant was: 
“Isturisa is indicated for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (CS) denotes a group of rare diseases with an estimated overall prevalence of 
0.7 to 2.4 per million population per year. The disease affects most commonly adults aged 20 to 50 and has a 
marked female preponderance. The chronic hypercortisolaemic state is associated with multiple comorbidities 
that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Compared to patients with controlled disease, 
patients with incompletely controlled disease are seriously ill and have at least a fivefold increased mortality, 
mainly due to metabolic and cardiovascular complications. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CS is divided into adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent CS and ACTH-independent CS. 
ACTH-dependent CS accounts for about 80% of all cases and is caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary 
corticotroph adenoma (Cushing’s disease (CD)) or by ectopic ACTH secretion by a non-pituitary tumour. The 
ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) causes approximately 10% of all cases of CS. EAS is predominantly caused by 
neuroendocrine tumours. ACTH-independent CS accounts for 20% of all causes of CS and is most frequently 
caused by a unilateral cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma and less frequently by bilateral macro- or 
micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and a cortisol-producing adrenal carcinoma. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Clinical manifestations of chronic hypercortisolism include metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, visceral 
obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and hypercoagulable state. Other clinical signs and 
symptoms of CS include: supraclavicular and dorsal fat pads; proximal muscle weakness; osteoporosis with 
increased risk of fractures; skin changes (wide purple striae, hirsutism, acne); impaired immune function with 
increased risk of infection; neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, mood changes, and cognitive impairment), 
hypogonadism, and menstrual disorders in women.  
The diagnosis of CS is challenging, and patients often remain undiagnosed for many years before receiving 
appropriate diagnosis and therapy. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 9/134 
  
  
  
 
2.1.5.  Management 
Surgical resection of underlying tumour 
The first-line treatment of nearly all forms of CS is surgical resection of the underlying tumour (exceptions 
include CS due to metastatic adrenal carcinoma or EAS with an unknown source of ACTH secretion or EAS 
associated with a metastatic malignant tumour). In a number of patients, medical intervention is initiated to 
bridge the time until surgery is scheduled or to improve their clinical conditions before surgery. Post-surgical 
remission rates of 60 to 90% have been reported in CD and up to 80% in EAS (Newell-Price et al 2006, Kelly 
2007, Wagner-Bartak et al 2017). However, long-term follow-up of CD patients in remission shows a recurrence 
rate of up to 60% at 10 years (Newell-Price et al 2006). 
Radiotherapy 
Radiotherapy is a possible alternative for CD patients in whom surgery is not indicated or has not been 
successful; however, the treatment is associated with significant side effects and reoccurrence of disease (Kelly 
2007, Biller et al 2008, Pivonello et al 2015). Radiotherapy may take many years to be effective and medical 
therapy is required until radiotherapy becomes effective. 
Bilateral adrenalectomy 
Bilateral adrenalectomy is associated with life-threatening primary adrenal insufficiency, life-long replacement 
therapy with mineral- and glucocorticoid therapy, possible hypercortisolism due to excess ACTH stimulation of 
residual adrenal tissue, and the development of an aggressive corticotroph tumor, Nelson syndrome (Azad et al 
2015). 
Medical therapy  
To date, there is no single, established standard of care medical therapy for endogenous CS worldwide. Medical 
therapy is indicated in patients with hypercortisolism of adrenal origin (i.e., patients with adrenal hyperplasia, 
adenomas, and carcinomas) who are not surgical candidates or for whom surgery is not available or which is 
unlikely to cure the CS/hypercortisolism) and for patients not cured after surgery or have recurred after initial 
control by surgery. The goal is clinical normalization using cortisol levels as a proxy endpoint (except for 
mifepristone). This can be achieved either with a “block and replace” strategy in which circulating cortisol is 
reduced to minimally detectable levels and glucocorticoid replacement is added (avoiding supraphysiological 
doses) or with a “normalization” strategy aimed to achieve eucortisolism. If there is evidence of significant 
cyclicity, block and replace may be preferable, but it carries additional risk if higher doses and multiple 
medications are needed. Currently available medical therapies for CS are classified based on the site of drug 
action and include pituitary-directed drugs, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor 
antagonists (Tritos and Biller 2018). 
Pituitary-directed drugs 
Pasireotide (Signifor, Novartis) approved via centralized procedure for the “treatment of adult patients with 
Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed.” since Apr-2012. In the 
pivotal study of the intramuscular formulation, 41% of patients were controlled at the primary endpoint 
(Lacroix 2018). Advantages include the once monthly frequency of administration (for the recently approved 
intramuscular formulation) and the causal nature of therapy (reduction of excess pituitary ACTH secretion). 
Disadvantages include a risk of hyperglycemia resulting from the inhibition of insulin secretion. Due to its mode 
of action, pasireotide cannot be used in patients with ACTH-independent causes of Cushing’s syndrome. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 10/134 
  
  
  
 
 
Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors 
Steroidogenesis inhibitors are recommended under the following conditions: 
•  As second-line treatment after transsphenoidal surgery in patients with CD, either with or without 
RT/radiosurgery; 
•  As primary treatment of EAS in patients with occult or metastatic EAS together with targeted therapies 
to treat the underlying tumor; 
•  As adjunctive treatment to reduce cortisol levels in adrenocortical carcinoma. 
Ketoconazole (Ketoconazole HRA, HRA Pharma) is approved via centralized procedure for “the treatment of 
endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults and adolescents above the age of 12 years” since Nov-2014, after 
its removal from the market for the treatment of fungal infections due to the high risk of hepatotoxicity. A 
control rate of 49% at last available assessment has been reported in a retrospective patient record review 
(Castinetti 2014; no prospective trial data are currently available). Ketoconazole can be used in all types of 
Cushing’s syndrome however it has the potential for severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity, its high 
drug-drug-interaction potential (because of its relatively unspecific inhibitory effects, a broad range of 
enzymes both within the steroidogenesis pathway and elsewhere are inhibited, resulting e.g. in near complete 
testosterone suppression), and the limited titration range (starting dose is one 200mg tablet tid; maximum 
dose is two 200mg tablets tid). Metyrapone (Metopirone, HRA Pharma) inhibits adrenocorticosteroid 
synthesis and is approved via national or mutual recognition procedure in 15 member states for “the 
management of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome” (first EU approval UK 1973). The response to 
metyrapone is rapid, and the desired cortisol levels can be achieved after two weeks of treatment (Verhelst et 
al 1991). Control rates ranging from 64% to 94% have been reported with long-term use (>6 months) in a 
retrospective study (Daniel et al 2015), however the choice of biochemical monitoring tests and frequency of 
monitoring varied. Metyrapone has a lower impact on testosterone levels compared to ketoconazole (Fleseriu 
et al 2016). Gastrointestinal side effects are common but may be reduced by taking the capsules with milk or 
after a meal. The product is large (8x19 mm) and due to the short half-life three to four times daily 
administration is required.  
Mitotane (Lysodren, HRA Pharma) is approved via centralized procedure for the “symptomatic treatment of 
advanced (unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC)” since Apr-2004. It has a 
strong adrenolytic effect in the symptomatic treatment of advanced adrenal corticocarcinoma but a very slow 
onset of action and accumulation in storage sites in fat (reported terminal plasma half-lives range from 18 to 
159 days) and the need for serum level monitoring. Mitotane has serious neurological, gastrointestinal and 
hepatic side effects and causes hypercholesterolemia, which significantly limits its benefit risk in 
non-malignant Cushing’s syndromes. 
Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist that has been used off-label in the treatment of Cushing’s disease, based 
on an observed reduction in UFC levels in patients who have tumours with high expression of D2 receptors (De 
Bruin 2008). 
Etomidate is a sedative which is sometimes used as a parenteral (intravenous) hypocortisolaemic agent 
before or during adrenalectomy in patients with severe life-threatening hypercortisolaemia where rapid control 
of cortisol levels is required and oral therapy is problematic. However, a highly co-ordinated multidisciplinary 
approach is necessary for the management of unwell hypercortisolaemic patients, as these patients have 
complex problems beyond the daily ward scope of medical and nursing staff. The clinical setting of an intensive 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 11/134 
  
  
  
 
care or high dependency unit is therefore recommended for close patient and biochemical testing monitoring, 
particularly for serum cortisol and potassium levels and the documentation of the level of sedation. 
Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists 
Use of these class of products with their action on the glucocorticoid receptor has been described  in patients 
with Cushing’s syndrome, but  are not authorised for this use in the EU and have limited or no availability in the 
EU.  
Following the unmet medical need in CS, attempts have been made to combine different medical treatments in 
order to improve the biochemical control rate and, potentially, improving the safety profile by using lower doses. 
The number of such studies is quite limited and they included a low number of patients. 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Osilodrostat (also known as LCI699) is a potent inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), the enzyme that 
catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland. Due to the mechanism of action (i.e., 
inhibition of cortisol synthesis), osilodrostat is expected to be effective in all types of endogenous Cushing’s 
Syndrome (CS). The product has been developed as a film-coated tablet in three strengths (1 mg, 5 mg and 10 
mg) that allows for convenient, finely graded dose titration. 
Aspects on development 
This application is based on the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) from the Phase III pivotal 
Study C2301 and two supportive Phase II studies (Studies C2201 (Part I and II) and CLCI699C1201 (referred to 
as Study C1201)). These studies all included subjects with Cushing’s syndrome and are assessed in the clinical 
sections of this report. 
Osilodrostat was initially investigated for the treatment of hypertension, and primary hyperaldosteronism in four 
Phase II studies (Study CLCI699A2201, Study CLCI699A2206, Study CLCI699A2215, Study CLCI699A2216]. 
Further development in these indications was discontinued in 2010 because of the suppression of 
ACTH-stimulated cortisol response observed in these studies. The four studies included over 500 patients 
treated with osilodrostat at low doses (0.25 to 2 mg/day) for durations of 4 to 8 weeks. Some data on 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety data are provided from some of these studies. 
The clinical development program for osilodrostat was planned based on its mechanisms of action and on 
applicable scientific guidelines on the diagnosis of the disease (Arnaldi et al 2003, Pivonello et al 2008), 
regulatory guidelines (in particular, the FDA 2012 Guidance on Enrichment Strategies and the ICH 2000 E10 on 
Choice of Control Groups). There are no relevant CHMP guidance in the indication. 
The application concerns an orphan condition, thus the number of subjects included in the clinical development 
program is limited, with 137 subjects included in the pivotal study. Only 7 subjects above the aged 65 to 75 
years were included in the pivotal study. 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the notion that other treatment alternatives 
are available and therefore patients are today not lacking treatment options and thus there is not an absolute 
unmet need.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of osilodrostat phosphate is (5R)-5-(4-Cyano-2-fluorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H 
pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazolium dihydrogen phosphate corresponding to the molecular formula C13H11FN3(H2PO4). It 
has a molar mass of 325.24 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of osilodrostat phosphate was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, UV, 
MS, IR and NMR. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRPD, X-ray 
crystallography, DSC and TGA. 
The active substance is a white to practically white powder with high solubility in water and aqueous buffers. It 
is less soluble in organic solvents. The pH value of 1 % solution in water is 4.45, pKa = 6.9.The active substance 
is not hygroscopic. Osilodrostat phosphate consists of agglomerates/aggregates with a consistent primary 
particle size. 
Osilodrostat exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The manufacturing process 
consistently produces a single isomer (R-enantiomer). Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC.  
Polymorphism has been observed for osilodrostat. Osilodrostat phosphate is crystalline, anhydrous and 
non-hygroscopic. A single polymorphic form is obtained by the manufacturing process.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Osilodrostat is synthesised by a convergent synthesis in three main stages from well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications.  
A number of steps are true chemical transformations wherein covalent bonds are formed and/or broken. The 
remaining steps include the formation and neutralisation of salts, in order to achieve purifications by chiral 
resolution, the preparation of an intermediate for the next reaction step and eventually the introduction of the 
phosphate counter ion into the active substance.  
The selection of the GMP starting materials is justified by the Applicant by the consideration of the general 
principles of the ICH Q11 guideline. The syntheses of the starting materials are presented, along with the names 
and addresses of their manufacturers and corresponding specifications and Certificates of Analysis. Taking into 
account the information provided, the general principles of ICH Q11, as well as the conclusions of a previously 
obtained scientific advice, the proposed starting materials were deemed to be acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. A detailed discussion on the origin and characterisation of potential and 
actual impurities is presented for the starting materials and every intermediate along the manufacturing 
process. The structures and molecular formulas of all impurities are given, along with a toxicological 
assessment, observations on the origin and fate of each impurity, level detected at an appropriate stage and the 
corresponding control strategy. 
Potential genotoxicity was assessed applying computational (Q)SAR methodologies following the 
recommendations of the ICH M7 guideline. The in silico analyses were performed using expert rule based (Derek 
Nexus, Lhasa Ltd) and statistical-based (Case Ultra, MCASE, Inc. and Sarah Nexus, Lhasa Ltd) systems. 
Impurities showing a structural alert for mutagenicity using the (Q)SAR methodologies were usually tested in a 
bacterial reverse mutation assay (AMES test). In case no AMES was performed, the alerting impurity was 
considered to be mutagenic. Spiking studies, carry-over studies and assessments of the purge safety factors 
have been carried out for potentially mutagenic impurities in order to justify their control strategy. Control by 
the ICH M7 control Option 4 is proposed to control such impurities occurring at earlier stages of the 
manufacturing process. 
Potentially genotoxic impurities are controlled in appropriate intermediates of the manufacturing process. The 
final levels in the active substance have been established to be <30 % of the TTC limit in three validation 
batches. This control is acceptable according to Option 3 of ICH M7. The later-stage potential genotoxic 
impurities are routinely tested in the final active substance. 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised related to the potential formation of N-nitrosamine 
impurities in the synthesis. In response, the applicant provided analytical data to demonstrate that levels of 
possible nitrosamine impurities are controlled to an acceptable level and introduced routine testing for the 
specified nitrosamine impurities in active substance specification using a combined direct injection GC MS/MS 
method.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. The chemistry of the synthesis of Osilodrostat phosphate has remained basically 
unchanged since early pre-clinical development of the compound, with only minor process variations as a result 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 14/134 
  
  
  
 
of optimization of process parameters. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the 
development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in in polyethylene bags, which are in turn placed into triple laminated foil bags 
which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, particle size (air-jet sieving), identity (HPLC, 
IR (ATR), XRPD), related substances / impurities (HPLC, GC MS/MS), enantiomer (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC), water (KF),  assay (HPLC, potentiometric titration) and microbial quality (Ph Eur). 
The acceptance criteria for specified impurities have been justified based on general ICH thresholds where 
applicable and qualified in non-clinical and clinical studies. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis data (commercial scale and development batches) of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH and 30°C / 75% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release.  The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The active substance is not 
photosensitive.  
Results of forced degradation studies at stress conditions were also provided. Mass balance of >98% was 
achieved under all stress conditions, confirming the method is suitable and stability indicating. The active 
substance was found to be stable in solid state, but sensitive to degradation under acidic, alkaline and oxidative 
(H2O2) stress conditions and hydrolytic stress conditions.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 1 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg of osilodrostat as 
active substance. The product is available in Alu/Alu blisters.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 15/134 
  
  
  
 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The finished product has been developed by a combination of a traditional development approach, based on 
common knowledge and prior experience, and a more systematic enhanced approach involving quality by 
design elements. However, no formal design space or regulatory flexibility is claimed.   
Osilodrostat is a BCS class I compound, characterized by its high solubility, high permeability and extensive 
absorption. Design of Experiments (DoE) study on the formulation composition was performed to investigate the 
influence of excipients on the tablet properties. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of 
the finished product and their manufacturing process.  
The formulation development is described in detail. The finished product was initially formulated as 0.25 mg, 0.5 
mg, 1 mg, 5 mg and 50 mg hard-gelatin capsules to supply early Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. In 2014 the 
capsules were replaced by 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg immediate release film-coated tablets which were used 
in late Phase 1, Phase 2 and the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for the targeted indication. Only 1 mg, 5 mg and 
10 mg film-coated tablets will be marketed. Comparative dissolution profiles between hard-gelatin capsules and 
commercial tablets support the BCS-based biowaiver. All (historic) changes made to the formulation during 
development are described in detail in the dossier. 
Osilodrostat 1 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets are manufactured by processes commonly used in the 
production of oral solid dosage forms. The selection and development of the manufacturing methods is justified 
and documented in detail.  
The dissolution method development is described. Dissolution Apparatus I (Basket) was selected during method 
development. Overall there is no significant impact of the dissolution medium pH on the dissolution rate as 
expected with this compound based on its high solubility, and rapid dissolution is observed across the 
physiological pH range. The phosphate buffer of pH 6.8 has been selected for the routine test as during 
formulation and method development in some experiments a slightly slower dissolution and thus higher 
discriminatory power was observed in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer compared to other media. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The  primary  packaging  is  aluminium-aluminium  blisters.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for 1 mg film-coated tablets consists of twelve main steps including several 
(pre)-blending and screening steps, compression, film-coating and packaging. The process for 1 mg tablets is 
considered a non-standard manufacturing process due to the low active substance content (<2% of the 
composition).  
The manufacturing process for 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets consists of fourteen main steps including 
blending and screening steps, roller compaction, final blending, compression, film-coating and packaging. The 
process for 5 mg and 10 mg tablets is considered a standard manufacturing process.  
Critical steps have been identified in both manufacturing processes.  The control strategies for these critical 
steps (proven acceptable ranges, IPCs) are based on the process development studies performed. No critical 
intermediates are defined in the manufacturing processes.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 16/134 
  
  
  
 
The robustness of the manufacturing processes have been assessed at production scale using 3 consecutive 
batches of each strength. The 1 mg tablet is a low-dose formulation and full-scale results have been provided. 
All nine batches consistently meet the quality control specifications. Additional validation studies with three 
consecutive batches of each strength manufactured at the target settings for commercial production will be 
performed. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance, 
mean mass, identity (UV, HPLC), water, dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), 
degradation products (HPLC), microbiological purity (Ph Eur). 
The finished product is released on the market through traditional final product release testing. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on three batches using 
a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis results are provided for representative clinical, registration stability and confirmatory production 
scale batches of 1 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg Film-coated tablets (three batches of each strength for clinical, 
registration and production scale) confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 30 months under long 
term conditions (25°C / 60% RH and 30°C/75%RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC 
/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Isturisa are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The batches were tested for appearance (shape, colour, imprint, thickness, diameter), assay and degradation 
products, dissolution, water content, microbial enumeration testing. Three additional parameters are monitored 
which are not included in the specifications: enantiomer by HPLC, disintegration time and crushing strength. No 
significant trends or changes are observed for any of the parameters tested. 
Additional stress studies have been performed such as a freeze/thaw cycle study with one registration batch per 
strength, and an open dish study with two registration batches per dosage strength. The stability samples were 
stored for four complete freeze/thaw cycles (i.e. -20°C/ambient RH for 6 days, followed by 1 day at 
25°C/60%RH) and analysed after 28 days. No significant change is observed in chemical and physical stability 
after 28 days of storage. The results for open dish study demonstrate that the finished product is stable for up 
to 3 months after removal from the original Alu-Alu blisters at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75%RH however no 
in-use shelf-life is claimed in the SmPC.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 17/134 
  
  
  
 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances  and  Products.  All  dosage  strengths  show  acceptable  chemical  and  physical  stability  in  the 
photostability study. The results obtained for the unpacked samples exposed to light met the specifications for 
all the quality parameters tested. The results were comparable to the ones determined on dark control samples 
(samples protected from light). However, a slight decrease in disintegration time and crushing strength was 
observed in the unpacked samples when compared to the control samples for all the dosage strengths. This did 
not have any impact on the samples since the appearance, assay, degradation products, water content and 
dissolution met the analytical specifications.  
Based on available stability data from registration stability and supportive stability, the proposed shelf-life of 36 
months and “do not store above 25°C, store in the original container in order to protect from moisture” as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
 Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamics 
One of the submitted in vitro studies (study RD2007-51927) has investigated the pharmacodynamics of the 
indication applied for, i.e. inhibition of CYP11B1. The results show that osilodrostat inhibit CYP11B1 activity in 
V79-4 cell homogenates from CYP11B1 transfected cells. The Applicant has constructed a cell line stable 
transfected with human CYP11B1, and with adrenodoxin and adronodoxin reductase (cell line #618 as described 
in LaSala et al) to maximize the enzyme activity. The IC50 value for osilodrostat of 2.5 nM (RD-2007-51927) 
and 3.2 nM (RD-2014-00299) is several hundred times lower than clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax at 
therapeutic doses 233 ng/mL = 1 µM). IC50 for recombinant rat CYP11B1 is 410 nM showing that osilodrostat 
is considerably more potent at the human CYP11B1 compared with the rat (Menard et al 2014).  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 18/134 
  
  
  
 
In ACTH stimulated monkeys no inhibition of cortisol concentrations was noted, as opposite to what have been 
found in humans. The Applicant argued that this discrepancy could be due to different osilodrostat 
pre-treatment schedules (daily for 6 and 13 days in humans versus one single administration in monkeys) 
and/or the time prolonged to the ACTH stimulation (2 h versus 3 hours). Using a different experimental design 
including higher doses (up to 10000 ug/kg), Weldon et al showed that osilodrostat inhibited ACTH stimulated 
cortisol synthesis in monkeys with an EC50 of 1500 nM being approximately 300-fold higher than EC50 for 
aldosterone synthesis.   
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Osilodrostat was first developed as a CYP11B2 inhibitor and therefore several studies have been conducted to 
test the ability to inhibit aldosterone synthesis. In this application this is considered a secondary PD effect rather 
than a primary PD effect. The IC50 value for aldosterone inhibition (CYP11B2 activity) is in the same range (1.8 
nM) as for cortisol inhibition (CYP11B1 activity) in vitro (3.2 nM). Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 
decreases in rats in a dose dependent manner with ED50 of 0.6 mg/kg (exposure=127 nM) and 1.1 mg/kg for 
inhibiting Ang-II stimulated and ACTH stimulated responses, respectively. The estimated ED50 for ACTH 
stimulated aldosterone PAC in monkeys was 13 ug/kg. Even though these doses are clinically relevant this is in 
line with the fact that osilodrostat first was developed as a CYP11B2 inhibitor with a poor PD effect in humans.  
Moreover, the inhibitory effect on aromatase was investigated in vitro (RD-2007-51924). An IC50 of 1.7 uM was 
found whereas when the “certified LCI699-AZA” osilodrostat was used (RD-2014-365) the IC50 value was >16 
uM. The later IC50 concentration is above the clinically relevant Cmax of approximately 1 µM.  The reason for 
discrepancy between RD-2007-51924 and RD-2014-365 result is that in the “certified LCI699-AZA” osilodrostat 
drug formulation the (+) enantiomer LCI698 is present at lower levels (<0.05% compared to approximately 3 
%). LCI698 was shown to be a potent aromatase inhibitor (IC50=9 nM). PK/TK studies indicate that no chiral 
conversion from osilodrostat to LCI698 occurs in rat and dogs, and also no chiral conversion has been observed 
in humans. So conclusively LCI698 induced aromatase inhibition may not be of clinical relevance and the 
concern raised in the SA 2013 (EMEA/H/SA/2614/1/2013/III) has been addressed. Nevertheless, it may be 
possible that local conversions can take place, resulting in aromatase inhibition in some organs. 
Pharmacodynamics of Metabolites 
In addition to osilodrostat (LCI699), three metabolites have been studied in vitro (LXB168/M34.5, 
LFD085/M24.9 and LWP114/M16.5) to assess their inhibitory effect on cortisone synthase, aldosterone synthase 
and aromatase. One of the metabolites, LFD085 (M24.9) inhibits all three CYP enzymes investigated. The IC50 
values for cortisone and aldosterone activity were higher than osilodrostat whereas for aromatase inhibition the 
metabolite is more potent than osilodrostat itself.  Since <10 % of the M24.9 metabolite is formed in humans, 
it most likely will not exert any inhibition of clinical importance. However, the metabolites have only been 
measured after a single dose of osilodrostat and the exposure after repeated dosing is not known (see clinical 
pharmacokinetic section for more discussion). An in vitro binding study including a panel of 73 G-coupled 
receptors, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes did not identify off-target activity for 
M34.5 and M24.9 when tested at concentrations up to 30 µM.   
Safety pharmacology 
The screening for off-targets shows that osilodrostat has low affinity for several receptors with safety concerns 
regarding particularly CNS, and cardiovascular effects. The only receptor that osilodrostat show a >50 % affinity 
to, is H1 histamin receptor. The relevance of this binding is not known, and it could not be discerned if 
osilodrostat binding lead to agonistic or antagonistic effects.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 19/134 
  
  
  
 
In the telemetry studies conducted in dogs no effects on QT interval were observed, whereas in one rabbit study 
(in vitro) and in four studies conducted in monkeys, QT prolongation was found. In the isolated rabbit hearts also 
Tp-e prolongation and increase contractile forces were noted at 0.4 and 43 µM, respectively. According to the 
(0616814) study, osilodrostat inhibits hERG channel activity in stably transfected HEK293 cells with IC50 = 54 
µM (which is approximately 50 times higher than Cmax concentrations in patients). The telemetry single dose 
studies in monkeys all demonstrated a clear signal for QT prolongation (13-29 % increase) at doses ≥30 mg/kg. 
When osilodrostat was administered for 2 weeks (study 1270612), 10 mg/kg/day resulted in QTs prolongation 
(11 % increases). QTc interval prolongation has also been observed in patients (Study C2301 – see clinical 
section). The proposed SmPC contains information and warnings concerning this risk in section 4.4, 4.8, and 
4.9. From a non-clinical point of view, no further action is considered necessary. 
No effects on CNS (observational study) or respiratory function (tidal volume, respiration rate, minute volume) 
were noted after single oral gavage dose of osilodrostat in the rat. In the repeat dose toxicity studies CNS effects 
(aggression, hypersensitive to touch and increased motor activity) were observed in the mouse, rat and dog 
(see toxicology section). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
According to the Applicant the LC-MS/MS bioanalysis used in the GLP toxicity studies of osilodrostat have been 
validated. According to Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 
Corr. 2) aspects of method validation not performed according to GLP should be clearly identified and their 
potential impact on the validation status of the method indicated. Accordingly, the applicant presented an 
overview of validation activities for all bioassays employed and all methods are of high-quality standards.  
Absorption 
According to the Applicant a rapid absorption with a high bioavailability (>100 %) was seen in the rat after 
administration of 14C-osilodrostat (study 0600206A), which indicates a minimal first-pass activity on 
osilodrostat. However, in study RD2006-50315 the bioavailability of osilodrostat in rats was dose dependent and 
between 13 – 63 %, suggesting that osilodrostat indeed is subject to first-passage metabolism. In rat and dog, 
no accumulation of osilodrostat in the plasma was observed. Plasma half-lives in rat and dogs were short (1-2 
h) and similar to what was reported in humans (T1/2 of 4 h). Low plasma protein binding was seen in all species 
investigated (27-37 %). None of the absorption studies were performed in female rats and hence gender 
comparison in PK could not be assessed, but no gender differences were noted in the TK analysis.  
Distribution 
Oral intake of osilodrostat was widely and rapidly distributed to tissues. Cmax was higher in all tissues 
investigated than blood when radioactivity was studied. The highest tissue to blood ratios were found in the 
uveal tract, skin (pigmented), eye, glandular stomach, small intestine, liver and adrenal cortex. Affinity to 
melanin was confirmed since 11-fold higher radioactivity in skin was noted in pigmented rats than in albino rats. 
Retention to melanin appears to be reversible.  
No placental transfer studies have been performed.  
Metabolism and excretion 
Several metabolites are formed in vitro and in vivo. The metabolic pathways include particularly oxidative 
metabolism and glucuronidation. The main metabolite found in plasma after single dose administration of 
14C-osilodrostat in human and rat is M34.5 (about 60 % of total radioactivity in both rats and humans). Two 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 20/134 
  
  
  
 
other metabolites M16.5 and M24.9 are formed just below 10 % after a single oral dose administration in rats 
and humans. M16.5 is of no toxicological concern, as per the ICH M3(R2) Q&A document, since M16.5 is a 
non-acyl glucuronide metabolite. 
Notably, since no pharmacokinetic data of the metabolites were provided after repeated osilodrostat dosing the 
exposure margins between human and rats could not be determined. See2.3.5 for more discussion on estimated 
M34.5 exposure in toxicity studies.  
In addition to M34.5, M16.5 and M24.9, all other metabolites are all formed to a much lesser extent. Thus, it is 
believed than none of them will have any clinical significance.  
Urinary excretion of the metabolites is the main elimination pathway of osilodrostat in all species investigated. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of osilodrostat has been evaluated in agreement with recommendations in ICH M3. The 
performed studies included single-dose toxicity in mice, repeat-dose toxicity studies for up to 13 weeks in mice, 
26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, embryo-foetal development toxicity in 
rats and rabbits, in vitro phototoxicity and investigative gene expression/profiling studies of rat liver. In 
addition, toxicological qualification of potential impurities has been addressed. 
The observed osilodrostat related toxicity in the tested animals may be of uncertain clinical relevance for 
humans since the main target for osilodrostat in animals (rats and monkeys) is aldosterone synthase and 
secondarily (and to a much lesser content) 11β-hydroxylase which is the opposite in humans. Since no inhibition 
on PCC (plasma corticosterone concentration) in rats and monkeys not infused with ACTH is seen, toxicity 
associated with cortisol inhibition cannot be studied. However, the adverse effects of hypocortisolism are 
clinically well known (e.g. nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, dizziness). Consequently, warnings in 
SmPC 4.4 and 4.9 states that patients should be alerted to these hypocortisolism related events and are advised 
to carry a patient card with package leaflet indicating that they may be at risk of hypocortisolism and that 
appropriate actions should be taken if emergency care is needed. These species differences are therefore not 
critical for the overall safety assessment. 
The rat was found to produce the metabolite M34.5 which was identified as a major circulating metabolite in 
human (even if not pharmacologically active). No TK assessments of M34.5 have been performed in any of the 
pivotal safety studies (including carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies) conducted in the rat. Instead 
the applicant assumed that sufficient exposure was achieved by comparing the predicted exposure levels in 
human volunteers administered a single 50 mg of osilodrostat with exposure data in rat and mouse of the ADME 
(non-GLP) studies scaled to doses used in toxicity studies. See 3.2.5 for more discussion on estimated M34.5 
exposure in toxicity studies. 
Single-dose toxicity 
An oral single-dose tolerability study was performed in mice. Osilodrostat was well tolerated up to 125 mg/kg. 
At 150 mg/kg, two animals died within 30 min post-dose and one animal 4-hours post-dose with clinical signs of 
quivering, abnormal gait and abnormal stance preceding death. The remaining animals appeared normal 
throughout the study with no significant bodyweight changes or pathology findings. The lethal dose for 
osilodrostat was set to 150 mg/kg.  
Repeated-dose toxicity 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 21/134 
  
  
  
 
In repeated-dose toxicity studies osilodrostat was tested in mice for up to 13 weeks at 10 to 200 mg/kg/day, in 
rats for up to 26 weeks at 0.2 to 50 mg/kg/day and in dogs for up to 39 weeks at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day. The major 
toxic effects of osilodrostat were found in adrenal glands and of CNS-related nature in mice, rats and dogs and 
in female reproductive organs and liver in mice and rats.  
The effects of CNS origin observed were mainly aggression, hypersensitivity to touch and increased motor 
activity. These effects appeared more frequent and severe in mice and dogs and were observed at doses of ≥10 
mg/kg in mice and at ≥30 mg/kg in dogs. The severity of these effects was dose dependent. The Cmax drug 
exposure with regards to the CNS finding at the NOAEL in the dog (1 mg/kg/day) is less than 2-fold the free 
Cmax exposure in humans at the efficacious dose of 30 mg twice daily. Consequently, the exposure margin 
should be stated in SmPC 5.3 (see SmPC comment) 
In a 13-week mice study, animals were dosed up to 200 mg/kg, i.e. above the lethal dose as concluded in the 
single toxicity study, with following death of 3 males and 3 females and termination of the remaining animals of 
this dose group due to severe clinical signs of CNS origin such as hypersensitivity to touch, increased locomotor 
after the initial dose. The choice of doses was based on a previous 2-weeks non-GLP repeated-dose toxicity 
study in mice where the animals were dosed up to 200 mg/mg without any test article related mortality or 
moribundity  
Osilodrostat-related effects on the adrenal gland were reported in mice, rats and dogs. In mice, findings were 
mostly organ weight changes but did show hypertrophy in the zona fasciculata in the adrenal cortex at 100 
mg/kg/day in a single study (non-GLP 2-weeks repeated dose study). In rats, additional vacuolation in the same 
adrenal layer and in the zona glomerulosa were observed at doses of ≥50 mg/kg/day with reversibility in the 
13-weeks study and in a 2-weeks study, respectively. In dogs, morphological changes, mainly hypertrophy and 
vacuolation, were mainly observed in zona glomerulosa at ≥1 mg/kg/day in the 39-weeks study. Atrophy 
recovered post-treatment but vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland persisted. No evidence 
of adrenal dysfunction was noted in the repeat-dose toxicity studies following oral administration of osilodrostat.   
Osilodrostat-related effects of female reproductive organs were observed in both mice and rats but not in dogs. 
Effects in mice were limited to organ weight changes of ovaries and uterus but in addition to this, follicular 
degeneration in ovaries and atrophy in uterus at ≥5 mg/kg/day, and mucification of vagina at 50 mg/kg/day 
were observed in the 13-weeks rat study. Except for uterine weights, all these effects showed reversibility after 
the recovery period. Osilodrostat-related effects on male reproductive organs consisted of reduced prostate 
weight observed in rats after 26 weeks of treatment that persisted after the recovery period.  
Hepatic changes such as hepatocellular hypertrophy and cytosolic vacuolation were seen in rats at doses ≥ 0.5 
mg/kg for 13 weeks and in mice at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg for 13 weeks. Minimal (~ 2-fold) elevations of liver 
enzymes were noted in mice and dogs. In rats, hepatocellular hypertrophy was reversed but vacuolation 
persisted after 8-weeks of recovery period. Increased cytoplasmic glycogen or plasma glucose and mitosis in the 
liver were observed in mice after 2 doses of 200 mg/kg and in rats after continuous intravenous infusion for 
2-weeks at 50 mg/kg/day. Hypertrophy appears consistent with the adaptive physiological response noted with 
the induction of microsomal enzymes. 
Total or partial reversibility of toxicological changes was observed in all studies with recovery with the exception 
of rats dosed at 50 mg/kg in a 4 week and a 13-week study were liver changes (vacuolation) persisted. 
Toxicokinetics 
The NOAELs observed in the 26- and 39-week repeated-dose toxicity studies in the rat and the dog were 2.0 and 
10 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on the frequency and severity of findings in the liver and female reproductive

organs (rat) and in the adrenal gland (rat and dog). The margins to clinical exposure are approximately 4 and 
14-16 based on Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively.  
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of osilodrostat has been studied with respect to gene mutations in bacteria and chromosomal 
aberrations in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, test of primary DNA damage in vivo has been conducted. 
Osilodrostat did not induce mutations when adequately tested in five histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella 
typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA102) at concentrations up to 5000 μg/plate in the absence 
and in the presence of a rat liver metabolic activation system (S9). Osilodrostat induced structural chromosome 
aberrations when adequately tested in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes in both the absence and 
presence of a rat liver metabolic activation system (S9). Osilodrostat did not show any evidence of chromosomal 
aberrations in vivo in the rat bone marrow micronucleus test when adequately tested up to a single oral dose of 
300 mg/kg. Osilodrostat did not induce any DNA damage when adequately tested in the Comet assay in 
hepatocytes or leukocytes of rats dosed twice orally up to 150 mg/kg. When considering the negative outcome 
of two in vivo studies the weight of evidence suggests that osilodrostat does not constitute a genotoxic risk 
following oral use in humans. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in mice and rats with dosing at 1, 3 and 30 mg/kg/day 
for up to 103/104 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively. The survival in mice was low in all dose groups; being 
lowest in the high-dose males (24%), and in control females (29%). Dosing started in 70 mice / sex and dose 
group, and there were therefore still a reasonable number of animals for assessment at final sacrifice. The 
survival in rats was higher ranging from 68% in control males to 86% in the low dose females. 
Osilodrostat related neoplastic changes (adenoma and/or carcinoma) were observed in liver in male mice and 
rats at 10 mg/kg and in female rats at 30 mg/kg, and in thyroid gland in male rats at 10 mg/kg (see table).

Non-neoplastic changes were observed in liver (hypertrophy), thyroid gland (follicular hyperplasia and 
hypertrophy) in mice and rats and in pituitary (hyperplasia) in male mice, changes that was also observed in the 
repeated dose toxicity studies. 
The applicant suggests that the neoplastic changes in the liver and thyroid (adenoma/carcinoma) of both mice 
and rats are related to constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation in liver causing increased elimination 
of thyroid hormones that subsequently lead to increased secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and 
increased follicular cell proliferation, a phenomena considered to be rodent-specific and of no human relevance. 
The hypertrophy observed in liver of mice and rat indicates a response to induction of xenobiotic enzymes. The 
expression gene analysis data from rat livers show that osilodrostat induces metabolic enzymes, including 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 23/134 
  
  
  
 
 
CYB2B1/CYP2B2 and UDP- glucuronosyltransferase (UDP- GT) known to be targets of CAR activators, and that 
the gene expression profile is similar to that of phenobarbital known to produce liver (and thyroid) tumours in 
rodents but not in humans. The proposed secondary effect due to the hepatic enzyme induction that leads to 
increased secretion of TSH is considered not likely to be relevant for humans due to species-specific differences 
in thyroid hormone metabolism. However, the lack of TSH and thyroid hormone data is a shortcoming and there 
was an obvious gender effect regarding the osilodrostat-mediated liver tumours, the male rats and in particular 
the male mice being more prone than the females.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental program included studies on fertility and embryonic development in rats, 
embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits, and pre- and postnatal and juvenile development in rats. In the 
fertility and early embryonic study, female reproductive toxicity consisted of abnormal oestrous cycles, 
predominantly prolonged and profound decreases in mating and fertility at 50 mg/kg. No effects on male fertility 
or performance were seen, although transient low levels of testosterone were observed in occasional males in 
the juvenile study. 
In the developmental toxicity studies osilodrostat induced also early and late resorptions, decreased viable 
foetuses and caused foetal malformations and variations in rabbits and rats at ≥10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, 
respectively. In rabbits, there was an indication of dose-related increase of early resorptions and post 
implantation loss at ≥3 mg/kg/day. In rats, embryo toxicity was observed by various types of skeletal variations 
such as incomplete ossification of the supraoccipital, incomplete or bipartite ossification of sternebra and 
misshapen or fused sternebra. In rabbits, embryo toxicity consisted of skeletal variations such as bipartite 
ossification of sternebra or fused sternebra, and visceral malformation (anorchia) in one single foetus. 
In the peri-post natal study in rats, profound adverse effects on parturition index, mean duration of gestation 
(prolonged about 32 days), reduced live birth index, and some animals with dystocia were seen at the 20 mg/kg 
dose. This necessitated early termination of this group, and therefore osilodrostat-related effects on postnatal 
survival or development of pups in the 20 mg/kg/day group could not be evaluated. In the lower dose groups, 
in the F1 post weaning mating, there was a reduction in the mean number of implantations in the 5 mg/kg/day 
group. 
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance following oral administration was not explicitly investigated in the repeated-dose toxicity 
studies. However, no signs of changes in the gastrointestinal tract, that may be associated to local irritation due 
to osilodrostat, were reported in any of these studies.  
Osilodrostat did not cause skin irritation or corrosion in a GLP-compliant study in the rabbit.  Osilodrostat was 
classified as a skin sensitizer, Category 1A in a GLP-compliant Local Lymph Node Assay in the mouse.  
Other toxicity studies 
Osilodrostat spiked with the degradation products 540-07, 061-14 and 185-14 at 3.21%, 3.50 % and 3.1 %, 
respectively, did not induce mutations when adequately tested in five histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella 
typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA97a and TA102) at concentrations up to 5000 μg/plate in the absence 
and in the presence of a rat liver metabolic activation system (S9). 
The 4-week repeated dose toxicity profile for osilodrostat was similar between batches with or without the 
degradation products 540-07, 061-14 and 185-14 at 3.21%, 3.50 % and 3.1 %, respectively, indicating no 
additional safety risk. In addition, there were no statistically significant increases in micronucleus observed in 
any of the treatment groups compared to the controls.

2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Fpen was refined based on published literature data on prevalence resulting in a PECSURFACEWATER of 0.00237 
µg/L. This is below the trigger value for requiring a Phase II assessment, and a Phase II assessment was not 
provided. The provided log D at pH 4, 7 and 9 are -1.4 and 1.1 and 1.5, respectively, indicating that osilodrostat 
is not a PBT substance. The use of osilodrostat in the proposed indication is not considered to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Scientific Advice has been requested from CHMP on June 2013  with question regarding preclinical aspects. The 
recommendations given by CHMPS were that the general package of nonclinical data was sufficient for MAA 
evaluation and that the Applicant may need to further study the potential of osilodrostat to convert to the 
LCI1698 enantiomer. The advice given by CHMP has been followed.  
Osilodrostat has not been investigated for any other CYP enzymes than aldosterone synthases (CYP112B) and 
aromatase (CYP19A1). It is generally known that CYP inhibitors are promiscuous and it is possible that 
osilodrostat tends to inhibit particularly other steroid producing CYPs such as CYP17A1 and CYP21A2. The 
correlated enzyme activities i.e. hormone concentration of Progesterone and 17-OH Progesterone have not been 
monitored in the animal studies. But the Applicant provides an in vitro study performed in an adrenocortical 
tumour cell line showing that osilodrostat induces modest inhibitory effect on progesterone and 17-OH 
progesterone, as well as to testosterone (Creemers et al). However, in the clinical studies conducted in CD 
patients, testosterone appears to increase, particularly in females. Since in vitro conditions do not mimic in vivo 
situations, particularly for hormone signalling where regulatory feedback signals between endocrine effects 
cannot be assessed in vitro. The contradictory in vitro and vivo findings regarding testosterone can be due to a 
compensatory increase of ACTH in vivo. In men, testosterone is produced mainly from the testis whereas in 
women adrenal contribute to approximately 50 % of the testosterone production. Such compensatory 
stimulation of ACTH may be more sensitive in women. 
Osilodrostat and/or its metabolites crossed the blood brain barrier in rats and distributed in brain and spinal cord 
with a tissue-to-blood ratio ranged between 0.73 – 2.4 suggesting a potential for significant exposure in the 
brain. It is not possible to ensure that enough exposure to the major human circulating metabolite was achieved 
under the condition of the in vivo safety pharmacology studies. 2nd pharmacology data for the metabolite M34.5 
including CNS receptor binding assays did not reveal potential for off target effects. 
M34.5 was detected in vitro in rat, mouse, and monkey hepatocytes but neither in the human nor dog 
hepatocytes. The reason why the M34.5 was found in vivo, but not detected in the in human hepatocytes may 
be that M34.5 is formed at a slow rate since in experiments in hepatocyte co-cultures, M34.5 was observed 
following HPLC-radiometric detection in samples derived from the day 6 and day 7, but not in day 2 or earlier 
time points. The peak area associated with the M34.5 metabolite constituted ~1.4% and ~1.6% of the total 
chromatographic radioactivity derived from Day 6 or Day 7 samples, respectively. 
The Applicant has presented PK plasma concentration-time profile of the main metabolite M34.5, only after 
single dose administration of osilodrostat in rats (and humans). Hence, the extent of exposure to M34.5 
metabolite after repeat-dosing is unknown, and it cannot be experimentally verified if this metabolite has been 
adequately qualified regarding embryofoetal development (EFD) and carcinogenicity studies which are 
recommended (ICH M3(R2) guideline). Nevertheless as evidence of adequate exposure to this metabolite in the 
animals in the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies is lacking, and since PK parameters for M34.5 have not been 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 25/134 
  
  
  
 
measured following repeated dosing of osilodrostat in the clinic at the intended therapeutic dose, it is impossible 
to experimentaly establish safety margins with regards to the CNS (and QTc) findings as compared to the 
exposure achieved at steady state in the clinic. Distribution studies showed that osilodrostat (and/or 
metabolites) distribute in the brain but whether the major metabolite accumulates following repeat 
administration of osilodrostat remains unknown. Based on assumptions of linear kinetics of M34.5 both in 
human and in rats an estimated exposure margins of 0.9 (based on NOAEL of 2mg/kg/day) after repeated 
dosing was calculated. As the human exposure of M34.5 after repeat dosing of osilodrostat is only estimated in 
an uncertain simulation model, the addition of an uncertainty factor of 10 was used, resulting in exposure 
margin of 1.3 in the high osilodrostat dose (30 mg/kg/day) used in the chronic rat toxicity study ( 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity).  Thus, based on these extrapolations M34.5 has likely been toxicologically qualified. It is 
already established that osilodrostat has a potential for embryo-fetal toxicity which has resulted to strict 
warnings in relation to use in pregnancy in the SmPC, it is of less importance if this is due to osilodrostat itself 
or if M34.5 contributes.  As the human exposure of M34.5 after repeat dosing of osilodrostat is only estimated 
in an uncertain simulation model, the addition of an uncertainty factor of 10 was used, resulting in exposure 
margin of 1.3 in the high osilodrostat dose (30 mg/kg/day) used in the 2-year rat cancer study.  Thus, based on 
these extrapolations M34.5 has likely been toxicologically qualified. An in vitro binding study including a panel of 
73 G-coupled receptors, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes did not identify off-target 
activity for the major human metabolite M34.5 when tested at concentrations up to 30 µM. 
The changes in the zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex noted in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies are likely considered adaptive responses due to the inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone 
synthase, respectively. It remains unclear why in both species (rat and dog) females appeared more sensitive 
than males though there was only minor gender effect on osilodrostat exposure. An explanation could be related 
to the decreased levels of corticosterone in female rats but not in male rats given osilodrostat for 13 weeks 
despite at baseline the level of such a hormone was higher in females than in males. Nevertheless, as 
measurement of corticosterone was not systematically investigated but was done in one toxicology study only, 
whether a correlation exist between this biomarker and the incidence of the microscopic adrenal findings cannot 
be established. 
Osilodrostat-related effects on female reproductive organs were observed in repeated dose toxicity studies in 
mice and rats. Osilodrostat produced also embryo toxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. The NOAEL in 
foetal rats was 5 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately a 10-fold clinical AUC exposure and the NOAEL 
in foetal rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day that correspond to 0.6-fold the clinical AUC exposure. The applicant has not 
adequately addressed the low exposure margin in rabbit in section 5.3 of the SmPC (see SmPC comments). 
No mortality was noted in female rats in any of the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies conducted with 
osilodrostat (alone) at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day including in the EFD study 0770784. However, in the EFD 
study 1170415, four pregnant dams died following administration of 50 mg/kg osilodrostat containing the (-)-S- 
LCI698 at 0.07% or <0.006%, despite such an impurity alone at dose up to 0.03 mg/kg did not cause maternal 
toxicity.  
In the pre-and postnatal development study (PPND) in the rat, dystocia and delays in the start of parturition 
were observed at 20 mg/kg. Pup malformation were noted at 5 mg/kg but was not considered 
treatment-related.

2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
So conclusively it has been shown that osilodrostat inhibits human CYP11B1 in vitro and PCC in ACTH infused 
rats and monkeys, i.e. in animals mimic Cushing syndrome (high PCC) whereas in no species the baseline PCC 
is inhibited. Any toxicity associated with low cortisol/corticosterone levels could therefore not be assessed in the 
toxicity studies, but this is not considered critical for the overall assessment since adverse effects of 
hypocortisolism are clinically well known. The pharmacokinetics of a main osilodrostat metabolite, M34.5, has 
not been analysed after repeat dosing, and it is therefore not experimentally determined if the animals have 
been adequately exposed in the toxicity studies. However, based on extrapolation of PK data and osilodrostat 
dosing in the toxicity studies, M34.5 is considered adequately addressed from the non-clinical perspective. 
Osilodrostat related toxicity was confined to heart (as QT prolongation & TdP) CNS, liver, adrenal glands and 
female reproductive organs. In reproductive and developmental studies osilodrostat displayed embryo/foetal 
toxicity and teratogenicity. 
Osilodrostat is not considered as mutagenic or clastogenic in vivo. Overall, impurities have been qualified and/or 
are below limits, in conformity with the guidance on impurities ICH Q3A and ICH M7 for mutagenic impurities. 
Osilodrostat is not considered a PBT substance. The use of osilodrostat in the proposed indication is not 
considered to pose a risk to the environment. 
From a non-clinical view osilodrostat was considered approvable by CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis 
Plasma concentrations of osilodrostat were determined, after protein precipitation, using a HPLC-MS/MS 
method. The calibration range was 1-1000 ng/ml using 50 µL Na-EDTA plasma. 13C 2H4
15N-osilodrostat was used 
as internal standard. The assay was pre- and within study validated. The assay was further developed and 
cross-validated in the calibration range 0.5-50 ng/ml. 
The assay was further developed and validated in the concentration range 0.1-100 ng/ml osilodrostat, using 
K2-EDTA plasma and a sample volume of 100 µL.  
A chiral LC-MS/MS method was used for explorative determination of S-osilodrostat in plasma. The assay 
consisted of protein precipitation followed by evaporation and analysis of reconstituted extracts. The calibration 
EMA/653461/2019

range was 0.5-500 ng/ml using 100 µL sample volumes. The method was qualified with a mean bias of ±30% 
and a precision of ≤30%. 
Osilodrostat in the urine was determined after dilution and followed by analysis of the reconstituted samples by 
LC-MS/MS. The calibration range was 1-1000 ng/ml using a sample volume of 20 µL.  
LC-MS/MS methods for determination of caffeine and paraxanthine, dextromethorphan and dextrophan, 
omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole and midazolam, OH-midazolam, ethinyl-estradiol and levonorgestrel 
were also developed and validated for intended purposes.  
Absorption 
Osilodrostat demonstrated a high permeability in Caco-2 cells and a high solubility and is characterized as a 
BCS-1 compound. Active Pgp- and MRP-transport seem to be only marginally involved. 
An absolute bioavailability study has not been performed. 
Osilodrostat was rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 1-2h, consistent at all doses studied. Majority of 
dose administered was eliminated in urine (91%), suggesting that osilodrostat oral absorption is nearly 
complete, as expected for BCS Class I compounds. 
Concentration dependent PK, with a more than dose-proportional increase in exposure, was seen following 
single oral doses of 0.5-200 mg. A fairly dose proportional increase in exposure was seen after 0.5-3 mg od.  
Steady state was reached at day 2 following repeated dosing and the accumulation was 0.9-1.3 after od dosing. 
An accumulation ratio of 1.3 was determined based on PopPK analysis following 2-30 mg bid. 
A small decrease in exposure of osilodrostat was seen when co-administered with food (high fat meal), with a 
Cmax of 0.8-fold and an AUC of 0.9-fold compared to when dosed alone. 
A relative bioavailability comparison between the early capsule and the investigational tablet used in phase 3 
(equal to the to-be-marketed formulation) showed comparable exposure but with a lightly higher Cmax after the 
capsule. 
Distribution 
The median apparent volume of distribution was approximately 100 L. Based on PopPK analysis, the apparent 
volume of distribution was estimated to be 107 L for the central compartment (Vc/F) and to 326 L for the 
peripheral compartment (Vp/F). 
The fu (unbound fraction) for osilodrostat was 0.63 and independent of plasma concentration in the studied 
concentration range 0.02-100 µg/ml (0.09-440 µM). The CB/Cp ratio was determined to 0.85 and consistent with 
the blood-to-plasma ratio for total radioactivity 0.88 after an oral dose of [14C]osilodrostat. 
The fu for M34.5 was determined to 0.64. 
Metabolism 
No inter-conversion from administered R-osilodrostat (active) to S-osilodrostat was seen. 
Thirteen metabolites were characterized in the urine. Three large metabolites M16.5, M22 and M24.9 were 
identified with 17, 13 and 11% of the dose, respectively. M22 was identified as M34.5-glucuronide. 
Osilodrostat represents ca 20% of the total radioactivity in plasma following a single oral dose of 
[14C]osilodrostat 50 mg (3.7 MBq). Three large metabolites were identified M34.5, M16.5 and M24.9 with about 
51, 9 and 7% of total exposure of radioactivity, respectively. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 30/134 
  
  
  
 
The current data indicate a longer t1/2 of both M34.5 and M24.9 compared to osilodrostat, thus accumulation is 
expected at bid dosing. (M34.5 and M16.5 showed weak/no inhibitory activity in vitro but M24.9 was active with 
an IC50 of less than 12-fold as potent as osilodrostat (cf Non-clinical assessment). 
The formation of the largest metabolite in the urine M16.5 (direct N-glucuronide) was catalysed by UGT1A4, 2B7 
and 2B10. 
Twenty-four percent of the dose excreted in the urine as M24.9 (OH-osilodrostat) and its secondary metabolites 
M15 and M19.9 (11, 7 and 6% of the dose, respectively) was formed via CYP3A4, 2B6 and 2D6 mediated 
metabolism. 
Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as M34.5 (di-oxygenated osilodrostat) in the urine but 13% of the dose 
was identified as M22 (M34.5-glucuronide). The formation of M34.5 was concluded to be non-CYP-mediated as 
the metabolite was not identified in vitro. Thus 14% of the dose was eliminated via non-CYP-mediated 
metabolism that way. 
Six metabolites in the urine were identified as oxidative metabolites (M18B, M23.1, M16.4B, M6, M16 and M10), 
altogether 20% of the dose, but not identified in vitro and were concluded to be formed via 
non-CYP-metabolism. 
Elimination 
The elimination t1/2 was calculated to about 4h. 
Ninety-one percent of a [14C]osilodrostat dose was excreted in the urine and <2% in faeces. Ca 5% of the dose 
was excreted as parent compound in the urine. 
Time-dependency 
Based on population PK results, mean accumulation ratio (based on AUC) between single dose and steady state 
was approximately 1.3 and similar for all doses within therapeutic dose range 2-30 mg bid. 
PK in the target population 
The between-subject variability at steady-state AUC and steady-state Cmax were approximately 33 CV% and 22 
CV%, respectively, over the range of 2–30 mg. 
The systemic exposure of osilodrostat was about 1.3-fold higher in Caucasian subjects compared to Japanese at 
steady state. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Comparable systemic exposure of osilodrostat was seen in subjects with severe RI, ESRD and normal renal 
function following a single dose of osilodrostat 30 mg. 
Hepatic impairment 
Total systemic exposure increased with decreasing liver function with an AUC of ca 1.4- and 2.7-fold in moderate 
and severe HI compared to in healthy subjects. Cmax was ca 0.8-fold for mild, moderate and severe HI compared 
to subjects with normal liver function. 
Co-variates 
Based on PopPK, no dose adjustment is required based on gender, age and weight factor. But an effect of the 
race has been identified. The drug has mainly been studied in the Caucasian and Asian populations.

Interactions 
The PK interaction potential of osilodrostat has been evaluated in a number of in vitro studies and in two in vivo 
DDI studies. The interaction potential with the main metabolite M34.5 was also investigated in vitro. 
In vitro 
Osilodrostat is a substrate of 
− CYP3A4, 2B6 and 2D6 
− UGT1A4, 2B7 and 2B10 
Signals were shown for clinically relevant

No in vivo on the effect of other medicinal products on the PK of osilodrostat have been presented. 
Perpetrator 
−  Osilodrostat is a mild CYP2D6 inhibitor 
−  Osilodrostat was a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor after single dose in vivo, however, osilodrostat also has an in vitro 
signal for induction (both osilodrostat and M34.5) which is not explored in a single dose study. 
−  Osilodrostat did not show any clinically relevant effect on a combined oral contraceptive (CYP3A4/UGT 
substrate) in vivo following osilodrostat 30 mg bid for 7 days. It can be concluded that osilodrostat is not a 
potent PXR-inducer (not a sensitive substrate) but if a weak PXR-inducer is unknown. 
− 
It cannot be concluded that osilodrostat is characterized as moderate CYP1A2 inhibitor (about a 2.5-fold 
increase in exposure of a CYP1A2 substrate when co-administered) as the signal of induction in vitro cannot 
be evaluated after a single dose in vivo.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD of osilodrostat was investigated in healthy volunteers (studies A2101 and A2102, the latter compared 
the PD in Japanese and Caucasian subjects) and in patients with Cushing’s disease (study C2201). In addition, 
a thorough QT study (C2105) was conducted. 
Mechanism of action 
Osilodrostat (LC1699) is a potent, oral inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), the enzyme that catalyses the 
last step in the biosynthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland, thereby inhibiting cortisol synthesis. 
Figure 2 Site of action of osilodrostat (LCI699) in the aldosterone and cortisol synthesis pathways 
Primary pharmacology 
Osilodrostat was shown to cause dose-dependent inhibition of CYP11B1 in vitro. In the following, data from two 
studies in healthy subjects is summarised. 
Study A2101 – in healthy subjects 
This was a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo- and comparator-controlled (eplerenone), interwoven single- 
and multiple-ascending dose study. Part I consisted of five single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts, while Part II 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 33/134 
  
  
  
 
 
consisted of four multiple-ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Oral doses up to 200 mg were administered as a single 
dose, and daily doses up to 10 mg were administered orally for up to 14 days. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Part I: Single ascending dose 
Cortisol (plasma and urine) 
Following single doses of ≤100 mg LCI699, no significant changes in plasma cortisol were observed 12 or 24 hr 
post-dose. A single dose of 200 mg LCI699 did result in a 19% decrease in plasma cortisol 24 hr post-dose 
(p=0.029 compared to placebo). A significant reduction in 24 h urine cortisol (34-42%) was observed following 
single LCI699 doses of ≥30mg, compared to a 33% increase for placebo treatment (≤0.001; Figure 6).  
Figure 3 Change in 24 hour urine aldosterone and cortisol following single dose of LCI699 
The diurnal rhythm of cortisol was also maintained for all doses. While a clear dose-dependent inhibition of 
plasma cortisol was not observed following a single dose of LCI699, plasma levels of the cortisol precursor 
11-deoxycortisol did show an increase at ≥100 mg (p<0.001 compared to placebo) suggesting a compensatory 
rise due to inhibition of 11-β hydroxylase (CYP11B1). The increases in 11-deoxycortisol were statistically 
significant starting 1 hr post-dose for LCI699 doses of ≥100 mg, and were sustained through 24h post-dose 
(Figure 7). 
Figure 4 Plasma 11-deoxycortisol levels following single dose of LCI699 
Part II: Multiple ascending dose 
Cortisol (plasma and urine) 
LCI699 did not inhibit morning, basal cortisol at doses of 0.5 – 3 mg yet repeated doses of 10 mg LCI699 did 
cause a marked decrease in the diurnal cortisol pattern (Figure 8).  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 34/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Figure 5 Plasma cortisol on Days 1 and 7 
No significant decrease in plasma (AUC0-24h) or 24 h urine was observed on Day 1 or 7 for any dose. LCI699 did 
not inhibit ACTH-stimulated cortisol after 13 doses of 0.5 mg LCI699, however, following 13 doses of 1 mg 
LCI699, a 22% decrease in cortisol production upon ACTH-stimulation was noted. A categorical analysis was 
performed on these data to show the number and percentage of subjects that mounted a sufficient plasma 
cortisol response (≥ 500 mmol/l or ≥ 550 mmol/l). Note that at 1 mg, 25% of the subjects did reach a cortisol 
level of ≥ 550 mmol/l after ACTH stimulation, but all did achieve ≥ 500 mmol/l. In addition, a build-up of cortisol 
precursor (11-deoxycortisol) was observed at doses ≥3 mg LCI699, though only 10 mg showed statistical 
significance (p<0.001). 
No compensatory increase in trough or peak ACTH levels were observed at doses ≤ 3 mg. Following 6 doses of 
10 mg LCI699, trough ACTH levels had increased almost 200% (p<0.001), confirming the inhibitory effect of 
this dose of LCI699 on the transformation of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. 
Study A2102 – in Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects 
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single and multiple-dose study that compared the 
safety and pharmacokinetic properties of osilodrostat between Caucasian and Japanese subjects and explored 
pharmacodynamics in these two groups. A total of 83 subjects were randomized and received treatment (n=40 
Caucasian subjects, n=43 Japanese subjects). Four parallel groups (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/day and placebo) were 
used in this study. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Cushing’s disease-related PD results are summarized below: 
Cortisol: Single or multiple doses of LCI699 did not significantly impact the basal levels or the diurnal rhythm of 
plasma cortisol in Caucasians or Japanese populations. In addition, there was no effect on the 24-hour urinary 
cortisol concentration following single or multiple doses of LCI669 in either race. 
Plasma 11-deoxycortisol: Treatment with osilodrostat 1 mg b.i.d. dose for 14 days was associated with a greater 
increase in cortisol precursor, 11-deoxycortisol, in Japanese compared to Caucasian subjects. 
Plasma ACTH: The post-treatment increase in plasma ACTH levels was higher in Japanese (~5-fold) compared 
to that in Caucasian (~2-fold) population upon multiple dosing with 1 mg b.i.d. osilodrostat. 
ACTH-stimulated cortisol increase: The frequency of ACTH stimulation test failure in Caucasians was 0%, 11%, 
11% and 22% for PBO, 0.25 mg twice daily, 0.5 mg twice daily and 1 mg twice daily groups, respectively. 
Similarly, the frequency of ACTH stimulation test failure in Japanese was 0%, 11%, 22% and 70% for PBO, 0.25 
mg twice daily, 0.5 mg twice daily and 1 mg twice daily groups, respectively. Analysis of individual subject Cmax 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 35/134 
  
  
  
 
 
(or AUC) on Day 14 vs. failure of ACTH-induced cortisol test on Day 13 indicated that there was no clear 
exposure-dependency in subjects that passed or failed the test. However, the 1 mg b.i.d. dose in Japanese 
subjects who failed the ACTH test had a trend for higher exposure. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Study A2101 – in healthy subjects 
For study description, see above. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Part I: Single ascending dose 
Aldosterone (plasma and urine) 
A single dose of LCI699 (3-200 mg) resulted in a 60-77% reduction of plasma aldosterone levels by 12h 
post-dose, compared to a 30% decrease for placebo treatment (p=0.019 to 0.004). Reductions in plasma 
aldosterone were still observed 24 h post-dose (15-56% reduction compared to a 15% increase with placebo; 
p=0.002 to <0.001) for all doses. Decreases in time-normalized urine aldosterone (68-81%) were also 
observed following a single dose of LCI699, compared to a 25% increase for placebo patients (p,0.001; Figure 
6). No apparent dose response was observed in plasma or urine aldosterone levels; however, the 3 mg dose did 
appear to result in a less inhibition of plasma aldosterone at 24 h post-dose compared to the higher LCI699 
doses. 
Plasma renin activity (PRA) 
Following a single dose of LCI699, PRA increased with the 2 lowest doses (3 and 10 mg) having a >100% 
increase 24 h post-dose (p=0.004 and 0.042 compared to placebo), whereas doses >10 mg showed an increase 
similar to placebo (51-64% for LCI699 and 51% for placebo). 
Part II: Multiple ascending dose 
Aldosterone (plasma and urine) 
Similar to the results for the single-dose part of the study, LCI699 (0.5-10 mg) treatment resulted in a 60-77% 
reduction of plasma aldosterone levels 12h after the first dose (Day 1), while only a 30% decrease was observed 
in placebo treated subjects (Figure 9). Administration of LCI699 also resulted in a significant, dose dependent 
decrease in 24 hr urine aldosterone (40-74%) compared to Day-1 (p<0.001). However, by Day 7, pre-dose 
plasma aldosterone levels had increased in the 0.5 and 3 mg treated subjects, and the normal daytime decrease 
was noticeably enhanced in placebo subjects (Figure 9). These 2 effects resulted in essentially no difference in 
AUC0-24h of plasma aldosterone for subjects treated with 0.5 – 3 mg LCI699 compared to placebo on Day 7. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 36/134 
  
  
  
 
Figure 6 Plasma aldosterone on Days 1 and 7 
Due to the 4 hr half-life of the drug, AUC0-12h for plasma aldosterone was also calculated for Days 1 and 7. These 
results suggest that LCI699 consistently reduces aldosterone over the first 12 hours post-dose, but leads due to 
the 4 hr half-life an increase in aldosterone production over the second 12 hours, and hence 24 hour reductions 
in aldosterone are not observed. 
Plasma renin activity (PRA) 
An increase in PRA levels was observed after a single dose of ≥ 1 mg LCI699 (53-95%), however only the 1 mg 
dose was significantly different than placebo (p=0.04). Following repeated dosing with LCI699, trough PRA 
levels continued to increase. By Day 7 a dose-dependent trend was evident and levels had significantly 
increased compared to placebo (90, 158 and 287% for 0.5, 1 and 3 mg LCI699 compared to -23% for placebo 
p=0.006 to <0.001). The levels achieved by these LCI699 doses were higher than those observed with 100 mg 
eplerenone (56%; p=0.046 vs placebo). 
Electrolyte changes 
As expected for an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, changes in plasma and urine electrolytes (sodium and 
potassium) were observed. 
Urinary potassium excretion was increased with LCI699 by approximately 40% after 7 daily doses, whereas this 
increase was not noted in the eplerenone group. In the multiple dose part of this study, 7 subjects (all on 
LCI699) recorded a plasma potassium above upper limit of normal (ULN) after the switch to the higher 
potassium diet. All increases in potassium were either isolated (single incident), or transient (decreased upon 
retest), and no changes in ECG were observed. 
On Day 1 of treatment LCI699 increased sodium excretion to a similar extent as eplerenone (~60-110%) at 
LCI699 dose of ≤ 3mg. After 7 daily doses the increase in sodium excretion was more modest (~13-40%) and 
dose dependent. For placebo and eplerenone, the changes were ~19 and 26%, respectively on Day 7. Six 
subjects (all on LCI699) recorded plasma sodium levels at or below 135 mmol/l (hyponatremia) during the 
multiple dose part of the study. 
Aldosterone synthase precursor 
Inhibition of aldosterone should lead to a build-up of the aldosterone synthase precursor 11-DOC. No notable 
increase in unstimulated 11-DOC levels were observed for LCI699 dose ≤1 mg. In contrast, the 3 mg dose 
showed a marked increase in both trough and peak levels of 11-DOC, that increased with further exposure. Upon 
stimulation of the aldosterone pathway with ACTH, all 3 doses (0.5, 1 and 3 mg) showed augmented 11-DOC 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 37/134 
  
  
  
 
 
levels, suggesting significant inhibition of aldosterone synthase, and accumulation of its precursor. These 
increases were dose-dependent (with the 3 mg treated subjects reaching ~1200 pg/ml) and increased with 
prolonged exposure. These results suggest no accumulation of 11-DOC at LCI699 doses ≤1 mg, but a time 
dependent accumulation of this precursor at 3 mg. 
Study C2201 (Part I) - in patients with Cushing’s disease 
This (Part I) is a Phase II, open-label, single arm, sequential dose-escalation, multicenter study of osilodrostat 
in patients with Cushing’s disease.  
In addition to data on ACTH, cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, renin, aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone, serum 
samples were used to determine insulin, testosterone, oestradiol, IGF-1, TSH, free T4, LH, and FSH. Whole 
blood samples were used to determine HbA1c.

Effect on QT 
In both human and animal studies, osilodrostat showed concentration/dose-dependent QT prolongation and a 
potential to cause cardiac rhythm abnormalities, including torsades de pointes.  
The mechanism by which osilodrostat may cause QT-prolongation is not fully understood. 
However, hypokalaemia seen in CS is often associated with hypomagnesaemia and increases the risk of 
malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Worsening of hypokalaemia has been reported with adrenal-directed drugs 
that can increase cortisol precursors with mineralocorticoid activity. In addition, myocardial fibrosis caused by 
an enhanced responsiveness to angiotensin II and activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor in direct response 
to cortisol excess could exacerbate the effects of hypokalaemia on QT interval prolongation seen in patients with 
CS. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 39/134 
  
  
  
 
 
Preclinical studies have identified a potential for QT prolongation and arrhythmia with osilodrostat and in healthy 
volunteers, there was a positive correlation between osilodrostat concentration and ΔΔQTcF (study C2105 
described below). 
Study C2105 – thorough QT/QTc study 
Study C2105 was a single center, Phase I, randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg)-controlled, 
double blind, thorough QT/QTc study to assess the effect of single doses of osilodrostat (10 mg and 150 mg) on 
cardiac repolarization in 86 healthy male and female subjects. 
There was no relevant QT effect on osilodrostat 10 mg. The estimated maximum mean ΔΔQTcF was 1.73 ms 
(90% CI: 0.15, 3.31 ms) at 3 hour post-dose, and the upper bound of 90%CI of ΔΔQTcF was less than 10 ms at 
all time-points. However, the inter-individual variability is considerable (Figure 10). 
A maximum mean ΔΔQTcF of 25.4 ms (90%CI: 23.53, 27.22) was observed at 1 hour post-dose, at the 
observed Tmax on a single dose of osilodrostat 150 mg (5-fold higher than the maximum clinical dose of 30 mg). 
The regression analysis of concentration-response relationship based on the linear mixed effect model including 
Baseline QTcF as covariate indicated a positive correlation between the concentration and placebo-corrected 
changes of QTcF from Baseline values as shown in Figure 6. Based on the exposure-response relationship, 
predicted mean ΔΔQTcF was generated at the expected median of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax,ss) at 
30 mg b.i.d. as reported in the population PK analysis. Based on the population PK predicted median of Cmax,ss 
(232.26 ng/mL) following 30 mg b.i.d. dose, the mean ΔΔQTcF for 30 mg b.i.d. dose (the maximum 
recommended dose in clinical practice) is estimated to be 5.27 ms (90%CI: 4.12, 6.42), and the mean ΔΔQTcF 
for 20 mg b.i.d. dose is 3.53 ms (90%CI: 2.38, 4.69). 
Following administration of moxifloxacin 400 mg, QTcF exceeded the Baseline value from 0.25 hours post dose 
up to 24 hours post dose. The maximum ΔΔQTcF was observed at 4 hours post dose, and was 12.86 ms (90% 
CI: 11.14, 14.58). 
No subject experienced QTcF values >500 ms, or increases from baseline of >60 ms. The maximum effect at 
150 mg was observed at Tmax (1 hour post-dose). No dose-related effects were observed for the cardiac intervals 
(QRS, PR, or HR), or on blood pressure on osilodrostat 10 mg or 150 mg. 
Single dose administration of osilodrostat 10 mg and 150 mg was associated with over proportional increase in 
drug exposure. The geometric mean Cmax (%CV) of 57.9 ng/mL (25.2%) and 1190 ng/mL (18.5%), 
respectively, were observed at 1 hour post-dose. Elimination of osilodrostat was monophasic. The overall 
exposure levels for osilodrostat 10 mg and 150 mg were 359 ng·h/mL (28.2%) and 12200 ng·h/mL (19.4%), 
respectively, measured by geometric mean AUCinf (%CV). 
A negative correlation of osilodrostat concentration on serum cortisol level was present, with a predicted mean 
placebo adjusted cortisol change from Baseline of −40.22 nmol/L (90%CI: −55.66, −24.78) at the observed 
mean Cmax of 1210.66 ng/mL after a 150 mg dose of osilodrostat (p-value of <0.0001 for a slope of −0.04).

Figure 7 Placebo corrected QTcF change from period-specific time-averaged Baseline versus 
osilodrostat plasma concentration including inter-individual variability (Study C2105) (ECG 
analysis set) 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effects 
Based on original PK-PD modelling and simulation, 4 - 5 mg b.i.d. was expected to achieve a plasma 
concentration above the in vitro IC50 for CYP11B1 (2.5 nM) for a full 24-hour period. There was a broad range 
(up to 25-fold in osilodrostat dose) of inter-patient sensitivity to osilodrostat to achieve normalization of mUFC. 
Thus, individual dose titration was required. A starting dose of 2 mg b.i.d. and a maximum dose at 30 mg b.i.d. 
were chosen based on safety considerations. 
Dose titration was based on individual response and tolerability; therefore, no traditional exposure-response 
analyses were used to provide justifications to the recommended dosing regimen. The brief descriptive 
exposure-response analyses are summarized below. 
Exposure-efficacy 
An exposure-response relationship between the decrease in cortisol level (urine and serum) from baseline and 
osilodrostat exposure levels (Cmax, Ctrough and Cavg) was found based on the fitted Emax and linear mixed effects 
modelling analyses. However, as the dose titration scheme implemented in the study was affected by the 
cortisol level, it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion regarding the predictability of cortisol levels by osilodrostat 
exposure. 
Exposure-safety analysis for QTcF interval 
In the thorough QT Study C2105 (further assessed in 2.2.4. Study 2105), there was a positive correlation 
between osilodrostat concentration and ΔΔQTcF. The wider dose range and higher dose studied in this trial (i.e. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 41/134 
  
  
  
 
 
supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg) resulted in the detection of the positive correlation. In Study C2105, QTcF 
tended to decrease after a 10 mg dose but the maximum mean ΔΔQTcF revealed a small QTcF increase of 1.73 
ms (90% CI: 0.15, 3.31) at 3 hours post-dose. At a supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg, this study identified a 
maximum mean ΔΔQTcF of 25.38 ms (90% CI: 23.53, 27.22) at 1 hour post-dose. 
The relationship observed in Study C2301 should be interpreted with caution due to limited amount of 
information collected in the study (no pre-dose QT and no time-matched placebo control). No relationship was 
detected between osilodrostat concentration (dose range from 1 to 30 mg) and change of QTcF interval from 
baseline in Study C2301; the estimated slope for concentration in the linear mixed model was -0.02 (90% CI: 
-0.08, 0.03) for QTcF change from baseline. At the highest tested incident dose of 30 mg (median Cmax 167 
ng/mL), the model estimated a mean QTcF change from baseline of -2.13 ms (90% CI: -10.51; 6.24). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology program conducted was in line with the program proposed and accepted by the CHMP 
in the scientific advice. In line with the advice, the Applicant explored exposure-response relationships for a 
better understanding of exposure-efficacy/exposure-safety for optimization of future dosing paradigms. 
Pharmacokinetics 
One LC-MS/MS assay, with further development and validations/cross-validations, has been used for 
determination of osilodrostat in plasma.  
In the combined SAD/MAD study osilodrostat was given up to 200 mg as single doses. The MAD was original 
designed with ascending doses between 10-100 mg od, however, potent PD effects were seen thus repeated 
dosing for two weeks of 0.5, 2 and 3 mg od were evaluated. 
Osilodrostat was rapidly absorbed with a tmax of ca 1-2 h and steady state was reached by Day 2 following 
repeated dosing. The accumulation ratio of 1.3 with 2-30 mg bid. Osilodrostat can be taken without or with food 
as only a nonclinical relevant decrease in exposure was seen when osilodrostat was co-administered with a high 
fat meal.  
Osilodrostat is characterized as a BCS-1 compound ie a compound with high solubility and high permeability. 
However, a more than dose proportional increase in systemic exposure with increasing dose was seen and a 
dose-dependent relative bioavailability was identified in the PopPK analysis. The reason to the increasing 
bioavailability with dose is unknown and should be it should be mentioned in the SmPC 5.2 that exposure 
increased more than dose-proportionally over the therapeutic range. Nevertheless, as the proposed dosing 
regimen is dose titration based on response and tolerability with steps of 2 mg should not warrant extra caution. 
A relative bioavailability comparison between the early capsule and the investigational tablet used in phase 3 
trials (equal to the to-be-marketed formulation) was performed based on descriptive statistics. A rapid/very 
rapid dissolution was demonstrated for both formulations with cumulative percent after 15 or 30 min exceeding 
85% for the different strengths. A difference in mannitol between the two formulations exists, which may 
influence the bioavailability. But considering that osilodrostat is a BCS-1 compound and that the low total 
amount of mannitol is low both formulations, a significant difference in bioavailability is not expected. Thus, the 
results in the early studies following dose administration with the capsule can be used in the total evaluation of 
osilodrostat.  
Following a single oral dose of [14C]osilodrostat, ca 20% of the of the total radioactivity in plasma was identified 
as parent compound. The mean t1/2 of radioactivity was 24h and the t1/2 of osilodrostat has been determined to 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 42/134 
  
  
  
 
ca 4h. Three large metabolites have been identified M34.5, M16.5 and M24.9 representing ca 57, 9 and 7% of 
total plasma radioactivity, respectively. Considering the much longer t1/2 of radioactivity compared to 
osilodrostat implies that the metabolites have longer t1/2 than parent compound. The reported t1/2 of 22h for 
M34.5 agrees with the reported t1/2 of 24h for total plasma radioactivity, this can be expected as M34.5 
represents ca 60% of total plasma radioactivity. The single dose data are very uncertain as only one single data 
is available in the elimination phase. The proposed dose regimen is twice daily thus accumulation of M34.5 and 
M24.9 are expected. Simulated/ predicted exposure of M34.5, M24.9 and M16.5 at steady state following 
repeated dosing with osilodrostat 30 mg bid have been provided, based on a 1-compartment extravascular 
model fitted to the single dose data after osilodrostat 50 mg. The accumulation ratio was predicted to ca 10-, 4- 
and 2-fold for M34.5, M24.9 and M16.5, respectively, compared to 1.3-fold for osilodrostat. The single dose data 
are very uncertain as only few samples were collected in the elimination phase. The t1/2 seems, however, 
overpredicted leading to an overprediction in accumulation. Furthermore, the 30 mg dose is the maximum 
recommended dose while the expected maintenance dose is 2-7 mg. Thereby, 30 mg depicts an absolute worst 
case.    
The elimination t1/2 of osilodrostat was calculated to about 4h and most of an oral dose, 91%, was eliminated in 
the urine with ca 5% as parent compound. The elimination pathways are not fully presented thus the potential 
clinical consequences of concomitant medications cannot be foreseen. Polypharmacy is expected in patients 
diagnosed with Cushing syndrome. However, as dose titration, based on response and tolerability, is 
recommended at initiation of treatment and this will cover stable patients (impaired organ function, on 
co-medications etc). But the clinical consequences are unclear for changes during treatment e.g. 
addition/discontinuation of other medications. The SmPC 4.5 should be updated to include that patients should 
be closely monitored if co-treatment with strong CYP inhibitors or strong enzyme inducers are added or stopped, 
during ongoing treatment due to potential increase or decrease in systemic exposure of osilodrostat, 
respectively.   
Clinical consequences of potential genetic polymorphism have not been discussed in the current dossier. 
However, given the multiple enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways and that the dosing regimen is dose 
titration based on response and tolerability, no clinical consequences are expected due to genetic 
polymorphism. 
A PopPK model was developed using a data-driven approach. The methodology described by the Applicant was 
overall state of the art but several methodological and reporting issues were identified that need to be addressed 
before the results and conclusions from modelling are fully endorsed. 
The clinical consequences of osilodrostat when co-administered with other products and the risk of changing 
their PK and effect have not been completely investigated. PBPK modelling and simulation have been used to 
predict potential in vivo interactions with osilodrostat. This approach is appreciated; however, the platform 
cannot be considered qualified according to the EMA PBPK guideline. It has to be clearly stated in the SmPC, the 
uncertainties of potential effects of osilodrostat in vivo on other medicinal products when co-administered.  
CYP3A4 mediated metabolism is very common and polypharmacy is common in the targeted patient population. 
Potential clinical consequences following co-treatment with osilodrostat and sensitive CYP3A4 substrates should 
be able to predict. A small increase (1.5-fold) was seen in systemic exposure of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate) when dosed together with osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. However, the single dose DDI 
study is not predictable for the potential induction signal on CYP3A4 (PXR coupled enzymes). Osilodrostat did 
not show any clinically relevant effect on a combined oral contraceptive (estradiol/levonorgestrel CYP3A4/UGT 
substrate) following osilodrostat 30 mg bid for 7 days. Thus, it can be concluded that osilodrostat is not a potent 
PXR-inducer (not a sensitive substrate) but if a weak PXR-inducer is unknown. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 43/134 
  
  
  
 
The SmPC needs to be updated, especially with respects to potential drug-drug-interactions (SmPC 4.5) but also 
information on basic PK should be added in SmPC 5.2. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Osilodrostat blocks both the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone and was originally developed to treat patients 
with hyperaldosteronism but showed a larger effect on the HPA-axis and was further developed for the 
treatment of endogenous hypercortisolism. Due to the mechanism of action, a build-up of precursor may be 
expected. The mechanism of action for osilodrostat has been adequately described.  
In healthy subjects (study A2101), single doses of osilodrostat ≥30mg resulted in a reduction in urine cortisol, 
notably the urine cortisol increased in the placebo-treated group. The diurnal rhythm of cortisol was not 
affected. An increase in the precursor 11-deoxycortisol was increased. In the MAD part of study A2101, repeated 
doses of 10 mg osilodrostat resulted in a decrease in the diurnal cortisol pattern. At the 1 mg dose, there was an 
attenuated response to ACTH stimulation. This was observed in spite of the fact that osilodrostat was given once 
daily. A build-up of 11-deoxycortisol was observed as well as an increase in ACTH at a dose of 10 mg. 
In study A2102, the doses were lower than in study A2101. There appeared to be a stronger effect of 
osilodrostat in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects, otherwise the results were in line with the data 
obtained in study A2101. This is in line with the higher exposure observed in Japanese subjects. 
Effects on aldosterone and the renin-angiotensin system as well as effects on the HPG-axis are considered as 
secondary pharmacology effects.  
In the single dose part of study A2101, plasma aldosterone levels were decreased in both actively and 
placebo-treated groups, but to a larger extent in subjects treated with osilodrostat. There was no apparent dose 
response. In the MAD part of the study, osilodrostat was given once daily. With this regimen, aldosterone was 
decreased over the 12-hour post-dose period and then subsequently rose up and above the baseline level at Day 
7. A significant increase in PRA levels was observed. There was a modest increase in sodium excretion. A 
build-up of precursors, both 11-DOC and 11-deoxycortisol, was observed at doses exceeding 3 mg. ACTH was 
also increased at doses above 3 mg.  
Study C2201 (Part I) was the PoC study in patients with CD, the efficacy data from this study is further discussed 
in the efficacy part of this report. In this study, the effect of osilodrostat on the HPA-axis, thyroid hormones and 
sex hormones was evaluated. There was a marked decrease in aldosterone and renin. Due to the blocked 
cortisol synthesis, a build-up of precursors is expected and was indeed observed.  
The exposure-efficacy and safety analyses based on data from study C2301 is of limited valued since the 
exposure is conditioned on the cortisol response, and the exposure can thereby not be considered independent 
to the responses. Due to this limitation, the exposure-response analyses of cortisol response and ACTH are not 
assessed.   
Overall, ACTH levels were increased and although mean levels show modest increases below the threshold of 
clinical concern, individual patients may have ACTH values that are above the ULN. The SmPC has now been 
updated to inform the prescriber of the potential risk of increased ACTH levels.  The data further indicate an 
increase in testosterone in both males and females whereas there was a decrease in oestrogen in females and 
an increase in oestrogen in males. In male patients the increase in testosterone rather represent a normalisation 
of testosterone levels, whereas in female patients the increase in testosterone resulted in a mean level above 
ULN and associated events such as hirsutism and acne. These ADRs are listed in the SmPC and did not lead to 
discontinuations during the study. An additional statement is proposed in SmPC section 4.8 to highlight the role 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 44/134 
  
  
  
 
of precursor accumulation and testosterone increases in these events. The increased testosterone levels seem 
to be furthermore reversible in the female patients that entered a placebo period. 
Effects on DHEAS, FSH and LH are noted but toward normalisation due to cortisol level normalisation.  
As cortisol levels increase during a normal pregnancy, disruption of the cortisol synthesis is expected to have 
important impact on the mother and foetus. The actions to be taken in order to avoid exposure in pregnancy is 
further discussed in the safety and RMP sections of this report.  
The information regarding the exposure-QTc relation should be based on the TQT study (C2105). There was 
limited amount of QTc information collected in study C2301 and it is not considered reliable for 
exposure-response modelling. 
The thorough QT-study was adequately conducted. The data show that osilodrostat has a clinically significant 
effect on QT-prolongation. Although limiting the maximum dose to 30 mg would reduce the risk of 
QT-prolongation in susceptible individuals, this would not eliminate the risk taking the variety of exposure into 
account. The predicted exposure (Cmax) given doses from 2 to 30 mg, range (min, max) from 1.6 to 495 ng/mL.  
The risk of QT-prolongation is reflected in the SmPC. See also the safety section of this report.  
The potential impact of PD interactions between medication known to prolong the QT interval and osilodrostat is 
added in the SmPC section 4.5. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the PK of osilodrostat have been described but data are missing following repeated dosing on major 
metabolites. The data on osilodrostat as a potential perpetrator with respect to drug-drug-interactions are very 
limited. 
The mechanism of action and the primary pharmacology for osilodrostat have been adequately described and 
the primary pharmacology data are further supported by the clinical data. The secondary pharmacology and its 
implications for safety is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
No formal dose response study was conducted. Modelling of PK exposure estimated that a dose of 4 to 5 mg bid 
is expected to achieve a plasma concentration above the in vitro IC50 for CYP11B1 inhibition (2.5 nM) for a full 
24 hours for efficacy consideration. However, in Study C2201, a starting dose of 2 mg bid followed by individual 
dose titration was chosen based on mUFC response, tolerability and safety considerations, i.e., to reduce the 
risks associated with potential hypocortisolism-related AEs. This starting dose was also supported by the 
observations in the initial studies with normo-cortisolaemic subjects, where a notable reduction of 
ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion was seen already at 2 mg/day (given as either 2 mg qd or 1 mg bid). 
The rationale for bid dosing of osilodrostat is based on its half-life of 3 to 5 hours. The 10-week analysis of Study 
C2201 showed that the dose of osilodrostat required for normalization of mUFC ranged from 2 mg bid to 50 mg 
bid after individual dose titration, with nearly all patients (11/12) achieving mUFC normalization at >2 mg bid. 
Trough concentrations at mUFC normalization also varied widely, ranging from 0.336 to 204 ng/mL. This 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 45/134 
  
  
  
 
 
indicated that there was a broad range (up to 25-fold in osilodrostat dose) of inter-patient sensitivity to 
osilodrostat with respect to normalization of mUFC, and there was no apparent relation between the therapeutic 
dose or exposure (trough concentrations) needed for UFC normalization and the baseline mUFC. Thus, individual 
dose titration was required due to high inter-patient variability in effective dose and the potential for resulting 
AEs in sensitive patients (potential risk of hypocortisolism or acute adrenal insufficiency). Based on the available 
data, an individual dose titration starting at 2 mg bid was an appropriate method to assess the efficacy and 
safety of osilodrostat. The original titration plan was to escalate to a maximum of 50 mg bid in Study C2201. An 
exploratory post-hoc analysis of QTcF in relation to osilodrostat dose from an earlier Phase-I study (Study 
A2101) found substantial QTcF changes (some patients with QTcF prolongation >30ms) at single doses of 100 
and 200 mg. As a precaution, the maxim dose was lowered from 50 mg bid dose to 30 mg bid. 
In Study C2301, the osilodrostat dosing regimen was up-titrated following a 2 mg bid, 5 mg bid, 10 mg bid, 20 
mg bid, and 30 mg bid escalation sequence with the maximum dose of osilodrostat being 30 mg bid. The 
individual dose titration was required for the same reasons of high inter-patient variability seen in Study C2201. 
Dose increases were determined by the mean UFC based on three 24-hour UFC values collected every two 
weeks during the dose-titration period. The uptitration scheme was also governed by the desire to apply a 
limited number of uniform dose escalation steps in the confirmatory clinical trial setting while still allowing all 
patients the possibility to reach the 30 mg maximum dose if needed as well as the goal to achieve UFC control 
in all patients by week 12 while still allowing uptitration to be based on central laboratory UFC values. 
Main study 
C2301 – A Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study of LCI699 
following a 24 week, single-arm, open-label dose titration and treatment period to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of LCI699 for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s 
disease  
Methods 
Study C2301 is a Phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, RW study of osilodrostat following a 24-week, 
single-arm, open-label dose titration and treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osilodrostat for 
the treatment of patients with CD.

Figure 8 Schematic of core study design 
Descriptions of the study periods: 
Period 1 (Week 1 to Week 12) (dose-titration period): Patients were assessed for mUFC during the first 
two weeks of the dose-titration period and the dose of osilodrostat was adjusted accordingly. The dose was 
increased if mUFC was above the >ULN and was reduced if mUFC was below the lower limit of normal (LLN), or 
if the patient was symptomatic and mUFC was in the lower part of the normal range. The dose was maintained 
if mUFC was within the normal range and the patient did not have signs or symptoms of hypocortisolism or 
adrenal insufficiency. At Week 0 and Week 2, dose increases were not permitted. 
Period 2 (Week 13 to Week 24) (dose-titration and treatment period): During this period, the efficacy 
and safety of osilodrostat were assessed at the therapeutic dose as determined for attaining mUFC ≤ULN during 
the dose-titration period in Period 1. Patients with mUFC>ULN had their osilodrostat dose increased as tolerated 
and the maximum dose of 30 mg bid had not yet been reached. These patients were followed for long-term 
efficacy and were not considered responders for the key secondary endpoint, hence were not randomized in 
Study Period 3. 
Period 3 (Week 26 to Week 34) (RW period): Patients were eligible for randomisation (either to continue 
with osilodrostat or to switch to placebo) if they had completed the dose titration during study Period 1, and 
were classified as complete responders at Week 24 with no dose increase between Week 13 and Week 24. 
Randomisation was implemented at the Week 26 visit. Patients not eligible for randomisation received 
open-label osilodrostat until the end of the Core Period (Week 48), unless there was a reason to discontinue 
from the study prematurely. 
Period 4 (Week 34 to Week 48): At the end of Week 34, all patients received open-label osilodrostat 
treatment at a dose selected at the discretion of the Investigator. Dosing could also be adjusted based on the 
mUFC levels during this treatment period. 
Open extension period: Patients who continued to receive clinical benefit, as assessed by the study 
Investigator and who wished to enter the extension period, had to be re-consented at Week 48. Patients who 
entered the extension period did so without interruption of study drug or scheduled assessments. The optional 
extension period will end after all patients have completed Week 72 or discontinued prior to Week 72.

Study Participants 
Key inclusion criteria 
Male or female patients 18 to 75 years old with confirmed persistent or recurrent CD as evidenced by mUFC 
>1.5×ULN at screening, morning plasma ACTH above the LLN and confirmed pituitary source of excess ACTH 
were included.  
Patients with de novo CD were included only if they were not considered candidates for surgery (e.g. poor 
surgical candidates, surgically unapproachable tumours, patients who refuse to have surgical treatment, or 
surgical treatment was not available). Patients with a history of pituitary irradiation were included, provided that 
at least 2 years (for stereotactic radiosurgery) or 3 years (for conventional radiation) had elapsed from the time 
of last radiation treatment to the time of enrolment into this study. Patients were permitted to washout current 
drug therapy to meet these entry criteria if they had known diagnosis of CD. Rescreening was used as needed 
to ensure washout was complete.  
Key exclusion criteria 
Patients with compression of the optic chiasm due to a macroadenoma or patients at high risk of compression of 
the optic chiasm were excluded. 
Patients who had a known inherited syndrome as the cause for hormone over secretion and patients with CS due 
to ectopic ACTH secretion or ACTH-independent (adrenal) CS were excluded. 
Patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes were excluded. 
In addition, hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure, diabetic patients with poorly controlled 
diabetes and patients who were not euthyroid were to be excluded. 
Patients with a history of significant CV disease, moderate to severe renal impairment or significant liver disease 
were also excluded. 
Treatments 
Study Period 1, 2 and 4, as well as the Extension Period were single treatment group designs using open-label 
osilodrostat. 
The osilodrostat dosing regimen was up-titrated following a 2 mg bid, 5 mg bid, 10 mg bid, 20 mg bid, and 30 
mg bid escalation sequence. If hypocortisolism occurs at 2 mg bid, the dose can be lowered to 1 mg bid or lower, 
e.g., 1 mg once daily or 1mg every other day, if needed. The up-titration continued until the mUFC ≤ ULN. 
Figure 9 Schematic of study Period 1 
Once the patient’s mUFC was controlled (mUFC ≤ ULN) during the dose titration period, intermediate doses (i.e., 
3 mg bid, 7 mg bid and 15 mg bid) could be given. 
The maximum dose of osilodrostat in this study was 30 mg bid. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 48/134 
  
  
  
 
 
In study Period 3, eligible patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion at Week 26 at a 1:1 ratio either 
to continue treatment with osilodrostat at the same dose or to receive matching placebo. 
Dose adjustments during RW 
The dose of study drug (osilodrostat or placebo) remained unchanged for patients who maintained a normal 
mUFC and did not develop AEs related to study drug during RW. The Investigator could reduce or temporally 
withhold a dose of study drug for safety reasons at any time during the study, including the RW Period. Dose 
reductions or interruptions for safety reasons during the RW Period did not preclude the possibility of a complete 
response at Week 34. Dose increases were not permitted during the RW Period. 
Discontinuation from RW 
During study Period 3, a patient was discontinued from the RW Period and declared a non-responder, if the 
mUFC increased to >1.5×ULN, and at least 2 individual urine samples showed UFC >1.5×ULN at a single visit 
(scheduled or unscheduled). 
After discontinuation from RW treatment, or at the end of the RW Period (Week 34), whichever came first, the 
patient resumed open-label osilodrostat at a dose selected by the Investigator. 
Patients who discontinued from the study during the RW Period were no longer in the study, and consequently 
they were not permitted to receive open-label osilodrostat and could not move to study Period 4. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to compare the complete response rate at the end of the 8-week period of 
randomization withdrawal (RW) (Week 34) between patients randomized to continued osilodrostat therapy vs. 
placebo. 
Key secondary objective 
To assess the complete response rate at the end of individual dose-titration and treatment with osilodrostat in 
the initial single-arm, open label period (Week 24).

Randomisation and blinding 
The study 2301 had a randomised withdrawal design. 
In order to be eligible for randomisation, patients must have completed dose titration during the first 12 weeks, 
continued on LCI699 treatment with no further dose increase during Weeks 13-24, and have normal UFC (mUFC 
≤ ULN) from urine samples collected at Week 24. Randomisation was implemented at the Week 26 visit. Patients 
that were not eligible for randomisation were followed on open-label LCI699 until the end of the core treatment 
(Week 48), unless there was a reason to discontinue from the study prematurely. 
Eligible patients were randomised in a double-blinded fashion at Week 26 at a 1:1 ratio either to continue 
treatment with LCI699 at the same dose or to matching placebo. Patients were stratified at randomisation 
according to: LCI699 dose at Week 24 (≤ 5mg bid. vs. > 5 mg bid.), and history of pituitary irradiation (yes/no). 
Patients, Investigator, and persons performing the assessments (with the exception of drug supply 
management personnel) remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization 
(Week 26) until database lock.  
The Applicant’s Drug Supply Management department members were not blinded to the identity of the 
treatment in order to prepare the study drug supplies. Unblinding was only permitted in the case of patient 
emergencies 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: The following analysis populations were defined  
Randomised analysis set (RAS): comprised all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of 
randomised drug (osilodrostat or placebo). Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analysed 
according to the treatment and stratum they have been assigned to during the randomisation.  
Full analysis set (FAS): comprises all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of osilodrostat.  
Safety set: There were two safety sets defined in this study.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 50/134 
  
  
  
 
 
a.  Safety analysis set (SAS) comprises all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of osilodrostat 
and had at least one valid post-baseline safety assessment.  
b.  Safety Analysis Set for randomized withdrawal period (SASR) comprises only randomized patients who 
received at least one dose of randomized treatment (osilodrostat or placebo) and had at least one valid 
safety assessment during the randomized withdrawal period.  
Per-Protocol set: There were two per-protocol sets defined in this study.  
a.  Per-Protocol Set for RAS (PPRAS) consists of a subset of the patients in the RAS who had no selected 
clinical study report (CSR)-reportable protocol deviation.  
b.  Per-Protocol Set for FAS of a subset of the patients in the FAS who had no selected CSR-reportable 
protocol deviation.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS): consists of all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of 
osilodrostat and have at least one evaluable post-dosing pharmacokinetics assessment.  
Analysis of the primary endpoint: The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of randomized patients in 
each treatment arm that are complete responders at the end of the 8 weeks of the randomized withdrawal 
period (Week 34). A Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel exact test stratified by the two stratification factors at 
randomization was performed using the Randomized Analysis Set (RAS) following the intent-to-treat principle. 
The test was performed at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. Patients who discontinued during the randomized withdrawal 
period will be counted as non-responders for the primary endpoint. Patients with mean UFC > 1.5 x ULN (with 
at least 2 of the 3 individual UFC levels > 1.5 x ULN) during the randomized withdrawal period were to be 
discontinued from randomized withdrawal and changed to open-label treatment with LCI699. The applicant was 
asked to provide more information on patients that fulfilled these criteria, and clarified that two patients (one 
was withdrawn and one was not) randomised to osilodrostat and 21 patients (10 were withdrawn (including 
patient 200500013 who withdrew from the study) and 11 were not) randomised to placebo met the criteria. 
Key secondary endpoint: The key secondary efficacy variable was the proportion of complete responders at the 
end of 24 weeks of dose-titration and treatment with LCI699 in the initial single-arm, open label part of the trial, 
using the Full analysis set (FAS). The analysis of the key secondary objective was based on the 2-sided 95% 
exact confidence interval (Clopper-Pearson method), which was compared with the limit 30%, in order to be 
able to state that the complete response rate is considered at least 30% after 24 weeks of treatment with 
LCI699. This endpoint was tested sequentially after the primary endpoint, in order to preserve of the overall 
2-sided type 1 error at 5%. 
Subgroups: Predefined subgroups for this study were the two stratification factors for randomization: history of 
pituitary irradiation, and LCI699 dose at Week24:  
•  History of pituitary irradiation: Yes and No  
• 
LCI699 dose at Week24: ≤ 5mg b.i.d. and > 5mg b.i.d. 
Missing data: The mean of the results from the 3 samples was used to obtain the corresponding mUFC level for 
a given assessment. If a patient had two or more missing UFC values for a particular visit, the mUFC assessment 
for that patient at that visit was considered missing. Otherwise, the mean of UFC collections was considered as 
the mUFC level for that visit.  
Randomized patients who discontinued during the RW Period or had a missing mUFC assessment at end of the 
RW Period (Week 34) were counted as non-responders for the primary endpoint.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 51/134 
  
  
  
 
Supportive and sensitivity analyses: An un-stratified Fisher’s exact test of the primary endpoint using RAS was 
performed as a supportive analysis to the primary analysis. In addition, both stratified CMH exact test and 
un-stratified Fisher’s exact test of the primary endpoint were performed using PPRAS. The key secondary 
endpoint was also analysed using PPFAS. 
Interim analyses: The current study report is based on interim data, with long term safety follow up still ongoing. 
The study had no interim analysis for purpose of adaptation of the study. 
Results 
Participant flow 
This study was conducted in 66 centers across 19 countries. A total of 202 patients were screened for the study, 
of which 137 were enrolled and 65 patients were screening failures. Nineteen patients discontinued at or prior to 
Week 26. Of the remaining 118 patients, 71 patients were randomized (36 to osilodrostat and 35 to placebo) 
and 47 patients who were not randomized continued on open-label osilodrostat treatment (Figure 13, Table 14). 
Patients were not randomized for the following reasons: 
•  19 patients had their dose increased beyond the established one at Week 12 (i.e., the end of the dose 
titration period) although they met the mUFC normalization criteria,  
•  20 patients did not meet the mUFC normalization criteria at Week 26,  
•  7 patients did not meet both of the previous criteria and  
•  1 patient was not randomized due to Investigator decision. 
At the time of data cut-off date, 35 patients had discontinued the study (24 during the Core Period and 11 during 
the Extension Period). 
During the Core Period, 5 patients discontinued after Week 26 but prior to Week 48. Of note, only one patient, 
who was randomized to placebo, withdrew from study during the RW Period on Day 220. The most common 
reasons for discontinuation during the Core Period were AE (10.9%, 15/137), followed by patient withdrew 
consent (2.9%, 4/137), and physician’s decision (2.2%, 3/137) (Table 14). A total of 106 patients (77.4%) 
entered the optional extension, of which 95 (69.3%) patients were still on treatment at the time of the data cut 
off date.

Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were representative of a patient population with CD. The 
disease history and other baseline characteristics were generally well balanced in the patients who were later 
randomized to osilodrostat or placebo treatment groups during the RW Period (Table 15).

Table 7 Demographics summary by randomized treatment group (FAS) - Study C2301  
Disease history characteristics 
The median time to the first osilodrostat dose since initial CD diagnosis was 47.2 months (range: 2.1-286.7) and 
most patients (87.6%) had persistent/recurrent CD.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 56/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Overall, 95.6% had received treatment for CD prior to study entry, and 87.6% of patients had previously 
undergone surgery. Forty-five patients (32.85%) had at least two previous neurosurgeries and 9 patients 
(6.57%) had at least three previous neurosurgeries. A large proportion of patients (74.5%) had been treated 
with other medication for CD prior to study entry (such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, cabergoline and 
pasireotide. 
The mean (standard deviation (SD)) mUFC at baseline was 1006.0 nmol/24h (1589.86); this corresponds to 
approximately 7×ULN. The median mUFC at baseline was 476.4 nmol/24h (range: 35.6 to 9611.6); this 
corresponds to approximately 3.5×ULN. 
Relevant medical history and current medical conditions 
All patients (N=137) reported at least one relevant medical history/current medical condition. Overall, the most 
common conditions were: hypertension (93/137, 67.9%), obesity (41/137, 29.9%), osteoporosis (38/137, 
27.7%), diabetes mellitus (30/137, 21.9%), depression (27/137, 19.7%) and hypothyroidism (25/137, 
18.2%). 
Relevant medical histories and current medical conditions were similar in the patients who were later 
randomized to osilodrostat or placebo treatment groups during the RW Period.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results – Week 34 complete response rate - Study C2301 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met. The null hypothesis that the complete response rates at the end of 
8-week RW Period (i.e. at Week 34) were the same between the two randomized groups was rejected. 
Osilodrostat was superior to placebo at Week 34, the end of the RW period, in maintaining biochemical control 
(mUFC to ≤ ULN) in patients with CD showing statistical significance (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] exact 
test 2-sided p<0.001) (Table 17). The complete response rate in the osilodrostat arm was higher at 86.1% 
(95% CI: 70.5, 95.3) than that in the placebo arm at 29.4% (95% CI: 15.1, 47.5) (odds ratio of osilodrostat vs. 
placebo = 13.7; 95% CI: 3.7, 53.4). Ten patients in the placebo arm (29.4%) did not lose mUFC control at the 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 57/134 
  
  
  
 
 
end of the RW Period. In 9/10 patients, mUFC increased at the end of Week 34 close to the ULN. This finding was 
expected considering the individual response in mUFC. This is also consistent with the observation in Study 
C2201 where mean mUFC returned to baseline after 2 weeks following discontinuation of osilodrostat, although 
some patients maintained UFC<ULN for a longer period of time.

A primary efficacy responder is defined as a randomized patient who has mUFC ≤ ULN at Week 34 and who was neither 
discontinued (study or randomized withdrawal treatment) nor had osilodrostat dose increase above the level at Week 26 during 
the randomized withdrawal period of the study. Patients who discontinued during the randomized withdrawal period were 
counted as non-responders for primary efficacy. 
CI: confidence interval; CMH: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; RAS: randomized analysis set. 
Supportive analysis for the primary endpoint 
The robustness of the primary analysis was confirmed by the predefined supportive analyses, one based on the 
Randomized analysis set (RAS) and one based on the Per-protocol RAS (PPRAS), further supporting the efficacy 
of osilodrostat in controlling the notably high mUFC values in patients with CD. 
Key secondary results – Week 24 complete response rate - Study C2301 
The study also met its key secondary objective. At Week 24, 72 patients (52.6%) were responders in the FAS 
(95% 2-sided CI: 43.9, 61.1). The lower bound of the 95% CI was above the pre-specified threshold for 
significant clinical benefit (i.e., ≥ 30%). However, the number of controlled patients at Week 24 was 93/137 
(67.9%). Hence an additional 21 patients had normal mUFC at Week 24 but they were not considered eligible for 
randomization.

Proportion of mUFC responders over time 
The proportion of patients with mUFC ≤ ULN responding to treatment with osilodrostat remained consistent over 
time for ‘All patients’, patients without prior surgery and patients in the non-randomized arm (Table 18).

Up to the time of the last available assessment, response rates were consistent with those for ‘All patients’ at 
Week 12. An overall response rate of 88.3% (95% CI: 81.73, 93.18) with 71.5% (98/137) (95% CI: 63.20, 
78.91) being complete responders and 16.8% (23/137) being partial responders (95% CI: 10.95, 24.12). 
The durability of response rate was evident with 64 patients (66.0%) in the FAS who had initial normalization of 
mUFC were still considered to be responders after at least 6 months (95%: 55.7, 75.3). 
Change in mUFC from baseline during the study 
In Study C2301, mUFC levels (≤ ULN) were maintained without any consistent dose increase as evidenced by 
the total daily dose of osilodrostat with the range of doses consistent between 10 mg/day to 12 mg/day (Figure 
14).  
During treatment with osilodrostat, the mean mUFC levels decreased from high baseline values stabilizing to a 
normal level (mUFC ≤ UFC) around Week 6 in most patients at an average total daily dose of 8.6 mg/day (Figure 
14). After Week 6, normal mUFC (≤ ULN) levels were observed in most patients with the exception of 
non-randomized patients at Week 20 to Week 24 and patients randomized to placebo at Week 28 to Week 34 
(Figure 14). Normalized mUFC (≤ ULN) levels were maintained at Week 24 at an average total daily dose of 
10.7 mg/day and at Week 48 at 11.0 mg/day.

Sorting is by baseline mUFC value. 
The horizontal reference line is the upper limit of normal range = 138 nmol/24hr. 
A repeated measures analysis of mUFC shows a consistent biochemical effect of osilodrostat during the study. At 
Week 2, there was approximately a 42% reduction in the adjusted mean mUFC value from baseline. After the 
dose-titration period (Week 12), there was approximately an 85% reduction that was maintained until the end 
of the Core Period (89%). 
Change in mUFC from randomization during the RW Period 
At randomization (Week 26), mean (SD) mUFC levels were similar in the osilodrostat arm (70.9 nmol/24h, 
SD=43.53) and placebo arm (79.1 nmol/24h (57.90). Once patients stopped treatment with osilodrostat at 
Week 26 and were randomized to receive placebo, mUFC levels increased rapidly (Figure 16). Only data while 
the patients were on RW medication are included. At the end the RW period and when patients resumed 
treatment with osilodrostat, mUFC levels decreased quickly. 
At the end of the 8-week RW Period (Week 34), the median mUFC levels were lower in the osilodrostat arm (50.1 
nmol/24h; range: 11.9 to 610.8) compared with the placebo arm (139.7 nmol/24h; range: 29.8 to 849.5). This 
corresponded to a median percent change from randomization of -13.9% (-70.1 to 1019.9) in the osilodrostat 
arm and 174.6% (-58.1 to 2588.8) in the placebo arm.

The repeated measures analysis of change in mUFC shows a consistent biochemical effect of osilodrostat over 
placebo during the RW Period. In the osilodrostat arm there was approximately a 10% reduction from the mean 
mUFC at randomization baseline during the RW period. However, in the placebo arm, there was up to a 200% 
increase in the mean mUFC from randomization during the same period. 
Time to first-controlled mUFC response 
During the course of the study, 132 patients of 137 (96.4%) achieved biochemical control (mUFC ≤ ULN) at 
least once while on study treatment. The median time from the start of treatment with osilodrostat to the 
first-controlled mUFC response was 41 days (95% CI: 30.0, 42.0) for all patients with similar first-control in 
patients in the osilodrostat arm (41.0 days, 95% CI: 28.0, 47.0) and in the non-randomized arm (42.0 days, 
95% CI: 37.0, 55.0). 
Time to loss of control during the randomized withdrawal period 
During the RW period, two (5.6%) patients of 36 in the osilodrostat arm had a loss of mUFC control (of the two 
patients, one patient required a dose interruption due to AEs) compared with 20 patients (58.8%) of 34 in the 
placebo arm. The median time to loss of control of mUFC was not estimable (NE) in the osilodrostat arm and was 
28 days in the placebo arm. 
There was a 94% lower risk of losing mUFC control in the osilodrostat group compared with the placebo group 
(HR=0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.28) during the RW period. 
Protocol-defined ‘time to escape’ 
In Study C2301, the protocol definition of ‘escape’ is as follows: Escape is defined as the first loss of control of 
UFC after at least one instance of UFC normalization that meets all of the following criteria: prior normalization 
of UFC had occurred (mUFC≤ ULN); both the mUFC and at least two individual values contributing to that mUFC 
had to be >1.5×ULN; and the loss of control of UFC had not been related to a dose interruption or dose reduction 
due to safety reasons; happens beyond 12-week dose titration period (Study Period 1). 
When considering ‘escape’ according to the protocol, it is in contrast with the following: 
• 
• 
The mean mUFC overtime in the ‘All patient’ group remains <ULN for most of the time during the study 
without a need for dose increase as seen in Figure 14. 
The proportion of complete responders remains high over time up to 48 weeks, too, as seen in Table 18. 
The durability of response rate was evident with 64 patients (66.0%) in the FAS were still considered to 
be responders after at least 6 months (95%: 55.7, 75.3) from the initial normalization of mUFC. 
•  Many of the patients who had an escape event regained mUFC control with or without a osilodrostat dose 
increase. 
With a rather conservative protocol definition of ‘escape,’ the median (KM method) time to ‘escape’ was 560 
days (95% CI: 212.0-NE); a median follow-up of 253 days was observed in patients treated with osilodrostat. 
Other efficacy results 
As per the protocol and SAP, no imputation for missing data was specified and hence change from baseline was 
calculated based on observed case data. 
Serum cortisol levels 
EMA/653461/2019

Individual dose-titration over 12 weeks achieved control of serum cortisol levels. Compared to baseline, patients 
had a sustained reduction in mean serum cortisol levels during the dose-titration period of the study (up to Week 
12) (Figure 17). During study Period 2 (Week 13 to Week 24) the decrease in mean serum cortisol levels was 
maintained with mean cortisol levels being within the normal range in the ‘All patients’ grouping. During the RW 
Period, as was expected, an increase in mean cortisol levels was observed in patients taking placebo when 
compared with those taking osilodrostat. In these patients, the mean cortisol levels decreased upon resuming 
osilodrostat. At the end of the Core Period (Week 48), the mean serum cortisol levels were within the normal 
range in the ‘All patients’ grouping. 
For ‘All patients’ (N=134), mean (SD) serum cortisol levels were high (630.2 (248.87) nmol/L) at baseline 
decreasing to 313.4 (157.46) nmol/L at Week 12, 323.3 (146.79) nmol/L at Week 24, and 304.2 (134.43) 
nmol/L at Week 48. At Week 48, the mean (SD) percentage change from baseline in serum cortisol levels 
was -44.9% (29.31).

Cardiovascular-related metabolic parameters 
Treatment with osilodrostat led to an overall improvement in key cardiovascular-related metabolic parameters 
associated with hypercortisolism at Week 48 (Table 19). The repeated measures analysis of change from 
baseline in cardiovascular- and metabolic-related parameters associated with endogenous hypercortisolism 
shows a consistent and cumulative improvement throughout the study with osilodrostat in all parameters.

Physical features of hypercortisolism 
As early as Week 12, 70.3% of patients had improvement in at least one physical feature associated with 
hypercortisolism (facial rubor, dorsal fat pad, central (abdominal) obesity, supraclavicular fat pad, whereas 
approximately one third had a favourable shift from baseline for ecchymosis (bruising), proximal muscle wasting 
(atrophy), striae and hirsutism (in female patients only). 
At the end of the Core period (Week 48), 83/97 patients (85.6%) with an assessment had improvement in at 
least one physical feature in CD. 
Bone mineral density 
Both male and female patients in Study C2301 had decreased bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with 
that found in a gender- and age-matched population without endogenous hypercortisolism. During the study, 
treatment with osilodrostat led to an increase from baseline in BMD in the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and total hip at 
Week 48. A mean (SD) percentage change from baseline of 3.0% (6.45) was reported for L1-L4 of the lumbar 
spine and of 0.4% (5.48) for total hip BMD at Week 48 and the improvement was more pronounced in male 
patients compared with female patients.  
Patient reported outcomes during the Core period 
Cushing QoL 
Increases from baseline for Cushing QoL total score (indicative of improvement) were observed in the All 
Patients group (N=137) at all post-baseline visits. These changes and the adjusted mean change from baseline 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 64/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
occurred early after initiation of treatment and reached the distribution-based minimal important difference 
value (MID; corresponding to a minimum 10.1 point change from baseline) at Weeks 26, 30, 32, 34 and 48. 
Furthermore, improvement was observed for ‘All patients’ (N=137) for the Cushing’s QoL subscales of ‘physical 
problems’ and for ‘psychosocial issues’. These changes including the adjusted mean change from baseline 
reached the distribution-based MID value (10.1 point change from baseline) for the ‘physical problems’ subscale 
at Weeks 12, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 and 48 and for the ‘psychosocial issues’ subscale at Weeks 30, 32, 34, and 
48. 
EQ-5D utility index 
Changes from baseline, indicative of improvement for EQ-5D utility index, were observed for ‘All patients’ 
(N=137) at all post-baseline visits. These changes reached the lower-bound MID value (score difference of 
0.037-0.069) at Weeks 4, 24, 26, 30, 34, and 48. The adjusted mean change from baseline on the utility index 
score reached the MID value (score increase of 0.037-0.069) at Week 4, 16, 24, 26, 30, 34 and 48. 
BDI 
Changes from baseline on BDI-II total score indicative of improvement were observed in the ‘All patients’ group 
(N=137) at all post-baseline assessments. These changes reached the MID values (17.5% reduction in scores 
from baseline) at Weeks 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, and 48. 
The adjusted mean change from baseline on the BDI-II total score shows a decrease from mean change of -2.31 
(95% CI: -3.61, -1.00) at Week 4 to -5.52 (95% CI: -7.10, -3.93) at Week 48 in the Osilodrostat Group. These 
changes are indicative of improvement at each visit. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint at Week 34 (Figure 18) with odds ratio and associated 95% CI 
demonstrate consistency with the overall population. Subgroup analyses of the response rate at Week 24 
demonstrate consistency with that reported for the overall population in clinically meaningful mUFC response 
rates across all subgroups at Week 24 of the study (Figure 19). 
The analysis in some subgroups are based on limited numbers of patients; therefore, no definitive conclusions 
should be drawn for these subgroups.

Responder at the end of the randomized withdrawal period (Week 34) was defined as a randomized patient who has mUFC 
≤ ULN at Week 34 and who was neither discontinued nor had an osilodrostat dose increase above the level at Week 26 during 
the randomized withdrawal period of the study. Patients who discontinued during the randomized withdrawal period were 
counted as non-responders for primary efficacy. 
Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was based on Fisher exact method. Some odds ratios have an upper limit of the 
confidence interval greater than 100. However in order to improve the layout, the upper limit is capped at 100.

Responder at Week 24 is defined as a patient in FAS who has mUFC ≤ ULN at Week 24 and the dose of osilodrostat during 
Study Period 2 (Weeks 13-24) was not increased above the level established at the end of Study Period 1 (Week 12). Patients 
who had missing mUFC assessment at Week 24 were counted as non-responders for the key secondary endpoint.

N is the number of patients in the FAS. The vertical reference line on the x-axis is at 52.6 - the response rate for ‘All patients’. 
2-sided 95% Confidence Intervals are based on the exact (Clopper-Pearson) method. 
Subgroup analyses in Japanese and non-Japanese patients 
Reductions of mUFC levels were similar when examined in a subgroup of Japanese patients compared with 
non-Japanese patients. High baseline levels of mUFC were reduced in both groups by Week 2 and were stabilized 
to mUFC (≤ ULN) prior to Week 6 in the Japanese patients and by Week 8 in the non-Japanese patients. 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses by treatment group, race and region 
Overall, mUFC response rates tended to be lower and average daily doses tended to be higher in the 
non-randomized treatment group. These results were expected since these patients were not mUFC responders 
at Week 24 or had a dose increase between Weeks 13 and 24. 
Table 12 mUFC endpoints and average dose by treatment group, race and region (study C2301) 
Note - all Asian patients were treated at sites in Asia and the results by region and by race are therefore the same for Asian 
patients and patients at Asian sites; the number of “Black” and “Other” patients was small (n=4 and n=5, respectively) and 
those subgroup results should be interpreted with caution.

Design 
This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomised withdrawal study of 
osilodrostat following a 24 week, single-arm, open-label dose titration and 
treatment period. Eligible patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion 
at Week 26 at a 1:1 ratio either to continue treatment with osilodrostat at the 
same dose or to matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by osilodrostat 
dose at Week 24 (≤ 5mg bid vs. >5mg bid); and history of pituitary irradiation 
(yes/no).

Supportive studies 
Study C2201 
Study C2201 Part I was a 10-week exploratory proof-of-concept study with the last patient assessed on 
06-Mar-2012 (interim CSR: 07-Dec-2012). This sequential dose-escalation study assessed the short-term 
safety/tolerability and the efficacy of osilodrostat after a 10-week treatment period in patients with CD (Figure 
20). 12 patients were enrolled and treated with up-titrated doses of osilodrostat. All 12 patients completed the 
study. 
Study C2201 Part II Core was a 22-week treatment period after which the long-term efficacy and safety of 
osilodrostat were further investigated in an optional 48-week extension (Extension 1) (Figure 20). The extension 
phase was continued as Extension 2 to provide continued access to osilodrostat for patients who completed 
Extension 1. Efficacy results from the extended long-term phase of Part II Core are presented in this report. The 
study remains ongoing. 
A total of 19 patients were enrolled (4 patients from Part I in the Follow-up cohort and 15 newly enrolled patients 
in the Expansion cohort) between January and July of 2013. After Week 22, 16 patients entered the extension 
phase. Of the 16 patients that entered the extension phase, 10 are still ongoing as of the data cut-off date 
(14-Nov-2017). 
Figure 17 Study design – Study C2201 (following Protocol Amendment 4)
Study C1201 
Study C1201 is an ongoing Phase II, single-arm, open-label, dose-titration study to assess the 
safety/tolerability and efficacy of osilodrostat in 9 Japanese patients with endogenous CS except CD (hereafter 
referred to non-CD CS). 
The study consists of two distinct study periods plus an optional extension period. The study schematic is 
displayed in Figure 21. 
Study period I (12-week duration): the dose titration period achieved an individual stable therapeutic dose and 
assessed the efficacy and safety. 
Figure 18 Study design – Study C1201 
Study period II (36-week duration): assessed the sustainability of efficacy and the long-term safety for the 
patients who tolerated and who agreed to continue study treatment to derive further clinical benefit.

Optional extension period: ends after all patients have completed Week 72 or discontinued prior to Week 72. 
As of the data cut-off date (07-Jun-2018), all nine patients were treated with up-titrated doses of osilodrostat 
with seven (77.8%) of patients completing Period 1 (Week 12) of the study; two patients discontinued prior to 
Week 12. Four patients of the seven entered Period 2 of the study and, as of the data cut-off of 07-Jun-2018, 
two patients completed Period 2 (Week 48); one patient of the two entered the ongoing extension.

Study C2201 Part II Core, enrolled patients had persistent or recurrent hypercortisolism, including patients with 
de novo CD, after primary pituitary surgery and/or irradiation as well as patients with de novo CD who are not 
surgical candidates for medical reasons, or who refused to undergo surgery. At screening, patients had to have 
a mUFC > 1.5 x ULN (Table 23). More females than males were enrolled with a median age of 36 years. The 
majority of patients were Caucasian. 
In Study C1201, patients with non-CD CS were enrolled. All patients enrolled were Japanese and demographic 
characteristics were similar with those reported for C2201 Part II in that more females than males were enrolled. 
Patients in Study C1201 were slightly older with the median age of 46 years (Table 23). The BMI in patients was 
higher in Study C2201 Part II Core compared to Study C1201.

Disease history and baseline characteristics 
Study C2201 Part 2 
In Part 2 of the Core study (with a cut-off of 23-Dec-2013), the median time to first osilodrostat dose since initial 
CD diagnosis in the Expansion cohort was 63.4 months (range: 12.2 to 155.2) and 82.5 months (range: 57.6 to 
100.3) in the Follow-up cohort and all patients had persistent/recurrent CD. Overall the vast majority of patients 
had received prior treatment for CD prior to study entry, with 86.7% of patients in the Expansion cohort having 
had previously undergone pituitary surgery and all had received prior radiation treatment whereas all four 
patients in the Follow-up cohort had received prior treatment for CD prior to study entry and had previous 
pituitary surgery. The baseline median mUFC was 386.903 nmol/24h in the Expansion cohort and 454.933 
nmol/24h in the Follow-up cohort. 
As of the 14-Nov-2017 cut-off date, in the Safety set, the median time to first osilodrostat dose since initial CD 
diagnosis was 70.2 months (range: 12.2-155.2) and all patients had persistent/recurrent CD. Overall the vast 
majority of patients had received prior treatment for CD prior to study entry, with 89.5% of patients having had 
previously undergone pituitary surgery. The baseline mean (SD) mUFC was 1370.65 (2733.5). 
Study 1201 
Disease characteristics at baseline are described below: 
• 
• 
Five patients had adrenal adenoma and four had no prior surgery; one patient of the five had received prior 
medication. 
Three patients had ectopic corticotropin syndrome and only one had prior surgery; all had received prior 
medication. 
•  One patient had ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia with prior medication and no surgery. 
The five patients with prior medication were previously treated with metyrapone. 
Efficacy results 
Study C2201 Part 1 
At the time of the completed Part I of the 10-week core study, a notable decrease in UFC was seen after 28 days 
of dosing (when most subjects had completed dosing with 5 mg bid) and continued to decline to Day 70 when 
treatment stopped. The total daily dose required for UFC normalization was ≤20 mg/day in 75% of the patients, 
with at least 50% of the patients requiring 10-20 mg/day. 
Although mUFC levels increased again upon stopping osilodrostat at the end of the 10-week study, once 
treatment was resumed for patients who continued in Part II of the study, reduction in mUFC (≤ ULN) levels 
were achieved. While mean fold ULN declined to <1 (ULN) by Day 56, the mean time to response (UFC 
normalization or 50% reduction) was 34.3 days (SD = 14.1 days). 
Furthermore, nine patients of the 12 had three UFC measurements at both baseline and Week 10 (Day 70) and 
were therefore included in the primary analysis set. 
•  All nine patients were considered to be responders achieving either a mUFC ≤ ULN or ≥ 50% decrease in 
mUFC at Day 70, so the response rate was 100% (95% CI: 66%, 100%). 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 73/134 
  
  
  
 
 
•  All 9 patients met both responder criteria: the mean UFC level was ≤ ULN as defined by local laboratories 
(from the three 24-hour urine samples collected at Week 10) and represented a ≥ 50% decrease from 
baseline. 
The paired t-test comparing geometric means at Week 10 to baseline gave a ratio of 0.103, indicating an 
average of 90% reduction in UFC over the 10-week dosing period.

Study C2201 Part 2 
Changes in mUFC and responder status by UFC levels 
In Study C2201 Part II, mUFC levels (≤ ULN) were maintained without any consistent dose increase as 
evidenced by the total daily dose of osilodrostat with the range of doses consistent between 10 mg/day to 12 
mg/day and some patients had dose decreases. Reduction of mUFC≤ ULN with osilodrostat is evident by mUFC 
responses over time: 
• 
• 
• 
Part II Core (Week 10), the end of the dose titration period: An overall response rate of 89.5% (95% CI: 
66.86, 98.70) was achieved with 84.2% of patients (16/19) being complete responders and 5.3% (1/19) 
being partial responders. 
Part II (Week 22), the core phase: An overall response rate of 78.9% (95% CI: 54.43, 93.95) was achieved 
with 78.9% of patients (15/19) being complete responders; there were no partial responders. The response 
rate was maintained at Month 22 as evidenced by an overall response rate of 70.6% (95% CI: 44.0, 89.7) 
was achieved and 58.8% of patients (10/17) patients were complete responders and 11.8% (2/17) were 
partial responders. Response to osilodrostat was maintained through Month 46 with 58.8% (10/17) patients 
as complete responders. 
Part II (Week 22), the core phase: At the time of the last available assessment, an overall response rate of 
63.2% (95% CI: 38.36, 83.71) was achieved with 47.4% of patients (9/19) being complete responders and 
15.8% (3/19) being partial responders. 
The median mUFC level at baseline was 2.9xULN (404.97 nmol/24hr) and mUFC ≤ ULN is evident with 
osilodrostat at various time points throughout the study. mUFC levels during the study are as follows: 43.96 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 74/134 
  
  
  
 
 
nmol/24hr (95% CI for percentage change from baseline: -92.69, - 78.25) at the end of Week 10; 59.78 
nmol/24hr (95% CI for percentage change from baseline: -88.86, -71.71) at the end of Week 22; and 86.90 
nmol/24hr (95% CI for percentage change from baseline: -81.92, -52.33) at the time of the last available 
assessment. 
Escape analysis 
No escape event was reported during the 22-week period in Part 2 of the Core study. In both the Expansion and 
Follow-up cohorts, all patients attained UFC normalization and no patient lost UFC control (i.e. UFC >ULN) on at 
least 2 consecutive visits at the highest tolerated dose after previously attaining UFC normalization. 
Other assessments 
Cardiovascular-related metabolic parameters 
Decreases were observed in cholesterol and triglycerides whereas a small increase was observed in LDL 
cholesterol. Although a reduction in both SBP and DBP was observed at Week 70, this was not maintained at 
Month 58. A persistent decrease in BMI and FPG was observed up to Month 58. 
Study C1201 
Primary efficacy results 
In Study C1201, seven patients completed the study of the nine enrolled in Period 1 and all seven had reductions 
in mUFC with osilodrostat at Week 12. At Week-12, the median change in mUFC was: -98.97% (3/5 patients 
with prior metyrapone experience) vs -86.65% (4 patients without prior metyrapone experience), however due 
to small sample size the results should be interpreted with caution. Two patients discontinued prior to Week 12. 
The mean percent change from baseline at Week 12 ranged from -52.6% to -99.0%. 
Reduction in mUFC (≤ ULN) were evident based on the median percent change in mUFC from baseline as 
follows: Week 4, -83.3%; Week 8, -94.4%; and Week-12, -94.5%. The median decrease in mUFC from baseline 
at Week 12 was -94.47% (95% CI: 95% CI: -103.49%, -72.55%). 
At Week-24 (n=3), a 91.6% decrease from baseline in the mUFC levels was observed and the median mUFC was 
63.90 nmol/24 hr. At Week 48 (n=2), a 95.0% decrease from baseline in the mUFC levels was observed and the 
median mUFC was 511.30 nmol/24hr. The median decrease in mUFC from baseline at Week 48 (Day 337) was 
-95.0% (95% CI: -146.6, -43.5%). As the number of patients continuing the study after Week-12 was low (≤ 
3), the results at Week-24 and Week-48 should be interpreted with caution. 
Secondary efficacy results 
•  Response rates 
An overall response rate (i.e. mUFC <ULN or mUFC >ULN but with at least 50% reduction from baseline) of 
77.8% (7/9) was achieved in patients at Week 12 with 66.7% of patients (6/9) being complete responders and 
11.1% (1/9) being a partial responder; two patients discontinued the study prior to Week 12 and were counted 
as a non-responders. At Week 24, of the three patients still on study treatment, two patients were complete 
responders (66.7%) and one patient (33.3%) was a partial responder. At Week 48, with only two patients still 
on treatment, one patient was a complete responder and one patient was a partial responder. 
• 
Percentage change from baseline in Week-12 morning serum cortisol 
At baseline (N=9), the median morning serum cortisol level was 535.0 nmol/L (range: 309 to 1330). At Week 12 
(Day 85; n=7), and the median morning serum cortisol level was 235.0 nmol/L (range: 94 to 381 nmol/L) and 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 75/134 
  
  
  
 
the median percentage change of -56.07% (from baseline) was observed (range: -78.0% to -3.5%). Among the 
four patients who entered study Period II, three patients had assessments at Week 24. At Week 24 (Day 169; 
n=3), the median morning serum cortisol level was 257.0 nmol/L (range: 174 to 403 nmol/L) and the median 
percentage change of -68.96% (from baseline) was observed with the range of -69.7 to -43.7%. 
•  Cardiovascular-related metabolic parameters 
Improvements were observed in key cardiovascular-related metabolic parameters despite the limitations of a 
small number of patients and a short exposure to study drug. As the number of patients continuing the study 
after Week-12 was low (≤ 3), results should be interpreted with caution. 
• 
Patient-reported Outcomes 
Patient-reported outcome assessments based on Cushing QoL and BDI-II showed little to no improvement with 
scores at Week 12 that were similar to those reported at baseline. As the number of patients continuing the 
study after Week-12 was low (≤ 3), results should be interpreted with caution. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study program consists of one pivotal study, C2301, and two supportive studies, C2201 and C1201, and is 
considered adequate to support the proposed indication. The number of subjects with non-CD CS is however 
low. The design of the pivotal study is adequate and is in line with the CHMP scientific advice provided in 2013. 
No formal dose-response study was conducted. The starting dose was selected based on data from the initial 
studies in normo-cortisolaemic patients where a reduction in cortisol secretion was observed at a dose of 2 
mg/day. Although the modelling of PK exposure indicated that higher doses would be needed, other data 
showed a broad range inter-patient sensitivity to osilodrostat. Thus, the selection of a lower starting dose is 
justified. BID dosing was based on the half-life of osilodrostat. The maximum dose was reduced from the 
originally selected dose of 50 mg BID to 30 mg BID due to the observed risk of QT-prolongation. The uptitration 
scheme was partly designed to meet methodological restraints, where uptitration intervals were limited by the 
availability of central laboratory UFC values as the sample turnaround time was close to two weeks. 
The pivotal study (C2301) had a randomised withdrawal design. The study design included four treatment 
periods and the primary endpoint was evaluated in the third; randomised withdrawal period into which only 
complete responders on stable therapy were randomised. Generally, a randomised withdrawal design 
introduces an increased risk that subjects infer their own treatment assignment from disease symptoms and 
AEs. However, the primary effect measure (mUFC) is not likely to be affected by patient´s expectations in any 
clinically meaningful magnitude. 
The pivotal study provides information on the titration of osilodrostat as well as long-term efficacy data up to 
week 48. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate. The study allowed for patients with a 
history of pituitary irradiation, but at least 2 years (for stereotactic radiosurgery) or 3 years (for conventional 
radiation) should have elapsed from the time of last radiation treatment to the time of enrolment into this study. 
In previous CHMP advice, the CHMP agreed that irradiated subjects did not need to be excluded due to the 
usually slow onset of action. Notably, patients with risk factors for QT-prolongation were excluded from 
participation. Dose titration could continue throughout the study in case the patient showed insufficient 
response, however, only patients who had stabilised by week 12 were eligible for the RW period. Patients with 
UFC > 1.5 x ULN could discontinue treatment in the RW period and resume open-label osilodrostat.   
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 76/134 
  
  
  
 
The objectives, outcomes and endpoints are adequate. Validity and clinical relevance of the outcomes was 
already confirmed in former CHMP advice, both for the primary and secondary endpoints of number of 
responders (mUFC ≤ ULN) at 34 weeks and 24 weeks respectively. 
Also, the sample size calculation, randomisation procedures as well as blinding procedures were adequate. 
Taking into account the expected proportion of patients eligible for randomisation week 26 (at least 50%), a 
total of 132 patients were planned to be enrolled to have at least 33 patients per treatment arm in the 
randomised withdrawal period. Based on the number needed a power calculation was performed also for the key 
secondary endpoint. As mentioned before in CHMP advice, the potential radiation effect over an eight weeks 
period is considered of limited impact. Stratification according to previous pasireotide treatment was suggested 
in the same advice, but this was not followed. However, of the 22 patients with previous pasireotide treatment 
who were randomised, 13 were included in the osilodrostat treated group and 9 were treated with placebo. 
Additionally, 21 patients with previous pasireotide treatment were not randomised. Subgroup analyses did not 
indicate a different response in patients previously on pasireotide compared to the overall population. 
The primary effect analysis was performed on the Randomised Analysis Set. This set included patients that had 
mUFC <ULN at week 24, which restricts the patient population studied and enriches it with patients responding 
to treatment. Some patients with high baseline UFC were excluded from the randomised part of the study; 
although they experienced a clinically meaningful drop in UFC they did not fulfil the formal criteria. This means 
that effect estimates may not be applicable to the group that would be prescribed the drug in clinical practice. 
Also, there were 19 patients that withdrew before randomisation, 12 of these due to AES. Another concern in 
randomised withdrawal studies is withdrawal effects, which may lead to overestimated effect estimates. This 
may be the case here, due to increased ACTH and therefore, it could be argued that the key secondary endpoint 
is more appropriate than the primary endpoint in showing effect of osilodrostat. 
During the randomised study period only two patients discontinued the study. These patients were randomised 
to placebo and the reasons for discontinuation were classified as adverse events. These patients were counted 
as non-responders in the analysis, which may overestimate the treatment effect somewhat. However, none of 
these patients had initiated placebo treatment at discontinuation and the potential bias is not considered to be 
substantial in context of the observed treatment effect.  
The key secondary endpoint uses the Full Analysis Set, and this analysis uses data from the single arm open 
label periods initiating the study i.e. period 1; dose titration and period 2; efficacy and safety assessment at the 
therapeutic dose determined during the dose titration period. Such an analysis may be subject to bias due to 
regression to the mean and due to expectation of effect. A large placebo/expectation effect is not considered 
likely in this endpoint, but regression to the mean may be an issue since an inclusion criterion was to have mUFC 
>1.5×ULN, and since patients may be more motivated to enter the study when symptoms are severe. The 
observed effect may therefore be overestimated but is considered unlikely to be primarily driven by the 
methodological issues.    
The sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses planned and performed were sparse and what regards the 
sensitivity analyses considered not to be very challenging.  Given convincing outcomes and overall few study 
discontinuations no new analyses will be requested. The submitted version of the SAP (dated 06-Jul-2018) was 
dated after database lock (10-May-2018), but a detailed document history was provided, so this raises no 
concern about pre-specification of the analyses. 
In conclusion the statistical methodology in study 2301 were adequate but special care has to be taken in the 
interpretation of the efficacy results so that the effect estimates are interpreted in context of the randomised 
withdrawal study design.

Concerning the conduct of the study, there were four amendments out of which three occurred after the 
inclusion of the first patient. The applicant was asked to discuss how a rescue procedure, introduced in 
amendment 3, may have affected the interpretation of the results. The applicant explained that patients with 
UFC > 1.5 x ULN could discontinue treatment in the RW period and resume open-label osilodrostat, and that this 
procedure was introduced in the original protocol. Other amendments are not considered to affect the 
interpretation of the study results. 
It is agreed that the protocol deviations as reported in the CSR had no impact on the interpretation of the study, 
but the relatively high number of dosing and dispensing errors raise some concerns on the conduct of the study. 
Furthermore, serious concerns did arise from a GCP inspection about protocol deviations with respect to dose 
adjustments based on mUFC values and other changes to the IMP-regimen or temporarily complete interruption 
of IMP-dosing. The Applicant has provided information on the actions taken in relation to the deficiencies in GCP 
compliance. The deviations with regards to PD reporting were not considered to affect the outcome and 
interpretation of the study data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 202 patients were screened for the pivotal study C2301, of which 65 patients were screening failures. 
The number of enrolled patients was 137 which is close to what had been planned (i.e. 132). Overall, 25% of 
subjects discontinued at any time of the study, the most common reason for discontinuation was AEs. However, 
4 additional patients met discontinuation criteria but continued in the study, the discontinuation rate would then 
have increased to 28.5%. Five (5) percent of subjects withdrew at or before week 12. There was one death 
reported. All enrolled patients further received at least one dose of osilodrostat and were hence included in the 
Full Analysis Set. 
The study enrolled a population representative for the condition. Of note, the mean age was rather low (41 
years), ranging from 19 to 70 years. A number of patients had a baseline mUFC below 1.5 ULN. Inclusion was 
based on screening values and the Applicant has provided data supporting that the lower mUFC values at 
baseline can be explained by the known variability of the mUFC values in CD. 
Of the total number of patients enrolled 71/137 (51.8%) were randomised in Period 3, which is according to 
what had been expected at the planning stage (at least 50%). The primary analysis set for the analyses of the 
randomised withdrawal period was the RAS in which one patient randomised to placebo was excluded due to 
failing the criterion of having received at least one dose of randomised treatment.  
The primary endpoint was met as the proportion of patients who completed the randomised withdrawal period 
and maintained mUFC ≤ ULN was significantly higher in the osilodrostat treated group (86.1% vs 29.4%; OR 
13.71 [3.73, 53.44]). The high placebo response was explained by a too short placebo exposure period in some 
cases to lose biochemical control after prolonged steroidogenesis inhibition.  The outcome was supported by the 
sensitivity analyses. These data support the efficacy of osilodrostat, but the outcome does not provide a 
clinically meaningful measure of the effect size considering that only patients responding and on stable 
treatment were randomised. 
There was a rather rapid increase in mUFC two weeks after withdrawal in the placebo treated group, and the risk 
of losing control was substantially lower in the osilodrostat treated group. The median time to loss of control was 
28 days. In total 10 patients in the placebo treated group discontinued/received rescue therapy (open-label 
osilodrostat), whereas one patient in the osilodrostat treated group discontinued. Since a large proportion of 
patients in the placebo treated group discontinued placebo treatment already at week 26, the absolute 
difference in mUFC is difficult to interpret but the data supports the efficacy of osilodrostat. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 78/134 
  
  
  
 
The study also met its key secondary objective. The key secondary endpoint was responder rate at week 24, 
applying a strict definition of responders (i.e. with mUFC<ULN and without dose increase after week 12). 
Patients with missing data at week 24 were considered non-responders. With this definition, a response rate of 
52.6% (72/137) was observed; the 95% CI was (43.9, 61.1) and hence, the lower bound of the 95% CI was 
above the pre-specified threshold (i.e. ≥ 30%). If patients who had continued the titration in period 2 were 
included, the response rate increased to 67.9%. When applying this strict definition, the response rate is higher 
than observed for pasireotide (26.3 % in the 900 μg b.i.d. group at 6 Months; EPAR for Signifor). Comparisons 
with other cortisol synthesis blockers, e.g. ketoconazole, are difficult due to the nature of the data but responder 
rates appear to be comparable (EPAR for Ketoconazole HRA). 
Subgroup analyses were in general consistent with the overall outcome for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. With regards to the primary endpoint, the point estimate was above 0 for all groups, and CIs were 
very large due to the low numbers. With regards to the key secondary endpoint, the subgroup of Asian subjects 
showed a lower response rate. There was however no apparent difference in the outcome for Japanese or 
non-Japanese subjects. Only seven subjects aged 65 to 75 years were included in study C2301. The mUFC 
response rates tended to be lower and average daily doses tended to be higher in the non-randomized treatment 
group: this is programmed by study design as these patients were not mUFC responders at Week 24 or had a 
dose increase between Weeks 13 and 24. 
The proportion of responders was largely maintained from week 12 and up to week 48 with a slight decrease 
from 71.5% complete responders at week 12 compared to 66.4% complete responders at week 48. There was 
a trend towards a decrease in the proportion of partial responders in favour of complete responders over time. 
The number of patients without prior surgery was low (17) but there was no difference in the responder rate in 
this group compared to the overall population. When looking at individual data, all but one patient showed a 
decrease in mUFC.  
Non-randomised patients continued open-label osilodrostat treatment throughout the course of the study. The 
overall response rate in this group was somewhat lower than in the total population at week 24 (65.2% vs 
82.5%) and at week 48 (59.1% vs 75.9%). Thus, also in this population, potentially more difficult to treat, a 
clinically relevant proportion achieved normalisation of mUFC. 
In the exploratory PoC study C2201, all nine patients who had three UFC measurements both at baseline and 
week 10 were responders. During the washout period, UFC increased after stopping osilodrostat. The responder 
rates observed in the second part of study C2201, up to week 22, were in the same range (78.9%) as observed 
in the pivotal study. 
The data indicate that the effect is maintained over time in patients responding to treatment, with 64 patients 
showing maintained response 6 months after the initial normalisation of mUFC. In study C2301, “escape” was 
evaluated in patients who had achieved control of UFC. When applying the protocol definition of escape, the 
median (KM method) time to “escape” was 560 days.  
The supportive study C2201 was divided in two parts, of which the second part was a long-term extension to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of osilodrostat. Ten of the patients enrolled in Part II of the study are still 
ongoing and have thus been treated for more than 4 years. Data is available for 17 patients up to 46 months, at 
which time point 58.8% were still complete responders. 
In line with the data on mUFC, normalisation of plasma cortisol levels was observed after week 10 except for the 
placebo treated group during the RW period.

Hypercortisolism causes negative effects on both CV and metabolic risk factors as well as characteristic changes 
to the patient’s habitus. In study C2301, reductions were observed for all CV parameters included in the 
evaluation except for triglycerides. SBP and DBP decreased by 6.8 and 6.6%, respectively. Body weight 
decreased by 4.6%. An increase in BMD was observed, most prominent in the lumbar spine where a 3% increase 
in BMD was observed. There was a favourable shift with regards to features of CD as assessed from two 
photographs taken and reviewed locally by the Investigator. Improvements in QoL scores were also observed. 
In study C2201, some improvements were observed in CV related metabolic parameters such as cholesterol, 
triglycerides, FPG and BMI. There was an initial decrease in SBP and DBP which was not maintained at month 58. 
The second supportive study, C1201, was conducted in Japan and enrolled a small population of patients with CS 
other than CD. The uptitration schedule was similar to that applied in the pivotal study. Notably, only seven of 
the nine patients completed the 12 week uptitration period and only four patients entered the second period of 
the study. Only one patient entered the optional extension period. The data from this study, supporting the use 
of osilodrostat in patients with non-CD CS, is of importance as proof-of-concept. 
In study C1201, osilodrostat treatment resulted in a mean percent change in mUFC from baseline to week 12 
ranging from 52% to 99%. At week 24 the median mUFC in the median mUFC was well below ULN (63.9 
nmol/24 hr) but only three patients remained in the study. At week 48, the two remaining patients showed a 
95% decrease from baseline in mUFC levels, but the median mUFC was above ULN. The response rate in the first 
part of the study was comparable to that observed in the studies in patients with CD. Importantly, the two 
patients still on treatment at week 48 were still responding to treatment. Data on morning cortisol levels show 
a normalisation compared to baseline. There were some improvements in CV related metabolic parameters 
whereas no improvements were observed in the PROs. 
Thus, most patients in study C1201 showed a persistent response, whereas one patient with adrenal adenoma 
appears to have lost control at week 16. Further data on this patient has been provided and the apparent loss of 
control is related to discontinuation of treatment with osilodrostat.   
The limited data is considered sufficient to support the proposed target population of CS taking the mechanism 
of action for osilodrostat into account.  
Most patients had achieved ≤ ULN at week 16. The median time to response was 41 days, both in the total study 
population and in the non-randomised group. There was however a slight shift to the right in the curve for 
non-randomised patients, indicating longer time to response in this group compared to the total study 
population. Single patients reached controlled mUFC after about 4 months of treatment.  
The highest osilodrostat dose was observed at week 10, after which the mean dose decreased and stabilised at 
a mean dose of 10-11 mg daily. Dose decrease was presumably due to low mUFC values. In the study, dose 
increments were made in steps of 5 mg, in the SmPC a more precautious uptitration is proposed with increments 
of 1 to 2 mg instead of 5 mg as in the study. As explained by the Applicant, the uptitration scheme applied in the 
study was partly due to methodological restraints. As more frequent cortisol monitoring is feasible in clinical 
practice, smaller but more frequent dose increases than applied in the study can be made to achieve control 
while minimising the risk of hypocortisolism. Recommendation on how to uptitrate the dose, and how to monitor 
the patients, have been included in the SmPC. 
In the study, patients who were on medical treatment were eligible for inclusion after washout periods, which 
were adapted for the different medicinal products used and 74.5% of patients had been treated with other 
medication for CD prior to study entry. Switching from other products is likely and recommendations have been 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 80/134 
  
  
  
 
added in the SmPC to highlight that a washout period is needed if patients are switched from e.g. pasireotide or 
ketoconazole. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The data from the pivotal study show that osilodrostat is efficient in lowering the mUFC in patients with CD and 
that the effect is maintained up to at least 48 weeks without indications of “escape”. The response rate of about 
70% is considered clinically relevant. Secondary endpoints on CV related metabolic parameters, physical 
features of hypercortisolism and BMD indicate further beneficial effects of treatment. Limited long-term data 
indicate that the effect of osilodrostat can be maintained over time.  
The small study in non-CD CS provide support for the adequacy of extrapolating efficacy data from patients with 
CD to patients with non-CD CS, taking the knowledge on the mechanism of action into account. Thus, the overall 
data support the use of osilodrostat in the proposed target population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data presented are based primarily on the results from the pivotal study C2301 conducted in patients 
with Cushing disease (CD) due to ACTH producing pituitary adenoma and is supported by an additional study in 
CD (Study C2201). To support the proposed indication of endogenous Cushing Syndrome caused by diseases 
other than ACTH producing pituitary adenoma, data from the Japanese Study (C1201) has been submitted (see 
section 2.5.).  
Study C2108, performed in 24 healthy female receiving cortisol supplementation (30 mg for 12 days) conducted 
to study pharmacokinetics of use of oral contraceptive together with osilodrostat, was also submitted.  
The substance was initially developed for the treatment of hypertension and hyperaldosteronism. The clinical 
studies in these indications used lower doses (0.25 mg/day to 2 mg/per day) of osilodrostat used for shorter 
durations (4-8 weeks). Even though these studies are not included in the safety data set for use of osilodrostat 
in intended population, the Applicant has in short summarised and submitted safety data and experience from 
these studies (A2201, A2206, A2215 and A2216). In this AR, data from these studies have been referred to 
when applicable. The studies are described in more detail in section “Common adverse events in other 
indications”. 
Patient exposure 
Overall exposure 
Three studies (C2301, C2201 and C1201) were performed in subjects covering the intended population. Cut-off 
dates for study C2301 was 21-Feb-2018 (ongoing), 14-Nov-207 for study C2201 part II (ongoing), 
06-Mar-2012 for study C2201 Part 1 and 07-Jun-2018 for study C1201(ongoing). Median exposures in the 
pivotal study (C2301) were 74.7 weeks and overall, across studies the median lengths ranged from 80 days to 
226 weeks (Table 24).   
In total, 134 subjects have been treated with osilodrostat in more than 6 months and 107 subjects have been 
treated more than 12 months (study 2301 and 2201 part II).  At time of cut-off, 11 subjects had been treated 
for 48 months or more (all in study C2201 part II). Thus, long-term experience is limited however further 
long-term safety date is pending from all three studies performed in the intended population.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 81/134 
  
  
  
 
 
For study C2301 a safety update was submitted with a data cut-off date as of 15-Oct-2018. In this up-date the 
median (range) exposure to treatment was 104.1 weeks (range 0.9 to 199.0) weeks with some patients being 
treated for more than 192 weeks. One hundred and ten patients were exposed to osilodrostat for at least 156 
weeks. The additional median exposure compared to the primary cut-off date was approximately 30 weeks. 
The safety database is not representative for the full target population of endogenous CS as for the non-CD form 
of CS, only 9 patients were included (5 with adrenal adenoma, 3 with ectopic corticotropin syndrome and 1 with 
ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH)) which were all of Japanese origin, and of which 
only 4 patients continued after week 12 and only 2 completed the study period II at week 48.  
It is recognized that the number of non-CD CS patients is very limited and that the safety profile can be different 
in these patients but mainly due to AE related to the disease, its extent and complications.  
However, the study data in the non-CD CS patients, although very limited, in combination with an acceptable 
mechanistic reasoning and a high unmet medical need currently results in a positive benefit-risk analysis. To 
ensure this the safety data “Use in non-Cushing disease Cushing syndrome subjects including long-term effects” 
has been characterised as a population with missing information in the RMP.  
In addition, the Applicant should take any opportunity to gather extra information in the post-approval setting, 
once marketing authorisation is granted: this holds for both CD and non-CD CS patients and is outlined in the 
pharmacovigilance plan evaluation. 
Moreover, the CD population primarily consisted of second-line patients with persistent/recurrent disease after 
pituitary surgery. In total, only 17 subjects were “de novo treated patients” without any history of pituitary 
surgery (all in study C2301). Thus, safety data in the “de novo” patients is limited. A subgroup analyses 
comparing the subjects without previous pituitary surgery (“de novo”) and subjects with prior surgery did not 
raise any new safety concern for the “de novo” subjects. It is therefore considered acceptable to extrapolate 
safety information from the “prior surgery” to the subjects with “no prior surgery”. 
Among all subjects six subjects (all in study C2301) had not received any previous treatments for Cushing’s 
disease. 
In addition to data in subjects with Cushing syndrome, 520 subjects with hypertension have been exposed to 
osilodrostat in low dose 0.25 mg/day to 2 mg/per day) in the four Phase II hypertension short-term (4-8 weeks) 
studies (A2201, A2206, A2215 and A2216). These studies are described in section “Common adverse events in 
other indications”. 
Overall, the number of subjects treated in the intended population, endogenous Cushing´s syndrome in adults, 
is low (n=165).  However, considering the status of orphan drug and the fact that information regarding safety 
is available from the population with hypertension the size of the safety database, at present, seems sufficient.

Dosing 
In line with the recommendation in the SmPC, the pivotal study (C2301) and the two supportive studies (C2201 
and C1201) used an up-titration schema based on individual efficacy and tolerability.  
The mean average-maintained dose after up-titration ranged between 10 to 12 mg/day in study C2301 and 
C2201 but was lower in the Japanese subjects (3.5 mg/day). The usual maintenance dose (presented in the 
SmPC section 4.2) was calculated as Q1-Q3 was 4-14 mg/day in the pivotal study (Table 25). 
Although a wide range of doses of osilodrostat has been administered in the clinical studies (up to 100 mg/day 
in 1 patient) and the maximum dose is 30 mg bid, the doses used in the pivotal study were generally quite low. 
According to the SmPC the highest recommended dose is 30 mg twice daily (=60 mg). This recommendation is 
in line with the highest dose used in the clinical trials. In total a few subject (n=5) was treated with doses of 60 
mg osilodrostat at any time of the study. The first start date for this dose varied between Day 63-261. The 
subjects seemed stayed on this dose a sufficient time (11- 867 days) to consider that the treatment probably 
have been acceptable tolerated. No new safety concern was raised when safety for subjects on high doses of 
osilodrostat (> 20 mg b.i.d; n=25) was compared to subjects on lower doses (<20 mg b.i.d; n=137), 
respectively.

Common adverse events 
Adverse events by system organ class 
All subjects (100%) included in the studies experienced at least one AE. In the pivotal study (C2301) and the 
supportive study C2201 (part 2) AEs were most commonly reported within the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders 
(67% and 68% respectively), Infections and infestations (67% and 74%, respectively) and General disorders 
and administration site conditions (65% and 79%, respectively). The reported SOC pattern in study C1201 and 
C2201 (part 1) were in line with the most common SOCs reported in the safety set of subjects with CS (study 
C2301 and C2201 part 2) (Table 27).

A patient with multiple severity grades for a SOC is only counted under the maximum grade. For C2301, any events 
experienced by patient randomized to placebo while on placebo are not included in this analysis. 
Adverse events by system organ class regardless of study drug relationship (study C2301) were similar in the 
updated safety data set (cut-off 15 Oct 2019) as to those reported in the primary analysis with regard to the 
nature, severity and frequency of event. 
AEs over time 
The AE profile over time- derived from each of the three observation periods in the Core phase (week 1-12, week 
12-26 and >26 weeks). There was no trend of increasing AEs over time as treatment with osilodrostat 
proceeded (Table 28). However, it has to be noted that the observation periods have varied duration in the 
different studies (12 weeks, 14 weeks, and up to approximately 3 years, respectively).

Common adverse events by preferred term 
The overall most common AE was nausea experienced in 41%-58% among all studies. Headache and fatigue 
was also frequently reported both in study 2301 (34% and 28%) and part 2 of study C2201 (42% and 26%). 
Adrenal insufficiency was reported in 28-32% of the subjects (Table 29). In study C2201 (part 2), high blood 
corticotrophin levels were reported in 8/19 (42%) of the patients. As discussed by the Applicant the frequencies 
of individual AEs differ, sometimes a lot, between the two studies included in the safety set (study C2301 and 
C201 part 2). However, it is agreed that this could most probably be explained by the different duration of 
exposure between the two studies and the low number of subjects in study 2201. 
The AE profile in the placebo group during the randomised withdrawal phase in study 2301 demonstrates a 
slightly higher incidence of AEs for subjects in the osilodrostat group (72%) compared to the placebo group 
(66%). The most conspicuous differences between the two groups are a higher frequency of subjects reporting 
nausea in the osilodrostat treatment group (n=4/36) compared to the placebo group (n=0). An imbalance was 
also noted for arthralgia and headache with 3 cases reported in the osilodrostat group compared to none in the 
placebo group. Nausea and headache is listed in the proposed SmPC which is endorsed. However, arthralgia is 
by the Applicant considered reflecting a complication of the underlying chronic hypocortisolism. This is accepted.

A patient with multiple severity grades for an AE is only counted under the maximum grade. For C2301, any event experienced 
by patients randomized to placebo while on placebo are not included in this analysis.  
AEs reported in the safety update (study C2301) with cut-off 15 Oct 2018 were similar to those reported in the 
primary analysis with regard to the nature, severity and frequency of events. 
Common AEs with osilodrostat in other indications (i.e. hypertension) 
Osilodrostat was previously studied in patients with hypertension. The clinical studies in this indication used low 
doses (0.25 mg/day to 2 mg/per day) for shorter durations (4 to 8 weeks). Overall, besides in general lower 
frequencies of reported AEs, no new safety finding have been identified regarding the AE profile when comparing 
treatment with low-dose osilodrostat in subjects with hypertension with higher doses in the subjects with 
endogenous Cushing syndrome (Table 30).

Study A2201 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, parallel group, dose 
finding (0.25 mg QD, 0.5 mg QD, 1.0 mg QD and 0.5 mg BID) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
osilodrostat compared to placebo after 8 weeks treatment in patients with stage 1-2 hypertension (N=524 
including 77 in the placebo group and 84 in active substance group [eplerenone]). Most frequent AEs (>1%) 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 89/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
among patients receiving osilodrostat were nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, influenza, upper respiratory 
tract infection and fatigue. 
A2206 
A pilot, single-blind, forced-titration study to assess the hemodynamic and hormonal effects, safety and 
tolerability of osilodrostat after 4 weeks of treatment in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (N=18). All 
patients received 0.5 mg b.i.d for 2 weeks, followed by 1 mg b.i.d for 2 weeks. Most frequent AEs among 
patients receiving osilodrostat were hypertension, diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis and myodesopia (all 1 patient 
each). 
A2215 
A Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the effects of 
osilodrostat (0.5-2.0 mg once daily) on cortisol after 6 weeks of treatment in patients with hypertension (N=63 
including 13 subjects on placebo). Most frequent AEs among patients receiving osilodrostat (>2%) were: 
headache, ACTH stimulation test abnormal, dizziness, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, hyponatremia, nausea, sinusitis, 
arthritis, back pain, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, chest discomfort, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, 
vomiting. 
A2216 
A Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the effects of 
osilodrostat (0.25mg BID, 1.0 mg QD, and 0.5mg BID titrated to 1.0mg BID after 4 weeks of treatment) on 
cortisol after 6 weeks of treatment in patients with hypertension (N=155 including 33 subjects in the placebo 
group and 33 in the active control group [eplerenone]). Most frequent AEs >2% were: hyponatremia (including 
blood sodium decreased), blood cortisol decreased, diarrhea, muscle spasms, nausea, upper abdominal pain, 
increased blood creatinine, increased blood glucose, dizziness, dyspepsia, fatigue, headache, hyperhidrosis, and 
peripheral edema. 
Adverse events suspected to be drug related 
Overall, 93-95% of the subjects in study C2301 and Study C2201 Part 2 (CS) experienced AE that was judged 
as related to study drug by the investigators. Of these, 30-40% was a grade 3 or 4 AE. The most common PTs 
judged as related to study drug was adrenal insufficiency and nausea (37/137 [27%] and 6/16 [32%] in study 
C2301 and C2291 respectively) and fatigue (29/137 [21%] and 4/19 [21%]).   
Adverse events leading to dose interruption or adjustment 
Overall, the vast majority of subjects (78%) in the pivotal study (C2301) experienced at least one AE that lead 
to a dose interruption or adjustment. Most commonly (>6% of patients) reported AEs requiring dose adjustment 
of interruption regardless of study drug relationship were adrenal insufficiency (25%), glucocorticoid deficiency 
(18%), nausea (15%), fatigue (12%) and asthenia (9.5%).  
Adverse events of special interest 
The AESI considered by the Applicant for osilodrostat are: 
•  hypocortisolism-related AEs  
• 
adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs  
•  pituitary tumor enlargement-related AEs 
•  QT-prolongation-related AEs

Hypocortisolism-related AEs  
Symptoms (e.g. nausea, fatigue and dizziness) and clinical manifestations (e.g. hypotension, hypoglycaemia, 
hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia) related to decreased cortisol is expected based on the mechanism of action 
of osilodrostat. If untreated, hypocortisolism could lead to fatal outcomes (like Addison crisis). However, if early 
detected this condition is manageable.  
The following PTs were used to identify hypocortisolism related Adverse events; Addison's disease, Adrenal 
insufficiency, Adrenal suppression, Adrenocortical insufficiency acute, Cortisol decreased, Cortisol deficiency, 
Cortisol free urine decreased, Glucocorticoid deficiency, Glucocorticoids decreased, Primary adrenal 
insufficiency, Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency and Steroid withdrawal syndrome. The initially identified 
hypocortisolism related Adverse events were not checked for related laboratory values (i.e. cortisol levels).

Page 91/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Study C2301 
•  Adverse events related to hypocortisolism irrespective of laboratory values 
In an up-dated analyse the Applicant concludes that 71/137 patients (52%) reported 167 AEs related to 
hypocortisolism in study C2301 (see search criteria above). The most reported PT was adrenal insufficiency, 
reported in 28% (n=38) (Table 33). 
One third (56/167; 33%) of the hypocortisolism related adverse events occurred within the titration period i.e. 
first 12 weeks (84 days). The remaining events (67%) occurred after the first 12 weeks (Table 34). However, in 
individual cases up-titration occurred even after the first 12 weeks and overall 40% (67/167) of the reported 
adverse events related to hypocortisolism occurred during any period of up-titration and 57% (96/167) of the 
reported events occurred during periods with stable doses of osilodrostat. Among the in total 96 events reported 
during maintenance periods 15% were reported with confounding factors. 
Most of the patient with hypocortisolism-related AEs had just one episode. 
Among the 70 patients initially identified with a hypocortisolism-related event (in study C2301), 39 had dose 
reductions. Most patients (25/39) had 1 dose reduction. Dose interruptions occurred in 30 of the 70 patients, in 
most cases, one instance of dose interruption (23). Four patients (2.9%) with adrenal insufficiency AEs 
discontinued the study drug. 
•  Adverse event related to hypocortisolism vs laboratory values  
In study C2301 laboratory values were identified in 64 of the 67 events reported during any period of titration. 
Among these only 27% (17/64) were reported cortisol values below the normal lower level. Thus in 73% of the 
cases (47/64) the events seem to have been reported with values within the normal range (or above normal). 
Based on this finding the Applicant presented a deeper analyse of the hypocortisolism related AEs (during 
titration) in relation to mUFC levels. Thus, it could be concluded that there is an incoherence between the PT 
reported and the factual mUCF levels. Based on this observation the Applicant assume that the frequency of true 
hypocortisolism in C2301 study may have been be over-estimated because of misclassification of the AEs. The 
assumption is based on the following: 
The symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (sometimes just fatigue or malaise) with normal or even high 
mUFC were reported as hypocortisolism or adrenal insufficiency (sometimes specified as “suspected”, “relative”, 
“mild”, “acute”, “symptomatic”) and coded into obligatory PTs of “glucocorticoid deficiency” or “adrenal 
insufficiency”. The most appropriate term for these events associated with mUFC > ULN or in the upper part of 
the normal range would be “glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome”, as the reported symptoms were probably 
caused by a fast decrease in cortisol levels from the pre-treatment baseline. 
According to the Applicant, investigators may not have considered this term in some cases because 
“glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome” is not a usual term used in clinical endocrinology practice. 
However, it is of importance to also consider that the incoherence between the AEs and factual laboratory values 
might to some extent reflect the experience of a reduction in cortisol from high to normal levels. Therefore, when 
subjective symptoms of hypocortisolism appear, it is of importance to confirm these events by laboratory 
values. This is reflected in the SmPC.  
No values of cortisol levels in connections to the events during the maintenance periods have been presented by 
the Applicant. However, it could be assumed that even events, reported during the maintenance period, to some 
extent not either are associated with true hypocortisolism due to misclassifications by the investigators. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 92/134 
  
  
  
 
Study C2201 
In study C2201 (part II) 8 out of 19 subjects (42%) reported an event of hypocortisolism. As for study C2301 
the most reported PT was adrenal insufficiency, reported in 32% (n=6/19). Four of the six patients experienced 
one event each, and the other two patients experienced two events each. The adrenal insufficiency event in one 
patient was reported as an SAE. All events were suspected to be related to study drug by the Investigator.  
Summary of adverse events related to hypocortisolism 
There is an incoherence between adverse events related to hypocortisolism and laboratory values. The reason 
for this is probably a misclassification of the AEs by the investigators but also the fact that the subjects 
sometimes experience subjective symptoms when the cortisol levels decreases from high to normal levels. 
However, it could be concluded that the frequency of “true” hypocortisolism events seems lower than initially 
reported. This is reassuring. However, it is a weakness with the study that the factual frequency of 
hypocortisolism not is possible to estimate in the data presented. This depends on different factors; ambiguity 
regarding the description of AEs (GCP finding) and uncertainty in laboratory values due to different measuring 
methods. Furthermore, the recommended dosing in the proposed SmPC differs from that used in the studies. 
Thus, further analyses of the study data is not considered to change the B/R balance or result in major SmPC 
changes.  
Hypocortisolism is characterised as an important identified risk in the RMP. In addition, the Applicant has 
proposed a targeted follow-up questionnaire (including laboratory values) to follow events of hypocortisolism in 
routine pharmacovigilance. Events related to hypocortisolism will also be studied as a topic related to long-term 
safety.  
The overall risk for hypocortisolism is currently reflected in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8. In section 4.8 Adrenal 
insufficiency (including clinically similar PTs) is labelled as very common.  Hypotension could be a symptom 
related to hypocortisolism and this ADR is reflected in SmPC section 4.8. In order to avoid overtreatment and 
non-recognition of hypocortisolism, a recommendation for the use of specific laboratory methods for cortisol 
monitoring without significant cross-reactivity with cortisol precursors is given in the SmPC to avoid cortisol 
overestimation.  
It is agreed with the Applicant that the new data presented do not warrant any extended up-date of the PI and 
proposed pharmacovigilance and RMM activities are considering sufficient.

Figure 20 Time to first occurrence of hypocortisolism related adverse events (C2301) 
Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs  
Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation is a result of the mechanism of action of most cortisol inhibitors 
resulting in potential increase in circulating levels of cortisol and aldosterone precursors (11- deoxycortisol, 
11-deoxycorticosterone), and sexual steroids. 
In total, adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs was reported in 58/137 (42%) in study C2301 
and 12/19 (63%) in study C2201 part 2. The most common reported PTs were hypokalaemia (13% [2301] and 
10% [2201]), hypertension (12% [2301] and 21% [2201]) and acne (9% [2301] and 16% [2201]).  Most of the 
cases with hypertension reported severe/grade 3 events (Table 35). 
See also section “Laboratory findings” regarding measurements of sexual hormones. 
The Applicant has proposed to label most of the common adverse reactions related to adrenal hormone 
precursor accumulation in SmPC section 4.8 (i.e. hypokalaemia, acne, hirsutism and oedema).  
However, “hypertension” is not proposed in the ADR table. In response to the D120 LoQ the Applicant informs 
that in total there were 23 patients who experienced hypertension (including PTs of Hypertension, Renovascular 
hypertension, Blood pressure increased, Blood pressure systolic increased, Blood pressure diastolic increased; 3 
patients reported more than 1 event PT) in study C2301 and a further 5 patients in C2201. No patients in C1201 
reported an AE of hypertension. Thus, in total 28 subjects reported hypertension. A review of the cases 
concluded that all were confounded by underlying Cushing’s disease and associated comorbidities (including 
hypertension) and that there was no evidence of dose response or consistent temporal relationship, and the 
sporadic findings of hypertension were not consistent with the overall higher rates of hypotension and the 
effects on blood pressure seen in both the Cushing’s and hypertension programs. Overall, it was concluded that 
there was no robust evidence that the onset of worsening or new onset hypertension was associated with 
increases in 11-DOC that warranted any up-date of the SmPC.

Pituitary tumour enlargement-related AEs  
Tumour volume increase is a potential risk due to a lowering of blood cortisol and a negative feed-back leading 
to a potential increased ACTH production but may also be part of the natural history of the disease. Pituitary 
tumour enlargement could compress the surrounding tissues and cause vision problems.  
The size of the pituitary tumour was measured in study C2301. At baseline the median (min-max) tumour 
volume was 78.2 (4.6-6405.8) mm3, after 24 weeks the median size had decreased to 71.1 (5.0-1556.2) mm3 
and after 48 weeks to 70.7 (5.6-919.3) mm3. 
Overall, an enlargement of the pituitary tumour ≥ 20% (by region of interest) from baseline was noticed in 45% 
(36/79) of the subjects with both a baseline and post baseline value. Tumour volume decrease (≥20%) from 
baseline was observed in 61% (48/79) of these patients.   
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 96/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
In addition, a search was performed with the pre-defined search criteria for the AESI category of pituitary 
tumour enlargement AEs including the following preferred terms: 
•  Cavernous sinus syndrome 
•  Diplopia 
• 
• 
• 
Extraocular muscle paresis 
Pituitary enlargement 
Pituitary infarction 
•  Visual field defect 
The search identified three cases of diplopia. An additional search was conducted to include also non-serious 
events of pituitary tumour and pituitary tumour benign in C2301 to 15Oct2018. In total, 16 patients (including 
the 7 serious reports tabulated above) reported these events. In all cases, the event reflected growth of the 
underlying pituitary adenoma as evidenced by the reported term and/or tumour volume by ROI on MRI. 
Although, a decrease in mean tumour volume was reported in study C2301 an individual enlargement of the 
pituitary tumour ≥ 20% (in tumour volume by 3 maximum dimensions (mm3) or 2mm increase in longest 
diameter from baseline) was noticed in 44% of the subjects and a decrease in 56% of the subjects. It is agreed 
with the Applicant that overall, there was no evidence of tumour enlargement in association with use of 
osilodrostat. However, due to the mechanism of action (with increased ACTH production due to a negative 
feed-back of low cortisol levels) an increase in tumour volume could not be excluded in individual cases. Regular 
MRI monitoring of the adenoma to detect growth of the pituitary tumour should (always) be performed in clinical 
practice. Therefore, it is not considered relevant to up-date the SmPC with a warning regarding this. 
The pivotal Phase III study CLCI699C2301 was amended (Amendment 5) on 29-Jun-2018 to implement a 
number of changes to the protocol. One of these was to add two features to the central Pituitary MRI/CT 
assessments (corticotroph tumour re-occurrence and corticotroph tumour invasiveness.  
Corticotroph tumour re-occurrence: Among the 46 subjects without measurable pituitary tumour at baseline 
one subject with a re-occurrence of the corticotroph tumour was identified. This case had previously undergone 
pituitary surgery twice (latest in 2007). The re-occurrence was not associated with any AE in this case.   
New corticotroph tumour invasiveness: Among the 46 subjects with non-invasive pituitary tumours at baseline 
a “new” corticotroph tumour invasiveness was reached by 6 subjects.  In all the six cases a tumour volume 
increase was documented. Further, adverse events related to tumour volume increase were reported during the 
study in five of the six cases and all these five cases either discontinued study drug or was withdrawn from the 
study, which is considered relevant.   
in the individual cases it is difficult to assess if an enlargement of the pituitary tumour is only due to the disease 
(CD) or might have been enhanced by osilodrostat treatment. However, in subjects reaching tumour 
invasiveness when not showing tumour invasiveness before start of treatment it would be unfortunate, should 
osilodrostat treatment enhance tumour growth. Therefore, it would be of value to inform the prescriber that 
treatment with osilodrostat should be discontinued in case of a tumour enlargement reaching the degree of 
invasiveness in subjects without invasiveness before treatment. This information is now included in SmPC 
section 4.4 and the PL. 
Arrhythmogenic potential AEs 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 97/134 
  
  
  
 
Preclinical studies have shown a proarrhythmic potential for osilodrostat. The following PTs was included in the 
MedDRA search for AESI Arrhythmogenic potential AEs: Cardiac arrest, Cardiac death, Cardiac fibrillation, 
Cardio-respiratory arrest, Loss of consciousness, Sudden cardiac death, Sudden death, Syncope, Torsade de 
pointes, Ventricular arrhythmia, Ventricular fibrillation, Ventricular flutter, Ventricular tachyarrhythmia and 
Ventricular tachycardia. QT-prolongation is separately characterized as Adverse Event of Special Interest. See 
section below.  
According to the Applicant the search of events related to arrythmia described above identified one patient had 
a SAE of grade 3 syncope in study C2301 and one patient experienced two grade 2 events of syncope in study 
C2201. Neither of these events were reported in association with arrhythmia.  
However, in study C2301 additional events considered related to Arrhythmogenic potential are noted to have 
been reported (Table 14.3.1-1.4; CLCI699C2301 Primary CSR). In this table a total of 22 (16%) events in the 
SOC Cardiac disorders was reported including 7 cases reported “tachycardia”, 3 cases reported “palpitations”, 2 
cases reported “Bundle branch block right” and one each of the following PTs: “atrial fibrillation”, “AV-block 1”, 
“bradycardia2, “Bundle branch block left”, “sinus bradycardia”, “sinus tachycardia” and “Ventricular 
extrasystoles”. Reassuring, none of these events were reported as grade 3 or 4 and the most common PT of 
these, “tachycardia”, is included in the ADR table in SmPC section 4.8. However, they are AEs potential related 
to arrhythmia that also preferable should have been reflected in this section. At present since osilodrostat are 
known to a have a proarrhythmogenic potential and the that risk for QT-prolongations have strict SmPC 
wordings in section 4.4 it is not considered that any additional analyses of ECGs should provide any further 
information that should influence B/R or major SmPC writings. The risk is considered acceptable taken care of in 
the SmPC.  
QT-prolongation AEs 
In both human and animal studies, osilodrostat showed concentration/dose dependent QT prolongation and a 
potential to cause cardiac rhythm abnormalities, including Torsades de pointes. Due to substantial QTcF changes 
observed in a post-hoc analysis of a Phase I study, the maximum dose was decreased from 50 mg bid to 30 bid 
as a precaution. 
The mechanism by which osilodrostat may cause QT-prolongation is not well understood:  it does not seem to be 
through hERG or other cardiac ion channels, but a hypothetical mechanism is through an effect on intracellular 
calcium transients, energy and/or mitochondrial function.  
Hypokalaemia seen in CS is often associated with hypomagnesaemia and increases the risk of malignant 
ventricular arrhythmias. Worsening of hypokalaemia has been reported with adrenal directed drugs that can 
increase cortisol precursors with mineralocorticoid activity. In addition, myocardial fibrosis caused by an 
enhanced responsiveness to angiotensin II and activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor in direct response to 
cortisol excess could exacerbate the effects of hypokalaemia on QT interval prolongation seen in patients with 
CS. 
In all three studies (C2301, C2201 and C1201) subjects with risk factors for QTc prolongation or Torsade de 
Pointes including deranged electrolyte values (potassium, sodium or magnesium) were exclusion criteria as well 
as patients who had a history of CV diseases.  
In the dossier submitted there were differences between the SCS, the CSRs and the RMP, and issues lacking, in 
the number of events/ECG measurements and the information on dose-dependency. During the procedure, 
more information was requested from the applicant, and based partially on that as well as on CHMP’s analysis a 
compilation with the most up-to-date numbers seemed to be as summarised in Table 28 (below):

The amount of subjects with measured clinically significant QT-prolongations in study C2301, C2201 and C1201 
is considered low.  Considering a small population where the majority of individuals with risk factors have been 
excluded it is not expected to identify (m)any patients with serious events of arrhythmia including Torsade de 
pointes during the relatively short treatment period. In study C2301 the mean (SD) change from baseline at 
Week 48 was 5.3 ms (20.67) for QTcF. In total three subjects had QTcF values >480 to 500 ms (one in each 
study, based on central reading). No new QTcF of > 500 ms confirmed by central reading was observed in any 
of the studies, while one based on local reading was reported in C2301.  
In total, there were 7 subjects QT-prolonged AEs reported in the three studies, five (non-serious) in the pivotal 
study (C2301) and 2 (of which 1 serious) in study C2201. Considering a small population where the majority of 
individuals with risk factors have been excluded it is not expected to identify (m)any patients with serious events 
of arrhythmia including Torsade de pointes during the relatively short treatment period. 
The Applicant has confirmed that not all ECG measurements of clinical relevance (QTcF >480 ms, >500 ms and 
increase versus baseline >60 ms) were reported as ECG QT prolonged AE in the 3 studies i.e. the following were 
not reported: 5 patients, and a first finding in a 6th patient for whom a second finding was reported as an AE), 
without explaining why. While this is considered to be in contradiction to the protocol, no further action is 
possible at this stage.  
The risk for arrhythmia including QT-prolongations potentially leading to Torsade de pointes can occur at any 
treatment duration. 
The requested analysis, of the cases was not able to identify unknown risk factors/contributing factors nor a 
specific pattern regarding time-to-onset, duration, dosing phase or dose, so no further SmPC updates were 
considered relevant. Addition of a warning regarding the concomitant use of QT-prolonging medicinal products 
is included in the SmPC, section 4.5, and section 4.4 has been adequately up-dated regarding risk patients. 
Only 1 patient discontinued the study drug in C2301 due to ECG QT QT prolonged AEs and none in the other 
studies. None of the 8 patients with a > 60 ms increase versus baseline (local reading) was discontinued from 
the studies. For study C2201, this was not a discontinuation criterion; for C1201 and C2301, it depended on 
cardiologist review.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 99/134 
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
Nine of the events did not require any action towards osilodrostat, while for 4 events, osilodrostat was 
temporarily interrupted and re-initiated at the same dose (in 1 patient) or at reduced dose (in 3 patients) after 
which no new QT event was reported; 1 event required permanent discontinuation.  
The risk for QT-prolongations is reflected in SmPC section 4.4 with recommendations for ECG monitoring before 
and one week after initiation of osilodrostat and when clinically indicated thereafter, and electrolyte monitoring 
before and periodically during treatment, as well as in section 4.8. It was judged not possible to predict a time 
period where monitoring of electrolytes or ECGs should be specifically focused, and conversely intense 
monitoring throughout the lifetime of each patient is likely to result in undue burden. In case the QTc interval 
exceeds 480 ms prior or during treatment, cardiology consultation is recommended to consider whether to 
initiate or to continue osilodrostat, or (temporarily) reduce or interrupt its dose. 
The uncertainty regarding patients at risk for QT-prolongation and CV diseases remains as these were not 
included in the studies. It was asked to propose strengthened RMM for this population including a 
contraindication and updated warning in the SmPC. Taking into account the inherent risk of QT prolongation in 
CS, the quite large safety margin measured in the TQT study, the limited number of AEs and clinically significant 
ECG findings in the phase III studies, as well as the fact that it would be inappropriate to formally exclude all of 
these patients from osilodrostat treatment as there are only limited treatment options and the fact that it is 
hypothesised that the improvement of hypercortisolism with osilodrostat will reduce the inherent risk of QT 
prolongation, it is agreed with the Applicant not to add a contra-indication. However, these high-risk patients 
have been excluded from clinical studies, so some of the above stated elements are still theoretical and 
therefore, a warning in section 4.4 was added regarding the fact that the B/R should be carefully weighed in 
high-risk patients. 
The risk is characterized as an important identified risk in the RMP with routine PhV activities including a 
targeted follow-up check list and routine RMM. More results regarding cardiac safety after long-term use of 
osilodrostat will be available by the ongoing extension of the studies (C2301, C2201 and C1201). 
In addition, the risk for QT-prolongation in a real-world population after long-term use and in the population with 
CV diseases and risk for QT-prolongations will be followed within the topic “Long-term safety” characterised as 
missing information in the RMP which will be followed up in the Category 3 PASS studies. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Death 
Within all studies, one death (suicide) was reported (study C2301). The patient, a 55-year-old female, 
committed suicide during the Extension Period on Day 551.  The patient’s active medical conditions included 
depression, grade 2, since 2010. It is agreed with the Applicant that most probably the fatal case was due to a 
medical history of depression. However, a worsening of symptoms related to depression while on treatment 
could not be excluded. 
In total, events of depression were reported in 10 cases (7.3%) of the subjects in study C2301 and 3 subjects 
(16%) in study C2201. In total, one event of depression was reported as serious.  
In the safety up-date (cut-off date 15 Oct 2018) no additional deaths occurred until the database lock for the 
safety update but one additional death was reported after the database lock (Fatal viral gastroenteritis and 
cardiopulmonary failure; assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator). 
Other serious adverse events 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 100/134 
  
  
  
 
In the studies performed in subjects with Cushing disease (C2301 and C2201 part II) approximately one third of 
the subjects experienced a SAE, 36% (50/137) in study C2301 and 32% (6/19) in study C2201 part II. 
In study C2301, the most common SAEs were adrenal insufficiency or adrenocortical insufficiency acute (11/50 
cases; 22%) and pituitary tumour or pituitary tumour benign (7/50 cases; 14%) respectively (Table 37), see 
also section “Pituitary tumour enlargement-related AEs” above.

For C2301, any events experienced by patients randomized to placebo while on placebo are not included in this analysis. 
In the safety up-date, with cut-off 15 Oct 2018, there are 2 additional patients with the first occurrence of a SAE 
after the primary CSR cut-off date, 7 other patients also reported a SAE but had already reported another one 
in the primary analysis period. Thus, the number of patients that reported a SAE has increased from 50 to 52, 
and the number of those in whom they were considered drug-related has increased from 21 to 22. 
The nature and frequency of SAEs in the safety up-date with cut-off 15 Oct 2018, was similar to those reported 
in the primary CSR.

Laboratory findings 
The Applicant informs that laboratory analysis included evaluations of shift tables, worst post-baseline grade, 
Grade 3 or 4 lab abnormalities as well as laboratory abnormalities that were considered clinically relevant 
(reported as AEs).  
The analyse below focus on study C2301 since a low number of subjects were included in study C2201 and 
C1201. 
Haematology 
At the time of the data cut-off date, no patients had newly occurring grade 4 haematology abnormalities or 
worsening haematology abnormalities to grade 4. Newly occurring or worsening to grade 3 haematology 
abnormalities were infrequent and were reported for haemoglobin decrease and absolute neutrophils decrease 
(in 3 patients, each) and leucocyte increase and platelets decrease (in 1 patient, each). 
Haemoglobin decreases 
Anaemia/haemoglobin decreased is a known effect of related to the intended normalisation of chronic cortisol 
excess, has been documented with other therapies (including surgical treatment), and is not considered a direct 
toxic effect of the drug. 
In total, a decrease in haemoglobin (CTC grade 1-3) was reported in 38% of the patients in the pivotal study 
(C2301). including three cases of newly occurring or worsening to grade 3 The mean Hb value slightly decreased 
over time (137±18.03 g/L at baseline compared to 132.2±16.68 g/L after 12 weeks, 129.5±17.39g/L after 26 
weeks and 133.0±16.94 g/L after 44 weeks). 
In parallel, anaemia/iron deficiency anaemia/haemoglobin decreased was reported as an AE in 18/137 (13%) 
patients in C2301 as of 15-Oct-2018, in 5/19 (26%) patients in C2201 (as of 14-Nov-2017), and one patient in 
C1201. Across the 4 hypertension studies, there was a single case of non-serious ‘mild anaemia’ reported. Most 
of the relevant cases reported with anaemia had confounding factors of which several were present already at 
baseline, 
Since it is acknowledged that normalisation of chronic cortisol excess in subjects with CS is associated with a 
decrease haemoglobin, that the mean Hb value in study C2301 had a modest decreased over time and that a 
substantial amount of the cases with anaemia were confounded and in study C2301 it is acknowledged that no 
up-date of the SmPC is warranted. 
Neutrophil decrease 
Treatment with osilodrostat can potentially be associated with neutropenia which is considered to be an indirect 
effect of cortisol reduction, regardless of the treatment. In study C2301, a grade 3 absolute neutrophils 
decrease was noted in 3 subjects (including one SAE). In addition, grade 1-2 decreased was noted in 15/137 
subjects (11%). In the cases observed, neutropenia rapidly was reversed with interruption of osilodrostat, and 
reversed when osilodrostat was continued, typically with decreasing doses. According to information in the SCS, 
osilodrostat was dos adjusted, interrupt or discontinued due to AEs of the PT neutrophil decrease. It is, in clinical 
practice, of importance to consider that a decrease of neutrophils is a “natural” reaction to treatment reducing 
cortisol levels and that a decrease in neutrophils per see not should lead to a reduced dose or interruption of 
osilodrostat unless there is a risk for an associated AE or SAE.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 102/134 
  
  
  
 
However, due to the limited number of subjects with severe (grade 3) or serious cases it is considered 
acceptable to conclude that the findings regarding neutrophil decrease did not warrant any changes to the 
proposed SmPC. 
Basophile increase 
The Applicant describes that relatively high mean changes were observed for basophils with a highest mean 
change from baseline of 130%.  An explanation given by the Applicant is that this phenomenon may be due to 
an “immune rebound” often seen after disease remission in Cushing Syndrome. 
Clinical chemistry  
Overall, biochemistry laboratory values including the pattern of newly occurring or worsening abnormalities in 
study C2201 part 2 were in line with the results in study C2301 and did not warrant any further safety issues.  
In study C2301 newly occurring or worsening biochemistry abnormalities to grade 3 or 4 were reported for:  
Hypokalaemia  
Hypokalaemia is a comorbidity of Cushing Disease but also considered as adrenal hormone precursor 
accumulation potentially related AEs and included in the ADR table in SmPC section 4.8 as very common. 
In total low potassium values were reported in 32/137(23%) of which 9 reported newly occurring or worsening 
abnormalities grade 3 (8 subjects) or 4 (one subject).  
Hyperkalaemia   
Hyperkalaemia could be a direct effect of osilodrostat due to accumulation of mineralocorticoid precursors and 
is included as a symptom of hypocortisolism. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Hyperkalaemia was reported in total in 16/137(12%) of the subjects of which 3 reported newly occurring or 
worsening abnormalities grade 3. In total, three AEs (all non-serious) of hyperkalaemia were reported in Study 
C2301 and one in Study C2201. Three of the four patients were taking concomitant spironolactone, with 
additional antihypertensive agents throughout the study, the fourth patient had a first episode after more than 
2 years of osilodrostat. The cases were all resolved without any action taken with osilodrostat. Thus, even if a 
potential causal relationship could be present with osilodrostat and hyperkalaemia this safety concern seems 
sufficiently addressed in SmPC section 4.4. 
Based on data presented it is considered that no changes to the SmPC are warranted. 
Triglycerides increase 
Hyperlipidaemia is a known co-morbidity for Cushing Disease. Triglycerides increase was reported in total 
52/137 (38%) of the subjects of which 4 reported newly occurring or worsening abnormalities grade 3. 
Hypermagnesemia 
Overall, laboratory values (grade 1-3) reported in total in 18/137 (13%) of the subjects. Grade 3 
hypermagnesemia laboratory elevations (>3.0 - 8.0 mg/dL; >1.23 - 3.30 mmol/L) was noted in four subjects. 
The values were resolved at the next evaluation with no dose adjustments and none of the elevations were 
temporarily associated with hypokalaemia or AEs of neuromuscular or conduction system abnormalities.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 103/134 
  
  
  
 
Hypomagnesemia 
Hypomagnesemia was reported in total in 2/137 subjects (1.4%) of which one reported newly occurring or 
worsening abnormalities grade 3. 
Hyperphosphatemia 
Hyperphosphatemia was reported in total in 12/137 (8.7%) of the subjects of which four were reported newly 
occurring or worsening abnormalities grade 3.  Only one of these four subjects presented repeated grade 3 
values without any increase at baseline. The remaining subjects had occasional grade 3 values or an increased 
level at baseline. No AE was reported in association with the increased values. 
Activated partial prothrombin time 
Prolonged activated partial prothrombin time was reported in total in 35/137 (25%) of which one reported a 
newly occurring or worsening abnormalities grade 3 (without any AE). 
Creatine kinase (CK) increase 
In study C2301, increased CPK was reported in total in 32/137 (23%) of subjects of which one reported newly 
occurring or worsening abnormalities grade 3 (a single value) and one grade 4 (increased also at baseline). In 
total, seven cases with (non-serious) AEs of “increased CPK” was reported in study C2301 and C2201. The 
Applicant states that no clear evidence of a causal relationship between osilodrostat (4/7 subjects with AEs had 
confounding factors) and increase in CPK and therefore no changes to the SmPC are warranted. Based on the 
character of the cases with confounding factors present in 4/7 cases and that all events but one was resolved 
spontaneously even if no action to study treatment was taken, wording regarding “CPK increase” was accepted 
for the SmPC for osilodrostat as proposed. 
Hyperglycaemia and HbA1c 
Impaired glucose intolerance is a known co-morbidity for Cushing Disease and at baseline 22% (30/137) of the 
subjects in study C2301, presented with a medical history related to increased FBG. In total 26 subjects (19%) 
of the 137 included subjects reported a newly or worsening increase in FBG compared to baseline and of these 
22 were confounded by disease with a medical history of for example diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or 
diabetes insipidus.  The four remaining cases (classified as mild in severity) had a BMI >25 <30 kg/m2.increased 
fasting glucose was reported in 21/137 (23%) of subjects of which one was reported as newly occurring or 
worsening abnormalities grade 3.  
It is noted that a shift to a worsening in HbA1c (divided by HbA1c groups) from baseline to last post-baseline 
value during the first 26 weeks was reported in 9/137 subjects (6.5%). An HbA1c improvement on the other 
hand was reported in 36/137 (26%) of the subjects. 
In conclusion, the elevation of FBG were in most cases presented in subjects with a medical history of diseases 
related to increased FBG and the initially proposed wording of the SmPC was accepted. 
Uric acid 
In study C2301 increase in uric acid from baseline was noted in 20% (n=28) of the subjects of which 13/137 
(9.5%) reported newly occurring or worsening abnormalities grade 4. The increase included 5 related AEs. No 
AEs of gout was reported. Confounding factors was present in 12 of the 13 subjects with a grade 4 uric acid 
increase. The Applicant claim that that there was no dose relationship between use of osilodrostat and the 
increase of uric acid and that the cases appeared without any pattern after initiation of osilodrostat. It is not 
possible to determine if the increase in uric acid in is related to the underlying disease or a consequence related 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 104/134 
  
  
  
 
to initiation of treatment with osilodrostat. However, since most of the cases with potential clinically significant 
increases had confounding factors the proposed SmPC wording was acceptable.  
Liver Chemistry 
In the pivotal study the overall number of patients with elevations of liver chemistry tests (i.e. ALT or AST > ULN 
but <= 3.0xULN) during the up to data cut-off was 47/137 (34%). Most liver abnormal parameters occurred 
during the dose-titration period. The number of patients with ALT or AST > ULN but <= 3.0xULN during the first 
26 weeks was 35/137 (25.5%) and in 5/137 (13%) during the RW phase (all five in the osilodrostat treatment 
group). Five subjects had an increase in AST and/or ALT above 3xULN. All these cases were confounded by 
disease or concomitant medication.  
Overall, it is agreed with the Applicant that based on the data provided no clinically relevant relationship was 
observed between osilodrostat exposure and liver function test parameters. 
The PT “Transaminases increased” is labelled in SmPC section 4.8 which is endorsed. 
Special laboratory evaluations 
Hormones of the H-P-A (Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis (i.e. ACTH, Aldosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and 
11-deoxycorticosterone, renin, sex hormones and DHEA) were monitored in Studies C2301 and C2201.  
•  ACTH 
As expected, based on the mechanism of action of osilodrostat, an increase in ACTH was noted in all studies. In 
study C2301, the “All Patients group”, mean (SD) plasma ACTH was 18.4 (35.52) pmol/L at baseline, 31.2 
(42.05) pmol/L at Week 12, 35.3 (46.82) pmol/L at Week 24 and 50.0 (69.73) pmol/L at Week 48. At Week 48, 
the mean (SD) percentage change from baseline in plasma ACTH levels was 339.8% (514.85). At the last 
available assessment, the mean (SD) percentage change from baseline in plasma ACTH levels was 472.5% 
(919.77) (Figure 24). 
The Applicant argues that ‘most of the patients’ have ‘at most’ a mild ACTH increase above ULN, based on mean 
(SD) values in updated study C2301 of 56.7 pmol/L (153.3). Updated study C2201 Part II has ranges from 11 
to 637 pmol/L. Although mean levels might show modest increases below the threshold of clinical concern, there 
is clinical concern for the individual patients that have ACTH values that are above the ULN. The applicant has 
updated the SmPC informing the prescriber of the risk to reach high ACTH levels in SmPC section 4.8 
accordingly. 
Long-term safety including hormones of the HPA-axis including ACTH increase is characterised as missing 
information in the RMP which will be followed up in the PASS studies. 
EMA/653461/2019

Figure 21 Mean (SE) ACTH at time points up to Week 48 by treatment group 
•  Aldosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone 
Aldosterone 
Compared to baseline, a decrease in aldosterone was observed over time. In the All Patients group, mean (SD) 
plasma aldosterone was 198.0 (380.14) pmol/L at baseline. At Week 48, the mean (SD) percentage change 
from baseline in plasma aldosterone levels was 37.7% (214.03; n=31). 
11-deoxycorticosterone 
An increase in 11-hydroxicorticosterone is expected due to the known aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) 
inhibition reported for osilodrostat. Thus, compared to baseline an increase in mean plasma 11-deoxycortisol 
and 11-deoxycorticosterone levels was observed over time 
Female patients had higher levels of 11-deoxycortisosterone levels at baseline and during the study compared 
with male patients. In female patients, 11- deoxycortisosterone levels peaked at W12, after which they slightly 
decreased and stabilized thereafter. 
•  Renin 
In the development program of osilodrostat for treatment of hypertension an increased plasma renin activity, 
ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 μg/L*h, was observed. 
Compared to baseline, an increase in mean plasma renin levels was observed over time in all patients (study 
C2301). In study C2201, mean values were fluctuating throughout the study but the mean change was ~155% 
at end of study. 
•  Sex hormones  
Estradiol and estrone 
In study C2301, an increase in mean serum estradiol and estrone levels was observed over time in both male 
and female patients compared to baseline.  
In study C2201, estradiol values in females fluctuated between 112.7 to 993 pmol/L from a baseline value of 
232.13 pmol/L.  Compared to baseline, there was little change in estradiol values in males. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 106/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Testosterone 
During the dose-titration period in study C2301, an increase from baseline in mean testosterone levels was 
observed in both male and female patients in the all patients group.   
Testosterone levels decreased in female patients randomized to placebo and the effect was reversed when 
osilodrostat treatment resumed (study C2301). 
In study C2201, testosterone values in males increased from a baseline value 7.44 nmol/L to maximum of ~15 
nmol/L. The values remained stable for the remainder of treatment. There was little change in testosterone 
levels in females. 
Follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) and Luteinisation hormone (LH) 
In study C2301, the mean (SD) percentage change from baseline in plasma follicle stimulating (FSH) hormone 
levels was 26.5% (103.28) at week 48 and the mean (SD) percentage change from baseline in plasma 
luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was 34.1% (118.89). 
Menstrual disorders 
A total of 27 patients/subjects had menstrual AEs clustered under the “reproductive system and breast 
disorders” in studies C2301 (16/137), C2201 (4/19) and C2108 (7/24). When looking at patients or subjects 
with menstrual disorders (amenorrhea/hypomenorrhea, irregular menstruation, or menorrhagia/vaginal 
haemorrhage), after excluding the cases with clear confounders (ongoing conditions of menstrual disorders, 
presence of fibroids or endometrial polyp), the testosterone, androstenedione or oestradiol profile in each 
patient did not provide evidence for an influence of sex hormone accumulation as the reason for the event. 
Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs including sexual steroids is discussed in the section 
regarding “Adverse Events of Special Interest”. 
In summary, the Applicant refers to multiple (cofounding) factors as reasons for the change in sexual hormones, 
such as normalisation of cortisol levels (immediate effect of therapy), hypercortisolism and effect on HPG axis, 
gonadotrophic hormones producing pituitary cells that are damaged (or on the other hand are again recovering) 
after surgery or radiotherapy. In male patients rather a normalisation of testosterone levels can be seen, in 
female patients an increase with a mean level above ULN. However, ADRs are listed in the SmPC and did not lead 
to discontinuations during the study. An additional statement is proposed in SmPC section 4.8 to highlight the 
role of precursor accumulation and testosterone increases in these events. These increased testosterone levels 
seem to be furthermore reversible in the female patients that entered a placebo period. Effects on DHEAS, FSH 
and LH are noted but toward normalisation due to cortisol level normalisation.  
To note is that effect of osilodrostat on sexual hormones is a potential safety issue when used in children and 
adolescent. However, at present osilodrostat should not be used in the paediatric population. This is reflected in 
the SmPC.   
Long-term safety including clinical consequences of increased sexual hormones is characterised as missing 
information in the RMP which will be followed up in the PASS studies. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Blood-pressure  
At baseline mean SBP was 132±15.1 mmHg and mean DBP 85.3±10.6 mmHg in the pivotal study (C2301). 
After 48 weeks treatment mean SBP had decreased by 4.8±12.3 mmHg and DBP 6.3±11.0 mmHg. A shift from 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 107/134 
  
  
  
 
normal baseline levels to the worst post-baseline level “high only” in SBP was reported in 2/137 (1.4%) and a 
“low only” worst post-baseline value was reported in 9/137 (6.5%). Shifts from normal baseline DBP levels to 
the worst “high only” post-baseline was also reported in 3/137 (2.2%) subjects and a “low only” post-baseline 
DBP value in 8/137 (5.8%) subjects. 
As discussed above hypotension could, in individual patients, be a symptom of hypocortisolism or arrhythmia 
and is further discussed in respectively heading in the section “Adverse events of special interest”.  
Body weight 
In the pivotal study, weight was decreased during the study. At base-line median (min-max) weight was 75 
(51-141) kg, at week 26 the median weight had decreased to 71 (44-147) kg and at week the median weight 
was 69 (44-148) kg. 
Of the 137 patients with body weight data at baseline, 6/137 patients (4.3%) had a higher weight value, 44/137 
(32%) had a lower weight value, one had a higher and lower value, and 86 remained in the same weight 
category post-baseline. Overall, the AE of oedema did not correlate with significant body weight change: one of 
the patients had a weight increase of 10% (grade 2) at the time of oedema, and 2 patients had an increase of 
5% in body weight.  
In study C2201 Part 2, there was, a slight reduction in mean body weight (~5%) from baseline, over the 
long-term exposure to osilodrostat. 
Of the total 11 patients with at least one AE of weight decreased (9 in study C2301 and 2 in study C2201), only 
one patient also had preceding or concomitant AEs of at least Grade 2 decreased appetite and/or nausea.  
Electrocardiogram 
For clinically significant ECG results during the studies see the topic QT-prolongations AEs in section “Adverse 
events of special interest”.  
Safety in special populations 
Race 
The limited data in C1201 suggested that Japanese patients (or non-CD versus CD CS) could be at higher risk for 
hepatic AEs/abnormal lab values and hypocortisolism-related events. Additional analyses were requested based 
on study C2301 (98 non-Asian patients, 30 Asian [excluding Japanese] and 9 Japanese patients). The 
assessment whether Japanese patients are at higher risk of certain AEs than non-Asian patients was hindered by 
the fact that only a low number of Japanese patients (9) were included in C2301. For Asian patients, the 
Applicant concluded that the overall safety was largely comparable versus non-Japanese Asian patients.  
However, for the assessment of non-Japanese Asian patients versus non-Asian patients:  
● 5 events occurred with a significantly higher frequency in non-Japanese Asians than in non-Asian patients 
(adrenal insufficiency, diplopia, pituitary tumour benign, pruritus generalized and skin hyperpigmentation); 
● there was a significantly higher number of SAEs in non-Japanese Asians; 
●  9 (30%) non-Japanese Asians discontinued; while the number of discontinuations in non-Asian patients is not 
specifically mentioned, as the total number of discontinuations (Asians and non-Japanese Asians) was 25.5%, 
and 3 Japanese patients discontinued (33.3%), it can be deducted that the discontinuations in non-Asians was 
21.4% so the number of discontinuations for non-Japanese Asian patients is higher than for non-Asian patients.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 108/134 
  
  
  
 
Therefore, it is of importance that a reduction of initial dose in Asian patients should be recommended: 1 mg 
twice daily instead of 2 mg twice daily, taking into account also the higher relative bioavailability, exposure 
(AUCss) and Cmax,ss in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients, as well as the fact that the mean and median 
average dose used in C1201 was lower than the proposed initial dose. This was requested and is now reflected 
in the SmPC. 
Age 
Overall, in all studies the number of subjects above 65 years were limited (n=10) which is now reflected in the 
SmPC.  At baseline the oldest subjects on osilodrostat was 69 years in study 2301 and 75 years in study 1201, 
respectively. 
Although, there seems to be no evidence that elderly patients have a different safety profile for osilodrostat than 
the <65 years old population, this is based on only very limited data in CS patients: 9 patients ≥65 years - ≤74 
years old, and only 1 patient ≥75 years old. Some additional data are provided by the hypertension program in 
130 patients ≥75 years old, although the use is different than in CS patients because at low doses and short 
duration. 
Moreover, CS is less well characterized in elderly (Qiao et al. 2018) and elderly are likely more prone to 
osilodrostat-associated AEs like adrenal insufficiency, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances, cardiovascular 
AEs and there is a decrease in hepatic/renal/cardiac function, or possibly an increase in underlying disease with 
advancing age, which could have an impact on the safety profile. On the contrary, the normalisation of cortisol 
levels with osilodrostat might lead to an improvement of comorbidities like hypertension and CV disease. 
Therefore, as there are still many uncertainties about the safety profile of osilodrostat in elderly, it is added in 
SmPC section 4.2 that caution is recommended. 
Gender 
More females (N=106) were enrolled in Study C2301 than males (N=31). 
Adverse events belonging to the SOC reproductive system and breast disorders were observed more frequently 
among females (21/106; 19.8%) compared to males (2/31; 6.5%), primarily driven by menstrual AE. 
By PT, acne and hirsutism were observed only among female patients (12/106; 11.3% each). None of the AEs 
were grade 3 or higher; none of these AEs led to discontinuation of study drug. 
The most obvious gender difference is regarding testosterone level increases in females, reversible at treatment 
interruption, and associated with mild to moderate cases of hirsutism and acne in some of these patients. This 
is now adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
Renal impairment 
Use in subjects with renal impairment was studied in 9 subjects in study 2104 (phase 1 PK). All subjects in the 
study received only a single osilodrostat dose of 30 mg. In study 2301 and 2201 subjects with moderate to 
severe renal impairment was excluded.  Thus, safety in subjects with renal impairment treated for the intended 
indication could not be considered sufficiently covered by the presented data.  However, since there is an 
individual dose up-titration based on monitoring including tolerability there is no suspicious regarding safety in 
these populations.   
Hepatic impairment 
Dose recommendations and adjustments for subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is reflected 
in SmPC section 4.2. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 109/134 
  
  
  
 
See section 2.4.2. for assessment of pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
In the clinical studies patients with liver disease or with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) >3×ULN, or serum total bilirubin >1.5×ULN in study C2301 and >2 ULN in study 
C2201, were excluded. 
Safety of use of osilodrostat in subjects with hepatic impairment has not fully been studied in the pivotal trials 
due to the exclusion criteria. It is reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 that experience of use in subjects with 
hepatic impairment is limited. 
Immunological events 
Antibody formation is not relevant for the substance. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Oral contraceptives 
No clinically significant drug-drug interaction was observed when oral contraceptives (containing EES and LVG) 
was co-administered with osilodrostat (40 mg during 12 days) in 24 healthy female subjects receiving cortisol 
replacement therapy (study C2108), suggesting that OC can be co-administered with osilodrostat and provide 
adequate contraception. This is reflected in SmPC section 4.5 
CYP enzymes 
Osilodrostat is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19, and a weak inhibitor 
of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 at a single dose of 50 mg. Co-administration of osilodrostat was studied (Study 
C2102) and resulted in: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a 2.54-fold increase in exposure of caffeine (a CYP1A2 substrate); there was no change in the rate of 
absorption of caffeine 
a 1.86-fold increase in exposure of omeprazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) 
a 1.54-fold increase in exposure (AUCinf) of dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 substrate) 
a 1.50-fold increase in exposure of midazolam (a CYP3A4/5 substrate) 
In SmPC section 4.5 interactions with osilodrostat and CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 substrates is reflected. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Discontinuations of study drug due to AEs were reported in 18/137 (13%) in study C2301 and 3/19 (16%) in 
study C2201 (part 2). As for adverse events leading to dose interruption or adjustment, the most common PT 
reported was adrenal insufficiency (n=4 in study C2301). Besides this PT and Pituitary tumour/Pituitary tumour 
benign, no PT was reported in more than one subject. 
The Applicant confirmed that 3 additional discontinuations because of AEs were grouped in the “Patient 
withdrawals” instead of in the “Discontinuations for AEs” reasons. Additionally, in the safety up-date, with 
cut-off 15 Oct 2018, the number of patients with discontinuations due to AEs has increased from 18 to 24 
patients, so in total there were 27.   
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 110/134 
  
  
  
 
Use in pregnancy  
General toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies in rats/mice have identified reproductive organs 
(ovaries, uterus, vagina and prostate) as target organs of toxicity for osilodrostat. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant or breast-feeding women.  Based on these findings in animals and the 
mechanism of action of osilodrostat, it can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For this 
reason, females that participated in the clinical trials were to refrain from getting pregnant for the duration of the 
study.  
In study C2301, one unconfirmed pregnancy (positive pregnancy test could later not be confirmed by ultrasound 
scan and the serum human chorionic gonadotropin values subsequently reverted to normal) and one elective 
abortion for social reasons (no abnormalities were reported in the foetus) following maternal exposure were 
reported.  
Non-clinical data demonstrates reproductive toxicity of osilodrostat. Therefore, osilodrostat should not be used 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. This is reflected in the SmPC 
section 4.4 and 4.6. The argument by the Applicant that there in fact is a high risk for foetal (and maternal) 
morbidity and mortality for subjects with Cushing’s disease by the nature of the disease is supported. Therefore, 
for this specific population it is agreed that a contraindication for pregnancy seems unnecessary.  
The risk “Reproductive toxicity/Embryofoetal development” is characterized as an important potential risk in the 
RMP with routine PV and RMM, which is endorsed. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety  
Overall, the number of subjects treated in the intended population, endogenous Cushing´s syndrome in adults, 
is low (n=165).  In the pivotal study (C2301) and the proof-of concept study (C2201) part II, 134 subjects have 
been treated more than 6 months and 107 subjects have been treated more than 12 months. In the safety 
update submitted for study C2301 (cut-off date 15-Oct-2018), 110 patients were exposed to osilodrostat for at 
least 156 weeks. The additional median exposure compared to the primary cut-off date was approximately 30 
weeks. 
Additional safety results are pending and will be available from extension of all three studies performed in the 
intended population.  
The safety database is not considered representative for the full target population of endogenous CS as for the 
non-CD form of CS, only 9 patients were included which were all of Japanese origin, and of which only 4 patients 
continued after week 12 and only 2 completed the study period II at week 48. The safety profile can be different 
in these patients but mainly due to AEs related to the disease, its extent and complications. The study data in the 
non-CD CS patients, although very limited, in combination with an acceptable mechanistic reasoning and a high 
unmet medical need currently results in a positive benefit-risk analysis. To ensure this the safety data “Use in 
non-Cushing disease Cushing syndrome subjects including long-term effects” has been characterised as a 
population with missing information in the RMP which will be followed up in the PASS studies. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 111/134 
  
  
  
 
Common adverse events 
Subjects with CS have several co-morbidities which makes the assessment of a potential relationship between 
osilodrostat and the event difficult. In addition, the number of subjects is low and a comparison to placebo is 
only possible during the 8 weeks withdrawal phase in study C2301. However, during this phase the 36 subjects 
randomised to placebo all had been treated with osilodrostat before randomisation. 
All subjects (100%) included in the studies experienced at least one AE. In the studies performed in subjects 
with Cushing’s disease (C2301 and C2201 part II) AEs were most commonly reported within the SOCs 
“Gastrointestinal disorders”, “Infections and infestations” and “General disorders and administration site 
conditions”. The overall most common PTs reported were nausea, fatigue and headache. To note is that both 
nausea and headache was reported with higher frequencies in subjects on osilodrostat compared to placebo 
during the RW period (C2301), indicating a direct unfavourable effect of osilodrostat (and not background 
disease). The most common AEs are considered adequately reflected in the SmPC. Overall, 93-95% of the 
subjects in study C2301 and Study C2201 Part II (CS) experienced AE that was judged as related to study drug 
by the investigators.  
Overall, besides in general lower frequencies of reported AEs, no new safety findings have been identified 
regarding the AE profile when comparing treatment with low-dose osilodrostat in subjects with hypertension 
(study A2201, A2206 and A2216) with treatment with osilodrostat in higher doses in the subjects with 
endogenous Cushing syndrome. 
Serious adverse events were reported in subjects in approximately one third (30% to 45%) of the subjects 
across the studies covering the intended population. The most commonly reported PTs were adrenal 
insufficiency/ adrenocortical insufficiency acute and pituitary tumour/pituitary tumour benign.  Overall, one 
death (suicide) occurred. 
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were observed in approximately 15% patients/subjects across 
studies. The most common PT reported were adrenal insufficiency and pituitary tumour/pituitary tumour benign 
reported by 4, 4 and 2 subjects respectively (study C2301). 
The considered major safety concerns related to use with osilodrostat in the actual doses are included in the 
topics of categorised as adverse events of special interest. The selected AESIs are considered adequate and 
discussed in the following: 
Adverse events of special interest 
•  Hypocortisolism-related AEs 
Approximately half of the population reported hypocortisolism related AEs (regardless laboratory values) in 
study C2301 (52%) and C2201 part 2 (42%). Among the 167 events reported in study C2301 the Applicant 
concludes that 67 events (40%) occurred during any up-titration (defined as occurred within 14 days after dose 
increase) and 96 events (57%) occurred during “maintenance” periods when the subjects used stable doses. 
However, when relating the AEs during periods of titration, to laboratory values it was noted that 27% of the 
events, reported had correspondingly mUFC values below LLN. In the remaining cases the values were normal 
or even above ULN. Thus, there is an incoherence between adverse events related to hypocortisolism and 
laboratory values. The reason for this is probably a misclassification of the AEs by the investigators but also the 
fact that the subjects sometimes experience subjective symptoms when the cortisol levels decreases from high 
to normal levels. However, it could be concluded that the frequency of “true” hypocortisolism events seems 
lower than initially estimated. This is reassuring. However, it is a weakness with the study that the factual 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 112/134 
  
  
  
 
frequency of hypocortisolism is not possible to estimate in the data presented. This depends on different factors; 
ambiguity regarding the description of AEs (GCP finding) and uncertainty in laboratory values due to different 
measuring methods. Furthermore, the recommended dosing in the proposed SmPC differs from that used in the 
studies. Thus, further analyses of the study data was not considered to change the B/R balance or result in major 
SmPC changes.  
The proposed pharmacovigilance and RMM activities are considering sufficient; hypocortisolism is characterised 
as an important identified risk in the RMP. In addition, the Applicant has committed to a targeted follow-up 
questionnaire (including laboratory values) to follow events of hypocortisolism in routine pharmacovigilance. 
Events related to hypocortisolism will also be studied as a topic related to long-term safety. 
The risk for hypocortisolism is reflected in the SmPC (mainly in section 4.4). 
•  QT-prolongation   
Potential for arrhythmia including QT prolongation is a known safety issues with osilodrostat and a 
dose-dependent risk for QT-prolongations has been demonstrated both in pre-clinical data and healthy subjects 
(TQT study C2105).  The mechanism by which osilodrostat may cause QT-prolongation is not well understood. 
In line with the scientific advice provided by the CHMP in 2013, ECG was monitored in study C2301. 
A QTcF change of 5.3 ms was observed in C2301 from baseline at Week 48 and was also predicted based on 
concentration-dependent QT model from the TQT study and the population PK predicted Cmax following 30 mg 
dose. In the pivotal study (C2301) five patients out of 137 (3.6%) had electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
non-serious AEs (none had a SAE) and overall, the number of subjects with clinically significant 
QT-prolongations in study C2301 is considered low and no new QTcF of > 500 ms was observed (confirmed by 
central reading). Only 1 patient discontinued the study drug due to ECG QT prolonged AEs; for 4 events 
osilodrostat was temporarily interrupted and re-initiated at the same or at reduced dose after which no new QT 
event was reported while for 9 of the events no action towards osilodrostat was required.  
However, subjects with risk for QT-prolongations and subjects with several CV diseases were excluded in the 
studies.  
Recommendations for monitoring of ECG and electrolytes to manage the risk are described in SmPC section 4.4. 
The requested analysis did not permit to identify a time period in which it would be appropriate to have a more 
focused monitoring, no new risk factors/contributing factors could be identified either. In case the ECG interval 
exceeds 480 ms prior or during treatment, cardiology consultation is recommended (as stated in the SmPC). 
While it was agreed with the Applicant not to add a formal CI in patients with CV diseases or risk factors for QT 
prolongation, further warning about the fact that the B/R should be carefully weighed in these high-risk patients 
that were excluded from the studies was added. In addition, CV safety/QT prolongation in patients with CS, 
including those with CV diseases or risk factors for QT prolongation is in place as missing information in the RMP 
for osilodrostat which will be followed-up in the PASS studies.  
Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs   
Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation is a result of the mechanism of action of most cortisol inhibitors 
resulting in potential increase in circulating levels of cortisol and aldosterone precursors (11- deoxycortisol, 
11-deoxycorticosterone), and sexual steroids. 
Overall, based on results from the pivotal study a risk for adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs 
could be considered since 42% of the subjects reported any of these events. Severe cases (grade 3) were 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 113/134 
  
  
  
 
reported mainly for hypertension (15/17 cases) and hypokalaemia (6/18 cases). However, the overall 
seriousness of these events is considered relatively low and manageable. 
Hormones of the HPA-axis and clinical consequences of increased sexual hormones will also be studied as a topic 
related to long-term safety. 
• 
Pituitary tumour enlargement-related AEs 
In total, six subjects reported “pituitary tumour” and “pituitary tumour benign” initially as AEs (including 7 SAEs) 
and they were all related to events reflecting growth of the underlying pituitary adenoma. In addition, three 
cases of diplopia were reported. 
In MRI data from study 2301 an enlargement of the pituitary tumour was observed in 44% of the subjects and 
a tumour volume decrease was observed in 56% of the patients (measured as ≥ 20% increase/decrease in 
tumour volume by 3 maximum dimensions (mm3) or 2mm increase in longest diameter). Reassuringly, 
additional data submitted after implementation of Amendment 5 identified only one subject with a 
re-occurrence, among the 46 subjects without measurable pituitary tumour at baseline. However, a new 
invasiveness of pituitary tumour growth was reached by 6 subjects among the 46 subjects with non-invasive 
pituitary tumours at baseline. Five of the six cases had adverse events related to tumour volume increase and 
either discontinued study drug or was withdrawn from the study, which is considered relevant. It is agreed with 
the Applicant that overall there was no evidence of tumour enlargement in association with use of osilodrostat. 
However, due to the mechanism of action (with increased ACTH production due to a negative feed-back of low 
cortisol levels) an increase in tumour volume could not be excluded in individual cases. Therefore, in the 
individual cases it is difficult to assess if an enlargement of the pituitary tumour is only due to the disease (CD) 
or might have been enhanced by osilodrostat treatment. However, with the data presented regarding subjects 
reaching tumour invasiveness when not showing tumour invasiveness before start of treatment, a stage/degree 
of tumour growth could be identified where continued osilodrostat treatment might not be advisable, should 
osilodrostat treatment enhance tumour growth. Therefore, it was considered of value to inform the prescriber 
that treatment with osilodrostat should be discontinued in case of a tumour enlargement reaching the degree of 
invasiveness in subjects without invasiveness before treatment. This information is now included in SmPC 
section 4.4 and the PL.  
Laboratory findings 
Anaemia/decreased haemoglobin is a known effect related to the intended normalisation of chronic cortisol 
excess. 
Anaemia/iron deficiency anaemia/haemoglobin decreased was reported as an AE in 13% patients in C2301 as of 
15-Oct-2018, in 5/19 (26%) patients in C2201 (as of 14-Nov-2017), and one patient in C1201. However, the 
mean Hb value in study C2301 had only a modest decreased over time and a substantial amount of the cases 
with anaemia were confounded and in study C2301. 
Hormones of the HPA-axis (including ACTH increase) and clinical consequences of increased sexual hormones 
will also be studied as a topic related to long-term safety. 
Safety in special populations 
• 
There seem to be some differences in the safety profile of non-Japanese Asian patients versus non-Asian 
patients based on data from C2301. Asian patients also had differences in some PK parameters and the 
mean and median average dose used in C1201 was lower than the proposed initial dose. Therefore, a 
reduction of initial dose in Asian patients is recommended which is now reflected in the SmPC. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 114/134 
  
  
  
 
• 
The most obvious gender difference is regarding testosterone level increases in females, reversible at 
treatment interruption. This is now reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
•  Overall, the number of subjects above 65 years are limited in the studied population (n=10). As there 
still are many uncertainties about the safety profile of osilodrostat in elderly, it has been added in SmPC 
section 4.2 that caution is recommended.  
•  Safety of use of osilodrostat in subjects with renal impairment has not fully been studied in the pivotal 
trials due to the exclusion criteria.  However, since there is an individual dose up-titration based on 
monitoring including tolerability there is no specific concern regarding safety in these populations.  
• 
Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment were excluded from the three pivotal studies. 
However, dose recommendations, based from results of PK study C2103, have been established for 
subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, and general safety is not considered a problem 
in this population. In study C2301, liver parameters (AST/ALT) were increased in 25% of the subjects 
during the titration phase. However, the increases were in general small (< 3xULN) without any 
clinically significance for the included subjects (with normal and mild hepatic impairment). However, 
specifically hepatic safety effects of osilodrostat in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment have not been studied (due to exclusion criteria). Thus, it is now reflected in the SmPC 
section 4.2 that experience of use of osilodrostat in subjects with hepatic impairment is limited. 
Use during pregnancy 
General toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies in rats/mice have identified reproductive organs 
(ovaries, uterus, vagina and prostate) as target organs of toxicity for osilodrostat. Thus, as reflected in the 
SmPC (section 4.6) osilodrostat should not be use in pregnant women. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The population with Cushing disease has several co-morbidities and it is a challenge to distinguish these 
symptoms from adverse events related to treatment. Adverse events were reported in all subjects and most 
commonly reported were PTs related to GI events. The most common reported events were nausea, fatigue and 
headache.  
Significant safety issues identified were the known risks for osilodrostat namely hypocortisolism related AEs 
which were reported in high frequencies (51% in the pivotal study) especially during the titration phase 
(however these events did not always correspond low cortisol levels), QT-prolongations and adverse events 
related to adrenal precursor accumulation. Subjects with risk factors for QT-prolongations including several 
cardiovascular diseases were excluded in the clinical trials.  
The two major safety concerns (hypocortisolism and QT prolongations) can be serious and potentially 
life-threatening, if not adequately treated, require specific monitoring and in some cases temporary dose 
reduction or interruption, or discontinuation of osilodrostat. They will be further followed up in a real-life 
post-marketing setting in the form of PASS studies, including also a specific follow-up of hormones of the 
HPA-axis (including ACTH increase) and clinical consequences of increased sexual hormones. Use in non-CD CS 
subjects is limited and will also be further evaluated and followed in the PASS studies.

Disease Cushing 
Syndrome patients 
including long-term 
effects 
For the category 3 Registry study (Multi-country, observational study to collect clinical information on patients 
with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome treated with osilodrostat and to document the long-term safety), the 
applicant is expected to submit a full PASS protocol for review by PRAC within 4 months post approval. 
The main considerations to be addressed at the time of full PASS protocol submission are as follows: 
•  Study design: 
-  Taking into account the advantages of using patient registries to perform observational studies to evaluate 
the long-term safety of medicinal products used to treat rare diseases, the applicant is encouraged to make 
efforts to perform this study in ERCUSYN registry study.  
-  The design of the study proposed by the applicant is purely descriptive. In order to evaluate the possible 
association between exposure and outcomes, the applicant is encouraged to select a control group. The 
possible selection bias should be discussed among the limitations of this study. In addition, the measures to 
avoid or minimize it should be provided. 
-  The applicant should discuss the period of 3 years as follow-up period. In addition, they should clarify if the 
period of recruitment will finish when the proposed number of patients (50 patients) is reached and if the 
period of follow-up will be different depending on the time of entry into the cohort.   
-  The applicant should explain if all the patients who discontinue osilodrostat prematurely (follow-up < 3 
years) will be excluded. The information of the patients who discontinue the treatment with osilodrostat could 
be relevant for the evaluation of the safety. It would be important to analyse if there are differences between 
the patients who discontinued prematurely the osilodrostat and the patients that do not stop the treatment. 
•  Research questions and objectives: 
-  The two major safety concerns (hypocortisolism and QT prolongations) may be covered with the design of 
this study but is not clear if other safety endpoints included among the objectives of the study such as the 
clinical consequences of increased ACTH or the cardiac safety will be reached with such small sample size. 
The applicant should justify this in order to update the research questions and objectives or to discuss it as 
limitations of the study. Note that according to the Part III.3, this registry will also address the missing 
information “Use in non-Cushing Disease Cushing syndrome patients including long-term effects” but it is not 
reflected in the objective of the studies and should be clarified. In addition, the applicant should explain if a 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 117/134 
  
  
  
 
 
 
minimum number of patients with non-CD are expected among these 50 patients (only 9 patients were 
included in the development clinical programme). 
-  The endpoint primary for primary objective is the incidence of osilodrostat related adverse events and serious 
adverse events during the 3-year observation period. The applicant should clarify if the estimation will be 
cumulative incidence or incidence rate. Also, if a comparator group is finally used, measures to compare the 
incidence should be used.  
•  Study size:  
-  Apart from the power of the sample size to observe the events of hypocortisolism and QT prolongation, if the 
study is performed in the ERCUSYN database, an approximation of how many of the patients included in the 
registry are susceptible to be treated with medical therapy, and how many are estimated to be treated with 
osilodrostat should be provided.  
-  Nonetheless, the applicant should discuss the limitations derived from the small the sample size.  
-   This observational study will allow the inclusion of patients excluded from the clinical development such as 
patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and CV diseases. It is unlikely that a representative number of 
patients with these risk factors are included in a sample size of 50 patients. This should be discussed by the 
MAH and if necessary, it should be included in the limitations of the study.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will use the European birth date (EBD) to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of osilodrostat with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers osilodrostat to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Isturisa (osilodrostat) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Isturisa was: 
“Isturisa is indicated for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults.” 
Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is divided into adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent CS and 
ACTH-independent CS. ACTH-dependent CS accounts for about 80% of all cases and is caused by an 
ACTH-secreting pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing’s disease (CD)) or by ectopic ACTH secretion by a 
non-pituitary tumour. The ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) causes approximately 10% of all cases of CS. 
ACTH-independent CS accounts for 20% of all causes of CS and is most frequently caused by a unilateral 
cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma and less frequently by bilateral macro- or micronodular adrenal hyperplasia 
and a cortisol-producing adrenal carcinoma. 
The aim of the therapy is not to cure the disease but to control the hypercortisolism, thereby limiting the 
consequences of the disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first-line treatment of nearly all forms of CS is surgical resection of the underlying tumour. Post-surgical 
remission rates of 60 to 90% have been reported in CD and up to 80% in EAS. However, long-term follow-up of 
CD patients in remission shows a recurrence rate of up to 60% at 10 years.  
Radiotherapy is a possible alternative for CD patients; however, the treatment is associated with significant side 
effects and reoccurrence of disease.  
For ACTH-dependent CS patients not controlled by removal of the ACTH-secreting tumour and when medical 
therapy did not result in biochemical control, bilateral adrenalectomy is the remaining non-medical treatment 
option.  
Medical therapy  
To date, there is no single, established standard of care medical therapy for endogenous CS worldwide. Medical 
therapy is indicated in patients with hypercortisolism of adrenal origin (i.e., patients with adrenal hyperplasia, 
adenomas, and carcinomas) who are not surgical candidates or for whom surgery is not available or which is 
unlikely to cure the CS/hypercortisolism) and for patients not cured after surgery or have recurred after initial 
control by surgery. The goal is clinical normalization using cortisol levels as a proxy endpoint (except for 
mifepristone). This can be achieved either with a “block and replace” strategy in which circulating cortisol is 
reduced to minimally detectable levels and glucocorticoid replacement is added (avoiding supraphysiological 
doses) or with a “normalization” strategy aimed to achieve eucortisolism. If there is evidence of significant 
cyclicity, block and replace may be preferable, but it carries additional risk if higher doses and multiple 
medications are needed. Currently available medical therapies for CS are classified based on the site of drug 
action and include pituitary-directed drugs, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor 
antagonists (Tritos and Biller 2018). 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 121/134 
  
  
  
 
 
Pituitary-directed drugs 
Pasireotide (Signifor) was approved in 2012 via centralized procedure for the “treatment of adult patients 
with Cushing’s disease for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed.” In the pivotal study 
of the intramuscular formulation, 41% of patients were controlled at the primary endpoint (Lacroix 2018). 
Advantages include the once monthly frequency of administration (for the recently approved intramuscular 
formulation) and the causal nature of therapy (reduction of excess pituitary ACTH secretion). Disadvantages 
include a risk of hyperglycaemia resulting from the inhibition of insulin secretion. Due to its mode of action, 
pasireotide cannot be used in patients with ACTH-independent causes of Cushing’s syndrome. 
Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors 
Steroidogenesis inhibitors are recommended under the following conditions: 
•  As second-line treatment after transsphenoidal surgery in patients with CD, either with or without 
RT/radiosurgery; 
•  As primary treatment of EAS in patients with occult or metastatic EAS together with targeted therapies 
to treat the underlying tumour; 
•  As adjunctive treatment to reduce cortisol levels in adrenocortical carcinoma. 
Ketoconazole (Ketoconazole HRA) was approved in 2014 via centralized procedure for “the treatment of 
endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults and adolescents above the age of 12 years” (Ketoconazole was 
previously approved for the treatment of fungal infections but removed from the market due to the high risk of 
hepatotoxicity). A control rate of 49% at last available assessment has been reported in a retrospective patient 
record review (Castinetti 2014; no prospective trial data are currently available). Ketoconazole can be used in 
all types of Cushing’s syndrome however it has the potential for severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity, its 
high drug-drug-interaction potential (because of its relatively unspecific inhibitory effects, a broad range of 
enzymes both within the steroidogenesis pathway and elsewhere are inhibited, resulting e.g. in near complete 
testosterone suppression), and the limited titration range (starting dose is one 200mg tablet tid; maximum 
dose is two 200mg tablets tid). 
Metyrapone (Metopirone) inhibits adrenocorticosteroid synthesis and is approved via national or mutual 
recognition procedure in 15 member states for “the management of patients with endogenous Cushing’s 
syndrome” (first EU approval UK 1973). The response to metyrapone is rapid, and the desired cortisol levels 
can be achieved after two weeks of treatment (Verhelst et al 1991). Control rates ranging from 64% to 94% 
have been reported with long-term use (>6 months) in a retrospective study (Daniel et al 2015), however the 
choice of biochemical monitoring tests and frequency of monitoring varied.  Metyrapone has a lower impact on 
testosterone levels compared to ketoconazole (Fleseriu et al 2016). Gastrointestinal side effects are common 
but may be reduced by taking the capsules with milk or after a meal. The product is large (8x19 mm) and due 
to the short half-life three to four times daily administration is required.  
Mitotane (Lysodren) was approved via centralized procedurein 2004 for the “symptomatic treatment of 
advanced (unresectable, metastatic or relapsed) adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC)” since Apr-2004. 
Advantages include the strong adrenolytic effect in the symptomatic treatment of advanced adrenal 
corticocarcinoma; disadvantages include the very slow onset of action and accumulation in storage sites in fat 
(reported terminal plasma half-lives range from 18 to 159 days) and the need for serum level monitoring. 
Mitotane has serious neurological, gastrointestinal and hepatic side effects and causes hypercholesterolemia, 
which significantly limits its benefit risk in non-malignant Cushing’s syndromes. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 122/134 
  
  
  
 
Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist that has been used off-label in the treatment of Cushing’s disease, based 
on an observed reduction in UFC levels in patients who have tumours with high expression of D2 receptors (De 
Bruin 2008). 
Etomidate is a sedative which is sometimes used as a parenteral (intravenous) hypocortisolaemic agent 
before or during adrenalectomy in patients with severe life-threatening hypercortisolaemia where rapid control 
of cortisol levels is required and oral therapy is problematic. However, a highly co-ordinated multidisciplinary 
approach is necessary for the management of unwell hypercortisolaemic patients, as these patients have 
complex problems beyond the daily ward scope of medical and nursing staff. The clinical setting of an intensive 
care or high dependency unit is therefore recommended for close patient and biochemical testing monitoring, 
particularly for serum cortisol and potassium levels and the documentation of the level of sedation. 
Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists 
Inhibition Use of these class of products with their action on the glucocorticoid receptor has been described  in 
patients with Cushing’s syndrome, but  are not authorised for this use in the EU and have limited or no 
availability in the EU.  
Following the unmet medical need in CS, attempts have been made to combine different medical treatments in 
order to improve the biochemical control rate and, potentially, improving the safety profile by using lower doses. 
The number of such studies is quite limited and they included a low number of patients.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study C2301 is the main study supporting this application. This was a Phase III, multi-center, double-blind, 
randomised withdrawal (RW) study of osilodrostat following a 24-week, single-arm, open-label dose titration 
and treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osilodrostat for the treatment of patients with CD. 
The study included 137 patients with CD. Patients were eligible for randomisation to the RW part of the study 
(either to continue with osilodrostat or to switch to placebo) if they had completed the dose titration during study 
Period 1, and were classified as complete responders at Week 24 with no dose increase between Week 13 and 
Week 24. Randomisation was implemented at the Week 26 visit. Patients not eligible for randomisation received 
open-label osilodrostat until the end of the Core Period (Week 48), unless there was a reason to discontinue 
from the study prematurely. Of the total study population, 72 patients were participating in the RW part of the 
study. 
The primary objective was to compare the complete response rate at the end of the 8-week period of 
randomization withdrawal (RW) (Week 34). The key secondary objective was to assess the complete response 
rate at the end of individual dose-titration and treatment with osilodrostat in the initial single-arm, open label 
period (Week 24). 
Further data to support the indication sought is provided by study C1201, which is an ongoing Phase II, 
single-arm, open-label, dose-titration study to assess the safety/tolerability and efficacy of osilodrostat in 9 
Japanese patients with endogenous CS except CD (hereafter referred to non-CD CS). 
Some supportive data is also achieved from Study C2201 in which part I was a 10-week exploratory 
proof-of-concept study and part II was a 22-week treatment period after which the long-term efficacy and safety 
of osilodrostat were further investigated in an optional 48-week extension (Extension 1). The extension phase 
was continued as Extension 2 to provide continued access to osilodrostat for patients who completed Extension 
1. The study remains ongoing.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was met as the proportion of patients who completed the randomised withdrawal period 
and maintained mUFC ≤ ULN was significantly higher in the osilodrostat treated group (86.1% vs 29.4%; OR 
13.71 [3.73, 53.44]). The outcome was supported by the sensitivity analyses. 
There was a rather rapid increase in mUFC two weeks after withdrawal in the placebo treated group, and the 
median time to loss of control was 28 days. Since a large proportion of patients in the placebo treated group 
discontinued placebo treatment already at week 26, the absolute difference in mUFC is difficult to interpret. 
The study also met its key secondary endpoint, which was the responder rate at week 24. The definition of 
responders was subjects with mUFC<ULN and without dose increase after week 12. A response rate of 52.6% 
(72/137) was observed at week 24 and the 95% 2-sided CI was (43.9, 61.1) hence, the lower bound of the 95% 
CI was above the pre-specified threshold (i.e. ≥ 30%). If patients who had continued the titration in period 2 
were included, the response rate increased to 67.9%.  
Subgroup analyses were in general consistent with the overall outcome for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
The proportion of responders was largely maintained from week 12 and up to week 48 with a slight decrease 
from 71.5% complete responders at week 12 compared to 66.4% complete responders at week 48. The number 
of patients without prior surgery was low (17) but there was no difference in the responder rate in this group 
compared to the overall population. Non-randomised patients continued open-label osilodrostat treatment 
throughout the course of the study. The overall response rate in this group was somewhat lower than in the total 
population at week 24 (65.2% vs 82.5%) and at week 48 (59.1% vs 75.9%). When looking at individual data, 
all but one patient showed a decrease in mUFC.  
The responder rates observed in the second part of the supporting study C2201, up to week 22, were in the 
same range (78.9%) as observed in the pivotal study. 
The data indicate that the effect is maintained over time in patients responding to treatment, with 64 patients 
showing maintained response 6 months after the initial normalisation of mUFC. The supportive study C2201 
provides data for 17 patients who have been treated up to 46 months, at which time point 58.8% were still 
complete responders. In study C2301, “escape” was evaluated in patients who had achieved control of UFC. 
When applying the protocol definition of escape, the median (KM method) time to “escape” was 560 days. 
In line with the data on mUFC, normalisation of plasma cortisol levels was observed after week 10 except for the 
placebo treated group during the RW period. 
Hypercortisolism causes negative effects on both CV and metabolic risk factors as well as characteristic changes 
to the patient’s habitus. In study C2301, reductions were observed for all CV parameters included in the 
evaluation except for triglycerides. SBP and DBP decreased by 6.8 and 6.6%, respectively. Body weight 
decreased by 4.6%. An increase in BMD was observed, most prominent in the lumbar spine where a 3% increase 
in BMD was observed. There was a favourable shift with regards to features of CD as assessed from two 
photographs taken and reviewed locally by the Investigator. Improvements in QoL scores were also observed. 
In study C1201, which included patients with non-CD Cushing’s syndrome, osilodrostat treatment resulted in a 
mean percent change in mUFC from baseline to week 12 ranging from 52 to 99%. At week 24 the median mUFC 
in the median mUFC was well below ULN (63.9 nmol/24 hr) but only three patients remained in the study. At 
week 48, the two remaining patients showed a 95% decrease from baseline in mUFC levels, but the median 
mUFC was above ULN. The response rate in the first part of the study was comparable to that observed in the 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 124/134 
  
  
  
 
studies in patients with CD. The two patients still on treatment at week 48 were still responding to treatment. 
Data on morning cortisol levels show a normalisation compared to baseline. There were some improvements in 
CV related metabolic parameters whereas no improvements were observed in the QoL scores. 
In study C2301, most patients had achieved ≤ ULN at week 16. The median time to response was 41 days, both 
in the total study population and in the non-randomised group. Single patients reached controlled mUFC after 
about 4 months of treatment. The highest osilodrostat dose was observed at week 10, after which the mean 
dose decreased and stabilised at a mean dose of 10-11 mg daily. In the study, dose increments were made in 
steps of 5 mg twice daily, but in the SmPC a more precautious uptitration is proposed with increments of 1 to 2 
mg twice daily, since uptitration can be made more frequently in clinical practice. A more cautious uptitration is 
important to avoid hypocortisolism.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Only seven subjects aged 65 to 74 years were included in study C2301 and only 3 subjects aged 75 to 85 years 
were included in the development program, thus, the experience in elderly patients is limited but this is reflected 
in the SmPC.  
The study data in patients with non-CD CS of different aetiologies is very limited. The combination of an 
acceptable mechanistic reasoning and a high unmet medical need however results in a positive benefit-risk 
analysis for this population.   
Patients who were on medical treatment were eligible for inclusion in study C2301 after washout periods, which 
were adapted for the different medicinal products used. Since switching from other products, e.g. pasireotide or 
ketoconazole, may occur if osilodrostat is approved, section 4.5 of the SmPC was amended to highlight the need 
for a washout period.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Non-clinical findings 
•  CNS findings 
Although not observed in the rat in single dose safety pharmacology study, unexpected adverse CNS clinical 
signs, without microscopic correlates, were observed in all the animal species used in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity studies (mouse, rat, dog) at osilodrostat exposure multiple <2. However, no concern to that regard did 
arise in the subsequent clinical studies. 
•  QT prolongation (non-clinical part) 
A single dose of osilodrostat caused QT prolongation and also torsade de pointe at high exposure multiples in 
cynomolgus monkey. QTc was also noted in the dog following repeated dosing but not after a single oral dose of 
osilodrostat (max 8mg/kg).  
Clinical findings 
• 
Exposure 
The overall number of subjects treated in the intended population, endogenous Cushing´s syndrome in adults, 
is low (n=165).  In the pivotal study (C2301) and the proof-of concept study (C2201) part II, 134 subjects have 
been treated more than 6 months, 107 subjects have been treated more than 12 months and 11 subjects had 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 125/134 
  
  
  
 
been treated for 48 months or more (all in study C2201 part II). However, further long-term safety data is 
pending from all three studies performed in the intended population. 
For study C2301 a safety update was submitted with a data cut-off date as of 15-Oct-2018. In this up-date the 
median (range) exposure to treatment was 104.1 weeks (range 0.9 to 199.0) weeks. One hundred and ten 
patients were exposed to osilodrostat for at least 156 weeks. The additional median exposure compared to the 
primary cut-off date was approximately 30 weeks. 
Only nine patients for the non-CD form of CS were included, all of Japanese origin, and of which only 4 patients 
continued after week 12 and only 2 completed the study period II at week 48. 
Thus, it is recognized that the number of non-CD CS patients is very limited and that the safety profile can be 
different in these patients but mainly due to AE related to the disease, its extent and complications.  
•  Common AEs 
All subjects (100%) included in the studies experienced at least one AE. The most commonly reported SOCs 
were “Gastrointestinal disorders”, “Infections and infestations” and “General disorders and administration site 
conditions”, reported in 68%, 67% and 65% respectively in the pivotal study (C2301). In this study, the overall 
most common PTs reported were nausea (42%), fatigue (34%) and headache (28%). The majority (> 97%) of 
these events were grades as mild in severity (grade 1 or 2). Dose interruptions or adjustments to manage these 
events was reported in 35% (20/57), 43% (17/39) and 5/46 (11%) of the subjects with nausea, fatigue and 
headache, respectively. Overall in study C2301 and C22012, discontinuations of study drug were reported for 
one subject each of the respectively PT. To note is that both nausea and headache was reported with higher 
frequencies in subjects on osilodrostat compared to placebo during the RW period (C2301), indicating a direct 
unfavourable effect of osilodrostat (and not background disease). The most common AEs are considered 
adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Serious adverse events were reported in approximately one third of the subjects across the studies. The most 
commonly reported PTs were adrenal insufficiency/ adrenocortical insufficiency acute (6%/2% respectively in 
study C2301) and pituitary tumour/pituitary tumour benign (4%/1.5% respectively in study C2301).  
The up-dated safety data for study C2301 with a data cut-off date as of 15-Oct-2018 did non reveal any new 
safety concerns not reflected previous. 
Based on the mechanism of action of osilodrostat several safety issues are known for the substance, these 
include: 
•  Hypocortisolism-related AEs 
All patients treated for endogenous CS are at risk of hypocortisolism; hypocortisolism events have also been 
observed in patients with CS/CD treated with surgery and are listed for other CS/CD medicinal products (CAP: 
ketoconazole, pasireotide), although at a frequency of ‘common’ compared to ‘very common’ for osilodrostat. 
Up-dated data submitted by the Applicant indicated that approximately half of the population reported 
hypocortisolism-related AEs (regardless laboratory values) study C2301 (71/137: 52%) and C2201 part 2 
(8/19; 42%). In study C2301 the 71 subjects reported in total 167 events. Of these 67 events (67/167; 40%) 
occurred during any period of up-titration (defined as occurred within 14 days after dose increase) and 96 
events (57%) occurred during “maintenance” periods when the subjects used stable doses. 
Most of the patient with hypocortisolism-related AEs had just one episode. In total, four patients discontinued 
the study drug due to the adrenal insufficiency AE.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 126/134 
  
  
  
 
Based on initial data submitted for study C2301, a total of 13 patients experienced a SAE of hypocortisolism: 9 
SAEs of adrenal insufficiency were reported in 8 patients, 5 of the SAEs were of grade 3. Two other patients had 
3 SAEs of glucocorticoid deficiency. All episodes of adrenal insufficiency SAE were managed with temporary 
reduction or interruption of the study drug, and with or without administration of glucocorticoids in some 
patients; in 2 patients the event led to study discontinuation. 
However, in an additional analyse it was noted by the Applicant that there was an incoherence between adverse 
events related to hypocortisolism and laboratory values. Correspondingly mUFC values below LLN were noted 
only in 27% (of the hypocortisolism related events during periods of titrations). In the remaining cases the 
values were normal or even above ULN. The reason for this is, according to the Applicant, probably a 
misclassification of the AEs by the investigators. However, it should also be taken into account that subjects 
sometimes experience subjective symptoms when the cortisol levels decrease from high to normal levels. 
Overall, it can be concluded that the frequency of “true” hypocortisolism events seems lower than initially 
estimated. 
Some risk factors for hypocortisolism are known, thus monitoring of cortisol levels with potentially dose 
decrease or interruption is important for prevention.  
•  Arrhythmia and QT prolongations 
Preclinical safety studies have demonstrated that osilodrostat exert cardiovascular concerns, i.e. QT 
prolongation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, in the thorough QT-study (C2105) data showed that 
osilodrostat had a clinically significant effect on QT-prolongation in healthy volunteers. A positive correlation 
between osilodrostat concentration and ΔΔQTcF was noted.  
A QTcF change of 5.3 ms was observed in C2301 from baseline at Week 48 and five patients out of 137 (3.6%) 
had electrocardiogram QT prolonged non-serious AEs, none had SAEs, and no new QTcF of > 500 ms was 
observed (confirmed by central reading). Only 1 patient discontinued the study drug due to ECG QT prolonged 
AEs; for 4 events osilodrostat was temporarily interrupted and re-initiated at the same or at reduced dose after 
which no new QT event was reported while for 9 of the events no action towards osilodrostat was required. 
There are some known risk factors, however in the three clinical studies included in the safety data set (C2301, 
C2201 and C1201) individuals with risk factors for relevant CV diseases and QT–prolongations were excluded.  
Thus, as expected a low number of subjects with QT-prolonged AEs was reported.  
QT prolongation is usually asymptomatic, so ECG and electrolytes monitoring is important with a cardiology 
consultation in case the QTc interval exceeds 480 ms prior or during treatment, to consider whether to initiate 
or to continue osilodrostat, or (temporarily) reduce or interrupt its dose.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 127/134 
  
  
  
 
• 
Pituitary tumour enlargement 
In MRI data from study 2301 an enlargement of the pituitary tumour was observed in 44% of the subjects and 
a tumour volume decrease was observed in 56% of the patients (measured as ≥ 20% increase/decrease in 
tumour volume by 3 maximum dimensions (mm3) or 2mm increase in longest diameter). Additional data 
(submitted after implementation of Amendment 5 [July 2019]) identified one subject with corticotroph tumour 
re-occurrence among the 46 subjects without measurable pituitary tumour at baseline. A new invasiveness of 
corticotroph tumour was reached by 6 subjects among the 46 subjects with non-invasive pituitary tumours at 
baseline. Five of the six cases had adverse events related to tumour volume increase and either discontinued 
study drug or was withdrawn from the study. 
•  Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation AEs 
Adrenal hormone precursor accumulation-related AEs were reported in 42% (n=58) of the subjects in study 
C2301 and 63% (n=12) in study C2201 (part 2). Most reported PTs in the pivotal study (C2301) were 
hypokalaemia (13%; n=18), hypertension (12%; n=17), acne and hirsutism (both reported in 9% [n=12] 
each). Severe cases (grade 3/4) was mainly reported for hypertension (15/17 cases; all cases were considered 
confounded) and hypokalaemia (6/18 cases).  
•  ACTH increase 
Most of the patients had a mild ACTH increase above ULN, based on mean (SD) values in updated study C2301 
of 56.7 pmol/L (153.3). Updated study C2201 Part II had ranges from 11 to 637 pmol/L. 
Use during pregnancy 
General toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies in rats/mice have identified reproductive organs 
(ovaries, uterus, vagina and prostate) as target organs of toxicity for osilodrostat. The SmPC (section 4.4 and 
4.6) states that osilodrostat should not be use in pregnant women. A contraindication for pregnancy is 
considered unnecessary since there in fact is a high risk for foetal (and maternal) morbidity and mortality for 
subjects with (untreated) Cushing’s disease by the nature of the disease.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Multiple factors related to the clinical data can be the source of uncertainties about the safety of osilodrostat in 
CS patients in general: 
An overall limitation with the safety dataset is that the number of subjects treated in the intended population, 
endogenous Cushing´s syndrome, is low (n=165). However, considering the status of orphan drug and the fact 
that information regarding safety is available from the population with hypertension (treated with lower doses 
and shorter durations) the overall exposure is considered sufficient. The proposed indication includes all 
subjects with Cushing´s syndrome, safety in the population with CS due to other reasons than pituitary 
ACTH-producing tumours was however only studied in nine (Japanese) subjects (study C1201). This population 
has now been included in the RMP as missing information and as a topic for long-term safety post-marketing 
follow-up.  
Another limitation with the safety data set is that a comparison to placebo is only possible during the 8 week 
withdrawal phase in study C2301. But during this phase the 36 subjects randomised to placebo all had been 
treated with (and proved to tolerate) osilodrostat before randomisation. Thus, due to lack of placebo-data in 
combination with a population with several comorbidities (AEs overlap with symptoms of the underlying disease 
or comorbidities) it is often difficult to consider a certain causal relationship to the treatment. 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 128/134 
  
  
  
 
Not all data are currently available as the main studies are still ongoing. However, the Applicant has submitted 
an up-dated safety report for study C2301 with a data cut-off date as of 15-Oct-2018. The result of this report 
did not reveal any new safety concerns not reflected previously. However, lack of sufficient long-term safety 
data is still a limitation. Uncertainties are identified regarding long-term safety mainly concerns hypocortisolism, 
CV safety and QT-prolongations, use in non-CD CS subjects, hormones of the HPA-axis including ACTH increase 
and secondary PD effects (e.g. on sexual hormones): 
Hypocortisolism: The risk for hypocortisolism is a non-negligible daily risk for the subjects. The incidence of 
factual hypocortisolism related events with cortisol levels below LLN in the pivotal study (C2301) is an 
uncertainty. The reason for the difficulties to estimate the incidence of hypocortisolism-related events with 
related laboratory values in the data presented, in study C230, is that there was an ambiguity regarding the 
description of AEs for the investigators but also since there appeared to be an uncertainty in laboratory values 
due to different measuring methods.  
Further, the frequency of these events including serious cases (like Addison crisis) in a real-life setting is 
uncertain.  
Considering these uncertainties and the risk for serious cases of hypocortisolism, the most important is at 
present to adequately describe the risk and give adequate dosing and monitoring recommendations in the 
product information. It is considered that SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4 now sufficiently reflect this. Moreover, as 
the long-term frequency of serious cases related to events of hypocortisolism is still uncertain and will be 
followed in the long-term safety PASS.  
QT-prolongation including arrhythmia and Torsade de pointes:  The mechanism by which osilodrostat may cause 
QT prolongation is not well understood which adds a factor of uncertainty. 
In clinical practice there are uncertainties for this risk regarding the individuals with known risk factors for 
QT-prolongations since this population was excluded in the clinical trials and the incidences and 
severity/seriousness after long-term use of osilodrostat in all patients in a real-world setting could be higher. 
Some results regarding cardiac safety after long-term use of osilodrostat will be available by the ongoing 
extension of the studies (C2301, C2201 and C1201). However, in these studies there was a close monitoring 
through scheduled visits and high-risk patients were excluded. Therefore, the risk for QT-prolongation is 
included in the RMP as an important identified risk and will be followed in a real-life long-term study. 
The requested analysis did not permit to identify a time period in which it would be appropriate to have a more 
focused monitoring, and no new risk factors/contributing factors could be identified either. In case the ECG 
interval exceeds 480 ms prior or during treatment, cardiology consultation is recommended. 
While it was agreed with the Applicant not to add a formal contraindication in patients with CV diseases or risk 
factors for QT prolongation, further warning about the fact that the B/R should be carefully weighed in these 
high-risk patients that were excluded from the studies was added in the SmPC. 
Pituitary tumour enlargement: Overall there is no evidence of tumour enlargement in association with use of 
osilodrostat but still, due to the mechanism of action (with increased ACTH production due to a loss of feed-back 
with low cortisol levels), an increase in tumour volume could not be excluded in individual cases. Therefore, in 
the individual cases it is difficult to assess if an enlargement of the pituitary tumour is only due to the disease 
(CD) or might have been enhanced by osilodrostat treatment. With the data presented regarding subjects 
reaching tumour invasiveness when not showing tumour invasiveness before start of treatment, a stage/degree 
of tumour growth could be identified where continued osilodrostat treatment would not be advisable, should 
osilodrostat treatment enhance tumour growth. Therefore, it was considered of value to inform the prescriber 
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 129/134 
  
  
  
 
that treatment with osilodrostat should be discontinued in case of a tumour enlargement reaching the degree of 
invasiveness in subjects without invasiveness before treatment. This information is now included in SmPC 
section 4.4 and the PL.  
There are also uncertainties regarding long-term safety in relation to hormones of the HPA-axis including clinical 
consequences of increased sexual hormones. Therefore, this topic will be studied through long-term post 
authorisation safety study (PASS). 
Although mean levels might show modest ACTH-increases below the threshold of clinical concern, there is 
concern for the individual patients that have ACTH values that are above the ULN and which might reach the 
ACTH threshold for clinical concern reported for Nelson’s syndrome. The SmPC (section 4.8) therefore includes 
information for the prescriber of the risk to reach high ACTH levels. In addition, long-term safety, including 
hormones of the HPA-axis, including ACTH increase, is characterised as missing information in the RMP and will 
be followed in the planned PASS.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
Irrespective of the aetiology in Cushing’s syndrome, controlling the hypercortisolism is an important treatment 
target due to the increased risk of co-morbidities such as CV disease, diabetes and osteoporosis.  
Osilodrostat was shown to effectively lower mUFC in all but one patient in the pivotal study and all but one 
patient in the supportive study in non-CD CS also responded to treatment. Responder rates in the CD population 
was high and clinically relevant with 52.6% of patients being complete responders at week 24. This may be 
compared with data for pasireotide in a comparable study population where 26.3 % in the 900 μg b.i.d. group 
were responders at 6 months. The data from the randomised withdrawal phase of the study further support that 
the effect observed can be contributed to osilodrostat. The reduction in cortisol levels was shown to positively 
affect the consequences of high cortisol levels such as metabolic parameters associated with an increased CV 
risk as well as the Cushingoid habitus of the patients. Treatment with osilodrostat was also associated with a 
meaningful improvement of QoL scores. Furthermore, although limited, the long-term data indicate that the 
effect is maintained up to 46 months. This is of importance since loss of efficacy (“escape”) is frequently 
observed with currently available medical therapies. 
The mechanism of action has been adequately characterised in the development program. Since osilodrostat 
blocks the synthesis of cortisol it is expected to be efficient in all forms of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. This 
is supported by the data from the study in patients with non-CD CS, albeit the limitations of a very small sample 
size. Limitations of data with non-CD CS are reflected in the SmPC. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
Based on available data, and apart from hypocortisolism, the overall tolerability of osilodrostat appears 
satisfactory.

Study data in non-Cushing Disease Cushing Syndrome patients is still very limited but in combination with 
an acceptable mechanistic reasoning and a high unmet medical need currently results in a positive benefit-risk 
analysis. Safety in this population with be further studied in the PASS. 
The risk for “objective” events of hypocortisolism based on laboratory values and the frequency of these 
events including serious cases (like Addison crisis) in a real-life setting is uncertain. Hypocortisolism could lead 
to fatal outcome untreated. However, with the now included recommendations in the SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4 
regarding this risk and dosing, titration and monitoring of cortisol levels during treatment with osilodrostat, the 
risk seems manageable. In addition, the risk is will be further investigated in the PASS. 
Osilodrostat has been shown to cause QT-prolongation, although the overall incidence of clinically significant 
QT-prolongations in the clinical studies was low and only 1 patient discontinued the study drug due to ECG QT 
prolonged AEs while for 4 events osilodrostat was temporarily interrupted but re-initiated at the same or at 
reduced dose after which no new QT event was reported. 
QT-prolongation per see is not automatically considered as serious condition. However, the condition could, if 
not detected, lead to fatal events such as Torsades de pointes. Associated symptoms such as syncope might 
precede (serious) events but most probably not, and prevention and clinical follow-up with ECG and electrolyte 
monitoring is therefore crucial. Cardiology consultation in case the QTc interval exceeds 480 ms is 
recommended to consider whether osilodrostat can be initiated or continued or should be (temporarily) reduced 
or dose interrupted.  
An additional analysis provided during the procedure upon request by CHMP did not permit to identify a time 
period in which it would be appropriate to have a more focused monitoring, and no new risk factors/contributing 
factors could be identified either. Further evaluation of this risk is necessary, since these events are rare and can 
occur at any time during osilodrostat treatment, and high-risk patients were excluded from the clinical studies. 
Therefore, CV safety/QT prolongation in patients with CS, including those with CV diseases or risk factors for QT 
prolongation is included as missing information in the RMP and will be followed up in the PASS . For high-risk 
patients, a warning was added in the SmPC about the fact that the B/R should be carefully balanced. 
There are still some uncertainties of importance regarding the secondary pharmacology effects of 
osilodrostat, e.g. effects on other hormones such as sex hormones. These effects together with the fact that 
osilodrostat has been shown to be teratogenic in non-clinical studies, has implications for the risk if osilodrostat 
is used in pregnancy. The SmPC wording has been updated to mitigate the risk of negative effects on the foetus 
(SmPC section 4.6) and the risk increased levels of testosterone (SmPC 4.8). In addition, hormones of the 
HPA-axis including clinical consequences of increased sexual hormones will be followed up in the PASS. Overall, 
ACTH levels were increased and although mean levels show modest increases below the threshold of clinical 
concern, individual patients may have ACTH values that are above the ULN. the SmPC section 4.8 now reflects 
the risk for increased ACTH levels. In addition, hormones of the HPA-axis including ACTH increase will be 
followed up in the PASS.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The reduction in mUFC shown with osilodrostat treatment in Cushing’s syndrome is considered highly clinically 
relevant and is considered to outweigh the two major risks, hypocortisolism and QT-prolongation. The risk of 
hypocortisolism is considered manageable through careful titration, monitoring of cortisol levels and with 
osilodrostat dose decrease or interruption if necessary. The risk of QT-prolongation is considered to be 
manageable through ECG and electrolyte monitoring, and cardiology consultation if QTc > 480 ms.  
EMA/653461/2019 
Page 132/134 
  
  
  
 
Overall, osilodrostat appears to be well tolerated. However, long-term safety will be followed up in two PASS, 
including follow-up on hypocortisolism, CV safety and QT prolongation, use in non-CD CS patients, hormones of 
the HPA-axis including ACTH increase and clinical consequences of increased sexual hormones. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The agreed, indication for osilodrostat is “treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults”, but it is 
noted that the vast majority of the included patients had Cushing´s disease (i.e. caused by an ACTH-secreting 
pituitary corticotroph adenoma). Since osilodrostat blocks the synthesis of cortisol it is expected to be efficient 
in all forms of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome and extrapolation of efficacy to patients with non-CD CS is 
uncontroversial. However, the safety data in these patients, in particular those with ectopic ACTH-production is 
very limited. Further post marketing data will be collected through  the PASS to follow these patients and to 
confirm effects of efficacy and safety. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Isturisa is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Isturisa is not similar to Signifor and Ketaconazole HRA within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Isturisa is favourable in the following indication:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that osilodrostat is a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0011/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

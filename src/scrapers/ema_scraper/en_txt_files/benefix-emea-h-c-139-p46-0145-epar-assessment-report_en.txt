1.  Introduction 
On 13 July 2016, the MAH submitted a full clinical study report for study B1821048 in accordance with 
Article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. A respective clinical overview has been 
provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The submitted study B1821048 is:  
An Open-Label, Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Study of BeneFIX (Nonacog Alfa, Recombinant Factor IX) 
in Male Chinese Subjects with Hemophilia B 
The purpose for conducting this single dose PK study of FIX activity after BeneFIX administration in 
male Chinese subjects (6 years or older) with hemophilia B is to support the China Food and Drug 
Administration (CFDA) regulatory requirement to fulfill a post marketing commitment for BeneFIX. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
BeneFIX (nonacog alfa) is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic that has structural and 
functional characteristics comparable to endogenous coagulation factor IX (FIX). BeneFIX is indicated 
for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX 
deficiency). BeneFIX is supplied as a powder for reconstitution and intravenous (IV) injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Data of 4 paediatric subjects included in the above mentioned BeneFIX study B1821048 (in total 12 
patients) have been discussed. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study design and Study description 
Study B1821048 was a multiple center, open-label, single-dose BeneFIX study in 12 male Chinese 
subjects with haemophilia B who were age 6 years or older with moderately severe to severe 
haemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%). 
4 of these 12 patients were in the age range ≥6 and <12 years (paediatric subjects). The remaining 8 
patients were ≥ 18 years old (older subjects). 
The dosage form administered was the commercial product approved in China, which was a vial in 1x 
pack containing 250 IU powder for injection. This is the same as the EU commercial product. 
Subjects underwent screening evaluation within 28 days of dosing. Day 0 was defined as the day prior 
to day of dosing (Day 1). On Day 1, subjects received a single dose of BeneFIX 50 IU/kg administered 
by IV infusion within 10 minutes. The dose was calculated based on the subject’s actual body weight 
on Day 1 before dosing. The start and stop times of the infusion were recorded in the Case Report

Form (CRF). Blood samples (2.7 mL) were collected pre-dose (within 2 hours before administration) 
and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 50, 72, and 96 hours post dose. 
All subjects treated with BeneFIX were analyzed for PK and safety parameters up to Day 5 (96 hours 
post dose). Tolerability and safety were assessed during the study by monitoring adverse events (AEs) 
and serious AEs (SAEs).  
The first subject’s first study visit was on 02 March 2015 and the last subject’s last visit occurred on 08 
April 2015. 
Study population 
Of the 12 subjects enrolled, 4 subjects were in the age range of ≥6 and <12 years and 8 subjects age 
≥12 years (all subjects enrolled in this older age group were ≥18 years of age). All subjects were 
Chinese males from two centers in China, all completed the study treatment. The weight of paediatric 
subjects ranged from 28 kg to 42 kg with a mean (±standard deviation [SD]) weight of 33.8 ±6.2 kg, 
and the height ranged from 137 cm to 149 cm with a mean height of 142.3 ±5.1 cm. The body mass 
index (BMI) ranged from 14.9 to 18.9 kg/m2 with a mean BMI of 16.6 ±1.8 kg/m2. 
Samples  
Plasma samples were analyzed for FIX activity using one-stage coagulation assay. Plasma samples 
(collected on Day 0 and Day 5) were analyzed for FIX inhibitor using one-stage coagulation assay. 
Both assays are the same as those that have been used in other clinical studies performed by the MAH. 
There were no issues related to bioavailability identified that would impact efficacy and/or safety of 
BeneFIX. 
Pharmacology 
Methods 
FIX pharmacokinetic parameters following 50 IU/kg doses were assessed in 12 Chinese patients, 4 of 
whom were paediatric subjects, with haemophilia B.  
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 50, 72, and 
96 hours post dose. The PK parameters (maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax], time for 
Cmax [Tmax], area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to the time of the last 
quantifiable concentration [AUClast], area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 
extrapolated to infinite time [AUCinf], steady state volume of distribution [Vss], terminal phase rate 
constant [kel], terminal half-life [t½], mean residence time [MRT], clearance [CL], and incremental 
recovery for FIX activity were calculated for each subject using noncompartmental analysis of plasma 
concentration (FIX activity)-time data. Samples below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were set 
to 0 for the purpose of analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. The PK 
parameters were summarized descriptively by age group (≥6 to <12 years and ≥12 years). 
Concentrations were listed and summarized descriptively by PK sampling time. For summary statistics 
and summary (mean and median) plots by sampling time, the nominal PK sampling time were used. 
For individual subject plots by time, the actual PK sampling times were used. 
Results 
Median plasma concentration-time profiles for FIX activity following a single dose of BeneFIX 50 IU/kg 
are presented in the submitted CSR. Median concentrations in the paediatric subjects were consistently 
lower than those in the older subjects. The PK parameters results are summarized descriptively in 
Table 2 of the clinical overview. Geometric mean AUCinf was about 33% lower in paediatric subjects 
relative to older subjects, while geometric mean Cmax was only slightly (8%) lower. Consistent with 
the lower exposures, systemic CL was higher and t½ was shorter in paediatric subjects than in older 
subjects. Steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was similar in both age groups. Incremental

recovery was also similar in both age groups, with geometric mean values of 0.78 and 0.82 
IU/dL/IU/kg in paediatric subjects and those in the older subjects, respectively. 
In this study, with PK sampling to 96 hours post dose, terminal t½ for plasma FIX activity averaged 28 
hours in the paediatric subjects and 40 hours in the older subjects. Estimates for t1/2 using truncated 
data at 72 hours were shorter, averaging 24 and 30 hours for paediatric and older subjects, 
respectively. With data truncated at 50 hours, the estimates for t1/2 were lower at 18 and 27 hours for 
paediatric and older subjects, respectively. 
Efficacy 
There were no efficacy evaluations done in this study. 
Safety  
Safety was assessed on all subjects who received at least one dose of BeneFIX during the study 
through last subject visit and included adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), vital 
signs, physical examination, and laboratory evaluations. Any clinical laboratory, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate abnormalities of potential clinical concern were to be 
described. 
Methods 
The investigator was to obtain and record on the CRF/DCT (data collection tool) all observed or 
volunteered AEs, the severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of the events, and the investigator’s opinion 
of the relatedness to the study treatment. Adverse events were to include adverse drug reactions, 
illnesses with onset during the study, and exacerbation of previous illnesses. Additionally, the 
investigator was to record as AEs any clinically significant changes in physical examination findings and 
abnormal objective test findings (eg, ECG, laboratory). 
For all AEs, the investigator was to pursue and obtain information adequate to determine both the 
outcome of the AE and whether it met the criteria for classification as an SAE. 
Results 
There were no AEs or study discontinuations reported in this study. Inhibitor against FIX has not been 
reported, no thrombogenicity or allergic reactions were reported during the study. There were no 
clinically meaningful median changes from baseline to last observation for laboratory parameters. 
Mean changes for supine systolic BP, diastolic BP, and supine pulse rate were small and not considered 
clinically relevant. One subject (10 years old) had a ≥20 mm Hg decrease from baseline in supine 
diastolic BP that met the categorical summarization criteria. The subject’s supine diastolic BP at 
baseline was 70 mm Hg and at 96 hours post dose was 50 mm Hg with the reported decrease of ≥20 
mm Hg not considered clinically significant by the Investigator. There were no abnormal vital sign 
values reported as AEs. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Continuing the duration of sample collection after administration of BeneFIX 50 IU/mL to 96 hours 
resulted in estimates of t1/2 at 27.9 ±4.5 hours in paediatric subjects and 39.6 ±7.4 hours in older 
subjects. 
Paediatric subjects had higher CL and shorter t½ compared with older subjects in this study.

Single doses of BeneFIX 50 IU/kg were safe and well tolerated in male Chinese subjects aged ≥6 years 
old with haemophilia B. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic and safety results for the paediatric subjects in this study, the overall 
benefit-risk profile of BeneFIX remains favorable for paediatric subjects.

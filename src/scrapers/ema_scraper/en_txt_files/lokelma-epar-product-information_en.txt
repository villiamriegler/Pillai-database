CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Lokelma is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients (see section 4.4 and 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Correction phase 
The recommended starting dose of Lokelma is 10 g, administered three times a day orally as a 
suspension in water. When normokalaemia is achieved, the maintenance regimen should be followed
(see below).
Typically, normokalaemia is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. If patients are still hyperkalaemic after 
48 hours of treatment, the same regimen can be continued for an additional 24 hours. If 
normokalaemia is not achieved after 72 hours of treatment, other treatment approaches should be 
considered.
Maintenance phase
When normokalaemia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose of Lokelma to prevent recurrence 
of hyperkalaemia should be established. A starting dose of 5 g once daily is recommended, with 
possible titration up to 10 g once daily, or down to 5 g once every other day, as needed, to maintain a 
normal potassium level. No more than 10 g once daily should be used for maintenance therapy.
Serum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during treatment (see section 4.4). 
Missed dose
If a patient misses a dose they should be instructed to take the next usual dose at their normal time.
2
Special populations
Patients with renal impairment
No changes from the normal doses are required for patients with renal impairment who are not on 
chronic haemodialysis.
For patients on dialysis Lokelma should only be dosed on non-dialysis days. The recommended 
starting dose is 5 g once daily. To establish normokalaemia (4.0-5.0 mmol/L), the dose may be titrated 
up or down weekly based on the pre-dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter-dialytic 
interval (LIDI). The dose could be adjusted at intervals of one week in increments of 5 g up to 15 g 
once daily on non-dialysis days. It is recommended to monitor serum potassium weekly while the dose 
is adjusted; once normokalaemia is established, potassium should be monitored regularly (e.g. 
monthly, or more frequently based on clinical judgement including changes in dietary potassium or 
medication affecting serum potassium).
Patients with hepatic impairment
No changes from the normal doses are required for patients with hepatic impairment.
Elderly population
No special dose and administration guidelines are recommended for this population.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Lokelma in children and adolescents (< 18 years) have not been established. 
No data are available.
Method of administration 
For oral use.
The entire contents of the sachet(s) should be emptied in a drinking glass containing approximately 
45 ml of water and stirred well. The tasteless liquid should be drunk while still cloudy. The powder 
will not dissolve. If the powder settles, the liquid should be stirred again and taken. If needed, rinse the 
glass with more water to ensure that all of the content is taken.
The suspension can be taken with or without food.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Serum potassium levels
Serum potassium should be monitored when clinically indicated, including after changes are made to
medicinal products that affect the serum potassium concentration (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system (RAAS) inhibitors or diuretics) and after the Lokelma dose is titrated.
Monitoring frequency will depend upon a variety of factors including other medicinal products,
progression of chronic kidney disease and dietary potassium intake.
Hypokalaemia
Hypokalaemia may be observed (see section 4.8). Dose titration as described under maintenance
posology may be required in such cases to prevent moderate to severe hypokalaemia. In patients with 
severe hypokalaemia, Lokelma should be discontinued and the patient re-evaluated.
3
QT Prolongation
During correction of hyperkalaemia, a lengthening of the QT interval can be observed as the 
physiologic result of a decline in serum potassium concentration.
The risk of interaction with X-rays 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may be opaque to X-rays. If the patient is having abdominal X-rays,
radiographers should keep this in mind.
Intestinal perforation 
The risk for intestinal perforation with the use of Lokelma is currently unknown. Since intestinal 
perforation has been reported with potassium binders including Lokelma, specific attention should be 
paid to signs and symptoms related to intestinal perforation.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains approximately 400 mg sodium per 5 g dose, equivalent to 20% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
Lokelma is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for those on a 
low salt diet. 
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effect of other medicinal products on sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
As sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not absorbed or metabolised by the body, there are no expected 
effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacologic action of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.
Effect of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on other medicinal products
As sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not absorbed or metabolised by the body, and does not 
meaningfully bind other medicinal products, there are limited effects on other medicinal products. 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can transiently increase gastric pH by absorbing hydrogen ions and 
can lead to changes in solubility and absorption kinetics for co-administered medicinal products with 
pH-dependent bioavailability. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects
co-administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate with amlodipine, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, 
furosemide, glipizide, warfarin, losartan or levothyroxine did not result in clinically meaningful drug-
drug interactions. Consistent with co-administration of dabigatran with other gastric acid modifiers,
dabigatran Cmax and AUC values were approximately 40% lower when co-administered with sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate. No dose adjustments or separation of time of dosing are required for any of 
these medicinal products. However, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate should be administered at least
2 hours before or 2 hours after oral medicinal products with clinically meaningful gastric pH 
dependent bioavailability.
Examples of medicinal products that should be administered 2 hours before or after sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate to avoid possible raised gastric pH drug interaction are azole antifungals (ketoconazole, 
itraconazole and posaconazole), anti-HIV agents (atazanavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, raltegravir, ledipasvir and rilpivirine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, dasatinib
and nilotinib).
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can be co-administered without spacing of dosing times with oral 
medicinal products that do not exhibit pH-dependent bioavailability. 
4
In another drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of Lokelma 15 g with
tacrolimus 5 mg resulted in a decreased tacrolimus AUC and Cmax by 37% and 29% respectively.
Therefore, tacrolimus should be taken at least 2 hours before or after Lokelma. In the same study, co-
administration of Lokelma and cyclosporin did not show a clinically meaningful interaction.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lokelma during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
In a postnatal study in rats, maternal exposure to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate had no effect on 
postnatal development. Due to its physicochemical properties, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not 
systemically absorbed and is not expected to be excreted in breast milk. No effects on the breastfed 
newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-feeding woman to sodium 
zirconium cyclosilicate is negligible. Lokelma can be used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate on fertility are available. In rats, there 
was no effect on fertility with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate treatment.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Lokelma has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were hypokalaemia (4.1%) and oedema related events 
(5.7%).
In 2 clinical trials with open label exposure of Lokelma up to 1 year in 874 subjects, the following 
events were reported as related by investigators: gastrointestinal events [constipation (2.9%), 
nausea (1.6%), diarrhoea (0.9%), abdominal pain/distension (0.5%) and vomiting (0.5%)]; and 
hypersensitivity reactions [rash (0.3%) and pruritus (0.1%)]. These events were mild to moderate in 
nature, none were reported as serious and were generally resolved while the patient continued 
treatment. Due to the open label study design, a causal relationship between these events and Lokelma 
cannot be established.
In clinical studies conducted in countries with a predominantly Asian population, constipation with an 
estimated frequency of 8.9% occurred in non-dialysis patients receiving Lokelma; and was resolved
with dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety profile of Lokelma was evaluated in clinical trials involving 1 760 patients with 
507 patients exposed for one year.
The  adverse  reactions  identified  from controlled trials  and  post-marketing  reports are  shown  in 
Table 1. Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class 
(SOC). The  following  convention  was used  for  frequency  of  adverse  reactions:  Very  common 
5
(≥ 1/10);  Common  (≥ 1/100  to  < 1/10);  Uncommon  (≥ 1/1 000 to  < 1/100); Rare  (≥ 1/10 000  to 
< 1/1 000); Very rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Hypokalaemia
In clinical trials, 4.1% of Lokelma patients developed hypokalaemia with a serum potassium value less 
than 3.5 mmol/L, which was resolved with dose adjustment or discontinuation of Lokelma.
Oedema related events
Oedema  related  events,  including fluid retention,  generalised  oedema,  hypervolaemia,  localised 
oedema,  oedema, oedema  peripheral and peripheral  swelling,  were  reported  by  5.7%  of  Lokelma 
patients. The events were observed in the maintenance phase only and were more commonly seen in 
patients  treated  with  15 g.  Up  to 53% were  managed  by  initiating  a  diuretic  or  adjusting  a  diuretic 
dose; the remainder did not require treatment.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Overdose with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate could lead to hypokalaemia. Serum potassium should 
be checked and potassium supplemented as needed.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products; Drugs for treatment of hyperkalaemia and 
hyperphosphatemia, ATC code: V03AE10
Mechanism of action
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a non-absorbed, non-polymer inorganic powder with a uniform 
micropore structure that preferentially captures potassium in exchange for hydrogen and sodium 
cations. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is highly selective for potassium ions, even in the presence of
other cations, such as calcium and magnesium, in vitro. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate captures 
potassium throughout the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract and reduces the concentration of free 
potassium in the GI lumen, thereby lowering serum potassium levels and increasing faecal potassium 
excretion to resolve hyperkalaemia.
6
Pharmacodynamic effects
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate starts reducing serum potassium concentrations as soon as 1 hour after 
ingestion and normokalaemia can be achieved typically within 24 to 48 hours. Sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate does not affect serum calcium or magnesium concentrations, or urinary sodium excretion. 
There is a close correlation between starting serum potassium levels and effect size; patients with 
higher starting serum potassium levels have greater reductions in serum potassium. There is a 
reduction in urinary potassium excretion which is a consequence of a reduction in serum potassium
concentration. In a study of healthy subjects given Lokelma 5 g or 10 g once daily for four days, dose-
dependent reduction in serum potassium concentration and total urinary potassium excretion were
accompanied by mean increases in faecal potassium excretion. No statistically significant changes in 
urinary sodium excretion were observed.
There were no studies conducted to investigate the pharmacodynamics when sodium zirconium 
cyclosilicate is administered with or without food. 
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate has also been shown to bind ammonium in vitro and in vivo, thereby 
removing ammonium and increasing serum bicarbonate levels. Lokelma-treated patients experienced 
an increase of 1.1 mmol/L at 5 g once daily, 2.3 mmol/L at 10 g once daily and 2.6 mmol/L at 15 g 
once daily in bicarbonate compared with a mean increase of 0.6 mmol/L for those receiving placebo. 
In an environment where other factors affecting renin and aldosterone were not controlled, Lokelma 
demonstrated a dose-independent change in mean serum aldosterone levels (range: -30% to -31%) 
compared with the placebo group (+14%). No consistent effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
has been observed.
In addition, mean reductions in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed in the 5 g (1.1 mg/dL) and 
10 g (2.0 mg/dL) three times daily groups compared with small mean increases in the placebo 
(0.8 mg/dL) and low dose sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (0.3 mg/dL) groups.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The potassium-lowering effects of Lokelma have been demonstrated in three randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with hyperkalaemia. All three studies tested the 
initial effect of Lokelma to correct hyperkalaemia during a 48-hour period and two studies also tested 
maintenance of normokalaemia effect obtained. The maintenance studies included patients with 
chronic kidney disease (58%), heart failure (10%), diabetes mellitus (62%) and RAAS inhibitor 
therapy (68%). In addition, two open-label maintenance studies tested long-term safety of Lokelma. 
These five studies included 1 760 patients given doses of Lokelma; 507 exposed for at least 360 days. 
In addition, the efficacy and safety of Lokelma was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
of 196 chronic haemodialysis patients with hyperkalaemia, who received doses of Lokelma for 
8 weeks. In the studies, Lokelma reduced serum potassium and maintained normal serum potassium 
levels regardless of the underlying cause of hyperkalaemia, age, sex, race, comorbid disease or 
concomitant use of RAAS inhibitors. No dietary restrictions were imposed; patients were instructed to 
continue their usual diet without any specified alterations.
Study 1
A two-phase, placebo-controlled correction and maintenance use study
A two-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 753 patients (mean age of
66 years, range 22 to 93 years) with hyperkalaemia (5 to ≤ 6.5 mmol/L, baseline potassium average 
5.3 mmol/L), and included patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and 
those on RAAS inhibitor therapy. 
During the correction phase, patients were randomised to receive Lokelma (1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g or 10 g) 
or placebo, administered three times daily for the initial 48 hours (Table 2).

Lokelma 10 g administered three times daily lowered serum potassium by 0.7 mmol/L at 48 hours 
(p < 0.001 vs. placebo); statistically significant 14% potassium reduction was observed 1 hour after 
the first dose. Patients with higher starting potassium levels had a greater response to Lokelma. 
Patients with pre-treatment potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mmol/L (average baseline 5.8 mmol/L)
saw an average decrease of 1.1 mmol/L at 48 hours while those with starting potassium levels at or 
below 5.3 mmol/L had an average decrease of 0.6 mmol/L at the highest dose.
Patients who became normokalaemic after receiving Lokelma during the correction phase were 
re-randomised to receive once daily placebo or once daily Lokelma at the same dose level as they had 
received three times daily during the correction phase (Table 3).

At the end of the maintenance period, when Lokelma was no longer administered, average potassium 
levels increased to near baseline levels.
Study 2
A multi-phase, placebo-controlled maintenance study with an additional open-label phase 
In the correction phase of the study, 258 patients with hyperkalaemia (baseline average 5.6, range 
4.1 - 7.2 mmol/L) received 10 g of Lokelma administered three times daily for 48 hours. Reductions in 
potassium were observed 1 hour after the first 10 g dose of Lokelma. Median time to normokalaemia 
was 2.2 hours with 66% of patients achieving normokalaemia at 24 hours and 88% at 48 hours. 
Responses were larger in patients with more severe hyperkalaemia; serum potassium fell 0.8, 1.2 and 
1.5 mmol/L in patients with baseline serum potassium < 5.5, 5.5-5.9 and ≥ 6 mmol/L, respectively.
Patients who achieved normokalaemia (potassium levels between 3.5 and 5 mmol/L) were randomised 
in a double-blind fashion to one of three doses of Lokelma [5 g (n=45), 10 g (n=51), or 15 g (n=56)] or 
placebo (n=85) administered once daily for 28 days (the double-blind randomised withdrawal phase).
8
The proportion of subjects with average serum potassium < 5.1 mmol/L from Study Day 8 to 29 
(three-week period) was greater at the 5 g, 10 g and 15 g once daily doses of Lokelma (80%, 90% and 
94%, respectively), compared with placebo (46%). There was a mean decrease in serum potassium of 
0.77 mmol/L, 1.10 mmol/L, 1.19 mmol/L and 0.44 mmol/L, respectively, and the proportion of 
subjects who remained normokalaemic was 71%, 76%, 85% and 48% in the 5 g, 10 g, 15 g once daily 
doses of Lokelma and placebo groups, respectively.
Maintenance phase with Lokelma titration (open-label) results: 123 patients entered the 11-month 
open-label phase. The proportion of subjects with average serum potassium < 5.1 mmol/L was 88%, 
the average serum potassium level was 4.66 mmol/L and the proportion of serum potassium 
measurements below 3.5 mmol/L was less than 1%; between 3.5 and 5.1 mmol/L was 77%; or 
between 3.5 and 5.5 mmol/L was 93%, irrespective of other factors that might influence the serum 
potassium. Treatment was discontinued on study exit (Day 365).
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to relapse for maintenance phase showed dose dependence in time to
relapse with median time for 5 g dose ranging from 4 to 21 days depending on the baseline serum 
potassium values. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically and the Lokelma dose titrated as 
described in section 4.2.

Study 3
A study in chronic kidney disease patients with hyperkalaemia 
This study was a double-blind placebo-controlled dose-escalating study in 90 patients (60 Lokelma 
patients; 30 controls) with baseline eGFR between 30-60 ml/min/1.73m2 and hyperkalaemia (baseline 
9
 
 
 
 
serum potassium 5.2 mmol/L, range 4.6-6 mmol/L). Patients were randomised to receive escalating 
doses of Lokelma (0.3 g, 3 g and 10 g) or placebo, administered three times a day with meals for two 
to four days. The primary endpoint was the rate of change in serum potassium from baseline 
throughout the initial 2 days of treatment. The trial met the primary efficacy endpoint at the 3 g and 
10 g doses of Lokelma compared to placebo. Lokelma at the 10 g dose and the 3 g dose resulted in 
mean maximal reductions of 0.92 mmol/L and 0.43 mmol/L, respectively. Twenty-four hour urine 
collections showed that Lokelma decreased urinary potassium excretion from baseline by
15.8 mmol/24 h compared to placebo increase by 8.9 mmol/24 h (p < 0.001). Sodium excretion was 
unchanged relative to placebo (10 g, increase by 25.4 mmol/24 h compared to placebo increase by 
36.9 mmol/24 h (NS)).
Study 4
A two-phase, multicenter, multi-dose, open-label safety and efficacy study
The long term (up to 12 months) effects of Lokelma were assessed in this study in 751 subjects with 
hyperkalaemia (baseline average 5.59 mmol/L; range 4.3-7.6 mmol/L). Comorbid conditions included 
chronic kidney disease (65%), diabetes mellitus (64%), heart failure (15%) and hypertension (83%). 
Use of diuretics and RAAS inhibitors was reported by 51 and 70% of subjects, respectively. During 
the correction phase, 10 g of Lokelma was administered three times daily for at least 24 hours and up 
to 72 hours. Subjects who achieved normokalaemia (3.5-5.0 mmol/L, inclusive) within 72 hours
entered the maintenance phase of the study. All subjects in the maintenance phase received Lokelma at 
a starting dose of 5 g once daily which could be increased in increments of 5 g once daily (to a 
maximum of 15 g once daily) or decreased (to a minimum of 5 g once every other day) based upon the 
titration regimen.
Normokalaemia was achieved in 494/748 (66%), 563/748 (75%) and 583/748 (78%) of subjects after 
24, 48 and 72 hours of correction phase dosing with an average reduction in serum potassium of 
0.81 mmol/L, 1.02 mmol/L and 1.10 mmol/L at 24 (n=748), 48 (n=104) and 72 (n=28) hours, 
respectively. Normokalaemia was dependent on baseline potassium concentration, with subjects with
the highest baseline serum potassium concentrations having the most prominent decrease after starting 
the study drug but with the lowest proportion of subjects achieving normokalaemia. One hundred and 
twenty-six patients had a baseline serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L (mean baseline potassium 
6.28 mmol/L). These subjects had a mean reduction of 1.37 mmol/L at the end of the correction phase.

Note: One subject had a post-dose value that was more than 1 day after last dose. Therefore, the 
subject was eligible for the Correction Phase ITT Population; however, the time point was excluded 
from the analysis.
Normokalaemia was maintained while patients remained on drug and the mean serum potassium 
increased following discontinuation. Among those patients using RAAS inhibitors at baseline, 89% 
did not discontinue RAAS inhibitor therapy, 74% were able to maintain the same dose during the 
maintenance phase and among those not on RAAS inhibitors at baseline, 14% were able to initiate this 
therapy. During maintenance phase, 75.6% of subjects maintained normokalaemia, despite use of 
RAAS inhibitors.

Study 5
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients on chronic haemodialysis
In this study, 196 patients (mean age 58 years, range 20 to 86 years) with end stage renal disease on 
stable dialysis for at least 3 months and persistent pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia were randomised to 
receive Lokelma 5 g or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days. At randomization, mean serum 
potassium levels were 5.8 mmol/L (range 4.2-7.3 mmol/L) in the Lokelma group and 5.9 mmol/L 
(range 4.2–7.3 mmol/L) in the placebo group. To achieve pre-dialysis serum potassium level between 
4.0-5.0 mmol/L during the dose adjustment period (initial 4 weeks), the dose could be adjusted weekly 
in 5 g increments up to 15 g once daily based on pre-dialysis serum potassium measurement after the 
LIDI. The dose reached at the end of the dose-adjustment period was maintained throughout the 
subsequent 4-week evaluation period. At the end of the dose adjustment period, 37%, 43%, and 19% 
of patients were on Lokelma 5 g, 10 g and 15 g. The proportion of responders, defined as those 
subjects who maintained a pre-dialysis serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L on at least 3 out 
of 4 dialysis treatments after LIDI and who did not receive rescue therapy during the evaluation 
period, was 41% in the Lokelma group, and 1% in the placebo group (p < 0.001) (see Figure 3).
In post-hoc analyses the number of times patients had serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/L 
after the LIDI during the evaluation period was higher in the Lokelma group. 24% of patients were 
within this range at all 4 visits in the Lokelma group and none in the placebo group. The post-hoc 
analysis showed the proportion of patients who maintained serum potassium level between 3.5 and 
5.5 mmol/L on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments after LIDI during the evaluation period was 70% 
in the Lokelma group and 21% in the placebo group.
At the end of treatment, the mean post-dialysis serum potassium level was 3.6 mmol/L (range 
2.6-5.7 mmol/L) in Lokelma group and 3.9 mmol/L (range 2.2-7.3 mmol/L) in the placebo group. 
There were no differences between Lokelma and placebo groups in interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). 
IDWG was defined as pre-dialysis weight minus post-dialysis weight on the previous dialysis session 
and was measured after the LIDI.

Paediatric population
The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with 
Lokelma in one or more subsets of the paediatric population, with hyperkalaemia (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is an inorganic, insoluble compound that is not subject to enzymatic 
metabolism. In addition, clinical trials have shown it not to be systemically absorbed. An in vivo mass 
balance study in rats showed that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was recovered in the faeces with no 
evidence of systemic absorption. Due to these factors and its insolubility, no in vivo or in vitro studies 
have been performed to examine its effect on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes or transporter 
activity.
Elimination
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is eliminated via the faeces.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Lokelma is and what it is used for
Lokelma contains the active substance sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. 
Lokelma is used to treat hyperkalaemia in adults. Hyperkalaemia means that there is a high level of 
potassium in the blood.
Lokelma lowers the high levels of potassium in your body and helps to keep it at a normal level. As 
Lokelma passes through your stomach and gut it attaches to potassium and the two are carried together 
out of the body in your stools, lowering the amount of potassium in the body.
2.  What you need to know before you take Lokelma
Do not take Lokelma

If you are allergic to the active substance.
Warnings and precautions 
Monitoring
Your doctor or nurse will check your blood potassium level when you start taking this medicine:

This is to make sure you are getting the correct dose. The dose may be raised or lowered based 
on your blood potassium level.
Treatment may be stopped if your blood potassium level becomes too low.
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines which can change your blood 
potassium levels because your dose of Lokelma may need to be changed. These include
diuretics (medicines that increase urine production), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors such as enalapril, angiotensin receptor blockers such as valsartan (medicines for high
blood pressure and for heart problems), and renin inhibitors such as aliskiren (for high blood
pressure).


26
While you are taking Lokelma, tell your doctor or nurse if

you have a heart signaling disorder (QT prolongation) since Lokelma lowers your blood 
potassium levels which may affect heart signaling. 
you need to have an X-ray, as Lokelma may affect the interpretation of the results.
you have sudden or severe pain in your abdomen as this may be a sign of a problem that is 
observed with medicines that work in the gastrointestinal tract.


Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because the 
effects of Lokelma in children and adolescents are not known.
Other medicines and Lokelma
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Lokelma may affect how certain medicines are absorbed from your digestive tract. If you are taking 
any of the following medicines, they should be taken 2 hours before or after taking Lokelma, 
otherwise they may not work properly.

tacrolimus (medicines used to suppress your body’s immune system to prevent organ transplant 
rejection)
ketoconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole (used to treat fungal infections)
atazanavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, raltegravir, ledipasvir and rilpivirine
(used to treat HIV infection)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, dasatinib and nilotinib (used to treat cancer)



If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking this medicine.
Pregnancy and breast feeding
Pregnancy
Do not use this medicine during pregnancy because there is no information on its use in pregnancy.
Breast-feeding

feeding woman to Lokelma is negligible. Lokelma can be used during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.
Lokelma contains sodium
This medicine contains approximately 400 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
5 g dose. This is equivalent to 20% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for
an adult.
Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you need Lokelma 5 g or more daily for a prolonged period, 
especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.
3.  How to take Lokelma

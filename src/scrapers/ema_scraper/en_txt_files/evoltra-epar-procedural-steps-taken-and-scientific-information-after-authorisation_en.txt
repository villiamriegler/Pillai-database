In order to provide a dose recommendation in patients with 
dosing recommendation for paediatric patients with 
moderate renal impairment further to the request of 
the CHMP following the assessment of the responses 
to Specific Obligation 12 (SO2 012.7). Based on the 
population pharmacokinetic and safety analyses of 
paediatric and adult data, the MAH proposes to 
reduce the dose of Evoltra by 50% for patients with 
renal impairment, the MAH conducted a population PK 
analysis of clofarabine concentrations in adult and 
paediatric patients from 6 studies together with a safety 
analysis in patients with renal impairment following CHMP 
request. . Pharmacokinetic data indicate that clofarabine 
may accumulate in patients with decreased creatinine 
clearance. As a result of these analyses, it was concluded 
Page 10/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that paediatric patients with moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 30-<60ml/min) require a 50% dose 
reduction. For the time being no dose adjustment is 
recommended in mild renally impaired paediatric patients. 
The safety profile of clofarabine has not been established in 
patients with severe renal impairment or patients receiving 
renal replacement therapy.

The CHMP is however of the opinion that one additional

grounds is required. The grounds for one additional renewal 
are as follows: 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Evoltra 
(clofarabine) remains positive, but considers that its safety 
profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
- 
Data from the voluntary European Registry 
Programme for prescribers of clofarabine, which is a 
specific obligation of the marketing authorisation, is needed 
to further characterise the risk/benefit profile of clofarabine 
during routine clinical use for the treatment of ALL in 
paediatric patients who have relapsed or are refractory 
after receiving at least two prior regimens.  
- 
The MAH should continue to submit a yearly PSURs

Following the review of cases of renal events reported with 
of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include 
Labelling and 
Evoltra, it was concluded that some factors other than 
recommendations drawing attention to supportive 
care measures of adequate hydration, treatment of 
sepsis and hypotension, prophylactic treatment to 
mitigate risk of tumour lysis syndrome, and 
avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and drugs 
eliminated by renal secretion further to the CHMP 
PL 
Evoltra (clofarabine) could have contributed to the 
occurrence of these events. During the assessment of the 
4th PSUR, the CHMP recommended the inclusion in the SPC 
of recommendations drawing attention to supportive care 
measures of adequate hydration, treatment of sepsis (and 
hypotension, common in the setting of sepsis), prophylactic

request following the assessment of the 4th PSUR. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC were also updated to 
include information regarding enterocolitis, 
neutropaenic colitis and Clostridium difficile colitis 
further to the CHMP request following the 
assessment of the 5th PSUR. The MAH also aligned 
the safety information with the Company Core Data 
Sheet (CCDS) to include information in sections 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SPC, regarding suppression of bone 
marrow and associated haematological abnormalities 
and supportive care measures for correction of an 
anti-emetic effect of Evoltra (clofarabine). The MAH 
also took the opportunity to present post-marketing 
reports currently included in section 4.8 of the SPC 
(Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis and pancreatitis) in tabular format with a 
frequency unknown in accordance with the SPC 
guideline recommendations. In addition, the list of 
local representatives in the package leaflet was 
updated. Furthermore, editorial and linguistic 
changes have been introduced in the SPC, labelling 
and Package leaflet.

Annex II 
The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of 
compliance with the specific obligations submitted by 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder and having re-
assessed the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal 
product, recommended that no amendment of 
treatment to mitigate the risk of tumour lysis syndrome, 
together with the avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and 
drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion. Therefore, 
sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SPC have been updated. 
A cumulative safety review of neutropenic colitis identifying 
17 cases was included in the 5th PSUR. Further to the 
CHMP request following the assessment of the 5th PSUR, 
the MAH introduced information on colitis, Clostridium 
difficile colitis and related complications (e.g., ulceration, 
perforation) in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC. 
The MAH also proposed to align the SPC with the Company 
Core Data Sheet (CCDS) including suppression of bone 
marrow and related haematological abnormalities, and 
supportive care measures to correct an anti-emetic effect 
of clofarabine. In addition, the MAH proposed to replace 
existing descriptive text concerning Stevens - Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and pancreatitis with 
presenting these events in a tabular format in Section 4.8.

and minor updates of section 5.1 of the SPC in line with the

available from studies CLO212 and CLO222.  
The clinical trial patient numbers so far stated in section 
4.8 of the SPC (n=132), which included patients who 
received any dose of clofarabine, have been changed to the 
number of patients who received only the marketed dose of 
clofarabine (n=115). With reference to the indication, this 
is considered a more relevant approach. Hence, figures and 
percentages in section 4.8 of the SPC have been revised

This type II variation concerns an update of the SPC, upon 
accordingly. 
Section 4.4 of the SPC now highlights that in the event that 
a patient experiences a haematologic toxicity of Grade 4 
neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) lasting ?4 weeks, then the 
dose should be reduced by 25% for the next cycle. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
request by the CHMP following the assessment of the 3rd 
PSUR, to add information regarding veno-occlusive disease 
(VOD) in sections 4.4 and 4.8, statements on the 
occurrence of pancreatitis, Steven Johnson syndrome (SJS) 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in section 4.8, and 
further information regarding tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), 
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and 
capillary leak syndrome (CLS) in section 4.4. 
Patients should receive IV fluids throughout the 5 day 
clofarabine administration period. The use of prophylactic 
steroids (e.g., 100 mg/m2 hydrocortisone on Days 1 
through 3) may be of benefit in preventing signs or 
symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak.   
Patients who have previously received a hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be at higher risk for 
hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) 
following treatment with clofarabine (40 mg/m2) when 
used in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m2) and 
cyclophosphamide (440 mg/m2).  Severe hepatotoxic 
events have been reported in an ongoing Phase 1/2 
combination study of clofarabine in paediatric patients with 
relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia. Two paediatric

reports (1,7%) of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) were 
considered related to study drug. 
Uncommon occurrences of Stevens Johnson Syndrome 
(SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been 
reported in patients treated with clofarabine. 
Occurrences of pancreatitis and/or elevations in serum 
amylase and lipase have been reported during clofarabine 
treatment.

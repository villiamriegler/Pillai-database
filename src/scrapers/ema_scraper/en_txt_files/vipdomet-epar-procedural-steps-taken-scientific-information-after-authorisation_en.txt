SmPC and PL 
to add a new warning on Vitamin B12 decrease or 
deficiency and to update the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) in accordance with the recent 
update of the PI for Glucophage, which is the 
reference label for the compound metformin, and 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

designed to demonstrate that no excess risk of a major 
adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) exists following 
Page 11/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment with alogliptin compared with placebo when 
added to standard of care in adults with type II diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), are 
included in the SmPC. The primary endpoint of the study 
was achieved, demonstrating non-inferiority of alogliptin 
compared with placebo for the primary MACE composite. 
Therefore, in general, alogliptin was not associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
The WSA proposed the update of sections 4.4, 4.8, 
and 5.1 of the SmPC and in order to reflect the 
results of study 402, a phase 3b, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study, 
designed to demonstrate that no excess risk of a 
major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) exists 
following treatment with alogliptin compared with 
placebo when added to standard of care in adults 
with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS). 
The MAH took this opportunity to propose 
amendments to the RMP in order to reflect results 
from study 402 and to update its structure according 
to the new European Union (EU) template for RMPs.

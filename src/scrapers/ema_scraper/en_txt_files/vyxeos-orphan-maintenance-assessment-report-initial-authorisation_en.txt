2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2011 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
acute myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
not more than 1.2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made;  
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to several consequences of the 
bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that liposomal combination of cytarabine and 
daunorubicin may be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. This appears justified 
in particular with regards to a potential clinically relevant advantage based on the combination of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin at a ratio of 1 to 5 in liposomes over the standard of care. This is 
based on preliminary clinical data. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disease characterised by rapid, uncontrolled proliferation of 
malignant clonal haematopoietic stem cells that accumulate as immature, undifferentiated cells 
(blasts) and lead to impaired production of normal haematopoietic elements, which in turn leads to 
anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The COMP continues to accept AML as orphan condition 
for designation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Vyxeos is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly 
diagnosed, therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related 
changes (AML-MRC)” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “Treatment of acute 
myeloid leukaemia”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition was presented by the sponsor to be chronically debilitating due to neutropenia, anaemia, 
and thrombocytopenia. Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of fatigue, weakness, 
haemorrhage, and infection resulting from reductions in red blood cells, platelets or white blood cells. 
AML was also presented to be life threatening with survival being mainly dependent on the stage 
(initial diagnosis/first-line vs. relapsed or refractory/second-line and later treatment) and karyotype of 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/496701/2018 
Page 4/10 
 
the disease. If untreated, patients may die of infections, complications of infections (e.g. sepsis and 
multisystem organ failure), or bleeding events (typically central nervous system, respiratory, or 
gastrointestinal bleeding). 
The COMP concluded that the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the 
consequences of bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic 
episodes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition 
progresses rapidly and is fatal within a few months if left untreated. Despite the availability of 
satisfactory methods of treatment, the overall 5-year relative survival with the currently available 
treatments is approximately 22%. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
A systematic literature search was conducted to identify epidemiological literature sources. 
Furthermore, epidemiological data from national registry databases and pan-European databases have 
been identified. Prevalence figures of AML and its subpopulations have been pooled from the major 
European registries (table 1). For countries, where there is insufficient data available, figures were 
estimated based on the EU28 5-year prevalence figure, which was extrapolated for 3 and 10-year 
prevalence based on registry data. Using crude rates from the incidence data a prevalence figure for 
each country were determined. The 10-year prevalence figures range up to 1 per 10,000. Based on the 
presented data a prevalence of approximately 1 per 10,000 was considered to be most representative 
prevalence figure.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The following products were identified to be authorised for the treatment of the orphan condition: 
histamine dihydrochloride, decitabine, azacitidine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, 
cytarabine (Ara-C), thioguanine, L-asparaginase, doxorubicin, vincristine sulphate, cyclophosphamide.  
Rydapt (midostaurin) has been authorised in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine 
induction and high dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in complete response 
followed by Rydapt single agent maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are FLT3 mutation positive.  
Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) has recently been authorised and is indicated for combination 
therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and 
above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). 
The COMP also took into consideration the current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
treatment guideline from Fey and Buske 2013 discussing the current treatment options for AML in 
adult patients (Ann Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6): vi138-vi143).  
Significant benefit 
Significant benefit needs to be demonstrated in adults with newly diagnosed, therapy-related acute 
myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). In this context 
the ESMO guideline outlines that for intensive treatment of non-APL AML induction should include an 
anthracycline (daunorubicin) and cytarabine (Ara-C) with the particularly well-known and time-
honoured ‘3+7’ regimen. Furthermore, consolidation therapy in AML is warranted once patients have 
reached clinical and haematological remission. Taking into consideration the ESMO guideline and the 
authorisation status of medicinal products in AML, it was considered that significant benefit would need 
to be established versus standard induction chemotherapy consisting of anthracyclines and cytarabine. 
It was acknowledged that Vyxeos is authorised to substitute the traditional standard induction 
chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine without reference to other therapies that are used in 
combination in the first line. A demonstration of significant benefit over midostaurin (Rydapt) and 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), which are currently authorised to be used in combination with 
traditional induction chemotherapy, was therefore not required. Furthermore, significant benefit over 
first line therapies in non-intensive treatments and treatments authorised in the relapsed/refractory 
setting was not deemed necessay.  
Significant benefit versus the induction therapy anthracycline (daunorubicin) and cytarabine (Ara-C) 
was supported by data collected from clinical trial CLTR0310-301. This clinical trial was assessed as 
pivotal evidence by the CHMP (please also refer to the EPAR of Vyxeos). It was a phase III, 
multicenter, randomised trial of Vyxeos liposome injection (also called CPX-351) versus cytarabine and 
daunorubicin in patients 60 -75 years of age with untreated high risk (secondary) AML study. The 
primary objective was to confirm the efficacy of Vyxeos compared with 7+3 as first line therapy in 
elderly patients (60 to 75 years old) with high risk (secondary) AML with the primary endpoint overall 
survival (OS) defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Both arms in the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
EMA/496701/2018 
Page 7/10 
 
pivotal study were balanced with regards to baseline demography and disease characteristics. A 
significant improvement of 3.6 months in OS with Vyxeos compared to the 7+3 standard treatment 
has been demonstrated in the ITT population (figure 1 and table 3, median OS 9.56 months vs 5.95 
months; HR = 0.69, 95% CI : 0.52 to 0.90, 1-sided p = 0.003). The CHMP deemed this to be a 
clinically relevant effect. 
Table 3.  Overall Survival (ITT Analysis Population-Study CLTR0310-301) 
Figure 1.  Kaplan-Meier Curve for overall survival (ITT population- Study CLTR0310-301) 
The number and percentage of subjects transferred for HSCT after induction were measured as 
secondary endpoint. More patients in the Vyxeos treatment group received a HSCT in CR or CRi 
compared with patients in CR or CRi for the 7+3 regimen (table 4, 54.8% vs. 46.2%, respectively). A 
Kaplan-Meier analysis of the 91 subjects who received a transplant landmarked at the time of  
transplant showed that subjects in the Vyxeos group performed better than those in the control 
(HR=0.46, p = 0.009 [1-sided]). The median survival was not reached in the Vyxeos treatment group, 
whereas the median survival in the 7+3 treatment group was 10.25 months.

Taking into consideration the clinical data submitted to the COMP and the CHMP assessment of the 
benefit-risk, the COMP established significant benefit of Vyxeos based on a clinically relevant 
advantage over current standard ‘3+7’ chemotherapy induction chemotherapy regimen with cytarabine 
and daunorubicin.

4.  COMP position adopted on 02 July 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of acute myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was  
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 1 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of bone 
marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition progresses rapidly and is 
fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated. The overall 5-year relative survival 
with the currently available treatments is approximately 22%; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, Vyxeos is of significant benefit to adults with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia as defined 
by therapy-related AML  or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. It was demonstrated that 
treatment with Vyxeos led to improved overall survival when compared to the currently authorised 
induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine which is standard of care treatment in 
newly diagnosed patients. There was also an increased rate of haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation observed, which has curative potential. The Committee concluded that this 
constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Vyxeos, liposomal combination 
of cytarabine and daunorubicin, daunorubicin / cytarabine, EU/3/11/942 for treatment of acute myeloid 
leukaemia is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

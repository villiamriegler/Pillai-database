Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for 'tolvaptan (indicated for adults with 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as 
follows:  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder is requested to update the product information to add ‘Gout’ as a 
common adverse event in section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and in section 4 of 
the Patient Information Leaflet (PL). This is not a new signal. The SmPC already describes in section 4.4 
how tolvaptan is known to decrease uric acid clearance in the kidney, and in clinical trials this resulted in 
higher rates of clinically significant uric acid levels (greater than 10mg/dL) with tolvaptan compared to 
placebo (6.2% vs 1.7%). Adverse reactions of gout were reported more frequently with tolvaptan than 
with placebo (2.9% vs 1.4%). The PL currently warns in section 2 that patients should talk to their doctor 
if they have previously had high level of uric acid which may have caused gout attacks. The recommended 
updates are to make the distinction that hyperuricaemia and gout are different clinical entities, and that 
hyperuricaemia may be asymptomatic. The term ‘gout’ is also more easily understood by patients.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for 'tolvaptan (indicated for adults with autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the 
medicinal product(s) containing 'tolvaptan (indicated for adults with autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD)) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The company Hoechst AG, Germany submitted on 29 November 1995 to the European Agency 
for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA)  an  application  to  obtain  a  Marketing 
Authorisation in accordance with the Centralised Procedure for the medicinal product Insuman 
(Human insulin) falling within the scope of Part A of the Annex to Council Regulation No (EC) 
2309/93 of 22 July 1993. 
The  Rapporteur’s  initial  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  members  of  the  CPMP  on  
7 February 1996. The Co-Rapporteur’s initial assessment report was circulated to all members 
of the CPMP on 9 February 1996. 
During the February CPMP meeting, the Rapporteur requested a clarification of the trade name 
issue since semi-synthetic human insulin of porcine origin from the same company is already on 
the market in several Member States.  
The  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of  questions  to  be  sent  to  the  applicant  on  
13 March 1996. 
The applicant submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 15 August 1996.  
The assessment of the responses was circulated to all CPMP members on 12 September 1996. 
The applicant provided additional information on 27 September 1996. 
Rapporteur's summary of the additional information provided by the company was circulated on 
2 October 1996. 
On  11  October  1996  the  company  submitted  additional  information  regarding  the  operation 
conditions.  Furthermore,  the  company  committed  to  a  procedure  for  launch  of  Insuman 
(recombinant  human  insulin)  in  view  of  insulin  products  from  porcine  origin  with  the  same 
tradename.

The CPMP, during the meeting 14-16 October 1996, discussed whether it would be necessary to 
distinguish between the two different strengths or six different formulations by using a different 
colour.  The  company  confirmed  that  they  will  differentiate  Insuman  preparations  by  different 
colour codes and where there are different strengths of the same type of insulin, the 100 IU/ml 
strength will have the full colour bar, but the 40 IU/ml strength will have a striped version of the 
bar in the same colour. 
The  CPMP  in  the  light  of  current  scientific  standards  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a 
Marketing Authorisation to the different human insulin formulations on 16 October 1996. 
The Marketing Authorisation for Insuman was granted on 21 February 1997.

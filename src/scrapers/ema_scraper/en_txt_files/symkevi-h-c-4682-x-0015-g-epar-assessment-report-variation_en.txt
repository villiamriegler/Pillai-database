2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and 
water absorption and secretion.  
The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem pathology 
associated with CF. In patients with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein 
result in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic 
function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride 
concentration.  
The biochemical defect of defective chloride channel function is present from birth, with the sequelae of 
lung, pancreatic and other organ involvement emerging progressively throughout childhood and into 
adulthood.  
The CFTR phenotype differs considerably among patients, even among patients with the same 
genotype. The CFTR genotype primarily determines the degree of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, 
sweat chloride concentration and malformation of the male reproductive tract.  
However, factors independent of CFTR are responsible for variation in lung disease, the primary cause 
of morbidity and mortality in CF. In lung disease, environmental factors, socio-economic factors and 
the presence of modifier genes play an important role. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity 
and mortality in people with CF.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CF affects approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States (US) and 32,000 in the EU. The 
incidence and prevalence of CF vary between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the 
Caucasian populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations.  
The most common mutation is the F508 del mutation. About 50% of the CF population is homozygous 
for the F508 del mutation, while this allele is present in at least 70% of the overall CF population. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene 
have been identified; the F508 is the most frequent allele.  
These mutations can be classified (a) according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR 
function or (b) by the extent of loss of chloride transport caused by the mutation.  
•  Classification by the disruption of the CFTR function  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 8/120 
 
 
 
Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR; class II mutations consist of 
aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while class III 
mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of CFTR 
function. These three classes usually lead to minimal function of the CFTR protein and a classic CF 
phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency.  
CFTR mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V 
mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. 
These mutations often lead to a reduced function of the CFTR protein and these patients have often a 
less severe form of CF.  
•  Classification by means of the extent of loss of chloride transport 
CF-causing mutations can also be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride 
transport caused by the mutation. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is 
referred to as “minimal function” of CFTR. A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport is 
referred to as “residual function” of CFTR. Patients with a more severe loss of CFTR may have more 
severe CF.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508Del-CFTR) and it is a Class II mutation: it 
prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride 
transport. The decrease in the amount of F508Del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in the 
processing and trafficking of the F508Del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508Del-CFTR 
protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating and a decreased stability at the 
cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508Del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at 
the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease. Some patients are severely 
affected at birth, while others become symptomatic at a later age.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The median predicted survival for CF patients in the United States was 39.3 years (95% CI, 37.3-41.4) 
according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 2014 Registry Report.  
The classic or typical form of CF is diagnosed if a patient demonstrates clinical disease in one or more 
organ systems and has elevated sweat chloride (≥60 mmol/L). Most of these patients have disease 
manifestations in multiple organ systems (pancreas, upper and lower respiratory tract, and male 
reproductive tract).  
The prevalence of certain CF complications varies according to the age group. Exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency is often already present from birth or develops in infancy. CF-related liver cirrhosis 
clinically presents most frequently between the ages of 5 to 15 years, but with a lower frequency in the 
third decade. CF-related pulmonary disease mostly starts in childhood. The disease manifestations are 
regarded as the results of the long-standings defect of the CFTR function. CF-related diabetes often 
starts to develop in patients around the age of 10 years and may progress in severity over years to 
insulin dependency. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. 
The natural course of lung disease in CF is shown in Figure 1. In CF, the early lung damage starts in 
the peripheral, small airways due to the long-standing inflammation caused by the defect CFTR 
channel. This early deterioration of the small airways results in ventilation inhomogeneity. The 
ventilation inhomogeneity can be measured by the lung clearance index. Upon progression of the 
disease, also the larger airways will become affected. These larger airways abnormalities can be more 
easily measured by the FEV1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 9/120 
 
 
 
Indeed, in children, the lung function as judged by the FEV1 is often preserved, but peripheral airways 
disease is shown by an abnormal Lung clearance index (LCI). The deterioration of LCI reflects disease 
progression. The LCI 2.5 correlates well with FEV1, although it is abnormal at an earlier stage in the 
disease. Therefore, the LCI can be used to measure airways disease in CF children, although the 
minimal clinically important difference is not known. The lung function as measured by FEV1 is often 
preserved until adolescence. During adolescence, the lung function also starts to decline as measured 
by FEV1. Most adults with CF have either moderate or severe lung disease as measured by an impaired 
FEV1.  
Figure 1 The natural course of progression of the pulmonary CF 
CF is included in many newborn screening programs. More than 80% of patients with CF are diagnosed 
by age 3. Genotyping for mutations in the CFTR gene is now routine practice in many countries, and 
90% of patients in the EU are genotyped. During the years, the prognosis of CF has been improved, 
which is partly due to early recognising and early intervention.  
In the 1950s, many patients died before the age of 5, while currently, many patients reach adulthood. 
The current life expectancy is > 30 years. The ageing of the CF population has brought a paradigm 
shift in outlook in the adult healthcare sector, from a focus on the care of lung disease to the 
management of a complex multi-system chronic illness, including the care for diabetes, renal function, 
osteoporosis, and hepatic function.  
There is a wide spectrum of severity in CF, even among patients who harbour the same mutations. 
Some patients are severely affected, with symptoms already present at birth (meconium ileus). Most 
patients develop symptoms during childhood, while some patients may only demonstrate mild or 
atypical symptoms in adulthood. Usually, patients with Type I-III mutations are more severely affected 
than those with ≥ type 4 mutations.  
2.1.5.  Management 
CF medications range from CFTR modulators and enzyme supplements to mucolytics, antibiotics, and 
vitamins. The treatment is aimed to reduce symptoms and prevent possible long-term detrimental side 
effect due to the long-standing inflammation and infections.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 10/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most treatments are symptomatic, but the CFTR modulators may improve CFTR function, which is 
believed to be the primary cause of disease. Current treatment guidelines recommend CFTR modulator 
and non-modulator medications concomitantly administered to maintain and improve lung function, 
reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and improve quality of life. 
CFTR protein, increasing surface expression, in class II mutation while potentiators recover the 
function of the CFTR protein at the apical surface of epithelial cells, to allow more chloride to flow 
through and reduce the symptoms of CF. 
However, there is an inter-dependence between channel gating and cellular processing given that each 
depends on CFTR protein folding; thus a sharp distinction between a potentiator and corrector might 
be somewhat artificial. 
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) are the only CFTR modulators 
approved for CF patients with specific mutations in children aged 6-11 years. Ivacaftor (in Kalydeco as 
mono-component and in Orkambi as part of a fixed-dose combination) is a potentiator; the active 
substance lumacaftor is a corrector (present in the fixed-dose combination Orkambi). Clinical efficacy 
of ivacaftor monotherapy has been established in Class III mutations that cause defects in channel 
gating as well as in the Class III/IV mutation R117H. Clinical efficacy of the combination of lumacaftor 
and ivacaftor has been established in patients homozygous for the F508Del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
However, some patients are not able to tolerate treatment with LUM/IVA due to respiratory events 
related to off-target effects of the lumacaftor component. In addition, lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A 
inducer, and some patients may not take it because of the drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Extension of the TEZ/IVA indication in combination with IVA to patients 6 through 11 years old would 
provide an alternative treatment option for F/F patients. Currently, there are no CFTR modulators 
approved in children aged 6-11 with an F/RF mutation. Symkevi would fulfil an unmet medical need for 
these patients.  
About the product 
Symkevi belongs to the pharmaco-therapeutic group of ‘Other respiratory system products’; ATC code: 
R07AX31. 
Symkevi is a fixed-dose combination containing two substances, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, that work by 
improving activity of CFTR in the lungs, which is necessary to produce thin, normal mucus. Tezacaftor 
is a CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal or multiple mutant 
forms of CFTR (including F508Del-CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to 
the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that 
potentiates the channel-open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride 
transport. Together, tezacaftor and ivacator aim to restore the basic functional defect that cause the 
disease manifestations of CF.  
For ivacaftor to function, CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the 
CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, leading to a further enhancement of chloride 
transport than either agent does alone. The combined effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased 
quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport, airway 
surface liquid height, and ciliary beat frequency (

Figure 2 Mechanism of action of tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Potentiators and correctors improve lung function by improving CFTR-function. The relation between 
the improvement in CFTR function and lung function is complex, because in CF, the deterioration of the 
lung function is not only determined by the CFTR-function, but also by modifier genes and 
environmental factors. Considering that the basic pathophysiologic effect between adults and children 
is comparable, the proposed effect size in lung function improvement that could be attributable to the 
improvement in CFTR function might be comparable. 
Previous studies showed that the potentiation of the CFTR function might be a predictive 
pharmacodynamic biomarker of lung function changes on a population bases but might be unsuitable 
for the prediction of treatment benefits on an individual level [FIDLER, 20171]. 
Currently, Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the 
treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The application consists of results from quality and clinical studies. The clinical programme for children 
aged 6 through 11 years is based on the partial extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children, 
supported by PK/safety study VX15-661-113 and pivotal phase 3 parallel-group trial VX16-661-115 in 
54 patients aged 6-11 years. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablets containing 50 mg of tezacaftor and 75 mg of 
ivacaftor as active substances. 
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: hypromellose acetate succinate, sodium laurilsulfate (E487), hypromellose 2910 (E464), 
microcrystalline cellulose (E460(i)), croscarmellose sodium (E468), magnesium stearate (E470b), 
Tablet film-coat: hypromellose 2910 (E464, hydroxypropyl cellulose (E463), titanium dioxide (E171), 
talc (E553b) 
The product is available in a blister consisting of PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene)/PVC (polyvinyl 
chloride) with a paper-backed aluminium foil lidding as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substances 
The active substances (tezacaftor and ivacaftor) are the same as for the authorised Symkevi 100 mg 
tezacaftor/150 mg ivacaftor film-coated tablets. No new information on the active substances has been 
provided within this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film-coated tablet for oral administration. The tablet is a 
fixed dose combination (FDC) of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The tablet contains 50 mg of tezacaftor and 
75 mg of ivacaftor and has a total target weight of 304.82 mg. It is a white, capsule-shaped tablet, 
debossed with “V50” on one side and plain on the other (dimensions 12.70 mm x 6.78 mm). The 
qualitative and quantitative composition of the product is presented. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The aim of the formulation development was to manufacture an additional age-appropriate film-coated 
tablet strength needed for the extension of the indication to children from 6-12 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 14/120 
 
 
 
 
The formulation development was mainly based on the 100 mg/150 mg product strength. The 50 
mg/75 mg tablet uses the same core tablet blend formulation as the 100 mg/150 mg tablet, and the 
tablet weight is adjusted to achieve the desired dose. The tablet is coated with a white, non-functional 
film-coat containing the same components as the film coating used for the 100 mg/150 mg tablet. The 
only difference is that the film coating formulation used for the 50 mg/75 mg does not contain yellow 
iron oxide as colourant. 
The two tablet strengths are sufficiently visually distinguishable by their size, debossing and colour. 
The two active substances, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, are incorporated into the FDC tablet as amorphous 
spray dried dispersions (SDDs). This is the same approach used for the existing 100 mg/150 mg 
tablet.  
Comparative dissolution results using the quality control (QC) methods for ivacaftor and tezacaftor 
(which are identical for both product strengths) show similar release profiles for the 50 mg/75 mg 
clinical batches versus the 100 mg/150 mg clinical batches.   
Overall, the proposed tablet formulation is considered suitable for children aged 6 years and above. An 
adequate general discussion on the suitability of the finished product for use in children of 6-12 years 
has been provided in the dossier in accordance with the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of 
medicines for paediatric use. The tablets need to be swallowed whole and should not be chewed, 
crushed or broken before swallowing as clinical data is currently not available to support these 
methods of administration (SmPC 4.2). The acceptability of the formulation was evaluated as part of 
the clinical studies where tablets were overall well accepted, and the majority of patients found the 
tablets easy to swallow. 
The product was developed following an enhanced QbD approach as per ICH Q8. The development was 
largely based on pre-existing knowledge from the authorised 100 mg/150 mg strength. The 
manufacturing process development of the 50 mg/75 mg product and development studies performed 
were guided by an initial risk assessment where the potential impact of material attributes and process 
steps on the critical quality attributes of the product. The finished product CQAs are appearance, 
identification, assay, degradation products, dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, physical form, 
microbial limits, elemental impurities and residual solvents. 
The manufacturing principles of the 50 mg/75 mg tablet are the same as for the authorised 100 
mg/150 mg tablets. However, the 50 mg/75 mg tablets are manufactured using a traditional batch 
process, whereas the 100 mg/150 mg tablets are manufactured using a continuous manufacturing 
process, with different equipment types and capacities. The input materials are the same for both 
processes, including the tezacaftor and ivacaftor SDD components. No development data or dossier 
sections have been provided for the tezacaftor SDD and ivacaftor SDD components, but this is 
acceptable as these have already been approved for the authorised 100 mg/150 mg strength and are 
included in the dossier. 
Due to potential interactions between material attributes of ivacaftor SDD and process parameters, 
these were studied inDoE.model confirmation runs were then conducted to confirm the accuracy of the 
resulting process models and to demonstrate process performance on commercial scale equipment. 
Based on the outcome of the DoE study, a design space was established for the dry granulation and 
compression steps. The design space is acceptable.   
A second DoEwas also executed. No critical process parameters were identified, and no design space 
was established for the coatingprocess.  
The batches used in the clinical studies were manufactured according to the finalized manufacturing 
process and composition and are representative for the commercial product.

The primary packaging is the same as for the existing 100 mg/150 mg tablets. It is a blister consisting 
of PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene)/PVC (polyvinyl chloride) with a paper backed aluminium foil 
lidding. The components comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. The choice of the 
container closure system is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The 50 mg/75 mg tablets are manufactured by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., United States using a batch 
manufacturing process which includes weighing, sieving and intragranular blending of the active SDDs 
with excipients, dry granulation and milling, extragranular blending and lubrication, compression, and 
film  coating.  These  are  the  same  manufacturing  unit  operations  used  for  the  manufacture  the  100 
mg/150 mg FDC tablets. The manufacturing process is a standard process.  
An adequate criticality analysis was performed as part of the pharmaceutical development. Sufficient 
information on the control of critical steps has been provided in the dossier and the in-process 
acceptance limits have been justified. Compression force was identified as acritical process parameter. 
A design space is claimed for the compression stage of the process, which is justified. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed design space. 
The overall control strategy, process parameters and in-process controls seem adequate in view of the 
available development data and in view of the standard nature of the manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process was validated on six batches at a commercial manufacturing scale (three 
batches of 30 kg and three batches of 40 kg). Actual validation reports have only been provided for the 
three 40 kg batch, but this is considered acceptable in view of the standard nature of the 
manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual), identification (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of 
dosage units (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), water content (KF), physical form (XRPD) and microbiological 
quality (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli). The release and shelf-life specifications are identical, except for the test 
for water content, which is only performed at release.  
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are both stable molecules. No degradation products have been observed at or 
above the reporting threshold (0.10% w/w) in representative lots of 50 mg tezacaftor/75 mg ivacaftor 
FDC tablets at release or on stability.  
Water content is determined at release only. Water is not a critical quality attribute (CQA) of the 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets since it has no impact on chemical and physical stability of the tablet. 
However, the release water specification will assure the tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets will have a 
water activity below 0.60, and not support microbial growth. Water content is not monitored on 
stability since microbial count, the only CQA that could be impacted by water, is tested directly. 
Residual solvents are omitted from the FDC tablets specification since they are controlled in at the level 
of tezacaftor and ivacaftor active substances and SDDs, and the tablet excipients. These controls 
ensure the total potential residual solvent content of tezacaftor/ivacaftor FDC tablets comply with the 
ICH Q3C (R6) requirements.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The risk assessment of 
the content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities (as defined in ICH Q3D) in the tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor active substances and SDDs demonstrated that the risk of elemental impurities in these 
materials is low. Confirmatory testing of representative batches including at least three commercial 
batches of each active substance and SDD from each supplier confirmed that the content of Class 1 
and Class 2A elemental impurities is consistently below 30% of the ICH Q3D Option 1 limits. The 
content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities were also shown to be below the ICH Q3D Option 
1 limits for all tablet excipients except for lead (Pb) in the Opadry film coating excipient. However, 
using Option 2b, the maximum daily exposure of lead was shown to be significantly below 30% of its 
established permitted daily exposure (PDE) due to the low proportion of this component in the finished 
product. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical procedures for the 50 mg/75 mg product are identical to those authorised for the 100 
mg/150 mg product, with only some slight differences with regards to the sample preparation, where 
needed, to accommodate for the difference in strength. The methods have been described in sufficient 
detail and were adequately validated where relevant. The reference standards are the same as used 
for the 100 mg/150 mg product. 
Batch analysis results have been provided on three batches with a batch size of 30.0 kg (clinical 
batches) and three commercial batches of the maximum production scale of 40.0 kg, demonstrating 
consistent results and compliance with the finished product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 °C/75% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The stability batches of Symkevi 50 mg/75 mg tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, physical 
form, microbiological quality and water activity (Ph. Eur). Except for a consistent increase in water 
content, the stability data showed no clear trends or changes in any of the tested parameters at all 
three storage conditions. All results were within the specification limits.  
The available stability data from data from the existing 100 mg/150 mg tablets which have an 
approved shelf life of 4 years were used as supportive data. This was considered acceptable since, as 
indicated above, both tablet strengths have the same qualitative composition, with the exception of 
iron oxide yellow which is present only in the 100 mg /150 mg tablets film coat. In addition, both 
tablets strengths are manufactured using the same blend, dry granulation manufacturing process, film 
coating components (except for the yellow iron oxide) and use the same container closure system.  
In addition, one pilot scale batch was exposed to light as per as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Samples were tested for appearance, 
assay and degradation products. The data showed no changes in the fully exposed test sample and the 
covered control, confirming that tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets do not require light protective packaging.

Forced degradation studies have not been separately performed for the 50 mg/75 mg product, but only 
for the 100 mg/150 mg product. The results of these studies are considered representative by the for 
the 50 mg/75 mg tablets. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years without any special storage 
requirements when packed in PCTFE/PVC-Al blisters as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The development of the 50 mg/75 mg tablet strength was largely based on pre-existing knowledge 
from the authorised 100 mg/150 mg tablets. Information on development, manufacture and control of 
the finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. A design space has been proposed for the compression step in the 
manufacture of the finished product. The design space has been adequately verified.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical studies have been submitted in this application which is acceptable. No ERA was 
submitted which can be accepted taking into account the impact in the new population. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The TEZ/IVA clinical package supporting the approved indication in patients ≥ 12 years (i.e. 
adolescents and adults) comprises 5 clinical studies in total: two 2 dose-finding studies (study VX11-
661-101 and VX13-661-103), two placebo-controlled phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (Study VX14-
661-106 and VX14-661-108) and one long term open-label study evaluating safety and efficacy (VX14-
661-110). 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 18/120 
 
 
 
The phase III Studies 106 and 108 were the key efficacy studies supporting the adult indication. Study 
106 was a randomised controlled (RCT), placebo-controlled parallel study of 24 weeks duration in 
patients homozygous for F508Del (F/F); Study 108: RCT parallel-group study in patients heterozygous 
for F508Del and a residual function mutation (F/RF) [ EMEA/H/C/004682/0000]. 
In this application, the Applicant submitted the clinical studies VX15-661-113 and Study VX16-661-115 
to provide the bridge for the extrapolation of the efficacy and safety of patients ≥12 years to the 
children aged 6-11 years to support this extension of the indication. 
Study VX15-661-113 (Study 113) is a 2-part open-label study designed to evaluate TEZ/IVA 
pharmacokinetics (PK) in Part A (Study 113A) and 24-week safety in Part B (Study 113B) in children 6 
through 11 years of age with cystic fibrosis, homozygous or heterozygous for the F508Del –CFTR 
mutation.  
Study 113 Part A is included in the TEZ/IVA EMEA-001640-PIP01-14-M04;  
Study VX16-661-115 (Study 115) is phase 3, double blinded, parallel group study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA in patients 6 through 11 years of age with CF, with an F/F or F/RF 
genotype (8-week duration). Patients will be stratified by genotype and randomized in a 4:1 ratio to 
either the TEZ/IVA group or the appropriate blinding group for their genotype. The F/F blinding group 
received placebo and the F/RF blinding group received IVA monotherapy. 
Study 115 was conducted in Europe and Australia and is included in the TEZ/IVA EMEA-001640-PIP01-
14-M04; Study 12. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No specific PK study was submitted. However, a phase 3 study included two parts one related to PK 
analysis. (Part A). This study is described below 
Study VX15-661-113, a Phase 3, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Tolerability of VX-661 in Combination with Ivacaftor in Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of Age With Cystic 
Fibrosis, Homozygous or Heterozygous for the F508Del-CFTR Mutation. 
Methods 
Study design 
Study 113 is a 2-part (Part A and Part B), open-label, multicentre study.  
Part 113A 
Part 113 A included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (14 days) and a Wash-out/Safety 
Follow-up Period (14 days) to evaluate off-drug response. Subjects were enrolled into 2 weight-based 
cohorts with a cut of value of 25 kg (Figure 3).  
Figure 3 Schematic of Study Design for Study 113 Part A  
Part 113B included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (24 weeks [± 5 days]), and 
Safety Follow-up Visit (4 weeks [± 7 days]) (see Figure 15). 
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data was completed by an internal Vertex team after completion 
of Part A to select the TEZ/IVA dose regimens for Part B. Based on this review the dosing scheme was 
altered. The cut of value for dosing was raised to 40 kg, and the TEZ dose of the high dosing regimen 
was increased. No dose adjustments were made throughout the duration of treatment of Part B 
The following doses were provided during part B:  
• 
• 
Patients <40 kg: TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients ≥40 kg: TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h 
Study participants 
Patients aged 6-11 years with a confirmed diagnosis of CF and an eligible CFTR genotype. The 
Genotype was confirmed at the screening visit. Patients homozygous for F508/F508 were eligible for 
both parts of the study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 21/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heterozygous patients were eligible for Part A of the study if they had a second CFTR allele that met at 
least one of the following criteria: 
1. mutation was predicted to have residual function  
2. the mutation causes a gating defect that has been clinically demonstrated to be IVA-
responsive or  
3. the mutation was not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy 
For heterozygous patients with a mutation that was either predicted to have residual function or was 
an IVA-responsive gating mutation, the CF diagnosis was confirmed if the sweat chloride was ≥ 60 
mmol/l. If the sweat chloride was < 60 mmol, the patients must have an additional chronic 
sinopulmonary disease and/or gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities associated with CF.  
Patients with a history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an 
additional safety risk (e.g., cirrhosis with portal hypertension, risk factors for Torsades de Pointes) 
were excluded from participation. Patients with protocol-defined laboratory values indicative of 
clinically significant abnormal liver or renal function were also excluded (either (a) any 2 or more of ≥

Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Part A and Part B: Plasma PK parameters of TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA 
Efficacy Assessments 
Part B: Spirometry, weight and weight z-score, height and height z-score, BMI and BMI z-score, sweat 
chloride, and CFQ-R 
Safety Assessments 
Part A and Part B: Adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, haematology, 
coagulation studies, lipids, vitamins, and urinalysis), standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse 
oximetry, physical examinations (PEs), and spirometry. 
Part B: Ophthalmologic examinations, Lung clearance index measured by MBW (optional exploratory 
sub study conducted at a subset of sites). 
Note: Lung clearance optional sub study to evaluate an MBW device and over-reading process that 
were new to the Vertex CF program. Additional analysis of LCI results is ongoing and may be 
presented in an additional report. 
Sample size 
Approximately 16 subjects (approximately 8 subjects in each cohort) were planned for enrolment in 
Part A. 
Statistical Methods 
Sample Size and Power 
Part A 
Sample size calculations were conducted to estimate the precision in determining TEZ clearance in 
paediatric subjects in the 2 weight-based cohorts. The method used non-compartmental analysis 
(NCA)-based PK parameters, such as clearance and volume, in adults with the assumption that there 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 24/120 
 
 
 
 
would be similar variability in clearance in adults and paediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age 
within each weight group. The calculations indicated that data from 8 subjects would allow 80% power 
to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean (geo mean) estimate of clearance for 
TEZ in each paediatric subgroup (cohort). Therefore, approximately 16 subjects (approximately 8 
subjects in each cohort) were planned for enrolment in Part A. 
Part B 
Planned enrolment was approximately 56 subjects. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately 
50 subjects were expected to complete Part B. With a total sample size of 50 subjects completing the 
study, there would be a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate 
were 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate were 
10%. These probabilities were calculated by assuming a binomial distribution for the number of AEs. 
Analysis Sets 
• 
Part A 
The following analysis sets are defined: Part A - All Subjects Set and Part A - Safety Set. Assignment of 
subjects to analysis sets was performed prior to the data-cut for the IA following completion of Part A. 
The Part A - All Subjects Set is defined as subjects who consented to Part A of the study or received at 
least 1 dose of study drug in Part A of the study. 
The Part A - Safety Set is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A of 
the study. 
• 
Part B 
The Part B - Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B 
of the study. 
The Part B FAS was defined as all subjects who carried the intended CFTR mutations and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug in Part B of the study. The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses except for 
LCI endpoints. 
The Part B FAS - LCI substudy was defined as all subjects who carried the intended CFTR mutations 
and received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B of the study and had at least 1 LCI measurement. 
The FAS-LCI substudy was used for efficacy analyses of exploratory LCI endpoints. 
Variables 
Definition of Treatment-emergent Period 
• 
Part A 
The treatment-emergent (TE) period for Part A corresponds to data from the first dose of study drug in 
Part A to the Safety Follow-up Visit in Part A, or 14 days after the last dose in Part A for subjects who 
did not have a Safety Follow-up Visit. 
• 
Part B 
The treatment-emergent period for Part B corresponds to data from the first dose of study drug to 28 
days after the last dose of the study drug, or to the date of completion of study participation, 
whichever occurred first. Completion of study participation was defined as one of the following: 
• 
For subjects who completed Part B and enrolled in the extension study within 28 days of the 
Week 24 Visit: the last participation date  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 25/120 
 
 
 
• 
For subjects who completed Part B and did not enroll in the extension study within 28 days of 
the Week 24 Visit: the Safety Follow up Visit 
• 
For subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment, but did not withdraw 
consent: the latest of ETT Visit, or Safety Follow up Visit (if required) 
• 
For subjects who withdrew consent: date of withdrawal of consent 
Definition of Baseline 
Part A baseline: Baseline for Part A was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement 
(scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part A. For ECGs, baseline 
values were the average of the 3 pre-treatment measurements on Day 1 of Part A. 
Part B baseline: Baseline for Part B was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement 
(scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part B. For ECGs, baseline 
values were the average of the 3 pretreatment measurements on Day 1 of Part B. For sweat chloride, 
the baseline values were the mean of the last values on the left and the right arm prior to the first 
dose of the study. 
Missing Data and Outliers 
Incomplete/Missing data were not imputed, unless specified otherwise. 
Outliers: No formal statistical analyses were performed to detect or remedy the presence of statistical 
outliers, unless specified otherwise. 
Pharmacokinetic Data 
Samples were analysed using validated bioanalytical methods in compliance with Vertex or designee 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Calibration curves in human plasma for all 6 analytes ranged from 2.00 to 2000 ng/mL. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed upon the entire population given a dose of study drug(s), 
whether the subject completed all treatments or not, and if the dataset(s) supported those analyses as 
described in the Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP).  
PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods. PK parameters 
calculated in non-compartmental analyses included Cmax, tmax, Ctrough, t½, CLss/F, Vss/F, and AUCτ. The 
linear/log trapezoidal rule was used to estimate AUC with at least 4 quantifiable concentration-time 
points. The AUCτ calculation was based on the assumption that the drug concentration at the end of 
dosing interval (24 hours for TEZ and 12 hours for IVA) would be equal to the pre-dose concentration 
(0 hour) at steady state. PK parameters were summarized in terms of the total number of values (N), 
mean, and standard deviation (SD), minimum (min), median, maximum (max), coefficient of variation 
(CV%), geometric mean (geo mean), and CV% geo mean. For summary statistics of concentration-
time series, N, total values below the limits of quantification (NBLQ), mean, SD, min, median, max, 
and CV%, were presented.

Changes in Conduct of Study 
The Study 113 protocol was amended 2 times. Table 10 provides a list of the protocol versions, their 
dates, and the major changes introduced with every amendment. 
Table 6 Summary of Study VX15-661-113 Protocol Amendments
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses plan (SAP) version 1.0 is dated 31 October 2018. The SAP has not been 
amended during the trial. However, the SAP was only finalised during the conduct of the trial raising 
concerns on how the blinding of the dataset had been maintained. It has been clarified that the clinical 
database was outsourced and, as such, the MAH had no access to the database. There were no 
unplanned unblinding events and all patients were randomised before the end date of the finalisation 
of the SAP. In addition, the SAP was finalised before the database lock (01 Feb 2019). 
Baseline data 
Subject demographics for Part A are summarized in Table 11. The majority (92.3%) of subjects were 
white, and all subjects were not Hispanic or Latino. A total of 46.2% of subjects were male. The 
median age was 8 years (range: 6 to 11 years).

•  Part B 
The adult population PK model was applied to Study 113A data (N = 13) and showed reasonable 
predictions of the exposures observed in Study 113A. Simulations were conducted with the assumption 
that clearance and volume of distribution would scale allometrically with body weight using fixed 
exponents. Paediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age typically weigh between 15 and 50 kg, and 
population PK simulations were performed to compare exposures for subjects in this weight range to 
those observed in subjects ≥12 years old in Phase 3 TEZ/IVA studies. 
Across the weight range in 6- through 11-year-olds, simulated geometric mean ratios (Cmin, AUC, and 
Cmax) showed that subjects <25 kg receiving TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h would have higher 
exposures for parent TEZ compared to subjects ≥12 years old. The IVA weight cut-off was increased 
from 25 kg to 40 kg for Study 113B and Study 115 in order to (1) achieve exposures similar to 
subjects ≥12 years old across all of the weight ranges, (2) maintain the same TEZ:IVA dose ratio in 
the adult and paediatric populations, and (3) avoid exposures of TEZ that would be higher than those 
achieved in the ≥12-year-old population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 38/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, for Part B, the body weight cut-off for dosing was selected to be 40 kg, because modelling 
and simulations predicted the potential for higher TEZ exposures in subjects receiving 100 mg qd dose 
of TEZ. 
TEZ, M1-TEZ, and M2-TEZ  
Serial PK samples of TEZ and its metabolites were collected at Week 16 visit. Mean plasma 
concentration-time profiles of TEZ, M1-TEZ and M2-TEZ at Week 16 are presented in Figure 4.

Simulations of TEZ/IVA and M1-TEZ exposures with 35-kg, 30-kg and 25-kg cut-off for 
weight based dosing 
Weight cut-off-based dosing was used in Studies 113 and 115 with a weight cut-off of 40 kg. Upon 
review of the exposure data from these studies, an integrated popPK analysis of data was performed. 
The results from this integrated popPK analysis demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 11 years of 
age who weighed ≥40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, the distribution of individual 
TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures were similar to the observed range of subjects 12 years of age and 
older. For subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <40 kg and received TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 
75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower range of observed exposures 
of subjects 12 years and older. M1-TEZ exposures were similar to those of subjects 12 years and older 
(Table 23).  
Table 19 Summary of TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA observed steady-state exposures (AUCss) by 
age group, 40-kg weight cut-off 
Additional simulations were performed to optimise the final proposed dosing regimen. The objective of 
these popPK simulations was to determine whether a different weight cut-off would achieve TEZ parent 
and IVA parent PK exposures that are more similar to the exposures observed in subjects 12 years and 
older. For this purpose, weight cut-offs of 40 kg, 35 kg, 30 kg and 25 kg were applied. Approximately 
one third of subjects in Studies 113 and 115 weighed ≥30 kg and <40 kg. Results for AUC, Cmax and 
Cmin are shown in Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8.

older. Simulated AUCss for IVA, TEZ and M1-TEZ are summarised in Table 24.

PK/PD relation  
To evaluate the impact of increased TEZ exposures on efficacy, the sweat chloride PK/PD relationship 
in subjects 6 through 11 years of age was compared to that in subjects ≥12 years of age (Figure 9 ). 
This figure shows that the observed sweat chloride response in subjects 6 through 11 years of age 
overlaps with the response observed with subjects ≥12 years of age and was reasonably predicted by 
the relationship in subjects ≥12 years of age. In regions where the exposures overlap between these 2 
age groups, the PK/PD responses are similar with respect to shape, magnitude, and variability. The 
mean level sweat chloride response in subjects 6 through 11 years of ages was slightly better than the 
response observed in subjects ≥12 years of age, which is consistent with trends observed in the 
Kalydeco and Orkambi programs.  
To evaluate the impact of increasing TEZ exposures for the 30 to <40 kg subjects, these PK/PD figures 
were overlaid with boxplots of TEZ exposures in the 30 to <40 kg subgroup under the current posology 
(half of the adult dose; blue boxplot in Figure 9 B) versus the proposed posology (equivalent to the 
adult dose; red boxplot in Figure 9 B). This display confirms that increasing the TEZ exposure improves 
the sweat chloride response in 30 to <40 kg subjects, when evaluated in the context of the modelled 
relationship for subjects ≥12 years of age (black line). Based on the change in median exposure 
between these 2 doses, increasing the TEZ dose in this population of subjects reduces (i.e., improves) 
sweat chloride by 0.8 mmol/L, as quantified using the modelled relationship.  
Impact of Increased IVA Exposures  
A similar approach was taken to evaluate the impact of increased IVA exposures Figure 9  C and 9D). 
In this figure, the relationship between IVA exposure and sweat chloride is described by the locally 
estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) fit of the data points in subjects ≥12 years of age, because

the model did not account for the effect of continuous IVA concentration. Similar to TEZ, the PK/PD 
relationship in subjects 6 through 11 years of age was reasonably predicted by the relationship in 
subjects ≥12 years of age with respect to IVA. Increasing the IVA exposure is not expected to impact 
sweat chloride efficacy based on the relationship observed in subjects ≥12 years of age, as shown in 
Figure 9  D.

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
To support the extension of the indication for tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with IVA to patients 6 
through 11 years of age, studies 113 and 115 were conducted. 
Study 113 was a phase 3, 2-part, open-label study in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age, 
homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. Study 113 Part A (Study 113A) evaluated the PK, safety, 
and tolerability of TEZ/IVA administered for 14 days. Safety, tolerability, and available PK data from 
Part A were reviewed to determine the doses and the weight cut-offs to be evaluated in Study 113 Part 
B (Study 113B) and Study 115. Study 113B evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of TEZ/IVA 
administered for 24 weeks; assessments related to efficacy were also evaluated. Study 115 was a 
randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age, homozygous 
or heterozygous for F508del. Study 115 evaluated the efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA administered for 
approximately 8 weeks; assessment of TEZ/IVA pharmacokinetics was also evaluated.  
Children weighing ≥ 25 kg in Study 113A were dosed with the marketed formulation of IVA tablets, but 
not the marketed or to-be-marketed formulation of TEZ/IVA FDC tablets. All children in Study 113B 
were dosed with the marketed formulations of TEZ 100mg/IVA 150 mg and IVA 150 mg or with the to-
be-marketed formulations (i.e., FDC TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg and IVA 75 mg tablet) depending on body 
weight.  
Upon completion of Study 113A (N = 13), popPK simulations were performed using the allometric fixed 
exponents to compare exposures for subjects in the weight range from 15 to 50 kg to those observed 
in subjects ≥12 years old in the pivotal Phase 3 TEZ/IVA studies 106, 107, and 108. Across the weight 
range in 6- through 11-year-olds, simulated geometric mean ratios (Cmin, AUC, and Cmax) showed 
that subjects <25 kg receiving TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h would have higher exposures for 
parent TEZ compared to subjects ≥12 years old. The weight cut-off was thus increased from 25 kg to 
40 kg for Study 113B and Study 115 in order to achieve exposures similar to subjects ≥12 years old 
across all of the weight ranges, to maintain the same TEZ:IVA dose ratio in the adult and paediatric 
populations, and to avoid exposures of TEZ that would be higher than those achieved in the ≥12-year-
old population. 
Upon review of the exposure data from these studies, an integrated popPK analysis of data was 
performed. The results from this integrated popPK analysis demonstrated that for subjects 6 through 
11 years of age who weighed ≥40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h, the distribution 
of individual TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures were similar to the observed range of subjects 12 years 
of age and older. For subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <40 kg and received TEZ 50 mg 
qd/IVA 75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower range of observed 
exposures of subjects 12 years and older. M1-TEZ exposures were similar to those of subjects 12 years 
and older.  
Additional simulations were performed to optimise the final proposed dosing regimen. The objective of 
these popPK simulations was to determine whether a different weight cut-off would achieve TEZ parent 
and IVA parent PK exposures that were more similar to the exposures observed in subjects 12 years 
and older. For this purpose, weight cut-offs of 40 kg, 35 kg, 30 kg and 25 kg were applied. 
Approximately one third of subjects in Studies 113 and 115 weighed ≥30 kg and <40 kg. The body 
weight cut-off of 30 kg was proposed by the MAH on the basis that in the simulations presented the 
majority of TEZ and IVA PK exposures were predicted to fall within the adult reference range (5th to 
95th percentiles) and the median exposures will be more similar to the median adult exposure.   
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 47/120 
 
 
 
 
While it was acknowledged that the 30 kg cut-off resulted in the most comparable exposures for IVA, 
M1-TEZ and TEZ in children as compared to adolescents and adults as opposed to the other 
investigated weight cut-offs, for subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <30 kg and will 
receive TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures still fell within the lower 
range of observed exposures of subjects 12 years and older. On the other hand, more than 50% of 
paediatric patients were predicted to show M1-TEZ exposures higher than the upper limit of the 
established range in adults. As a consequence, the MAH was requested to perform further model-based 
PK and PK-PD simulations to show that the proposed posology based on a body weight cut-off of 30 kg 
did not negatively impact efficacy in children weighing less than 30 kg and resulted in better efficacy 
outcomes (than those observed in study 115) in children weighing ≥30 to less than 40 kg. Model based 
simulations for 1000 virtual subjects were performed to predict TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA exposures using 
the weight-based dosing cut-offs of 40 kg, 35 kg, and 30 kg. Based on these simulations, it was 
confirmed that only M1-TEZ AUC was affected by the body weight cut-off at 100 mg TEZ qd, showing 
significant differences in the proportion of patients within the exposure of adults: ~75% (40 kg cut-
off), ~50% (35 kg cut-off), and <50% (30 kg cut-off). No significant differences in M1-TEZ AUC were 
observed when 50 mg TEZ qd was considered, neither in TEZ and IVA AUC for both dose levels across 
the different body weight cut-offs.  
Furthermore, the MAH has explored through a PK/PD relationship the impact in terms of sweat chloride 
of selecting 30 kg vs 40 kg cut-off in paediatric patients with body weights between 30 and <40 kg as 
compared to that in patients aged 12 years and older. The plots of the PK/PD relationship do not show 
a significant change in terms of sweat chloride response when 30 or 40 kg cut-off was selected, which 
indicates that similar response rate will be achieved irrespective of the TEZ and IVA exposures 
compared to patients ≥12 years of age. A slight decrease (improvement) in sweat chloride (0.8 
mmol/l) is predicted in patients weighing 30 to <40 kg when receiving an increased dose compared to 
the actually received dose in study 115, due to the 30 kg cut-off. In children weighing less than 30 kg, 
the PK-PD data provided indicate that the sweat chloride reduction at the lower dose in children <30 
kg, despite the somewhat lower exposures to TEZ and IVA, is within the range of sweat chloride effects 
in patients ≥12 years of age, even though this could have been better addressed by comparing the 
predicted exposure-response in these children versus those weighing more than 30 kg.  
The ratio M1-TEZ/TEZ appears different for patients aged 6 through 11 years (with ratios of 2.1 and 
1.8 in patients <30 and ≥30 kg, respectively) and adolescents (ratio of 1.56) and adults (ratio 1.47). 
This seems to indicate that relatively more M1-TEZ is formed in children aged 6 through 11 years. The 
MAH was requested to discuss the involvement of TEZ and M1-TEZ in efficacy and safety and the 
relationship between the increased exposure of TEZ + M1-TEZ versus TEZ among the efficacy and 
safety endpoints. In conclusion, the actual cause for the increased formation of M1-TEZ remains 
unclear. In terms of sweat chloride, the increased exposure does not translate into greater response, 
since the maximum effect is practically reached in Q1 of exposure of TEZ and TEZ+M1-TEZ. In terms 
of safety, the additional data provided by the MAH such as the analysis of transaminase elevations by 
M1-TEZ levels in subjects ≥12 years of age and children 6 through 11 years of age is reassuring 
although based on a limited number of patients.  
No update was provided on pharmacodynamics. This is nevertheless acceptable as the mechanism of 
action of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is not age dependent. The reduction in sweat chloride observed in 
study 113B and study 115 is within the range of that observed in older patients. The PK/PD 
relationships provided show similar response within the range of predicted TEZ and IVA AUC exposures 
with the proposed dosing regimen based on a cut-off body weight of 30 kg. Overall, considering the 
above mentioned PK/PD relationship for sweat chloride and taking into account that similar M1-TEZ 
exposures have been observed in older patients with no indication of increased adverse event rates, 
the proposed body-weight cut-off of 30 kg is supported.

2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed posology for children aged 6 to less than 12 years which is based on a cut-off body 
weight of 30 kg is acceptable based on PopPK simulations and modelling as this dosing regimen was 
not investigated in studies 113B or 115 in children weighing ≥ 30 kg to less than 40 kg.

Not applicable. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
The main study to support the application is Study VX16-661-115 (study 115): A Phase III, Double-
blind, Parallel-group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tezacaftor in Combination With 
Ivacaftor in Patients Aged 6 Through 11 Years With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous or heterozygous for 
the F508Del-CFTR Mutation (see Figure 10) 
Methods 
Study design 
After the screening period of 4 weeks, patients were stratified by genotype before randomization so 
that F/F and F/RF patients would be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to either the TEZ/IVA group or the 
appropriate blinding group for their genotype. The F/F blinding group received placebo and the F/RF 
blinding group received IVA monotherapy. The placebo and IVA blinding groups’ treatment regimens 
were visually matched to the TEZ/IVA treatment regimen to maintain the blind.  
During the Screening Period, subjects who were treated with Orkambi or Kalydeco underwent a 28-day 
washout before the Day 1 Visit.

IVA: ivacaftor; q12h: every 12 hours; qd: once daily; TEZ: tezacaftor. 
After completing the Week 8 Visit, patients were offered the opportunity to enrol in a 96-week open-
label TEZ/IVA extension study (Study VX17-661-116). The Safety Follow-up Visit was not required for 
patients who enrolled in the extension study within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug in Study 
VX16-661-115. 
Patients who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment were asked to remain in the study and 
complete the efficacy assessments (LCI, CFQ-R, sweat chloride, spirometry, height, weight, BMI, and 
Drug Acceptability Questionnaire) from the time of discontinuation through the end of the Treatment 
Period. 
Study Participants 
Patients were 6 – 11 years old, males and females, with a confirmed diagnosis of CF. Patients were 
homozygous for F508Del-CFTR or heterozygous for F508Del and a second CFTR allele that results in 
residual CFTR function. Heterozygous patients must have a second eligible mutation that results in 
residual CFTR function (see table below). Genotyping was performed using a validated CF genotyping 
test and confirmed if the CF diagnosis was confirmed if the Sweat chloride was ≥ 60 mmol/L.

However, patients with a F/RF mutation could also be included if the sweat chloride was < 60 mmol, if 
these patients should have an additional chronic sino-pulmonary disease and/or 
gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities associated with CF.  
Enrolment was limited to patients with LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 at the Screening Visit, a body weight ≥ 15 kg 
and the ability to swallow the tablets. Spirometry at baseline (ppFEV1) could be normal (pp FEV1 
≥70%). Patients with a history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an 
additional safety risk (e.g., cirrhosis with portal hypertension, risk factors for Torsades de Pointes) 
were excluded from Study 115 Patients with protocol-defined laboratory values indicative of clinically 
significant abnormal liver or renal function were also excluded (either (a) any 2 or more of ≥ 3 x ULN 
for AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN; (b) ≥ 5 x ULN ALT or AST; (c) GFR ≤45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation, (d) hemoglobin <10 g/dL). These 
criteria were comparable to studies 103 and 104.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
A total of n=69 patients, who met the eligibility criteria were included. Patients were stratified by 
genotype before randomization so that F/F and F/RF patients would be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to 
either the TEZ/IVA group or the appropriate blinding group for their genotype. The F/F blinding group 
received placebo, and the F/RF blinding group received IVA monotherapy. The placebo and IVA 
blinding groups treatment regimens were visually matched to the TEZ/IVA treatment regimen to 
maintain the blind. 
Statistical methods 
Sample size  
The sample size of this study is driven by demonstrating that the treatment effect of TEZ/IVA is based 
on a within-group comparison (change from baseline in LCI2.5 in subjects on TEZ/IVA) to exclude a 
maximum possible placebo effect.  
The placebo effect was based on study VX14-809-109, Study 809-109 evaluated treatment with 
LUM/IVA in F508/F508 subjects aged 6 through 11 years using change from baseline in LCI as the 
primary efficacy endpoint. In Study 809-109, the placebo group had a mean worsening in LCI2.5 of 
0.08 units with an SD of 1.41 the one-sided 90% lower bound was -0.10 and is used as an estimate 
for the pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect for Study 115.  
Accounting for a 10% dropout rate, approximately 40 subjects on TEZ/IVA will provide at least 90% 
power to exclude -0.10. The study planned to enrol approximately 50 F/F subjects and up to 15 F/RF 
subjects. A placebo group of F/F subjects and an IVA mono group of F/RF subjects was included in this 
study. The main purpose was to preserve blinding, so that subjects and investigators do not assume a 
subject is receiving TEZ/IVA, which could introduce bias into the results. Descriptive statistics such as 
mean and SD are provided for change from baseline in LCI2.5 at each post-baseline visit for 
homozygous subjects in the placebo group.  
The target enrolment by genotype and treatment group is provided in the Table 12-1. 
Data sets 
The following analysis sets were defined:  
• All Subjects Set was defined as all patients who were randomised or dosed (i.e., all patients in3 the 
study). All patient data listings were referenced using the All Subjects Set, unless otherwise specified.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised patients who were exposed to at least 1 dose of study 
drug and had an eligible genotype. The treatment assignment for the FAS was as randomised.  
• Safety Set included all patients who were exposed to at least 1 dose of study drug. The treatment 
assignment for the Safety Set was as treated.

Efficacy analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (which included all patients randomized and 
dosed who had an eligible CFTR genotype) and performed as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP; Appendix 16.1.9). 
There was no adjustment for multiplicity; P values for secondary and additional endpoints are 
considered nominal.  
Efficacy analyses were based on within-group changes in the TEZ/IVA treatment group (F/F and F/RF 
genotypes combined). No hypothesis testing was performed for the placebo or IVA blinding groups. For 
the placebo group, only summary statistics were presented. For the IVA group, efficacy data were 
presented in listings only. 
Primary Endpoint- LCI2.5 
The primary endpoint was absolute within-group change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 8. For 
LCI2.5, a decrease in value reflects lung function improvement.  
The LCI2.5 was measured by the Exhalyzer D and centrally reviewed.  
The objective of the primary efficacy endpoint analysis was to demonstrate that the upper bound of the 
95% CI of the mean change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 8 in the TEZ/IVA group excluded a 
pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect. 
Based on the results of a previous study of LCI2.5 in placebo-treated paediatric (6- through 11-year-
old) patients with CF homozygous for F508Del (Study VX14-809-109), -0.10 was used as an estimate 
of the pre-defined maximum possible placebo effect on LCI2.5. 
The primary analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed-effect 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) for the patients in the TEZ/IVA treatment group. The model 
included absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 (including all measurements up to Week 8 [inclusive]) 
as the dependent variable, and visit (as a class variable) as a fixed effect, with adjustment for CFTR 
genotype (F/F and F/RF) and baseline LCI2.5 (continuous) value as covariates, and patient as a random 
effect. An unconstructed covariance structure was used to model the within-patient errors. 
The primary result obtained from the model was the estimated average treatment effect on LCI2.5 
through Week 8 for patients in the TEZ/IVA group. The corresponding within-group LS mean, SE, 95% 
CI, and P value were provided. If the upper bound of the 95% CI fell below the pre-defined maximum 
possible placebo effect (-0.10), the study would be considered to have achieved its primary objective. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Sweat Chloride 
A similar MMRM model was used to analyse sweat chloride data as described for the analysis of the 
primary efficacy variable, with the addition of baseline sweat chloride as a covariate. The assessment 
of efficacy was primarily based on the estimated within-group mean change from baseline at Week 8 in 
the TEZ/IVA group. 
CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score 
A similar MMRM model was used to analyse CFQ-R respiratory domain score, based on the Child 
Version of the questionnaire. Data were analysed using the same approach as described for the 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable, with the addition of baseline CFQ-R respiratory score as a 
covariate. The assessment of efficacy was primarily based on the estimated within-group mean change 
from baseline through Week 8.

Other endpoints 
ppFEV1 
A similar MMRM model was used for the FEV1 data as described for the analysis of the primary efficacy 
variable, with the addition of corresponding baseline values (continuous) as covariates as appropriate. 
Other endpoints were the LCI5.0, body mass index (BMI), BMI-for-age z-score, weight, weight-for-age 
z-score, height, height-for-age z-score, drug acceptability, faecal elastase-1 and immunoreactive 
trypsinogen, and pharmacokinetic parameters of TEZ, M1-TEZ, IVA, and M1-IVA.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of N= 92 patients were screened.  
Screen failures 
A total of 23 patients were screened but not enrolled. The main reasons for screening failure was a 
LCI2.5 < 7.5 (n=11), having percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) <70 % 
at screening (n=6), having a recent acute illness (n=2), other reasons (n=2), having laboratory 
abnormalities deemed exclusionary (n=1), and not being able to swallow tablets (n=1 ) 
Randomised patients  
A total of 69 patients were randomized and 67 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug (54 
patients in the TEZ/IVA group; 10 patients in the placebo group; 3 patients in the IVA group).  
Of the 67 patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 66 (98.5%) completed study drug 
treatment. One patient prematurely discontinued treatment, because the patient’s screening LCI2.5 did 
not meet the eligibility criteria.

-  Protocol and amendments  
•  Study protocol 
The final Study protocol is dated 17 November 2017. The clinical study protocol included one country-
specific amendment to specify the volume of blood to be drawn at each study visit (Poland). 
During the trial, the Safety and tolerability data was reviewed by an independent data monitoring 
committee (IDMC). 
• 
Important protocol deviations 
There were 2 Important Protocol Deviations in the study, both related to inclusion/exclusion criteria i.e. 
one patient had a LCI2.5 <7.5 (n=1) and discontinued the study. Another patient had a change in 
antibiotic therapy for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1.

Notes 
in patients weighing 30-40 kg, the current applied posology resulted in the low range of 
exposure compared to adult data. The applicant applies for a higher posology in this 
population. This posology has not been investigated in the current population. Knowledge is 
lacking it the higher exposure will result in improved efficacy  
Analysis description 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a mixed-effects 
model for repeated measures with LCI2.5 at each time point as the outcome variable. The 
estimated mean change from baseline through Week 8 in LCI2.5 for subjects treated with 
TEZ/IVA along with the corresponding 95% CI will be provided. If the upper bound of the 
95% CI is below the pre-defined maximum placebo effect (-0.10 U), it will be interpreted as 
sufficient evidence to achieve the primary efficacy objective.  
Additional sensitivity analyses using the placebo mean imputation input are provided in 
Table 37.

Supportive study  
Study 113B 
Study VX15-661-113, a Phase 3, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, 
and Tolerability of VX-661 in Combination with Ivacaftor in Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of 
Age With Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous or Heterozygous for the F508Del-CFTR Mutation. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study 113 B is to assess the safety and tolerability of TEZ/IVA combination 
therapy. Secondary objectives include PK of TEZ/IVA and metabolites (M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, M1–IVA and 
M6-IVA) and the efficacy of TEZ/IVA combination therapy. 
Study design 
Study 113 Part B included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (24 weeks [± 5 days]), and 
Safety Follow-up Visit (4 weeks [± 7 days]). 
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data was completed by an internal Vertex team after completion 
of Part A to select the TEZ/IVA dose regimens for Part B. 
The following doses were provided during part B:  
• 
• 
Patients < 40 kg: TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients ≥ 40 kg: TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h 
At the Week 24 Visit, subjects who completed study drug treatment were offered the opportunity to 
enrol in an extension study evaluating TEZ/IVA (enrolment was based on the eligibility criteria 
specified within the extension study). A Safety Follow-up Visit was scheduled to occur 4 weeks (± 7 
days) after the last dose of study drug. The Safety Follow-up Visit was not required for subjects who 
enrolled in the extension study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects who 
permanently discontinued study drug treatment before the Week 24 Visit had an Early Treatment 
Termination (ETT) Visit and a Safety Follow-up Visit.

Study 113B included a total of n=70 patients, most patients n=68 (97.1%) were white and male n=36 
(51.4%). The mean (SD) age was 8.1 (1.8) years, the mean (SD) weight was 30.7 (10.0) Kg, and 
mean (SD) height 131.0 (13.0) cm (Table 15, Table 16) 
Assessment report

The study population consisted of N=61 F505/F508 and n=9 F/RF patients, all second RF mutations 
were approved for Symkevi. At baseline, the mean (SD) FEV1 was 1.56 (0.46) L, corresponding with a 
mean (SD) ppFEV1 of 91.1 (12.3) %. At baseline, the mean (SD) sweat chloride was 99.1 (19.2) 
mmol.L-1. (Table 16)  
The study was conducted in the USA and Canada. The number of patients weighing ≥30 kg to <40 kg 
at baseline was 21 (30%); the number of patients weighing ≥40 kg at baseline was 8/70 (11.4%). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Assessments (secondary outcome measure)  
Part B:  
The efficacy assessment for part B were Spirometry, weight and weight z-score, height and height z-
score, BMI and BMI z-score, sweat chloride, and CFQ-R. Optional exploratory sub study conducted at a 
subset of sites: The Lung clearance index was measured by the EasyOne Pro LAB (NDD, Zurich 
Switzerland). These efficacy outcomes were measured as secondary outcome measures. 
Safety Assessments 
The safety assessment included: Adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, 
haematology, coagulation studies, lipids, vitamins, and urinalysis), standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, 
pulse oximetry, physical examinations (PEs), spirometry and Ophthalmologic examinations.  
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrolment was approximately 56 subjects. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately 
50 subjects were expected to complete Part B. The incidence of AEs is an important safety endpoint. 
With a total sample size of 50 subjects completing the study, there would be a 92.3% chance of 
observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate were 5%, and a 99.5% chance of 
observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate were 10%. These probabilities were 
calculated by assuming a binomial distribution for the number of AEs using SAS. 
Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets were defined: Safety Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and FAS – LCI Substudy. 
- 
- 
The Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B 
of the study. 
The FAS was defined as all subjects who carried the intended CFTR mutations and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug in Part B of the study. The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses 
except for LCI endpoints. 
- 
The FAS - LCI sub study was defined as all subjects who carried the intended CFTR mutations 
and received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B of the study and had at least 1 LCI 
measurement. The FAS-LCI sub study was used for efficacy analyses of exploratory LCI 
endpoints. 
Variables 
Definition of Treatment-emergent Period 
The treatment-emergent period for Part B corresponds to data from the first dose of study drug to 28 
days after the last dose of the study drug, or to the date of completion of study participation, 
whichever occurred first.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 75/120 
 
 
 
 
Definition of Baseline 
The baseline for was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) 
collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part B. For ECGs, baseline values were the average of 
the 3 pre-treatment measurements on Day 1 of Part B. For sweat chloride, the baseline values were 
the mean of the last values on the left and the right arm prior to the first dose of the study. 
Missing Data and Outliers 
Incomplete/Missing data were not imputed, unless specified otherwise. 
Outliers: No formal statistical analyses were performed to detect or remedy the presence of statistical 
outliers, unless specified otherwise. 
Efficacy Analysis) 
All efficacy analyses described in this section were based on the FAS, unless specified otherwise. The 
analysis included all available measurements through the last assessment, including measurements 
after treatment discontinuation. 
There was no multiplicity adjustment, the p values provided for the secondary and other endpoints are 
considered nominal. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Through Week 24 
This endpoint is defined as the average of the absolute changes from baseline in ppFEV1 at each post-
baseline scheduled visit. 
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-
based mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach that included visit and baseline 
ppFEV1 (continuous) as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. An unstructured (co)variance 
structure was used to model the within-subject errors. If the model failed to converge, a compound 
symmetry covariance structure was considered. The degrees of freedom of the denominator was 
approximated by the Kenward-Roger’s method. 
The primary result obtained from the model was the average treatment effect through Week 24. The 
corresponding least squares mean (LS mean), standard error (SE), the 95% CI, and P value were 
provided. 
Other outcome measures  
A similar MMRM model as described for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 
used for relative change from baseline in percentage predicted FEV1 and Absolute Change from 
Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score. For the outcome measures Absolute Change from 
Baseline in Weight, Height, BMI, and Associated z-Scores the similar MMRM model was used for 
measuring the change from baseline At Week 24.  
The same slightly adjusted model was also applied for the Absolute Change from Baseline in Sweat 
Chloride Through Week 4 and Through Week 24. Because the first post-baseline assessment of sweat 
chloride was performed at week 4, the estimated change at week 4 was used to assess the absolute 
change in sweat chloride through week 4.  
Safety Data 
Safety was the primary objective of Part B. Safety analyses were based on the Safety Set in each 
study part. Only descriptive analysis of safety was performed (i.e., no statistical hypothesis testing was 
performed).

Statistical Analysis Plan 
The following changes were made in the SAP for Part B compared to the protocol: 
• The All Subjects Set for Part B was removed in the SAP, due to the fact that the All Subjects Set for 
Part B would be the same for the Safety Set Part B, which included all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug in Part B. Subject data listings were presented based on the Safety Set Part B. 
• The details of mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) approach was updated in the SAP 
considering the study design and study population.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical programme for children aged 6 through 11 years is based on the partial extrapolation of 
efficacy from adults to children, supported by PK/safety study VX15-661-113 and pivotal phase 3 
parallel-group trial VX16-661-115 in 67 patients aged 6-11 years. 
The key studies to support the efficacy and safety in adults and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years were 
studies VX14-661-106 and study VX14-661-108 and VX14-661-110 (safety only). Study 106 and 108 
were both randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials. Study 106 was a parallel 
designed study conducted in patients homozygous for F508/F508 of 24-week duration; study 108 was 
a crossover study conducted in patients heterozygous for F508 –and a residual function and had a 
duration of 8 weeks. Study 110 provided long-term safety data. These studies led to the approval of 
TEZ/IVA (Symkevi) in February 2018 for patients with CF ≥12 years old who have an indicated CFTR 
genotype (homozygote F508/F508 and certain heterogeneous patients F508 with a residual function).  
The clinical development in patients 6 through 11 years of age was initiated in 2016. The initial aim of 
Study VX15-661-113 was to obtain similar TEZ and IVA pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures to adults and 
to demonstrate safety in this age group. The efficacy was included as a secondary outcome parameter. 
The study VX16-661-115 was designed to provide a bridge on the efficacy and safety results from 
patients aged 6-11 years to patients aged ≥ 12 years.

Subjects from both 113 and 115 were offered the opportunity to enrol in an open-label extension 
(Study VX17-661-116 [Study 116]). Study 116 is ongoing and will support long-term safety and 
persistence of efficacy.

Rationale for an extrapolation from adult to paediatric patients of Symkevi in patient 
homozygote for F508/F508 and certain types of F508/RF mutations.  
The MAH did not consider that a Randomised Controlled Trial in children is necessary. The MAH 
considers that the extrapolation is appropriate, because of the similarities in the genetic, molecular and 
pathophysiological aetiology of CF between adults and children during the disease. The MAH also

considers that the extrapolation approach is consistent with the principles described in ICH E11 and the 
EMA reflection paper on paediatric extrapolation. 
The MAH did not completely follow the Scientific advice adopted by CHMP on their development: 
-  The CHMP preferred the use of a placebo-controlled trial to show the efficacy. The primary 
endpoint should be a clinically relevant difference between test and placebo. However, absolute 
change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 8 for TEZ/IVA has been included as the primary 
endpoint, i.e. not compared to the placebo or IVA control arm. 
-  The primary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline through week 8 for the LCI2.5. The 
CHMP preferred to use the absolute change from baseline to week 8, as the former endpoint 
may obscure the loss of efficacy over time.  
Additionally, although no explicitly recommended, the long-term extension supportive study 113B did 
not include the same efficacy parameter LCI2.5 as the pivotal trial 115. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This extension of indication for children aged 6-11 years is primarily based on the concept of partial 
extrapolation.  
In this partial extrapolation strategy, only limited paediatric data were provided because the safety and 
efficacy has been shown in the adult studies. This strategy of partial extrapolation was agreed by the 
CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/2814/3/2017/PED/II), provided that the results of the paediatric studies would be 
compelling and robustly confirm the absence of a placebo effect.  
Indeed, the strategy of partial extrapolation can be justified in CF for the CFTR therapies, because of 
the similar underlying genetic, and molecular aetiology of CF between children and patients ≥ 12 
years. The biochemical defect of the defective chloride channels is present from birth and because of 
the longstanding defects, it results in sequelae in the lung, pancreas and other organs emerging 
progressively throughout childhood and into adulthood. These sequelae may negatively affect the 
course of the disease over time, e.g. like the more frequent exacerbations is adulthood compared to 
childhood.  
The CFTR therapies improve the Cl transport, and as such, they can be regarded as a targeted therapy 
for the disease for which the extrapolation strategy is justified.  
However, this partial extrapolation approach to establish the treatment in paediatric population differs 
from previous CFTR-applications like ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi) that 
established the role of these therapies in children aged 6-11 years. These products were approved on 
the basis of a benefit established in a comparative placebo-controlled phase III randomised controlled 
trial as it was unclear at that time whether the clinical course of the disease would be different 
between adults and children. These studies showed efficacy results in the paediatric population that 
were in line with the adult population, supporting the concept of partial extrapolation. After the efficacy 
had been established in children aged 6-11-year, various extension of indication applications have 
since been approved for the younger children based on the concept of extrapolation.  
The key steps for the partial extrapolation are 
1.  Show that the treatment is effective and safe in the adult population 
2.  Confirm that the adult PK is predictive for the paediatric PK 
3.  To show that the product has a predictive pharmacodynamic effect 
4.  Provide evidence for efficacy, so that the results of adults can be extrapolated to children 
5.  Evaluate the safety profile 
Step 1: Demonstrate that the treatment is effective and safe in the adult population.

Symkevi has an established efficacy in the treatment of CF in adults and in children aged 12 years and 
older by showing improvement in lung function using FEV1, sweat chloride and Quality of life compared 
to placebo. This has led to the EU approval of Symkevi for CF patients homozygous for F508/F08 and 
heterozygous for specific F/RF mutations (studies 101, 103, 106 and 108, EMEA/H/C/004682/0000) in 
2019.  
Limited data has been submitted to support current application in children. The paediatric data set 
consists of 3 studies: study 113 A to support the PK, 113B to support the PK and long-term safety, and 
the pivotal study 115 to support the efficacy. Upon request by CHMP, the interim analysis of the long-
term safety study 116 was also provided.  
Step 2: Demonstrate that the adult PK is predictive for the paediatric PK.  
In the concept of the partial extrapolation strategy, the dose selection is essential to provide similar 
exposures in the paediatric population compared to the adult population. Throughout the clinical 
program, PK was collected both in adults and children (Study 113 and 115). After the review of the 
totality of data (including study 115), it appeared that the exposure with tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 
75 mg in patients weighing between 30-40 kg is below the exposure observed in adults. Therefore, the 
applicant proposed to lower the weight-based posology from 40 kg to 30 kg to better align with the 
adult exposures. This dose adjustment is considered acceptable (see PK section).  
As a result of this modified posology, no clinical safety and efficacy has been provided for these 
patients. This adjusted posology affects about 40% of the propose EU target population and the safety 
and efficacy for this population must be extrapolated from the current and adult database as well. 
Step 3: Demonstrate that the product has a predictive pharmacodynamic effect  
The pharmacodynamic effect of Symkevi, sweat chloride transport was included as a secondary 
efficacy measure of efficacy in study 115. The sweat chloride transport is an important parameter in 
this clinical program supporting demonstration of pharmacodynamic effect. If this outcome measure 
shows the same improvement in paediatrics as in adults, then it will provide support for the 
extrapolation of the safety and efficacy from adults and children aged 12 years and older to younger 
children from 6 to 11 years.  
Step 4: Provide evidence for efficacy, so that the results of adults can be extrapolated to children 
The pivotal efficacy study is study 115. This study will be supported with longer term  24 weeks 
efficacy data obtained in study 113; a study primarily aimed to investigate the PK.  
Both studies 113 and 115 were performed with a weight dose posology of 40 kg but not with the 
applied weight-based posology of 30 kg. Therefore, both studies 113 and 115 will not provide evidence 
for the overall proposed target population, but the results might be used for extrapolation for the 
proposed posology.  
The pivotal study 115 included a heterogeneous CF patient population characterised by F/F and F/RF 
mutations. The treatments included TEZ/IVA, placebo and IVA (ivacaftor). The patients were 
randomised in a 4:1 randomisation to active vs the appropriate blinding group i.e. placebo 
(F508/F508) or ivacaftor (F508/RF). The primary efficacy endpoint was within treatment difference 
from baseline through week 8 for the LCI2.5 in the patient treated with TEZ/IVA. 
The following additional comments are made regarding the study design of study 115 referring the 
design, statistics and conduct of the study.

Design  
General comment 
The pivotal paediatric study 115 was designed to show a statistically significant difference between 
baseline and week 8 of treatment for the TEZ/IVA treated patients. Therefore, the study will provide 
more evidence of efficacy then would be necessary according to the concept of partial extrapolation, 
where only supportive data may be necessary. Therefore, this study can also be seen as a stand-alone 
study to support the paediatric application, although in that case a randomised trial would have been 
preferred.  
•  Study 115 is effectively designed as a single trial arm  
Study 115 included 3 treatments, TEZ/IVA, placebo and IVA (ivacaftor). The patients were randomised 
4:1 to either active or the appropriate, blinding group, i.e. placebo (F508/F508) or ivacaftor (F508/RF).  
Although the study is described as a parallel study, the study can effectively be considered an adjusted 
single-arm trial for several reasons:  
The overall effect size is driven by the TEZ/IVA group as this includes 80% of the population 
• 
•  No between treatment comparisons are performed 
• 
Each treatment included another patient population, hampering a between treatment 
comparison. The TEZ/IVA group included both F508/F508 and F508/RF, while the placebo 
group would only include a F508/F508 patient population and the IVA group a F508/RF patient 
population.  
• 
The number of included patient group in the placebo group (n=10) or ivacaftor group (n=3) is 
too small to allow for comparisons 
Therefore, by design, the study will provide insufficient comparative data with placebo. The results of 
this study need to be considered in light of the results obtained in adult data.  
Furthermore, from a formal point of view, the CHMP considered that the placebo-treated homozygous  
F508/F508 patients could have been considered as being undertreated as Orkambi received a positive 
opinion for the extension of the indication for F506/F508 patients for children aged ≥ 6 years on 09 
November 2017. The trial started in May 2018. Thus, the patients randomised to placebo should have 
been treated with Orkambi. 
• 
Treatment duration is relatively short  
The study has a short duration, i.e. 8 weeks, which is justified by the extrapolation strategy as 
previous studies have shown that the effect of CFTR modulator therapy is present at week 2 of 
treatment and maintained throughout the 24-week. Moreover, additional supportive long-term 
treatment data is collected in study 113.   
• 
The primary endpoint is the within treatment difference for the LCI2.5  
The primary endpoint was the within treatment difference for the LCI2.5 measurement. Although a 
placebo-controlled trial was preferred, this -within treatment outcome- would need a lower number of 
patients compared with showing a statistically significant effect from placebo outcome.  
The pivotal paediatric study 115 used a different lung function measurement as primary endpoint than 
commonly used in the adult studies i.e. the LCI2.5 instead of the ppFEV1. The LCI2.5 can measure 
changes in the small airways, while the ppFEV1 is more associated with large airways. In CF, the small 
airways are earlier affected than the large airways. Therefore, the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement 
of efficacy is acceptable, given the well-preserved lung function in children.  
Although, the experience with the LCI2.5 in clinical studies is limited, it  has been accepted as a primary 
outcome measure for example to support the paediatric application of Orkambi, based on a large, 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 86/120 
 
 
 
 
placebo-controlled, double-blind study (Study VX14-889-109, EMEA/H/00395/X/020). 
The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 is not known.  Therefore, an effect 
larger than the natural variability might be regarded as clinically relevant. The natural variability for 
the LCI2.5 is 1 unit2 or 15 % of baseline3. 
Previous applications in adults and children, however, have been approved based on lung function 
improvements (FEV1 2-3%: Bronchitol EMEA/H/C/001252; FEV1 2-3% Orkambi EMEA H/C/003954, 
Symkevi (3-4%) that were smaller than the natural variability of FEV1 observed in adults i.e. 4.9% 
(Stanfood4). These products were approved considering that an improvement in lung function in CF 
could be regarded as clinically relevant due to the detrimental course of disease.  
• 
Estimated effect size  
The primary endpoint of the study was the within treatment difference from placebo through week 8. 
The lower limit of efficacy was estimated to be -0.10 U as this would be considered the maximum 
placebo effect. This effect was based on the placebo results of study 809-109, a study conducted in F/F 
patients aged 6-11 years. This estimated outcome with placebo is rather optimistic because it suggests 
that the lung function would improve upon placebo, while the lung function deteriorates over time. 
Therefore, the estimated placebo effect for the lower limit of efficacy appears to be a conservative 
estimate.  
•  Change from baseline LCI2.5 through week 8 instead of at week 8 
The primary efficacy variable was the change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 8. The CHMP 
prefers the use of absolute change from baseline at week 8, because this endpoint is less likely to 
mask deteriorations over time compared to endpoint through week 8. Both endpoints were provided 
for the overall study population. 
•  Secondary and other endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included analyses of sweat chloride and the Cystic Fibrosis 
Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] for the within treatment difference in the TEZ/IVA treatment group. 
These outcome measures were comparable to the one that were used in the adults’ program.  
•  Other collected endpoints  
Other outcome measures were amongst others the absolute change in the percent predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) and the drug acceptability assessment. 
Study population  
Study 115 enrolled a total of 69 patients of 6 – 11 years old, with a confirmed diagnosis of CF, defined 
as 2 CF-causing mutations in addition to either chronic sino-pulmonary disease and/or 
gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities. The inclusion criteria were generally acceptable, reflective of 
the proposed target population and in line with the Symkevi pivotal trials submitted for the initial 
authorisation.  
Despite the broader inclusion criteria, the trial included only patients with a Symkevi approved RF 
mutation. Therefore, the results of the adult population might be extrapolated to the paediatric 
population.

The enrolment was limited to subjects with LCI 2.5 ≥7.5 at the Screening Visit, reflective of uneven 
ventilation and small airways disease. Patients could have a normal spirometry at baseline, which is 
representative for the proposed target population.  
Patients with a history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an 
additional safety risk were excluded, which is agreed considering the experimental nature of the study. 
Statistical considerations 
Included number of patients 
The study included more patients than was needed to show a statistically significant difference for the 
primary endpoint. The inclusion of more patients was justified to maintain the blind and to extend the 
indication to patients with a F/RF mutation.  
Statistical analyses 
The primary and secondary outcome measures were conducted according MMRM analyses that assume 
that patients who do not provide data at week 8 (n=5 for LCI2.5, n = 6 for sweat chloride), continue to 
benefit from treatment. As a result, the treatment effect might be overestimated. At the request of the 
CHMP, an additional sensitivity analysis using a more conservative approach, i.e. using MMRM analyses 
with placebo mean imputation was submitted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline and disease characteristics 
The pivotal study 115 did include 67 CF patients aged 6-11 years homozygote for F508/F508 (n=52) 
and F508/RF (n=15). The mean (SD) age of the included patient population was 8.6 years. Slightly 
more females (55.2%) were included. The mean (SD) -0.26 (0.78) BMI z-score was below the normal 
value . Patients had evidence of uneven ventilation due to small airways disease at screening mean 
(SD) LCI2.5 9.54 U (1.97) but had a normal spirometry mean (SD) ppFEV1 87.1% (12.2).  
A total of 54 patients were randomised to TEZ/IVA (42 F508/F508 and 12 F508/RF), and 10 patients to 
placebo (F508/F508) and 3 patients (F508/RF) to ivacaftor. 
Although the included numbers are small, the patient demographics appeared to be balanced for age, 
weight, height, LCI2.5 and ppFEV1. The overall disease and baseline characteristics appear to be 
representative for the proposed target population.  
•  Weight distribution  
The proposed posology is weight based and has currently a different cut-off compared to the study. As 
the consequence, the newly proposed posology will affect the patient with a body weight ≥30 kg and 
<40 kg. A total of 28 (42%) of the included patients have a body weight ≥30 kg and <40 kg and were 
underdosed according to the currently proposed posology. As such, the included population will provide 
limited direct evidence for the proposed posology and results need to be extrapolated.  
Results:  
Primary efficacy analyses: LCI 2.5  
Overall TEZ/IVA population treated population 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in LCI 2.5 from baseline through 
week 8 for TEZ/IVA. Note that an improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is 
shown by a numerical decrease from baseline.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 88/120 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was met in demonstrating a statistically significant within treatment difference of 
LCI2.5 of -0.51 U (95% CI: -0.74 to -0.29; P <0.0001). The upper bound of the 95% CI (-0.29) was 
below the pre-specified maximum placebo effect of -0.10.  
Additional sensitivity analyses using the placebo mean imputation showed comparable effects for the 
overall population. 
F508/F508 and F508/RF – TEZ/IVA treated patients  
Both the included subgroup of patients with F508/F508 and F508/RF showed both improvements from 
baseline. The effect was larger in the subgroup F508/RF compared with the homozygote group: 
summary statistics LS mean SD -0.92 U (1.08) vs -0.39 U (0.91).  
The additional sensitivity analyses using mean placebo mean imputation showed that in both 
subgroups, the point estimate exceeded the predefined -0.10 Units. The observed efficacy was larger 
for the F/RF (-1.07 U; 95% CI -1.49, -0.64) group compared to F/F (-0.32 U; 95%CI -0.56, -0.07). For 
the F/F group, the lower bound of the 95% CI crossed the predefined boundary of -0.07 at the 
endpoint through week 8, but not at week 8, thus exceeding the pre-specified maximum placebo effect 
of -0.10. 
Though, the results might be regarded as relevant. The predefined margin for placebo was a 
conservative estimate and the observed improvements in lung function were supported with a relevant 
improvement in the sweat chloride, an effect that was comparable as observed in adults. In adults, the 
observed improvement in sweat chloride resulted in a clinically relevant improvement in lung function 
supporting the clinical benefit in the paediatric population.  
Supportive study 113 
The supportive study 113 shows a small initial deterioration in LCI2.5, but at the end of treatment, the 
LCI2.5 is almost returned to the baseline value. CF is a progressive disease, and a deterioration 
compared with baseline would have been expected. As no deterioration is seen compared to baseline, 
these results suggest that the improvement is maintained over time. However, no strong conclusion 
can be made by the lack of placebo comparison and the small number of included patients. 
Secondary outcome measures 
Sweat chloride 
The primary efficacy outcome in study 115 was supported with statistically significant within treatment 
improvements in sweat chloride and ppFEV1 for patients treated with TEZ/IVA. 
The observed within treatment improvement in the pharmacodynamic parameter sweat chloride was 
comparable to the one observed in the adult population i.e. LS mean (SD) -12.3 (1.5) mmol/L and -9.9 
(0.5) mmol/L in children and adults, respectively. The study showed within treatment improvements in 
the sweat chloride transport for both subgroups F508/F508 and F508/RF in line with the results 
observed in adults.  
This observed effect in the sweat chloride shows that TEZ/IVA modulated the CFTR function in the 
paediatric population to the same extent as in adults. It provides the bridge to the adult data to 
extrapolate the efficacy and safety obtained in adults to paediatrics and supports the effect of the 
partial extrapolation.  
The reduction in sweat chloride is consistent with at least partial restoration of the CFTR dysfunction 
and with the combined corrector/potentiator action of TEZ/IVA. As expected, no improvement in sweat 
chloride was observed in the placebo group (mean (SD) change at week 8: -1.0 (12.3) mmol/L.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 89/120 
 
 
 
Other outcome measures  
ppFEV1 and CFQ-R  
The ppFEV1 showed a small, but statistically improvement with baseline through week 8, supporting 
the improvements in the LCI 2.5. The observed improvement in the ppFEV1 in this paediatric 
population has a smaller effect size is smaller (LS mean (SE): 2.8 (0.9%), p=0.0024), than observed 
in the adult population (LS mean (SE): 3.4 (0.3) %). This smaller effect size is not an unexpected 
finding, as in children the lung function is often preserved, leaving less room for improvement. Though, 
the observed improvement exceeds the annual rate of decline in both F/RF subjects (-0.80 percentage 
points) and F/F subjects (-1.32 percentage points) 6 to 12 years of age, supporting the efficacy of 
TEZ/IVA in this population.  
Study 113 showed a small mean (SD) improvement from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24, which 
may support the finding that the treatment effects in lung function are maintained over time.  
The CFQ-R showed a numerical improvement from baseline. Unlike adults, no statistically significant 
difference was observed.  
Growth outcome parameters  
During treatment Weight, z-score, Height z-score and BMI z-score remained stable, without 
improvement. An extra-pulmonary effect in weight, the height of BMI is therefore not established.  
Cross study comparison with LUM/IVA 
Symkevi is proposed for the homozygous F/F population. This population overlaps with the target 
population of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Therefore, a cross-study comparison was made with the pivotal 
study VX14-809-109, the study leading to the approval of lumacaftor/ivacator. 
Although conclusions from cross-study comparisons have undoubted limitations, the comparisons show 
that the observed improvement in LCI2.5 compared to placebo is smaller with Symkevi (LS mean 
difference -0.71 U; 95% CI -1.28, -0.13) than with Orkambi (-1.07 U; 95% CI -1.42, -0.71). Also, a 
smaller difference in the sweat chloride is observed with Symkevi (LS mean difference -10.7 mmol/L; 
95%CI -18.5, -2.9) vs Orkambi (-25.6 mmol/L; 95% CI -28.6, -22.5). These cross-study comparisons 
suggest that Orkambi might be of more value in the treatment of paediatric CF homozygous patients 
than Symkevi. However, head to head comparisons are missing to allow firm conclusions.  
Symkevi fulfils an unmet medical need for F/F patients who cannot tolerate Orkambi due to respiratory 
adverse events or who cannot take it due to drug-drug interactions. However, once the extension of 
the indication is approved, the use will likely not be limited to these patients. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that the results of the F/F subgroup should be mentioned in the SmPC in order to provide 
careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk ratio on an individual basis in comparison with 
Orkambi SmPC. 
2.5.4.    Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The current application is based on partial extrapolation. The pivotal study 115 was a parallel designed 
study but effectively a single-arm trial investigating the within treatment improvement of TEZ/IVA in 
CF patients harbouring an F/F mutation or a certain F/RF mutation. The study met its primary endpoint 
by showing a clinically relevant improvement in the LCI2.5 from baseline through week 8. Also, a 
relevant improvement in ppFEV1 was shown. These improvements were supported with an increase in 
sweat chloride transport, an improvement in line with adult data. The paediatric data show that 
TEZ/IVA modulates the CFTR function, which leads to improvements in lung function. The observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 90/120 
 
 
 
 
lung functions improvements in paediatrics are supported with data obtained in the adult population. 
Thus, the trial provided the evidence to support the partial extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to 
the paediatric population.  
The study was conducted with a lower posology in patients weighing 30-40 kg than the currently 
proposed posology. The proposed adapted higher posology will affect about 40% of the EU population. 
Additional PD/PK modelling showed that new posology increases sweat chloride transport, further 
supporting the efficacy for the proposed posology.  
However, cross-study comparisons raised the concern that the reported efficacy measured by the LCI 
and sweat chloride might be somewhat lower than observed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Therefore, the 
results of the subgroups should be reported in the SmPC, to provide a careful consideration of the 
benefit-risk ratio on an individual basis in comparison with Orkambi.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The patients that entered study 113B and 115 are the main datasets to support the safety of the 
applied application. Additional long-term safety was provided by the interim analyses for safety 
(data cut-off date 18 December 2019) of VX17-661-116 when all patients had completed the week 48 
visit of part A of the study.  
Study 116 is a phase 3, open-label, rollover study to evaluate the safety of long-term treatment with 
Tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older homozygous or 
heterozygous for the F508DelCFTR mutation. The study enrolled patients who completed the study 
VX15-661-113B and VX16-661-115. Patients who permanently stopped treatment because of elevated 
transaminases were not allowed to participate. Those who temporarily stopped treatment due to 
elevated transaminase could participate after 4-week negative rechallenge.  
The study included a total of 130 patients, while up to 133 patients could be included. 
The study consisted of two parts, part A and part B. In part A, the patients received treatment for up 
to 96 weeks according to the same posology as applied in the clinical studies.  
After completing part, A, patients could be entered in part B. Part B was added following an 
amendment (data 8 Nov 2019) to collect additional long-term safety data according to the new 
proposed posology using the 30 Kg weight cut off.  
The interim safety analyses of study 116 was conducted before the implementation of the amendment. 
Therefore, the currently provided safety data will not provide clinical safety data according to the 
currently applied posology.  
Safety data set  
The main data safety database set for TEZ/IVA treated children age 6-11yrs is defined by the parent 
studies, i.e. study 113B (n=70) and study 115 (n=54) and consists of 124 patients. Additional long-
term safety data is provided n=130 patient that rolled over to the long-term safety study 116. The 
additional cumulative exposure set combined the exposure of TEZ/IVA received in the parent studies 
113B or 115 and study 116 (n=129 subjects with >48 weeks cumulative TEZ/IVA exposure). 
The comparison with placebo is limited to the 10 F/F patients that were treated for 8 weeks during the 
study 115.

Patient exposure 
Table 45 summarizes the exposure to TEZ/IVA in the parent studies (i.e. study 113B and 115), Study 
116 and cumulatively TEZ/IVA exposure across the parent studies and Study 116.  
The median exposure in the parent studies was 23.3 weeks (n=125), 68.1 weeks in study 116 
(n=130) and 75.9 weeks in the cumulative exposure safety set (n=137). 
In the cumulative analyses a total of 129 patients had an exposure > 48 weeks, and 37 had an 
exposure > 96 weeks (Table 45).

Adverse events 
On overview of the adverse events of the main safety data sets is provided in Table 46. For 
comparison, also the placebo arm of study 115 is included. 
The overall incidence of AE or treatment related AE’s was generally comparable. However, the 
incidence of SAE’S was higher in study 116 (n=27; 20.8%) and the cumulative exposure (n=31; 
22.6%) compared to the parent studies 115 and 113b (n=6; 4.8%) (Table 46).

No deaths were reported in any of the studies. 
Laboratory findings 
During the study, liver function tests, lipid panels, vitamin levels, chemistry, haematology and 
coagulation were measured at regular intervals.  
•  Liver function tests 
The mean values for LFT parameters were generally within normal ranges at all visits during the 
Treatment Period during study 113 and 115.  
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115 
A total of n=7 patients had elevated transaminases in the parent studies. All the AEs associated with 
elevated transaminases were mild in severity, and none of them were serious or led to discontinuation 
of study drug.  
Among the 7 subjects with TEAEs of elevated transaminases, the median (range) time-to-onset of the 
first AESI was 57 (1 to 120) days 
For comparison, one patient in the placebo group of study 115 had an AE associated with elevated 
transaminase. 
• 
Long term safety Study 116 
In study 116, a total of n=10 (7.7%) had at least 1 elevated transaminase event. In 3 cases they were 
of severe intensity. In one patient, it resulted in a serious related adverse event. In n=1 case led to a 
treatment interruption and n=2 cases this led to a treatment discontinuation (1.5%) (table 50).

The two subjects that discontinued treatment had elevated transaminase before dosing in the parent 
study. Both subjects experienced nonserious transaminase elevation that led to discontinuation of 
study treatment. They did not receive treatments for these events.  
Among the 10 subjects with AESIs of elevated transaminases, the median (range) time-to-onset of the 
first AESI was 209.5 (16 to 420) days.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for elevated transaminase AEs was lower in Study 116 than in the 
parent studies TEZ/IVA groups (12.89 versus 24.68 events per 100PY).

Ophthalmologic Evaluations 
In the parent studies, no cases of cataract possible related to study medication were reported. 
In the long-term study 116, a total of 2 patients experienced cataracts, possibly related with study 
medication. 
Electrocardiogram results 
In the parent studies (Study 113B and Study 115), no male subjects had QTcF >450 msec, and no 
female subjects had QTcF >470 msec. No subject had a maximum QTcF change >60 msec. In Study 
116, 2 subjects met the criterion of QTcF >450 msec for a male, or QTcF >470 for a female. 
Safety in special populations 
The proposed posology is not evaluated in the current study. Weight cutoff-based dosing was used in 
Studies 113 and 115 with a weight cutoff of 40 kg. Upon review of the exposure data from these 
studies, an integrated analysis of data was performed. Following review of available data, a 30 kg 
weight cut-off was proposed for CF patients 6 through 11 years of age in order to have the best 
matched TEZ and IVA exposures to the exposures in subjects 12 years and older. 
For subjects 6 through 11 years of age who weighed <40 kg and received low dose TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 
75 mg q12h, TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower range of observed exposures 
of subjects 12 years and older. M1-TEZ exposures were similar to those of subjects 12 years and older. 
Based on additional simulations, using a 30 kg weight cutoff, the majority of PK exposures are 
predicted to be within the adult reference range (5th to 95th percentiles) for TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA, 
with the median TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures more similar to the median exposures seen in 
subjects 12 years of age and older than upon applying a 40-kg cut-off. 
To further support the proposed dosing regimen, the following safety data were also reviewed: 
1.  Bodyweight: Safety data from patients 12 to <18 years old who weighed ≤40 kg in Phase 
3 studies of TEZ/IVA and received the approved dose of TEZ/IVA (TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg 
q12h), which is the same dose patients ≥30 kg will receive with the proposed dosing regimen. 
2.  Exposure: Safety data for subjects from Study 106 and Studies 113B and 115 who had M1-TEZ 
exposure ≥95th percentile of M1-TEZ exposures in Study 106 (Section 4.2). 
Bodyweight of patients 12 to <18 years old who weighed ≤40 kg 
The safety data of the placebo-controlled integrated summary of safety (Studies 106, 107 and 108) 
were pooled for this analysis. A total of n= 199 patients aged 12 to < 18 years were included. 
The post hoc analysis included a total of n=30 patients with a body weight < 40 Kg: A total of N=13 
placebo and N=17 tezacaftor (Table 52); data from the same patients in the open-label extension 
study (study 110) through 96 weeks were also evaluated.  
A total of N=30 patients 12 to <18 years old weighed ≤40 kg and received TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 
mg q12h. TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated in these subjects, and the safety outcomes 
were consistent with the established safety profile of TEZ/IVA. No specific safety concerns were 
identified.

Table made by assessor  
Exposure to M1-TEZ ≥ 95% percentile.  
With the proposed body weight cut off of 30 kg, M1-TEZ exposures are predicted to be in the higher 
range of clinical experience in subjects 12 years and older. Therefore, the safety of TEZ/IVA was 
reviewed for subjects with M1-TEZ exposures ≥95th percentile of M1-TEZexposures in Study 106. 
• 
In Study 106, there were 10 subjects with M1-TEZ exposures ≥95th percentile who had AEs. 
Of the 10 subjects, 3 had SAEs (2 subjects with SAEs of infective PEx of CF and 1 subject with 
an SAE of musculoskeletal chest pain; both assessed not related to study drug), none had 
Grade 3/4 AEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or interruption. The AEs profile of 
these 10 subjects was generally consistent with the overall population of Study 106.

• 
In Studies 113 and 115, there were 4 subjects (3 in Study 113B and 1 subject in Study 115) who 
had M1-TEZ exposures ≥95th percentile of M1-TEZ exposures in Study 106. None of these subjects 
had SAEs, Grade 3/4 AEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or interruption. The AEs 
profile of these 4 subjects was generally consistent with the overall population of Studies 113 and 
115. 
Time and dose dependency of observed liver function test abnormalities of the N=10 
patients in the parent studies 
In Study 113B and 115, there were 10 subjects who received TEZ/IVA with ALT or AST elevations >3 
× ULN. Post hoc, the elevations in ALT, AST and bilirubin were summarized by TEZ and combined TEZ 
and M1-TEZ according to the exposure quartiles defined by the adult population.  
Among the 10 subjects with ALT or AST elevations > 3 x ULN, a total of n=8 of patients had combined 
M1-TEZ+TEZ exposure below the median exposure (as defined by the exposure in adults populations), 
while none of the patients with exposure ≥ 5 x ULN had an exposure > the adult median.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
• 
Parent studies 113 and study 115 
One patient in study 113B prematurely left the trial because of constipation. The constipation was not 
likely to be related to treatment.  
• 
Long term safety 116 
A total of n=2 (1.5%) of patients had AE that leaded to treatment discontinuation. The patients 
discontinued treatment because of transaminase elevation, which were considered by the investigator 
to be possibly related to study drug. Both subjects had elevated transaminase levels prior to dosing in 
the parent study.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for AEs leading to TEZ/IVA discontinuation was similar between 
Study 116 (2.45 events per 100PY) and the parent studies (2.47 events per 100PY). 
Adverse events leading to interruption of the drug 
• 
Parent studies 113 and 115 
In study 113, a total of 4 subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. A total of 2 patients had 
AEs that were considered related or possibly related to study drug (1 subject with an AE of blood 
creatinine phosphokinase increased and 1 subject with AEs of ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT increased). No 
related AE that led to treatment interruption was serious. All related AEs that led to interruption 
resolved without any treatment. 
No AE that led to treatment interruption occurred in ≥2 subjects. No treatment interruptions occurred 
in study 115. 
• 
Long term safety 116 
In study 116, 8 (6.2) patients experience AE’s that led to treatment interruption. All treatment 
interruptions occurred by PT in n=1 patient. In one patient, the treatment was interrupted because of 
ALT increased. No AEs leading to interruption occurred in ≥2 subjects. 
The exposure-adjusted event rate for AEs that led to treatment interruption was lower in Study 116 
(9.21 events per 100 PY) than in the parent studies (19.74 events per 100PY).

Cumulative safety  
In the cumulative safety database, a total of 13 patients (9.5%) interrupted therapy. TEAES that 
resulted to treatment interruption observed in 2 patients was ALT increased, and blood CK increased. 
All other AE were mentioned in one patient.  
Post-marketing experience 
Post-marketing surveillance of 6- through 11-year-old patients taking TEZ/IVA with the proposed 
posology has been ongoing in the US since approval on 21 June 2019 for patients ≥6 years of age. 
Over 600 patients 6 through 11 years of age have initiated treatment with TEZ/IVA in the US. The 
results of post-marketing surveillance are consistent with clinical studies, and no new safety concerns 
have been identified.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety database for TEZ/IVA treated children aged 6-11 years is defined by the parent 
studies 113B (n=70) and study 115 (n=54) and consists of a total of 124 patients. In the long-term 
safety 116 a total of 129 subjects are exposed for > 48 weeks while in the cumulative set a total of 37 
subjects are exposed for > 96 weeks.  
The provided safety sets provide enough patients with a treatment duration of >48 (n=129) to support 
the application. However, the safety data set has also some limitations i.e. it will not provide clinical 
data for the applied posology for children weighing 30-40 kg. This affects about 40% of the EU target 
population. Furthermore, the comparison with placebo is limited to the 10 F/F patients that were 
treated for 8 weeks during the study 115. The safety data set mainly exists of data collected in an 
uncontrolled, open label study period which is biased by the longer disease duration.  
As no clinical safety data has been provided to support the proposed posology, the safety assessment 
will be based on the data of the currently provided safety data base, the data obtained in adults, other 
provided data and additional measurements that can be taken to mitigate the risk.  
The provided safety data sets show that the treatments were generally well-tolerated, and the 
reported adverse events appear to be in line with the adult’s safety database. Most of the adverse 
events were of mild intensity. 
The exposure-adjusted event rate for SAEs was higher in Study 116 (33.76 events per 100PY) and 
cumulative safety set (n=31 (30.50 event/100 PY) than in the parent studies TEZ/IVA groups (17.27 
events per 100PY). According to the applicant, this might be adjusted to the unusually low rate of SAE 
in the parent studies when comparing the data with the reported exposure adjusted SAE rate of 42.77 
event per 100 PY reported in the placebo group in study 809-109 that led to the approval of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the same age group. The observed exposure adjusted event rate of study 116 
(33.76 event/100 PY) remains below this rate (42.77 events/100 PY).  
The number of treatments related adverse events appeared to be consistent for the parent studies and 
the long-term safety study (23.8%). Additionally, the treatment appeared to be well tolerated as the 
number of patients that discontinued over time was low (n=3, 2.2%). A total of 2 patients 
discontinued because of non-serious elevations of transaminases in the long-term safety study. These 
patients had also elevated transaminases before the start of the parent study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 102/120 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported AE related to medication was elevated transaminases (occurring in 10% 
of subjects in the cumulative treatment-emergent period [median exposure duration: 76 weeks]), an 
incidence being higher than that observed in subjects 12 years of age and older (3.2%). These 
observations are consistent available in the published literature that indicates transaminase elevations 
are more common in younger patients with CF than in adults and are in line with the observed 
frequency in the placebo arm of study VX14-809-109 of shorter treatment duration of 26 weeks.  
Various additional a post-hoc analyses were provided to show the correlation between treatment 
exposure and adverse events, including the transaminase elevations. These analyses were conducted 
because of the request for a higher posology and the possible correlation with treatment. These 
additional analyses failed to show a correlation, indicating that such correlating might not be strong. 
However, the analyses were hampered by the fact that they were conducted in a limited number of 
patients. Therefore, the concern remains that with a higher exposure, this AE of transaminase 
elevation will occur more frequently.  
Nevertheless, as a possible association between transaminase elevation and treatment cannot be 
excluded for CFTR correctors/potentiators. Recommendations for liver test monitoring at initiation and 
periodically during treatment, with recommendations to discontinue or interrupt treatment in the 
presence of abnormal liver function are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The applicant proposes to collect additional safety data for the proposed posology in study 116B, and 
the post-marketing study, study 117. 
In study 116B, the included study population is collected from part A of the study i.e. the patients who 
have already received treatment for 96 weeks and are willing to give informed consent. Patients who 
permanently discontinued treatment because of elevated transaminases or a positive re-challenge 
could not be included.  
Study 117 is not designed to collect adverse events. It will provide limited safety data for major 
adverse event and may probably not register the number of patients that discontinue or interrupt 
treatment because of modest transaminase elevations. 
2.6.2.   Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the use of TEZ/IVA in subjects 6 through 11 years of age with CF, homozygous for F508Del 
was generally well tolerated. The safety outcomes were generally consistent with the background 
profile in patients with CF and the established safety profile of TEZ/IVA.  
No clinical data has been provided to support the proposed weight-based posology in children weighing 
30-40 kg which will results in a higher exposure in these children compared to the clinical studies.  This 
should affect about 40% of the target population.  
In line with previous applications in paediatric CF, more paediatric patients showed elevations in 
transaminases compared to adults.  
Additional post-hoc analyses failed to show a correlation between exposure and elevated 
transaminases, but these additional analyses are hampered by the limited number of patients included.  
Considering that a treatment-related effect of transaminase elevations could not be excluded, the 
SmPC includes recommendations that for liver test monitoring at initiation and periodically during 
treatment, with recommendations to discontinue or interrupt treatment in the presence of abnormal 
liver function.

With respect to study 117, the study duration is currently defined for the 5 year-period from 2018 
through to 2022 with the final report due for submission in 2023. The applicant confirmed that at the 
time of the planned analysis of the study, they intend on having 3 years of post-marketing data from 
the US and 2 years of post-marketing data from European patients. This would therefore mean that 
paediatric patients recruited within the registry study following approval of this extension of indication 
would only be followed for a much more limited duration (no longer than 2 years for the majority of 
the European cohorts) which would not be considered sufficient. 
Consequently, the Applicant agreed to discuss in consultation with the EMA/PRAC Rapporteur the need 
for a longer follow-up at the time of the planned final analysis of study 117.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.0 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the approval of the new population of children from the age of 6 years, the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for tezacaftor/ ivacaftor needs to be amended 
as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data 
lock point will be 11 February 2021.  
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 107/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This procedure is to extend the indication to include patients of 6 years to less than 12 years. The MAH 
confirms that updates as a result of this procedure do not impact the readability of the package leaflet 
and that further readability testing is not considered necessary. Readability testing was previously 
conducted for the Symkevi 100 mg/150 mg film-coated tablets package leaflet and reviewed during 
the initial application, procedure EMEA/H/C/004682. According to the applicant updates made to the 
package leaflets are minimal, and the structure and guidance for caregivers remains aligned to the 
principles agreed on in procedure EMEA/H/C/004682. 
2.9.2.  Amendments to the Product information 
This application introduced changes in the PI as follows:  
- Update of SmPC and PI to add the new strength (TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg) and the corresponding 
extension of indication in children from the age of 6 years. 
Therefore, amendments to annex I, II, IIIA, IIIB are introduced. 
- Update of SmPC and PI for the existing strength ((TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg) to add an extension of 
the existing patient population to include children from the age of 6years. 
Therefore, amendments to annex I, and IIIB are introduced. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication of the present application is as follows: (changes in bold and underlined) 
Symkevi tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508Del mutation 
or who are heterozygous for the F508Del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the 
CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, 
D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene 
that result in the absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface that regulates salt 
and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport results in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. At very young ages 
clinically apparent lung disease may be absent although lung structural changes may be already 
present and progressing. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most CF therapies target the symptoms of the disease, such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, 
and mucolytics. A few years ago, CFTR modulators became available which have the potency to modify 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 108/120 
 
 
 
the progress of the disease as they improve the underlying pathophysiological caused, the defective 
CFTR- function. Two CFTR modulators are approved for the treatment of CF in the EU in children aged 
≥ 6 years, Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor).  
Symkevi is approved for adolescents and children aged ≥ 12 years. Kaftrio is approved for adolescents 
and adult patients with homozygous F508del mutations and heterozygous patients with minimal 
function mutations. 
The current application applies for an extension of the indication for Symkevi in children aged ≥ 6 
years in CF patients homozygous for F508/F508 and for heterozygous for F508/ and certain residual 
mutations. 
Homozygous F508/F508 
The currently applied indication for Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) partly overlaps with the approved indication of 
Orkambi referring to homozygous F508Del patients. However, the extension of the TEZ/IVA indication 
to patients 6 through 11 years old would provide an alternative treatment option for the homozygous 
F/F patients because not all patients tolerate Orkambi well due to adverse events (e.g. 
bronchoconstriction, liver function impairment). Orkambi is also a strong CYP3A inducer which may 
lead to unwanted drug-drug interactions with commonly prescribed medications whereas Symkevi is a 
less strong inducer. 
Heterozygous F508/RF 
The extension of the applied indication may fill an unmet medication need for patients with F/RF 
mutation aged 6-11 years old. This patient group represents about 9% of the CF population for whom 
no other CFTR modulators have been approved. These patients are characterised by slower disease 
progression than the homozygous F508 population, but they will eventually experience the clinical 
consequences of CF, including a reduced lifespan. 
The applied posology for Symkevi is:  
Age 
Morning (1 tablet) 
Evening (1 tablet) 
6 to <12 years weighing < 30 kg 
tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg 
ivacaftor 75 mg 
6 to <12 years weighing ≥ 30 kg 
tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 
ivacaftor 150 mg 
≥ 12 years 
tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg 
ivacaftor 150 mg 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal efficacy study is study VX16-661-115 (study 115), and the safety study is study VX15-661-
113 (study 113). Study 115 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in paediatric patients aged 6-11 years. The included CF 
patients were confirmed to be homozygous for F508Del-CFTR or F508/residual function. 
This application is based on partial extrapolation considering the similarities in the genetic, molecular 
and pathophysiological aetiology of CF between adults and children during the disease as outlined in 
the principles described in ICH E11 and the EMA reflection paper on paediatric extrapolation. 
Indeed, this strategy of partial extrapolation can be justified in CF for the CFTR therapies, because of 
the similar underlying genetic, and molecular aetiology of CF between children and patients ≥ 12 
years. The biochemical defect of the defective chloride channels is present from birth and because of 
the longstanding defects, it results in sequelae in the lung, pancreas and other organs emerging 
progressively throughout childhood and into adulthood. These sequelae may negatively affect the 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 109/120 
 
 
 
 
course of the disease over time, e.g. like the more frequent exacerbations is adulthood compared to 
childhood. The CFTR therapies improve the Cl transport, and as such, they can be regarded as a 
targeted therapy for the disease for which the extrapolation strategy is justified.  
Additionally, experience with previous CFTR-applications like ivacaftor((Kalydeco) and 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi) established the role of these therapies in children aged 6-11 years in a 
comparative placebo-controlled phase III randomised trial. It was unknown whether the clinical course 
of the disease might be different between adults and children at that time. These studies showed 
efficacy results that were in line with the adult population, supporting the concept of partial 
extrapolation.  
In summary, the partial extrapolation approach to establish the treatment in paediatric population for 
Symkevi is therefore acceptable considering the existing scientific knowledge in paediatric patients with 
CF and with other CFTR modulators.  
The table below summarises the main studies included in the extrapolation strategy.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study VX16-661-115 the primary efficacy outcome, the within-group (TEZ/IVA group) change in 
LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 8, was LS mean (SE) -0.51 (0.11) (95% CI: -0.74 to -0.29; P 
<0.0001).  
The upper bound of the 95% CI (-0.29) was below the pre-specified maximum placebo effect of -0.10.  
The key secondary outcomes and other outcomes (ppFEV1 and CFQR) show within treatment 
(TEZ/IVA) improvements from baseline through week 8 as well:  
- Sweat chloride: LS mean (SE) -12.3 (1.5) (95% CI -15.3, -9.3) mmol. L-1, p<0.0001.  
- CFQ-R Respiratory domain: LS mean (SE) 2.3 (1.2) (95% CI -0.1, 4.6); p=0.0546 
- Percentage predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1): LS mean (SE) 2.8 (0.9) (95% CI 1.0, 4.6); p=0.0024. 
Improvements in primary and secondary outcome measures were observed in both populations of 
F508/F508 and F508/RF. 
The additional sensitivity analyses for the LCI 2.5 (MMRM with placebo mean imputation) showed LCI 
2.5 baseline through week 8 for F/F: LS mean (SE) -0.32 (0.12) (95% CI -0.56, -0.07); for the F/RF: -
1.07 (0.21) (95% CI -1.49, -0.64)  
The long-term supportive study 113B showed an improvement in ppFEV1 and LCI2.5 from baseline 
through week 24 without signs of deterioration over time. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No dedicated dose-finding Phase II trial has been conducted in the paediatric population. The applicant 
applied for a higher posology for patients weighing >30 and < 40 kg than currently investigated in trial 
115. No clinical data has been provided for this posology adjustment which will impact about 40% of 
the proposed EU target population. Upon request from CHMP, additional PK/PD relationships were 
provided showing that under the new applied posology, the sweat chloride transport will increase by 
0.8 mmol/L. This likely also improves the LCI2.5, but the actual effect size remains uncertain. 
The treatment duration of the pivotal study 115 is relatively short (8 weeks). The duration is justified 
as previous efficacy studies with CFTR modulator/potentiator showed that the improvement observed 
in children at week 8 was maintained during long term follow-up to 24 weeks.  
The paediatric population included a different patient population (F508/F508 and F508/RF) compared 
to the two adult pivotal trials (two trials, one for each population). These difference in the trial 
population may hinder the extrapolation because the clinical course might be different in these two 
populations. On the other hand, Symkevi modulates the CFTR receptor in both populations to the same 
extent as shown in the adult data for sweat chloride.  
The observed LS mean (SE) improvement in sweat chloride is small -12.3 (1.5) mmol.L-1 but above the  
identified MCID of -10 mmol/L, and in line with the adult's data (F/F -10.1 mmol/L and F/RF -
9.5 mmol/l).  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021  
Page 111/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The MMRM analyses assume that patients who do not provide data (n= 6) at week 8 continue to 
benefit from treatment. Additional analyses using the placebo-mean imputation showed smaller 
effects, but the point estimate still pointed towards a beneficial effect.  
For the F/F population the cross-study comparisons with placebo show a smaller effect in terms of 
sweat chloride and LCI2.5 with TEZ/IVA when indirectly compared with LUM/IVA.  
Cross study comparison:  
-  Mean (SD) LCI2.5: -1.07 (95% CI -1.42, -0.71) vs. -0.71 (95% CI -1.28, -0.13) U in LUM/IVA 
and TEZ/IVA, respectively 
-  Mean (SD) sweat chloride: -25.6 (95% CI -28.6, -22.5) vs -10.7 (95% CI -18.5, -2.9) 
mmol.L-1 in LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA, respectively 
In terms of the ppFEV1, the results with TEZ/IVA showed a better effect compared with LUM/IVA, i.e., 
2.6 (7.0) versus 0.5 (8.1) percentage points respectively. 
The results of the open-label study 113 are hard to interpret, as patients show initially, a small, 
clinically irrelevant deterioration of LCI2.5. At the end of the study, the LCI2.5 has returned to baseline. 
The absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 24 was (LS mean (95% CI) 0.09 (-0.32, 
0.49). Nevertheless, the study does not show a deterioration of efficacy over time.  
The patients were selected on the availability to swallow the tablet. This may have biased the drug 
acceptability results towards a more favourable outcome.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main safety data set included 137 patients, among them 129 patients with an exposure ≥ 48 
weeks. Most frequently reported AEs are cough (58.4%), followed by infective pulmonary exacerbation 
of CF (43.8%), and pyrexia (24.1%). 
The most frequently treatment-related reported AE was transaminase elevation. The observed 
incidence of ALT and AST elevations appeared to be higher (7.7%) in this paediatric population than in 
subjects 12 years of age and older (3.2%).  
A higher number of SAE’s /100 patient-years were reported in the long-term safety study 116 (n=27, 
20.8%) compared to the parent studies 115 and 113 (n=6, 4.8%).  
A total of 8 (6.2%) patients interrupted treatment over time; 2 (1.5%) patients interrupted because of 
transaminase elevations.  
Two patients (1.5%) discontinued treatment and both were because of nonserious transaminase 
elevations.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data set mainly consist of data collected in an uncontrolled, open label study period in which 
the contribution from the longer disease duration versus the longer drug exposure is hard to 
distinguish. 
Cross study comparisons with the placebo arm of study 809-109 in the same F/F target population 
showed that the incidence of transaminase elevations is in the range of 10% and SAE’s were 
comparable as the one observed in the current study.  
The applied posology will result in a higher exposure in patients weighting between 30- 40 kg. No

clinical data for the proposed posology for patients weighing 30-40 kg is available. This lack of data 
affects about 40% of the EU target population. 
Additional post hoc analyses failed to show a correlation between exposure and elevated 
transaminases, but the data is obtained in only a small number of patients, therefore no conclusion can 
be reached.  
An association between the Symkevi and drug-induced liver function test cannot be excluded. 
Therefore, section 4.4. of the SmPC includes recommendations for liver test monitoring at initiation 
and periodically during treatment, with recommendations to discontinue or interrupt treatment in the 
presence of abnormal liver function.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Symkevi is a CFTR modulator which specifically targets CFTR dysfunction, the basic pathophysiological 
defect in CF. This defective dysfunction has the same genetic and molecular aetiology in both 
paediatrics and adults. These similarities in disease might justify the use of a partial extrapolation 
strategy to establish the efficacy and safety of Symkevi in paediatric CF patients. Therefore, limited 
efficacy and safety data in the paediatric population could be accepted, and the main efficacy and 
safety data can be extrapolated from the adult’s data. Also, the reduced clinical program decreases the 
number of children participating in clinical studies.  
Symkevi is regarded as targeted therapy. As such, it has the potential to improve the natural course of 
the disease over time. Therefore, early initiation of treatment might be important, as it may prevent 
irreversible changes of disease.  
Symkevi is approved for CF patients ≥ 12 years harbouring a homozygous for F508/F508 and 
heterozygous for F508/ certain residual functions.  
Upon approval in the paediatric population (i.e. from 6 to 11 years old), Symkevi would be the second 
CFTR modulator for younger patients with F508/F508. It provides an alternative for those patients who 
cannot tolerate Orkambi because of respiratory side effects or because of certain drug/drug 
interactions. Symkevi will be the first CFTR modulator for paediatric patients who harbour certain F/RF 
mutations. 
The clinical program to support the paediatric application is based on partial extrapolation of the adult 
data to the paediatric population. The concept of partial extrapolation is based on the fact that the 
Symkevi PK in adults is predictive of the PK in paediatric data and the drug has a predictive, similar 
pharmacodynamic effect in both populations. In addition, paediatric clinical data were gathered to 
support the extrapolated adult efficacy and safety data.  
Throughout the clinical program, PK data was collected. After reviewing the totality of data, it appeared 
that for children weighing 30-40 kg, the TEZ parent and IVA parent exposures fell within the lower 
range of observed exposures of subjects 12 years and older. Therefore, the applicant adjusted the 
proposed posology (weight cut-off of 30kg), to align with the adult exposure. This adjustment affects 
about 40% of the target EU population. The clinical package does not contain clinical data to provide 
evidence for this posology however PK/PD simulation data provided during assessment supports the 
proposed posology which is agreed.  
Despite the lower exposure in patients 30-40 kg in the studies, the conducted paediatric studies 
showed a pharmacodynamic effect, i.e. an improvement in the sweat chloride that was similar to the 
effect observed in adults. In addition, the additional PK/PD modelling showed that the applied posology 
will likely improve the Cl transport with 0.8 mmol/L, further support the efficacy for the higher 
posology.  
Based on the similar PK and pharmacodynamics effects in both populations, extrapolation of the 
efficacy and safety in the approved adult indication to the paediatric population is considered 
acceptable. Moreover, extrapolation is supported by limited paediatric data available. 
The pivotal study 115, met its primary endpoint by showing a within treatment difference in the LCI2.5 
from baseline through week 8 that was highly statistically significant, while the 95% CI did not cross 
the predefined boundary with placebo. The effect was supported with an improvement in the FEV1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021 
Page 116/120 
 
 
  
Additional sensitivity analyses supported the observed improvement as the point estimate showed a 
favourable effect. These data show that, like in adults, TEZ/IVA modulates the CFTR function in 
paediatrics. This modulation will result in improved lung function.  
The observed improvement in the LCI2.5 is within the normal variability of the disease. Nevertheless, 
this improvement can be regarded as clinically relevant as it is supported with data in the older 
population ≥ 12 years obtained with Symkevi. Previous adult applications (Bronchitol (EMEA/H/C 
001251), Orkambi (EMEA/H/C/003954) and Symkevi (EMEA/H/C/004682) also showed lung function 
improvements that were within the normal variability of FEV1.These improvements were regarded as 
clinically relevant, considering the detrimental course of the disease. Statistically significant effects in 
ppFEV1 and sweat chloride supported the clinical relevance of Symkevi treatment in the paediatric 
population. 
Relevant clinical effects were observed for both the F/F group and F/RF group, although the overall 
treatment effect in the LCI2.5 appeared to be driven by the F/RF population. The cross-study 
comparisons showed that the observed treatment effects for the F/F population were somewhat 
smaller compared to the treatment effect observed with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in this homozygous 
population.  
 The effect on LCI can be regarded as relevant as it was supported with improvements in FEV1 and 
sweat chloride transport and clinical data obtained in adults (study VX-116 -106). 
However,  cross study comparisons with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the same target population showed 
larger improvements. Therefore, the CHMP recommended reporting the results of both subgroups in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to provide information on each population RF and F/F which would be 
relevant for the prescriber.  
In the clinical program, Symkevi appeared to be well-tolerated, both in the short term and in the long-
term safety studies. The most frequently reported related adverse event was transaminase elevation. 
However, as the safety database mainly consisted of open, label uncontrolled data, it is not possible to 
draw definite conclusions due to the lack of placebo-controlled arm and the bias in the results due to 
the contribution to the disease. Cross study comparisons showed that the observed frequency of 
elevated transaminase (~ 10%) of the long-term safety database of 75-week duration was in line with 
the placebo arm of a comparative trial of 24-week duration (VX14-809-109). Although a correlation 
with treatment cannot be excluded, this comparison suggests that this adverse event can also be 
attributed to CF, as elevated transaminases are frequently observed in paediatric CF.  
No clinical data has been provided to support the safety for the higher, proposed posology. This 
proposed posology may affect about 40% of the proposed EU target population. Concerns were raised, 
if the higher exposure would increase the risk of transaminase elevations. Various post hoc analyses 
were conducted but failed to show such a correlation. Although these analyses included a limited 
number of patients, together with the long-term safety database they provided enough support for the 
higher applied posology. Additionally, recommendations to monitor the liver function prior and during 
treatment are included in the SmPC section 4.4.  
 Balance of benefits and risks 
In the paediatric clinical program, Symkevi showed a similar improvement in the sweat chloride in 
paediatrics compared to adults. The observed pharmacodynamic improvement was associated with 
statistically significant and relevant improvement in lung functions in both the F/F and F/RF population, 
improvements that are supported with the lung function improvements obtained in the adult's 
population. The treatment appeared well tolerated. Overall the data support extension of indication in 
children above 6 years and approval of the new strength (TEZ 50mg/ IVA 75mg) of Symkevi tablets.  
Assessment report  
EMA/48399/2021 
Page 117/120 
 
 
  
 
From the PK point of view, the posology investigated in studies 113B and study 115 resulted in TEZ 
and IVA exposures at the lower end of that seen in older patients i.e. children weighting 30 to less 
than 40 kg. Therefore, the MAH proposed to shift the body weight cut-off for dosing from 40 kg to 30 
kg, i.e., children weighing ≥30 kg will be treated with the adult dose of TEZ 100mg qd/IVA 150 mg 
q12h which is expected to result in a more comparable systemic exposure. This proposed posology 
which has not been tested in the paediatric clinical studies (i.e., in children weighing at least 30 kg to 
less than 40 kg) is supported with additional PK/PD analyses as well with the longer-term safety and 
post-hoc analyses that contribute to alleviate the concerns regarding the potential for increased 
systemic exposure and risk of transaminase elevations.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Symkevi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Symkevi is not similar to Bronchitol, TobiPodhaler, 
Kalydeco, Kaftrio within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Symkevi 50/75 mg is favourable in the following indication: 
Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of patients with 
cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508Del mutation or who are 
heterozygous for the F508Del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Symkevi subject to 
the following conditions:

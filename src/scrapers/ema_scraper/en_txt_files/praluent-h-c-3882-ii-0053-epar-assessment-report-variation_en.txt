1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, sanofi-aventis groupe submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 21 October 2019 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

competent authority 
Submission of the final report from study DFI14223, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP in order to 
fulfil MEA 029. The submission serves also to comply with article 46 of the regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 
(as amended). This is an 8-week open label, sequential, repeated dose-finding study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety and PK profile of alirocumab in children and adolescents with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia followed by an extension phase.  
The requested variation proposed no amendments to the Product Information. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
A phase 2, open-label dose finding study in heterozygous familiar hypercholesteraemia (HeFH) paediatric 
patients (8 to 17 years of age) on top of statins or in statin intolerance to evaluate appropriate doses to 
be selected for the phase 3 studies including a study in homozygous familiar hypercholesterolaemia 
(HoFH) patients and a study in HeFH patients has been conducted and submitted in accordance with 
article 46 of the regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 (as amended). No changes to the SmPC are proposed. 
Patients were dosed according to body weight which is acceptable considering that body weight is a 
significant covariate on the exposure of alirocumab in adults. For the 42 patients included, doses of 30 
and 40 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) were tested for body weight (BW) < 50 kg and 50 and 75 mg for BW > 
50 kg, and 75 and 150 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) for BW < 50 kg and 150 and 300 mg Q4W for BW> 50 
kg  in four cohorts (2 cohorts with Q2W regimen and 2 cohorts with Q4W regimen). 
The mean Ctrough levels (exposure) observed in the pediatric population receiving alirocumab Q2W 
doses and the lowest dose cohort on Q4W dose were close to adults exposures. However, exposure for the 
highest Q4W dose in the BW ≥ 50 kg subgroup (300 mg) was substantially higher than observed in adults 
(17880 ng/mL vs 8620ng/ml). Although the mean Ctrough alirocumab concentration was higher, the 
exposure range of these patients of cohort 4 was within the exposure range observed for the adult 
population with the same dose and bodyweight category. The results observed with the cohort 4 300 mg 
Q4W dose should however be interpreted with caution, as only 5 pediatric patients were treated with this 
alirocumab dose, compared to 458 adult patients who received the same dosing regimen in study CHOICE 
I. Nevertheless, the higher exposure of alirocumab observed in the 5 children and adolescents with BW ≥ 
50 kg can likely be mainly attributed to the lower body weight of the children as compared to the body 
weight of the overall adult population in the CHOICE I study.  
For the genetically and clinically confirmed HeFH patients with mean baseline LDL-C levels of 4.6 mmol/L, 
the higher Q2W dose showed greater reductions in LDL-C (-46.1%) as compared to the lower Q2W dose 
(-21.1%), although slight differences appear in the effect according to body weight (-40.6  [sd13.2] with 
40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg, and -49.8% [standard deviation:10.6] with 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg). For 
Assessment report

the monthly dosing, only a moderate effect was observed for the lower dosing (cohort 3: 75 mg and 150 
mg QW4), with respectively -17.5% (10.3) and 4.0% (11.2) after 8 weeks. Based on these results, 
subsequent dosing with higher doses (cohort 4) showed greater efficacy (-31.9% [10.3] with 150 mg 
Q4W for BW <50 kg, and -59.8% [11.2] with 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg), although with variability in 
effect according to BW. Other endpoints supported the primary endpoint across the efficacy effects for the 
different cohorts including absolute change in LDL-C (-1.296, -1.947, -0.456 and -2.017 mmol/L, 
respectively cohort 1 to 4), proportion of patients achieving pre-specified LDL-C targets (3.37 mmol/L 
target: 60%, 89%, 27%, 72%; 2.84 mmol/L target: 0%, 77%, 18%, 72%), LDL-C reduction and end of 
the open-label extension phase (-23%, -52%, -23% and –48%) as well as PCSK9 level monitoring. 
Overall, a more pronounced effect can be observed in the higher Q2W dose and in the higher Q4W dosing 
in comparison to the respective lower dose groups. Although some variation exists between the body 
weight categories, with greater efficacy in the BW ≥50 kg groups. Exposure data are in agreement with 
these LDL-C efficacy observations and may thus likely explain the observed differences, although no 
exposure response data have been presented.  
With regard to safety, the database was very limited to address the safety profile in paediatric patients. 
Adverse events were generally in line with those observed for adult patients. Serious events were not 
reported, which is reassuring. It can be reasonably supported that the two events of diabetes mellitus 
were not considered treatment related, although it is expected that such events of special interest will 
also be monitored during the phase 3 studies as an effect on glucose and diabetes mellitus has been 
observed in adults. No other relevant unexpected laboratory abnormalities were observed.  
Based on the comparison of the preliminary efficacy data from children in cohort 4 of study DFI14223 (in 
pediatric patients with BW (≥50 kg)) and the adult subgroup (50 to 80 kg) from CHOICE I study 
comparable efficacy of LDL-C reduction is achieved with the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W dose (-59% vs 
-67%). Although a higher exposure is observed, it can reasonably be expected that this will likely not 
emerge to important safety issues, as no exposure dependent adverse events are known with the use of 
alirocumab. For instance, no difference in safety profile is kwown between different doses previously 
examined. Based on this consideration, it is acceptable to have taken this dose further to be evaluated in 
the ongoing study EFC14643.  Further safety data will be generated in study EFC14643 to confirm the 
safety profile in this paediatric population. 
Overall, it is reasonable to have considered the higher Q2W and Q4W doses and taken them forward to 
the phase 3 studies (already ongoing). The company is expected to present a combined overview of all 
pharmacokinetic data in the paediatric population, upon completion of all paediatric studies. It is agreed 
that current data are premature to consider these to be included in the SmPC. 
The benefit-risk balance of Praluent remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
Background on the product 
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to proprotein 
convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Alirocumab increases the number of LDLR available for 
removing LDL-C from the circulation by blocking PCSK9 from binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(LDLR). Alirocumab lowers LDL-C and reduces the risk of CVD. Currently, alirocumab has been approved 
in the EU  for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults. 
Alirocumab is also approved for the prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with established 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the EU. 
Background on the disease 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism, characterized by severely 
elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that lead to premature atherosclerosis and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD).  
Familial hypercholesterolemia is most clearly documented to have important cardiovascular 
consequences beginning in childhood. Even though cardiovascular events are rare in childhood, children 
with heterozygous FH (heFH) already have functional and morphological changes of the vessel wall 
illustrated by an impaired flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and an increased intima media 
thickness of the carotid artery (cIMT), with a progression rate for cIMT of approximately double to that 
observed in unaffected siblings. Both are surrogate markers for atherosclerotic vascular disease and, 
thus, indicate that the atherosclerotic process is initiated early in childhood. Indeed, there is evidence 
that lesions of atherosclerosis found in adults begin in childhood and are progressive throughout the life 
span. These findings suggest that to be effective at preventing coronary heart disease (CHD), prevention 
must begin decades prior to the onset of symptoms. 
Because of the high risk of progression to premature clinical CVD associated with these findings, pediatric 
guidelines recommend LDL-C lowering intervention and specific lipid targets for children and adolescents 
with heFH. An LDL-C level <130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) is considered acceptable and <110 mg/dL (2.85 
mmol/L) ideal for children with heFH, or the achievement of ≥50% reduction in LDL-C. Pediatric 
guidelines recommend LDL-C lowering intervention to start with statins first. However, not all patients 
can achieve target LDL-C reductions with currently available lipid modifying therapies (LMTs). Therefore, 
these pediatric patients represent a group with an identified unmet medical need that could be addressed 
by adding alirocumab to their LMT. 
Study rationale 
A phase 2, dose-finding study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and the magnitude of LDL-C 
reduction with alirocumab in the heFH pediatric population and to support appropriate dose selection for 
the Phase 3 pediatric heFH and homozygous FH (hoFH) program. The current submission includes the 
results of the DFI14223 Study as per the Applicant’s postmarketing commitment (MEA/FSR 029, related 
to PIP Decision P/0047/2018). 
This study is part of the European Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP Number: EMEA-001169-PIP01-11) of 
alirocumab in the "treatment of elevated cholesterol". This PIP for alirocumab was issued by the EMA 
decision on 29 November 2013 and was subsequently modified with the EMA decision on 15 April 2016 
(P/0102/2016) to update the key features of the phase 2, dose-ranging study, DFI14223. The current PIP 
version (EMA-001169-PIP01-11M04) was approved on 19 February 2018 (Decision P/0047/2018).

A waiver for children from birth to less than 8 years was granted on the grounds that the specific 
medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. A deferral 
for one or more measures was granted for the pediatric population from 8 to less than  
18 years of age for the treatment of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. 
The agreed PIP includes 2 additional pediatric phase 3 clinical studies in children older than  
8 years with FH:  
•  An open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents 
with homozygous FH (Study EFC14660). Completion of this study is expected by no later than 
June 2021, as indicated in the PIP. 
•  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open label treatment period 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents with heFH (Study 
EFC14643). Completion of this study is expected by no later than September 2023, as indicated 
in the PIP. 
6.  Study DFI14223 - methods and study design 
General study design 
The DFI14223 study was an open-label, dose-finding, sequential group, multinational, multicenter study. 
Repeated doses of subcutaneous (SC) alirocumab were administered every 2 (Q2W) or  
4 weeks (Q4W) in children and adolescents (aged 8-17 years) with heFH having LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (3.37 
mmol/L) despite optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ± other LMTs, or a stable dose of non-statin 
LMTs in case of intolerance to statins, for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period.  
Study participant 
Key inclusion criteria 
•  Children and adolescent male and female patients aged 8 to 17 years at the time of signed 
informed consent (Russia only: aged ≥12 and ≤17 years at the time of signed informed consent) 
•  Diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) through genotyping or clinical 
criteria*. 
•  Treated with optimal dose of statin** ± other LMT(s) or non-statin LMT(s) if statin intolerant*** 
at stable dose for at least 4 weeks. 
•  Calculated LDL-C greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL (≥3.37 mmol/L) obtained during the 
screening period after the patient has been on stable LMT (ie, stable optimal dose of statin ± 
other stable LMTs or stable non-statin LMTs in statin intolerant patients) treatment for at least 4 
weeks. 
•  Body weight greater than or equal to 25 kg. 
•  Patients aged of 8 to 9 years to be at Tanner stage 1 and patients aged of 10 to 17 years to be at 
least at Tanner stage 2 in their development. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 9/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
* Diagnosis of heFH had to be made either by previous genotyping, current genotyping, or by clinical 
criteria according to Simon Broome criteria. Previous genotyping referred to documented results that 
were available from prior genotyping testing supporting a diagnosis of heFH. Current centralized 
genotyping referred to patients consenting to undergo mandatory genotyping during the screening period 
with results supporting a diagnosis of heFH. The clinical diagnosis had to be based on the Simon Broome 
criteria for possible or definite FH. Once eligibility was confirmed based on prior genetic testing or Simon 
Broome criteria, results of elective genetic testing did not impact patient’s eligibility. 
** The optimal dose of statin was defined as the stable daily dose prescribed based on regional practice 
or local guidelines or was the stable daily dose that was maximally tolerated due to AEs on higher doses. 
For patients not receiving the maximally tolerated dose of statin, statin intensification were to be carefully 
considered prior to inclusion in this study in order to ensure that the addition of a non-statin LDL-C 
lowering therapy (ie, alirocumab) would be the next appropriate step in the management of the patient’s 
hypercholesterolemia. The highest dose of statin had not to exceed the maximum labeled dose of statin 
for pediatric patients as per the local prescribing information. 
*** Statin intolerant patient was defined as the inability to tolerate at least 2 statins: one statin at the 
lowest daily starting dose, and another statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle-related symptoms, 
other than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or 
increased during statin therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued. Patients not receiving 
a daily regimen of a statin (eg, 1 to 3 times weekly) were also considered as not able to tolerate a daily 
dose. 
**** Patients age of 8 to less than 10 years had to have other available interventions to lower calculated 
LDL-C but these were insufficient. 
Key exclusion criteria 
•  Criteria not in agreement with the inclusion criteria: age of less than 8 or greater than 17 years 
at the time of signed informed consent, calculated LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) during the 
screening period, after patient has been on stable LMT for at least 4 weeks, patient without a 
diagnosis of heFH by genotyping or clinical criteria, patients aged of 8 to <10 years in whom other 
available interventions to lower LDL-C have been sufficient, patients not on a stable dose of LMT 
(including statin, as applicable) for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit and from screening 
visit to Day 1, daily dose of statin that is above the maximum recommended dose for pediatric 
patients as per the local prescribing label, body weight <25 kg, patients not previously instructed 
on a cholesterol-lowering diet prior to the screening visit, patients aged of 8 to 9 years not being 
at Tanner Stage 1 and patients aged of 10 to 17 years not being at least at Tanner Stage 2 in their 
development. 
•  Use of nutraceutical products or over the counter therapies that may affect lipids which have not 
been at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. 
•  Patients with a diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. 
•  Patient who has received lipid apheresis treatment within 2 months prior to the screening period, 
or had plans to receive it during the study. 
•  Known history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
•  Known history of thyroid disease. 
•  Known history of hypertension.

•  Fasting triglycerides >350 mg/dL (3.95 mmol/L) at the screening visit. 
•  Severe renal impairment (ie, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the screening visit). 
•  Conditions/situations or laboratory findings such as: ALT or AST >2 x ULN (1 repeat lab was 
allowed), CPK >3 x ULN (1 repeat lab was allowed), any clinically significant abnormality 
identified at the time of screening that in the judgment of the Investigator or any 
sub-Investigator would preclude safe completion of the study or constrain endpoints assessment 
such as major systemic diseases. 
•  Patients considered by the Investigator or any sub-Investigator as inappropriate for this study for 
any reason, eg: unable to meet specific protocol requirements, unable to administer or tolerate 
long-term injections 
•  Treatment with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 8 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to 
the screening period, whichever was longer. 
•  All contraindications to the background statins or other LMTs (as applicable) warning/precaution 
of use (when appropriate) as displayed in the respective National Product Labeling. 
•  Hypersensitivity to alirocumab or to any of the ingredients of alirocumab injections. 
For the extension phase the following relevant exclusion criteria were applicable: 
•  Significant protocol deviation in the main phase based on the Investigator judgment, such as 
non-compliance by the patient. 
•  Patient who experienced an adverse event leading to permanent discontinuation from the main 
open-label dose finding treatment period. 
•  Patients having any new condition or worsening of existing condition which in the opinion of the 
Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for entry into the extension phase, or could 
interfere with the patient participating in or completing the study. 
Treatments 
Cohorts 
There was a sequential enrolment into the 4 separate and independent cohorts, Cohorts 1 to 4. 
Based on the results from this dose-finding study (DFI14223), 2 doses/dosing regimen per body weight 
category were selected to be further evaluated in phase 3 pediatric studies. The rationale for the selection 
of these doses is as follows. 
Since the BW was identified as a significant covariate on alirocumab PK (through clearance), two BW 
categories (BW <50 kg and BW ≥50 kg) were determined with a fixed dosage in each BW category. 
To define the pediatric doses to be tested in the DFI14223, simulations were performed based on the final 
adult population PK model including Phase 3 data in adults. The model included BW as a covariate (on 
clearance) and allowed to perform simulations with different BW categories. The targeted lower dose to 
be tested in pediatric patients was simulated to achieve drug exposure that corresponded to the lowest 
dose evaluated in adult patients, ie, 50 mg Q2W. This 50 mg Q2W dose in adult Phase 2 resulted in 
approximately 40% LDL-C reduction. The higher dose was simulated to correspond to the lower adult 
therapeutic dose of 75 mg Q2W. Simulations were also conducted to achieve approximately 45-50% 
LDL-C reduction when alirocumab is administered monthly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 11/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on these simulations, a fixed dosage was defined per BW categories, with staggered doses of 30 
mg Q2W and 40 mg Q2W or 75mg Q4W for children with a BW below 50 kg, and doses of 50 mg Q2W and 
75 mg Q2W or 150 mg Q4W for children with a BW ≥50 kg. Given the inconclusive results observed for 
the Q4W dosing regimen evaluated in Cohort 3 (see efficacy results), an additional cohort (Cohort 4) was 
subsequently included to evaluate the Q4W dosing regimen at higher doses of 150 mg for BW <50 kg and 
300 mg for BW ≥50 kg. The intent was to determine if an effect on LDL-C closer to the therapeutic target 
of approximately 50% LDL-C reduction could be achieved with a Q4W dosing regimen. 
The treatment duration of this open-label, dose-finding treatment period was 8 weeks for the first 3 
cohorts, and 12 weeks for Cohort 4. Each independent cohort below included approximately 10 patients 
with no less than 4 patients in each BW category: 
•  Cohort 1 received 30 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 50 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg. 
•  Cohort 2 received 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg. 
•  Cohort 3 received 75 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg and 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. 
•  Cohort 4 received 150 mg Q4W for BW<50 kg and 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. 
The study included 4 periods as described below.  
Screening period  
The aim of the screening period, including a run-in period if needed, was to establish eligibility and 
consisted of a period up to 6 weeks (+1 week). Patients already on stable LMT(s) (ie, stable optimal dose 
of statin ± other stable LMTs or stable dose of non-statin LMTs in statin-intolerant patients for at least 4 
weeks prior to screening LDLC) and with heFH diagnosis confirmed by previous genetic testing or based 
on Simon Broome criteria could be enrolled within 2 weeks providing they met all other eligibility criteria. 
Patients not already on stable LMT(s) for at least 4 weeks, as defined above, had to enter a “run-in” period 
as required to meet this eligibility criterion. 
Main treatment period 
The main treatment period consisted of an open-label dose finding treatment period of 8 weeks for 
Cohorts 1 to 3, and 12 weeks for Cohort 4. In each of the 4 independent cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 4), 
alirocumab was administered via SC injections in a Q2W or Q4W dose regimen. There was a sequential 
enrollment into the 4 separate and independent cohorts. 
Post-treatment follow-up period  
Cohorts 1 to 3 had a follow-up period (off treatment) before entering in the extension period. 
The follow-up period consisted of 6 weeks for Cohort 3 or 8 weeks for Cohorts 1 and 2 after the end of the 
open label dose finding (OLDFI) treatment period visit. For these 3 cohorts, the final follow-up visit 
corresponded to 10 weeks after the last alirocumab injection administered during the open-label dose 
finding treatment period (in Cohorts 1 and 2, the last injection was at Week 6 and in Cohort 3, it was at 
Week 4).  
Open-label extension (OLE) period: (for patients who successfully completed the OLDFI period). 
At the end of the post-treatment follow-up period for Cohorts 1 to 3 and at the end of the 12-week 
open-label dose-finding treatment period for Cohort 4, patients who successfully completed the OLDFI 
period (providing they had not experienced adverse events [AEs] leading to permanent discontinuation 
during the OLDFI treatment period and had no significant protocol deviations, in the Investigator’s 
judgment) were offered entry into an optional open-label extension (OLE) period as follows: 
Assessment report

Page 12/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
o  The initial dose of alirocumab that was administered Q2W or Q4W during the OLE period, was to be a 
continuation of the same doses/dose regimen administered during the OLDFI treatment period of the 
main phase. However, after completion of the first 3 cohorts, the doses/dosing regimen evaluated in 
Cohort 2 were selected for the planned Phase 3 study in heFH pediatric patients. Subsequently, these 
doses/dosing regimens were applied to the OLE period of this study and patients in Cohorts 1 to 3 
were switched to the phase 3 doses if they were not already on the selected doses. For Cohort 4 that 
further evaluated the Q4W dosing regimen, patients remained on their initial regimen due to the 
delay in initiating this cohort and consequently the limited duration of their participation in the OLE 
period with regard to the planned study end date. 
o  All patients from all cohorts that participated in the DFI14223 study had the opportunity to enrol in 
the pediatric Phase 3 study to be conducted in the heFH pediatric population provided that they met 
the eligibility criteria. The alirocumab administrations during the OLE period continued until at least 
10 weeks (corresponding to the wash out period) before the patient’s entry into the Phase 3 pediatric 
heFH study.   
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of alirocumab administered Q2W or Q4W on 
LDL-C levels after 8 weeks of treatment in heFH patients aged of 8 to 17 years, with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL 
(3.37 mmol/L) on optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ± other LMTs or a stable dose of non-statin 
LMTs in case of intolerance to statins, for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability, the pharmacokinetics 
profile, the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters levels (ie, Total-C, calculated LDL-C, measured 
LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), non-high density lipoprotein 
(non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), ratio Apo B/Apo A-1, lipoprotein (a) 
(Lp[a]) and the development of anti-alirocumab antibodies. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 8 in the 
modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, using all calculated LDL-C values during the OLDFI efficacy 
treatment period (on-treatment estimand). It was defined as: 100x (calculated LDL-C value at Week 8 
minus calculated LDL-C value at baseline)/calculated LDL-C value at baseline. 
Additionally, for Cohort 4 only, the percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week 12 was 
analyzed. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The absolute change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 8 (on-treatment estimand); 
The percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 only for Cohort 4 (on-treatment estimand); 
The percent change in Apo B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), TG, HDL-C, Apo A-1 from baseline to Week 
8 (on-treatment estimand); 
The proportion of patients achieving a calculated LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) at Week 8 
(on-treatment estimand); 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 13/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients achieving a calculated LDL-C level <110 mg/dL (2.84 mmol/L) at Week 8 
(on-treatment estimand); 
The absolute change in Apo B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), TG, HDL-C, Apo A-1 and Apo B/Apo A-1 
ratio from baseline to Week 8 (on-treatment estimand). 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy analysis population for OLDFI period and for the OLDFI/OLE combined period was 
the mITT population, consisting of all included patients who received at least one dose or partial dose of 
IMP injection and had an evaluable primary endpoint during the OLDFI efficacy treatment period. The 
primary endpoint was considered as evaluable when both following conditions are met: 
•  Availability of baseline calculated LDL-C value. 
•  Availability of at least one calculated LDL-C value during the OLDFI efficacy treatment period and 
within one of the analysis windows up to Week 8 analysis window. 
The OLDFI efficacy treatment period was defined as the period from the first IMP injection to last OLDFI 
IMP injection + 21 days (for Cohorts 1 and 2) or +35 days (for Cohorts 3 and 4). For patients entering in 
the OLE, the OLDFI efficacy treatment period was truncated at the day before the first OLE IMP injection 
in the extension period. 
Randomisation 
Patients in the mITT population were analyzed according to the alirocumab dose group allocated by 
Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS) 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this study was an open-label design. 
Statistical methods 
The percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week 8 was analyzed in the mITT population 
using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach to handle missing data. All 
post-baseline data available during the OLDFI efficacy treatment period (Week 4 and Week 8) and within 
analysis windows were used and the missing data were not imputed. The model included the fixed 
categorical effects of alirocumab doses/dose regimen, time point (Week 4, Week 8), dose-by-time point 
interaction. 
This model provided least-squares means estimates at Week 8 for each alirocumab dose, with their 
corresponding standard errors (SEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, least square (LS) 
mean with 95% CIs was provided for each cohort using appropriate contrasts. 
Additionally, for Cohort 4 only, the percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week 12 was 
analyzed using the same model. The analyses are presented without adjustment to the baseline. 
Continuous secondary efficacy variables anticipated to have a normal distribution (ie, lipids other than TG 
and Lp[a]) were analyzed in the mITT population using the same MMRM model as for the primary 
endpoint with fixed categorical effects of alirocumab doses/dose regimen, planned post-baseline time 
point up to Week 8, dose-by-time point interaction. The analyses are presented without adjustment to the 
baseline. 
Continuous secondary efficacy variables anticipated to have a non-normal distribution (ie, TG and Lp[a]) 
were analyzed in the mITT population using multiple imputation approach for handling of missing values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 14/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The percent change from baseline at time point of interest was derived from observed and imputed lipid 
values at this time point. Multiple imputation was followed by robust regression model. 
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using multiple imputation approach for handling of 
missing values as described for non-normally distributed endpoints but without logtransformation. 
For the OLDFI treatment period, central laboratory values, percent change from baseline, and/or when 
appropriate absolute change from baseline, for calculated LDL-C, Total-C, HDL-C, fasting TG, and 
non-HDL-C at each time point (including Week 10 and Week 12 time points for Cohort 4), for Lp(a), 
Apo-B, Apo-A1 and ratio Apo-B/Apo-A1 (absolute change from baseline) at Week 8 time points were 
summarized in the mITT population using: 
• 
• 
For lipids other than TG and Lp(a): LS mean and SE for each alirocumab dose group, obtained from 
the same MMRM models as used for endpoints above and including planned time points and with raw 
values, changes from baseline, or percent change from baseline as response variable in the model as 
appropriate. 
For TG and Lp(a): mean and SE for each alirocumab dose group obtained from multiple imputation 
approach followed by the robust regression models as used for endpoints above and including 
planned time points and with raw values or percent changes from baseline as response variable in the 
model as appropriate. 
In addition, quantitative descriptive summaries by time point (value at visit and % change from baseline) 
were presented for all lipids using observed (ie, non-missing) data. The time profile in % change from 
baseline of each parameter (except ratio ApoB/Apo A-1 where absolute change was used) was plotted 
according to alirocumab dose received by using LS mean and SE except for TGs and Lp(a). For these 2 
parameters, the combined estimate for mean and SE was used. 
For OLDFI /OLE combined period, only quantitative descriptive summaries by time point during the 
OLDFI/OLE combined efficacy treatment period was presented for all lipids using observed data in the 
mITT population. Lipid results pre- versus post-switch to the selected Phase 3 Q2W doses were analyzed 
separately for Cohorts 1 to 3. 
The PK analysis in the OLDFI period was performed on all included and treated patients (safety 
population) with at least one evaluable PK sample post first OLDFI IMP injection and up to the end of 
OLDFI period or first OLE IMP injection for patients proceeding into OLE period. 
The anti-alirocumab antibody (ADA) analyses in the OLDFI period and in the OLDFI/OLE combined period 
were performed on all included and treated patients (safety population) with a blood sample on Week 0 
(baseline) and at least one evaluable blood sample for antibodies post first IMP injection and up to the end 
of OLDFI period for patients not entering into OLE period, for up to end of OLE for patients proceeding into 
OLE period. 
Serum samples were collected for total alirocumab concentration pre-dose (inclusion visit) and then at 
several visits until the end of the follow-up period (for Cohorts 1-3) / end of OLDFI period (Cohort 4). 
Total alirocumab concentrations (ie, free alirocumab and alirocumab present in PCSK9: alirocumab 
complexes) were assayed with a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total and free 
PCSK9 levels were measured using validated ELISA.  
Serum samples for ADA determination were drawn periodically throughout the study. ADA samples were 
analyzed using a validated, non-quantitative, titer-based bridging immunoassay.Samples that were 
positive in the ADA assay were assessed for neutralizing anti-alirocumab antibodies using a validated, 
non-quantitative, competitive ligand binding assay.

Concentrations of total alirocumab in serum (Ctrough and Cfollow-up) were summarized on the PK 
population using descriptive statistics. 
6.1.  Discussion on study design 
A phase 2, open-label dose finding study in HefH paediatric patients (8 to 17 years of age) to evaluate 
appropriate doses to be selected for the phase 3 studies including a study in HoFH patients and a study in 
HeFH patients has been conducted and submitted in accordance with PIP requirements as outlined in 
post-approval commitments. Repeated doses of subcutaneous alirocumab were administered in 2 cohorts 
every 2 (Q2W) and 2 cohorts every 4 weeks (Q4W) in children and adolescents (aged 8-17 years) with 
heFH having LDL-C ≥ 3.37 mmol/L despite optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ± other LMTs, or a 
stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins, for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening 
period. HeFH was diagnosed based on genetic testing or in accordance with the clinical Broome criteria 
which is acceptable. HoFH patients were not to be included. Other exclusion criteria can also be 
considered reasonable.  
The screening period (4-6 weeks) can be considered sufficient to establish stable background conditions. 
A main treatment period of 8 weeks (or 12 weeks for cohort 4) to evaluate the LDL-C effect as primary 
endpoint can be considered limited but may be acceptable for a dose finding study and is in agreement 
with the PIP. There was an optional open label extension phase (36 to 40 weeks) or patients were able to 
enter the phase 3 study and were treated with the doses selected from this study. This is an acceptable 
approach. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of other parameters of the lipid profile, proportion of 
patients achieving LDL-C targets appear valuable to be evaluated for dose finding and are therefore 
acceptable. Specific attention has been given to PK/exposure related evaluation, which is important as 
supportive information and possibility for extrapolation and modelling to further support the to be applied 
doses in phase 3. 
Patients were dosed according to body weight which is acceptable considering that body weight is a 
significant covariate on the exposure of alirocumab in adults (see also pharmacology section). Doses of 
30 and 40 mg Q2W were tested for < 50 kg and 50 and 75 mg for > 50 kg, and 75 and 150 mg Q4W for 
< 50 kg and 150 and 300 mg Q4W for > 50 kg body weight. 
Sample size was limited and no formal power calculation was performed.  A mixed effect model to handle 
for missing data is supported especially to efficiently use the available data, provided missing data are not 
at random and limited (which appears to be the case, see efficacy result section 7), and therefore 
acceptable. 
7.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Blood sampling 
•  Alirocumab concentration and PCSK9 concentrations 
The PK analysis in the OLDFI period was performed on all included and treated patients (safety 
population) with at least one evaluable PK sample post first OLDFI IMP injection and up to the end of 
OLDFI period or first OLE IMP injection for patients proceeding into OLE period. 
Serum samples were collected for total alirocumab concentration pre-dose (inclusion visit) and then at 
several visits until the end of the follow-up period (for Cohorts 1-3) / end of OLDFI period (Cohort 4). 
Total alirocumab concentrations (ie, free alirocumab and alirocumab present in PCSK9: alirocumab

complexes) were assayed with the validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
REGN727-AV-11051.  
Total and free PCSK9 levels were measured using validated ELISA (REGN727-AV-11081 and 
REGN727-AV-11084, respectively).  
•  Sampling for antidrug-antibodies (ADA) 
Serum samples for ADA determination were drawn periodically throughout the study. ADA samples were 
analyzed using a validated, non-quantitative, titer-based bridging immunoassay. Samples that were 
positive in the ADA assay were assessed for neutralizing anti-alirocumab antibodies using a validated, 
non-quantitative, competitive ligand binding assay. The anti-alirocumab antibody (ADA) analyses in the 
OLDFI period and in the OLDFI/OLE combined period were performed on all included and treated patients 
(safety population) with a blood sample on Week 0 (baseline) and at least one evaluable blood sample for 
antibodies post first IMP injection and up to the end of OLDFI period for patients not entering into OLE 
period, for up to end of OLE for patients proceeding into OLE period. 
•  Analytical and statistical methods 
Concentrations of total alirocumab in serum (Ctrough and Cfollow-up) were summarized on the PK 
population using descriptive statistics. The analytical and statistical methods used in Study DFI14223 
were identical to the methods used in the initial marketing authorisation of Praluent, and therefore not 
further discussed. 
7.2.  Results 
Pharmacokinetics alirocumab 
Mean concentrations of total alirocumab increased with dose for both Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens. 
The highest mean alirocumab Ctrough were observed in Cohort 4, at 150 mg Q4W in children with BW <50 
kg and 300 mg Q4W in children with BW ≥50 kg.

Effect on PCSK9 concentrations 
Time profile for total PCSK9 concentrations and free PCSK9 in each dose group is shown in the figures 
below. The administration of alirocumab resulted in a decrease in free PCSK9 concentration from Week 4. 
The most pronounced decrease being observed in Cohort 4, at 150 mg Q4W in patients with BW <50 kg 
and 300 mg Q4W in patients with BW ≥50 kg, with level below or close to the limit of quantification. Free 
PCSK9 concentrations returned approximately to baseline levels at the end of the post-treatment 
follow-up period for Cohorts 1 to 3.

ADA status 
One patient, in Cohort 4, had a positive ADA status at baseline, before the first IMP administration. Four 
patients out of total 42 patients developed treatment-emergent positive ADA response at least once 
during the study (OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the switch): 1 patient in Cohort 1, 1 in Cohort 2, and 
2 in Cohort 3. Among these 4 treatment-emergent ADA responses, none were classified as persistent. 
Two were classified as transient responses (1 each in Cohort 1 and Cohort 3), and 2 were classified as 
indeterminate responses (1 each in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3). The median time to the onset of 
treatment-emergent ADA response ranged from 8 to 16 weeks. All ADA titers measured in these 4 
positive patients were low and did not appear to impact PK. The 4 patients developed neutralizing ADA at 
one occasion. Only 1 patient in Cohort 1 reported 2 neutralizing ADA post baseline.  
7.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In adults, body weight was identified as the most significant covariate in the final population PK model 
impacting alirocumab pharmacokinetics. Therefore dose selection based on bodyweight is supported.  
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020

The mean Ctrough levels observed in the pediatric population receiving alirocumab Q2W dose (cohort 1 and 
2), are close to the ones observed in adults receiving alirocumab Q2W dose (4142 to 5053 ng/mL (<50 
kg) and 2390 to 5544 ng/mL (≥ 50 kg) in this study versus 3950 to 6990 ng/mL in adults receiving the 
dose of 75 mg Q2W from MONO, FHI and COMBO studies; see EPAR Praluent).The mean Ctrough levels 
following the alirocumab Q4W dose (cohort 3), are close to the concentrations observed in adults 
receiving alirocumab 150 Q4W dose (2515 ng/mL (<50 kg) and 3690 ng/mL (≥ 50 kg) in this study 
versus mean Ctrough at week 12 of 3586 - 4663 ng/mL in the alirocumab 150 Q4W/Up 150 Q2W in Choice 
II study). However, the mean trough concentrations in cohort 4 were higher than observed in adults 
receiving the dose of 300 mg Q4W (5544 ng/mL (<50 kg (150 mg Q4W)) and 17880 ng/mL (≥ 50 kg (300 
mg Q4W)) versus mean Ctrough at week 12 of 8620ng/ml, in the Choice I study; see variation report 
EMEA/H/C/003882/II/0009/G). The pharmacokinetic data in cohort 1,2, and 3 were in line with adult data 
and a higher exposure was observed in cohort 4. However, there appear no clear baseline differences (see 
table baseline characteristics) that could clearly explain for a higher exposure. As the number of subjects 
per cohort is low the apparent difference may potentially be attributed to between-subject variability. 
Therefore, no final conclusions can be made on the pharmacokinetics in children based on this study 
alone. As the company will further investigate the use of alirocumab in the paediatric population in 2 
additional paediatric phase 3 clinical studies in children older than 8 years with FH and although according 
to the PIP the pharmacokinetics will be assessed in these studies as well, the substantial higher exposure 
in the highest dose and whether any amendment to these phase 3 studies would be needed should be 
further discussed (LOQ). Further, the company is expected to present a combined overview of all 
pharmacokinetic data in the paediatric population, upon completion of all paediatric studies. The 
pharmacokinetic data are too premature to consider these to be included in the SmPC.  
The administration of alirocumab resulted in a decrease in free PCSK9 concentration from Week 4.The 
most pronounced decrease being observed in children treated with the highest dose level. This is line with 
the concentration-dependent reduction in free PCSK9 which was observed in adults. ADA formation is 
discussed in the safety section.

All patients were treated with alirocumab and completed the OLDFI treatment period. All patients but one 
from Cohort 1 were included in the OLE period (patient did not want to enter the OLE period). Two 
patients enrolled in Cohort 4 were not treated in the OLE period: one patient discontinued treatment due 
to TEAE (neutropenia) reported at the end of the OLDFI period and one patient was erroneously 
registered and not treated in the OLE phase (patient did not want to enter the OLE period). 
In the OLE period, 3 patients (all in Cohort 1) did not complete the OLE study treatment period: one 
patient discontinued the treatment due to AE (fatigue) and 2 patients discontinued due to other reason 
(patient’s decisions). 
Table 2 Patient disposition - by cohort, all doses combined - Included population in OLE 
period 
Recruitment 
This was a multicenter study conducted in 16 active centers (which screened at least 1 patient) in 10 
countries worldwide (Canada, Czech Republic, France, The Netherlands, Norway, Russia, South Africa, 
Spain, Sweden and United States). Of the 16 centers which screened patients, 14 centers enrolled at least 
1 patient. 
Conduct of the study 
As done for the clinical studies conducted in adults, a conservative approach was applied to qualify the 
major protocol deviations and more particularly those that could potentially impact efficacy analyses. 
However, the review of the data does not suggest that these deviations could impact the efficacy results 
of the study. 
Using this conservative approach, major protocol deviations that could potentially impact efficacy 
analyses were reported in 13 patients overall. The most frequent deviation (reported in 8 patients) was 
related to the statin therapy. For these cases either statin therapy was temporarily stopped for a few 
days, or statin dose was changed, or patients were not receiving any statin therapy based on local 
practice (Spain) and not based on statin intolerance. Details by cohort are provided in the table below.

In the OLDFI/OLE period, alirocumab was administered as planned in the protocol, ie, the median 
injection frequency of 14 days in Cohorts 1 and 2 and 28 days in Cohorts 3 and 4. All patients (100.0%) 
had ≥80% compliance for injections during OLDFI period (ie, patients took ≥80% of their injections and 
at the scheduled times) 
Baseline data 
Overall, the median age was 12.0 years (ranged from 8 to 17 years). Six patients (14.3%) were below 10 
years. At baseline, 6 patients (2 boys and 4 girls) were prepubescent, 26 patients (16 boys and 10 girls) 
were pubescent and 10 patients (5 boys and 5 girls) were postpubescent. Overall, mean calculated LDL-C 
concentration at baseline was 175.8 mg/dL (4.6 mmol/L). At enrollment, all patients except 3 included in 
Cohort 1, were treated with at least one statin.

Table 5 Lipid efficacy parameters at baseline - Quantitative summary in conventional units - 
by cohort, all doses combined - Safety population 
At baseline, 6 patients (2 boys and 4 girls) were prepubescent, 26 patients (16 boys and 10 girls) were 
pubescent and 10 patients (5 boys and 5 girls) were postpubescent. Tanner stage at baseline was well 
balanced between the cohorts. 
Cardiovascular history and cardiovascular risk factors overall were generally similar in all 4 cohorts. 
Table 6 Summary of medical history of specific interest - CV history and CV risk factor history

At enrollment, all patients except 3 included in Cohort 1, were treated with at least one statin. Six patients 
received another LMT at enrollment (4 in Cohort 1 received ezetimibe and 2 in Cohort 3 received 
nutraceuticals [phytosterols NOS]). Among the 3 patients not receiving statin at enrollment, 2 from 
Cohort 1 were only receiving ezetimibe 10 mg/day although statin intolerance was not reported; the 
absence of use of statin was related to regional practice (Spain). The third patient in Cohort 1 initiated 
rosuvastatin.

Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
In Cohort 1 evaluating the lower Q2W doses  showed an overall LS mean [SE] percent change from 
baseline to Week 8 of -21.2% [7.9]. The response was not consistent across the doses by the BW 
category with a reduction in calculated LDLC of -41.1% (12.6) with the 30 mg Q2W dose for BW <50 kg 
and of -7.9% (10.3) with the 50 mg Q2W dose for BW ≥50 kg.  
In Cohort 2 evaluating the Q2W dosing regimen, LS mean [SE] percent change from baseline to week 8 
showed a reduction of -46.1% [8.3]; with a reduction observed in both BW categories (LS mean [SE] of 
-40.6% [13.2] with 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg, and -49.8% [10.6] with 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg). 
In Cohort 3 evaluating the Q4W dosing regimen, overall, the LS mean [SE] percent change from baseline 
to Week 8 in calculated LDL-C was moderate (-7.8% [7.6]). The response was also not consistent across 
the 2 doses by the BW category with a reduction of -17.5% (10.3) with the 75 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 
kg and an increase in calculated LDL-C of 4.0% (11.2) with the 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. 
In Cohort 4, which was implemented subsequent to the other cohorts to further evaluate the Q4W dosing 
regimen, a clinically meaningful reduction in calculated LDL-C was observed (LS mean [SE] percent 
change from baseline to Week 8 of -44.5% [7.6]). Reductions were observed in both BW categories with 
a higher effect observed with 300 mg Q4W: 31.9% [10.3] with the 150 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 kg, and 
59.8% [11.2] with the 300 mg Q4W dose for BW ≥50 kg. Consistent results to those observed at Week 
8 for the calculated LDL-C were noted at Week 12. The LS mean [SE] percent change from baseline to 
Week 12 in calculated LDL-C showed a clinically meaningful reduction of -38.6% [5.1]. Similar to what 
was observed for the primary endpoint analysis, a greater effect was observed in the higher BW group 
with the 300 mg Q4W dose: LS mean (SE) percent change from baseline to Week 12 of -29.7% (6.9) with 
the 150 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 kg and of -49.2% (7.5) with the 300 mg Q4W dose for BW ≥50 kg.

Secondary endpoints 
•  Absolute change in LDL-C 
For Cohort 2, the absolute change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 8 was substantial (LS mean 
[SE]: -75.2 [13.0] mg/dL or 1.947 [0.335] mmol/L). This clinically meaningful reduction was consistently 
observed in both BW categories with a greater decrease observed for patients with BW ≥50 kg (5.3.5.2 
Study DFI14223: LS mean (SE) of -55.5 (20.8) mg/dL or -1.439 (0.539) mmol/L with 40 mg Q2W in 
patients with BW <50 kg, and -88.3 (16.5) mg/dL or -2.286 (0.429) mmol/L with 75 mg Q2W in patients 
with BW ≥50 kg. 
In Cohort 4, the absolute change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 8 and Week 12 was (LS mean 
[SE]) -77.9 [11.7] mg/dL or -2.017 [0.304] mmol/L and (LS mean [SE]) -67.8 [8.3] mg/dL or 1.755 
[0.216] mmol/L), respectively. A greater reduction was observed in patients in the higher BW group (300 
mg Q4W). To Week 8: LS mean (SE) of -55.9 (15.9) mg/dL or -1.447 (0.411) mmol/L with 150 mg Q4W 
in patients with BW <50 kg, and -104.3 (17.4) mg/dL or -2.700 (0.451) mmol/L with 300 mg Q4W in 
patients with BW ≥50 kg. To Week 12: LS mean [SE]: -51.9 (11.3) mg/dL or -1.343 (0.293) mmol/L with 
150 mg Q4W in patients with BW <50 kg, and -86.8 (12.4) mg/dL or -2.249 (0.321) mmol/L) with 300 
mg Q4W in patients with BW ≥50 kg.

Proportion of patients achieving pre-specified LDL-C targets 
At Week 8, 88.8% of patients in Cohort 2 reached a calculated LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) and 
76.8% of patients reached a calculated LDL-C <110 mg/dL (2.84 mmol/L). 
In Cohort 4, 72.7% of patients who reached a calculated LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) at Week 8 
and 72.7% of patients who reached a calculated LDL-C <110 mg/dL (2.84 mmol/L) at Week 8. Similar 
results were observed in Cohort 4 at Week 12.

Open label extension 
In the OLE period, the effect in calculated LDL-C was maintained over time in all cohorts up to the switch 
and after the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses for patients in Cohorts 1 to 3. When considering the latest 
time point before the switch with individual results by cohort, Week 36 for Cohort 4 / Week 38 for Cohort 
3/Week 40 for Cohorts 1 and 2, there was a clinically meaningful reduction in calculated LDL-C in all 
cohorts. As observed in the OLDFI period, there was a greater reduction in Cohort 2 using the Q2W dosing 
regimen (-52.1% [13.3]) and Cohort 4 using the Q4W dosing regimen (-48.2% [6.1]) as compared with 
the 2 other cohorts (Cohort 1 Q2W dosing regimen: -23.4% [22.3], Cohort 3 Q4W dosing regimen: 
-22.9% [18.3]). 
Other lipid parameters 
In all cohorts, decreases were observed from baseline to Week 8 (on-treatment analysis) for Apo B, 
non-HDL-C and Total-C with the greatest reductions for Cohort 2 and Cohort 4: 
• 
• 
• 
For Apo B: LS mean [SE]: -38.6% [7.9] for Cohort 2 and LS mean [SE]: -38.2% [6.7] for Cohort 4. 
For non-HDL-C: LS mean [SE]: -42.2% [7.8] for Cohort 2 and LS mean [SE]: -42.0% [7.2] for Cohort 
4. 
For Total-C: LS mean [SE]: -32.0% (6.3) for Cohort 2 and LS mean [SE]: -32.1% [5.8] for Cohort 4. 
Overall, a decrease in Lp(a) was noted from baseline to Week 8 in all Cohorts with greater reductions for 
Cohorts 1 and 2. Slight increase in HDL-C and in Apo A-1 was noted without relevant differences between 
cohorts. For TG as expected, a high variability in the results was observed across the cohorts likely due to 
the very limited number of patients by cohort; therefore, no conclusion can be drawn for this parameter.

Doses to be selected for the phase 3 studies 
According to the MAH, the results identified the doses to evaluate in the pivotal phase 3 studies. The Q2W 
and Q4W dose regimens assessed in Cohorts 2 and 4 respectively were selected for further evaluation in 
the phase 3 pediatric heFH study. At these doses, because LDL-C levels remained elevated (LDL-C value 
≥110 mg/dL [2.84 mmol/L]) in some patients, an uptitration/dose-adjustment scheme was implemented 
in the phase 3 pediatric heFH study to optimize LDL-C reduction in patients with LDL-C not at target 
levels. This dosing scheme is consistent with the dosing recommendations for adults which, in clinical 
studies, demonstrated that doubling the dose of alirocumab resulted in an additional percent of patients 
reaching the target LDL-C level for adults (<70 mg/dL or <100 mg/dL depending on the individual 
patient’s CV risk) of about 15%. 
8.3.  Discussion 
Overall 42 patients were enrolled approximately evenly distributed according to the different doses 
investigated and according to the body weight subcategories and thus appears acceptable. All patients 
completed the open-label dose finding (OLDF) period of 8 weeks and only 3 patients did not enter the 
open label phase, which is reassuring. Also during the open-label phase, the discontinuation rate was low 
with 1 patients discontinuing due to fatigue and 2 due to patients decision. Several protocol deviations 
occurred during the study, but it may be questioned whether this has substantially impacted efficacy 
findings relevant for conclusions to be taken forward to phase 3 studies. 
The study population can be considered representative for a paediatric HeFH population. HeFH diagnosis 
was sufficiently established as the diagnosis was for a large part of the population by genetic testing 
(90.5%) and based on the clinical Broome criteria (89.3%). Moreover, the elevated mean LDL-C baseline 
value of 4.6 mmol/L reasonably corresponds to an LDL-C level generally observed within a HeFH 
population. Except for 3 patients (one reported to be statin intolerant), statins were not used. The age 
range was generally well represented for each cohort (8-17 years of age). Body weight categories were 
equally represented, as well as females and males. 
After 8 weeks of treatment, the higher Q2W dose (cohort 2: 40 mg Q2W for < 50 kg and 75 mg for > 50 
kg) showed greater reductions in LDL-C (-46.1%) as compared to the lower Q2W dose (30 and 50 mg, 
respectively, -21.1%). Slight differences appear in the effect according to body weight (-40.6  [sd13.2] 
with 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg, and -49.8% [sd10.6] with 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg). 
For the monthly dosing, only a moderate effect was observed for the lower dosing (cohort 3: 75 mg and 
150 mg QW4), with respectively -17.5% (10.3) and 4.0% (11.2) after 8 weeks. Based on these results, 
subsequent dosing with higher doses (cohort 4) showed greater efficacy (-31.9% [10.3] with 150 mg 
Q4W for BW <50 kg, and -59.8% [11.2] with 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg). Both in cohort 2 and 4 the BW 
≥50 kg showed the greatest efficacy. 
Effects of other parameters of the lipid profile were consistent with the effects on LDL-C, except for HDL-C 
and TG, which can be expected based on experience with adult data. 
Other endpoints supported the primary endpoint across the efficacy effects for the different cohorts 
including absolute change in LDL-C (-1.296, -1.947, -0.456 and -2.017 mmol/L, respectively cohort 1 to 
4), proportion of patients achieving pre-specified LDL-C targets (3.37 mmol/L target: 60%, 89%, 27%, 
72%; 2.84 mmol/L target: 0%, 77%, 18%, 72%), LDL-C reduction and end of the open-label extension 
phase (-23%, -52%, -23% and –48%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 33/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, a more pronounced effect can be observed in the higher Q2W dose in cohort 2 and in the higher 
QW4 dosing in cohort 4 in comparison to the respective lower dose groups. Although some variation 
exists between the body weight categories, with greater efficacy in the ≥50 kg groups. Exposure data are 
in agreement with these LDL-C efficacy observations and may thus likely explain the observed 
differences, although no exposure response data have been presented. As mentioned in the 
pharmacology section, for the higher QW4 dose, great difference in exposure according to body weight 
exists with exposures exceeding adult exposures for ≥50 kg group. From an efficacy view point, it is 
reasonable to consider the doses used in cohort 2 and cohort 4 to be taken forward to the phase 3 studies, 
as has already been done, as these studies have already been initiated. Further PK data are expected 
from the HeFH phase 3 study as this is included in the protocol as a secondary endpoint (see also 
pharmacology section). 
9.  Clinical Safety aspects 
9.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Introduction 
Safety results are presented based on the completed phase 2, dose-finding study DFI14223 in pediatric 
patients with heFH. 
In addition, a general literature search was conducted with for the period of 25 July 2018 through to 24 
July 2019, the reporting period of the latest Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) for 
alirocumab. Seven publications have been identified from the scientific (including nonclinical) and medical 
literature that included relevant safety findings. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
As the current submission is especially focussed on paediatric data, no specific attention will be given to 
the literature search. 
Safety Population 
Safety analyses were descriptive and presented by treatment group. They were performed in the safety 
population. The safety population considered for safety analyses in the OLDFI period and in OLDFI/OLE 
combined period comprised patients who actually received at least one dose or part of a dose of the IMP 
injection. Patients were analyzed according to the dose of alirocumab actually received (ie, as-treated 
alirocumab dose group). 
Immunogenicity Population 
The anti-drug antibody (ADA) analyses in the OLDFI period and in the OLDFI/OLE combined period were 
performed on all included and treated patients (safety population) with a blood sample at Week 0 
(baseline) and at least one evaluable blood sample for antibodies post first IMP injection and up to the end 
of OLDFI period for patients not entering into OLE period, or up to end of OLE for patients proceeding into 
OLE period. 
9.2.  Results 
Exposure 
In the OLDFI period, the median duration of treatment exposure was 8 weeks in Cohorts 1 to 3 and 12 
weeks in Cohort 4. In the combined OLDFI/OLE period up to the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 34/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
median duration of treatment exposure was 70.3 weeks in Cohort 1, 54.3 weeks in Cohort 2, 50.6 weeks 
in Cohort 3 and 24.0 weeks in Cohort 4. 
The difference in the duration of exposure is due to the sequential enrollment of Cohorts 1 to 4 and the 
common study end date that was applied when Cohort 4 was completed. 
Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
Overall, 21 patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in the OLDFI 
period: 9 in Cohort 1, 2 in Cohort 2, 4 in Cohort 3 and 6 in Cohort 4. After the dose switch, 2 additional 
patients from Cohort 3 experienced at least one TEAE. 
In the combined OLDFI/OLE periods up to the switch to the selected Phase 3 Q2W doses, a total of 29 
patients experienced at least one TEAE: 9 patients in Cohort 1, 5 in Cohort 2 (3 additional patients 
compared to the OLDFI alone), 8 in Cohort 3 (4 additional patients) and 7 in Cohort 4 (1 additional 
patient). Overall, no effect of the dose or the dose-regimen was observed for any TEAEs. 
Two patients experienced a TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation: one patient in Cohort 
4 experienced a neutropenia reported at the end of the OLDFI period and another patient from Cohort 1 
experienced fatigue during the OLE period after the switch to the selected Phase 3 Q2W doses.  
No treatment-emergent SAEs were reported throughout the whole duration of the study, ie, in the OLDFI 
period, the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses, or after the dose 
switch. 
One patient reported a post-treatment serious AE (Type 1 diabetes) in Cohort 4.

Table 16 Overview of adverse event profile: Treatment emergent adverse events - OLDFI/OLE 
combined period, up to the switch to Phase 3 doses- by cohort, all doses combined - Safety 
population - Study DFI14223 
The most commonly reported TEAEs were in the System Organ Class (SOC) Infections and infestations 
(11 patients in the OLDFI period and 5 additional patients in the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020

switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses) and in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (7 patients in the OLDFI 
period and 2 additional patients in the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the switch). 
Overall, the most frequently reported events by Preferred Term during the OLDFI/OLE combined period 
were nasopharyngitis (5 patients), upper respiratory tract infection (4 patients) and diarrhea (5 patients). 
Treatment related adverse events 
Few TEAEs were considered related to IMP by the Investigators. In the OLDFI period, 1 patient in Cohort 
4 experienced 2 local injection site reactions, and 1 patient in Cohort 2 experienced blood 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) decrease and blood luteinizing hormone (LH) decrease. 
For the latter patient, the laboratory results were from a blood sample taken just before the first dose 
administration of alirocumab. However, the associated AEs were reported after the dose administration 
and therefore captured as treatment-emergent. In the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the dose switch, 
the patient mentioned above for blood FSH decreased/blood LH decreased experienced LDL-C decreased 
(one LDL-C value <50 mg/dL). Finally, another local injection site reaction was reported by 1 patient 
enrolled in Cohort 3 in the OLE period up to the switch. 
Adverse events of special interest 
No neurological events (requiring additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a specialist), 
neurocognitive events, increase in ALT, general allergic events or local injection site reactions (requiring 
consultation with another physician) meeting the protocol definition of AESI were reported during the 
study. 
•  Neurological adverse events 
No neurological events (requiring additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a specialist), or 
neurocognitive events were reported. 
• 
Injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions (3 events) were reported in 2 patients (1 patient in Cohort 3 and 1 patient in 
Cohort 4) and were both mild in intensity.  
•  Hepatic disorders 
One patient in Cohort 1 experienced CMV hepatitis after switching to Phase 3 Q2W doses (from 50 mg 
Q2W to 75 mg Q2W). The event occurred 5 days after the last IMP administration, was of mild intensity 
and resolved within 39 days. It was not associated with ALT >3 ULN. This patient also experienced fatigue 
which led to treatment discontinuation. 
•  Diabetes or diabetic complications 
Two patients developed diabetes mellitus: 
o  A 17-year old female patient in Cohort 1 was reported to have a treatment-emergent Type 1 
diabetes mellitus in the OLE period before the switch to Phase 3 Q2W doses. According to medical 
history information, this patient had experienced intermittently increased glycaemia for 4 years. 
An increased fasting glucose value of 7.9 mmol/L (potential clinically significant abnormality 
(PCSA) value) was only observed after switching to the Phase 3 Q2W doses, at Week 76. The 
patient was asymptomatic. No changes in weight were observed for this patient during her study 
participation. The patient was found to be positive for anti-GAD antibodies; however negative for 
antityrosine phosphatase IA2 and anti-insulin antibodies. The patient did not have any other 
autoimmune disease. HbA1c value at the time of diagnosis was reported to be increased; 
Assessment report  
EMA/330215/2020 
Page 36/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
however, the value was not provided. Subsequent available HbA1c values were within the 
normal range. The event was considered nonserious and not related to study drug by the 
Investigator. The endocrinologist considered that the mildly increased values of glycemia did not 
require treatment with insulin. The patient was initiated on metformin. 
o  An 11-year old male patient in Cohort 4, on levothyroxine treatment for autoimmune thyroiditis 
was reported to have a post-treatment serious AE (Type 1 diabetes mellitus). During the study 
participation, the glucose values were normal. The event was reported approximately 3.5 
months after the last dose of study drug (glycaemia: 16 mmol/L, HbA1C: 89 mmol/mol (10.3%) 
and glycosuria 4+). Positive anti-GAD antibodies and highly positive anti-TPO antibodies were 
reported. Ophthalmological examination was normal. The patient did not experience fluctuations 
in body weight. The event was assessed as medically significant and led to one week 
hospitalization. The patient was initiated on human insulin and detemir insulin as corrective 
treatment. The Investigator considered the event not related to study drug. 
•  Cataract 
No cataracts were reported in the study. 
Adverse events from patients with 2 consecutive calculated LDL-C <50 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L) 
or <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) 
No patients had 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dL. 
One patient had 2 consecutive LDL-C value <50 mg/dL in Cohort 2 in the OLE period before the switch to 
Phase 3 Q2W doses. No TEAEs were reported in this patient after the first of the 2 consecutive LDL-C <50 
mg/dL (<1.30 mmol/L) and up to the end of the TEAE period. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
No treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in the OLDFI/OLE combined period. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the OLDFI/OLE combined period. 
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
Two patients experienced TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. None of the events 
were assessed to be related to alirocumab by the Investigators. 
•  One patient enrolled in Cohort 4 (150 mg Q4W), with mild neutropenia at screening of 1.21 G/L 
(normal range: 1.65 - 8.15) and 1.16 G/L at Week 8, had an absolute neutrophil count value below 
1 G/L (0.78 G/L) at Week 12 following the injection done at Week 8. Although the IMP was 
discontinued due to this TEAE, the patient entered in the OLE period without taking the IMP. During 
the OLE period, the patient experienced fluctuating values of neutrophils; which returned to normal 
(1.73 G/L) 3 months after treatment discontinuation. Neutrophils were again below the lower limit 
of normal range (LLN) (0.98 G/L) 1 month later while the patient was off-treatment. 
•  During the OLE period after the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses, 1 patient from Cohort 1 
experienced fatigue that was associated with the diagnosis of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) hepatitis. 
Corrective treatment with vitamin B complex and ubidecarenone was initiated. Treatment with 
alirocumab was discontinued 7 months after the start of the event and the patient recovered around 
1 month later.

Laboratory parameters 
Blood cell counts 
Overall, there were no relevant changes over time for red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
leukocytes, leukocyte differential counts and platelets during the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the 
switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses in any of the cohorts or after the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses. 
However, two patients (both in the BW <50 kg category) had abnormal low neutrophils that were 
reported as non-serious TEAE by the Investigator (neutropenia of mild intensity). One patient, with mild 
neutropenia at screening of 1.21 G/L (normal range: 1.65 - 8.15) and 1.16 G/L at Week 8, had neutrophil 
count of 0.78 G/L at Week 12 at the dose of 150 mg Q4W and another had neutrophil count of 1.44 G/L 
at Week 26 at the dose of 75 mg Q4W. In the former case, the TEAE led to treatment discontinuation. 
Both events resolved. 
Electrolytes 
There were no clinically relevant abnormalities in electrolytes observed during the study. 
Metabolic function 
In the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses, 2 patients had PCSA value 
for fasting glucose and the values returned to normal in the following visits. After the switch to Phase 3 
Q2W doses, 1 patient had a PCSA for fasting glucose at Week 76, (7.9 mmol/L), which returned to normal 
value at Week 100 (5.2 mmol/L). At the end of OLE, fasting glucose was 6.0 mmol/L. This patient was 
reported with TEAE of type 1 diabetes. One patient had increase in creatine phosphokinase >3 ULN at the 
end of the OLE period, but the value returned within normal levels 15 days later. No patients had PCSAs 
for albumin or out-of-normal range value for protein. No laboratory test abnormalities in metabolic 
parameters were reported as TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation or met a seriousness criterion. 
Renal parameters 
During the OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the switch to Phase 3 Q2W doses, PCSAs for renal function 
were reported in 8 patients: 6 patients had high PCSA value for urea nitrogen (1 in Cohorts 1 and 2 and 
4 in Cohort 3), 1 patient had low PCSA value for eGFR in Cohort 1 and 1 patient had high PCSA value for 
uric acid in Cohort 4. Most patients had PCSA only once and the value returned to normal levels at the 
following visit. After the switch to Phase 3 Q2W doses, 2 patients had one PCSA value for uric acid. No 
abnormal values in any of the renal function parameters were reported as TEAEs during the study. 
Liver parameters 
The incidence of PCSA in liver function parameters was very low during the combined OLDFI/OLE period 
up to the switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses (1 patient with abnormally high total bilirubin), as well as 
during the period after the switch (1 patient with abnormally high alkaline phosphatase). For both 
patients, abnormal values returned to normal levels at following visits. 
There were no clinically relevant abnormalities in liver function parameters observed during the study.

Cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) 
Three patients, all in Cohort 3, had abnormal low cortisol value during the OLDFI/OLE combined up to the 
switch to the Phase 3 Q2W doses and 7 patients when considering the OLDFI/OLE combined period after 
the switch (Cohorts 1 to 3). For 2 of the 3 patients with abnormally low cortisol, the levels returned to 
normal values at the subsequent visits and up to the end of the study. The last patient had normal cortisol 
values at the subsequent 2 visits and then abnormal value at the end of the OLE period. None had 
abnormal reflexive adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) value at the stimulation test. They were no 
clinically relevant abnormalities in cortisol observed during the study. 
Gonadal and pituitary hormones assessments 
There were no clinically relevant abnormalities in gonadal and pituitary hormones in boys observed during 
the study. One female patient (16-year-old, pubescent at baseline and at the end of the study) had low 
LH and FSH on the day of randomization reported as TEAEs. The values returned normal range at the end 
of the study. No other clinically relevant abnormalities in gonadal and pituitary hormones were observed 
during the study. 
Fat soluble vitamins 
With regard to fat soluble vitamins, vitamin D deficiency was reported as a TEAE in 3 patients in the 
OLDFI/OLE combined period. All of the 3 patients had already low vitamin D values at baseline (35, 50, 
and 54.4 nmol/L) for which they received vitamin D supplementation. The events were resolved or 
resolving at the end of the study. A decrease in vitamin E parallel to the decrease in LDL-C levels was 
observed in all cohorts from baseline to Week 8 and a positive correlation between calculated LDL-C and 
vitamin E was observed in the OLDFI period. No patient had vitamin E values lower than normal range. 
Vital signs 
For systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and weight, the mean changes from 
baseline were similar in the different cohorts, and none of the changes were clinically significant or 
reported as TEAEs. 
Anti alirocumab antibodies 
Four patients developed treatment-emergent positive ADA response during the study (OLDFI/OLE 
combined period up to the switch): 1 patient in Cohort 1, 1 in Cohort 2, and 2 in Cohort 3. Among these 
4 treatment-emergent ADA responses, none were classified as persistent. Two were classified as 
transient responses (1 each in Cohort 1 and Cohort 3), and 2 were classified as indeterminate responses 
(1 each in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3). 
Four patients had positive neutralizing ADA status post-baseline (OLDFI/OLE combined period up to the 
switch to Phase 3 Q2W doses). Of those, 3 patients had single episodes of neutralizing ADA, and 1 patient 
in Cohort 1 had 2 episodes of neutralizing ADA post-baseline. 
Among the 4 treatment-emergent ADA positive cases, 2 patients did not present with any adverse events. 
One patient with a medical history of asthma experienced a non-serious asthma attack 5 months after a 
transient positive ADA response. The remaining patient had an ADA positive response at several time 
points between Week 8 and Week 28 with a single titer >240 (480), with ADA negative status at 
subsequent measures. The patient had recurrent episodes of cold during the period of ADA positivity. She 
was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1; however, increased glycaemia had been already in her 
medical history several years before There were no safety concerns related to positive ADA raised in any 
of these patients.

9.3.  Discussion 
The current dose finding study included 42 patients treated for up to a mean of 70 weeks. The number of 
patients can be considered very limited to evaluate the safety profile in paediatric patients. However, the 
current study is a dose finding study, and further data are expected from the phase 3 studies, especially 
the HeFH study as this study aims to include considerably more patients. 
Adverse events were reported from 36% to 90% across the different cohorts during the dose finding 
phase, and 50% to 90% during the open label extension phase. Most adverse events were reported in the 
SOC Infections and infestations (11 patients in the OLDFI period and 5 additional patients in the 
OLDFI/OLE combined period with nasopharyngitis (5 patients), upper respiratory tract infection (4 
patients) and diarrhea (5 patients) being the most reported adverse events, which appears to be in line 
with adult findings. 
However, only 2 events were considered treatment related (local injection site reactions; blood 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) decrease and blood luteinizing hormone (LH) decrease). For the latter, 
this may even be questioned as this was from blood samples taken before study initiation, but reported 
after initiation. No dose dependent effect was observed, however, data are limited and likely do not allow 
for such an assessment. Nevertheless, any dose dependent adverse effects have not been observed for 
adults. 
Adverse events of special interest were also examined and were not reported for neurological events, 
neurocognitive events, ALT increased (hepatic disorders), general allergic event or local injection site 
reactions, or cataract. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported. However, 2 patients developed 
diabetes mellitus. The first patient was considered nonserious and not treatment related, however, 
metformin medication was initiated. The second patient developed type 1 DM which occurred 3.5 months 
after last dose and was not considered treatment related, which can be considered reasonable. 
Discontinuations due to adverse events were limited to 2 patients. These events were not considered to 
be treatment-related, which can be considered reasonable based on the detailed description of these 
events. 
Laboratory values were generally within the normal range and/or non persistent for blood cell counts, 
electrolytes, metabolic function, fasting glucose, CK levels, renal parameters, liver parameters, hormone 
levels. Decrease of vitamin E paralleled the decrease in LDL-C, a known observation also from adult data. 
However, 2 patients had low neutrophils but these were non-serious, although one patient discontinued 
treatment. Also, a patient with elevated glucose level and the end of the OLE study was reported with type 
I diabetes as discussed. 
In the paediatric study, about 10% of the subjects had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) detected and all were 
transient responses. These data are in line with adult data. In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study 5.5% of 
patients treated with alirocumab 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) had anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) detected, most of these were transient responses. Neutralising antibody (NAb) responses were 
also limited in this study and observed in 0.5% of patients treated with alirocumab, although data are 
currently limited. Therefore, based on currently limited data, frequencies appear comparable. ADA 
formation did not appear to impact clinical results. 
Overall, the database was very limited to address the safety profile in paediatric patients. Adverse events 
were generally in line with those observed for adult patients. Serious events were not reported, which is 
reassuring. It can be reasonably supported that the two events of diabetes mellitus were not considered 
treatment related, although it is expected that such events of special interest will also be monitored 
during the phase 3 studies as an effect on glucose and diabetes mellitus has been observed in adults. No

other relevant unexpected laboratory abnormalities were observed. Overall, the safety profile can be 
acceptable to continue treatment in the phase 3 studies.

Question 1 
A substantial higher exposure for the Q4W 300 mg dose (for patients ≥ 50 kg 8-17 years of age) is 
observed in comparison to the adult exposure of a similar dose (mean Ctrough 17880 ng/ml versus 
8620ng/ml, respectively). Any possible reasons for this higher exposure should be discussed, and 
subsequently, whether this should lead to any protocol amendment of the already initiated phase 3 
studies in HofH and HeFH paediatric patients. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder acknowledges the Rapporteur’s observation that a higher exposure of 
alirocumab was observed in children and adolescents with HeFH treated with the Q4W 300 mg dose, in 
comparison to the mean exposure observed in adults treated with the same dosing regimen (CHOICE I, 
R727-CL-1308 study). 
Body weight (BW) has been identified as a significant covariate of the exposure to alirocumab in adults 
and was the only factor used for dose selection in children and adolescents. Compared to adult data, a 
higher exposure of alirocumab was only observed with the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen in children and 
adolescents with BW ≥50 kg. At the other doses assessed in children and adolescents with BW≥ 50 kg, 
i.e., 50 mg Q2W, 75 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q4W, the mean exposure was consistent with that measured 
at the same dose in adults, which suggests comparable PK behaviors in adults and pediatric patients.

The results observed with the 300 mg Q4W dose should be interpreted with care, as few pediatric patients 
were treated with this alirocumab dose. Only 5 pediatric patients received 300 Q4W for 12 weeks in study 
DFI14223, compared to 458 adult patients who received the same dosing regimen in study CHOICE I. 
Overall, the mean (SD) BW of the 5 children enrolled in the 300 mg Q4W group was 61.2 (11.9) kg 
(range: 50 to 78 kg), much lower than the mean BW of the 458 adults who received 300 mg Q4W in the 
CHOICE I study (mean [SD]: 89.4 [19.9] kg, range: 44 to 171 kg). In order to compare Ctrough values 
in adult and pediatric populations of similar BW, we compared the mean Ctrough of the 5 children and 
adolescents who received 300 mg Q4W in study DFI14223 to the mean Ctrough of adult patients with BW 
between 50 (≥) and 80 kg (<) in the 300 mg Q4W arm of the CHOICE I study. 
In the 136 adult patients with PK value available at Week 12 and with a baseline BW between 50 (≥) and 
80 kg (<) in the 300 mg Q4W arm of the CHOICE I study, the mean (SD) Ctrough of alirocumab was 
13142.1 (9235.0) ng/mL (Table 17). In the 5 children and adolescents who received 300 mg Q4W in 
study DFI14223, the mean (SD) Ctrough was 17204.0 (9404.2) ng/mL at Week 12 (see previously 
submitted Study DFI14223 Clinical study report [CSR], Table 72), thus largely overlapping with the 
Ctrough of adults with BW between 50 (≥) and 80 kg (<) in the 300 mg Q4W arm in study CHOICE I. This 
overlap is illustrated by the box plots of all Ctrough values collected up to Week 12 at the dose of 300 mg 
Q4W, in the 5 children and adolescents in the DFI14223 study (Figure 4) and in the 136 adults with BW 
between 50 (≥) and 80 kg (<) in the CHOICE I study (Figure 5). These PK data confirm the role of BW as 
a significant covariate of the exposure to alirocumab and point out a large overlap of Ctrough values 
between adult and pediatric patients of comparable body weights. 
From an efficacy view point, the dose of 300 mg Q4W was effective in all 5 pediatric patients of study 
DFI14223, with mean (LS mean [SE]) LDL-C percent reductions from baseline to Week 8 of -59.2 (11.0) 
and from baseline to Week 12 of -46.1 (5.3). Importantly, the reduction was not associated with very low 
LDL-C values (i.e., no patient had 2 consecutive LDL-C value <50 mg/dL). In adult patients with BW 
between 50 (≥) and 80 kg (<) treated with 300 mg Q4W in the CHOICE 1 study, the mean (LS mean [SE]) 
LDL-C percent reduction from baseline to Week 12 was -64.1 (1.8) in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) 
population (Table 2). These data show that the dose of alirocumab 300 mg Q4W is needed in pediatric 
patients with BW (≥50 kg) to achieve maximal LDL-C reduction like in adults. 
From a safety viewpoint, because alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) with a high selectivity 
towards its target, PCSK9, no “off-target” effects are anticipated. Consistent with the high specificity of 
alirocumab to inhibit PCSK9, no safety-dose effect or dose exposure was observed in the phase 2/3 
clinical studies conducted in adult patients with hypercholesterolemia.  
No difference in the safety of the 75 mg or 150 mg Q2W doses was identified in studies pertaining to the 
initial submission file and subsequently with the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen. Therefore, a higher exposure 
is unlikely to impact the safety profile in the patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
reported in the 5 patients enrolled in the 300 mg Q4W group were reviewed in light of the TEAEs reported 
in the other cohorts of the DFI14223study (see previously submitted Study DFI14223 [CSR, Table 
16.2.7.1.2.2.3]) and also in light of the adult data. Review of these TEAEs did not identify any new, 
unexpected safety findings. 
Collectively, these observations show that the 300 mg Q4W dose is the correct dose for further evaluation 
in children and adolescents with BW ≥ 50 kg for both efficacy and safety. Accordingly, no amendment to 
the protocol of the ongoing phase 3 study that is using this dosage (EFC14643), is deemed necessary. 
The higher exposure of alirocumab observed in the 5 children and adolescents treated with the Q4W 300 
mg dose can be attributed to their lower BW as compared to the BW of the overall adult population in the 
CHOICE I study. Indeed, when we looked at data of adults with BW between 50 (≥) and 80 kg (<), the 
Assessment report

Page 42/46 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
exposures at the dose of 300 mg Q4W were within the distribution range of children and adolescents. 
Within the limits of the small sample, the 300 mg Q4W dose appears to be safe and well-tolerated in 
children and adolescents with BW >50 kg. 
The safety of the 300 mg Q4W dosing regimen will be further characterized in the ongoing EFC14643 
study conducted in pediatric patients with HeFH. In this study, safety data are reviewed on a quarterly 
basis by the Data Monitoring Committee, which at their most recent meeting on December 4th, 2019, 
recommended to continue the study as planned.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The company discussed the possible reasons for the high exposure of alirocumab observed in cohort 4 of 
Study DFI14223. Cohort 4  contained 5 children and adolescents with body weigght ≥ 50 kg with the Q4W 
300 mg dose.  Despite that the results observed with the 300 mg Q4W dose should be interpreted with 
care, as only 5 pediatric patients were treated with this alirocumab dose, compared to 458 adult patients 
who received the same dosing regimen in study CHOICE I, it is supported that the higher mean exposure 
of alirocumab observed in the 5 children and adolescents can likely be mainly attributed to the lower body 
weight of the children as compared to the body weight of the overall adult population in the CHOICE I 
study. For example, although the mean Ctrough alirocumab concentration was higher, the exposure 
range of the 5 pediatric patients treated with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W (Figure 4) was within the exposure 
range observed for the adult population with BW between 50 and 80mg with the same dose (Figure 5).  
Based on the comparison of the efficacy data from children in cohort 4 of study DFI14223 (in pediatric 
patients with BW (≥50 kg)) and the adult subgroup (50 to 80 kg) from CHOICE I study comparable 
efficacy of LDL-C reduction is achieved with the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W dose. Although a higher mean 
exposure is observed it can reasonably be expected that this will likely not emerge to important safety 
issues, as no exposure dependent adverse events are known with the use of alirocumab. For instance, no 
difference in safety profile is kwown between different doses previously examined. Based on this 
consideration, it is acceptable to take this dose further to be evaluated in the ongoing study EFC14643 (as 
already been done).  Further safety data will be generated in study EFC14643 to confirm the safety profile 
in this paediatric population.

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing lonafarnib was considered 
justified based on clinical observations supporting a lower mortality rate after treatment with the 
product compared to no treatment; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating in particular due to atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and strokes, with death occurring at an average age of 14.6 years; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.01 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
the sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the 
European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
For the purpose of orphan designation, it was originally considered by the COMP that the condition 
named as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome would cover both classic and atypical syndromes, 
including progeroid laminopathies. 
Hutchinson-Guildford progeria is a rare and uniformly fatal, segmental "premature aging" disease. 
Initial presentation in early childhood is primarily based on growth and dermatologic findings. Primary 
morbidity and mortality for children with HGPS is from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 
strokes with death occurring at an average age of 14.6 years. (Ulrich et al, 2015). 
With regards to the aetiology of the condition, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome is caused by 
aberrant splicing of the LMNA gene which results in a farnesylated truncated mutant lamin A protein 
called progerin (Eriksson et al, 2003). By way of background, ground, the products of LMNA gene, 
primarily lamin A and C, are key components of the nuclear lamina, and mutations of laminins has 
been associated with neuropathies, muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, and premature aging 
diseases (Gonzalo et al, 2017).

Most “classic” HGFS harbour a single-base substitution G608G(GGC > GGT), within exon 11(Eriksson 
et al, 2003, De Sandre-Giovannoli et al, 2003). “Atypical” progeria syndromes have also been reported 
in the literature and variants for atypical progeria have also been attributed to LMNA. While there is 
considerable overlap in the phenotype, variability remains in the severity, onset, and lifespan as 
compared with HGPS. Progeroid laminopathies, which are even rarer than HGPS, have clinical features 
that overlap HGPS, but are caused by mutations in the LMNA gene or in proteins affecting the post-
translational pathway of LMNA such as Zmpste24 that result in farnesylated progerin-like proteins. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Zokinvy is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 months of 
age and older with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome or a 
processing-deficient progeroid laminopathy associated with either a heterozygous LMNA mutation with 
progerin-like protein accumulation or a homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutation.” 
falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria 
Syndrome”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes in the chronically debilitating or life-threatening nature of the condition 
since the orphan designation. Neither have there been any approved therapies which have improved 
the morbidity or mortality of the condition since the original designation. 
Primary morbidity and mortality for children with HGPS (including atypical progeria syndrome like 
progeroid laminopathies) is from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and strokes with death 
occurring at an average age of 14.6 years. (Ulrich et al, Handb Clin Neurol. 2015;132:249-64). 
Children have a severe failure to thrive, with typical lipoatrophy, mandibular and cranial 
malformations, short stature, delayed dentition, thin skin with sclerodermatous areas, and baldness . 
Bone resorption is also common. Usually, these individuals do not become sexually mature. Intellectual 
development is not affected. Death is almost exclusively due to myocardial infarction, heart failure or 
stroke, due to widespread atherosclerosis. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor bases the prevalence estimate on the Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) International 
Registry database and identified the number of patients living with the diagnosis in EU member states. 
Table 1 below recapitulates the numbers identified at the time of submission which has slightly 
increased since the orphan designation.

*Each of the country (except United Kingdom) population as of January 1, 2021 was sourced from website: 
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat. For United Kingdom, it is the data released on 25 June 2021 from UK office of 
national statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/ . 
** Calculated Prevalence = combined patient number (HGPS and atypical syndrome: PL)/Country population 
*** As of 1 January 2021, EU pharmaceutical law applies to and in the UK in respect of Northern Ireland only. 
Using the highest prevalence noted as the most conservative number (i.e., 1 case per 4 million), it is 
estimated that the prevalence of the disease is 0.0025 per 10,000 persons in EU. At the time of 
designation, the number was rounded up to less than 0.01 but as the data provided by the sponsor 
seems to be quite reliable, and assuming that indeed most patients are captured in the registry, a 
figure of 0.003 could be used instead. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
No authorised products have been identified in the EU. Treatment of HGPS is directed toward the 
specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Medications used to treat HGPS include low-

dose aspirin, statins, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, but these do not prevent early death to a 
satisfactorily extent. Management may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists who may 
need to systematically and comprehensively plan an affected child’s treatment (NORD). 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

4.  COMP position adopted on 20 May 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) 
was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.003 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and strokes, with 
death generally occurring in early teenage years, and chronically debilitating with typical 
lipoatrophy, facial dysmorphia, premature aging, short stature, delayed dentition, and thin skin 
with sclerodermatous areas. 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment that has been authorised in the 
European Union for patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Lonafarnib EigerBio Europe 
Limited, lonafarnib for treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (EU/3/18/2118) is not 
removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

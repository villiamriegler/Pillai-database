2  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
The  current  treatment  of  cancer  with  combination  cytotoxic  therapy  targeting  proliferating  cells 
usually leads to bone marrow damage, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and, most importantly, neutropenia 
resulting  in  impaired  host  defence.  A  severe  neutropenia  will  inevitably  lead  to  serious  infections. 
Life-threatening gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections as well as sepsis will occur as long as the 
severe neutropenia prevails. This leads to delays in subsequent chemotherapy cycles. The recovery of 
the  bone  marrow  is  stimulated  by  various  growth factors.  The  most  important  growth  factor  for  the 
recovery of neutrophils is granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a 20,000 Dalton 
glycoprotein  hormone  that  stimulates  the  proliferation  of  neutropoietic  progenitor  cells  and  their 
differentiation to granulocytes, and functionally activates mature neutrophils. 
Human G-CSF is a single polypeptide chain protein of 174 amino acids with O-glycosylation at one 
threonine residue. It acts by binding to a specific transmembrane receptor (G-CSF receptor), a member 
of the class I cytokine receptor family expressed on various haematopoietic cells such as stem cells, 
multipotent  progenitors,  myeloid-committed  progenitors,  neutrophils,  and  monocytes.  This  receptor 
forms  homo-oligomeric  complexes  upon  ligand  binding.  Seven  membrane-bound  and  one  soluble 
isoform  of  the  G-CSF  receptor  have  been  isolated;  the  membrane-bound  isoforms  arise  from 
alternative  RNA  splicing  leading  to  differences  in  the  cytoplasmic  sequences,  but  the  extracellular, 
ligand-binding domains are identical. Consequently, the effects of G-CSF (and of recombinant human 
G-CSF, rhG-CSF) are mediated via a single affinity class of receptors. The same mechanism of action 
and  receptor  mediated  biological  activity  operates  in  mobilization  of  mature  neutrophils  into  the 
circulating neutrophil pool and acceleration of granulopoiesis. 
Zarzio is a recombinant human G-CSF produced in E. coli. Its amino acid sequence is identical to that 
of  natural  human  G-CSF,  except  for  the  addition  of  an  N-terminal  methionine  necessary  for  the 
expression in E. coli. Moreover, it is not glycosylated. 
A marketing authorisation application has been submitted by Sandoz GmbH (Austria) for the product 
Zarzio (filgrastim) under 2001/83/EC Article 10(4) Biosimilar medicinal product. 
The indications claimed are exactly the same as those of the reference product Neupogen. 
(cid:131)  Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  patients 
treated  with  established  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic 
myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and reduction in the duration of neutropenia 
in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered 
to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are 
similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(cid:131)  Mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells. 
(cid:131)  In  patients  (children  or  adults)  with  severe  congenital,  cyclic,  or  idiopathic  neutropenia  with  an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, 
long term administration is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and 
duration of infection-related events. 
(cid:131)  Treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109/L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, 
in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other therapeutic options are inappropriate. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Two  presentations  of  the  medicinal  product  are  provided,  30MU  (300  µg/0.5  ml),  Solution  for 
Injection/concentration  for  solution  for  infusion  –  pre-filled  syringe  and  48  MU  (480  µg/0.5  ml), 
Page 5 of 33 
 
 
 
 
Solution for Injection/concentrate for solution for infusion – pre-filled syringe. The reference product 
is Neupogen (Amgen GmbH, Germany) also available in the same two presentations, which was used 
for the entire comparability exercise to demonstrate comparable quality, safety and efficacy.  
Active Substance 
Manufacture 
Filgrastim is manufactured and released at Sandoz GmbH, Kundl, Austria. Filgrastim is produced by 
recombinant  DNA  technology  in  bacteria  (E.coli)  from  the  full  length  human  sequence  for  N-(L-
Methionyl) granulocytes colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF). Native G-CSF is a glycosylated 
protein  but  production  in  bacteria  leads  to  a  non-glycosylated  product,  however,  this  is  still 
biologically active. Appropriate data have been provided to demonstrate genetic stability of the host 
cell  construct.  E.coli  are  expanded  in  fermentors  using  human  and  animal-free  growth  media. 
Filgrastim  is  concentrated  in  E.coli  inclusion  bodies  (IB)  which  are  isolated  by  cell  disruption  and 
centrifugation  and  then  solubilised  to  allow  protein  re-folding.  Down-stream  processing  involves 
chromatographic  purification  steps  to  separate  filgrastim  from  other  contaminating  proteins  and 
impurities. This is followed by further polishing steps. A final buffer exchange is performed to yield 
the active substance solution. 
The E.coli are banked in a standard 2 tier banking system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and 
a manufacturers working cell bank (MWCB) to current guidelines. All materials used to manufacture 
filgrastim are controlled and of a suitable quality. Critical steps and intermediates are controlled by a 
range of critical process parameters (identified during development), process parameters, action limits 
and  acceptance  criteria.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  critical  steps,  a  validation  programme  was 
devised and implemented. Process validation was performed at full scale and the results used to justify 
the  limits  set.  Within  process  validation,  hold  times  for  intermediates  were  also  validated  as  was 
chromatography column re-use. Final active substance filling and shipping was validated. 
During  manufacturing  development  of  active  substance,  key  steps  were  investigated  and  optimised. 
Development  of  the  purification  stages  included  different  chromatographic  methods  ,  buffer 
compositions, and the sequence of steps. 
Filgrastim is stored in pre-sterilised non-pyrogenic bottles with screw caps.  
Characterisation 
Extensive characterisation was undertaken of filgrastim as well as medicinal product and additionally 
Neupogen medicinal product to confirm identity and purity. Primary structure, secondary and tertiary 
structures were assessed using appropriate analytical techniques. Charge characteristics were assessed 
by  isoelectric  focussing  (IEF),  as  well  as  cation  and  anion  chromatography.  Finally,  biological 
characteristics  were  assessed  by  bioassay,  western  blotting  and  surface  plasmon  resonance 
spectroscopy (to investigate binding affinity). The characterisation programme was based on scientific 
advice  received  by  the  Applicant  from  the  CHMP.  Characterisation  data  supported  the  correct 
sequence  and  folding  of  the  recombinant  G-CSF  and  demonstrated  good  batch  reproducibility.  A 
series of in-house standards were prepared and used throughout characterisation and for batch release. 
The WHO standard for G-CSF was also used within the bioassay. 
Product  related impurities were  identified,  also  using  stressed  samples and  characterised  by  suitable 
methods in all active substance and DP batches. Appropriate limits were set, based on batch data. 
Potential  process  related  impurities  were  considered  and  identified.  Appropriate  analytical  methods 
were  selected,  and  all  batches  tested  and  limits  set  based  on  batch  data  and  pharmacopoeial 
specifications.

•  Specification 
Active substance specifications and shelf-life specifications have been set, supported and justified with 
batch data and characterisation data. All non-pharmacopoeial methods were suitably validated. 
•  Stability 
Active substance stability has been determined to be 36 months at -20±5°C. 
•  Comparability Exercise for Active Substance  
Medicinal Product composition of Zarzio and Neupogen are quantitatively identical except the buffer 
system for Zarzio is glutamate and for Neupogen it is acetate. 
The  data  presented  confirm  Zarzio  and  Neupogen  conform  with  respect  to  primary  structure, 
secondary and tertiary structure, molecular mass, hydrophobicity, molecular size, charge, binding and 
(in-vitro) bioactivity. 
Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The medicinal product composition was developed to be suitable both for subcutaneous injection and 
for intravenous infusion; furthermore, as a biosimilar medicinal product, it was developed to be similar 
to  the  reference  product  resulting  in  two  formulations  30  MU/0.5  ml  and  48  MU/0.5  ml.  During 
development a number of buffer systems were tested for stability of the active substance, concluding 
that: glutamate = acetate. The final composition was optimised and matched to Neupogen except for 
the use of glutamate rather than acetate for the buffer.  The liquid product is packaged in 1 ml pre-
filled syringes and can be used without further reconstitution. 
For  patients  treated  with  Zarzio  diluted  to  concentrations  <  1.5 MU/ml (15 µg/ml),  human  serum 
albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. 
When diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution, Zarzio is compatible with glass and a variety of 
plastics including polyvinylchloride, polyolefin (a copolymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and 
polypropylene. 
Adventitious Agents 
No materials of animal or human origin are used to manufacture Zarzio active substance or medicinal 
product.  Some  reagents  derived  from  bovine  milk  protein  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of 
chromatography columns, but the suppliers certify these comply with requirements.  
Both  the  active  substance  and  medicinal  product  manufacturing  processes  are  well  controlled  for 
microbiological safety. Master and working cell banks have undergone appropriate testing. 
Manufacture of the Product 
Manufacturing consists of mixing active substance with excipients and adjustment of pH followed by 
filtration and filling into pre-sterilised syringes. The manufacturing process is controlled by a series of 
in-process controls. Validation was performed on both presentations 30MU and 48MU. All excipients 
conform to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.

Product Specification 
Medicinal  product  specification  was  justified  by  characterisation  and  batch  data,  and  analyses 
performed. 
Stability of the Product 
Stability data from development batches supports a medicinal product shelf-life of 30 months at 5±3°C 
for both presentations. Photostability testing confirmed that the pre-filled syringes should be kept in 
the outer cartons in order to protect from light. 
Comparability Exercise for Medicinal Product  
Product related impurities were thoroughly investigated; aggregates, and truncated forms showed no 
significant  differences. The  data  show  a consistently  lower level  of  deamidated  and  oxidised  forms. 
The difference does not appear to impact on bioactivity (in vitro bioassay) or stability. 
In conclusion, the physicochemical and biological analysis of Zarzio fully supports its biosimilarity to 
Neupogen. medicinal product composition of Zarzio and Neupogen are quantitatively identical except 
the buffer system for Zarzio is glutamate and for Neupogen it is acetate.

Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality dossier for Zarzio is well presented fulfilling the requirements of a biosimilar application. 
The physico-chemical and biological comparability studies using Neupogen from the German market 
as reference product were performed using a large set of state of the art analytical methods showing no 
significant  differences.  The  composition  of  Zarzio  is  identical  to  the  reference  product  Neupogen 
except  for  the  buffer  system.  Development  studies  using  a  number  of  buffer  systems  led  to  the 
conclusion that both buffer systems are equally suitable for filgrastim formulations.  Pharmaceutical 
development led to a suitable product. 
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The non-clinical testing strategy was aimed at comparing the marketed reference product Neupogen 
with  filgrastim.  In  an  in  vitro  NFS-60  cell  assay,  filgrastim  and  the  reference  drug  Neupogen  were 
compared  for  ability  to  interact  with  the  G-CSF  receptor.  Filgrastim  was  also  compared  with 
Neupogen  in  four  animal  studies  assessing  pharmacodynamics,  toxicity,  toxicokinetics,  and  local 
tolerance (table 1).

Batches  used  in  nonclinical  studies  were  released  with  the  same  analytical  and  quality  control 
procedures  established  for  batches  in  clinical  studies.  All  batches  released  for  the  non-clinical  and 
clinical studies were stated to meet the criteria of equal relative dose potency compared to the G-CSF 
standard. 
All non-clinical studies were stated to be conducted in GLP –certified contract institutions. However, 
an  additional  study  on  the  determination  of  G-CSF  level  ‘Determination  of  rhG-CSF  in  rat  serum 
using ELISA’ (additional experiments), performed by BioProof AG, was not conducted in compliance 
with GLP. 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics  
The  in  vitro  pharmacological  evaluation  of  filgrastim  was  performed  using  the  NFS-60  cell 
proliferation assay. This in vitro cell assay is based on the ability of murine myeloblastic NFS-60 cells 
to proliferate in response to G-CSF. The in vitro potency of all recombinant G-CSF samples produced 
was evaluated by a parallel-line assay format according to the European Pharmacopoeia 1997, Chapter 
3.5  (Statistical  analysis  of  results  of  biological  assays  and  tests).  The  estimates  for  relative  dose 
potency of filgrastim and Neupogen are presented in Table 2.

* Batches starting with #N refer to Neupogen batches, all other batches are filgrastim batches. The third column 
depicts the activity in percent of the activity of the reference standard, whereas the sixth column lists the specific 
activity in units per mg. The activity of the reference standard is declared as 1.0 x 108 U/mg. 
The  in  vivo  potency  of  filgrastim  was  investigated  in  normal  (part  A  of  Study  EP06-004)  and 
neutropenic rats (part B of Study EP06-004). In Part A of Study EP06-004, filgrastim, Neupogen or 
control solution were administered subcutaneously on four consecutive days (day 1-4) to male CD rats 
at dose levels of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160µg/kg. Blood samples were taken at approximately the same 
time in the morning before dosing on day 1 and on test days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12. The kinetics of 
the neutrophil response for filgrastim and Neupogen treatment are shown in Figure 1. The integrated

The corresponding areas under the effect curve (AUEC days 0-12) for neutrophil count of filgrastim (S) and 
Neupogen (N) at each dose level (10 to 160 µg/kg) are plotted side by side. 
The  number  of  eosinophilic  and  basophilic  granulocytes  increased  slightly  in  all  filgrastim  and 
Neupogen treated groups 2-5 days after the first dosing, with the increase being more pronounced at 
160  mg/kg.  Monocyte  counts  increased  in  all  filgrastim  and  Neupogen  treated  groups  in  a  dose-
dependent  manner  2  to  5  days  after  the  first  dosing.  While  the  number  of  LUCs  increased  in  all 
filgrastim- or Neupogen-treated groups, the absolute numbers of LUCs remained low. 
The descriptive comparison of the AUEC by means of 95% confidence intervals for the ratio of the 
means for ANC and maximal neutrophil counts (Emax) are shown in Table 3.

In neutropenic rats ( Part B of Study EP06-004), male CD rats were allocated to three dose groups (30, 
60, and 100 µg/kg). On day 0 of the study, animals received a single intraperitoneal dose of 50 mg/kg 
cyclophosphamide (CPA) inducing neutropenia. Filgrastim, Neupogen or control solution (0.9% NaCl 
= vehicle/diluent solution for filgrastim) were subcutaneously administered on four consecutive days 
(days 1-4). An additional control group of normal rats received neither CPA nor rhG-CSF. In analogy 
to  definitions  used  in  humans,  neutropenia  in  rats  was  defined  as  ANC  that  was  two  standard 
deviations below the normal mean ANC for untreated control animals, and the duration of neutropenia 
was compared between the groups.

Induction of neutropenia by CPA produced a reduction of ANCs and WBC counts with a maximum on 
test days 3-4 followed by recovery to normal values by days 8 (ANC) and 12 (WBC). Groups treated 
with either filgrastim or Neupogen showed a dosage-dependent increase in mean ANCs on days 2, 3, 5 
and 6 compared to neutropenic control animals that did not receive rhG-CSF (Figure 3). Duration of 
neutropenia is shown in table 4.

Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
A  4-week  repeated-dose  toxicity  study  with  a  6-week  recovery  period  (study  EP06-001)  was 
conducted  in  male  and  female  Wistar  rats  to  compare  the  toxicological  endpoints  of  filgrastim  and 
Neupogen.  Both  products were  given  s.c.  once  daily  over  a  period  of  28  days.  Three  groups  of  rats 
were treated with three different doses of filgrastim (20, 100 and 500 µg/kg b.w.) and 2 groups were 
treated with Neupogen  doses corresponding to the low and high doses of filgrastim. One group was 
treated with vehicle (formulation buffer) and served as a control.  
The  low  dose  (20µg/kg/day)  was  chosen  to  correspond  to  the  highest  human  dose  (24µg/kg/day) 
recommended for patients with severe chronic neutropenia. The high dose (500µg/kg/day) was chosen 
as  approximately  equivalent  to  20-fold  the  highest  human  dose  (24µg/kg/day)  recommended  for 
severe chronic neutropenia and about 50-fold above the dose for mobilization of autologous peripheral 
blood  progenitor  cells  (10µg/kg/day).  The  intermediate  dose  was  chosen  as  the  logarithmic  mean 
between the high and the low dose. 
During the treatment period, the numbers of WBC and in particular the number of neutrophils were 
increased  above  the  normal  range  in  filgrastim  and  in  Neupogen  dose  groups  (Table  5).  For  both 
filgrastim and Neupogen, the increase in the WBC number was dose-dependent on days 14 and 28 and 
was more marked in males than in females. At the end of the recovery period (study day 70), WBC 
levels  had  returned  to  the  normal  range  of  variation  for  this  species.  Mean  serum  G-CSF  levels 
decreased from more than 300 pg/ml in the high dose groups (500µg/kg) to non-detectable levels at 
day  70.  A  relatively  small but  significant increase  in neutrophil count  was  observed  on  day  3  in  all 
animals treated with filgrastim, with the exception of the low-dose group females. On study day 14, 
the  number  of  neutrophils  had  further  increased  dose-dependently  reaching  levels  10-  to  12-fold 
higher  than  controls.  No  difference  was  found  between  the  genders.  On  study  day  28,  a  further 
increase in the number of neutrophils in males was found in the high dose filgrastim group (20-fold 
higher  than  controls),  with  no  change  in  respective  females.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  the 
number of neutrophils had returned to levels within the normal range of variation for this species. The 
same pattern of neutrophil kinetics was found in Neupogen treated animals.

On  day  28  all  rhG-CSF  levels  of  test  items  from  the  control  group  and  those  animals  treated  with 
20µg/kg rhG-CSF (either Neupogen or filgrastim), as well as all from the second withdrawal on study 
day  70  were  below  the  limit  of  quantification.  Four  of  ten  test  items  from  the  animals  treated  with 
100µg/kg filgrastim withdrawn on study day 28 yielded results between 88 and 159pg/ml rhG-CSF. 
Analysis  of  all  test  items  from  those  animals  treated  with  500µg/ml  rhG-CSF  (either  Neupogen  or 
filgrastim)  yielded  results within  the  calibration range  of the  ELISA:  Neupogen-treated animals had 
rhG-CSF serum concentrations between 243 and 569pg/ml, whereas the concentration of rhG-CSF in 
serum from filgrastim-treated rats ranged from 266 and 1376pg/ml.  
Increased IgG levels were observed with a similar frequency in the filgrastim, Neupogen and control 
groups.  Immunoglobulin  A,  E,  G,  and  M  levels  were  determined  in  110  samples  at  the  end  of 
treatment and at the end of recovery. Samples including those from the control group showed similar 
IgA,  IgE  and  IgM  concentrations  on  study  day  70  compared  to  study  day  28.  Increased  IgG  levels 
were  found  in  the  samples  of  day  70  compared  to  the  samples  of  study  day  28.  This  increase  was 
independent of the dose of filgrastim or Neupogen administered and was claimed to be in accordance 
with the age-dependent increase in IgG reported for rats aged 6 to 30 weeks (Salauze, Serre and Perrin 
1994). 
Antibodies against rhG-CSF were analyzed on day 7, at the end of the treatment period (day 28) and at 
the end of the recovery period (day 70) using a validated ELISA assay for the detection of anti-rhG-
CSF antibodies. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the assay was 60 nU/ml. At the end of 
the 6-week recovery period it could be excluded that active substance was present which might have 
interfered with the ability to detect anti-drug antibodies. No rhG-CSF was detectable at the end of the 
recovery period. In Figure 4 the results of the rhG-CSF antibody ELISA in serum of male and female 
rats on study day 7, 28 and 70 in all groups are shown.

The mean concentration detected with the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA in serum of non-treated six 
week old rats was 330 nU/ml (baseline), a value reflecting a non-specific signal in the antibody assay. 
All  results  shown  in  Figure  4  were  corrected  by  subtraction  of this  baseline  concentration.  A  signal 
above the LLOQ was detected in 117 out of 170 samples tested on study days 7, 28 and 70. At the end 
of treatment week one (day 7) the signals detected in the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA were below 
the LLOQ in most of the female animals in all treatment groups, whereas a signal above the LLOQ 
could  be  detected  in  serum  of  two  to  three  males  in  all  groups.  However,  with  a  maximum  of 
200 nU/ml the signal intensity of these male rats was relatively low. During the course of the study, 
the  signal  in  the  anti-rhG-CSF  antibody  ELISA  increased in  all  tested  groups,  including  the  control 
group  although  this  control  group  was  clearly  not  treated  with  the  rhG-CSF  as  the  number  of 
neutrophils did not increase during the course of the study. On day 28 the ELISA signals were only 
slightly  higher  than  on  study  day  7.  Increased  levels  were  independent  of  drug,  dose  or  gender  and 
were also found in controls of both genders. At the end of the recovery period (day 70) all test items 
yielded results between 372 and 1499 nU/ml, including the control group. The signal intensities in the 
anti-rhG-CSF  ELISA  were  higher  in  females  than  in  males,  especially  in  the  high  dose  group  of 
filgrastim and the low dose group of Neupogen. Throughout the study, slightly increased signals in the

anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA were found in both the filgrastim and the Neupogen treatment groups. 
However,  signal  intensities  were  comparable  in  both  treatment  groups  and  were  also  comparable  to 
those in serum of animals from the control group.  
Pre-incubation of serum samples with rhG-CSF in a confirmatory assay did not result in a reduction of 
the signal in the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA compared to serum samples without pre-incubation.

Toxicokinetic data 
In  the  toxicokinetic  study  EP06-002  fifty  animals  were  treated  daily  for  14  days  with  filgrastim  or 
Neupogen  and  serum  kinetics  were  evaluated  after  the  first  and  last  treatment  day  to  assess  the 
systemic availability of the two compounds. Three groups were treated with filgrastim at dose levels 
of 20, 100 or 500ug/kg b.w. The concentration of rhG-CSF in rat serum samples taken after single and 
repeated  dosing  was  determined  using  a  commercially  available  ELISA  kit  (Quantikine  human  G-
CSF, R&D Systems) without modifications. In this study, no mortality and no significant alterations in 
body weight gain were found after administration of filgrastim or Neupogen. At all three dose levels 
of  filgrastim,  no  significant  differences  in  serum  concentrations  (Cmax)  and  a  small  increase  of  the 
AUC(0-14d)  were  found  between  single  and  repeated  dosing.  After  repeated  treatment  with  the  two 
Neupogen doses, an increase in both serum concentrations (Cmax) and AUC(0-14d) was found compared 
to  single  dosing  (Table  6).  Dose-exposure linearity  was  found  for  filgrastim.  Serum  exposure under 
Neupogen increased with repeated dosing as compared to study day 0.

Local tolerance  
In study EP06-001, a local tolerance test performed in 36 female rabbits, the local tolerability of two 
formulations of filgrastim containing acetate buffer (Neupogen-like) and containing glutamate buffer 
(filgrastim-final  formulation)  was  compared  to  the  reference  product  Neupogen.  Two  groups  of 
animals were treated with 480 µg/0.5 ml filgrastim in two different formulations and with saline 0.9% 
as contralateral control and the third group was treated with 480 µg/0.5 ml Neupogen and saline 0.9% 
as control. The dose was administered as a single bolus injection by the i.v., paravenous (p.v.), s.c., 
intramuscular (i.m.), or intraarterial (i.a.) route. This dose corresponds to the highest concentration of 
Page 17 of 33 
 
rhG-CSF  administered  to  humans  as  bolus  injection.  Both  formulations  of  filgrastim  were  equally 
well tolerated as the reference product Neupogen and showed similar local tolerability to the control 
(data not shown). No clinically relevant reactions were observed.

Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical evaluation of filgrastim was performed in full accordance with the EMEA guideline 
on  biosimilar  G-CSF  (EMEA/CHMP/31329/05.  In 
the  guideline,  no  secondary 
pharmacodynamics,  safety  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics,  single-dose  toxicity,  carcinogenicity  or 
reproductive toxicity studies were performed. 
line  with 
For the repeat-dose toxicology (study EP06-001) and toxicokinetic (study EP06-002), filgrastim drug 
substance was formulated in the reference (Neupogen) formulation. The local tolerance (study EP06-
003)  as  well  as  the  pharmacology  (study  EP06-004)  were  done  with  the  glutamic  acid  containing 
formulation. All clinical studies were done with the glutamic acid formulation. 
Filgrastim and Neupogen showed comparable ability to interact with the G-CSF receptor in an in vitro 
NFS-60 cell assay. In normal and neutropenic rats, at all dose levels tested, filgrastim and Neupogen 
resulted  in  a  dose-dependent  increase  of  ANC.  Similar  pharmacodynamic  response  to  the  two 
compounds was noted in the comparative animal study across a wide dose range. 
The toxicity of filgrastim was assessed in a 4-week repeated dose study conducted at doses of 20, 100 
and 500 µg/kg. There were no deaths. There were overt signs of toxicity and body weight was reduced 
in  only  a  limited  number  of  animals.  These  effects  were  dose  dependent  and  gradually  disappeared 
during  the  6  weeks  recovery  period.  The  treatment  related  effects  were  limited  to  those  anticipated 
after  G-CSF  administration  such  as  slight  increase  in  spleen  weight  and  myeloid  hyperplasia  in  the 
bone marrow and probably represent an exaggerated pharmacological response. 
The toxicokinetics confirmed that the test animals were systemically exposed to the test compounds, 
and there was dose-linearity in the case of filgrastim. 
Both filgrastim formulations showed identical local tolerance results and since both formulations are 
composed of well known and well characterised excipients it can be expected that the tolerability of 
the glutamate formulation will be similar to that of the acetate formulation.  
The immunogenicity of filgrastim was assessed as part of the toxicity study. Increased signals in the 
anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA were detected both in filgrastim and Neupogen treated and control rats 
in  the  28-day  study.  Signal  intensities  were  found  to  increase  with  time  in  both  filgrastim  and 
Neupogen as well as in the control group and were comparable in all treatment groups including the 
control  group.  This  effect  was  considered  to  be  a  combined  phenomenon  of  unspecific  binding  and 
normal age-dependent increase of IgGs in rats and it may be concluded that the observed increase in 
ELISA reactivity was due to the assay design and no formation of anti-rhG-CSF antibodies occurred 
during  the  study  period.  Whilst  immunogenicity  results  in  the  rat  might  not  be  fully  predictive  for 
human  risk  assessment,  it  is  worth  noting  that  no  difference  between  filgrastim  and  Neupogen  and 
control  animals  was  detected  in  this  study.  No  antibodies  against  filgrastim  were  reported  in  the 
clinical studies. 
Other toxicity studies are not required for a biosimilar G-CSF development according to the respective 
EMEA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/31329/05). 
The amino acid sequence of human filgrastim occurs naturally and is composed entirely of naturally 
occurring amino acids and would be expected to react like a naturally occurring protein both in vivo 
Page 18 of 33 
 
 
and  in  the  environment.  According  to  the  CHMP  guideline  on  ‘Environmental  risk  assessment  of 
medicinal products for human use’ (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), an environmental risk assessment 
is not required in the cases of vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and 
lipids because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.” 
In  conclusion,  the  pharmacodynamic  and  toxicologic  studies  performed  by  the  applicant  were  in 
accordance with the EMEA guidance for biosimilar rhG-CSF development. The preclinical program 
confirmed that the activity and toxicity is equivalent between filgrastim and Neupogen. 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Four  PK/PD  studies  were  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers  in  order  to  demonstrate  comparability  of 
pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  both  products  as  well  as  pharmacodynamics,  in  accordance  to 
CHMP  scientific  advice.  Two  routes  (intravenous  and  subcutaneous)  and  four  doses  were  tested, 
which span the steep part of the dose-response curve: 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 µg/kg. The design of the three 
PK/PD phase I studies is summarised in Table 7.

Pharmacodynamics 
PD activity was based primarily on ANC peak response and ANC exposure, i.e. the whole AUC over 
10 days. The results of these studies support the comparability of the test and reference products with 
respect  to  their  pharmacodynamic  effect  since  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  curves  are 
superimposable whatever the route and the dose. 
An example is shown in figure 5 for a 7-day treatment course at the dose of 5 µg/kg/d subcutaneously.

Time after first administration (h)
The  results  for the  primary  endpoint  of the area  under  the effect  curve  (AUEC)  calculated from  the 
first  time  of  administration  to  the  last  blood  sampling  are  summarised  in  Table  8  for  the  different 
routes and doses. AUEC increases with increasing dose but the dose response curve is rather flat for 
both products; while doubling the dose from 2.5 to 5 µg/kg, AUEC only increases by about 20%.

Pharmacokinetics 
AUCs and Cmax 
The results of the 24-hour AUCs and Cmax after the first and 7th dose - as estimated by standard non 
compartmental PK analysis - are presented in Tables 10 and 11, respectively.  Repeated dosing led to a 
decrease in serum G-CSF exposure as shown by a 2-3 fold decrease in Cmax and 3-5 fold decrease in 
24-hour AUC from Day 1 to Day 7. This is in line with the predominant receptor mediated clearance 
of filgrastim; while neutrophil counts increase in response to repeated dosing of filgrastim, clearance 
of filgrastim is enhanced.

The standard acceptance range of 80-125% is recommended in the Guideline to show biosimilarity of 
G-CSFs.  At the lower doses and after a multiple s.c. dose of 5 µg/kg, AUC and Cmax failed to meet the 
bioequivalence  criteria  (shaded  values).    Serum  levels  of  free  G-CSF  were  lower  after  the 
administration of filgrastim than after that of Neupogen; the difference appeared consistent across the 
routes and doses and was statistically significant since the confidence intervals were entirely below the 
100% value. 
According to the applicant, this difference was unlikely to be due to a different level of sensitivity of 
the  G-CSF  analytical  assay  or  to  a  systematic  difference  in  baseline  neutrophil  counts,  which  were 
very  similar  between  the  two  products;  it  had  also  been  confirmed  that  both  products  exhibited  the 
same  stability  in  blood.  Furthermore,  different  batches  of  drug  substance  with  very  similar  potency 
Page 21 of 33 
 
 
 
 
 
were used in the trials. The applicant claimed that the observed differences were due to differences in 
the levels of purity of the two products, leading to a systematic bias toward an apparently increased 
bioavailability for the reference product.

Based on the ELISA-detectable dose, the confidence intervals for all AUCs were contained within the 
standard acceptance interval. As for Cmax, it remained outside the standard acceptance interval of 80-
125% following a single s.c. dose of 2.5 µg/kg (but not 1 µg/kg) and a multiple dose of both 2.5 and 5 
µg/kg (shaded values).  
Elimination parameters 
Equivalence  of  the  elimination  half-life  was  also  studied.  However,  there  is  no  true  half-life  for  G-
CSF,  due  to  the  saturable  capture  of  the  drug  by  the  receptor  and  the  stimulation  of  the  G-CSF 
receptor  by  the  drug,  which  is  dose  and  time-dependent.  Consequently,  there  is  no  log-linear  phase 
over an entire concentration time profile. 
At  10  µg/kg  after  single  dose,  the  log-linear  phase  was  apparent  because  there  was  no  sampling 
Page 22 of 33 
 
 
 
 
 
beyond  24  hours  and  the  receptor  system  was  always  saturated.  After  multiple  dose  administration, 
however,  several  subjects  had  only  two  points  that  could  be  used  for  the  estimation  of  kel  since  the 
concentration-time curve did not exhibit a log-linear decay for more than these timepoints. Therefore, 
the comparison between the two treatments was additionally carried out for the subgroup of subjects 
(14  out  of  32)  for  whom  the  estimates  of  kel  and  t1/2  were  based  on  at  least  three  points.  The  two 
treatments were compared with respect to kel and t1/2 by means of 90% confidence intervals calculated 
from  an  ANOVA  model  identical  to  the  one  for  the  PK  bioequivalence  assessment.  The  ratios  and 
corresponding 90% CIs show the equivalence between the two treatments in terms of the elimination 
half-lives. The comparison of elimination parameters is shown in table 14. 
Table 14  Comparison of elimination parameters at 10 µg/kg/day 
The results for the 2.5 µg/kg and the 5 µg/kg dose for both single and multiple dose application are 
shown in Table 15. While the single-dose elimination half-lives were still within the bioequivalence 
limits the differences between the two treatments seemed to increase with the number of applications, 
the effect being more pronounced in the lower dose group. However, the applicant claimed that due to 
the non-linear pharmacokinetics of filgrastim the estimation of the elimination parameters in the non-
compartmental analysis did not properly describe the actual elimination of the drug. 
Table 15  Comparison of elimination parameters at 2.5 and 5 µg/kg/day 
Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  endpoint  met  the  predefined comparability  criterion  and,  even if  the 
comparability range calculated by the Applicant may be questioned, the actual results are very close. 
The  predefined  equivalence  boundaries  were  derived  by  the  Applicant  from  published  data  on  the 
effect  observed  for  Neupogen  compared  to  placebo.  It  was  assumed  that  the  smallest  clinically 
relevant  difference  in  PD  response  between  the  test  and  reference  product  was  15%  of  the  effect 
observed  for  Neupogen  compared  to  placebo  in  the  published  study.  Decreasing  this  margin  to 
10%, which approximately corresponds to half the increase in AUEC between the 2.5 and 5 
µg/kg  doses,  would  result  in  more  acceptable  equivalence  intervals;  indeed,  the  95%  CI  for 
ANC AUEC and Emax in study EP06-103 would still fall within these tighter equivalence boundaries. 
Page 23 of 33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A statistically significant period effect was reported in all the cross-over studies, the ANC response in 
the second period being generally greater than in the first period. However, this effect was roughly the 
same  whatever  product  was  administered  first.  In  addition,  a  post-hoc  analysis  restricted to  the  first 
period also supported the comparability of the ANC response. 
It  is  noteworthy  that,  in  spite of the  content  correction  in  pharmacokinetic  studies,  most  results  still 
demonstrate that the subcutaneous route produces significantly lower concentrations of free filgrastim 
in  the  serum  with  filgrastim  than  with  Neupogen.  However,  it  is  reassuring  that  the  results  after 
correction provide point estimates for the ratios of the intravenous infusion that are very close to 100% 
with CIs including 100%. 
It is acknowledged that the apparent difference in bioavailability may be overestimated due to the non 
linear saturable pharmacokinetics of rhG-CSF, which is eliminated for a large part through binding to 
its  target  cells,  neutrophils  and  myeloid  progenitors.  Indeed,  the  difference  in  elimination 
characteristics at different doses may be related to the fact that receptor-mediated clearance (which is 
saturable)  is  predominant  at  lower  doses,  while  renal  clearance  becomes  more  important  at  higher 
doses. 
The Applicant also performed a modelling exercise to interpret serum concentration data in the context 
of  the  target-mediated  nonlinear  pharmacokinetics;  this  also  allowed  comparing  relevant  PK 
parameters  which  cannot  be  estimated  through  non-compartmental  analysis,  such  as  clearances  and 
volumes  of  distribution  (data  not  shown).  First,  an  individual  best  fit  model  was  developed  and  to 
further test its robustness under multiple dosing, two types of population models were developed: an 
empirical  population  model  directly  derived  from  the  individual  best  fit  model  and  a  mechanistic 
population  model  taking  into  account  the  target  mediated  drug  disposition.  From  these  population 
model  analyses,  it  could  be  concluded  that  the  main  findings  of  the  individual  best  fit  model  were 
confirmed, even though these models are quite different and are built based on different assumptions 
and  different  parameters.  In  either  approach,  all  parameters  estimated  satisfied  the  common 
bioequivalence criteria for all doses and for both routes of administration. 
The  Applicant  also  provided  a  comprehensive  demonstration  of  the  mechanism  underlying  the 
inflation  of  the  difference  between  the  two  products  as  doses  are  decreased  or  repeated.  Since  the 
greatest inflation  occurs  when there are  high  levels  of  receptors relative to  drug,  the  PK  differences 
observed  in  healthy  volunteers  are  likely  to  substantially  overestimate  differences  in  the  target 
neutropenic population. 
In  conclusion,  the  small  differences  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  filgrastim  are  not 
expected to translate into significant differences in the PD response, which is related to the amount of 
filgrastim bound to its target cells. 
Clinical efficacy  
The  comparability  of  the  efficacy  based  on  a  PD  study  in  healthy  volunteers  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP in their Scientific Advice to the Applicant. Furthermore, the extrapolation to 
all indications of the reference products was considered acceptable since the mechanism of action is 
the  same,  i.e.  direct  stimulation  of  bone  marrow  cells  through  one  specific  type  of  surface  receptor 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005). Thus, the applicant only submitted a supportive clinical efficacy 
study. 
• 
Supportive studies 
Supportive evidence of efficacy was provided by the results of a phase III study, the primary objective 
of which was the evaluation of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of filgrastim. Study EP06-
301  was  designed  as  an  open,  single-arm,  multicentre  study  in  chemotherapy-naïve  breast  cancer 
patients receiving doxorubicin and docetaxel chemotherapy and filgrastim as primary prophylaxis of 
severe neutropenia. Treatment consisted of filgrastim from day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle for up to 
14 days (or until ANC reached 10 x 109/L post nadir), repeated for up to 4 cycles. The total daily dose 
was 30 MIU for women weighing <60 kg and 48 MIU for women weighing ≥60 kg. Each subject was 
expected  to  participate  in  the  study  for  approximately  6  months,  including  three  months  of  active 
treatment  (4  treatment  cycles)  and  3  months  of  follow-up  after  the  last  treatment  cycle.  The  main 
efficacy variables were the incidence and duration of severe neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4, the incidence 
of  febrile  neutropenia,  the  time  to  neutrophil  recovery.  The  main  results  are  shown  in  Table  16 
Page 24 of 33 
together with data on the available published data for the reference product Neupogen (Holmes, 2002 
and Green, 2003, see references below).

The  comparability  of  the  efficacy  based  on  a  PD  study  in  healthy  volunteers  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP in their Scientific Advice to the Applicant. Furthermore, the extrapolation to

Safety in healthy volunteers 
A comparison of the safety profile of the test and reference products was provided based on the four 
studies  in  146  healthy  volunteers.  ADRs  were  consistent  with  those  reported  in  normal  donors  as 
described in AMGEN Neupogen SmPC and were similar for both products (data not shown). 
The  evaluation  of  the  immune  response  after  rhG-CSF  administration  was  made  by  a  three-step 
procedure  comprising  a  validated  radioimmunoprecipitation  assay  and  a  validated  cell-based 
neutralization antibody assay. Serum samples for antibody analysis were taken at baseline (screening), 
one hour before the start of treatment period II and at follow-up. At these time points, the presence of 
active  substance,  which  might  interfere  with  the  ability  to  detect  anti-  rhG-CSF  antibodies,  may  be 
excluded because rhG-CSF levels would have returned to normal values. Samples were taken in Study 
EP06-102 – single iv dose, Study EP06-103 – repeated sc dose (2.5 and 5 µg/kg), and Study EP06-101 
– repeated sc dose (10 µg/kg). None of the volunteers developed anti-rhG-CSF binding antibodies at 
any time-point of the studies.

Patient exposure 
The  clinical  study  EP06-301  was  primarily  designed  to  assess  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of 
filgrastim in 170 breast cancer patients (see clinical efficacy). The patient exposure is summarised in 
Table 17. The mean total daily dose was approximately 440 µg (44 MU). The mean cumulative dose 
ranged from 3323 to 3834 µg across cycles and was 13612 µg for the whole treatment period.

Of  the  170  enrolled  patients,  154  (91%)  patients  received  4  chemotherapy  treatments.  One  patient 
withdrew during the fourth cycle; therefore, 153 patients completed four treatment cycles. The mean 
extent of exposure to the chemotherapy was 81 days, with a range of 21 to 113 days.  
The  doses  of  doxorubicin  (60  mg/m2)  and  docetaxel  (75  mg/m2)  had  to  be  reduced  by  25%  to  45 
mg/m2 and 56.25 mg/m2, respectively, in 10 (6%) patients due to febrile neutropenia.  
• 
Adverse events 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs reported after the first dose of study 
chemotherapy through 30 days after the last dose. 
A total of 1583 TEAEs were reported during the study affecting all 170 patients. The analysis of the 
adverse events distinguished between “G-CSF associated adverse events” (i.e. increases in AST, LDH, 
arthralgia, myalgia, back pain, bone pain, pain in extremities) and all other events identified as “non 
G-CSF associated adverse events”. 
Among the latter events (1494), a relationship to filgrastim was suspected for 50 (3%) AEs reported 
during the treatment period, while a relationship to study chemotherapy was suspected for 1264 (85%) 
TEAEs. 
Of  the  89  G-CSF  associated  events,  44  (49%)  were  considered  to  be  related  to  filgrastim  while  49 
(54%)  were  suspected to  chemotherapy-related. The intensities  of the  G-CSF  related adverse events 
were mainly mild (89%) or at most moderate (11%) (see Table 18).

Among the non G-CSF associated adverse events suspected to be related to filgrastim, only “fatigue” 
was  reported  in  more  than  a  single  patient  (6  cases);  this  common  event  was  usually  attributed  to 
chemotherapy. 
Local  tolerance  at  the  injection  site  was  to  be  summarised  by  signs/symptoms,  relationship  to 
filgrastim  and  severity  for  related  events.  No  occurrences  of  itching,  redness,  swelling,  pain, 
ulcerations or other signs and symptoms of poor local tolerability of filgrastim were observed. 
• 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Three patients died during the follow-up period, two due to disease progression (both these patients 
had stage IV breast cancer at screening) and one due to injuries suffered in a car accident. 
Twenty patients reported 23 SAEs, including the 3 deaths described above. The other 20 other SAEs 
included: febrile neutropenia (14): grade 4 (11), grade 3 (2), grade 2 (1); diarrhea (2 patients); anaemia 
(1); atrial fibrillation (1); hepatitis (1); hypertensive crisis (1). Three patients were withdrawn from the 
study due to AEs: one case of febrile neutropenia in the first cycle, which resolved in 25 days; one 
case of atrial fibrillation in the 2nd cycle, which resolved in 2 days; one case of non-serious allergic 
dermatitis  in  the  face  beginning  on  Day  7  of  the  3rd  cycle,  which  resolved  in  21  days;  as  the 
investigator considered the relationship to filgrastim highly probable, the patient did not receive a 4th 
chemotherapy cycle. 
• 
Laboratory findings 
During  the  treatment  period,  none  of  the  patients  had  a  CTC  grade  4  value  for  any  biochemistry 
parameter.  Grade  3  values  were  observed  only  for  alkaline  phosphatase  (1  patient)  and  gamma 
glutamyl  transferase  (4  patients).  As  expected,  all  patients  had  at  least  one  haematological 
abnormality, in keeping with myelosuppression associated with chemotherapy. 
Page 27 of 33 
 
 
 
 
Only  a  small  fraction  of  laboratory  abnormalities  were  judged  by  the  investigator  to  be  clinically 
significant at any time during the treatment period: ALT (3 patients; 1.8%), AST (2 patients; 1.2%); 
LDH (2 patients; 1.2%). Even for haematology parameters, <2% of patients had clinically significant 
abnormalities during the treatment period. 
• 
Immunogenicity studies 
Serum samples for antibody analysis were taken at baseline (screening) or at day 1 of cycle 1 (C1D1), 
at day 1 of cycle 2 (C2D1), at day 21 of cycle 4 (C4D21) and at study termination (day 91). At the 
chosen time-points, the presence of active substance, which might interfere with the ability to detect 
anti- rhG-CSF antibodies, is not expected. Table 20 summarizes the assessment of antibody formation 
in serum samples collected during the study.

All samples  were  first analysed  in  the  screening  RIP  assay.  Of  the  643  analysed  samples,  629  were 
negative. The fourteen samples with total binding values >2.27% were re-analysed in a confirmatory 
RIP assay. As all depletion rates were <20%, the samples were qualified as negative. Thus, none of the 
patients developed anti-rhG-CSF binding antibodies at any time-point of the study.

Discussion on clinical safety 
A direct comparison of the safety profile of the test and reference products is possible from the four 
studies  in  146  healthy  volunteers  (data  not  shown).  ADRs  were  consistent  with  those  reported  in 
normal donors as described in the Neupogen SmPC and were similar for both products. Overall, these 
data support the comparability of the products. 
The  clinical  study  EP06-301  was  primarily  designed  to  assess  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of 
filgrastim in 170 breast cancer patients. As for efficacy evaluation, the type of patients included in the 
trial  and the differences in  exposure  hamper  a  proper  comparison  with  historical  data  of  Neupogen; 
therefore, these safety data are considered of limited value to support the comparability of the test and 
reference products. 
Overall,  filgrastim  was  very  well  tolerated  by  these  cancer  patients  although  their  exposure  to 
filgrastim was not consistent with the literature data for the reference product. Indeed, since the dose 
was not adjusted to bodyweight, only 22% of the patients received doses included between 4.5 and 5.5 
µg/kg while 75% received higher doses up to 8 µg/kg.  
In addition, due to misunderstanding of the treatment protocol by some investigators, a small number 
of patients received unduly short treatment courses. 
Immunogenicity data in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients showed no evidence of IgG antibody 
formation against rhG-CSF, a finding consistent with the known low immunogenicity of Neupogen. 
Since PK and PD results are considered sufficiently comparable to support the biosimilarity of the test 
and  reference  products,  a  robust  (head to  head)  comparison  of their long-term  safety  is less  critical. 
The  small  single-arm  trial  submitted  by  the  Applicant  allows,  to  a  certain  extent,  to  rule  out  any 
Page 28 of 33 
 
 
 
 
 
unexpected safety issue and suggests low immunogenicity of the test product. Additional safety and 
immunogenicity data will be collected post-marketing within the frame of two registries included in 
the Risk Management Plan. 
Ongoing safety follow-up will be performed on healthy subjects included in the Phase I studies (EP06-
103) and two post-marketing studies: a phase IV study in patients with severe chronic neutropenia (12 
months of treatment) with an extended follow-up within the frame of the SNC European registry (5 
years  in  total)  and  a  follow-up  of  healthy  stem  cell  donors  undergoing  PBPC  mobilisation  in  co-
operation with apheresis centres (5 years after mobilisation). The Applicant has committed to submit 
the  protocols  and  study  reports  of  these  three  studies  and  they  have  been  included  as  follow-up 
measures.

2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  composition  of  filgrastim  and  Neupogen  is  quantitatively  similar  except  the  buffer  system  for 
filgrastim is glutamate and for Neupogen it is acetate. The data presented confirm that filgrastim and 
Neupogen  are  comparable  with  respect  to  primary  structure,  secondary  and  tertiary  structure, 
molecular  mass,  hydrophobicity,  molecular  size,  charge,  binding  and  (in  vitro)  bioactivity.  Product 
related  impurities  were  thoroughly  investigated.  Aggregates  and  truncated  forms  showed  no 
significant  differences.  The  data  show  a  consistently  lower  level  of  deamidated  and  oxidised 
forms..These  differences  did  not  appear  to  impact  on  bioactivity  (in  vitro  bioassay)  or  stability.  In 
conclusion, the physicochemical and biological analysis of filgrastim fully supports its biosimilarity to 
Neupogen.  
The Applicant has established the in-house reference standard in absolute terms and has also compared 
it to the comparator product, Neupogen and the WHO International Standard 88/502. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The  toxicity  studies  performed  by  the  Applicant  were  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guidance  for 
biosimilar rhG-CSF development and CHMP scientific advice. No significant differences between the 
products filgrastim and Neupogen were observed. 
Efficacy 
In  line  with  CHMP  Scientific  Advice,  pharmacodynamic  data  in  healthy  volunteers  (absolute 
neutrophil and CD34+ cell counts) were presented to establish the clinical efficacy. The data submitted 
supported the comparability of filgrastim and Neupogen. 
Safety 
A  direct  comparison  of  the  safety  profile  of  the  test  and  reference  products  was  possible  based  on 
studies in healthy volunteers. ADRs associated with filgrastim were consistent with those reported in

normal  donors  as  described  in  AMGEN  Neupogen  SPC.  Overall,  these  data  supported  the 
comparability  of  the  products.  The  small  single-arm  trial  in  cancer  patients  submitted  allowed,  to  a 
certain  extent,  to  rule  out  any  unexpected  safety  issue  and  suggests  low  immunogenicity  of  the  test 
product.  Additional  long-term  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  will  be  collected  post-marketing  as 
described in the RMP.

User consultation 
The Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) has been tested in English in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 
61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. It was found to contain all the 
necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this 
test. The CHMP considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
This application for a recombinant human G-CSF is based on a claim of biosimilarity to an approved 
product (Neupogen). CHMP Guidance has been issued for biotechnology-derived proteins in general, 
and  recently  for  rhG-CSF  in  particular  (non-clinical and  clinical issues). The  Applicant  started  their 
development  before  the  specific  guideline  was  finalised  and  sought  for  CHMP  Scientific  Advice, 
which they generally followed. The primary purpose of this assessment is not the characterisation of 
the  benefit/risk  profile  of  the  product  as  such  but  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  evaluation  of  the 
similarity  of  the  product  to  the  reference  chosen  by  the  Applicant.  The  quality,  non-clinical  and 
clinical data presented supported the comparability of the two products. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Zarzio in the following indications:  
-

Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  patients 
treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic 
myeloid  leukaemia  and  myelodysplastic  syndromes)  and  reduction  in  the  duration  of 
neutropenia  in  patients  undergoing  myeloablative  therapy  followed  by  bone  marrow 
transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.  
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  filgrastim  are  similar  in  adults  and  children  receiving  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  
Mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC).  
In children and adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute 
neutrophil  count  (ANC)  of  ≤ 0.5 x 109/l,  and  a  history  of  severe  or  recurrent  infections,  long 
term  administration  of  filgrastim  is  indicated  to  increase  neutrophil  counts  and  to  reduce  the 
incidence and duration of infection-related events. 
Treatment  of  persistent  neutropenia  (ANC  ≤ 1.0 x 109/l)  in  patients  with  advanced  HIV 
infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other therapeutic options are 
inappropriate. 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

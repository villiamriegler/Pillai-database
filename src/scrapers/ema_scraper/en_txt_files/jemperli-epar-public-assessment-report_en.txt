2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
The claimed indication is: “Dostarlimab is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced 
endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a 
platinum-containing regimen.” 
The population defined as ‘recurrent’ or ‘advanced’ endometrial cancer (EC) is constituted by patients 
with stage ≥ IIIB endometrial cancer that have already received 1 or 2 lines of anti-cancer therapy, 
out of which one must have been a platinum doublet. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors  
Worldwide, there were 417,367 new cases of EC and 97 370 deaths due to EC in 2020. In Europe, 
there were a total of 130,051 new cases of EC and 29,963 deaths due to EC in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 
2020, corpus uteri cancer (ICD-10 category C54)).  
Endometrial cancer is predominantly a disease of post-menopausal women and most common in 
women over 50 years of age. A woman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer by the age of 75 is 
estimated to range from 0.6% in developing countries to 1.6% in developed countries (Jemal A, Bray 
F, Center MM, Ferlay J, Ward E, Forman D. Global cancer statistics. CA Cancer J Clin. 2011 Mar-
Apr;61(2):69-90).  
Risk factors include age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, nulliparity, late menopause, unopposed oestrogen 
intake or oestrogen-producing tumours, a history of breast cancer and the use of tamoxifen (Berek JS, 
Hacker NF. Berek and Hacker’s Gynecologic Oncology. 5th Edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 
2010.). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
EC can be classified as dMMR or mismatch repair (MMR) proficient based on the absence or presence of 
proteins that play a critical role in the MMR process. Defective DNA MMR results in genetic 
hypermutability known as microsatellite instability (MSI). The resulting accumulation of base pair 
mismatches interferes with DNA replication and drives genome instability (Kloor et all, 2016). Genome 
instability can manifest within microsatellites, which are repetitive DNA sequences (1 to 6 bases in 
length) found in coding and noncoding regions throughout the genome, a finding referred to as MSI. In 
literature and industry guidelines, the terms dMMR and MSI-H are used interchangeably. Tumours with 
the highest frequency of this biomarker are colorectal, endometrial and other gastrointestinal cancers 
(Bonneville R et all, 2017). 
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends the MMR immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) as the first method for MSI testing. National comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) colon 
cancer guidelines note that “IHC for MMR and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for MSI are different 
assays measuring the same biological effect”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 11/176 
 
 
  
 
 
EC is one of the cancers with a high observed rate of dMMR/MSI-H (average of approximately 34%). 
The incidence, however, varies depending on histology and tumour grade (Mittica et al, 2017). The 
rate of dMMR/MSI-H is lower in low-grade endometrial tumours (28.6%) than in high-grade 
endometrial tumours (54.3%). Although data on MMR/MSI status in the metastatic setting are limited, 
the rate of dMMR/MSI-H in EC classified as Stage III or IV according to the International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) was shown to range from 6% to 17% (Basil et all, 2000).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis  
Endometrial cancer (EC) develops in the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. This is the most 
common type of uterine cancer, accounting for more than 90 percent of cases.  
Most endometrial carcinomas are diagnosed at an early stage (FIGO stages I or II) since abnormal 
uterine bleeding is the presenting symptom in 90% of cases (ESMO Clinical practice guideline). 
However, an estimated 10%-15% of endometrial carcinomas recur and 80%-90% of recurrences occur 
within 3 years (Sohaib SA et al, 2007). 
The overall prognosis of EC is mainly dependent on the stage at diagnosis and tumour histology. 
Earlier stages and endometrioid histology are associated with better prognosis, whereas advanced 
stages and non-endometrioid histologies such as serous, clear cell, and mixed are known to be 
associated with a worse prognosis (Morice P et al, Endometrial cancer. Lancet. 2016 Mar 
12;387(10023):1094-1108). 
2.1.5.  Management  
Approximately 20% of patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease (Stage III or IV) 
and systemic chemotherapy becomes a critical component of initial treatment, as surgery alone is 
unlikely to cure the disease (Miller DS. 2009;). 
Depending on the extent and location of recurrent disease, histology, and patients’ overall health, 
including comorbidities, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy can be 
considered as treatment options:  
• 
For patients with advanced or recurrent disease of any histological subtype, surgery is 
recommended only when optimal cytoreduction can be achieved.  
• 
Radiation therapy is indicated in patients with an isolated vaginal relapse, and radical 
radiotherapy may be used as primary treatment in patients with unresectable disease or in those who 
have medical contraindications to surgery.  
• 
Systemic palliative therapy options include hormone therapy and chemotherapy; treatment 
selection is based on several factors, including histopathological and clinical features of the patient. 
Hormone therapy is indicated for patients with advanced or recurrent EC and endometrioid histology 
and has demonstrated a favourable toxicity profile. Patients with Grade 1 to 2 endometrioid tumours 
and those with hormone receptor-positive disease are most likely to experience clinical benefit from 
hormone therapy (ESMO Clinical practice guideline). 
Carboplatin and paclitaxel is considered as the standard of care (SOC) in first line setting to treat the 
advanced or metastatic EC based on its similar efficacy and less toxicity compared to cisplatin, 
doxorubicin and paclitaxel (ESMO guidance: Colombo, N et al. ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO Consensus 
Conference on Endometrial Cancer: Diagnosis, Treatment and Follow-up. Int J Gynecol Cancer. 
2016;26(1), 2-30.). 
Assessment report

Page 12/176 
 
 
  
 
 
There are no approved therapies or specific regimens recommended by consensus guidelines as 
standard of care (SOC) for patients who have progressed on or after treatment with a platinum-
containing regimen, (Colombo et al. 2016). 
Currently available systemic therapy options for recurrent or advanced EC in the second-line setting 
(prior exposure to platinum-containing therapy) are summarized in the table below. None of the 
treatments have received approval for use in patients with EC in the EU. 
Table 1: Summary of available endometrial cancer treatments after prior platinum-
containing therapy  
Note: Only limited data are available for these agents, and these are derived from small single-arm, non-registrational studies. 
About the product 
Dostarlimab (also referred to as TSR-042) is a humanised mAb of the IgG4 isotype that binds to PD 1 
receptors and blocks the interactions of binding with its ligands PD L1 and PD L2. The inhibition of PD 1 
pathway mediated immune response results in inhibition of T cell function such as proliferation, 
cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity. Dostarlimab potentiates T-cell responses, including anti 
tumour immuno responses through blockade of PD 1 binding to PD L1 and PD L2. In syngeneic mouse 
tumour models, blocking PD 1 activity resulted in decreased tumour growth (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The recommended indication is as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch 
repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial 
cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen. 
Therapy must be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of 
cancer. 
The identification of dMMR/MSI-H tumour status should be determined using a validated testing 
method such as IHC, PCR or NGS* (see section 5.1 for information on assays used in the studies). 
*IHC=immunohistochemistry; PCR=polymerase chain reaction; NGS=next-generation sequencing.

The recommended dose as monotherapy is 500 mg dostarlimab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 
1000 mg every 6 weeks for all cycles thereafter.  
The dosage regimen is presented in Table 2. 
Table 2. Dosage regimen for patients treated with dostarlimab  
  3 weeks between cycle 4 and cycle 5 
Administration of dostarlimab should continue according to the recommended schedule until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Dose reduction is not recommended. Dosing delay or discontinuation may be required based on 
individual safety and tolerability. Recommended modifications to manage adverse reactions are 
provided in Table 2 of the SmPC.  
Detailed guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse reactions and infusion-related 
reactions are described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following aspects: 
- there is an unmet medical need for more efficacious treatments in 2nd line of Endometrial cancer 
considering treatments for second line of EC have a limited efficacy, roughly 15% of ORR, with median 
of OS not longer than 1 year.  
- dostarlimab has the potential to address this unmet medical need. Even though the limited sample 
size of the GARNET study cannot be considered robust enough to fully characterise the efficacy and 
safety, the antitumor activity shown by this drug in the specific setting of MSI-H/dMMR 2nd line EC, 
appears durable and is considered promising.  
However, during the assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as major objections were raised and a longer clock stop was requested by the 
applicant.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in

confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab for patients in recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-
H endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-
containing regimen, the Applicant committed to provide the following data: 
− Provision of further data from the ongoing GARNET study Cohort A1 expansion of enrolment. 
They are continuing to enroll patients and as of Aug 30, 2020, 136 patients have been 
enrolled. This study will provide safety and efficacy data and longer follow up period in the 
indicated patient population. A primary analysis of ORR and DOR data is expected for Q4 
2021 (N=131 with ≥ 12 months follow up from the first time of responses) and submission is 
planned for Q4 2022. 
− Provision of data from Study 4010-03-001 (RUBY), a randomised double-blind Phase III study 
of dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin plus paclitaxel considered the 
SOC) versus chemotherapy alone in subjects with recurrent or primary advanced endometrial 
cancer. Patients in the study will be stratified by MSI/MMR status. The study was opened for 
enrolment in July 2019 and is going to enrol 470 subjects. The study as of August 30, 2020 
has 264 randomized patients. This study will provide safety and efficacy data of dostarlimab 
in combination with chemotherapy. The primary analysis of progression-free survival (PFS), 
as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) is foreseen in Q1 2022 (N=470). At 
that time an interim OS analysis is expected to be performed. The subsequent data 
submission is planned for Q4 (December) 2022. The final analysis is foreseen for 2024. 
• 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as results of GARNET study have shown that dostarlimab 
has a proven benefit and will substantially advance medical practice for patients with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC who have progressed on or following a platinum-containing regimen.  
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the lack of approved treatment options and the 
poor prognosis of these patients, new effective treatment options are urgently needed. 
Dostarlimab has demonstrated a favourable benefit risk profile that makes it a potential 
valuable treatment for this patient population with a manageable safety profile. Therefore, 
taking into account the lack of approved treatment options and in light of the available data, 
the applicant is of the opinion that granting the approval in this indication for dostarlimab will 
provide to these patients that are in need a studied therapeutic option, that the benefit to 
public health outweighs the risk as demonstrated by the benefit risk profile of the product, 
while additional data will be generated in order to confirm the safety and efficacy of dostarlimab 
in the pivotal study GARNET and in the Phase III study RUBY.

2.2.  Quality aspects  
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The Jemperli finished product is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 500 mg 
of dostarlimab as active substance.  
Other  ingredients  are:  trisodium  citrate  dihydrate,  citric  acid  monohydrate,  L-arginine  hydrochloride, 
sodium chloride, polysorbate 80, and water for injection. 
The product is available in 10 mL type I borosilicate clear glass vial, with a grey chlorobutyl elastomer 
stopper  laminated  with  fluoropolymer,  sealed  with  an  aluminium  flip-off  cap  containing  500  mg 
dostarlimab.  
Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an enhanced 
approached were applied.  
2.2.2.  Active substance  
General information  
Dostarlimab is an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody, 
produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It is a glycosylated homodimer consisting of two 
identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, with 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds and 4 inter-
chain disulfide bonds. The predominant N-linked glycoforms are core fucosylated biantennary glycans 
with 0 (G0F), 1 (G1F), and 2 (G2F) terminal galactose residues. Lack of dostarlimab ADCC activity has 
been demonstrated by lack of Fcɣ binding (Biacore analysis).   
IgG4 is reported to have the tendency to form half-antibodies. To prevent this, each heavy chain contains 
a serine to proline substitution at amino acid 225, to promote stabilization of disulphide bonds between 
the two heavy chains. 
Dostarlimab is claimed to be a New Active Substance.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
GMP Certificates provided for active substance manufacturing and testing sites are considered 
acceptable in the context of this procedure. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The  dostarlimab  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described.  An  active 
substance batch consists of a pool of harvests from two (2) to three (3) production bioreactors, each 
inoculated  from  a  culture  derived  from  a  single  vial  of  the  working  cell  bank  (WCB).  Dostarlimab  is 
expressed in a CHO cell line using a fed-batch process.  
Main steps are fermentation, recovery and purification. The commercial dostarlimab manufacturing 
process follows a standard process for monoclonal antibodies production, starting with the thawing of 
one vial of the working cell bank, followed by several cell expansion steps before inoculating multiple 
bioreactors. The bioreactors are harvested through centrifugation and depth filtration followed by 
purification using three chromatography unit operations. After that a UF/DF step is performed followed 
by polysorbate addition. Low pH inactivation and virus filtration are included as orthogonal dedicated

virus inactivation/elimination steps. Once the active substance is filtered, it is stored frozen at ≤-35˚C 
prior been shipped to the finished product or active substance storage facilities.  
The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance 
criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described for each step. Critical 
process parameters (CPP), key process parameters (KPP), critical process attributes (CPA) and key 
process attributes (KPA), including their proven acceptable ranges have been provided for the vial 
thaw, seed expansion, production bioreactors, harvest and all the purification steps. Hold studies have 
been performed to allow the storage of process intermediates based on biochemical and microbial 
integrity. Reprocessing is allowed for viral filtration step in case a filter integrity fails, or the process is 
operated outside the validated parameters, and for the bulk fill step, in case the filter integrity fails, or 
active substance container is unsuitable for use. Reprocessing has been evaluated at lab scale and no 
impact on product quality has been observed. A protocol to validate three reprocessing operations at 
commercial scale has been provided. The active substance manufacturing process is considered 
acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials, both compendial and non-compendial, used in the active 
substance manufacturing process has been submitted. Materials are controlled based on a risk 
assessment. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the 
establishment of cell substrate. 
A two tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of MCB 
and WCB and release of future WCBs. The history and characteristics of the host cell bank based on 
commercial CHO DG44 cells are described. The host cell bank was properly characterised. The master 
(MCB) and working (WCB) cell banks were produced under GMP conditions and have been 
characterised for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers. Characterisation tests include identity 
(genetic and morphologic identification), DNA sequencing, integration of recombinant transgenes (copy 
number) and safety (freedom from adventitious agents). An End of Production Cell Bank (EOPCB) was 
generated. Characterisation of EOPCB demonstrates that there are no significant changes in cell line 
stability and viral safety when subjected to extra passaging during production, establishing an in vitro 
cell age limit for the dostarlimab manufacturing process. All tests were done according to current 
guidelines, and the results obtained ensure that both banks meet all required specifications. Genetic 
stability has been demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit of cell age. 
A protocol for generation of future WCBs is provided. It gives high-level information on the cultivation, 
media used and preparation for storage. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the dostarlimab active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information 
has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance 
manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-
process tests. As part of the development of the control strategy, a series of risk assessments have 
been performed on each stage of the process to identify the process parameters that impact the critical 
quality attributes. The acceptable ranges for the process parameters were studied in characterization 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 17/176 
 
 
  
 
 
 
studies. Acceptable ranges for the critical process parameters (CPP) and critical process attributes 
(CPA) have been provided based on results of the process characterization studies.  
Process validation 
The dostarlimab active substance manufacturing process has been validated. The approach taken to 
validate dostarlimab manufacturing process is based on an enhanced approach, where the process is 
demonstrated to perform consistently and dostarlimab meets all the biochemical, functional and 
microbiological acceptance criteria.  
Four active substance batches were successfully processed through upstream process and three 
consecutive batches were fully executed through the downstream process and were successfully 
processed to active substance. One batch was terminated due to a non-process related contamination 
in the harvest tank (root cause established). Thus, consistency in production has been shown on three 
consecutive full-scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces dostarlimab active substance of reproducible quality that 
complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
The dostarlimab active substance process has adequately demonstrated the removal of process related 
impurities (e.g. host cell proteins (HCP), host cell DNA, media components) at acceptably low levels. 
Additional impurities risk assessments and spiking studies have been provided. 
Concurrent at scale validation protocols have been provided for chromatography resin lifetimes, UF/DF 
membranes lifetimes and reprocessing for viral filtration and final filtration prior bulk fill. Small scale 
resin lifetime studies and reprocessing studies have been included. Ongoing process verification will be 
used to monitor the validated commercial dostarlimab manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Several significant changes have been introduced during the development of 
the manufacturing process, including a change from MCB to WCB in the upstream process, process 
upscale, process transfer to different facilities and process condition changes to accommodate the 
larger manufacturing scale, to improve process yields, and to improve impurity removal capabilities in 
the purification process. To support those changes an analytical comparability assessment was 
performed according to guidelines ICH Q5E and ICH Q9, which included comparison of impurity 
removal, batch analysis data, extended characterization comprising physicochemical tests (e.g. 
primary sequence analysis, high order structure analysis, glycosylation and sialylation analysis, and 
stability studies. The results of these studies show that there are no differences in product quality 
attributes between the clinical development process (single bioreactor) and commercial process.  
The development of the control strategy for dostarlimab has been well described. Initially product 
critical quality attributes (CQA) were identified and failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) risk assessment 
was performed to select process parameters and raw materials for process characterization (PC) 
experimental studies. Prior to starting the PC studies small scale models were developed and qualified 
by adjusting the scale dependent parameters and were used in process characterization studies to 
establish the proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for the different units of operation. As part of the 
control strategy an extractable and leachable risk assessment was performed. Based on extractable 
analysis, threshold of toxicological concerns and permissible daily exposure calculations it was 
concluded that the risks to patients are low. Overall, the systematic approach taken to develop the 
control strategy is considered adequate. In-process controls includes what are defined as key- and 
critical process parameters. A key process parameter (KPP) does not have a meaningful impact on 
CQAs in the defined range’. A key performance attribute (KPA) should be monitored to assess whether 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 18/176 
 
 
  
 
 
the process performs predictably and acceptably. The definition of CQA, CPP, KPP, CPA, KPA and 
proven acceptable ranges is sound and the proposed control strategy for the manufacture of 
dostarlimab intermediate is endorsed. 
Characterisation 
The dostarlimab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by a wide range of analytical 
methodologies classified into five categories: structural characterization, physicochemical properties, 
heterogeneity analysis, bioactivity and degradation products and pathway. Furthermore, heterogeneity 
of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size and charge variants, 
glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. The bioactivity and binding 
properties of dostarlimab were assessed using various analytical methods. These studies showed that 
dostarlimab blocks the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 
programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Even though, the Applicant also stated that dostarlimab 
blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), no 
information has been presented in support of this statement. 
Process-related impurities were assessed based on their potential risk to safety, efficacy, 
immunogenicity and overall effect on the quality of dostarlimab active substance.  
Product-related impurities have also been characterised, including size variants as aggregates and 
fragments whose risk as impurity is high, and charge variants as oxidized and isomerized species 
whose risk as impurity is low. In addition, product-related substances have been characterised, 
including sialylated glycan species, deamidated species and C-terminal lysine on the heavy chain. 
In conclusion, the proposed overall product characterisation strategy is appropriate. 
Specification  
The specification set for release and stability of dostarlimab active substance have been set in 
accordance with ICH Q6B and includes suitable physicochemical tests and appropriate tests for 
identity, purity and potency to control relevant characteristics of monoclonal antibodies. 
Overall, the acceptance criteria for the specification are based on active substance batch analyses and 
considered sufficiently justified. During the evaluation procedure, the adjustment of some active 
substance specifications (e.g. charged variants, residual protein A content (REC)) was requested to 
align them with amended specifications for finished product or to better reflect process capability and 
clinical experience. The data presented show that the active substance is highly pure and of consistent 
potency.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. System suitability criteria and sample acceptance criteria 
are specified were relevant and the system suitability test ranges have been confirmed during 
validation of the methods. The system suitability criteria are adequate to confirm that the methods are 
in control during routine testing. 
Batch analysis 
Batch release data are provided for dostarlimab manufactured for clinical and commercial finished 
product manufacturing.  
Data for all active substance batches presented, show that data is comparable across production scales 
and are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Assessment report

Reference materials 
A dostarlimab reference material program has been established that consists of a two-tiered reference 
material system, consistent with ICH Q6B guidance. The primary and working reference materials were 
derived from the same dostarlimab active substance at the same time. Future working reference 
materials will be qualified against the PRM and a protocol has been provided. Overall, the reference 
standard program is deemed acceptable. 
Container closure 
The container is a polycarbonate bottle. The closure consists of a polypropylene screw cap with a 
silicone liner. Appropriate validation for extractables and leachables was performed for the container 
closure system. Prior to use, the containers are released in accordance with established site 
procedures. Vendor specifications are described. 
Stability  
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
maximum storage time in the proposed container, i.e. 36 months when stored at ≤-35°C.  
Data from primary stability studies and supporting stability studies are available. Stability test results 
meet the commercial acceptance criteria at long-term storage conditions for all primary and supporting 
stability lots. The stability studies have been performed according to ICH Q5C. 
The analytical methods used in the stability program are a subset of the validated methods used for 
release of the active substance for further manufacturing into finished product. These include either 
dostarlimab-specific analytical methods that were shown to be stability indicating through forced 
degradation studies or compendial tests suitable for monitoring general characteristics of the product 
throughout its shelf life. 
Accelerated and stressed stability data generated at 5±30°C and 25°C/60% RH is provided for up to 6 
months.  
Photostability studies, forced degradation studies, and freeze-thaw studies have been performed 
according to relevant guidelines.  
The applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies post-approval and to annually add at 
least one commercial active substance batch to the stability program.  
In summary, the stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the 
proposed maximum storage time of 36 months at <-35oC in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product  
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development  
The Jemperli 50 mg/mL finished product is a sterile clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to yellow 
solution, essentially free from visible particles, and supplied as 10 mL single-use glass vial with a 
stopper and aluminium seal. Each finished product vial contains 500 mg dostarlimab formulated with 
trisodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, L-arginine hydrochloride, sodium chloride, and 
polysorbate-80. 
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) as described by the ICH Guideline Q8 (R2) was defined to 
ensure that the safety and efficacy of Jemperli could be maintained as described in the Target Product 
Profile (TPP). The QTPP for the finished product was refined over time and was used to guide the 
product development effort to satisfy clinical and commercial requirements. 
Formulation studies were designed to optimise the chemical and physical stability of dostarlimab. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. Neither excipients of human or animal origin, or novel excipients are used in the 
manufacture of the finished product. 
An overfill of 0.7 mL is included to allow proper volume withdrawal (10 mL) but no overage. 
The primary packaging is a 10 mL type I borosilicate clear glass vial, with a grey chlorobutyl elastomer 
stopper laminated with fluoropolymer, sealed with an aluminium flip-off cap containing 500 mg 
dostarlimab. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EU requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
The development of finished product manufacturing process started with the early phase clinical 
presentation, manufactured at WuXi Biologics (WuXi) in China. For the late phase clinical trials and 
commercial presentation, a higher protein content per vial was targeted (50 mg/mL dostarlimab, with 
10.0 mL delivered volume), with no change in product formulation. In addition, the stored conditions 
were changed from -40ºC to -80ºC. The comparability of the two storage conditions was demonstrated 
by stability studies. 
A bioanalytical comparability assessment was performed between early and late presentations. The 
comparability exercise was based on product release, complementary biophysical characterisation and 
stability studies. Results from these studies demonstrate that the process changes did not adversely 
impact the quality and safety of the finished product. 
The finished product packaging materials and manufacturing process components were evaluated for 
potential extractables, elemental impurities and leachables using a risk-based approach. 
The finished product is a sterile concentrate for solution for infusion and contains no antimicrobial 
preservatives. Sterility is assured by a validated process. In-use compatibility was demonstrated by 
evaluating the stability of the finished product with IV bag materials and diluents. The data from the 
compatibility study supports that the finished product is biochemically stable. The microbial growth 
potential of the finished product was evaluated when diluted, following Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 
recommendations. No significant microbial growth was detected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021

The critical quality attributes identified were visible particles, sub-visible particles, extractable volume 
and sterility and are properly controlled during the finished product manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The sites involved in manufacturing, in-process testing, testing, labelling and packaging, final batch 
release and importation are listed in the dossier and are all supported by a valid proof of GMP 
compliance.  GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services, Ltd., Ireland is responsible for final batch release.  
The batch formula for Jemperli 50 mg/mL finished product is provided, as well as a batch size range. 
This range was properly validated during PPQ. 
The finished product manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail and includes thawing, 
pooling and mixing of the active substance, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration, and aseptic 
filling into the unlabelled primary container. No formulation or dilution steps are included.  
 The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate. 
The process does not include any isolated process intermediates. Reprocessing is not allowed. 
All vials and vial components, as well as filling machine parts and other product-contact components, 
are properly prepared and sterilised. The whole process is carried out in qualified facilities, 
appropriately monitored, using qualified equipment. Key and critical process parameters and 
performance attributes for every individual process step are properly defined and described. 
Process performance qualification (PPQ) of Jemperli finished product was performed with a minimum of 
three PPQ finished product batches for the common part (BDS thawing, pooling and mixing, and 
bioburden reduction filtration) and for each filling line and covers the proposed batch size range. 
Performance consistency was properly demonstrated across filling lines and intra-filling line. The 
acceptance range for the process parameters were defined according to process control strategy. All 
acceptance criteria for CPPs, CPAs, KPPs, KPAs, and finished product release criteria were met for all 
PPQ batches for both filling lines. Some deviations were reported, investigated, and concluded that 
they have no impact in the process validation.  
The validated finished product manufacturing process will be continually monitored. 
Bioburden reduction and sterile filtration were properly validated by small-scale filter validation 
studies. Container closure integrity was demonstrated by a validated headspace gas analysis. Aseptic 
processing validation of each filling line was performed with three consecutive media fill simulations. In 
addition, appropriate shipping validation studies were performed for worst-case routes, under 
temperature-controlled conditions, and exposure stresses of shock, vibration, and pressure changes.  
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) for a new finished product manufacturing site 
intended to be implemented is provided. 
Product specification  
The release and end-of-shelf specifications of the finished product have been provided and cover all 
the required attributes, including tests for appearance, content, identity, purity, potency and general 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 22/176 
 
 
  
 
 
compendial tests. The dostarlimab finished product release and shelf-life specifications are considered 
adequate to ensure the quality of Jemperli finished product. 
The majority of methods are used to control both the active substance and finished product, except for 
quality attributes normally expected for control of finished product (e.g. general pharmaceutical 
attributes) or active substance (e.g. process related impurities). 
The acceptance criteria for finished product specifications were established following accumulated 
knowledge about the product and a statistical analysis (TI) based on the finished product batches. The 
TI 95/99 were applied as predictive of future values and used to confirm the ability of future batches to 
meet the acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria were also confirmed against data from the 
stability studies at the long-term condition. The acceptance criteria for impurities are supported by an 
assessment of all release (reflective of clinical experience) and stability data. Overall, the approach for 
setting the specification is acceptable and in line with ICH Q6B.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The compendial analytical procedures are 
verified and are performed according to current Ph. Eur. Monographs. 
The validation studies and transfer qualification information presented are considered acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
Batch information is provided in the dossier, including the status, manufacturing date, batch size, 
reference standard used for release testing, active substance manufacturing process, description, 
manufacturing site, disposition in clinic, PPQ, and stability studies. Batch analysis results of batches of 
50 mg/ml dostarlimab finished product are presented in the dossier. Batch analysis data of historical 
dostarlimab finished product batches have also been provided. The results are within the specifications 
and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
Reference standards are identical to the reference standards for the active substance. 
Stability of the product  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months when stored at 2 – 8 °C in the original 
package in order to protect from light, as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. Short-term excursions 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 23/176 
 
 
  
 
 
outside the storage condition are not anticipated to affect the product quality as evidenced by the real-
time data obtained at the accelerated and stressed conditions. 
The stability of Jemperli 50 mg/mL finished product is evaluated by a stability program in accordance 
with ICH Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products and ICH Q5C Stability 
Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products. The batches of Jemperli are representative to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The stability of the finished product is primarily supported by stability studies conducted on clinical 
finished product with the same components, process and facility as the commercial finished product. 
Real time/real condition stability data and for accelerated conditions at 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH and  at 
40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
All batches placed at the long-term stability condition (5 ± 3°C) remained within specifications for all 
timepoints tested to date. No discernible trends or change in any of the tested product quality 
attributes were observed for up to 36 months from one finished product batch, from other batches on 
stability including two batches with 24 months of data and four additional batches with 18 months of 
data, where all batches exhibited the same stability characteristics for the timepoints tested. 
A photostability study with vials from a selected batch to identify potential sensitivity to light exposure. 
Results from the photo-stability study confirm that the finished product is not sensitive to light 
exposure and the data supports the extended stability of finished product to light exposure at room 
temperature for up to 30 days. 
The applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies post-approval and to annually add at 
least one commercial finished product batch to the stability program.  
Post approval change management protocol(s)  
The post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) presented in the dossier outlines the 
comparability plan for the addition and implementation of an alternate commercial site for the 
production of Jemperli 50 mg/mL finished product. The alternate site will be added post-approval as an 
additional site of manufacture, primary packaging, inspection, secondary packaging and labelling, 
storage, and batch release testing of finished product to expand manufacturing capacity and mitigate 
supply continuity risk. The finished product may in future be sourced from both the finished product 
sites upon approval of the post-approval variation. 
An ongoing process verification approach that integrates process development and process 
validation/qualification will be included into an overall program aimed at increasing the level of process 
knowledge and understanding, to ensure that the process is operated under a state of control. The 
potential differences between the manufacturing process as run at the current finished product site and 
the process at the alternate site are minimal. 
The alternate site will execute batches at commercial scale, after technology transfer of the process to 
the site. Comparability studies will be performed. The product quality assessment will consist of the 
release testing results, higher order characterization analysis, and stability study data from the PPQ 
batches. Overall, the provided information on the PACMP presented is considered sufficient. 
Adventitious agents  
A comprehensive strategy has been used to ensure the Jemperli 50 mg/mL finished is free from 
adventitious agents (non-viral and viral adventitious agents). This includes cell bank characterization,

raw material sourcing and testing, production facility controls, manufacturing process monitoring and 
control, and viral clearance validation studies. 
No animal-derived raw materials or resins are used for the manufacture of Jemperli, except for the 
recombinant CHO production cell line. Based on the information provided, the Jemperli product is 
considered safe in terms of non-viral adventitious agents. 
Extensive viral safety testing was performed on the MCB, WCB and EOPCB (end of production cells) 
according to ICH guideline Q5A (R1) and EMA guideline EMEA/CHMP/BWP/398498/2005. The results 
confirm that no infectious endogenous or adventitious viral agents were detected in the MCB or WCB. 
Unprocessed bulk samples were also tested, and no viral agents were detected.  
Viral clearance studies were performed to determine the capacity of the dostarlimab active substance 
manufacturing process to remove or inactivate potential endogenous and adventitious viruses. The 
manufacturing process for Jemperli includes steps specifically designed to remove viruses (virus 
filtration) and inactivate viruses (low pH viral inactivation) and additionally the chromatography steps 
contribute to the overall virus clearance. For the Virus filtration step, effective virus removal was 
demonstrated for all types of viruses tested.  
The sponsor is committed to re-evaluating the risk to viral safety as part of a process comparability 
package when significant changes in the active substance production process (either cell culture or 
downstream purification) are made, as needed.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects  
The Quality documentation in the Jemperli dossier is of acceptable standard. Whilst no Quality Major 
Objections were raised, the applicant was requested to address a number of Other 
Concerns/clarifications, which have been successfully resolved during the procedure.  
Satisfactory information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product will 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The active substance and finished product manufacturing process and process controls are described in 
sufficient detail and the processes are appropriately validated. A science- and risk-based approach with 
Quality by Design (QbD) elements was used for process development and process characterization, 
supporting the proposed manufacturing process and its control strategy as well as demonstrating a 
solid process understanding. Comparability was demonstrated for material from early development into 
the commercial active substance process. Characterization of dostarlimab active substance was 
performed using an extensive panel of appropriate methods.  
Overall, the approach for setting the product specifications is acceptable and in line with ICH Q6B. 
However, the approach used for setting the charge variant specification is not fully agreed. Method 
variability has been accounted for in setting the specification acceptance limits, although it is already 
taken into account in the batch data and this results in wide ranges. Despite this, the proposed 
specification has been accepted as it is not expected to have an impact on product safety/efficacy.

A risk assessment for the formation of nitrosamines have been provided and the applicant concludes 
that there is no risk of formation of N-nitrosamines taking into consideration the manufacturing 
process and the container closure system.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. This pertains to the re-assessment of the specifications for 
residual protein A and host cell protein upon completion of the on-going at scale column resin re-use 
carryover study. This point is put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to consistent clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been 
presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  To reassess the residual protein A and host cell protein specification criterion upon completion of 
the on-going at scale column resin re-use carryover study.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction  
The non-clinical efficacy and safety of dostarlimab (also referred as APE04443.03 or TSR-042) were 
characterised through a battery of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies.  
The mechanism of action for dostarlimab was evaluated in a series of in vitro binding studies using 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and flow cytometry to assess the binding kinetics of dostarlimab to 
human and cynomolgus monkey PD-1 and the ability of dostarlimab to block PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-1/PD-
L2 interactions in a competitive setting.  
The Pharmacokinetic (Toxicokinetics) characterisation of dostarlimab was carried out through toxicity 
studies with cynomolgus monkey, no specific pharmacokinetics studies were carried out.  
The toxicology of dostarlimab was evaluated through a single dose toxicity study and repeated dose 
toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey.  
Studies conducted as part of the toxicology program, with the exception of the single-dose study in 
monkeys and the initial tissue cross-reactivity study in normal human tissues, were conducted in 
compliance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Principles of Good 
Laboratory Practice (as revised in 1997), ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamic activity of dostarlimab was conducted in both in vitro and in vivo experimental 
systems. 
In vitro 
In vitro characterization: binding to human PD-1 and competitive blocking of PD-1 interaction with PD-
L1 and PD-L2  
TSR-042 (dostarlimab) was characterized for binding kinetics to human PD-1 using SPR (Report 
ANA011.003). The results of the three experiments showed that TSR-042 demonstrated a KD of 2-4 
nM for binding to monomeric soluble human PD-1 (Study ANA011.003). Dostarlimab Binding to PD-1 
Dimeric Fusion Protein showed KD = 0.3 nM; Ka = 5.7x105/Ms and Kd = 1.7x10-4/s (surface plasma 
resonance). Under the CHO cell Surface PD-1 system, the EC50 = 2 nM (Study report ANA011.002). 
Blocking of the PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-1/PD-L2 binding interaction was assessed by flow cytometry that 
measured DyLight 650 (DyL650)-labeled PD-L1 or PD-L2 mouse IgG1 Fc fusion protein (PD-L1mFc/PD-
L2 mFc) binding to human PD-1-expressing CHO-K1 cells (Study ANA011.002). Compared to an IgG4 
isotype control, dostarlimab efficiently blocked PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-1/PD-L2 binding, with IC50 values 
of 1.8 and 1.5 nM, respectively (Figure 1).

In vitro characterisation of dostarlimab in mixed lymphocyte reaction  
Functional antagonist activity of dostarlimab was tested in a human CD4+ T cell mixed lymphocyte 
reaction (MLR) assay. An isotype control antibody was tested in parallel and the results were compared 
with historical MLR assay results for APE04443.01 (another lot of TSR-042), APE02479 (another lot of 
TSR-042), and BMS-936558 (nivolumab) (Report ANA011.003) (see Table 3). For determination of 
functional potency of TSR-042 (APE04443.03) the EC50 was measured in 3 separate MLR experiments 
using different human donors. Antagonism of PD-1 in this assay has been shown to result in increased 
T cell activation as measured by increased IL-2 production.  
The EC50 value for dostarlimab was approximately 1nM (ranged from 0.13 to 2 nM).

Dostarlimab binding to human/ cynomolgus monkey PBMCs  
The  studies  XLB-071  and  074X  reported  the  concentration  range  of  dostarlimab  (TSR-042)  which 
effectively  binds  to  human/cyno  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs)  (3  donors).  This  was 
determined by flow cytometry utilising a CD3 marker and an IgG4 specific antibody.  
Figure 3. % Pd-1 occupancy for TSR-042 to human (left) or monkey (right) PBMCs  
Cross-species binding specificity of dostarlimab 
When binding kinetics to the human and cynomolgus monkey PD-1 dimer were evaluated, there was 
less than a 2-fold difference in the KD values (0.1-0.3 nM for the human PD-1 dimer as compared to 
0.2-0.5 nM for the cynomolgus monkey PD-1 dimer (Table 2). In addition, binding of dostarlimab to 
human or cynomolgus monkey PD-1, expressed on CHO-K1 cells, was assessed by flow cytometry 
using phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG4 to detect antibody binding (Study 
ANA011.002). Dostarlimab bound to cell surface human and cynomolgus monkey PD-1 with an EC50 of 
2.0 and 3.4 nM, respectively.

Table 4. Dostarlimab Binding to PD-1 Dimeric Fusion Protein (SPR) and Cell Surface PD-1 
(Flow Cytometry)  
The objective of the study XLB-065 was to assess TSR-042 binding to freshly isolated peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the following: cynomolgous {cyno}, human, beagle, mouse and rat 
PBMCs. This was determined by flow cytometry utilizing TSR-042 conjugated to the fluorophore FITC 
over a range of concentrations. 
For freshly isolated PBMCs stained with FITC-TSR-042 higher staining was observed with cyno PBMCs 
and human PBMCs. Lower levels of staining were observed with beagle PBMC and very low levels with 
both mouse and rat PBMCs (Table 5 and Table 6).

Due to the lack of cross-reactivity between anti-human PD-1 antibodies like dostarlimab and mouse 
PD-1, a commercially available rat anti-mouse surrogate antibody (APE04348) was used to assess the 
potential for PD-1 inhibition to suppress tumour growth in an MC38 syngeneic mouse tumour model 
(Study ANA011.E004). Other treatments as well as control negative were used for comparison. 
The MC38 cell line was derived from a mouse colon adenocarcinoma. Tumours were initiated by 
subcutaneously implanting 1×106 MC38 cells into the right flank of each animal, and tumour 
development was monitored. Mice with tumours measuring 32 to 75 mm3 were randomized and dosed 
with antibody (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) intraperitoneally twice weekly (on Days

1, 4, 8, and 11). Tumours were measured twice a week for up to 60 days (end of study). The time-to-
endpoint (TTE) for each mouse was defined as the time when the tumour reached a volume of 
2,000 mm3 and the animal was euthanized or on the final day (Day 60), whichever came first. MC38 
tumours in vehicle control-treated mice exhibited progressive growth, reaching the 2,000 mm3 volume 
endpoint at a median of 33.8 days. Anti-mouse-PD-1 suppressed tumour growth. Seven of 10 animals 
were tumour free after at least 60 days (Figure 4), extending the survival (median TTE 60 days versus 
33.8 days in vehicle-treated animals) and resulting in a 78% tumour growth delay, calculated as 
percent increase in median TTE for treated versus control mice. No treatment-related toxicity or loss of 
body weight was observed in anti-PD-1-treated animals.

Tumour-Bearing Mice  
The tumour growth inhibition seen in the anti-PD-1 treatment arm translated into extended long-term 
survival for these groups (Figure 5A). To confirm that anti-tumour efficacy was mediated by an 
adaptive immune response, 6 animals from the anti-PD-1 group that were tumour free on Day 81 were 
re-challenged with 4 times the number of MC38 tumour cells used for the original inoculation (4×10
6 
MC38 cells per animal; opposite [left] flank). On the same day, 9 age-matched, female, treatment-
naïve mice were inoculated with 4×10
MC38 cells per animal. All animals were treated with vehicle,

and tumours were measured twice weekly for an additional 7 weeks. All 9 (100%) of the treatment-
naïve control animals developed tumours and reached the 2,000 mm3 endpoint at a median of 36.9 
days (Study ANA001.E005). All animals previously treated with anti-PD-1 and re-challenged with MC38 
cells had palpable tumours at 2 to 3 weeks post re-challenge, but by the fourth to fifth week post 
MC38 cell re-challenge, all animals were again tumour free and remained tumour free until the end of 
the study (Figure 5B).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro stimulation of PBMCs/cytokine production 
An  evaluation  on  whether  the  compound  dostarlimab  (TSR-042)  would  cause  stimulation  of  human 
PBMCs -as determined by levels of Interferon-γ and IL-2 expression-, and the effect on cytokine release 
was conducted in vitro. 
PBMCs from 3 donors were adjusted to a final concentration of 200,000 cells/well and incubated with 
either TSR-042, or IgG4 at the various concentrations (for 3 days at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator). 
As a positive control either CytoStim (1 uL/well) or CD2/CD3/CD28 beads (4 uL/well) was added to the 
appropriate wells. IL-2 expression levels or IFN-γ was determined in one aliquot by ELISA. Other aliquots 
were submitted for multiplex analysis (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-̵α). 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 32/176 
 
 
  
 
 
 
For all donors, low levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 was obtained with all concentrations of TSR-042 (5-2000 
µg/mL)  and  IgG4  evaluated  (the  same  concentration  as  TSR-042),  while  high  levels  of  IFN-γ  was 
obtained with CytoStim and CD2/CD3/CD28 beads (0.02%). Only with the CD2/CD3/CD28 beads were 
significant levels of IL-2 expression obtained. 
Treatment of PBMCs with either TSR-042 or IgG4 alone generated no enhanced cytokine response or 
any clear dose response. Only treatment of the PBMCs with CD2/CD3/CD28 beads generated elevated 
levels of expression the various cytokines evaluated. 
In  conclusion,  TSR-042  caused  minimal  stimulation  of  PBMCs/cytokine  release  at  the  evaluated 
concentrations. 
Binding of dostarlimab to complement component C1q 
Dostarlimab binding to complement component C1q was assessed in study 8324-037. A C1q ELISA was 
developed based on the method described by Idusogie et al., 2000. The target article was coated onto 
a  96-well  polystyrene  plate  at  8  concentrations:  10,  7.7,  5.9,  4.6,  3.5,  2.7,  2.1,  and  1.6  µg/mL.  
MabThera served as positive control. The EC50 values and 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated 
for each test article.  
Luminance increased with the positive control MabThera, however, no reaction occurred with the TSR-
042 (Figure 6).

Binding of dostarlimab to FcγR1 (CD64)  
Study  No.  8324-038  assessed  dostarlimab  binding  to  FcyRI.  A  Bio-Layer  Interferometry  (BLI)-based 
(Forte Bio Octet Red 96) method for determining binding rate constants (kon, koff, KD) was successfully 
developed  and  optimised  to  provide  kinetic  data  on  the  interaction  between  provided  monoclonal 
antibodies, and Human CD64 Protein. MabThera served as positive control.

The TSR-042 average KD was 16.42 nM (2SD range of 12.31 to 20.52 nM) from n=3. MabThera KD = 
6.94 nM (4.82 to 9.06 nM). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Dostarlimab safety pharmacology was assessed within toxicity studies in Cynomolgus Monkeys (Study 
273-0016-TX). Three groups of 3 female and 3 male monkeys each received a single administration of 
dostarlimab at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg dissolved in Phosphorous buffer saline (PBS, pH7.4). The control 
animals (3 females and 3 males) received PBS only. Electrocardiograms were obtained from all 
available animals. ECG data analysis included a description of waveform morphology (for P, QRS, and T 
waves), but measurements of interval durations (RR, PR, QRS, and QT) and QTc interval duration was 
not calculated in this study. There were no dostarlimab related effects on electrocardiography following 
a single intravenous administration of dostarlimab at dose levels up to 100 mg/kg. No dostarlimab 
systemic adverse effects (clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmologic examinations) 
were noted in the study. 
Safety pharmacology parameters (cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems) were also 
evaluated in a pivotal GLP toxicity study with monkeys (Study No. 273-022-TX). No treatment-related 
effects on both quantitative and qualitative ECG parameters, blood pressure parameters, heart rate were 
observed  in  this  study.  No  delayed  effects  were  noted  in  recovery  phase.  There  were  no  treatment-
related  effects  on  respiratory  and  neurological  parameters  observed  in  this  study.  The  no  observed 
adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be ≥100 mg/kg/dose, based on the lack of test article-
related changes for both male and females. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic (toxicokinetics) characterisation of dostarlimab was carried out through toxicity 
studies with cynomolgus monkey. Dostarlimab was administered intravenously and toxicokinetic 
parameters were assessed after both single and repeated administration to cynomolgus monkeys. An 
ELISA method was developed for measuring dostarlimab and anti-dostarlimab antibodies in monkey 
serum. 
No distribution, metabolism, excretion studies were submitted.  
Absorption  
Cynomolgus Monkeys toxicokinetics was firstly addressed through a single intravenous infusion non-GLP 
study (Study 273-0016-TX). In this study, three groups of 3 female and 3 male monkeys each received 
a single administration of dostarlimab at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg dissolved in Phosphorous buffer saline 
(PBS,  pH7.4).  The  control  animals  (3  females  and  3  males)  received  PBS  only.  No  significant  sex 
differences in systemic exposure were observed at any dose level. Combined toxicokinetic parameters 
from male and female monkeys are presented in the Table 7 and Table 8.

Cynomolgus Monkeys (Male and Female Combined)  
Toxicokinetics parameters were also assessed within a GLP toxicity study with cynomolgus monkey 
(study no. 273-0022-TX, GLP study). Animals were administered 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/dose TSR-
042 once every week for 4 weeks (five doses in total) by 15-minute intravenous infusion. 
No significant sex differences in systemic exposure were observed at any dose level, therefore combined 
toxicokinetic parameters from male and female monkeys are presented in the Table 9. 
Table 9: Summary of Toxicokinetic Parameters in Male and Female Monkeys Following 
Intravenous Administration of TSR-042 once weakly for 4 weeks  
The systemic exposure increased dose-proportionally in both sexes on Days 1 and 22 as the dosage 
increased from 10 to 100 mg/kg. 
The potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of TSR-042, when given intravenously once weekly for 13 weeks 
(a total of 14 doses) to cynomolgus monkeys, and to evaluate the potential reversibility of any findings 
were  determined  in  the  study  report  No.  4010-09-003.  In  males  and  females  across  all  dose  levels 
tested, Tmax ranged from 5 minutes post-dose to 168 hr post-dose on Day 1 and ranged from 5 minutes 
post-dose to 96 hr post-dose on Day 85. By Day 85, steady state serum dostarlimab concentration was 
achieved in males and females in all dose levels tested. Half-life (t1/2), volume of distribution (Vd) and 
clearance  (CL)  could  not  be  estimated  in  any  dose  levels  tested  on  Days  1  and  85  because  of  the

sustained serum dostarlimab concentration within the dosing interval. Exposure of dostarlimab as defined 
by AUC(0-168) increased in a roughly dose-proportional manner in males and females across all dose 
levels tested on Days 1 and 85. 
AUC(0-168) increased in males and females on Day 85 relative to Day 1 in all dose groups, suggesting 
TSR-042 accumulation following repeated weekly dosing. Mean accumulation ratios for AUC(0-168) 
ranged from 2.22 to 3.62 in males and females across all dose groups. No relevant gender difference 
was observed in TSR-042 exposure, as defined by AUC(0-168), across all dose levels tested and 
gender ratios (male/female) ranged from 0.660 to 1.47.

2.3.4.  Toxicology  
Single dose toxicity 
A non-GLP study for the evaluation of toxicokinetics, immunogenicity and potential toxicity (Study 273-
0016-TX) was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys following single intravenous infusion. 
Three groups of 3 female and 3 male monkeys each received a single administration of Dostarlimab. 
The control animals (3 females and 3 males) received PBS only. 
Evaluation included mortality, clinical observations (detailed and cage side), body weights, food 
consumption during the in-life phase, ophthalmologic examination at the last week of in life (Week 8), 
clinical pathology evaluations (haematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalysis) on Days 15, 29, 
and 57, electrocardiography examinations on Day 1 and Day 54, and toxicokinetics (TK) of Dostarlimab 
at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5 (30 minutes), 1, 4, 24, 48, 96, 168, 240, 336, 504, 672, 1008, and 1320 hours 
post-dose in serum and anti-TSR-042 antibodies concentration in serum at pre-dose, on Days 15, 29, 
42, and 56. 
Immunogenicity results are presented under “antigenicity”.

There were no TSR-042 related effects on clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmologic examinations or electrocardiography following a single intravenous administration of 
TSR-042 at dose levels up to 100 mg/kg. 
One male was found dead after completion of the Ophthalmologic Examinations during pretest and was 
subsequently replaced. The death of this monkey was not test article-related. 
There were no TSR-042 effects on haematology, clinical biochemistry, or urinalysis that were related to 
a single intravenous administration of TSR-042 at dose levels up to 100 mg/kg. 
When compared with the pretest data on Day 15, decreased haematocrit, increased Reticulocytes 
count, decreased White Blood Cells, including Neutrophils count were noted in all groups including 
control, this was considered to be caused by blood sampling, and not test article-related. 
The administration of TSR-042 by a single intravenous dose to the cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels 
of 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg did not result in any treatment-related adverse effects on clinical signs, 
body weight, food consumption, electrocardiography, ophthalmology, or clinical pathology. The no-
adverse effect-level (NOAEL) was considered to be 100 mg/kg in this study. At NOAEL, the Cmax and 
the AUC0-1320h were 3400μg/mL and 426000 h*μg/mL for males, respectively, and 2930 μg/mL and 
437000 h*μg/mL for females, respectively. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study no. 273-0022-TX 
A GLP repeat dose toxicity, toxicokinetics and safety pharmacology study were conducted in the 
cynomolgus monkey. The study consisted in 4-week repeated intermittent intravenous infusion with 4-
week recovery (study no. 273-0022-TX, GLP study). 
Forty-eight (48) adult cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned to 4 groups, 6/sex/group. 
Animals were administered 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/dose TSR-042 once every week for 4 weeks (five 
doses in total) by 15-minute intravenous infusion.  
Four animals/sex/group were subjected to a full gross necropsy on Day 30, 1 day post the last dose 
(the 5th dose). The remaining 2 animals/sex/group were assigned for a 4 weeks treatment-free 
recovery period and were subjected to a full gross necropsy on Study Day 58 (end of recovery phase). 
Parameters evaluated during the study included mortality, clinical observations including body weights, 
body weight changes, food evaluation, ophthalmologic examinations, neurological examinations, 
electrocardiography, blood pressure and respiration, clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis), toxicokinetics, and anti-drug-antibody (ADA) analysis, gross pathology, organ 
weights, and histopathology. 
Actual concentration and homogeneity of the formulations met the acceptance criteria (100-104%).  
Immunogenicity results are presented under “antigenicity”. 
There were no test article-related mortality, clinical signs, effects on body weight or appetite, or 
findings in ophthalmologic examinations, safety pharmacology parameters (neurological examinations, 
electrocardiography, blood pressure, and respiration), haematology, clinical pathology, urinalysis, 
gross pathology, histopathology, bone marrow smears, and organ weights during the dosing phase or 
recovery phase.

At the injection site, minimal to mild haemorrhage, neutrophilic infiltrates, lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, 
fibrosis, and/or necrosis were observed across all dose groups and were considered to be related to the 
infusion procedure. 
Study No. 4010-09-003 
A GLP repeat dose toxicity, toxicokinetics and safety pharmacology study were conducted in the 
cynomolgus monkey. The study consisted in 13-Week Once Weekly Intravenous Toxicity Study in 
Cynomolgus Monkeys with an 8-Week Recovery Period (GLP). 
The objective of this study was to determine the potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of TSR-042, when 
given intravenously once weekly for 13 weeks (a total of 14 doses) to cynomolgus monkeys and to 
evaluate the potential reversibility of any findings. 
TSR-042 was administered intravenously to cynomolgus monkey (N= 4/sex/dose) once a week for 13 
weeks, at doses of 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg. Control and the highest dose had 6 animals/sex/dose, 
and after the dosing period, 2 animals/sex/dose continued free of TSR-042 for an 8-week recovery 
period.  
The following parameters and endpoints were evaluated in this study: clinical signs, body weights, 
body weight gain, food evaluation, ophthalmology, electrocardiogram, body temperature, blood 
pressure and heart rate, clinical pathology parameters (haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, 
and urinalysis), bioanalysis, toxicokinetic, anti-therapeutic antibody, immunophenotyping, and T-cell 
dependent antibody response (TDAR), plasma cytokine, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and 
histopathologic examinations. 
One male dosed at 10 mg/kg/week was euthanized on Day 89 due to chronic, unresolved generalized 
skin findings and secondary swollen and firm inguinal lymph nodes. Gross findings included generalized 
pale tan scaling of the skin and dark black thickening of the ears (pinna) and enlargement of inguinal 
and axillary lymph nodes. Microscopic findings noted in the skin of this animal included moderate 
mononuclear cell inflammation, acanthosis, single cell keratinocyte death/apoptosis throughout all 
epidermal layers, hyperkeratosis, superficial dermal oedema, spongiosis, intraepithelial lymphocyte 
infiltrates, increased pigmentation, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, and deposition of basophilic 
extracellular matrix in the superficial dermis. Additional microscopic findings noted in this animal 
included mildly to moderately increased lymphoid cellularity in the axillary, mandibular, and inguinal 
lymph nodes and minimally increased cellularity in the spleen. These changes were considered 
secondary to the dermal findings.  
All remaining animals survived to their scheduled necropsy.  
Liquid faeces was considered a possible TSR-042-related effect at ≥ 30 mg/kg/week given the 
increased incidence over concurrent controls and timing relative to dosing. This transient, sporadic, 
clinical sign was not considered adverse since there were no associated changes in food consumption 
or body weight as well as lack of associated pathology findings.  
There were no test article-related changes in body weight, food consumption, electrocardiogram, body 
temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, clinical pathology, immunophenotyping (T-cells, B-cells, NK 
cells and monocytes), TDAR, plasma cytokine (IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, and IL-17), 
organ weight, or gross findings. 
Microscopic findings were observed in the kidney (mild to moderate mononuclear infiltrates in the 
interstitium of 1 male at 10 mg/kg/week and 1 female at 30 mg/kg/week), liver (mild mixed cell 
inflammation in 1 male at 30 mg/kg/week) and heart (mild mononuclear cell myocardial infiltrates 
accompanied by minimal multifocal myocardial degeneration in 1 female at 100 mg/kg/week) at the 
end of the dosing period. Mild mononuclear cell myocardial infiltrates accompanied by minimal

multifocal myocardial degeneration were also noted in one male at 100 mg/kg/week following the 8-
week recovery.  
Because of the euthanasia of 1 male at 10 mg/kg/week, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) 
could not be determined under the conditions of this study.

or  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (immunophenotyping,  immunogenicity  [ADA 
formation], cytokine levels, and TDAR).  
In the 13-week toxicity study, skin findings consistent with the features of an immune reaction were 
noted in 1 low-dose animal. In addition, sporadic microscopic findings of an immune-mediated nature 
were noted in the kidney, liver, or heart of 1 to 2 animals per group dosed with dostarlimab. The 
incidence or severity of these findings was not dose-related.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
The provided ERA consists of a justification for not performing any ERA studies due to the nature of the 
product being a monoclonal antibody unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
Monoclonal antibodies are broken down by proteolysis and the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, dostarlimab is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
Pharmacology 
Cross-species binding activity was investigated for humans and different animal species. Findings were 
consistent with sequence homology, supporting the cynomolgus monkey as an appropriate species for 
toxicological evaluation.  
The potency and selectivity of dostarlimab were evaluated in vitro using biochemical and cellular 
signalling assays and the anti-tumour activity of dostarlimab was evaluated in vitro. Due to the lack of 
reactivity between anti-human PD-1 antibodies like dostarlimab and mouse PD-1, a surrogate rat 
IgG2a anti-mouse PD-1 antibody was instead used to describe the activity of PD-1 inhibition in a 
mouse allograft model. From a non-clinical point of view, exposure-response relationship and the 
posology in patients appear to be justified. In vitro and in vivo proof of concept is considered 
established. 
Using human PBMCs it was shown that dostarlimab did not induce significant production of cytokines, 
and it is unlikely that dostarlimab will independently induce cytokine release. Further, it was shown 
that dostarlimab did not bind to C1q and is thus not likely to activate complement and exert 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Dostarlimab binding to the low-affinity Fc-γ receptor CD64 
(FcγR1) was low and consistent with its IgG4 framework, therefore dostarlimab is unlikely to elicit 
ADCC. 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were performed. Safety pharmacology core battery 
endpoints (CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory) were investigated in the 4-week repeat dose toxicity 
study (Study 273-0022-TX). No dostarlimab-related effects were observed following administration of 
0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day dostarlimab. Some statistically significant changes were observed 
sporadically, but as no systematic dose dependent changes were observed, they were deemed not to 
be related to treatment with dostarlimab.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were not provided which was considered acceptable as 
dostarlimab is intended as monotherapy. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that interaction with CYP 
450 or drug transporters are unlikely to occur for monoclonal antibodies and no further information is 
required. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (ADME) of dostarlimab was evaluated as part of the general toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Distribution, metabolism and excretion was not investigated, which is 
acceptable according to ICH S6.  
The methods developed to measure dostarlimab and anti-dostarlimab antibody in cynomolgus monkey 
serum in support of the GLP pivotal toxicological studies have been suitably validated. 
The PK after both single and repeat dosing appear well described in monkeys with an approximately 
dose proportional increase in exposure. PK properties of dostarlimab showed long half-life, low 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 41/176 
 
 
  
 
 
clearance and a low steady state distribution volume in the range of the plasma volume for monkeys, 
which indicates that dostarlimab remains mainly in the vascular system. There were no significant 
gender differences. It appeared that accumulation of dostarlimab (2.1 to 3.6-fold) occurred in monkeys 
in the TK investigations. 
Neutralising anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was investigated following single and repeat dose 
administration. It was found that between 33.3-66.7% of the single dose animals and 8.33-75% of the 
repeat dose animals developed ADA during the studies. ADA incidences were however correlated with 
overall TK parameters and compared to animals negative for ADAs and no significant impact on TK 
were observed. One ADA-positive animal in the 13-week repeat dose study did however show fast 
clearance of dostarlimab, suggesting that its elimination kinetics were affected by the presence of ADA. 
This animal was excluded from the group mean analysis. ADA in animals does not necessarily predict 
the clinical situation, however, in the present studies, ADA development did not affect serum 
concentration of dostarlimab in general.  
The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion. This is acceptable as in 
accordance with regulatory guidelines for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6), no tissues 
distribution studies, metabolism studies, mass balance investigations are considered necessary. The 
low volume of distribution ranging between 43.9-48.4 mL/kg at steady state suggests that most of the 
monoclonal antibody remains in the bloodstream. The metabolism and clearance of dostarlimab in vivo 
is expected to follow the degradation route of mABs in general, via biochemical pathways that are 
independent of metabolising enzymes. Dostarlimab is expected to be degraded into small peptides, 
amino acids and small carbohydrates, that are eliminated by renal excretion or returned to the nutrient 
pool. 
The lack of PK drug-drug interaction studies is acceptable as it is assumed that interaction with 
metabolising enzymes and transporters will not occur in vivo or via cytokines. 
Toxicology 
Overall the toxicology study package is in line with what is expected based on ICH S9, ICH S6 and ICH 
M3 (R2) for a monoclonal antibody with only one pharmacologically active species (Cynomolgus 
monkey), for a biopharmaceutical intended for advanced cancer.  
The single dose and repeat dose studies of 4- and 13-week duration were all performed with similar 
dose levels of dostarlimab (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg).  
No adverse toxicities were observed in the single dose toxicity study and the high dose level (100 
mg/kg) was considered to be the NOAEL.  
Dostarlimab was well tolerated by most animals following repeated dose administration once weekly 
for 4 or 13 weeks at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg. No dostarlimab related findings were made in the 4-week 
toxicity study, where safety pharmacology endpoints were included. Sporadic and dose unrelated 
macroscopic and/or microscopic findings of an immune-mediated nature were observed in the skin, 
kidney, liver, or heart of 1 to 2 animals/group dosed with dostarlimab. It was uncertain whether these 
findings were dostarlimab related as they were not seen in any other dostarlimab dosed animals. 
In the 13 weeks study, one male animal presented with a skin-condition during the first week after 
start of treatment, which despite efforts to treat the skin condition, worsened during the study, and 
ultimately the animal had to be euthanised on Day 89. Histological findings were consistent with an 
immune response. The animal did develop ADA, but these were not considered to have contributed to 
the condition given the low titer of ADA and the lack of correlation between the titer and progression of 
skin findings. The skin condition could not be excluded to be related to treatment with dostarlimab and 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 42/176 
 
 
  
 
 
could be due to the pharmacologic effect of dostarlimab. Due to the finding in this animal, no NOAEL 
could be established for this study.  
In general, the exposure margins in animals are considered sufficient. In both the single dose and 2-
week repeat dose study, the high dose group (100 mg/kg/day administered once weekly) was 
established as the NOAEL. This is supported, as no dostarlimab related toxicities were identified in 
these studies. However, in the 13-week repeat dose study, the NOAEL could not be established, due to 
the finding described above occurring in one animal in the low dose group (10 mg/kg). At this dose 
level, the AUC0-168h was 74,500 μg•h/mL, corresponding to approximately 6 and 5 times the clinical 
exposure at 500 mg Q3W andQ6W. respectively. 
Overall, dostarlimab appears to be well tolerated and no special hazard were identified for humans based 
on repeat-dose toxicity studies of duration up to 3 months in the cynomolgus monkey (see SmPC section 
5.3). 
No studies have been performed to assess the potential of dostarlimab for carcinogenicity or 
genotoxicity which was considered acceptable based on ICH S6 (R1). In addition, the ICH S9 guidance 
for development of therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer specify that 
carcinogenicity studies are not needed for these indications. 
Animal reproduction and development toxicity studies have not been conducted with dostarlimab. A 
literature-based risk assessment was provided and identified that there may be a reproductive risk 
following treatment with dostarlimab, as PD-1/L1 pathway is involved in the foeto-maternal tolerance, 
and normal function is considered important in upholding a normal pregnancy. Blockade of PD-L1 
signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to 
result in an increase in foetal loss. These results indicate a potential risk that administration of 
dostarlimab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or 
stillbirth (see SmPC section 5.3). Therefore, dostarlimab is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see SmPC section 4.6) and the risks have 
been reflected in the SmPC. 
While fertility studies were not submitted, no notable effects on the male and female reproductive 
organs were observed in monkeys in the 1 month and 3 month repeat dose toxicology studies; 
however, these results may not be representative at all of the potential clinical risk because of the 
immaturity of the reproductive system of animals used in the studies. Therefore, fertility toxicity 
remains unknown (see SmPC section 5.3). 
No juvenile animal toxicity studies were provided. Toxicology studies for dostarlimab were performed 
in cynomolgus monkeys aged 2.5 to 5.1 years. This is equivalent to ≥10 years for humans. No specific 
issues were observed in the cynomolgus monkeys that warrant studies in younger animals 
No additional reproductive and developmental studies are planned in order to reduce the use of 
animals in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles (ICH M3 [R2]) which is considered 
acceptable. 
No stand-alone local tolerance studies were performed. Observation of injection site reactions were 
incorporated in the single and repeated dose toxicity studies. No dostarlimab related local tolerance 
issues were observed in cynomolgus monkeys.   
The lack of any metabolite studies is accepted considering the product being a monoclonal antibody 
which is expected to be degraded by proteolytic pathways. 
Impurities were not studied in the non-clinical setting. The test item batch used in the 13-week repeat 
dose study was also used in the clinical study GARNET. The test item batch used in the 4-week repeat 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021

dose study, as well as the definitive TCR studies was from an earlier production process; however, it 
was demonstrated to be comparable to clinical batch.   
The tissue-cross reactivity studies performed in human and Cynomolgus monkey tissues did not show 
any unexpected binding. 
No ERA studies were submitted which is acceptable considering the nature of the product in line with 
the ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21 *). Dostarlimab being a monoclonal antibody is 
unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
An adequate program of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology was conducted in disease models for 
dostarlimab, supporting the intended clinical use. Nonclinical proof of concept as an inhibitor of PD-1 
ligand binding appear well-established.  
Pharmacokinetics of dostarlimab is well described, and no deficiencies were identified. 
An abbreviated toxicology program was performed, in line with the ICH S6, ICH M3 (R2) and ICH S9 
guidelines. Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in the 4 week repeat-dose toxicity study. No 
reproductive investigations were performed, but a literature-based risk assessment was presented. In 
principle the minimal toxicology program can be considered sufficient.  
The SmPC reflects the findings of the toxicity studies, as well as the reproductive risk based on current 
knowledge from the literature.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Table 14: Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Clinical pharmacology data with dostarlimab is available from clinical study 4010-01-001 (GARNET).  
Dostarlimab was characterized using population PK analysis from 477 patients with various solid 
tumours, including 267 patients with EC. 
Analytical Methods 
PK Assays 
ELISA bioanalytical methods were validated and used for the determination of dostarlimab concentration 
in human serum. 
Immunogenicity assays 
Two immunogenicity assays were validated. An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method was utilized 
to detect, confirm, and determine the titre of anti-dostarlimab antibodies in human serum. The 
analysis was performed in three stages consisting on an initial screening followed by a confirmatory 
analysis and a titre analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 45/176 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Positive samples were tested for neutralizing anti-dostarlimab antibodies (NAb) by a competitive 
ligand-binding assay with ECL. In this method, samples are pre-cleaned to remove dostarlimab from 
the serum and then mixed with a fixed amount of dostarlimab to form a NAb-drug complex.  
Absorption  
No studies assessing absorption were submitted as dostarlimab is administered intravenously. 
Distribution 
Based on POSTHOC parameters, dostarlimab had a mean steady state systemic clearance of 
0.00742 L/hr, a steady-state mean volume of distribution of 5.34 L and a mean terminal half-life of 
25.4 days. The population clearance estimate was approximately 15.5% lower at steady state when 
compared to single dose. POSTHOC parameter estimate summaries are presented below. 
Table 15: Dostarlimab POSTHOC PK parameter summary (population PK analysis)  
Note: POSTHOC: posterior conditional estimation 
Elimination 
No metabolism or excretion studies with dostarlimab were submitted (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). 
Excretion 
The degradation products are eliminated by renal excretion or returned to the nutrient pool without 
biological effects. 
In Study 4010-01-001 (GARNET), geometric mean values of CL ranged from 6.677 to 13.60 mL/h for 
Part 1 and were 9.007 and 8.814 mL/h in Part 2A after 500 mg Q3W and 1000 mg Q6W, respectively.  
The half-life ranged from 244.4 to 491.0 hours (10.2 to 20.5 days) in Part 1. For Part 2A, geometric 
mean values were within the range observed for Part 1 data (346.8 and 469.3 hours for t1/2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality and Time dependency  
Statistical assessment of dostarlimab dose-proportionality for Part 1 over a dose range of 1 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg in Cycle 1 is presented in Table 16 below.

Table 16: Summary of assessment for Dostarlimab dose proportionality in Part 1 Cycle 1  
Multiple-dose PK data were limited to few subjects for Part 1 and Part 2A (n < 3 per DL for each PK 
parameter at all levels).  
Albeit based on limited available data, in comparison to Cycle 1, data in multiple-dose cycles generally 
indicated an intra-individual decrease in clearance (with exception of one subject in the 10 mg/kg 
PK/PDy treatment group).  
Following multiple-dose administration, accumulation of dostarlimab ranged between 180% to 374% 
for AUC(0-tau) and 126% to 259% for Cmax in Part 1 and 2A. 
Table 17: Summary of dostarlimab PK parameters for each treatment for Part 1 Cycle 6  
Table 18: Summary of dostarlimab PK parameters for each treatment for Part 2A Cycle 5 
(Q3W) or Cycle 4 (Q6W)  
When dosed at the recommended therapeutic dose (500 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks 
for 4 doses, followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks), dostarlimab showed an approximate two-fold 
accumulation (Cmin) starting cycle 4 through cycle 12, consistent with the terminal half-life (t1/2).  
Exposure (both maximum concentration [Cmax] and the area under the concentration-time curve, 
[AUC0-tau] and [AUC0-inf]) was approximately dose proportional (see SmPC section 5.2).

Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Base population PK model 
Inter-individual variability was tested on all central compartment parameters for 1-compartment 
models and intercompartmental clearances (Q) and the peripheral volumes of distribution (V2) for 2-
compartment models. Residual error was modelled as proportional, additive, and additive plus 
proportional.  
The final base model selected was a 2-compartment model with IIV on clearance (CL) and central 
volume of distribution (V1) with a proportional residual error model (base model 2C11) and an off-
diagonal correlation between CL and V1. This term was carried forward for all subsequent model 
building. 
The population typical values and residual variability (RSV) estimates are shown in Table 19 . The 
precision for all structural model parameters and RSV estimates, as measured by relative standard 
error (RSE%), was less than 25%. The final base PK model fitted the data adequately. The population 
typical values and residual variability (RSV) estimates are shown in Table 19. The precision for all 
structural model parameters and RSV estimates, as measured by relative standard error (RSE%), was 
less than 25%.

Final population PK model 
The final model incorporated several covariates: albumin on central clearance, alkaline phosphatase on 
central volume, alkaline phosphatase on central clearance, SLDR on central clearance, sex on central 
volume, positive ADA on central clearance, and age on central clearance. Its inclusion partially reduced 
the inter-individual variability on CL (37% to 30%) and V1 (23% to 19%).

Part 2A 500 mg Q3W and 1000 mg Q6W VPCs showed overlapping prediction and confidence intervals 
after 2016 hours post-dose. The protocol defined dosing window for Part 2B after Cycle 1 appeared in 
the corresponding VPC. The varied dosing times led to multiple peaks before and after the scheduled 
dosing time as seen in Cycle 2 and the observed data for Cycle 4. An additional VPC was completed for 
Cycle 4 using time after dose to correct for the dosing time inconsistencies.  
Model predictability was demonstrated for the VPC which showed the majority of the observed 
concentrations were contained within the 95% prediction interval for each presentation. 
Special populations 
In the PK population, 173 patients had normal renal function, 210 had mild renal impairment, 90 had 
moderate renal impairment while 3 patients had severe renal impairment and 1 patient had end-stage 
renal disease. Most patients had normal liver function while 48 had mild liver impairment and 4 had 
moderate liver impairment. No patients with severe liver impairment were included in the study. 
Gender was a significant co-variate of V. Almost ¾ of the study population were female. Race was 
adequately represented in the study population. Weight ranged from 34 kg to 182 kg in the PK 
population. Dostarlimab was not studied in children. 
Impaired renal function  
Dostarlimab PK was similar between patients with normal renal function and those with mild or 
moderate renal impairment.

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity of dostarlimab 
ADA sampling in Study 4010-01-001 
For Part 1 and 2A serum samples for the determination of anti-dostarlimab antibodies were the same 
samples as those collected as for assessment of drug PK. Predose samples and samples at or after 96 
hours postdose were included for the analysis. For Part 2B, serum samples for the determination of 
anti-dostarlimab antibodies were collected predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (baseline), Cycle 4 (9 weeks), 
Cycle 5 (12 weeks), Cycle 8 (30 weeks), and Cycle 12 (54 weeks), and then at a safety follow-up visit 
approximately 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
There were 1543 samples tested for antibodies to dostarlimab. Of these, 1376 (89.2%) were negative 
for dostarlimab ADA, 130 (8.4%) confirmed positive, and 37 (2.4%) were inconclusive. Overall, the 
prevalence of baseline positive samples was 16.5%, ranging from 0.0% in Part 1 to 17.3% in Part 2B. 
In Part 2B, the prevalence was 17.3% at baseline, but fell to 5.1% at Cycle 4 and 0.0% by Cycle 12.

Table 21: prevalence of anti-dostarlimab antibodies by visit, Part 2B  
Of the patients with treatment-emergent ADA, 7 tested positive for NAb at one or more time points. In 
addition, there were 33 patients who were categorized as having treatment-unaffected ADA (pre-
existing ADA with no meaningful increase in titer), who were positive for NAb at one or more time 
points during the study. 
None of the 13 patients with treatment-emergent ADA reported a serious adverse event or infusion 
reaction. Twelve reported a drug-related AE, 5 reported an immune-related AE, and 1 patient reported 
hypersensitivity. 
There were 4 patients with treatment-emergent ADA in the Part 2B EC cohort. Of these 4 patients, 2 
were classified as having complete or partial response (ORR) with 1 patient having a duration of 
response of at least 6 months. 
In the PopPK analysis, inference regarding the effect of ADA was inconclusive. When tested as 
transient (time-varying positive or negative), ADA was statistically significant leading to a 17% 
increase in systemic clearance. However, when ADA was tested as persistent (negative until first 
positive, then carried forward as positive for the rest of the study) or on a subject level (positive for all 
records if any test result was positive, negative otherwise), the effect was not statistically significant. 
The final model included ADA as a part of stepwise selection based on numeric criteria (AIC).

Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies were submitted. 
The mechanism of action for dostarlimab was evaluated in a series of in vitro binding studies and in 
vivo studies (see non-clinical section).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Dostarlimab PD-1 Receptor Occupancy (RO) was determined in peripheral blood from patients following 
the first dose in Parts 1, 2A and 2B of Study 4010-01-001. Both a conventional receptor occupancy 
(cRO) assay, which provided a measure of dostarlimab direct binding to CD3+ cells, as well as a 
functional receptor occupancy (fRO) assay, which measured dostarlimab downstream signal

modulation via IL-2 production, were used for the PD analysis. The cRO and fRO assays were 
validated. 
Conventional Receptor Occupancy (cRO) 
The cRO assay was performed by flow cytometry using a qualified phenotyping antibody panel on 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from whole blood samples. The binding of dostarlimab was 
determined for each T cell subset (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+).   
Data were available for all 21 patients in Part 1, all 13 patients in Part 2A, and 121 patients in Part 2B. 
The analysis of Parts 1 and 2A focused on the serial samples collected over the first dosing interval, 
where maximal RO was obtained at the first post-dose sample and maintained for all doses and dose 
regimens tested. Part 1 data is presented in Figure 27.

In Part 2B of the study, samples were drawn at predose on Days 1 and 22, and at the end of 
treatment. Maximal PD-1 occupancy was observed following the first dose of 500 mg dostarlimab, 
directly before the next dose at Day 22 (Figure 28). The results were independent of tumour type.

Functional Receptor Occupancy (fRO) 
The fRO assay was used to evaluate the downstream effects of dostarlimab binding on cells derived 
from patients dosed with dostarlimab, by measuring cytokine (IL-2) secretion by ex vivo 
staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) -stimulated polyclonal T cells in whole blood samples.  
Samples were collected in Parts 1 and 2A at the same timepoints as for the cRO assessments.  Data 
was available from 21 patients in Part 1 and 13 patients in Part 2A.  Full fRO (ratio of approximately 1) 
was obtained and maintained for all doses and dose regimens tested. In Part 1, full fRO was achieved 
following administration of a single dose of dostarlimab and maintained at least until the second 
scheduled dose of study drug (Figure 29).

Similarly, in Part 2A, full fRO was achieved following administration of a single dose of dostarlimab 
starting at the first postdose sample and maintained at least until the second scheduled dose of study 
drug for virtually all patients. No differences were observed in RO between the two dose regimens of 
500 mg dostarlimab Q3W and 1000 mg dostarlimab Q6W. 
Secondary pharmacology 
An analysis of potential cardiac effects of dostarlimab was conducted to examine trends and look for a 
potential relationship between dostarlimab concentrations and effects on QT prolongation. Potential 
effects were assessed by analysis of central tendency, the incidence of clinical noteworthy ECG values, 
morphological assessment of rhythm abnormalities at the recommended therapeutic dose, and an 
analysis of dostarlimab concentration and baseline-corrected QT interval (corrected using Fridericia’s 
formula) (QTcF). Standard 12-lead triplicate ECGs were recorded. 
The QTcF change from baseline at predose and at the end-of-infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 4, 5, 8, 
and 12, and at the end of treatment visit for all patients in Part 2B were used for the analysis of central 
tendency of QTcF prolongation per ICH E14 Guidance. Cycle 1 Day 1 predose timepoint was considered 
as baseline. Standard 12-lead triplicate ECGs were recorded and interpreted by a qualified physician at 
the site.  
All of the upper bounds of the 90% 2-sided CI of mean ∆QTcF were below the threshold of 10 
milliseconds (msec). The greatest mean QTcF increase from baseline was 5.741 msec (2-sided 90% 
CI: 3.438, 8.043 msec), observed at the Cycle 5 Day 1, 0.5 hr timepoint. For at all other post-dose 
timepoints the mean ∆QTcF was less than 5 msec and the upper 90% 2-sided CI ranged from 1.885 to 
8.043 msec. Mean change from baseline is presented in Figure 19.

Figure 30: Mean Change from Baseline QTcF vs Time (with 2-sided 90% CI)  
The relationship between dostarlimab concentrations and the ∆QTcF interval was also evaluated by 
exposure-response modeling of the predose and end-of-infusion dostarlimab concentrations and 
corresponding ∆QTcF values collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 4, 5, 8, and 12, and at the end of 
treatment visit for all patients in Part 2B at the recommended therapeutic dose. Cycle 1 Day 1 predose 
timepoint was considered as baseline. Standard 12-lead triplicate ECGs were recorded and interpreted

Concentration  
The relationship between dostarlimab concentration and ∆QTcF was assessed using a random 
coefficients mixed effects model for the ∆QTcF values. The slope of the exposure-response relationship 
between the change from baseline in QTcF interval and dostarlimab concentration was not significantly 
different from zero (0.001589 msec/µg/mL; 95% CI: -0.004208, 0.007386 msec/µg/mL; p=0.5906) 
and the intercept estimate was 2.406 msec (95% CI: 0.1037, 4.709 msec).

The mean ∆QTcF increase was less than 5 msec at all scheduled post-dose timepoints with associated 
drug concentrations. The upper bound of the 2 sided 90% CI was less than 10 msec, below the 
threshold of regulatory concern per the ICH E14 Guidance.

PK/PD model 
The proposed dose and schedule for dostarlimab is 500 mg Q3W for 4 cycles followed by 1,000 mg 
Q6W for all subsequent cycles. This dose and schedule were determined in the GARNET study based on 
the PK and RO analysis of Part 1 and Part 2A data during development. Dose selection was guided 
primarily by the observed RO data from peripheral blood cells. Full RO was achieved at dostarlimab 
serum concentrations of 2.435 μg/mL and above. One patient with positive ADA at 1 mg/kg with a 
dostarlimab serum concentration of 1.51 µg/mL did not have full target engagement based on the IL-2 
functional assay. At the time of dose selection, PK and RO data from 16 patients from Part 1 were used 
for dose and exposure projections using PK modelling. The model predicted Ctrough at steady state for 
the 500 mg Q3W and 1,000 mg Q6W doses were 51.1 and 29.2 μg/mL with associated 90% CIs of 
13.4 and 111.1 μg/mL and 4.1 and 78.5 μg/mL, respectively. Importantly, 90% lower bound of the 
mean predicted Ctrough following 500 mg Q3W and 1,000 mg Q6W dosing is 5.5- and 1.7-fold of, 
respectively, the level required for full target engagement of peripheral blood cells. 
A PK/PD model was used to further confirm the projected RTD. In a comparative analysis the PK-target 
engagement for pembrolizumab and dostarlimab were analysed. First, pembrolizumab data were 
digitized (Elassaiss-Schaap et al. 2017) and analysed together with dostarlimab interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
functional assay results. A NONMEM sigmoid Emax model was fitted to the data. 
Based on the model, concentrations of 54 μg/ml for dostarlimab and 43 μg/ml for pembrolizumab are 
estimated to maintain 90% of maximal PD-1 suppression in tumours, assuming a 3-fold tissue dilution 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021

for typical mAbs (Shah and Betts 2012). For pembrolizumab at steady state of the 200 mg flat dose, 
mean Ctrough is about 29 μg/mL and mean Cavg is about 45 µg/mL (Freshwater et al. 2017). For 
dostarlimab at steady state, both the 500 mg Q3W (model predicted Ctrough 101 μg/mL, Cavg 147 
μg/mL) and 1,000 mg Q6W (model predicted Ctrough 71 μg/mL, Cavg 147 μg/mL) doses maintain 
maximal peripheral PD-1 suppression at maximal levels throughout the respective dosing intervals. 
The dostarlimab Ctrough levels for patients in Part 2B (observed data) from Cycle 4 to Cycle 12 were 
approximately 70 µg/mL on average (predose Cycle 4, 5, 8, and 12: Mean±standard 
deviation=72.75±26.79 μg/mL, 82.89±35.86 μg/mL, 85.29±46.43 μg/mL, and 77.68±35.10 μg/mL, 
respectively).  
Compared to 1 mg/kg, the observed Ctrough (Day 22) after a single dose is 4.24 µg/mL with a standard 
deviation of ±2.38 µg/mL. With about 2-fold accumulation at steady state, the 1 mg/kg dose or the 
equivalent flat dose will not be able to reach the required full target engagement concentration of 54 
µg/mL at tumour sites as well as 18 µg/mL at peripheral sites.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-efficacy 
The time to event response (DOR) was to be assessed using Cox proportional hazard models with 
exposure as the independent predictor. These analyses were restricted to responders, per the OR 
definition. These analyses were not carried out due to the small number of subjects with a DOR 
measurement (i.e. losing OR, after achieving it). 
ORR was plotted against quantile groups for dostarlimab exposure, overlain with model predicted 
curves.

The relationship between dostarlimab exposure (Cavg and Cmax for 1000 mg Q6W of Cycle 5 RP2D) 
and the incidence of selected AEs (the top 5, with respect to incidence, for drug related AEs) was 
assessed using the same methods specified for dichotomous response efficacy variables. The safety 
population including Part 2B was used for these analyses, subset to subjects with PK parameters 
estimated, both for Part 2B in entirety, and for Part B excluding NSCLC patients. For the latter analysis, 
the same stratification approach for the exposure relationship was used, as for the efficacy analysis.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical Methods 
A ELISA bioanalytical method was submitted for the determination of dostarlimab concentration in 
support of the study No. 4010-01-001. 
In general, the pre-study validation of the analytical methods is satisfactory. In addition, the in-study 
validation shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs. 
Two immunogenicity assays were described and validated. The design of the ADA and NAb detection 
assays is considered appropriate. Validation reports were provided, showing that the assays are 
suitable for their intended purpose. However, the Applicant is recommended to improve the 3-tier ADA 
assays to target a drug tolerance of at least 200 µg/mL of 100 ng/mL positive control. In principle, 
evaluation of drug tolerance should include additional positive controls with concentrations above and 
below the target sensitivity level of 100 ng/mL. When substantial improvements in method 
performance are achieved, the applicant will submit the results of the improved ADA methods once 
they are validated (REC).  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Dostarlimab is administered via the intravenous route and therefore estimates of absorption are not 
applicable (see SmPC section 5.2). 
No metabolism or excretion studies with dostarlimab were submitted in accordance with the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals. Dostarlimab is a therapeutic mAb IgG4 that is expected to be 
catabolised into small peptides, amino acids, and small carbohydrates by lysosome through fluid phase 
or receptor mediated endocytosis. The degradation products are eliminated by renal excretion or 
returned to the nutrient pool without biological effects (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Dostarlimab was characterised using population PK analysis from 477 patients with various solid 
tumours. This population PK modelling strategy was implemented to characterise the time-course PK 
profiles after dostarlimab administration using a sequential modelling approach: first, the base model 
was developed, then a covariate analysis was performed based on the significant covariate-parameter 
relationships previously explored and, at the last stage, the final population pharmacokinetic model 
was evaluated using the standard methodologies.  
•  Base model 
A two compartments model with time-dependency clearance was selected as the base structural PK 
model. A weight-scaling effect on CL and V1 was incorporated using estimated allometric exponents 
(0.51 for CL and 0.48 for V1), which differ from the standard allometric exponents. In general, the 
model seems able to describe the overall tendency of the experimental data and parameters were 
estimated precisely.  
• 
Final model 
The final model incorporates several covariates: albumin on central clearance, alkaline phosphatase on 
central volume, alkaline phosphatase on central clearance, SLDR on central clearance, sex on central 
volume, positive ADA on central clearance, and age on central clearance. Its inclusion partially reduced 
the inter-individual variability on CL (37% to 30%) and V1 (23% to 19%).  
Independent visual predictive checks were presented for each dose level and cycle of administration 
(Part 2A). The Applicant provided Forest plots of relevant covariates (sex, ADA status, weight, albumin, 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 73/176 
 
 
  
 
 
 
alkaline phosphatase, age, diameter of target lesions by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST)) that did not indicate any clinically relevant effect on dostarlimab exposure (Cavg and Cmax) 
at Cycle 1. Female subjects have lower exposure than male subjects but the effect was within the 0.8 
and 1.2 bounds.  
Weight evaluated in the range of 47.7-110.8 kg had great impact on dostarlimab exposure as 
anticipated. Forest plots of the effect of significant covariates on dostarlimab exposure at Cycle 5 were 
provided (data not shown). These data showed high body weight and low baseline albumin had effect 
on Cavg outside of the 0.8 bound. Patients of body weight 110.8 kg have dostarlimab Cavg 20.8% 
lower than the reference patients while patients with baseline ALB 28.9 g/L have dostarlimab Cavg 
24.3% lower than the reference patients. The Forest plot of effect on Cmin was not provided. Across 
the Pop PK population, weights and baseline albumin ranged from 34-182 kg and 19-51 g/L which is 
somewhat wider than evaluated in the Forest plots.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment was evaluated based on the estimated creatinine clearance [CLCR mL/min] (normal: 
CLCR  ≥  90 mL/min,  n = 173;  mild:  CLCR = 60-89 mL/min,  n = 210;  moderate:  CLCR = 30-59 mL/min, 
n = 90; severe: CLCR = 15-29 mL/min, n = 3 and ESRD: CLCR < 15 mL/min, n = 1). The effect of renal 
impairment on the clearance of dostarlimab was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic analyses in 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. No 
clinically important differences in the clearance of dostarlimab were found between patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Based on the available data, no 
dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are limited 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis (see SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment was evaluated as defined using the US National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic 
dysfunction  by  total  bilirubin  and  AST  (Normal:  total  bilirubin  (TB)  &  AST  < =  upper  limit  of  normal 
(ULN), n = 425; mild: TB > ULN to 1.5 ULN or AST > ULN, n = 48; and moderate: TB > 1.5-3 ULN, any 
AST,  n = 4).  The  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  clearance  of  dostarlimab  was  evaluated  by 
population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to patients with 
normal hepatic function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of dostarlimab were found 
between patients with mild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. Based on the available data, 
no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (see SmPC section 4.2). 
There are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Effect of weight was evaluated using data from study Part 1 and 2A and did not indicate any clinically 
relevant effect. In Study Part 2B, Cmin at Cycle 5 was shown to be significantly related to overall 
response. A doubling of Cmin increase odds ratio by 2.4-3.3-fold in the endometrial cancer and pan 
tumour patient groups. Hence Cmin is important for OR. The exposure in over-weighted patients (120-
180 kg) at the proposed dosing regimen (RTD) provides for the vast majority of patients (>95.7%) 
dostarlimab levels above the efficacy threshold (18 mg/L). No obvious trends based on body weight 
were seen in ORR or in the incidence of TEAEs (data not shown). The patients with body weights 
>120 kg seemed to have less benefit in terms of ORR. However, there were only 4 very obese patients 
in the efficacy population which is too low to draw any firm conclusion.  
The population PK analysis of the patient data indicates that there are no clinically important effects of 
age (range: 24 to 86 years), gender or race, ethnicity, or tumour type on the clearance of dostarlimab 
(see SmPC section 5.2). No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are aged 65 years or 
over. There are limited clinical data with dostarlimab in patients aged 75 years or over.

Interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as dostarlimab are not 
substrates for cytochrome P450 or active substance transporters. Dostarlimab is not a cytokine and is 
unlikely to be a cytokine modulator. Additionally, pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction of dostarlimab with 
small molecule active substances is not expected. There is no evidence of interaction mediated by non-
specific clearance of lysosome degradation for antibodies (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Primary pharmacology 
Dostarlimab is an IgG4-k anti-PD-1 antibody which binds with high affinity to PD-1 to block the 
interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2 ligands. The required concentration for full target 
engagement has been determined to 54 µg/mL at tumour sites and 18 µg/mL at peripheral sites. A 
lower dose e.g. 1 mg/kg or equivalent fixed dose will not be able to maintain full target engagement 
throughout treatment. Full receptor occupancy as measured by both the direct PD 1 binding and 
interleukin 2 (IL 2) production functional assay was maintained throughout the dosing interval at the 
recommended therapeutic dosing regimen (see SmPC section 5.2).  
Secondary pharmacology 
No clinically relevant QtcF prolongation is expected based on the experimental data provided and the 
analysis performed.  
Exposure-response 
Baseline clearance rather than exposure has been identified as a significant predictor of overall survival 
in subjects treated with nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Bajaj et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017, Turner et 
al. 2018)). The clinical relevance of baseline CL could be a confounding factor for the E-R relationship, 
since CL is highly correlated with patient survival. The use of cycle 5 exposure metrics was justified as 
the highest exposure level collected and the closest value to the efficacy measurement. 
No exposure-efficacy relationship has been established between dostarlimab (Cavg and Cmin) and 
overall response in any of the populations studied. An exposure-response was estimated between Cmin 
and odds ratio in EC and pan tumour populations (2.4- and 2.6-fold increase). However, it is unclear 
how changes in PK parameters due to time-dependency effects, may affect the exposure-efficacy 
relationship.  
No exposure-safety relationship was established between dostarlimab exposure (Cmax and Cavg) and 
the probability of the most common dostarlimab related adverse events in patients receiving the 
proposed dosing regimens (Part 2B). An inverse exposure-safety relationship was demonstrated when 
a full analysis was performed, but no statistically significant relationships were encountered in patients 
with EC, dMMR/MSI-H EC, and dMMR/MSI-H pan tumour. 
Dose selection 
Selection of the recommended therapeutic dosing regimen (500 mg Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 
1,000 mg Q6W for all subsequent cycles) was based on the efficacy, safety, receptor occupancy, and 
population PK analysis of dostarlimab observed to date and is discussed under section 2.5.3. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
Dostarlimab has been characterised using experimental data from Study 4010-01-001. Data from dose 
escalation (Part 1A) and proposed dosing regimens after single and multiple dosing regimens of 500 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 75/176 
 
 
  
 
 
 
mg Q3W and 1000 mg Q6W have been used. The methodology applied to characterise the 
pharmacokinetics and interactions through non-compartmental analysis and population approach is 
generally endorsed.  
Exploratory and statistical evaluations were performed between dostarlimab Cavg, Cmin and Cmax and 
different efficacy and safety endpoints. The lack of a significant exposure-efficacy may limit the 
conclusions regarding the effective dostarlimab exposure. Despite the limitations it can be concluded 
that, based on exposure efficacy and safety relationships, there are no clinically significant differences 
in efficacy and safety when doubling the exposure of dostarlimab.

2.5.2.  Main study  
Study 4010-01-001 (GARNET)  
Methods 
This is a phase 1 Dose Escalation and cohort expansion study of dostarlimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors. 
Figure 34: Study 4010-01-001 (GARNET) Phase 1 study schema  
Study 4010-01-001 is a multicentre, open-label study with expansion cohorts designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity of dostarlimab in patients with recurrent or advanced 
solid  tumours  who  experienced  disease  progression  on  or  after  treatment  with  available  anticancer 
therapies.  
The study is being conducted in 2 parts:  
- Part 1 of the study evaluates dose-limiting toxicities, overall safety, and the PK/PD profile of ascending 
weight-based doses of dostarlimab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 77/176 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
- Part 2 of the study is subdivided into Part 2A and Part 2B.  
Part  2A  (fixed-dose  safety  evaluation  cohorts)  of  the  study  evaluated  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
dostarlimab  at  2 fixed  (flat;  non-weight  based)  doses:    500  mg  administered  Q3W  and  1,000  mg 
administered Q6W up to 2 years. Subjects in Part 2A who received at least 4 cycles of dostarlimab using 
the Q3W dosing regimen were allowed to switch to the Q6W dosing regimen. 
In  Part 2B  (expansion  cohorts),  the  clinical  activity  and  safety  of  dostarlimab  at  the  recommended 
therapeutic dose is being evaluated in several expansion cohorts. In Part 2B of the study, subjects are 
enrolled in 1 of 4 expansion cohorts according to the following tumour types: dMMR/MSI-H EC (Cohort 
A1),  MMR-proficient/MSS  EC  (Cohort  A2),  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  (Cohort  E),  and 
dMMR/MSI-H or POLE-mutated non-EC (Cohort F).  
Study Participants  
Part 2B of the study was initiated at 123 sites in 9 countries. The study is executed at sites in the US, 
Europe (Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Poland), and Canada.  
Inclusion criteria 
For inclusion into Cohort A1 or Cohort A2 of Part 2B of this study, subjects were required to fulfill all of 
the following criteria: 
1. Subject was at least 18 years old.  
2. Subject had proven recurrent or advanced solid tumour and disease progression after treatment with 
available anticancer therapies or was intolerant to treatment that met the requirements for the part of 
the study they participated in.  
a.  Part  2B:  Histologically  of  cytologically  proven  recurrent  or  advanced  solid  tumour  with 
measurable lesion(s) per RECIST v1.1 and met one of the following disease types:  
The criteria below were met for subjects participating in  
a. Cohort A1 – Subjects with dMMR/MSI-H EC and  
b. Cohort A2 – Subjects with MMR-proficient/MSS EC  
• Subjects had progressed on or after platinum doublet therapy.  
• Subjects had received no more than 2 lines of anticancer therapy for recurrent or advanced (≥Stage 
III B) disease. Prior treatment with hormone therapies was acceptable and did not count toward the 
number of anticancer therapies noted in the criterion above for this cohort.  
• All EC histologies were allowed, except endometrial sarcoma (including carcinosarcoma).  
• Subjects submitted 2 scans demonstrating an increase in tumour measurement that met criteria for 
PD on or after the latest systemic anticancer therapy based on RECIST v1.1 to Central Radiology prior 
to the first dose of dostarlimab.

Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 78/176 
 
 
  
 
 
• Status of tumour MMR/MSI: Subjects could be screened based on local MMR/MSI testing results using 
IHC, PCR, or NGS performed in a certified local laboratory, but subject eligibility was determined by MMR 
IHC  results.  For  subjects  with  available  local  MMR  IHC  results  for  the  respective  cohort(s),  tumour 
samples were submitted to a central IHC laboratory, and the quality was checked and cleared prior to 
Cycle 1/Day 1. For subjects without available local MMR IHC test results (ie, subjects with local PCR or 
NGS test results), tumour samples were submitted directly to a central IHC laboratory, and the central 
IHC results confirmed eligibility prior to proceeding with other screening procedures. After the central 
IHC test was completed, remaining tumour tissue may have been sent to a central NGS laboratory for 
further testing. 
3. Part 2B: Subjects had archival tumour tissue available that was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. 
• For subjects who did not have archival tissue, a new biopsy was performed to obtain a tissue sample 
prior to study treatment initiation. For subjects without available archival tissue, the biopsy was taken 
from  the  tumour  lesions  (either  primary  or  metastatic)  that  had  easy  accessibility  and  low  biopsy-
associated risks and excluded biopsies of the liver, brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic 
procedures extending beyond the oesophagus, stomach, or bowel.  
4. Female subjects must have had a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the date of 
the first dose of study medication; unless they were of nonchildbearing potential.  
5. Female subjects of childbearing potential (see above) must have agreed to use 1 highly effective form 
of contraception with their partners starting with the Screening Visit through 150 days after the last dose 
of study treatment.  
6. Subject had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2 for Part 1 and 
≤1 for Part 2.  
7. Subject had adequate organ function, defined as follows:  
a. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/µL  
b. platelets ≥100,000/µL  
c. haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L  
d. serum creatinine ≤1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min 
using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for subjects with creatinine levels >1.5×institutional ULN  
e. total bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN AND direct bilirubin ≤1×ULN  
f.  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  ≤2.5×ULN,  unless  liver 
metastases were present, in which case they must be ≤5×ULN  
g. international normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time ≤1.5×ULN, unless the subject was receiving 
anticoagulant therapy or as long as prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was within 
the therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
≤1.5×ULN, unless the subject was receiving anticoagulant therapy or as long as prothrombin time or 
PTT was within the therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.

1. Subject had received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.  
2. Subject had known uncontrolled central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. 
Note: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may have participated provided they were stable 
(without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment 
and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), had no evidence of new or enlarging brain 
metastases, and were clinically stable off corticosteroids for at least 7 days prior to study treatment. 
Carcinomatous meningitis precluded a subject from study participation, regardless of clinical stability.

last 2 years. Exceptions included basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 
that had undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer.  
4. Subject was considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder; a non-
malignant  systemic  disease;  or  an  active  infection  requiring  systemic  therapy.  Specific  examples 
included,  but  were  not  limited  to,  active,  non-infectious  pneumonitis;  uncontrolled  ventricular 
arrhythmia; recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction; uncontrolled major seizure disorder; unstable 
spinal cord compression; superior vena cava syndrome; or any psychiatric or substance abuse disorders 
that  would  have  interfered  with  cooperation  with  the  requirements  of  the  study  (including  obtaining 
informed consent).  
5. Subject was pregnant or breastfeeding, or expected to conceive children within the projected duration 
of the study, starting with the Screening Visit through 150 days after the last dose of study treatment.

9. Subject had an active autoimmune disease that had required systemic treatment in the past 2 years 
(i.e.,  with  the  use  of  disease-modifying  agents,  corticosteroids,  or  immunosuppressive  drugs). 
Replacement  therapy  (e.g.,  thyroxine,  insulin,  or  physiologic  corticosteroid  replacement  therapy  for 
adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc) was not considered a form of systemic treatment. Use of inhaled 
steroids, local injection of steroids, and steroid eye drops were allowed.  
10. Subject had a history of interstitial lung disease.  
11.  Subject  had not  recovered  (i.e.,  to Grade ≤1  or  to  baseline)  from  radiation- and  chemotherapy-
induced  AEs  or  received  transfusion  of  blood  products  (including  platelets  or  red  blood  cells)  or 
administration of colony-stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or recombinant erythropoietin) within 3 weeks prior to the first 
dose of study drug.

Treatments 
Dostarlimab is administered intravenously (IV) as a 30-minute infusion to all patients. 
The dosing schedule for the Part 2 B of Study 4010-01-001 is as follows: 
Dostarlimab is being administered at fixed doses of 500 mg administered Q3W for 4 cycles and 1,000 mg 
administered Q6W thereafter. Subjects with no unacceptable toxicities or no PD may be treated for up 
to 2 years in this study. Study treatment may continue beyond 2 years if the treating physician and the 
Sponsor agree that the subject continues to benefit. 
Objectives 
The objectives from protocol version 6.0 (amendment 5; 10 May 2019) relevant to Cohorts A1 in Part 
2B were the following: 
The  primary  objective  was  the  evaluation  of  the  antitumor  activity  of  dostarlimab  in  patients  with 
recurrent  or  advanced  dMMR/MSI-H  EC  (Cohort  A1)  in  terms  of  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  and 
duration of response (DOR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1.  
Secondary objectives  
 
 
 
to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of dostarlimab 
to evaluate the immunogenicity of dostarlimab 
to evaluate additional measures of clinical benefit, including the following: 
o  immune-related  disease  control  rate  (irDCR)  based  on  Investigators’  assessment  using 
immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) 
o  immune-related  duration  of  response  (irDOR)  based  on  Investigators’  assessment  using 
irRECIST 
o  immune-related  progression-free  survival  (irPFS) based  on  Investigators’  assessment  using 
irRECIST 
o progression-free survival (PFS) based on BICR using RECIST v1.1 
o  immune-related  objective  response  rate  (irORR)  based  on  Investigators’  assessment  using 
irRECIST

o disease control rate (DCR) based on Investigators’ assessment using RECIST v1.1 
o overall survival (OS) 
Exploratory objectives: 
 
 


including  genomic  alterations  (eg,  MMR/microsatellite  instability  (MSI)  and  polymerase 
[POLE]), and/or circulating biomarkers prior to treatment with dostarlimab and to correlate 
them with clinical benefit 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (European Quality of Life scale, 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels 
[EQ-5D-5L] and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30]) in subjects in Cohorts A1 and F enrolled under protocol 
amendment 3 or subsequent amendments 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints for Cohort A1 were as follows:  
ORR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving best overall response (BOR) of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed per RECIST v1.1 based on BICR 
DOR, defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR, as assessed per RECIST v1.1, 
until the time of first documentation of PD, as assessed per RECIST v1.1 based on BICR, or 
death due to any cause 
Secondary endpoints for Cohort A1 included (but were not limited to): 
DCR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving BOR of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease 
(SD), as assessed per RECIST v1.1.  
PFS, defined as the time from date of first dose to the earlier date of assessment of disease 
progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression based on the time of first 
documentation of PD per RECIST v1.1 based on BICR. 
OS, defined as the time from date of first dose of study treatment to the date of death by any 
cause. 
Immune-related  objective  response  rate  (irORR),  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients 
achieving  immune-related  best  overall  response  (irBOR)  of  immune-related  complete 
response (irCR) or immune-related partial response (irPR), as assessed per immune-related 
RECIST (irRECIST) based on Investigator’s assessment. 
Immune-related duration of response, defined as the time from first documentation of irCR 
or irPR, as assessed per irRECIST based on Investigator’s assessment, until the time of first 
documentation of immune-related progressive disease (irPD) (subsequently confirmed), as 
assessed per irRECIST based on Investigator’s assessment, or death.

Immune-related  disease  control  rate  (irDCR),  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients 
achieving irBOR of irCR, irPR, or immune-related SD, as assessed per irRECIST based on 
Investigator’s assessment. 
Immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS), defined as the time from date of first 
dose  to  the  earlier  date  of  assessment  of  irPD  or  death  by  any  cause  in  the  absence  of 
progression based on the time of first documentation of irPD (subsequently confirmed) per 
irRECIST based on Investigator’s assessment. 
Exploratory endpoints 
PRO: The European Quality of Life scale, 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels and European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire were used to assess 
cancer-specific health-related quality of life. PRO assessments were added to the study 
under protocol amendment 3.  
Sample size  
For Part 2B, a total sample size of up to 680 subjects for the expansion cohorts was estimated to provide 
assessment of clinical activity of dostarlimab based on ORR. 
For Cohort A1, the null hypothesis that the true response rate is ≤20% (H0: p≤0.2) was tested against 
a one-sided alternative of ≥40% (Ha: p≥0.4). With 65 subjects treated, Cohort A1 has 92% power to 
rule out a ≤20% ORR (null hypothesis; expected ORR for conventional therapy) when the true ORR is 
40% at the 2.5% type I error rate (one-sided). Based on a report that 6 of 9 subjects with MSI-H EC 
achieved a clinical response following treatment with an anti-PD-1 antibody, the activity of dostarlimab 
in this subject population was expected to negate the necessity for a 2-stage design and, thus, there 
was no interim analysis in this cohort. 
Under protocol amendment 5, the sample size of Cohort A1 was increased to 100 subjects, with the 
potential for up to 165 subjects, which allowed the lower-limit boundary of the exact 95% CI excluding 
a response rate of 25% or less and assuming the observed ORR is 35%. 
Randomisation 
This was an uncontrolled Cohort Study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis for Study 4010-01-001 was descriptive in nature. In general, categorical data 
were summarized using number of patients (n), frequency, and percentages, with the denominator for 
percentages being the number of patients in the analysis set. Two-sided exact 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) based on the Clopper-Pearson method was provided to summarize the binomial 
proportion of the ORR/immune-related ORR (irORR) and DCR/immune-related DCR (irDCR) for both 
RECIST v1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) assessments, where applicable.

Three interim analyses were planned for dMMR/MSI-H patients from Cohorts A1 and F combined for 
administrative purposes. The interim analyses were to occur when combined enrollment in the 2 
cohorts reached approximately 100, 200, and 300 patients and enrolled patients had been followed up 
for at least 6 months 
Data presented for cohort A1 were based on a prospectively defined interim analysis conducted when 
200 patients enrolled in Cohort A1 and Cohort F (combined) had at least 6 months of follow up in order 
to allow sufficient time to assess tumour response and duration. 
Analysis Sets 
- Primary efficacy analysis set (RECIST 1.1 per BICR): All patients in Safety Analysis Set with 
measurable disease at baseline (defined at the existence of at least one target lesion at baseline tumor 
assessment by BICR) who have had the opportunity for at least 24 weeks of tumor assessment at the 
time of analysis. All patients included in the primary efficacy analysis set had a minimum follow-up 
period of 24 weeks from first dose, regardless of whether they had a post-treatment scan.  
Subjects who did not have a postbaseline radiographic tumour assessment; who received postbaseline 
antitumor treatments (including surgery or radiation to the tumour lesions) other than the study 
treatments prior to reaching a CR/irCR or PR/irPR; or who died, progressed, or dropped out for any 
reason prior to reaching a CR/irCR or PR/irPR were counted as non-responders in the assessment of 
ORR and irORR. 
- Secondary efficacy analysis set (irRECIST per Investigator assessment): All patients in Safety 
Analysis Set with measurable disease at baseline (defined at the existence of at least one target lesion 
at baseline tumor assessment by Investigator) who have had the opportunity for at least 24 weeks of 
tumor assessment at the time of analysis. All patients included in the secondary efficacy analysis set 
had a minimum follow-up period of 24 weeks from first dose, regardless of whether they had a post-
treatment scan.  
- Safety analysis set: All patients who received any amount of study drug prior to the data cut-off. 
Efficacy analyses 
The  analyses  for  the  efficacy  endpoints  using  RECIST  v1.1  and  irRECIST  were  based  on  the efficacy 
analysis  set.  The  analyses  for  OS  were  based  on  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  set.  The  key  efficacy 
analyses for Cohort A1 and Cohort A2 were ORR, DCR, DOR, and PFS by RECIST v1.1; irORR, irDCR, 
irDOR, and irPFS by irRECIST; and OS. 
Censoring rules for DOR and irDOR are presented below.

Conduct of the study 
Five global protocol amendments were implemented during the study, as follows: protocol version 2.0 
(amendment 1, dated 26 January 2016); protocol version 3.0 (amendment 2, dated 31 October 2016, 
The EC cohort was split into 2 cohorts based on MSI status, Assessment of tumour imaging from 
Cohort A1 and Cohort A2 by central radiologists based on RECIST v1.1); protocol version 4.1 
(amendment 3, dated 09 October 2017: inclusion of PRO, inclusion of an IA in Cohort A1 and F); 
protocol version 5.1 (amendment 4, dated 03 July 2018: increased enrolment in Cohort A2, stable 
patients were allow to prolong treatment) and protocol version 6.0 (amendment 5, dated 10 May 
2019: The definitions of Cohort A1 and Cohort A2 were updated such that tumour status requirements 
in the EC cohorts were revised to specify that subject eligibility can only be determined by MMR status 
based on results from IHC testing). 
Subjects participating in Part 2B of the study were enrolled only under protocol versions 3.0, 4.1, and 
5.1. No subjects were enrolled under protocol version 6.0 by the data cut-off date for this interim CSR. 
Protocol deviations 
In the safety analysis set, a total of 14 significant protocol deviations were recorded for 13 subjects 
(4.9%), including 7 significant protocol deviations in 6 subjects (5.8%) with dMMR EC. Most of these 
significant deviations were related to inclusion/exclusion criteria and included the following: 
• Deviation of inclusion criterion 2 (n=8), including progression following more than 2 prior lines of 
therapy (n=2 [2 subjects with dMMR EC]), no prior platinum doublet therapy (n=1 [1 subject with 
dMMR EC]), no central radiological confirmation of PD before dosing (n=1 [1 subject with dMMR EC]), 
no measurable disease at baseline (n=1 [1 subject with dMMR EC]), and subjects with carcinosarcoma 
(n=3 [3 subjects with MMR-proficient EC]). 
• Deviation of exclusion criterion 11: subject has not received transfusion of red blood cells within 3 
weeks prior to the first dose of study drug (n=1 [1 subject with MMR-proficient EC]). A second subject 
with dMMR EC also received transfusion of red blood cells within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study 
drug. 
• Deviation of exclusion criterion 13: no washout period of 21 days for paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment 
prior to dosing (n=1 [1 subject with dMMR EC]). 
• Subject received dostarlimab before central MSI status confirmation (n=1 [1 subject with MMR-
proficient EC]). 
• SAE was reported 12 days out of window (n=1 [1 subject with MMR-proficient EC]).

The primary efficacy analysis set for Cohort A1 was defined as all subjects in the safety analysis set 
with measurable disease at baseline (defined as the existence of at least 1 target lesion at baseline 
tumour assessment by BICR) who had the opportunity for at least 24 weeks of tumour assessment at 
the time of analysis; including patients who discontinued prematurely due to adverse events or disease 
progression (accounted as non-responders). It comprised 108 subjects: 106 subjects with dMMR EC by 
IHC and 2 subjects with MSI-H EC by NGS but unknown MMR status.  
As of the data cut-off date of 01 March 2020 for this interim CSR, 58 subjects were still on study 
treatment in Cohort A1. Enrolment is ongoing in Cohort A1.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
  Objective Response Rate 
Tumour response by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria for patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC in the primary 
efficacy analysis set is summarized in the tables below.  
Table 27: Tumour Response Summary-RECIST v1.1 Assessed by BICR in Patients with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC (Primary efficacy analysis set) – DCO 1 March 2020  
  Duration of Response 
At the time of data cut-off 01 March 2020, the median DOR had not been reached and ranged from 2.6 
to 28.1+, whereas 78.7% of the responders had a DOR of ≥6 months.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
  Disease Control Rate 
At the time of data cut-off of 01 March 2020, the DCR in patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC, including CR, 
PR, and SD, was 55.6% (95%CI: 45.7, 65.1). Stable disease (SD) was 12% (95%CI: 6.6, 19.7).  
 
Progression-free Survival 
At the time of data cut-off of 01 March 2020, just under half of the patients (47.2%) were censored, 
and a total of 57 PFS events had been observed. Based on these results, the probability of being free 
of PD at Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 was estimated to be 48.6%, 47.5%, and 47.5%, 
respectively.

  Overall Survival 
At the time of data cutoff of 01 March 2020, the median OS for patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC had not 
been reached and only 35 OS events had been observed. Based on these results, the probability of 
survival at Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 was estimated to be 81.3%, 75.5%, and 69.2%, 
respectively.

• 
Immune-related ORR 
Analyses  using  irRECIST  were  performed  using  the  secondary  efficacy  analysis  set  (N=116),  which 
included all patients with measurable disease at baseline (defined at the existence of at least 1 target 
lesion at baseline tumour assessment by the Investigator [as opposed to assessment by BICR, i.e., the 
primary efficacy analysis set (N=108)]) who received the first dose of dostarlimab at least 24 weeks 
prior to the data cutoff of 01 March 2020. 
At the time of data cutoff, the irORR was 44.8% (95%CI 35.6, 54.3), with 6.9% immune-related CRs 
(irCRs) and 37.9% immune-related PRs (irPRs). A total of 17.2% of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC had 
an immune-related BOR (irBOR) of immune-related SD (irSD), and 31.9% had an irBOR of immune-
related PD. 
• 
Immune-related DCR, PFS 
The irDCR in patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC, including irCR, irPR, and irSD, was 62.1%  
The median irPFS had not been reached. Just under half of the patients (44.8%) were censored at this 
time, and a total of 64 irPFS events had been observed. Based on these results, the probability of being 
progression free at Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 was estimated to be 54.3%, 50.4%, and 46.6%, 
respectively.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses  
  Subgroup Analyses of ORR (DCO 1 March 2020) 
ORR by MSI Status in Cohort A1 
As of the data cut-off date for this interim CSR, the ORR in subjects with MSI-H EC based on 
FoundationOne (NGS) test results (50.0%) was similar to that in subjects with dMMR EC based on local 
IHC test results (43.4%).  
ORR by Number of Prior Anticancer Therapy Regimens in Cohort A1 
The ORR in subjects with dMMR/MSI-H EC was similar in subjects who received 1 line of prior 
anticancer therapy (47.8%; 33/69) and subjects who received 2 or more lines of prior anticancer 
therapy (35.9%; 14/39). When data from subjects with MMR-unknown but MSI-H tumours were 
pooled with those of subjects with dMMR tumours, the results remained similar. 
ORR by Prior Radiation Therapy in Cohort A1 
The ORR in subjects with dMMR/MSI-H EC was similar in subjects who had received prior radiation 
(45.5%; N=77) and subjects who had not received prior radiation (38.7%; N=31).  
ORR by Prior Bevacizumab Use in Cohort A1 
A total of 5 subjects with dMMR/MSI-H EC with prior bevacizumab use and 103 subjects with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC without prior bevacizumab use were included in the primary efficacy analysis set. 
Evaluation of a potential effect of bevacizumab use on the dostarlimab ORR in subjects with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC was not possible due to the small sample size of 1 of the 2 subgroups.  
ORR by BOR from Last Platinum-containing Prior Anticancer Therapy in Cohort A1 
Among subjects with dMMR/MSI-H EC in the primary efficacy analysis set, 47 subjects had a BOR from 
the last platinum-containing prior anticancer therapy of CR or PR, 13 subjects had a BOR from the last 
platinum-containing prior anticancer therapy of SD, 39 subjects had a BOR from the last platinum-
containing prior anticancer therapy of PD, and 9 subjects were missing data on BOR from the last 
platinum-containing prior anticancer therapy. Due to the small number of subjects within each BOR 
from last platinum-containing prior anticancer therapy subgroup, a meaningful comparison based on 
BOR from last platinum-containing anticancer therapy could not be made.

ORR by Progression-free Interval from Last Platinum-containing Prior Anticancer Therapy in Cohort A1 
The ORR in subjects with dMMR/MSI-H EC was slightly higher in subjects who had a progression-free 
interval  from  the  last  platinum-containing  prior  anticancer  therapy  of  6  months  or  greater  (45.5%; 
N=66) than in subjects who had a progression-free interval of less than 6 months (37.5%; N=40).

Additional Exploratory Analyses (post hoc) 
PD-L1 tumour expression was assessed from an exploratory perspective using combined positive score 
(CPS) cut points of <1% and ≥1%. The testing was performed on samples from Cohorts A1 (dMMR/MSI-
H EC) and A2 (MMR proficient EC). All dMMR/MSI-H EC patients with viable samples were included. 
  ORR by PD-L1 Tumour Expression in Cohort A1 (DCO 01 March 2020)  
PD-L1 tumour expression was assessed using combined positive score (CPS) cut points of <1% and     
≥1%. Of the 108 patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC, 58 had a CPS of ≥1% with an ORR of 55.2% and 
23/108 patients had a CPS of <1% with an ORR of 30.4%. Twenty seven of the 108 patients had no 
available PD-L1 tumour expression data.

Additional sensitivity analysis 
The MAH initially presented results from an efficacy analysis set consisting of 105 patients who 
received the first dose of dostarlimab at least 24 weeks prior to the data cut-off (i.e. excluding 3 
patients who discontinued treatment due to AE or clinical progression before 24 weeks follow-up; data 
not shown). Sensitivity analyses were requested and presented as a side-by-side comparison in 
Table 34 per the requested exclusions denoted below.  
a)  Sensitivity Analysis 1 (SA-1) (n=108): tumour response summary in all participants in the 
safety analysis set (ITT) excluding the patients without measurable disease at baseline and 
who have not had the opportunity to have 24 weeks follow up, but including those patients 
who discontinued treatment due to AE or clinical progression as non-responders. 
b)  Sensitivity Analysis 2-A (SA-2A) (n=117):  All patients in the safety analysis set (ITT) 
excluding only the 12 patients who have not had the opportunity for at least 24 weeks follow 
up and were still on treatment at data cut-off. Patients who discontinued due to AEs before 
24 weeks (n=2), those who were assessed as PD before 24 weeks (n=1), and patients with 
without measurable disease at baseline assessed by BICR (n=9) are counted as non-
responders. 
c)  Sensitivity Analysis 2-B (SA-2B) (n=117):  All patients in the safety analysis set (ITT) 
excluding only the 12 patients who have not had the opportunity for at least 24 weeks follow 
up and were still on treatment at data cut-off (n=117). Patients who discontinued due to AEs 
before 24 weeks (n=2) or were assessed as having PD before 24 weeks (n=1) were counted as 
non-responders. Patients with non-measurable disease at baseline assessed by BICR (n=9) 
were included in the denominator, but those who were assessed as CR were counted as 
responders in the numerator (i.e. even if they were considered not to have measurable disease 
by the BICR team, but the disease then fully disappeared according to the investigator).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Of the 108 patients treated with dostarlimab in the efficacy population, 50.0 % were older than 65 years. 
Consistent results were observed in the elderly population, where the ORR by BICR (95% CI) was 42.6 
% (29.2 %, 56.8 %) in patients ≥ 65 years.

Supportive study(ies) 
Results  of  Study  4010-01-001  Part  2B  –  Cohort  F  Patients  with  Tumours  Classified  as 
dMMR/MSI-H and/or POLE-mutated Non EC (DCO 8 July 2019) 
Cohort F was constituted by patients with recurrent or advanced non-endometrial dMMR/MSI-H or 
POLE-mutated solid tumours, who had PD following up to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for recurrent 
or advanced (≥Stage IIIB) disease; and who had no alternative treatment options. 
The safety analysis set of cohort F included 109 patients. Of these, 2 patients had POLE mutated non-
EC.  
At the time of data cut-off of 8 July 2019, 22.9% of patients had discontinued treatment, and 11.0% 
had discontinued the study. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was confirmed PD 
(15 patients), and the most common reason for study discontinuation was death (8 patients). 
Of the 109 patients in the safety analysis set, 50 patients (45.9%) had received at least one dose of 
dostarlimab and had 6 months of follow up data and were therefore included in the primary efficacy 
analysis set. 
Of these 50 patients, 31 (62%) had colorectal cancer, 8 (16%) small intestine cancer, 4 (8%) gastric 
cancer, 2 (4%) ovarian cancer and 1 patient (2%) each with genital neoplasm female, pancreatic 
carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma-sarcoma. 2 patients (4%) had other tumours.

At the data cut-off, confirmed responses had occurred in 22 out of 50 patients, for an ORR of 44% 
(95% CI 30.0, 58.7) and included 8.0% CRs and 36.0% PRs. Clinical activity was consistent across 
CRC and other tumour types (ORR 43.3%, and 44.4%, respectively), and comparable to MMR-selected 
EC in cohort A1 (43.1%). 
At the time of data cut-off, 20 out of 22 patients were on ongoing response, so the median DOR had 
not been reached, ranging from 2.76+ to 13.83+ months. 
At the time of data cut-off, the median PFS in patients with dMMR/MSI-H non-EC was 11.0 months. A 
total of 31 patients with dMMR/MSI-H non-EC (62.0%) were censored at this time, and 19 PFS events 
had been observed. 
At data cut-off, only 8 OS events had occurred in all 109 patients. 
Results  of  Study 4010-01-001  Part  2B: Cohort A2  Patients  with  EC (proficient  MMR/MSS)  - 
(DCO 8 July 2020) 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics in Cohort A2 
For subjects with MMR-proficient EC in the primary efficacy population, the median age was 66.0 years 
(range: 30, 86 years). Most subjects were White. Median weight was 74.90 kg (range: 45.8, 182.3 
kg), and median BMI was 28.96 kg/m2 (range: 18.3, 61.6 kg/m2). At study entry, 49.5% of subjects 
with MMR-proficient EC had an ECOG performance status of 0, and 50.5% of the subjects had an ECOG 
performance status of 1. When demographics data from subjects with MMR-unknown but MSS tumours 
were pooled with those of subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remain similar. 
The most common histology grade at diagnosis in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was Grade 3 
(61.0%), and just over half of all subjects had disease with unfavourable histologic characteristics, 
such as serous carcinoma (36.2%), clear cell carcinoma (7.6%), or mixed carcinoma (7.6%). Most 
subjects had FIGO Stage IV (71.4%) disease at the time of study enrollment. When data on disease 
characteristics from subjects with MMRunknown but MSS tumours were pooled with those of subjects 
with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained similar. 
All subjects with MMR-proficient EC had received prior anticancer treatment (100.0%), with 54.3% of 
subjects having received any prior adjuvant/neo-adjuvant anticancer treatment. A total of 43.8% of 
subjects had 1 anticancer prior regimen and 2 prior regimens each. Less than 13% of subjects with 
MMR-proficient EC had received 3 or more prior regimens. Approximately two-thirds of subjects with 
MMR-proficient EC had received prior regimens for metastatic disease. 95.2% of subjects had prior 
surgery and 65.7% had prior anticancer radiotherapy. The most common BOR from the last platinum-
containing anticancer therapy was PD (27.6% of subjects with MMR-proficient EC), followed by CR and 
PR (20.0% of subjects with MMR-proficient EC each). The median progression-free interval from the 
last platinum-containing anticancer therapy was 8.41 months (Q1, Q3: 4.4, 11.8 months). When prior 
anticancer treatment data from subjects with MMR-unknown but MSS tumours were pooled with those 
of subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained similar. 
Analysis of Efficacy in Cohort A2 
The ORR in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was 9.5%, with 1 subject having a BOR of CR and 9 
subjects having a BOR of PR. A BOR of SD was observed in 26 subjects (24.8%) (). A total of 56 of 
subjects had a BOR of PD (53.3%). BOR was not assessed in 13 subjects (12.4%). When data from 
subjects with MMR-unknown but MSS tumours were pooled with those of subjects with MMR-proficient 
tumours, the results remained similar, with an ORR of 10.0% (MMR-proficient/MSS EC) vs 9.5% (MMR-
proficient EC), respectively.

The majority of the subjects with MMR-proficient EC with an objective response (70.0% of responders) 
had an ongoing response at the time of the data cutoff. A median DOR in these subjects was therefore 
not evaluable (NE). The DOR in these subjects ranged from 1.41+ to 22.21+ months, with DOR ≥6 
months in 5 subjects (50.0% of responders). 
The DCR in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was 34.3%, with 1 subject having a BOR of CR, 9 subjects 
having a BOR of PR, and 26 subjects having a BOR of SD. When data from subjects with MMR-
unknown but MSS tumours were pooled with those of subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the 
results remained similar, with a DCR of 33.6% (MMR-proficient/MSS EC) vs 34.3% (MMR-proficient 
EC), respectively. 
The irORR in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was 11.4%, with 3 subjects having an irBOR of irCR and 
9 subjects having an irBOR of irPR. Response was ongoing in 8 subjects (66.7% of responders) at the 
time of the data cutoff. An irBOR of irSD was observed in 29 subjects with MMR-proficient EC (27.6%). 
A total of 46 subjects with MMR-proficient EC had an irBOR of irPD (43.8%). irBOR was not assessed in 
14 subjects (13.3%) and was NE in 4 subjects (3.8%). When data from subjects with MMR-unknown but 
MSS  tumours were pooled  with  those of  subjects  with  MMR-proficient  tumours, the  results  remained 
similar. 
The majority of the subjects with MMR-proficient EC with a response by irRECIST (66.7% of responders) 
had an ongoing response at the time of the data cutoff. A median irDOR in these subjects was therefore 
NE. The irDOR in subjects with MMR-proficient EC ranged from 1.41+ to 22.21+ months, with 5 subjects 
(41.7% of responders) having an irDOR ≥6 months.  
The  irDCR  in  subjects  with  MMR-proficient  EC  was  39.0%,  with  irBOR  of  irCR  in  3  subjects,  irPR  in 
9 subjects, and irSD in 29 subjects. When data from subjects with MMR-unknown but MSS tumours were 
pooled with those of subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained similar. 
A total of 87 PFS events were observed, and the median PFS in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was 
2.7 months. When data from subjects with MMR-unknown but MSS tumours were pooled with those of 
subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained similar, with a median PFS of 2.7 months in 
subjects with MMR-proficient/MSS EC and MMR-proficient EC. 
A total of 81 irPFS events were observed, and the median irPFS in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was 
2.8 months. When data from subjects with MMR-unknown but MSS tumours were pooled with those of 
subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained similar. 
Most subjects with MMR-proficient EC in the primary efficacy analysis set (57.1%) were censored at the 
time of the data cutoff. The median OS in these subjects was 16.0 months.  
Subgroup Analyses in Cohort A2 
At the time of data cutoff, the ORR in subjects with MMR-proficient EC was higher in subjects who had 
received prior radiation (13.0%; N=69) than in subjects who had not received prior radiation (2.8%; 
N=36).  When  data  from  subjects  with  MMR-unknown  but  MSS  tumours  were  pooled  with  those  of 
subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained similar (12.7% [9/71] vs 5.1% [2/39]). 
No  effect of  local  (IHC) versus central  (FoundationOne  NGS)  test  results,  number of  prior  anticancer 
therapy regimens, or duration of progression-free interval from last platinum-containing prior anticancer 
therapy  was observed.  A  total  of  6 subjects with  MMR-proficient  EC  with  prior bevacizumab  use  and 
99 subjects with MMR-proficient EC without prior bevacizumab use were included in the primary efficacy 
analysis set. There were few subjects with prior bevacizumab use to determine whether ORR is affected 
by prior bevacizumab use. Due to the small number of subjects within each BOR from last platinum-
containing  prior  anticancer  therapy  subgroup,  a  meaningful  comparison  based  on  BOR  from  last 
platinum-containing anticancer therapy could not be made. When data from subjects with MMR-unknown

but MSS tumours were pooled with those of subjects with MMR-proficient tumours, the results remained 
similar. 
A median DOR was not reached in the majority of subgroups. A comparison of DOR range between the 
subgroups  was  hampered  by  the  small  sample  size  of  subjects  with  MMR-proficient  EC  who  had  an 
objective response (N=10). No evaluation of a potential effect of these variables on the DOR or DOR 
range was performed in subjects with MMR-proficient/MSS EC. 
The outcomes to the last platinum-based regimen were as follows: for Cohort A1 ORR 44.5% (CR 18.1%, 
PR 26.4%), SD 18.1%, PD 15.3%, median PFS 6.37 months (95%CI 4, 12 months) vs Cohort A2 ORR 
40.0% (CR 20%, PR 20%), SD 32.4%, PD 27.6%, median PFS 8.4 months (95%CI 4, 11.8 months).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted to support the claimed indication is Study 4010-01-001 
(GARNET), a multicentre, open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation study with expansion cohorts in patients 
with recurrent or advanced solid tumours who have limited available treatment options. This was a 
multinational clinical trial, with centres participating from USA, Canada, and Europe.  
Study 4010-01-001 was conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, a modified 3+3 design was used to evaluate 
ascending weight-based doses of dostarlimab administered by IV infusion. Part 2A evaluated the safety 
and tolerability of 2 fixed doses of dostarlimab. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the 
recommended therapeutic dose was determined to be 500 mg Q3W for the first 4 cycles followed by 
1,000 mg Q6W for all subsequent cycles. This dosing schedule was used in Part 2B and thus for all 
patient efficacy data reported in this report.  
Selection of the recommended therapeutic dosing regimen (500 mg Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 
1,000 mg Q6W for all subsequent cycles) was based on the efficacy, safety, receptor occupancy, and 
population PK analysis of dostarlimab observed to date. Receptors are fully occupied at all dose levels 
studied over the entire dosing interval, including over the entire dosing interval following 500 mg Q3W 
and 1,000 mg Q6W dosing, the 2 components of the RTD regimen. The exposure response curve is flat 
for both safety and efficacy. Therefore, the proposed dose regimen is considered acceptable. 
The main efficacy data supporting the claimed indication come from Cohort A1 in Part 2B of the study, 
which includes patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC endometrial cancer.   
This was an open-label, multicentre, single-arm cohort study. The primary objective of the analysis for 
Cohort A1 was the evaluation of the antitumor activity of dostarlimab. The primary endpoints were the 
proportion of ORR and DOR by BICR using RECIST v1.1. and the secondary endpoints included DCR, 
PFS, OS, irORR, irPFS, irDOR, and exploratory PROs. 
Cohort A1 from part 2B recruited patients with MSI-H endometrial cancer, who have progressed on or 
after at least 1, but no more than 2 lines of anti-cancer therapy (of which, at least 1 must be a platinum-
based therapy). All EC histological types were allowed, except sarcomas. The study was conducted in 
accordance with the ICH for GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 2008) and do not raise any 
particular concerns.  
It is noted that patients with the following status were excluded from the GARNET study and therefore 
no efficacy data is available in these patients (see SmPC section 4.4): ECOG baseline performance score 
≥ 2; uncontrolled central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis; other malignancies 
within the last 2 years; immunodeficiency or receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days; active 
HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection; active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the 
past 2 years excluding replacement therapy; history of interstitial lung disease; or receiving live vaccine 
within 14 days.  
ORR and DOR based on blinded independent central review using RECIST 1.1 criteria were selected as 
primary endpoints providing a reliable estimate of the antitumor activity of dostarlimab in the context of 
a single arm trial. Secondary endpoints including DCR, PFS, OS, as well as irORR, irDOR, irPFS, plus QoL 
assessments are considered relevant endpoints.  
Overall, the main limitations of the study are the non-randomised nature and the absence of control arm 
leading  to  uncertainties  on  the  actual  benefit  in  clinically  relevant  treatment  outcomes,  i.e.  OS. 
Furthermore, preliminary efficacy remains limited to 108 patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced EC. These 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 113/176 
 
 
  
 
 
limitations could be acceptable in the context of a CMA based on the observed effect on ORR when it is 
considered outstanding and provided all the criteria for the CMA are fulfilled (see further discussion under 
efficacy data and additional analyses). 
In addition, there were uncertainties related to the prognostic and/or predictive value of dMMR/MSI-H 
biomarker in the EC population. Data presented indicate that the presence of dMMR/MSI-H is a predictive 
biomarker  of  response  to  immune  therapy.  Available  evidence  also  suggests  that  the  response  to 
chemotherapy in these patients would be consistent to that seen for patients with MMR proficient status 
(see under efficacy data and additional analyses). 
Local dMMR/MSI-H test results were used for patient selection for efficacy in the GARNET study. 
Further information related to the methodology used for dMMR/MSI-H alteration diagnosis was 
provided. While most patients in GARNET were enrolled based on IHC testing, reflecting clinical care, 
all the different platforms are testing the same phenotype (dMMR/MSI-H) and any of them are 
considered valid tests.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study population is considered a well-defined, homogeneous, and pre-treated population 
representative of the intended target as defined by the baseline demographic and disease 
characteristics.  
An administrative interim analysis was planned to occur when the combined enrolment in cohorts A1 
and F of GARNET reached 100 subjects who had been followed for at least 24 weeks.  
The applicant submitted results from 129 patients (cohort A1) with cut-off date of 1 March 2020 
constituting the intended population for the proposed therapeutic indication.  
Out of the safety dataset (N=129), only patients with measurable disease at baseline and who had 
been followed for at least 24 weeks (or prematurely excluded due to AEs or disease progression) were 
selected for the efficacy dataset of N=108.  
In patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC from Study 4010-01-001 Cohort A1, the ORR as assessed based on 
RECIST 1.1 by BICR was 43.5% (47 of 108 patients), 95% CI (34.0, 53.4), with 10.2% CRs (11 of 108 
patients).  
At the time of the data cut-off date of 01 March 2020, the median DOR had not been reached, and 
78.3 % of responders had a DOR ≥6 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the probability of 
maintaining a response for 6, and 12 months in patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC was 97.9% and 90.9%, 
respectively. At the time of the data cut-off date, 89.4 % of responders had an ongoing response. 
DCR (BOR of CR, PR, or SD) was observed in 55.6% (60 of 108 patients) of all patients with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC.  
In terms of progression free survival, 47.2% had no PFS event at the data cut-off. Based on these 
results, the probability of being free of PD at Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 was estimated to be 
48.6%, 47.5%, and 47.5%, respectively. 
The majority of patients in the primary efficacy analysis set did not have an OS event (67.6%), and 
the median OS was not reached. Based on these results, the probability of survival at Month 6, Month 
9, and Month 12 was estimated to be 81.3%, 75.5%, and 69.2%, respectively. 
Secondary endpoints according to irRECIST based on Investigator assessment (based on secondary 
analysis set, N=116 patients) were consistent to those primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021

Subgroup analyses defined by tumour MSI status, number of prior anticancer therapy regimens, prior 
radiation therapy, prior bevacizumab use, BOR from last platinum-containing prior anticancer therapy, 
and progression-free interval from last platinum containing prior anticancer therapy were conducted.  
Overall, results of subgroup analyses for ORR and DOR in the overall population of patients with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC were consistent with the primary efficacy results. Results were also consistent across 
the relevant subgroups, the only exception being the subgroup of patients with ECOG PS 0 or 1 where 
a considerable difference in ORR was observed between the ECOG PS 0 (67% in 42 patients) and 
ECOG PS 1 (30% in 63 patients) subgroups in patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC. Improved efficacy 
performance in more fit patients is not unexpected. However, the results should be interpreted with 
caution in view of the limited sample size.   
Furthermore, of the 515 patients treated with dostarlimab monotherapy, 50.7% were under 65 years, 
37.9% were 65-75 years, and 11.5% were 75 years or older. Efficacy results by age range of patients 
separately were requested and showed consistent tumour responses across the spectrum of age.  
The efficacy of dostarlimab in children and adolescents aged under 18 years has not been established. 
No data are available (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The prevalence of PD-L1 expression in dMMR EC (A1) and overall 2L EC population (A1+A2) were 
evaluated by pooling the data from patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC (Cohort A1 of Study 4010-01-001) 
and patients with MMR proficient/microsatellite stable EC (Cohort A2 of Study 4010-01-001) (data not 
shown). Preliminary analysis suggested that PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1%) was more frequently seen in 
dMMR compared to MMR proficient EC. 
PD-L1 IHC results were available for 81 out of 108 patients (75%) from the primary efficacy analysis 
set from cohort A1 (dMMR/MSI-H EC) and for 104 out of 156 patients (67%) from cohort A2 
(MMRp/MSS EC) (data not shown). Subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression using the threshold of 1% 
(data cut-off 1 March 2020) showed that PD-L1 positivity drives the ORR benefit: 55.2% vs. 30.4% for 
A1 and 20% vs. 4% for A2 in the PD-L1 positive vs the PD-L1 negative population. Interestingly, when 
the whole EC population is pooled (n=261), a similar proportion of ORR benefit is seen from MMR/MS 
selection [45% for dMMR/MSI-H (n=108) vs. 14% for MMRp/MSS (n=156)] or PD-L1 selection [38% 
for ≥1% (n=115) vs. 13% for <1% (n=68)]. This observation was further supported by the logistic 
regression model (data not shown) that evaluated the statistical association between MMR/MS status 
or PD-L1 status. Regarding alternative cut-off points for PD-L1 status, it is agreed that the ROC curves 
suggest that the optimal threshold for predicting efficacy benefit in terms of response is 1%. 
Overall, although higher tumour responses were observed in patients with higher PD-L1 expression, 
clinical activity was observed regardless of tumour PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) by IHC (see 
Table 32).  
The sensitivity analyses conducted applying more conservative censoring rules ( 
Table ) provided consistent results for tumour responses to those initially seen, addressing the doubts 
raised on the selection of the evaluated population and the interpretation of the results.  
In conclusion, ORR results are considered outstanding in patients with recurrent or advanced 
dMMR/MSI-H EC previously treated with a platinum-containing regimen, given that currently available 
systemic therapy options for recurrent or advanced EC in the second-line setting provide very limited 
overall clinical activity and are invariably short-lived, with objective response rates (ORRs) of 
approximately 7% to 14% and median overall survival (OS) of 6 to 11 months.  
However, it was doubted if these same modest results observed in the general EC population are 
expected in the subset of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC patients when treated with standard 
treatments or whether better outcomes might be expected. Based on previous knowledge from other 
Assessment report

anti-PD1 inhibitors and on tumour responses observed in the different Cohorts of GARNET Study, it is 
unquestioned that the presence of dMMR/MSI-H is a biomarker predictive of treatment outcomes to 
dostarlimab.  
In order to investigate whether dMMR/MSI-H is a prognostic or predictive marker of response to 
standard chemotherapy, the applicant conducted a systematic review aimed to evaluate the available 
clinical study evidence in the treatment of recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (data not shown). 
Despite the number of studies investigating the prognostic effect of both MMR and MSI status on 
survival and disease progression, results varied, and there was no strong evidence to suggest that 
either dMMR or MSI-H status has a significant positive or negative prognostic value in endometrial 
cancer patients.  
Regarding the predictive effect, evidence presented from Cohort A1 (dMMR/MSI-H) and Cohort A2 
(MMR-proficient/MSS EC) shows consistent tumour responses from patients who had received 
platinum-based chemotherapy prior to receiving dostarlimab in both Cohorts (Cohort A1 ORR 44.5% vs 
Cohort A2 ORR 40%), with consistent Progression Free intervals following last platinum-based regimen 
(Cohort A1 median PFS 6.37 (95% CI 4, 12) vs Cohort A2 median PFS 8.4 months (95% CI 4, 11.8), 
thus, regardless of the presence of the MMR/MS status. Even if these two cohorts are not fully 
comparable with respect to some baseline disease characteristics, in general both are rather similar 
and represent a heavily pretreated recurrent or advanced EC population previously treated with 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Results suggest that the presence of MMR-d/MSI-H is not predictive of 
responses to standard chemotherapy in previous lines. Available literature also suggests that the same 
applies for chemotherapy in second line. In conclusion, based on available evidence it appears 
reasonable to conclude that the modest tumour responses and short survival in the overall EC 
population reported in the literature for available chemotherapies in 2nd line can be applied to the 
subset of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC.  
With this in mind, the observed tumour responses with dostarlimab are well above those expected with 
standard treatment and are considered clinically relevant in this condition. However, more 
comprehensive clinical data are still considered needed in order to firmly conclude on the benefit of 
dostarlimab in the claimed indication.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
As discussed above, there are limitations related to the efficacy of dostarlimab in the claimed indication 
due to the uncontrolled nature of the pivotal trial, the limited sample size and data immaturity. These 
limitations hamper the assessment of clinical benefit in terms of relevant clinical outcomes. Therefore, 
additional clinical data should be provided in order to confirm the benefit of dostarlimab in the claimed 
indication. In the context of a conditional MA, updated results from study GARNET (Cohort A1) will be 
provided  by  31  December  2022  to  confirm  the  benefits  observed  with  dostarlimab  in  the  target 
population. At that time, data from at least 131 patients with measurable disease followed for at least 
12 months from the onset of response will be available (SOB). 
Furthermore,  data  from  study  4010-03-001  (RUBY),  a  randomised  double-blind  Phase  III  study  of 
dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin plus paclitaxel considered the SOC) versus 
chemotherapy alone, in chemotherapy-naïve subjects with recurrent or primary advanced endometrial 
cancer will be provided. This study is expected to include approximately 25% of patients with dMMR/MSI-
H EC. Patients will be stratified by MMR/MS status. The results of the primary analysis of progression-
free survival (PFS), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) (N=470) together with 
the  results  of  the  interim  OS  analysis  will  be  submitted  by  31  December  2022  (SOB).  The  final  OS 
analysis is currently foreseen for 2024 (REC).

Although  this  study  is  assessing  dostarlimab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  a  prior  line  of 
treatment in EC patients, the results from this study are expected to provide further evidence of safety 
and efficacy of dostarlimab in the treatment of MSI-H endometrial cancer (EC). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
Endometrial cancer recurring after first-line chemotherapy is largely a chemoresistant disease. Results 
from available literature suggest that single agent chemotherapy provides ORRs of approximately 7% 
to 14% and median overall survival of 6 to 11 months in 2nd line therapy. There is a clear unmet 
medical need in this population for which there is currently no approved therapies in the EU. 
Preliminary efficacy data from cohort A1 of trial GARNET showed a benefit in terms of ORR and DOR 
from dostarlimab in the advanced dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer setting: ORR of 43.5% and 78.3% 
of patients with a DOR of ≥6 months. Dostarlimab treatment compares favourably to available, 
unapproved therapies commonly used in this patient population, for whom consistent results can 
reasonably be anticipated in the subset of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC.  
Taking into account the disease setting, the limited treatment options available and the size and 
duration of the observed anti-tumoral effect, dostarlimab is considered to provide a clinically relevant 
benefit for adult patients with recurrent or advanced mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI-H) endometrial cancer (EC) that have progressed on or following prior treatment 
with a platinum-containing regimen. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA:  
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with mismatch 
repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced 
endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-
containing regimen the MAH should submit updated results of the GARNET study, Cohort A1, 
including at least 131 patients with measurable disease followed for at least 12 months from 
the onset of response. The CSR should be submitted by 31 December 2022.  
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with mismatch repair 
deficient  (dMMR)/microsatellite  instability-high  (MSI-H)  recurrent  or  advanced  endometrial 
cancer  (EC)  that  has  progressed  on  or  following  prior  treatment  with  a  platinum-containing 
regimen  the MAH  should  submit  the  results of  the phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind study 
RUBY, comparing the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy to 
chemotherapy alone in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer who have not 
received prior systemic anticancer therapy for recurrent or advanced disease. The CSR should 
be submitted by 31 December 2022).

2.6.  Clinical safety  
Safety data for dostarlimab are organized into 2 groups: 
• Patients with dMMR and dMMR/MSI-H Endometrial Cancer (Cohort A1; monotherapy) 
• Patients treated with dostarlimab at the recommended therapeutic dose (RTD) (monotherapy): the 
“RTD” pool comprises patients who were treated with the 500 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses 
followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks (Q6W) regimen (GARNET Part 2B Schema, see Figure 34). 
Patient exposure 
Endometrial Cancer monotherapy group 
Extent of Exposure 
Treatment exposure for patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC is summarised in Table 37 (data cut-off date of 
1 March 2020). The overall median treatment duration for participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC was 26.0 
weeks (range: 3 to 139 weeks). Sixty-three participants (48.8%) were exposed to dostarlimab 
monotherapy for at least 24 weeks, whereas 40 participants (31.0%) and 23 participants (17.8%) 
were exposure for at least 48 and 72 weeks, respectively.

Adverse events 
Endometrial Cancer monotherapy group 
Adverse events 
Most participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC experienced at least 1 TEAE (95.3%). Treatment-related AEs 
refer to any TEAE assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment (“Related,” “Possibly 
Related,” or missing). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 63.6% of participants. The majority 
of TEAEs were not severe or serious and did not require treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
TEAEs leading to death were reported in 5 participants (3.9%).

Note: For each category, participants were included only once even if they experienced multiple events in that 
category. AE severity was graded using CTCAE v4.03. TEAEs are new AEs that began, or any pre-existing 
condition that worsened in severity, after at least 1 dose of study treatment was administered and throughout the 
treatment period until 90 days after end of treatment visit (or until the start of alternate anticancer therapy, 
whichever occurred earlier). AE severity was graded using CTCAE v4.03. 
TEAEs reported for participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC are summarised in Table 42 (by SOC and PT; 
≥10% of participants). 
More than half of the participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC had an event in the SOC of General disorders 
and administration site conditions (64.3%), with fatigue and asthenia being the most frequently 
reported TEAEs (≥20%), and/or the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders (62.8%), with nausea and 
diarrhoea being the most frequently reported TEAEs.  
Overall, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥20%) in participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC were 
nausea, diarrhoea, anaemia, fatigue, and asthenia. These common TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity in most participants for whom the TEAEs were reported, with the exception of anaemia, for 
which 19 participants (14.7%) had Grade 3 events. Of the other most frequently reported TEAEs, 3 
participants (2.3%) had Grade 3 TEAEs of diarrhoea, 1 participant (0.8%) each had Grade 3 TEAEs of 
asthenia and fatigue, and no participant had TEAEs of Grade ≥3 nausea. For none of the participants 
who had these most frequently reported TEAEs, the event was Grade 4 or Grade 5.

Immune-Related AEs (irAEs) 
irAEs experienced by patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC are summarised below.  
In patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC, 47 patients (36.4%) reported irAEs. The most frequently reported 
irAEs (>5%) were diarrhoea (8.5%) and hypothyroidism (7.0%) (Table 27). The median time to onset 
across events reported in ≥2% patients varied from 19 days (for pruritus) to 380 days (for 
colitis).Almost half of the patients required treatment with immune modulatory medication (IMM) to 
manage the irAEs and most of them were resolved at the time of the data cut-off date.

Note: AEs are coded using MedDRA version 23.0. irAEs are identified as any Grade ≥2 AEs based on prespecified preferred terms. 
** If a patient experienced the same event multiple times, the highest grade was taken. If a patient experienced the same event with the same grade more than once, the 
one that was treated with IMM was taken. If a patient experienced the same event with the same grade more than once and treated with the same IMM or no treatment, 
the longer duration to recovery will be taken.

Patients Treated with Dostarlimab at the RTD 
Adverse Events 
TEAEs reported for participants treated with dostarlimab at the RTD are summarised in Table 45. 
Most participants who received dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD experienced at least 
1 TEAE (97.9%). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 67.2% of participants. The majority of 
TEAEs were not serious and did not require treatment interruption or discontinuation. SAEs were 
reported in 39.4% of participants. irAEs were reported in 34.8% of participants, and infusion-
related reactions were reported in 1.4% of participants. 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were observed in 9.5% of participants. TEAEs 
that led to study treatment interruption were reported in 22.5% of participants.

Abbreviations:  AE=adverse event; IMM=immune-modulatory medication; irAE=immune-related adverse event; NE=not evaluable. 
Note: AEs are coded using MedDRA version 23.0. irAEs are identified as any Grade ≥2 AEs based on prespecified preferred terms. 
** If a patient experienced the same event multiple times, the highest grade was taken. If a patient experienced the same event with the same grade more than once, the one that was treated with IMM 
was taken. If a patient experienced the same event with the same grade more than once and treated with the same IMM or no treatment, the longer duration to recovery will be taken. 
Percentages are calculated using 'No. of patients with irAE' as denominator. IMM with or without Resolved columns % are calculated using n(%).

Immune-related pneumonitis 
Immune-related pneumonitis occurred in 7 (1.4 %) of 515 patients, including grade 2 (1.2 %) and 
grade 3  (0.2 %)  pneumonitis.  Pneumonitis  led  to  discontinuation  of  dostarlimab  in  3  (0.6 %) 
patients. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≥ 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in all 
7 patients experiencing pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 6 (85.7 %) patients. 
Immune-related colitis 
Colitis occurred in 8 (1.6 %) patients, including grade 2 (1.0 %) and grade 3 (0.6 %) colitis. Colitis 
did not lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab in any patients. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 
≥ 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 2 (28.6 %) patients. Colitis resolved in 6 (75.0 %) 
patients experiencing colitis. 
Immune-related hepatitis 
Hepatitis  occurred  in  1  (0.2 %) patient,  which  was grade 3.  Systemic  corticosteroids  (prednisone 
≥ 40 mg  per  day  or  equivalent)  were  required.  Hepatitis  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of 
dostarlimab and resolved. 
Immune-mediated endocrinopathies 
Hypothyroidism occurred in 37 (7.2 %) patients, all of which were grade 2. Hypothyroidism did not 
lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab and resolved in 13 (35.1 %) patients.  
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 10 (1.9 %) patients, including grade 2 (1.7 %) and grade 3 (0.2 %). 
Hyperthyroidism did not lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab and resolved in 8 (80 %) patients.  
Thyroiditis occurred in 2 (0.4 %) patients; both were grade 2. Neither event of thyroiditis resolved; 
there were no discontinuations of dostarlimab due to thyroiditis. 
Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 7 (1.4 %) patients, including grade 2 (0.8 %), and grade 3 (0.6 %). 
Adrenal insufficiency resulted in discontinuation of dostarlimab in 1 (0.2 %) patient and resolved in 
2 (28.6 %) patients.  
Immune-mediated nephritis  
Nephritis,  including  tubulointerstitial  nephritis,  occurred  in  3  (0.6 %)  patients;  all  were  grade 2. 
Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≥ 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 2 (66.7 %) 
patients experiencing nephritis. Nephritis led to discontinuation of dostarlimab in 1 (0.2 %) patient 
and resolved in 2 of 3 (66.7 %) patients.  
Immune-related rash 
Immune-related rash (rash, rash maculo-papular, rash macular, rash pruritic, pemphigoid) occurred 
in 17 (3.3 %) patients, including Grade 3 in 6 (1.2 %) patients receiving dostarlimab. The median 
time to onset of rash was 41 days (range 2 days to 407 days). Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 
≥ 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 5 (29 %) patients experiencing rash. Rash did not 
lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab and resolved in 13 (76.5 %) patients.   
Immune-related arthralgia 
Immune related arthralgia occurred in 21 (4.1 %) patients. Grade 3 immune related arthralgia was 
reported in 3 (0.6 %) patients receiving dostarlimab. The median time to onset of arthralgia was 87 
days (range 1 day to 783 days). Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≥ 40 mg per day or equivalent) 
were required in 2 (9.5 %) patients experiencing arthralgia. Arthralgia did not lead to discontinuation 
of dostarlimab and resolved in 8 (38 %) patients experiencing arthralgia.

Subgroup Analysis of Treatment-emergent irAEs 
The incidence of irAEs was analysed by subgroup, defined by sex, age, race, ethnicity, BMI, region, 
ECOG performance status, baseline kidney function, baseline hepatic function, prior anticancer 
treatment, prior radiotherapy, prior chemotherapy, and prior immunotherapy. A comparison of irAE 
incidence in participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent between the subgroups is 
hampered by the small sample size (≤30 participants) of some of the subgroups. In subgroups of 
sufficient size for comparison (>30 participants), the incidence of irAEs was generally similar, with 
the following exceptions: 
• 
Participants from Western Europe (N=299) had a lower incidence of any irAE than 
participants from North America (N=198) (29.1% vs 40.9%). This is driven at least in part by 
differences in the incidence of diarrhoea (Western Europe 4.3%; North America 10.6%). 
• 
Participants with normal kidney function (N=230) and mildly impaired kidney function 
(N=199) had a lower incidence of any irAE than participants with moderately impaired kidney 
function (N=83) (30.0% and 35.7% vs 45.8%, respectively). The difference seems to be primarily 
driven by differences in the incidence of blood creatinine increased (normal kidney function 0.9%; 
mildly impaired kidney function 3.5%; moderately impaired kidney function 12.0%). 
Infusion-Related Reactions  
A total of 7 participants (1.4%) treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD reported 
infusion-related reaction TEAEs. These infusion-related reaction TEAEs were infusion-related 
reaction (6 participants [1.2%]) and hypersensitivity (1 participant [0.2%]). 
Of the 7 participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent who experienced  infusion-related 
reaction TEAEs, 1 participant (14.3%) with a Grade ≥3 event was treated with an IMM. The event 
resolved after 1.0 day. Six participants (85.7%) were not treated with an IMM. The events in these 
participants resolved after a median time to resolution of 1.0 day.  
Grade 2 infusion related reaction TEAEs was reported in 1.2% of patients. Grade ≥3 infusion-
related reaction TEAEs were reported in 1 participant (0.2%), infusion-related reaction TEAEs 
leading to treatment interruption were reported in 4 participants (0.8%), and infusion-related 
reaction TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment were reported in 2 
participants (0.4%). The 2 participants with an infusion-related reaction leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment had treatment interrupted due to the infusion-related reaction 
prior to permanently discontinuing treatment. 
No infusion-related reaction SAEs or infusion-related reaction TEAEs leading to death were 
reported. 
All patients recovered from the infusion-related reaction.

Grade ≥3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported for ≥1.5% of participants treated with dostarlimab at the RTD are 
summarised in Table 48. 
A total of 259 participants (50.3%) who received dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD 
experienced a Grade ≥3 TEAE. The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs (≥3%) in 
participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD were anaemia, dyspnoea, 
abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. 
Treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were experienced by 70 participants (13.6%) treated with 
dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD. The most frequently reported treatment-related Grade 
≥3 TEAEs (>1.0% of participants) were anaemia (1.7%), fatigue (1.6%), and lipase increased 
(1.4%). 
The only Grade 4 TEAE reported in ≥1% of participants who received dostarlimab as a single agent 
was sepsis, which was reported in 5 participants (1.0%). Grade 4 TEAEs of hyponatraemia were 
reported in 4 participants (0.8%), and Grade 4 TEAEs of dyspnoea and lipase increased were 
reported in 2 participants (0.4%) each. All other Grade 4 TEAEs were reported in 1 participant 
(0.2%) each. 
Among participants who received dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD, 14 participants had 
Grade 5 TEAEs: Respiratory failure was reported in 2 participants (0.4%) and aspiration, 
cerebrovascular accident, haemoptysis, hypoxia, infection, intestinal obstruction, large intestinal 
obstruction, pleural effusion, pneumonia, renal failure, sepsis, and shock were reported in 
1 participant (0.2%) each. None of these Grade 5 TEAEs were considered to be related to 
dostarlimab by the Investigator.

Note: AE severity was graded using CTCAE v4.03. For each SOC and PT, participants were included only once 
even if they experienced multiple events in that SOC or PT. 
Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to be included in the prescribing information were determined from 
the frequencies of TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, serious TEAEs in the RTD monotherapy pool of the 
GARNET study (N=515). Because GARNET is a single-arm study with no comparator or placebo 
arm, the medical history of the study population was considered to provide historical context for AE 
frequencies reported during the study.  
The incidence of investigator assessment of event relationship to drug and the historical frequency 
from medical history were selected as the primary methods to determine ADRs. In addition, 
adverse reactions reported for other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were reviewed and considered to be 
supportive of drug relationship based on mechanism of action and biological plausibility, 
particularly for AEs occurring at low frequency. 
For events fulfilling the causality requirement of ADR, the frequency categories in the tabulated list 
of adverse reactions (see SmPC section 4.8) was based on the frequencies of all-causality AEs (i.e. 
irrespective of investigators’ assessments of relatedness) calculated based on the RTD 
monotherapy pool from study GARNET. 
Overall, the safety of dostarlimab has been evaluated in 515 patients with endometrial cancer or 
other advanced solid tumours who received dostarlimab monotherapy in the GARNET study, 
including 129 patients with advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer. 
Dostarlimab was most commonly associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, 
including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or 
withdrawal of dostarlimab. 
Dostarlimab was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17 (3.3 %) patients; most 
of them were immune related events. Adverse reactions were serious in 8.7 % of patients; most 
serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions (see SmPC section 4.4).

a  One participant with MMRp EC discontinued study treatment due to confirmed disease progression and died 
during the long-term follow-up period, and 1 participant with MMRp EC discontinued study treatment based 
on clinical criteria by the Investigator and died during the long-term follow-up period (Listing 16.1.2a). One 
participant with NSCLC discontinued study treatment due to confirmed disease progression and died during 
the long-term follow-up period (Table 14.3.1.14, data on file). 
b  One participant with MMRp EC discontinued study treatment based on clinical criteria by the Investigator and 
died during the 90-day safety follow-up period. One participant with MMRp EC discontinued study treatment 
due to confirmed disease progression and died during the long-term follow-up period (Listing 16.1.2a). 
Fourteen (14) participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD had a TEAE 
leading to death. TEAEs of respiratory failure led to death in 2 participants. All other TEAEs leading 
to death were reported in 1 participant each. TEAEs in the SOCs of Respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders (N=6) and Infections and infestations (N=3) made up two-thirds of all TEAEs 
leading to death. None of the TEAEs that led to death were assessed by the Investigator as related 
to dostarlimab or considered to be an irAE. 
SAE 
SAEs reported for ≥1% of participants treated with dostarlimab at the RTD are summarised in  
Table 54. 
Treatment-related SAEs were experienced by 40 participants (7.8%) treated with dostarlimab as a 
single agent at the RTD. The most frequently reported treatment-related SAEs (≥0.5% of 
participants) were adrenal insufficiency, pneumonitis, and pyrexia reported in 3 participants (0.6%) 
each.

Laboratory findings  
Haematology  
Patients with dMMR/MSI-H Endometrial Cancer  
Of the 129 participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC, 1 participant had Grade 3 decreased haemoglobin at 
baseline, and 2 participants had Grade 3 decreased lymphocytes. 
Shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 haematology parameters of ≥2 grades from baseline to maximum 
postbaseline value were generally infrequent. Shifts to Grade 3 haematology parameters observed 
in >1% of participants included shifts from Grade 0 (1.6%), Grade 1 (3.1%), and Grade 2 (10.1%) 
for decreased haemoglobin; shifts from Grade 0 (1.6%), Grade 1 (1.6%), and Grade 2 (4.7%) for 
decreased lymphocytes; and shifts from Grade 1 (1.6%) for decreased leukocytes. Shifts to Grade 
4 were only observed for decreased lymphocytes (1 participant [0.8%] for shifts from Grade 0, 
Grade 1, and Grade 2 each). 
Patients Treated with Dostarlimab at the RTD  
Of the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD, 1 participant had 
Grade 3 decreased haemoglobin at baseline, and 18 participants had Grade 3 decreased 
lymphocytes. 
Shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 haematology parameters of ≥2 grades from baseline to maximum 
postbaseline value were generally infrequent. Shifts to Grade 3 haematology parameters observed 
in >1% of participants included shifts from Grade 1 (2.5%) and Grade 2 (5.4%) for decreased 
haemoglobin and shifts from Grade 0 (1.9%), Grade 1 (1.2%), and Grade 2 (3.5%) for decreased 
lymphocytes. Shifts from Grade 0 to Grade 4 haematology parameters were observed in 2 
participants (0.4%) for decreased lymphocytes and 1 participant (0.2%) each for decreased 
neutrophil count and decreased platelet count. A shift from Grade 1 to Grade 4 was observed in 1 
participant (0.2%) for decreased lymphocytes. A shift from Grade 2 to Grade 4 was observed in 1 
participant (0.2%) for decreased lymphocytes. No other shifts to Grade 4 haematology values were 
observed in this population. 
Blood Chemistry  
Patients with dMMR/MSI-H Endometrial Cancer  
For the 129 participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC, Grade 3 baseline chemistry values included 
decreased potassium (1 participant), decreased magnesium (1 participant), and decreased sodium 
(2 participants). Grade 4 baseline values included decreased corrected calcium (1 participant). 
Shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 blood chemistry parameters of ≥2 grades from baseline to maximum 
postbaseline value were generally infrequent. Shifts to Grade 3 chemistry parameters observed in 
>1% of participants included shifts from Grade 1 and Grade 2 (1.6% of participants each) for 
decreased albumin, shifts from Grade 2 (1.6% of participants) for increased alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), shifts from Grade 0 (1.6% of participants) and Grade 1 (2.3% of participants) for decreased 
sodium, shifts from Grade 1 (1.6% of participants) for increased creatinine, shifts from Grade 0

(2.3% of participants) for increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and shifts from Grade 0 
(1.6% of participants) for decreased potassium. Shifts to Grade 4 chemistry parameters observed 
in >0.5% of participants included shifts from Grade 0 (1.6% of participants) for increased 
corrected calcium and shifts from Grade 3 (0.8% of participants) for decreased sodium. One 
participant (0.8%) who had maximum Grade 4 increased magnesium postbaseline was missing a 
baseline value for the parameter. 
Shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 blood chemistry parameters in participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC were 
generally similar to those in participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent. 
Patients Treated with Dostarlimab at the RTD  
For the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD, Grade 3 baseline 
chemistry values included decreased albumin (2 participants), increased alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) (3 participants), increased corrected calcium (2 participants), decreased potassium (2 
participants), decreased magnesium (3 participants), and decreased sodium (9 participants). Grade 
4 baseline values included decreased corrected calcium (1 participant). 
Shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 blood chemistry parameters of ≥2 grades from baseline to maximum 
postbaseline value were generally infrequent. Shifts to Grade 3 chemistry parameters observed in 
>1% of participants included shifts from Grade 2 (1.2% of participants) for decreased albumin, 
shifts from Grade 2 (1.6% of participants) for increased ALP, shifts from Grade 0 and Grade 1 
(2.5% of participants each) for decreased sodium, shifts from Grade 0 (1.4% of participants) for 
increased ALT, and shifts from Grade 0 (1.6% of participants) for increased total bilirubin (TBL). 
Shifts to Grade 4 chemistry parameters observed in >0.5% of participants included shifts from 
Grade 0 (0.8% of participants each) for increased corrected calcium and decreased corrected 
calcium and shifts from Grade 3 (0.6% of participants) for decreased sodium. 
Shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 blood chemistry parameters in participants treated with dostarlimab 
as a single agent were generally similar to those in participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC. 
Incidence of Potential Liver Toxicity Events  
Patients with dMMR/MSI-H Endometrial Cancer  
The incidence of potential liver toxicity events reported for participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC was 
similar to the one reported in patients treated with Dostarlimab at the RTD (see below). 
Patients Treated with Dostarlimab at the RTD  
The incidence of potential liver toxicity events in participants treated with dostarlimab at the RTD is

Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
TEAEs by Sex, SOC, and PT  
The incidence of TEAEs was generally similar between male and female patients treated with 
dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD; however, SAEs were more frequent in female 
participants (41.2%) than in male participants (33.3%). The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar 
between female and male participants: The most frequently reported PTs within the SOCs with the 
highest incidence of TEAEs were the same. 
TEAEs by Age, SOC, and PT  
Of the 515 patients treated with dostarlimab monotherapy, 51 % were under 65 years, 38 % were 
65-<75 years,  and  12 %  were  75 years  or  older.  No  overall  differences  in  safety  were  reported 
between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients (< 65 years).

TEAEs by Ethnicity, SOC, and PT  
Most of the participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD were not Hispanic or 
Latino (398 participants [77.3%]). For 17.9%, ethnicity was not reported. Due to the small number 
of participants in ethnicity subgroups other than not Hispanic or Latino and not reported (≤30 
participants), a meaningful comparison based on ethnicity could not be made. 
TEAEs by Race, SOC, and PT  
Most of the participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD were White (379 
participants [73.6%]). For 17.5%, race was not reported. Due to the small number of participants 
in race subgroups other than White or not reported (≤30 participants), a meaningful comparison 
based on race could not be made. 
TEAEs by BMI, SOC, and PT  
Of the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD, 5.4% had 
underweight BMI status (<18.5 kg/m2), 35.0% had normal BMI status (≥18.5 to <25 kg/m2), 
27.0% had overweight BMI status (≥25 to 30 kg/m2), and 30.3% had obese BMI status (≥30 
kg/m2). 
The incidence of TEAEs in the different TEAE categories by BMI status were generally similar in 
participants with a normal BMI status, overweight BMI status, and obese BMI status. The incidence 
of irAEs in participants with a normal BMI status (31.1%) was lower than that in participants with 
an overweight BMI status (38.8%). The incidence of irAEs in participants with an obese BMI status 
(35.9%) was between that of participants with normal BMI status and participants with an 
overweight BMI status. 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs in participants with a normal BMI status (56.1%) was higher than 
that in participants with an obese BMI status (42.3%) or overweight BMI status (49.6%). SAEs 
were reported more frequently in participants with a normal BMI status (40.6%) or overweight BMI 
status (40.3%) than in participants with an obese BMI status (34.6%). TEAEs leading to treatment 
interruption were reported less frequently in participants with normal BMI status (20.6%) than in 
participants with an overweight BMI status (25.9%), but more frequently than in participants with 
an obese BMI status (16.7%).

The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar between the different BMI status subgroups: The most 
frequently reported PTs within the SOCs with the highest incidence of TEAEs were the same. 
Due to the small number of participants with an underweight BMI status (≤30 participants), a 
meaningful comparison could not be made with the other BMI status categories. 
TEAEs by Baseline ECOG Performance Status, SOC, and PT  
Of the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab single agent at the RTD, 57.3% had a baseline 
ECOG performance status of 1, and 42.5% of participants had a baseline ECOG performance status 
of 0. The baseline ECOG performance status was missing in 1 participant (0.2%). The incidence of 
TEAEs were generally higher in participants with an ECOG performance status of ≥1 compared with 
those with an ECOG performance status of 0 for participants treated with dostarlimab as a single 
agent at the RTD (e.g. Grade ≥3 TEAEs: 54.2% vs 44.7%; SAEs: 45.1% vs 31.5%; TEAEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation: 11.2% vs 7.3%). 
The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar between the 2 baseline ECOG performance status 
subgroups: The most frequently reported PTs within the SOCs with the highest incidence of TEAEs 
were the same. 
TEAEs by Baseline Kidney Function  
Kidney function was defined as normal for creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥90 mL/min, mildly impaired 
for CrCl <90 to ≥60 mL/min, moderately impaired for CrCl <60 to ≥30 mL/min, and severely 
impaired for CrCl <30 mL/min. 
In participants treated with dostarlimab as a single agent at the RTD, the incidence of TEAEs in the 
different TEAE categories was generally similar between participants with normal (N=230), mildly 
impaired (N=199), or moderately impaired (N=83) baseline kidney function. 
The incidence of irAEs in participants with normal baseline kidney function (30.0%) and 
participants with mildly impaired baseline kidney function (35.7%) was lower than that in 
participants with moderately impaired baseline kidney function (45.8%). This difference is primarily 
driven by differences in the incidence of a single PT: blood creatinine increased. The incidence was 
progressively higher in participants with impaired kidney function (mild 3.5% and moderate 
12.0%) compared to participants with normal kidney function (0.9%). 
TEAEs leading to study treatment interruption were reported more frequently in participants with 
moderately impaired baseline kidney function (30.1%) than in participants with mildly impaired 
baseline kidney function (18.1%). 
The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar between the different baseline kidney function subgroups: 
The most frequently reported TEAEs within the SOCs with the highest incidence of TEAEs were the 
same. 
There were too few participants with severely impaired kidney function at baseline (≤30 
participants) to make meaningful comparisons with other baseline kidney function subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 153/176 
 
  
  
 
TEAEs by Baseline Hepatic Function  
Hepatic function was defined based on the maximum common toxicity criteria grade for ALT or AST 
at baseline (normal=Grade 0 to 1, mildly impaired=Grade 2, moderately impaired=Grade 3, 
severely impaired=Grade 4). The majority of participants treated with dostarlimab as a single 
agent at the RTD had normal baseline hepatic function (N=512). There were 3 participants with a 
mildly impaired baseline hepatic function and no participants with moderately or severely impaired 
baseline hepatic function. Due to the small number of participants with an impaired baseline 
hepatic function, a meaningful comparison based on baseline hepatic function could not be made.  
Extrinsic Factors  
TEAEs by Geographic Region, SOC, and PT  
Of the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab single agent at the RTD, 58.1% were treated in 
Western Europe, 38.4% were treated in North America, and 3.5% were treated in Eastern Europe. 
The incidence of TEAEs was generally similar in participants in North America and participants in 
Western Europe. irAEs occurred more frequently in participants in North America (40.9%) than in 
participants in Western Europe (29.1%), which is driven at least in part by differences in the 
incidence of diarrhoea (Western Europe 4.3%; North America 10.6%). 
The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar between the 2 geographic region subgroups: The most 
frequently reported TEAEs within the SOCs with the highest incidence of TEAEs were the same. 
Due to the small number of participants (≤30 participants) from Eastern Europe, a meaningful 
comparison based on geographic region could not be made with the other region categories. 
TEAEs by Number of Prior Anticancer Treatments  
Of the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab single agent at the RTD, 45.4% had received 1 
prior anticancer treatment regimen, 37.7% had received 2 prior anticancer treatment regimens, 
12.8% had received 3 prior anticancer treatment regimens, and 4.1% had received ≥4 prior 
anticancer treatment regimens. 
The incidence of TEAEs was generally similar in participants who had received 1, 2, or 3 prior 
anticancer treatment regimens. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred less frequently in participants who had 
received 1 prior anticancer treatment regimen (46.6%) than in participants who had received 2 
(53.1%) or 3 (53.0%) prior anticancer treatment regimens. SAEs occurred more frequently in 
participants who had received 3 prior anticancer treatment regimens (48.5%) than in participants 
who had received 1 (38.9%) or 2 (37.6%) prior anticancer treatment regimens. 
The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar between the 3 prior anticancer treatment subgroups: The 
most frequently reported TEAEs within the SOCs with the highest incidence of TEAEs were the 
same. 
Due to the small number of participants (≤30 participants) who had received ≥4 prior anticancer 
treatment regimens, a meaningful comparison based on this subgroup could not be made.

TEAEs by Prior Radiotherapy, SOC, and PT  
Of the 515 participants treated with dostarlimab single agent at the RTD, 265 had received 
radiotherapy, and 250 had not received radiotherapy. 
The incidence of TEAEs was generally similar in participants who had or had not received 
radiotherapy. Grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs occurred less frequently in participants who had not 
received radiotherapy (46.8% and 35.6%, respectively) than in participants who had received 
radiotherapy (53.6% and 43.0%, respectively). 
The pattern of TEAEs by PT was similar between participants who had or had not received 
radiotherapy: The most frequently reported TEAEs within the SOCs with the highest incidence of 
TEAEs were the same.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety  
The primary evidence of safety supporting the use of dostarlimab in the intended indication derives 
from study GARNET, Cohort A1 (part 2B) which includes 129 patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC group 
and 515 patients in the RTD monotherapy group, with a data cut-off date of 01 March 2020. The 
median treatment duration is 26.0 weeks for participants with dMMR/MSI-H EC (Cohort A1) and 
20.0 weeks for patients in the monotherapy RTD pool. 
Additional supportive safety data were provided from the RTD pool plus dostarlimab combination 
therapy data (data not shown) comprising 719 patients who were treated with the 500 mg every 3 
weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks (Q6W), or 500 mg Q3W for all 
doses from the following studies: study GARNET, study 4020-01-001 (AMBER) with dostarlimab in 
combination with TSR-022±TSR-033 in patients with advanced solid tumours and study 3000 01 
002 (IO-Lite) with dostarlimab in combination  with niraparib, platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy or bevacizumab in patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumours.  
dMMR/MSI-H EC group (n=129) 
Patients exposure 
At the time of the most recent data cut-off (01 March 2020), 63.6% patients remained in the study 
and 45% were still on treatment. The primary reason for study discontinuation was death (n=36, 
27.9%), followed by withdrawal of consent (n=8, 6.2%). No patients were reported to have 
discontinued the study due to adverse events. Regarding study treatment, the main reason to 
discontinue study treatment was disease progression (n=49, 38.0%), followed by AE (n=14, 
10.9%).  
The median duration of treatment for this patient group was 26 weeks (range: 3.0, 139.0), with a 
median relative dose intensity of 100% during the first 12 weeks, as well as from week 13 onward. 
Infusion delays occurred in 24.8% with a ≥7-day delay for most of them (24%). This suggests that 
most patients received the planned dose, with a low number of delays, which is reassuring.  
Overall, 31 patients (24%) had at least 1 dose interruption due to AEs, 15 (11.6%) had an AE that 
lead to permanent treatment discontinuation, suggesting that dostarlimab is well tolerated.  
Adverse events 
With the most recent cut-off date (1 March 2020) and 129 patients included in the safety data set 
of the dMMR/MSI-H EC group, 95.3% of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC population reported any AE, 
and 48.1% reported Grade≥3 AEs. Most commonly reported AEs (>20% of patients) were nausea 
(32.6%), diarrhoea (27.9%), fatigue (24.8%), anaemia (27.1%) and asthenia (21.7%). The most 
commonly reported Grade ≥3 AEs were anaemia (14.7%), abdominal pain (5.4%) and 
hyponatraemia (3.9%). The uncontrolled nature of the study hampers contextualisation of the 
safety data with a comparator and thus limit the assessment of treatment-related AEs.  
Serious adverse events were reported by 34.1% of patients, the most commonly reported were 
abdominal pain, acute kidney injury and sepsis (reported by 3.1% of patients, each), followed by 
pyrexia, urinary tract infection, and pulmonary embolism (2.3%, each). 
A total of 36 (27.9%) patients had died at the time of the most recent data cut-off, most of them 
due to disease progression (n=31, 24.0%). Five (3.9%) patients experienced AEs leading to death, 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021

none of them considered related to dostarlimab. The types of AEs leading to death were 
pneumonia, shock, sepsis, aspiration bronchial and pleural effusion (each AE was reported in a 
single patient).  
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were reported for 15 (11.6%) of patients. The 
most commonly (≥1%) reported AEs leading to study drug discontinuation by PT were 
transaminases increased and ALT increased (n=2, 1.6%, each). The proportion of patients with any 
AEs leading to dose interruptions were 24.0%; infusion delays occurred in 24.8% (most of them 
≥7 days). The most common AEs leading to dose interruptions were anaemia (3.1%), and 
diarrhoea (2.3%). 
With regards to adverse events of special interest, immune-related adverse reactions, which may 
be severe or fatal, can occur in patients treated with antibodies blocking the programmed cell 
death protein-1 / programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway, including dostarlimab. 
Therefore, immune-related AEs (irAE) were considered as AE of special interest according to 
dostarlimab mechanism of action and pharmacological class. Overall, 36% of patients experienced 
an irAE (8.5% diarrhoea, 7.0% hypothyroidism). Overall, 4.7% of irAEs led to treatment 
discontinuation, the most common ones were to transaminases increased and ALT increased 
(1.6%, n=2, each). 
IrARs including immune-related pneumonitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, immune-related skin 
adverse reactions, nephritis were reported with dostarlimab and are considered important identified 
risks (see RMP). While immune-related adverse reactions usually occur during treatment with 
PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, symptoms can also manifest after discontinuation of treatment. 
Immune-related adverse reactions may occur in any organ or tissue and may affect more than one 
body system simultaneously. Therefore, important immune-related adverse reactions listed in the 
SmPC section 4.4 are not inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune-related reactions. 
Early identification and management of immune-related adverse reactions are essential to ensure 
safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Patients should be monitored for symptoms and signs 
of immune-related adverse reactions. Clinical chemistries, including liver tests and thyroid function 
tests,  should  be  evaluated  at  baseline  and  periodically  during  treatment.  For  suspected 
immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation including specialty consultation should be 
ensured (see SmPC section 4.4).  
The patient’s information and early recognition of the signs and symptoms of the most commonly 
observed immune-related adverse reactions are considered paramount for the safe use of the PD-1 
medicinal products. Therefore, a patient card will be put in place to address the important identified 
risk of immune-related adverse reactions, as additional risk minimisation measure (see RMP). This 
patient alert card will also include a section for other HCPs with information on the risk of immune-
related  adverse  reactions  and  the  prescriber’s  contact  information.  All  prescribers  of  dostarlimab 
should inform patients about the Patient Alert Card, explaining what to do should they experience 
any symptom of immune related adverse reactions. The physician will provide the Patient Alert Card 
to each patient (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Based  on  the severity  of  the  adverse  reaction,  treatment  with dostarlimab should  be  withheld  or 
permanently discontinued and corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other 
appropriate  therapy  administered  (see  below  and  section 4.2).  Upon  improvement  to  Grade ≤1, 
corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued for 1 month or longer. Based on limited data 
from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with 
corticosteroid  use,  administration  of  other  systemic  immunosuppressants  can  be  considered. 
Hormone replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should be instituted as warranted (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 160/176 
 
  
  
 
Treatment with dostarlimab should be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related 
adverse reaction that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reaction toxicity, except 
for endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones and unless otherwise specified 
in Table 2 of the SmPC. 
Specific  warnings  and  precautions  have  also  been  included  in  the  SmPC  to  ensure  adequate 
management of immune-related adverse reactions which were reported with dostarlimab including 
pneumonitis,  colitis,  hepatitis,  endocrinopathies  (including  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  and 
adrenal insufficiency), nephritis and rash. 
Since  pneumonitis  has  been  reported  in  patients  receiving  dostarlimab  (see  SmPC  section 4.8), 
patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should 
be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other causes excluded. Patients should be managed with 
dostarlimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Dostarlimab  can  cause  immune-related  colitis  (see  SmPC  section 4.8).  Thus,  patients  should  be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis and managed with dostarlimab treatment modifications, 
anti-diarrhoeal agents and corticosteroids (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Dostarlimab  can  also cause  immune-related  hepatitis  (see  SmPC  section 4.8).  Patients  should be 
monitored  for  changes  in  liver  function periodically as  indicated, based  on  clinical  evaluation and 
managed with dostarlimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Furthermore, 
immune-related  endocrinopathies, 
including  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism, 
thyroiditis, hypophysitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus and adrenal insufficiency, have been reported in 
patients  receiving  dostarlimab  (see  SmPC  section 4.8).  Immune-related  hypothyroidism  and 
hyperthyroidism  (including 
thyroiditis)  occurred 
in  patients 
receiving  dostarlimab,  and 
hypothyroidism  may  follow  hyperthyroidism.  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  abnormal  thyroid 
function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. 
Immune-related hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) should be managed as 
recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
There  were  also  cases  of  immune-related  adrenal  insufficiency  occurring  in  patients  receiving 
dostarlimab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. 
For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2 
of the SmPC. 
Dostarlimab  can  cause  immune-related  nephritis  (see  SmPC  section 4.8).  Patients  should  be 
monitored for changes in renal function and manage with dostarlimab treatment modifications and 
corticosteroids (see section 4.2) of the SmPC. 
Immune-related rash has been reported in patients receiving dostarlimab, including pemphigoid (see 
SmPC section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash. Immune-related 
rash should be managed as recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Events of Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. 
Caution should be used when considering the use of dostarlimab in a patient who has previously 
experienced  a  severe  or  life-threatening  skin  adverse  reaction  on  prior  treatment  with  other 
immune-stimulatory anticancer agents (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Immune related arthralgia has been reported in patients receiving dostarlimab (see SmPC section 
4.8), with approximately one half of these cases considered related to dostarlimab by investigators. 
Patients  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  arthralgia.  Suspected  immune  related 
arthralgia  should  be  confirmed  and  other  causes  excluded.  Patients  should  be  managed  with 
dostarlimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see section 4.2).

Given the mechanism of action of dostarlimab other potential immune related adverse reactions may 
occur, including potentially serious events [e.g. myositis, myocarditis, encephalitis, demyelinating 
neuropathy (including Guillain Barré syndrome), sarcoidosis]. Clinically significant immune related 
adverse reactions reported in less than 1 % of patients treated with dostarlimab as monotherapy in 
clinical  studies  include  autoimmune  haemolytic  anaemia,  pancreatitis,  iridocyclitis,  uveitis  and 
diabetic  ketoacidosis.  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  immune  related 
adverse  reactions  and  managed  as  described  in  section  4.2.  Solid  organ  transplant  rejection  has 
been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with 
dostarlimab may  increase  the  risk  of  rejection  in solid  organ transplant  recipients.  The  benefit  of 
treatment with dostarlimab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should be considered in these 
patients.  
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD 1/PD-L1–blocking antibody. 
Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), acute GvHD, 
chronic  GvHD,  hepatic  veno-occlusive  disease  after  reduced  intensity  conditioning,  and  steroid-
requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur 
despite  intervening  therapy  between  PD-1/PD-L1  blockade  and  allogeneic  HSCT.  Follow  patients 
closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. The benefit versus 
risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibody should be considered prior to or after an 
allogeneic HSCT. 
Although no infusion-related reactions were reported in dMMR/MSI-H EC patients, infusion -related 
reactions including hypersensitivity occurred in 7 (1.4 %) patients, including grade 2 (1.2 %) and 
grade  3  (0.2  %)  infusion-related  reactions  in  the  monotherapy  dataset  and  is  considered  an 
important identified risk (see RMP). All patients recovered from the infusion-related reaction. Since 
dostarlimab  can  cause  infusion-related  reactions,  which  can  be  severe  (see  SmPC  sections  4.4 
and 4.8),  a  warning  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  For  severe  (grade 3)  or  life-threatening 
(grade 4)  infusion-related  reactions,  the  infusion  should  be  stopped  and  treatment  should  be 
permanently discontinued (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4).  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
is a contraindication (see SmPC section 4.3). 
Fluctuation in laboratory parameters, including blood chemistry parameters (e.g., increased 
transaminases, increased alkaline phosphatase), blood counts (anaemia, lymphopenia, mainly) 
have been observed during dostarlimab therapy.  
Patients with the following status were excluded from the GARNET study and therefore no safety 
data is available in these patients (see SmPC section 4.4): ECOG baseline performance score ≥ 2; 
uncontrolled central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis; other malignancies 
within the last 2 years; immunodeficiency or receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days; 
active  HIV,  hepatitis  B  or  hepatitis  C  infection;  active  autoimmune  disease  requiring  systemic 
treatment in the past 2 years excluding replacement therapy; history of interstitial lung disease; or 
receiving live vaccine within 14 days.  
No  participants  who  received  dostarlimab  at  the  RTD  experienced  overdose  of  dostarlimab.  If 
overdose  is  suspected,  the  patient  should  be  monitored  for  any  signs  or  symptoms  of  adverse 
reactions or effects, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Based on the available safety data, dostarlimab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive 
and use machines (see SmPC section 4.7).

Regarding the safety in special populations, AEs leading to death and AEs of special interest for the 
elderly population appear to be slightly more frequent for patients over the age of 65 when compared 
to  younger  patients  with  dMMR/MSI-H  EC.  The  same  trend  is  observed  for  patients  in  the 
monotherapy pool. However, no new safety concerns arose from these data and it is considered that 
these risks can be adequately managed with the warning and precautions included in the SmPC. 
The safety of dostarlimab in children and adolescents aged under 18 years has not been established. 
No data are available. 
There are no or limited amount of data on the use of dostarlimab in pregnant women. Based on its 
mechanism  of  action,  dostarlimab  can  cause  foetal  harmful  pharmacological  effects  when 
administered  during  pregnancy  (see  SmPC  section  4.6).  Animal  reproduction  and  development 
studies have not been conducted with dostarlimab; however, inhibition of the PD 1/PD L1 pathway 
can lead to increased risk of immune mediated rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal 
death (see section on non-clinical aspects and SmPC section 5.3). Human immunoglobulins (IgG4) 
are known to cross the placental barrier, and therefore, being an IgG4, dostarlimab has the potential 
to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Therefore, there is a risk associated 
with  the  administration  of  dostarlimab  to  women  of childbearing potential  and  dostarlimab  is  not 
recommended  during  pregnancy  and 
in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception.Women  of  childbearing  potential  must  use effective  contraception  during  treatment 
with dostarlimab and until 4 months after the last dose of Dostarlimab (see SmPC section 4.6). 
With regards to breastfeeding, it is unknown whether dostarlimab/metabolites are excreted in human 
milk.  A  risk  to  the  newborns/infants cannot  be  excluded.  Dostarlimab  should  not be  used  during 
breast  feeding  and breast  feeding should be avoided  for  at  least  4 months after the  last  dose  of 
dostarlimab. 
Furthermore, fertility studies have not been conducted with dostarlimab (see SmPC section 4.6). 
With  regards  to  immunogenicity,  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  were  tested  in  315  patients  who 
received dostarlimab and the incidence of dostarlimab treatment emergent ADAs was 2.5 % (see 
clinical pharmacology section). Neutralising antibodies were detected in 1.3 % of patients. In the 
patients  who developed  anti  dostarlimab  antibodies,  there  was  no evidence  of  altered efficacy or 
safety of dostarlimab (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Overall,  the  main  evidence  to  characterise  dostarlimab  safety  profile  comes  from  ongoing, 
uncontrolled  studies  hampering  a  contextualisation  of  the  safety  data.  Despite  this  limitation, 
available information shows that dostarlimab safety profile is consistent with the profile known for 
its pharmacological class and no new signals have been identified. Furthermore, long-term safety 
data are missing (see RMP). Although no new safety signals have been identified to date from patients 
remaining on treatment for >1 year in study GARNET, data from this sub-population is limited to 
date and long-term safety (>1 year of dostarlimab treatment, >2 years of dostarlimab treatment) 
will continue to be evaluated by routine pharmacovigilance.  
The general safety profile from the GARNET 2B group (monotherapy use) is consistent with that of 
the dMMR/MSI-H EC patients. The RTD monotherapy group, as the largest currently available safety 
dataset, was selected as the basis to estimate more accurately the frequencies of ADR described in 
the SmPC.   
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. Since dostarlimab is a biological product, the tradename 
and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in order to improve 
the traceability (see SmPC section 4.4).

Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Dostarlimab is a new agent from an already known pharmacological class (PD-1 inhibitors). The 
available safety data do not show any new or concerning findings for this type of agents. At 
present, the limited size of the safety database and long-term data do not allow a comprehensive 
characterisation of its safety profile. However, the available safety data are considered adequate in 
the context of a conditional marketing authorisation. Additional safety data will be provided from 
study GARNET and study RUBY that will allow to further characterise the observed safety profile of 
dostarlimab. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
Overall, the available evidence suggests that dostarlimab safety is consistent with the profile 
known for its pharmacological class and no new signals have been identified. The safety profile of 
dostarlimab in the intended indication is considered overall acceptable. Adequate risk minimisation 
measures are in place to manage the risks associated with dostarlimab, including the important 
risk of immune related adverse reactions (see RMP and SmPC). Uncertainties remain due to the 
limited size of the safety database, the lack of direct controls and the missing long-term data.  
Long term safety will continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. Furthermore, 
the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with mismatch 
repair  deficient  (dMMR)/microsatellite  instability-high  (MSI-H)  recurrent  or  advanced 
endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-
containing regimen the MAH should submit updated results of the GARNET study, Cohort A1, 
including at least 131 patients with measurable disease followed for at least 12 months from 
the onset of response. The CSR should be submitted by 31 December 2022.  
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with mismatch 
repair  deficient  (dMMR)/microsatellite  instability-high  (MSI-H)  recurrent  or  advanced 
endometrial cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-
containing regimen the MAH should submit the results of the phase III, randomised, double-
blind  study  RUBY,  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  dostarlimab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone  in patients  with  recurrent or  advanced endometrial 
cancer who have not received prior systemic anticancer therapy for recurrent or advanced 
disease. The CSR should be submitted by 31 December 2022).

set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of 
the PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance  
The applicant declared that dostarlimab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers dostarlimab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information  
2.10.1.  User consultation  
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring  
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Jemperli (dostarlimab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional 
marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a]. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement 
that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick 
identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Dostarlimab is intended as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair 
deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer 
(EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel is considered the standard of care (SOC) for first-line 
treatment of advanced or metastatic EC based on its similar efficacy and improved toxicity 
compared to cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel (ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline for Endometrial 
cancer, Ann Oncol 2013; 24 (Suppl 6)). For patients with recurrent or advanced EC who have 
progressed on or after treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, there are no approved 
therapies or specific regimens recommended by consensus guidelines in the EU. Depending on the 
extent and location of recurrent disease, histology, and patients’ overall health including 
comorbidities, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy can be considered as 
treatment options.  
Currently available systemic therapy options for recurrent or advanced EC in the second-line 
setting (with prior exposure to platinum-containing therapy) include liposomal doxorubicin, 
oxaliplatin, docetaxel, topotecan, and bevacizumab (ESMO guidance: Colombo, N et al. ESMO-
ESGO-ESTRO Consensus Conference on Endometrial Cancer: Diagnosis, Treatment and Follow-up. 
Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2016;26(1), 2-30). Data for these agents, which are derived from small 
single-arm, non-registrational studies, are limited and show that overall clinical benefit is very 
limited and invariably short-lived, with ORRs of approximately 7% to 14% and median OS of 6 to 
11 months. Even for the agents with a higher ORR (13.5%), the reported median OS was similar to 
that of agents with relatively lower ORR and remained at <1 year. Additionally, long-term 
treatment is challenging even for the patients who achieve responses or disease stabilization due 
to cumulative chemotherapy-related toxicities.  
Available evidence from a literature review suggests that similar rates of response would be 
expected in the subset of dMMR/MSI-H EC with available therapies.  
Because there is no approved therapy or recognized SOC for patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC who 
have progressed on or after treatment with a platinum-containing regimen and available treatment 
options provide limited clinical activity in terms of ORR and OS, there is a crucial need to develop 
new therapeutic options that have meaningful and durable clinical activity in this patient 
population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The main evidence of efficacy submitted comes from Study 4010-01-001 (GARNET), a multicentre, 
open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation study with expansion cohorts in patients with recurrent or 
advanced solid tumours.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176464/2021 
Page 168/176 
 
  
  
 
Efficacy data supporting the claimed indication initially included data from 129 patients with 
dMMR/MSI-H EC in Cohort A1 at the DCO 1 March 2020, of whom 108 constitutes the primary 
efficacy population (i.e. participants with measurable disease at baseline and the opportunity for at 
least 24 weeks of follow-up, including those who discontinued prematurely due to AEs or disease 
progression). Some supportive efficacy data from 50 patients with dMMR/MSI-H non-endometrial 
cancer (non-EC) advanced solid tumours in Cohort F of Study 4010-01-001 was also provided.  
The primary efficacy endpoints for Cohort A1 were Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of 
Response DOR according to RECIST v1.1 assessed by BICR.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included Disease Control rate, Progression Free Survival and Overall 
Survival as well as immune-related ORR, DOR, DCR and PFS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
In patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC from Study 4010-01-001 Cohort A1, the ORR as assessed based 
on RECIST 1.1 by BICR was 43.5% (95% CI: 34.0, 53.4) with 10.2% CRs (11 of 108 patients) at 
the time of the data cutoff date (01 March 2020). The median DOR had not been reached, and 
78.7% of responders had a DOR ≥6 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the probability of 
maintaining a response for 6, 12, and 18 months in patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC was 97.9%, 
90.9%, and 80.1%, respectively. At the time of the data cutoff date, 89.4% of responders had an 
ongoing response. 
In terms of progression free survival, 47.2% had no PFS event, and longer follow-up is needed for 
a stable and accurate estimation of PFS. The majority of patients in the primary efficacy analysis 
set did not have an OS event (67.6%), and the median OS was not reached. 
Secondary endpoints according to irRECIST based on Investigator assessment, showed consistent 
results.  
Subgroup analyses defined by tumour MSI status, number of prior anticancer therapy regimens, 
prior radiation therapy, prior bevacizumab use, BOR from last platinum-containing prior anticancer 
therapy, and progression-free interval from last platinum containing prior anticancer therapy were 
conducted. Overall, results of subgroup analyses for ORR and DOR were consistent with the 
primary efficacy results in the overall population of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC.  
Subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression (exploratory analysis) showed differences in the rates of 
tumour responses (PD-L1<1% ORR 30.4% vs PD-L1≥1% 55.2%).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
The main source of evidence comes from a non-comparative single arm, open label, phase 1 dose 
escalation and expansion cohort study, which is currently ongoing. The lack of comparator and the 
immaturity of data for some relevant outcomes, make interpretation of the actual clinical relevance 
of the results challenging. These uncertainties are expected to be addressed upon completion of 
the GARNET Study, where mature results for tumour responses, duration of responses and overall 
survival results will be available for an extended number of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC. 
Furthermore, results from study RUBY, a randomised double-blind Phase III study of dostarlimab in 
combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin plus paclitaxel considered the SOC) versus 
chemotherapy alone, in chemotherapy-naïve subjects with recurrent or advanced endometrial 
Assessment report

cancer will be submitted to provide further evidence of safety and efficacy of dostarlimab in the 
treatment of MSI-H endometrial cancer (EC).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
The safety dataset comprised 129 patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC with an overall median treatment 
duration of 26.0 weeks. Twelve patients (9.3 %) received treatment for a duration ≥ 96 weeks (22 
months). 95.3% of patients reported any AE, and 48.1% reported ≥Grade 3 AEs. Treatment-related 
TEAEs were reported in 63.6% of participants and treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
experienced by 17 participants (13.2%). Treatment-related SAEs were experienced by 12 
participants (9.3%). 
AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were reported for 15 (11.6%) of patients. The 
most commonly (≥1%) reported AEs leading to study drug discontinuation by PT were 
transaminases increased and ALT increased (n=2, 1.6%, each). The proportion of patients with any 
AEs leading to dose interruptions were 24.0%; infusion delays occurred in 24.8% (most of them 
≥7 days).  
Immune-related AEs (irAE) are considered as AE of special interest according to dostarlimab 
mechanism of action and pharmacological class. Overall, 36.4% patients experienced an irAE 
(8.5% diarrhoea, 7.0% hypothyroidism). Overall, 4.7% of irAEs led to treatment discontinuation, 
the most common ones were transaminases increased and ALT increased (1.6%, n=2, each).  
In general, the safety profile for patients with dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer in the GARNET 
study was not different from that of the overall RTD monotherapy population (n=515). The median 
duration of treatment in this population was 20 weeks.  
The most common adverse reactions (> 10 %) were anaemia (25.6 %), nausea (25.0 %), 
diarrhoea (22.5 %), vomiting (18.4 %), arthralgia (13.8%), pruritus (11.5 %), rash (11.1 %),  
pyrexia (10.5 %) and hypothyroidism (10.1 %).  
Adverse reactions were serious in 8.7 % of patients; most serious adverse reactions were immune-
related adverse reactions. Most commonly reported Grade 3 and 4 drug related AEs were anaemia 
(8.7%), transaminases increased (2.5%), nausea (1.9%), vomiting (1.6%), diarrhoea (1.2%) and 
rash (1.2%).  
Dostarlimab was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17 (3.3 %) patients; most 
of them were immune-related events.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
The main evidence to characterise dostarlimab safety profile comes from ongoing, uncontrolled 
studies, which is a limitation to contextualise the safety findings. Safety data available in the target 
population (dMMR/MSI-H Endometrial Cancer) is small in size (n=129 with the most recent cut-off 
date) and long-term exposure is limited. However, the safety data available are considered 
adequate in the context of a CMA. 
Additional data from study GARNET and study RUBY will be submitted post-authorisation which will 
further characterise the observed safety profile of dostarlimab in the claimed indication.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The observed tumour responses rate of 43.5% (95%CI 34.0, 53.5) is considered promising in 
patients with dMMR/MSI-H recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (EC) that have progressed on 
or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, including 10.2% CR, 33.3% PR, 
with responses ongoing in 89.4% of responders at the time of the data cut-off date. Median DOR 
has not been reached yet.  
Currently available systemic therapy options (mainly single agent chemotherapy) for recurrent or 
advanced EC in the second-line setting provide very limited overall clinical activity and invariably 
short-lived, with objective response rates (ORRs) of approximately 7% to 14% and median overall 
survival (OS) of 6 to 11 months. Endometrial cancer recurring after first-line chemotherapy is 
largely a chemoresistant disease. Available data suggest that the presence of dMMR/MSI-H does 
not predict better treatment outcomes for chemotherapy. Thus, similar outcomes might be 
expected for the dMMR/MSI-H subset of advanced EC patients in 2nd line.  
In this disease setting, it is emphasised that the observed magnitude of tumour responses, which 
seem durable, is well above those previously observed with available, unapproved treatment 
options commonly used in this patient population in the EU. The observed benefit, if confirmed, is

considered clinically relevant as it is reasonable to assume that it will translate into a survival 
benefit. 
Overall, the available information suggests that dostarlimab safety is consistent with the profile 
known for its pharmacological class and no new signals have been identified. Data available, 
although limited in size and long-term exposure, appear acceptable and suggest a tolerable profile.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
Results from available literature suggest that single agent chemotherapy provides ORRs of 
approximately 7% to 14% and median overall survival (OS) of 6 to 11 months in 2nd line therapy. 
In this context, the observed magnitude of tumour responses following treatment with dostarlimab, 
which seem durable, is well above those previously observed with available treatment options in 
the EU. These preliminary results are considered promising and supportive of clinical benefit, as it 
is reasonable to expect that these will translate into a survival benefit. 
The observed safety profile appears consistent with the one expected for its pharmacological class 
and no new signals have been identified.   
Nevertheless, uncertainties on the actual clinical benefit remain due to the immaturity of data and 
lack of comparator. Furthermore, the safety database is small and limited in terms of long-term 
exposure. These uncertainties will be addressed by means of the specific obligations which will 
provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data. 
In conclusion, it is considered that preliminary efficacy and safety data support a favourable 
benefit/risk balance for dostarlimab in the treatment of patients with advanced dMMR/MSI-H EC. 
Nevertheless, additional comprehensive evidence will be provided in order to establish firm 
conclusions on the actual benefits and risks of dostarlimab (see SOBs).  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission for dostarlimab 50 mg/mL concentrate for 
solution for infusion pursuant to Commission Regulation No 507/2006.  
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously life-threatening 
disease.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional 
marketing authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
Further data from the ongoing GARNET study Cohort A1 expansion of enrolment will be 
submitted. This will provide safety and additional efficacy data, including longer follow up of 
the study population, i.e. patients with recurrent or advanced dMMR/MSI-H EC that has 
progressed following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen. Therefore, more

robust data on tumour responses, and mature results on the DOR, PFS and OS will be 
available for an extended database size. For GARNET Cohort A1 (expansion), a primary 
analysis of ORR and DOR data is foreseen for Q4 2021 including at least 131 patients with 
measurable disease followed for at least 12 months from the onset of response. The CSR will 
be submitted by 31 December 2022. 
Furthermore, data from study 4010-03-001 (RUBY), a randomised double-blind Phase III 
study of dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin plus paclitaxel considered 
the SOC) versus chemotherapy alone, in chemotherapy-naïve subjects with recurrent or 
advanced endometrial cancer will be provided. This study is expected to include approximately 
25% of patients with dMMR/MSI-H EC. Patients will be stratified by MMR/MS status. The 
results of the primary analysis of PFS, as assessed by BICR (N=470) together with the results 
of the interim OS analysis will be submitted by 31 December 2022.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, in view of the observed response rates. In the context 
of patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer progression on or following prior 
treatment with a platinum containing regimen these results are unprecedented. Endometrial 
cancer recurring after first-line chemotherapy is largely a chemoresistant disease. Results 
from available literature suggest that single agent chemotherapy provides ORRs of 
approximately 7% to 14% and median overall survival of 6 to 11 months in 2nd line therapy. 
In this context, it is emphasised that the observed magnitude of tumour responses, which 
seem durable, is well above to those previously observed with available treatment options in 
the EU.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required. In light of the unmet medical need for patients with 
recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer progression on or following prior treatment with a 
platinum containing regimen and considering the positive benefit/risk balance for dostarlimab 
in the intended indication this criterion is considered fulfilled.  
3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall B/R of Jemperli, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch 
repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial 
cancer (EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing 
regimen, is positive.  
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Jemperli is favourable in the following indication: 
Jemperli is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair 
deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability high (MSI H) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer 
(EC) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum containing regimen.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to 
the following conditions:

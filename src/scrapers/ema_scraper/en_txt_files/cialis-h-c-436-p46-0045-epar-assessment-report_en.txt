1.  Introduction 
On 20/05/2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cialis (tadalafil) and Adcirca 
(tadalafil), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. These data are 
also submitted as part of a post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal, X-linked genetic disease affecting approximately 1 in 
3600 to 6000 male births and for which there is no approved disease-specific treatment (Bushby et al. 
2010). Patients with DMD lack normal expression of the dystrophin protein in skeletal, cardiac, and 
smooth muscle. Boys are diagnosed as toddlers when parents notice they are weak. As these boys 
age, mobility gradually declines and contractures develop. 
Patients usually lose the ability to walk independently by age 13, however, glucocorticoid treatment 
helps to prolong ambulation and stave off contractures (Bushby et al. 2010; Moxley et al. 2010). Once 
boys with DMD are no longer able to walk, they have a significant loss of quality of life. Caregivers, 
patients, and healthcare professionals agree that delaying the progressive loss of walking ability is a 
strong and valuable health benefit in DMD (Peay et al. 2014). Death can occur by age 20 from 
respiratory or cardiac failure, although more patients are surviving up to age 30 as a result of 
noninvasive home ventilation, glucocorticoid treatment, and improved cardiac management (Eagle et 
al. 2002; Passamano et al. 2012). 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study H6D-MC-LVJJ (A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 
Trial of Tadalafil for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Tadalafil 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg tablets (authorized in adults) were used in children and 
adolescents in Study H6D-MC-LVJJ.  The study drug was administered as a single dose and assigned 
based on body weight. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

Study H6D-MC-LVJJ (A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled,  Phase 3 Trial of 
Tadalafil for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy)  
Description 
Study LVJJ is a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm 
study of tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg daily in patients with DMD who were being treated with 
corticosteroids. The study consisted of a 48-week double-blind treatment period, followed by an OLE. 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that once-daily tadalafil administered orally for 48 
weeks lessened the decline in ambulatory ability as measured by the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) 
compared to placebo in boys with DMD.  
The secondary objectives were to test the hypothesis that once-daily tadalafil administered orally for 
48 weeks compared with placebo in boys with DMD: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
lessened the decline in North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) global score; 
lessened the decline in performance on timed function tests (rise from floor from 
supine, 10 meter walk/run, stair climb, and stair descend); 
delayed the time to persistent 10% worsening in the 6MWD or the timed function 
tests; 
lessened the decline in quality of life (QoL), as measured by the Pediatric Outcomes 
Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) global functioning scale and the following core 
scales: Upper Extremity/Physical Functioning, Transfer/Basic Mobility, and 
Sports/Physical Functioning (Daltroy et al. 1998) 
characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tadalafil in pediatric DMD patients, and 
assess relationships between tadalafil exposure and efficacy and safety outcomes 
Exploratory objectives included assessing the decline in upper limb performance, decline in pulmonary 
function and reduced resting heart rate. 
Study design 
It is a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm study.  
Study LVJJ included both a double-blind treatment period and an OLE phase.

Abbreviations: 6MWT = 6-minute walk test; CSR = clinical study report; OLE = open-label extension; PK = pharmacokinetic sampling; Rand = 
randomization; V = visit; W = study week. 
The 48-week double-blind treatment period (boxed) is presented in this CSR (Visit 2 through Visit 7). 
Not all functional assessments for each visit are shown, only the 6MWT (see Table LVJJ.9.3). Adverse events were collected at every visit. 
Dosing instructions in OLE periods are available in the protocol located in the Protocol and Addenda appendix.  
*Patients that completed Visit 15 (Week 144) were to continue receiving tadalafil and have study visits every 3 months until 1 of 2 criteria 
were met (see study protocol for details). 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population consisted of males of 7-14 years of age with proven DMD (as defined by typical 
clinical presentation plus muscle biopsy that showed near-complete dystrophin deficiency or genetic 
confirmation), who were ambulant (6MWD between 200 and 400 meters) and showed a left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50%. Patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids for a minimum of 6 
months immediately prior to screening.  
The study was powered to detect a between-group difference in mean change score in 6MWD distance 
of 30 meters. Assuming a common standard deviation of 60 meters, 102 patients would provide 90% 
power to detect a placebo-adjusted difference of 30 meters in changes in 6MWD for each tadalafil dose 
group, resulting in a total of 306 patients planned to be enrolled into the study with a 1:1:1 ratio 
among the 3 arms. 
Treatments 
During the double-blind treatment period, patients were randomized to receive 1 of 2 target doses of 
tadalafil (0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg) or matching placebo orally once daily for 48 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 48 
weeks.

Statistical Methods 
All tests of treatment effects were conducted at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, with the exception 
of the planned testing structure of the primary objective and confirmatory secondary objectives. 
Confirmatory testing of 5 secondary objectives was to be conducted only if both null hypotheses for the 
primary objective were rejected. 
Efficacy analyses were conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. 
This set included all data from all randomized patients according to the treatment the patients were 
assigned, even if the patient never took the assigned treatment or did not receive the correct 
treatment. For the double-blind treatment period, baseline for efficacy and safety analyses was the last 
nonmissing observation prior to the first dose; the endpoint for these analyses was Visit 7 with the 
exception of a few analyses that used last observation as endpoint. 
An interim analysis was performed to assess potential futility; the data cut-off point was when 
approximately 50% of enrolled patients completed their involvement with the double-blind period 
(either completed the period or discontinued early). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 504 patients were screened, 331 patients were randomised, and 316 patients completed the 
study.

Patient disposition 
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were generally balanced with regard to most demographic characteristics. The 
mean age of patients was 9.6 years. Patients in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group were slightly older 
(mean, 9.9 years) compared to placebo (mean, 9.4 years), and this group had a higher proportion of 
patients >10 years of age (32.4%) compared to the placebo group (17.2%) and the tadalafil 0.6 
mg/kg group (19.5%). 
The majority of patients were White (79.2%). Mean 6MWD at baseline was 329 meters (54% of the 
predicted value for age and height). Mean 6MWD scores at baseline were 335.0 meters, 324.2 meters, 
and 327.8 meters in the placebo, tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, and tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg treatment groups, 
respectively. The majority of patients had baseline 6MWD ≥300 meters (74.3%). 
On the rise from floor timed function test, mean time in the placebo treatment group was 8.4 seconds, 
compared to 9.6 seconds and 10.2 seconds in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg and tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg 
treatment groups, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of patients unable to perform the rise from 
floor task independently at baseline was higher in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (30.4%) compared 
with the placebo group (22.4%) and the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (25.7%). 
All patients were taking a corticosteroid at baseline, either prednisone/prednisolone (53.8%) or 
deflazacort (45.9%). The proportion of patients reporting use of deflazacort during the study was

higher in the placebo group (51.7%) compared with the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (42.2%) and the 
tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (45.1%). Mean duration of corticosteroid therapy was 40.6 months at 
baseline, and most patients (71.9%) were taking a daily corticosteroid regimen.  
Mean compliance across all treatment groups exceeded 97% at each visit, with no appreciable 
difference between treatment groups. 
Efficacy results 
Primary Efficacy – Change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 48 
Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in ambulation as measured by the primary 6MWD 
endpoint: least squares (LS) mean change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo 
group, compared with -64.7m in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p=.307) and -59.1m in the tadalafil 
0.6 mg/kg group (p=.538). 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
There was also no evidence of efficacy of tadalafil in analysis of 6MWD expressed as a percent change 
from baseline. The LS mean percent decrease in 6MWD from baseline to Week 48 was 17.3%, 23.3%, 
and 20.8% in the placebo, tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, and tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively.  
There was no significant difference in the survival curves for persistent 10% worsening in 6MWD 
between treatments. By 48 weeks, 37.9% of patients in the placebo group experienced persistent 10% 
worsening in 6MWD, compared with 37.3% in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group and 44.2% in the tadalafil 
0.6 mg/kg group. Thirty-two (9.7%) patients lost ambulation by 48 weeks: 7 (6.0%) in the placebo 
group, compared to 16 (15.7%) in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p=.027) and 9 (8.0%) in the 
tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p=.613).  
No evidence of efficacy on the 6MWD was observed in prespecified subgroup analysis based on 
baseline ambulation category (6MWD <300 meters versus ≥300 meters), corticosteroid type

(prednisone/prednisolone versus deflazacort), or frequency of corticosteroid regimen (daily versus 
non-daily). 
There was no evidence that tadalafil treatment slowed the decline in NSAA linearized score through 48 
weeks. At 48 weeks, the LS mean change in linearised NSAA global score was -8.8  in the placebo 
group, -9.3 in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p=.748), and -9.0 in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group 
(p=.914). 
Consistent with DMD disease progression, functional performance on all of the timed function tests 
(rise from floor from supine, 10 meter walk/run, stair climb, and stair descend) declined over the 48 
weeks as evidenced by increasing time required to complete each task, decreasing velocity, and a 
general reduction in functional grade. There were no overall treatment group differences in any of the 
analyses of timed function tests that suggested efficacy of tadalafil to slow the decline in these 
measures. 
Functional QoL changes were measured using the PODCI global functioning scale and 3 core scales of 
interest from the PODCI questionnaire: upper extremity/physical functioning, transfer/basic mobility, 
and sports/physical functioning. There were no significant differences between both tadalafil group and 
placebo on the mean changes on the parent-rated PODCI global functioning scale or any of the 3 core 
scales of interest. 
Exploratory Efficacy Measures 
• 
There was no significant effect of tadalafil treatment on the PUL total score or any individual PUL 
domain score, with the exception of a statistically significant increase (improvement) in the PUL 
distal-level hand domain at 48 weeks in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group compared with placebo. The 
magnitude of this treatment difference was small (0.2 points on a 24-point scale) and not 
considered clinically meaningful.

•  Changes in absolute and percent-predicted values for pulmonary function tests (FVC, FEV1, PEF, 
and FEV1/FVC ratio) from baseline to endpoint also were small with no clinically meaningful 
treatment group differences. 
• 
There were no significant differences between either tadalafil treatment group and placebo in 
change from baseline in resting heart rate measured by ECG. In all treatment groups, decreases 
from baseline in resting heart rate were observed at Week 24 and Week 48. At Week 48, the LS 
mean decrease was -1.61 bpm in the placebo group, compared with -3.78 bpm in the tadalafil 0.3 
mg/kg group (p=.182) and -2.35 bpm in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg (p=.635) groups. 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The PopPK dataset included data from 210 patients whose ages ranged from 7 to 14 years and who 
weighed 14.5 to 76.3 kg at study entry. Age and body weight were well-balanced between the 
treatment groups. Patients in the 0.6 mg/kg treatment group tended to receive higher doses than did 
those in the 0.3 mg/kg treatment group. 
The AUC of tadalafil was not dose-proportional between the 0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg treatment 
groups. As the dose doubled from 0.3 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg, the population steady-state AUC increased 
only 43% from 6550 ng·hr/mL to 9380 ng·hr/mL. This likely reflects the fact that patients in the lower-
dose group received doses of ≤20 mg, which is the linear range in adults, whereas many patients in the 
higher-dose group received doses above 20 mg.  
Tadalafil exposures were within the range of those estimated during the recommended once-daily 
starting-dose regimens for approved treatments of ED, BPH, and PAH in adults.  
Safety results 
Safety: 48-Week Double-blind Treatment Period

Of the 331 randomized patients, 330 received a dose of study medication. Mean adjusted exposure 
duration during the double-blind treatment period was similar across treatment groups (333 days 
placebo, 336 days tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, and 330 days tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg). The patients were also 
receiving corticosteroids throughout the study and 96.4% received ≥1 concomitant medication in 
addition to corticosteroids.  
The results showed no significant between treatment group differences in the proportion of patients 
reporting ≥1 TEAE, SAE, discontinuation due to AE, DMD-related TEAE, corticosteroid-related TEAE, or 
procedure-related TEAE, and there were no deaths reported.  
There was a significantly greater proportion of patients with ≥1 TEAE assessed by the investigator as 
related to study treatment in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group compared with placebo (59.8% versus 
41.4%, p=.006), with the difference largely due to significantly more patients with treatment-related 
TEAEs of erection increased and spontaneous penile erection in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group versus 
placebo. Of note, 41.5% and 16.1% of patients across all treatment groups reported TEAEs assessed 
by the investigator as related to DMD and/or to corticosteroid use, respectively.

Spontaneous penile erection and erection increased were the only individual preferred term events 
reported by significantly higher proportions of patients in the tadalafil groups compared with placebo. 
All of the events were reported as mild or moderate in severity and none led to discontinuation. The 
TEAEs related to penile erection are consistent with the known pharmacodynamics of tadalafil and no 
events of priapism were reported. 
Most of the individual SAEs reported were consistent with the type of events expected for patients with 
DMD taking corticosteroids and the most frequently reported SAEs were falls, fractures, and infections. 
One patient in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group reported an SAE of myocarditis that led to study 
discontinuation.

Analyses of TEAEs by AUC quartiles in the tadalafil groups combined did not show a consistent pattern 
of increased TEAEs with increasing concentrations of tadalafil. There was a significant difference among 
the quartiles for the TEAE of spontaneous penile erection with a higher proportion of patients reporting 
events in the lower versus the upper AUC quartiles. Headache was the only TEAE with a significant 
difference among the AUC quartiles in which the fourth quartile had a higher proportion of patients 
reporting events compared with the 3 lower quartiles. 
There were no significant between-group differences in the proportion of patients reporting ≥1 TEAE of 
headache in either tadalafil group compared with placebo. There were no clinically meaningful 
differences in laboratory parameters from baseline to endpoint between the tadalafil and placebo 
groups when analyzed as mean change or as categorical change (ie, abnormal, low, and high). There 
were also no significant between-group differences in laboratory-related TEAEs. The criteria for 
elevated hepatic laboratory results were met by 3 patients (1 placebo, 2 tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg). One 
tadalafil patient with pre-existing Gilbert’s syndrome had elevated bilirubin at baseline and all 
postbaseline visits, and the other 2 patients met criteria for increased ALT at a single postbaseline 
visit. Hepatic enzyme increased was reported as a TEAE by the patient in the placebo group. 
Tadalafil did not have clinically meaningful effects compared with placebo on mean changes or 
categorical changes in blood pressure or pulse rate through 48 weeks. At some study time points, 
there were significant differences in the mean change in systolic and/or diastolic pressure between the 
tadalafil groups and placebo, but the effects were not persistent and likely reflect the known mild 
vasodilatory effect of PDE5 inhibition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups 
in the proportion of patients that reported TEAEs that may have been related to hypotension, including 
dizziness and falls. No events of syncope were reported during the double-blind treatment period. 
Changes in height and weight in the tadalafil groups through 48 weeks were not significantly different 
from placebo.  
There were no clinically meaningful differences between the tadalafil groups versus placebo in LVEF 
and shortening fraction measured by serial echocardiograms, LVEF and circumferential wall strain as 
measured by MRI in a subgroup of 27 patients, changes in quantitative ECG parameters, and the 
occurrence of treatment-emergent qualitative ECG abnormalities as determined by central evaluation. 
The most frequent (>10% overall) treatment emergent qualitative ECG abnormalities in all treatment 
groups were rhythm and conduction abnormalities with no significant differences between groups. 
Electrocardiogram abnormalities were also common at baseline (27.9% of patients overall had rhythm 
disturbances and 43.3% had conduction abnormalities) and thus, were not unexpected in this 
population. 
The echocardiogram measures of LV internal diameter (systole and diastole) showed small mean 
increases from baseline to 24 weeks and to 48 weeks in the tadalafil groups and placebo group, with 
significantly larger increases in the tadalafil groups compared with placebo at some time points. The 
MRI results showed mean increases from baseline to 48 weeks in LVEDV and LVESV in the tadalafil 
groups and placebo group, with the mean change in LVEDV significantly greater in the tadalafil 0.3 
mg/kg group versus placebo (p=.047). Mean changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, and LV mass 
from baseline to 48 weeks were numerically greater in the tadalafil groups compared with placebo. 
Cardiac related AEs (eg, right and left ventricular hypertrophy) were reported at a low frequency (ie, 1 
to 2 patients) with no significant difference between treatment groups.  
Few patients had clinically significant abnormal eye exams at Week 48 (3 placebo, 5 tadalafil 0.6 
mg/kg). Most TEAEs in the SOC Eye Disorders were mild in severity and 1 event of mild visual 
impairment in the placebo group led to discontinuation. Adverse events such as increased intraocular

pressure (1 patient in tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group), optic nerve cupping (1 patient in tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg 
group), and cataract (1 placebo patient) are not unexpected in patients receiving chronic corticosteroid 
therapy (Liu et al. 2013). 
In summary, the overall safety profile in Study LVJJ was generally consistent with the known safety 
profile of tadalafil and with AEs expected in a pediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. The 
only TEAEs with a significant difference between groups were erection increased and spontaneous 
penile erection and these events were expected based on the known pharmacodynamic effects of PDE5 
inhibition. There were no significant differences between groups in the proportion of patients reporting 
SAEs or who discontinued the study due to AEs. 
Although some changes in cardiac function measured by MRI and echocardiogram related to increases 
in LV volumes were greater in the tadalafil groups compared with placebo, the changes were small, 
and all other assessments of cardiac function, including LVEF by MRI and echocardiogram, were similar 
between the tadalafil and placebo groups. 
Interim 6-month OLE Treatment Period  
Patients that completed the double-blind treatment period could participate in an OLE for up to 96 
weeks. An interim clinical study report summarising the safety data collected for up to 6 months into 
the OLE has been completed (submission cutoff date of 16 December 2015). A total of 234 patients 
contributed data to the interim 6-month OLE safety analysis. All patients in the OLE received tadalafil 
once daily (0.3 mg/kg (n= 111 [including 70 who received 0.3 mg/kg in the double-blind period]) or 
0.6 mg/kg (n=123 [including 79 who received 0.6 mg/kg in the double-blind period]). 
Eight patients reported 9 SAEs, with none of the events considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug (3 [2.7%] all tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg, 5 [4.1%] all tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg). Most of the individual 
SAEs reported were consistent with the type of events expected for patients with DMD taking 
corticosteroids. The most frequently reported SAEs were related to infection (n=4) and there was 1 
SAE of fracture. One patient in the all tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group with preexisting psychiatric disorders 
reported SAEs of self-injurious behaviour and suicidal ideation. No deaths were reported and no patient 
discontinued due to ≥1 AE. 
The most common TEAEs (≥5% of patients) reported in the interim 6-month OLE were similar to those 
reported by ≥5% in either tadalafil group in the double-blind period and included fall, abasia, back 
pain, erection increased, pyrexia, and vomiting. The proportion of patients with ≥1 TEAE assessed by 
the investigators as related to study drug was 12.4% (29/234). Similar to that observed in the double-
blind phase, the investigators also assessed many of the TEAEs in the interim 6-month OLE as related 
to the DMD disease state (18.8%) and/or to corticosteroid use (4.2%).

There were no clinically meaningful effects of tadalafil on laboratory parameters from baseline to 
endpoint when analysed as mean change or as categorical change (ie, abnormal, low, and high). One 
patient met criteria for elevated hepatic laboratory results during the 6-month OLE treatment period; 
however, this patient had elevated total bilirubin since the beginning Of Study LVJJ and throughout the 
double-blind period due to a preexisting condition of Gilbert’s syndrome. 
Tadalafil did not have clinically meaningful effects on mean changes or categorical changes from 
baseline in blood pressure or pulse rate and there were no clinically important findings in ECGs based 
on mean changes from baseline in quantitative ECG parameters or on the occurrence of treatment-
emergent qualitative ECG abnormalities as determined by central evaluation. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Tadalafil (Cialis , Adcirca) is a selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enzyme. 
Tadalafil was approved for the treatment of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) dosed either as needed 
or once daily and to treat patients with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; 
dosed once daily) under the brand name Cialis. Tadalafil was also approved to treat patients with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, dosed once daily) under the brand name Adcirca. 
Tadalafil was considered to have a role in muscle function in DMD. Nonclinical and early clinical studies 
suggested that relief of microvascular ischemia could reduce use-dependent injury of skeletal muscle, 
slowing disease progression and slowing the decline in walking ability. 
The efficacy and safety of tadalafil as a treatment for ambulatory DMD patients was evaluated in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical study with 0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg 
daily dose for 48 weeks.   
The efficacy was primarily assessed by change in 6 Minute Walking Distance test from baseline through 
48 weeks. Secondary endpoints included North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and the timed 
function tests (time to run/walk 10 meters, time to climb 4 stairs, and time to descend 4 stairs). The 
health-related quality of life was assessed by the Paediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument 
(PODCI). The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tadalafil in paediatric DMD patients was also characterized.

A total of 331 boys with DMD were randomized to receive placebo (N=116), tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg 
(N=102), or tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg (N=113) for 48 weeks. The mean age of patients was 9.6 years. All 
patients in the study were on stable corticosteroid treatment. Mean 6MWD at baseline was 329 meters. 
The majority of patients had baseline 6MWD ≥300 meters (74.3%). Mean time on the rise from floor 
timed function test was 9.4 seconds.  
At 48 weeks of treatment, neither of the tadalafil treatment groups was superior to placebo as 
measured by the change in 6MWD from baseline. No treatment effect was observed in any of the 
6MWD-derived measures (percent change from baseline and time to persistent 10% worsening in 
6MWD) or in secondary endpoints (NSSA, timed function tests) in favour of tadalafil. Whereas patients 
on placebo appeared to be less severe (slightly younger, more functional patients), these imbalances 
do not justify the lack of differences observed between tadalafil and placebo.  
The overall safety profile in Study LVJJ was generally consistent with the known safety profile of 
tadalafil and with AEs expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids. Headache, 
falls, nasopharyngitis and vomiting were the most reported TEAEs. Significantly more patients with 
treatment-related TEAEs of erection increased and spontaneous penile erection were reported in the 
tadalafil groups versus placebo.  
No clinically meaningful effects compared with placebo were observed on blood pressure or pulse rate 
through 48 weeks.  
The most common TEAEs reported in the interim 6-month OLE were similar to those reported in either 
tadalafil group in the double-blind period and included fall, abasia, back pain, erection increased, 
pyrexia, and vomiting. 
The MAH has stated that the efficacy results from Study LVJJ do not support a proposed indication for 
tadalafil as a treatment for paediatric patients with DMD to slow the decline in walking ability or to 
improve function, what is acknowledged. However, the MAH proposes not to include any information 
on Study LVJJ in the current Cialis or Adcirca SmPCs. Although the efficacy or safety results of this 
study do not impact the benefit-risk assessment for currently approved indications in adults (i.e., 
treatment of erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension) it 
is considered that it may be helpful for prescribers and patients. The inclusion of (lack of) efficacy data 
from a negative study will prevent from prescribing an inefficacious treatment. The description of the 
safety profile and pharmacokinetic characterisation of tadalafil in children and adolescent is also of 
relevance. Therefore, sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 should be amended accordingly.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation

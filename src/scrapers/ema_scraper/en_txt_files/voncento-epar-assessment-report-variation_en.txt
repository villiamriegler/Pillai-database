2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is a clinically heterogeneous group of disease variants, each characterized 
by distinct quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in VWF, resulting in defective or deficient function. The 
prevalence  of  VWD  is  reported  to  be  as  high  as  1-2%  in  the  general  population  (Mannucci  MD,  2004). 
Patients with VWD are classified into Types 1, 2, and 3.  
Type 1: A quantitative defect, in which there are proportional reductions in the levels of the VWF Antigen 
(VWF:Ag) and VWF function as measured by VWF Ristocetin Cofactor activity VWF:RCo) or Collagen Binding 
capacity (VWF:CB); reduced level of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C). Type I VWD is an autosomal 
dominant disorder and is the most commonly documented form of VWD, accounting for 70-80% of cases. 
Type 2 accounts for approximately 20% of all diagnosed cases; Type 2A:  Qualitatively defective VWF in 
which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to the levels of VWF:Ag and characterised by 
absence of HMW multimers; reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. Type 2A VWD is an autosomal dominant 
disorder.  Type  2B:  Qualitatively  defective  VWF  in  which  the  levels  of  VWF:RCo  and  VWF:CB  are 
low compared to the levels of VWF:Ag; increased affinity to platelet glycoprotein Ibα results in loss of HMW 
multimers  and  thrombocytopenia;  reduced  or  normal  level  of  FVIII:C.  Type  2B  VWD  is  an  autosomal 
dominant disorder. Type 2M: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are 
low compared to the levels of VWF:Ag; no loss of HMW multimers, reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. Type 
2M  VWD  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder.  Type  2N:  Qualitatively  defective  VWF  in  which  there  is  a 
decreased  affinity  (abnormal  binding)  to  FVIII;  reduced  level  of  FVIII:C.  Type  2N  VWD  is  an  autosomal 
dominant disorder. 
Type 3: Severe deficiency of VWF characterised by VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and FVIII:C levels typically <5% (or 
virtually immeasurable). Type 3 VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder and it is the rarest form of VWD, it 
accounts for 1-3% of cases.. Type 3 VWD is very rare and occurs in approximately 1 in 300,000 – 500,000 
individuals. 
Most patients with Type 1 VWD and sometimes those with Type 2 N VWD may be treated satisfactorily with 
DDAVP, which releases endogenous VWF from endothelial cells, but for the other types of VWD use of a 
VWF/FVIII concentrate is necessary in order to achieve haemostasis during bleeds or surgery. 
Fibrinolytic inhibitors such as tranexamic acid are frequently also used during bleeds and surgery. Voncento 
is  a  human  coagulation  factor  VIII  (FVIII)/von  Willebrand  Factor  (VWF)  complex  and  belongs  to  the 
pharmacological class of haemostatic agents. This product is administered by intravenous infusion to raise 
FVIII and VWF levels in patients with corresponding deficiencies. VWF and FVIII are 2 distinct glycoproteins 
that circulate in plasma in the form of a non-covalently bound complex. Both factors are essential for normal 
haemostasis  in  humans.  Defects  in  the  VWF/FVIII  complex  underlie  2  distinct  hereditary  coagulation 
disorders:  von  Willebrand’s  disease  (VWD)  and  haemophilia  A.  Marketing  authorization  was  granted  in 
August 2013. 
In this variation submission, the MAH applies for an extension of indication for human coagulation FVIII/VWF 
complex to include prophylactic treatment of patients with VWD as follows: 
“Prophylaxis and tTreatment of haemorrhage or prevention and treatment of surgical bleeding in patients 
with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated.” 
The initial Marketing authorisation application (MAA) in Europe included the interim study report for study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54 that presented the results up to the Month 12 visit. In this submission, the interim study 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 6/68 
 
  
  
report  was  replaced  by  the  final  study  report  which  included  an  additional  12  months  of  prophylaxis 
treatment results, completing the entire 24-month treatment period of the study.  
Furthermore,  the  MAH  proposes  to  revise  the  paediatric  information  in  various  sections  of  the  SmPC, 
following  the  completion  of  Study  CSL-CT-08-52  in  children  ≤12  years  old  with  VWD.  Additionally,  an 
abbreviated study report summarising the results of the discontinued study on immune tolerance induction 
(ITI) treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex (study CSLCT-BIO-10-67) was provided to the 
EMA in June 2014 via an Article 46 submission to update the dossier accordingly. 
This application proposes changes in the following main areas of the SmPC. 
- 
The currently approved  VWD indication: 
“Treatment of haemorrhage or prevention and treatment of surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when 
desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated”  is revised as follows: 
“Prophylaxis and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin 
(DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated.” 
- 
Posology section: 
As the approved indication so far does not specify age, only a statement in SPC Section 4.2 that “The safety 
and efficacy of Voncento in children <12 years have not been established. No data are available.” 
The MAH proposes to modify SPC Section 4.2 so that this statement only refers to haemophilia A and to 
include statements on dosing which would be applicable to paediatric patients from age 1 year and older. 
Paediatric development 
A Paediatric Investigation plan (PIP) has been approved by the PDCO with modifications (P/0123/2014), in 
May  2014.  In  accordance  with  the  PIP,  this  post-approval  variation  presents  data  from  clinical  studies 
performed  by  CSL  with  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF,  including  new  data  on  the  on-demand  and 
prophylaxis treatment in children with VWD. 
The  following  waiver  was  agreed  on  the  grounds  that  clinical  studies  could  not  be  expected  to  be  of 
significant therapeutic benefit to or fulfil a therapeutic need of the paediatric population: 
− 
In the treatment of hereditary Factor VIII deficiency (Haemophilia A) 
The waiver applies to infants from birth to less than 28 days;-  
Deferral of completion 
Deferral has been agreed on the completion of 3 studies in children under 12 years. Data from two of these 
studies  (CSLCT–BIO-08-52  and  the  terminated  study  CSLCT–BIO-10-67)  were  submitted  during  this 
procedure.  In  accordance  with  the  PIP,  paediatric  data  regarding  children  aged  <12 years  with 
haemophilia A from the ongoing clinical study (CSLCT–BIO-08-53) will be submitted after finalisation of the 
study.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted – as per the initial application for the MA for 
Voncento. The MAH has not performed an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in accordance with the 
“Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  the  medicinal  products  for  human  use” 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015

(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) – as Voncento is a naturally derived substance and a protein, unlikely to result 
in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
 GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Special populations  
Paediatric population 
A paediatric PK, safety, and efficacy study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in VWD patients was submitted in support of 
the current application. A total of 17 subjects were enrolled and treated with human coagulation FVIII/VWF 
complex, 4 with a prophylaxis regimen (Arm 1) and 13 with an on-demand regimen (Arm 2). The mean age 
of the included patients was 5.2 years (age range 0-11.0 years) with 9 subjects (52.9%) aged <6 years.  
Seven subjects (41.2%) were male, 10 (58.8%) female. All but 2 subjects were Caucasian. All subjects 
participated in the initial PK assessment,  and 9 subjects with VWD Type 3 participated in the repeat PK 
assessment. All subjects completed the Month 12 visit. 
PK samples were collected immediately prior to dosing and then at 0.5, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h after the infusion. 
Samples for determination of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, and FVIII:C were taken at each PK time point. 
Descriptive statistics for the main PK parameters for baseline-adjusted VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB are 
summarised  in  table  2.  Following  infusion  with  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex,  plasma 
concentrations  of  all  VWF  markers  increased  immediately,  reaching  Cmax  at  30  min  post-dose,  and  then 
declined over time with mean terminal t1/2 of 10.3-11.5 h and MRT of 12.7-14.6 h. Profiles of concentrations 
over time were similar between VWF markers; mean baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations for VWF:RCo 
were slightly lower than for VWF:Ag and VWF:CB.

Following  repeat  treatment  with  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  at  6  months,  mean  plasma 
concentrations for all VWF markers were comparable to those from the initial PK infusion (Table 3): there 
was no evidence of alterations which would suggest the development of inhibitors to Voncento. 
Table 3: VWF PK parameters after an initial and repeat human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
administration (repeat PK population [N=9 Type 3 VWD subjects], study CSLCT-BIO-08-52) 
Due to dose calculation errors, 3 subjects received incorrect doses and had major PK deviations. For these 
subjects,  the  dose  calculation  was  erroneously  based  in  FVIII:C  instead  of  VWF:RCo,  which  led  to 
administration of higher doses instead of the prescribed dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg (195.6 and 198.2 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg at initial and repeat PK; 157.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg and 157.4 IU VWF:RCo/kg at initial PK ). To

minimize the interference from inaccurate dosing, another set of PK parameters was generated by excluding 
these 3 subjects. Compared to the full PK dataset, incremental recovery, t1/2, Cl, and Vss were similar. AUC 
and Cmax were lower compared with the full PK population; this was attributable to the high doses in the 3 
excluded subjects.  
Comparison of the PK for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB obtained in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 
with PK data obtained in adults in Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (Table 4), shows that VWF PK parameters, such 
as incremental recovery are higher in VWD patients > 12 years, yielding increased  Cmax and AUC, in the 
>12 years population as compared to the >6 and 6 < 12 years population. In line with this, t1/2 generally 
appears longer in the >12 years population as compared to the <6 years and 6 < 12 years population.

Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
In order to characterise the PK of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in adult and paediatric populations 
with  VWD  PK  data  obtained  from  pivotal  VWD  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-54,  were 
combined in a population PK analyses. Next to the type of VWD, only weight appears to be a significant 
covariate.  Weight  was  shown  a  covariate  both  for  V  and  Cl.  When  weight  is  included,  age  was  not  a 
significant  covariate.  The  model  was  based  on  data  obtained  in  adults  (CSLCT-BIO-08-54)  as  well  as  in 
paediatric patients (Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52).  
Model-predicted  VWF:RCo  exposures  vs  age  were  conducted  using  the  population  PK  model  which 
incorporated weight on CL and V, model-predicted AUC and Cmax were obtained by non-compartmental 
calculations of model-derived (post-hoc) VWF:RCo concentrations predicted individually for each PK sample 
time point. Thus, predictions of VWF:RCo exposures for different ages after an initial dose were possible due 
to the presence of weight in the model. There is a consistent pattern in this relationship when comparing the 
observed  exposures  versus  age  to  the  model  predicted  exposures  versus  weight.  In  addition,  it  can  be 
observed that VFW:RCo exposure appeared to modestly decrease when age was less than 6 years old. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A paediatric PK, safety, and efficacy study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in VWD patients was submitted in support of 
the current application. This paediatric study was compliant with the requirements of the CHMP guideline on 
the clinical investigation of human plasma-derived VWF products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02) and the guideline 
on the Core SmPC for human plasma derived VWF (CPMP/BPWG/278/02).   
Overall, the pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients with von Willebrand disease are very similar to those 
observed in the adult population. 
PK of single dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight was evaluated in paediatric subjects less than 12 years 
of age with severe VWD. Following infusion, peak concentrations of VWF markers (VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and 
VWF:CB) and FVIII:C were achieved immediately with a mean IR of 0.013-0.016 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for VWF 
markers and 0.017-0.021 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for FVIII:C. The elimination t1/2 of VWF markers was between 
9.7 and 12.9 h whereas FVIII:C had a longer t1/2 of approximately 18 h due to a plateau effect that may 
represent the net effect of decreasing levels of exogenous FVIII, combined with increasing endogenous FVIII 
levels. PK parameters from the repeat PK evaluation were similar to those from initial PK. Voncento exposure 
and disposition were comparable between <6-year-old and 6-12-year-old subjects.

Page 14/68 
 
  
  
 
 
 
However,  PK  parameters  such  as  incremental  recovery  are  higher  in  VWD  patients  >  12  years,  yielding 
increased Cmax and AUC, in the >12 years population as compared to the <6 and 6- 12 years population. 
In line with this, t1/2 generally appears longer in the >12 years population as compared to the <6 years and 
6-12 years population.   
The VWF and FTVIII PK data in VWD patients < 6 years and 6 -12 years are summarised in the SmPC, in 
order to provide relevant information to prescribers (see section 5.2). 
Dosing errors were made in 3 out of 17 paediatric subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52. For these subjects, 
the dose calculation was erroneously based in FVIII:C instead of VWF:RCo, which led to administration of 
higher doses instead of the prescribed dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg. The impact of these dosing errors on the 
PK  conclusions  appears  limited  based  on  the  sensitivity  analysis  conducted.  The  MAH  agreed  to  include 
medication  errors  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  The  risk  will  be  monitored  through  routine 
pharmacovigilance, and any new data on the potential risk will be reviewed in the upcoming PSURs (see also 
RMP). 
The  population  pharmacokinetic  model  appears  to  be  sufficiently  validated  and  to  provide  a  reasonable 
description  of  the  VWF:RCo,  VWF:Ag  and  VWF:CB  pharmacokinetics.  In  the  observed  VWF 
plasma-concentration  time  plots,  provided  in  the  report  for  Population  PK  study  RA21020033,  it  was 
apparent  that  the  AUC  and  Cmax  seem  higher  in  the  adult  population  as  compared  to  the  <12  years 
population,  as  noted  in  in  the  discussion  of  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52.  VWF  incremental  recovery  and 
exposure in the VWD paediatric population <12 years seems to be lower than in VWD patients >12 years. 
The provided data confirm that dosing based on weight is appropriate. Further, the predicted exposures are 
reasonably in line with observed exposures. Dose/kg-normalised AUC and Cmax are somewhat lower in the 
population <12 years, as compared to the population > 12 years. This lower exposure should be indicated 
in the SmPC. It is acknowledged that the lower incremental recovery in VWF patients < 12 years supports 
the higher dose used in this population as compared to the > 12 years population.  
Final  dosing  recommendations  based  on  the  above  results  have  been  agreed  in  the  SmPC  (see  also 
discussion on Clinical Efficacy): 
Prophylaxis treatment 
For long term prophylaxis in patients with VWD, a dose of 25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo /kg body weight should be 
considered at a frequency of 1 to 3 times per week. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeds or menorrhagia, 
shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. The dose and duration of treatment will depend on 
the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels.  
Paediatric VWD population  
Treatment of bleeding 
Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of body 
weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed.  
Prophylaxis treatment 
Patients aged 12 to 18 years old: Dosing is based on the same guidelines as for adults.  
Patients aged <12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 years 
of age were shown to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 – 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2). 
The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo 
and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic data submitted in support of this variation are satisfactory.

The PK analysis, including the data from the 17 subjects <12 years, confirms that VWF incremental recovery 
and  exposure  in  the  VWD  paediatric  population  <12  years  is  lower  than  in  VWD  patients  >12  years, 
supporting the higher prophylactic dose used in this population as compared to the > 12 years population. 
Recommendations have been included in the SmPC Section 4.2 accordingly.  
The VWF and FTVIII PK data in VWD patients < 6 years and 6 years < 12 years are summarised in the SmPC, 
section 5.2 in order to provide relevant information to prescribers. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54 
This was a Phase II/III, multi-centre, open-label study to assess the PK, efficacy, and safety of Voncento in 
subjects  with  severe  VWD.  As  pivotal  trial  for  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Voncento  in  VWD,  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54 has been described in detail for the MAA. Only information necessary for understanding 
the claimed extension of the indication to routine prophylaxis are presented in this assessment report. 
Altogether, the study consisted of 3 periods: 
• Screening period of up to 28 days. 
• PK component of up to 183 days (PK subjects). 
• Efficacy component with 3 arms:  
Arm1 Prophylaxis (only one subject enrolled), Arm 2 On-demand treatment of bleeding events and Arm 3  in 
which subjects could continue in order to obtain routine prophylaxis after completing Arm 2. 
Concerning routine prophylaxis, in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 one patient was treated from the start with a 
routine prophylaxis regimen in Arm 1 and 8 subjects from Arm 2 continued into Arm 3 in which they received 
a routine prophylaxis regimen. 
Methods CSLCT-BIO-08-54

3. Where DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available. 
4. Required a VWF product for prophylactic therapy or to control an NSB event. 
Main Exclusion criteria 
Subjects who fulfilled any of the following criteria were not eligible for inclusion into this study: 
For participants of the PK component:

1. Were actively bleeding immediately prior to the initial PK period. 
2. Received DDAVP or a VWF product in the 5 days prior to their first dose of study product. 
3. Had Type 2B, 2N, or 2M VWD. 
For all subjects: 
4. Required a VWF product for a planned surgical procedure at enrolment i.e. a planned surgery should not 
have been the reason for inclusion into the study. 
5. Received aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 7 days prior to their first 
dose of study product. 
6. Known history of or were suspected to have VWF or FVIII inhibitors. 
Assignment to treatment arms 
Prophylaxis arm (Arm 1): Subjects who were being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF product 
at the time of study entry, or who were not on a set prophylaxis regimen but in whom prophylaxis treatment 
was justifiable in the opinion of the investigator, were enrolled into Arm 1 with a final visit after 12 months 
On-demand arm (Arm 2): Subjects who were not being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF 
product at the time of study entry, 
Arm 3: Subjects, who completed on-demand treatment in Arm 2 and who at the Month 12 visit qualified to 
be switched to a set prophylactic regimen according to the pre-specified criteria given below  entered Arm 3  
to receive prophylaxis with Voncento for 12 months. 
Eligibility to be switched to Arm 3 was assessed by the investigator using the following criteria as a guideline: 
− Joints: either ≥3 spontaneous bleeding events in the same joint or ≥3 spontaneous bleeding events in 
various joints over a 6-month period. 
− Gastrointestinal: >2 gastrointestinal bleeding events over a 12-month period. 
− Epistaxis: ≥5 severe epistaxis episodes requiring Voncento treatment or erythrocyte transfusion over a 
6-month period. 
− Menorrhagia uncontrolled by the contraceptive pill or tranexamic acid. 
− More than 1 bleeding event per month at any site requiring Voncento treatment over a 6-month period. 
− Investigator’s opinion in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
These criteria for continuation into Arm 3 reflect a clinically severe disease profile in patients likely to  benefit 
from routine prophylaxis and are considered to be appropriate. 
Treatments 
Duration of treatment was 12 months for Arm 1 and Arm 2 and 24 months for those who continued from Arm 
2 into Arm 3. 
The frequency and dose of administration during the efficacy component was determined by the investigator 
using the schedule given in Table 6 as a guide.

Table 6. Guidelines for Voncento dosage during the efficacy component 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
1. To investigate the initial and repeat PK profile of Voncento in subjects with severe VWD. 
2. To assess the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento in subjects with VWD who require a VWF product to control 
an NSB event. 
3. To assess the effectiveness of a prophylaxis regimen as compared to on-demand therapy with Voncento 
in preventing NSB events. 
Secondary objectives 
1.  To  assess  the  safety  of  Voncento  used  both  as  on-demand  therapy  to  treat  NSB  events  and  as 
prophylactic therapy. 
2. To assess the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento for subjects who undergo surgical procedures during the 
study period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoints include: 
•  Haemostatic Efficacy assessed as in table 6. 
•  Blood product transfusion requirements, and the number of treatments/units required to resolve 
any bleeding event 
•  VWF:RCo/ FVIII:C concentrate usage: number of infusions, IU/kg per dose, per event, per month 
and per year. 
•  Assessment of blood loss during any surgical procedure 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 18/68 
 
  
  
 
•  An  assessment  in  the  number  of  spontaneous  or  traumatic  NSB  events  on  a  monthly  basis  and  
overall 
Secondary endpoints include: 
1. The nature and incidence of adverse events (including the development of FVIII and/or VWF  inhibitors) 
2. Assessment of haemostatic efficacy of Voncento in usage for a surgical event according to a 4 point ordinal 
scale, need for transfusion and assessment of blood loss. 
Haemostasis assessment 
Clinical  efficacy  parameters  were  haemostasis,  number  of  bleeding  events,  study  product  usage,  blood 
product transfusion requirements, and surgeon’s assessment of blood loss during a surgical procedure. 
Haemostasis was to be assessed overall every 3 months by the investigator and monthly by the subject, and 
for each NSB and surgical event by the investigator and subject. 
Overall clinical assessments of haemostatic efficacy were done by the investigator in conjunction with the 
subject (or legal guardian) based on a 4-point efficacy grading scale outlined in Table 7. 
The severity of NSB events was assessed by the investigator as major or minor. Major NSB events included 
any bleeding into a joint or muscle, or a mucosal bleeding of the gastro-intestinal tract (excluding nasal or 
oral  bleeding).  All  other  NSB  events  were  classified  as  minor  unless  the  investigator  assessment  noted 
otherwise. 
Table 7.  Efficacy grading scales 
Sample size 
The number of subjects was based on the CHMP guideline [CPMP/BPWG/220/02] which requires at least 12 
subjects with VWD to take part in a PK study, 6 of whom should have Type 3 VWD. 
Randomisation 
The study was uncontrolled. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Continuous variables were summarised using descriptive statistics: number of non-missing values, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 19/68 
 
  
  
 
The sample size was estimated in line with the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma 
Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02). 
Per the statistical analysis plan, no formal statistical tests were to be performed but a descriptive approach 
to data analysis was used. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Twenty two (22) patients, including 3 adolescents, were treated in the study thus comprising the safety 
population. One patient was included in the prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) and 21 in the on demand arm (Arm 2). 
All patients completed the 12-month visit. The efficacy population used for the efficacy evaluation included 
all 21 patients who received study drug and had at least 1 NSB after baseline with an available haemostatic 
efficacy assessment.  
Fifteen (15) patients participated in the PK component and 8 of these, all from the on-demand arm (Arm 2) 
and all with Type 3 VWD, were assessed for the repeat PK evaluation. 
Eight (8) patients from on demand Arm 2 (but none of the adolescent subjects) including 6 with Type 3 VWD, 
entered Arm 3 thus switching to prophylaxis for 12 months. One subject (Type 3 VWD) withdrew his consent 
and  discontinued  treatment  after  10.5  months  in  Arm  3.  Thus  7  subjects  completed  the  study  after  24 
months, with 12 months on a prophylaxis regimen.

Recruitment 
A total of 22 subjects were recruited and received study drug in 6 centres. The first subject enrolled on 30 
June 2009. The last subject completed the Month 12 visit on 6 March 2011 and the last subject completed 
the Month 24 visit on 16 February 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 substantial protocol amendments and 2 protocol deviations which are not considered to have 
impacted the validity of the efficacy and safety data. 
Amendment 3 which was addition of the inclusion criterion of “DDAVP unavailable”, while allowing use of 
Voncento in a real-life situation, may have allowed inclusion of patients with milder bleeding episodes. This 
was of concern in the assessment for the MAA but it was concluded that the amendment had not negatively 
impacted the data and that efficacy of Voncento in VWD had been adequately demonstrated.   
For the assessment of the data for an indication in routine prophylaxis it is not of relevance as DDAVP would 
not be used in prophylaxis. 
Baseline data 
All subjects were Caucasian, 10 (45.5%) were male and 12 (54.5%) female, and the mean age was 33.6 
years (range: 15-68 years). Three adolescent subjects (aged 12 - <18 years) participated in Arm 2 of the 
study (2 subjects aged 15 years and 1 subject aged 16 years and none of them continued into Arm 3.

Table 9.  Von Willebrand disease history in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy results were based on the efficacy population (treated subjects who had at least 1 NSB event after 
baseline with an available haemostatic efficacy assessment).  
This consisted of 1 subject in Arm 1 (prophylaxis) and 20 subjects in Arm 2 (on-demand) in the first 12 
months of the study, and 8 subjects in Arm 3 who received prophylaxis treatment during Months 13-24 
(after being treated on-demand in Arm 2). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Study Drug Dosage 
In pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 the 20 patients in the on-demand arm (Arm 2) had a median number of 
20.0 infusions (range: 3-92). The mean (SD) average dose per infusion was 37.8 (8.7) IU VWF:RCo/kg and 
the median average dose per infusion was 36.1 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 29 - 64 IU/kg).  
The 8 subjects who later went on to prophylaxis in Arm 3, first received a higher median number of 30.5 
infusions  (range:  18  92)  at  a  median  average  dose  per  infusion  of  37.2  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  (range:  29-46 
IU/kg), during their 12 month period of on-demand treatment in Arm 2. 
On the prophylaxis regimen in Arm 3, their median number of infusions increased to 72.5 IU (range: 16-118) 
and the median average dose per infusion decreased to 28.8 IU VWF:RCo/kg. 
In prophylaxis treatment Arm 3, their median total prophylaxis dose of IMP was 1843.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
(range: 539.7 - 4110.2 IU/kg). 
The  one  patient  included  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  (Arm  1)  participated  in  the  study  for  15  months.  She 
received  197  infusions  with  37.9  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  IMP  per  infusion  administered  every  2-3  days,  and  2 
additional infusions of 55.3 and 27.7 IU VWF:RCo/kg, to treat a major mucosal NSB event. 
Her total amount of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex received 7470.7 IU VWF:RCo/kg.  
Number of bleeding events during on-demand treatment (Arm 2) 
The 20 subjects of Arm 2 reported 533 NSB events during the study, (median 19.5 NSB events per subject, 
range of 2 to 82 events (Table 9). The majority of NSB events in Arm 2 were spontaneous [99.2%]), minor 
[76.5%], and mucosal [78.2%]. Eight subjects reported 125 major NSB events. 
Six subjects had 126 NSB events that did not require treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
and which were consequently not assessed for haemostatic efficacy. 
Number of bleeding events during prophylaxis (Arm 3 and Arm 1) 
Compared  to  the  on-demand  treatment,  there  were  very  few  bleeds  experienced  by  the  subjects  on 
prophylaxis. Of the 8 subjects in Arm 3, only 5 subjects reported bleeds. There was a total of 10 bleeds in

these  5  subjects  with  a  median  number  of  1  event  (range:  1-6  events)  per  subject  during  prophylaxis 
compared to 26.5 events (range 18-82) while receiving on-demand treatment in Arm 2. 
All 10 NSB events were spontaneous, 7 were minor and 8 were mucosal. Two subjects in Arm 3 experienced 
a total of 3 major NSB events, including 1 major mucosal NSB event which was a gastrointestinal bleed and 
was treated with additional Voncento.  
The  single  subject  in  Arm  1  had  a  higher  number  of  bleeds  on  prophylaxis  than  the  subjects  in  Arm  3, 
reporting 10 NSB events during her 15-months prophylaxis. All bleeds were spontaneous and mucosal; 2 
were minor and 8 major. The subject only treated 1 major mucosal event outside of her prophylaxis regimen 
with additional human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

The number and type of bleeds experienced in Arm 2 by the 8 subjects who went on to receive prophylaxis 
is given in Table 11. 
During prophylaxis, there were 3 major bleeds in 2 subjects and 1 subject experienced 2 joint bleeds. In 
comparison, in the same 8 subjects during on-demand treatment, 5 subjects experienced a median of 7.0 
major bleeds (range 2 to 59) and 3 subjects experienced a median of  34 joint bleeds (range 7 to 58).

Haemostatic efficacy in prophylaxis: investigator and subjects’ assessment 
In Arm 3 (prophylaxis), haemostatic efficacy after treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
was assessed by the investigator as excellent in the treatment of all 10 NSB events and also generally for all 
subjects at every 3-month interval.  
All subjects in Arm 3 with an available monthly assessment also assessed the haemostatic efficacy of human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as excellent for each month.  
One patient experienced a major spontaneous mucosal bleed in the gastrointestinal tract that lasted for 3 
days  and  was  treated  with  additional  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex.  The  overall  haemostatic 
efficacy of this event was assessed as excellent by both the investigator and the subject 
While receiving on-demand treatment in Arm 2, these 8 subjects had experienced 304 bleeds including 116 
major bleeds, 99 joint bleeds and 16 muscle bleeds. Haemostatic efficacy was rated by the investigator as 
excellent in more than 98% of all bleeds. 
The single subject in Arm 1 reported haemostatic efficacy ranging as being usually excellent to moderate 
over  the  15  month  period.  Only  1  of  the  10  bleeds  she  experienced  was  treated  with  additional  human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and efficacy for this event was reported as good by both the investigator and 
subject. Haemostatic efficacy ranged from excellent to moderate over the 15 month period. Only 1 of the 10 
bleeds she experienced was treated with additional human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and efficacy for 
this event was reported as good by both the investigator and patient.

Ancillary analyses 
The MAH  presented an analysis of subjects who switched from on-demand (Arm 2) to prophylaxis treatment 
(Arm 3) compared to those who did not switch. 
The  sub-group  of  patients  who  went  on  to  routine  prophylaxis  in  Arm  3  had  more  severe  disease  as 
evidenced by the higher median number of bleeding events (26.5, range 18 to 82) of which more than one 
third were rated as major. In comparison those subjects who did not go on to routine prophylaxis had a lower 
number of bleeds (median 12, range 2 to 69) and only 9% of bleeds were major. This would be in keeping 
with  the  higher  proportion  of  subjects  with  Type  3  VWD  amongst  those  who  went  on  to  receive  routine 
prophylaxis. 
It is notable that haemostatic efficacy was more often reported as excellent (98.4% of bleeds) in Arm 2 in 
those who went on to routine prophylaxis compared to 73.8% of bleeds in those not considered suitable for 
routine prophylaxis. It can be speculated that this may reflect a choice of the investigator in choosing those 
who responded well to treatment with Voncento to go on to routine prophylaxis.  
Overall  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  routine  prophylaxis  treatment  regimen  was  very  successful  in 
preventing all types (i.e. mucosal, joint and muscle) of spontaneous bleeding events. 
Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 
This was a Phase III, multi-centre, open-label study to investigate the PK, efficacy, and safety of Voncento 
in  paediatric  subjects  with  VWD  in  whom  treatment  with  a  VWF  product  was  required  for  prophylactic 
therapy,  haemostatic  control  during  surgery,  or  control  of  a  non-surgical,  spontaneous,  or  traumatic 
bleeding event. 
The  Applicant  has  submitted  the  PDCO  Opinion  on  compliance  by  20/06/2014  in  which  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52 was considered to be compliant. 
Methods  
Study participants 
Main Inclusion criteria 
Subjects who fulfilled the following criteria were eligible for inclusion: 
1. Male and female subjects between 0 and <12 years of age. 
2. Subjects who had been diagnosed with VWD Type 1, 2A, or 3. 
3. Subjects where DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available. 
4. Subjects with a VWF:RCo <20% at Screening (after a minimum of 5 days since last VWF treatment) or 
subjects who had a history of VWF:RCo <10% documented in their medical notes at enrolment. 
Main Exclusion criteria 
These  were  essentially  the  same  as  for  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  with  the  exception  that  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54  having  Type  2B,  2N,  or  2M  VWD  was  an  exclusion  criterion.    However,  for  this  study 
(CSLCT-BIO-08-52) a diagnosis of VWD Type 1, 2A, or 3 is defined as inclusion criterion.

Treatments 
Duration of treatment, either on-demand or prophylaxis was to be 12 months. The frequency and dose of 
Voncento  administration  was  determined  by  the  investigator.  The  schedule  described  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54 was used to guide dosage. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives: 
• To assess the efficacy of Voncento in paediatric subjects with VWD. 
• To investigate the PK profile of Voncento in paediatric subjects with VWD. 
Secondary objective: 
• To assess the safety of Voncento in paediatric subjects with VWD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: 
•  Subjective  assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  in  its  usage  with  an  NSB  event,  surgical 
procedure, or use in a prophylaxis regimen. 
• PK parameters for each  VWF and  FVIII  were derived from plasma concentration values after an initial 
single dose of Voncento on Day 1. Parameters were also determined 6 months after the initial dose in Type 
3 VWD subjects (repeat PK, recovery study). 
• Assessment of response was to include the above assessments as well as haemostasis during surgical 
procedure, blood loss, and transfusion requirements. 
Secondary endpoints listed by severity and relationship to Voncento: 
• The nature and incidence of AEs  
• The development of FVIII and / or VWF inhibitors. 
Haemostasis assessment 
Please refer to study CSLCT-BIO-08-54. 
Sample size 
The number of patients was based on the CHMP guideline CPMP/BPWG/220/02 which requires at least 12 
subjects  with  VWD  to  take  part  in  the  PK  study,  this  number  should  ensure  a  minimum  of  8  evaluable 
subjects fulfilling the following conditions: 
•  At least 3 patients with Type 3 VWD and at least 6 subjects aged between 0 and 6 years. 
•  At study start, only children of ≥6 years of age were to be included; younger children were included 
after at least 3 subjects of ≥6 years had been enrolled.  
•  At least 5 investigational sites were to be involved.

Baseline data 
The mean age of the 17 patients was 5.2 years with 9 (52.9%) aged <6 years. All but 2 were Caucasian. 
Demographics were similar between treatment arms with the exception that all 4 patients in prophylaxis 
Arm 1 were male and a higher proportion of Arm 1 patients (75%) were <6 years old (Table 12). 
Overall, 7 patients (41.2%) had Type 2A VWD and the remaining 10 patients had Type 3 VWD, 3 in Arm1 and 
7 in Arm 2) (Table 13). One patient was excluded from the efficacy population because he did not experience 
a NSB.

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy results were based on the efficacy population (treated subjects who had at least 1 NSB event after 
baseline with an available haemostatic efficacy assessment) that included 16 subjects: 4 subjects in Arm 1 
(prophylaxis) and 12 subjects in Arm 2 (on-demand). One subject in Arm 2 was excluded from the efficacy 
population because he did not experience any NSB events during the study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Prophylaxis Regimen 
Study Drug Dosage 
In Arm 1 (prophylaxis), subjects received a median number of 137.5 infusions at a median average human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex dose of 62.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg per infusion. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 29/68 
 
  
  
 
In Arm 1, a median of 119 IMP infusions (range: 45-161) were administered as prophylaxis, and a median 
of 17 (8-41) to treat a bleeding event.  
The majority of bleeding events required 1 infusion (71 [78.0%]) of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
and 18 events [19.8%] required none.  
There was a large total number of infusions in Arm 1, including infusions given for prophylaxis and for the 
treatment of bleeding events. The MAH has confirmed that the mean and median prophylactic doses used in 
these children were approximately 60 IU/kg and that the frequency of administration ranged from 1 to 3 
times a week. (See Table 14 below) 
Table 14. Prophylactic frequency and doses in children <12 years old (CSLCT-BIO-08-52 
This median average dose of approximately 60 IU/kg is much higher than the dosage guidance of 25 to 40 
IU/kg  originally  proposed  to  be  recommended  for  routine  prophylaxis  for  all  ages  in  the  SmPC.  The  PK 
analysis in the response of the MAH to the RfSI, confirms that VWF incremental recovery and exposure in the 
VWD paediatric population <12 years is lower than in VWD patients >12 years, supporting the higher dose 
used in this population as compared to the > 12 years population. 
Number of bleeding events 
The 4 subjects on prophylaxis experienced a total of 91 NSB, with a median per subject of 23.5 NSB events 
(Table 15). The majority of these events were spontaneous (79.1%), minor (96.7%), mucosal (87.9%). 
There  were  3  major  NSB  events,  of  which  1  was  a  major  mucosal  bleed  and  there  were  no  surgeries. 
Eighteen NSB events (19.8%) did not require treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and 
were therefore not assessed for haemostatic efficacy.

Three  of  these  4  subjects  were  already  on  a  prophylaxis  regimen  at  study  entry  and  had  reported  very 
frequent minor or some major bleeding events in their medical history that justified the decision to continue 
with the prophylaxis regimen during this study. 
The number of bleeding events reported during prophylaxis in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 is actually higher, 
with a mean and median of approximately 23 bleeds in 12 months, compared to the mean and median of 14 
bleeds in the 12 months prior to study entry (Note: In the response to the RfSI the MAH has clarified that one 
of these subjects (071105) had been receiving on-demand treatment and not prophylaxis in the 12 months 
prior to study entry and had experienced 2 bleeds in that time.) 
In the prophylaxis arm, there were 3 major bleeds  and 3 joint bleeds in the 4 subjects whereas in the 
on-demand treatment arm (Arm 2),  the 12 subjects experienced 26 major bleeding events (median per 
subject  2.0 major bleeds [range 0 to 9]) and 11 joint bleeds (median per subject 4.0 [range 0 to 9]). 
Compared to the 12 months on a prophylactic regimen prior to entry to study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the number 
of bleeding events per individual during the 12 months on Voncento was rather similar in 2 of the 3 subjects 
concerned (from 28 to 34 and from 19 to 14). It was higher in one subject (from 9 to 35) than in the 12 
months prior to study entry. 
Haemostatic efficacy in prophylaxis: investigator’s and subject’s assessment 
The haemostatic efficacy for the 73 bleeding events was assessed by the investigator as excellent for 59 
events (80.8%) and as good for the remaining 14 events (19.2%) (Table 14). This was also the case for the 
different types, locations and severities of bleeds, with the exception of the 3 major NSB events, where 1 
event (the only major mucosal event)  was assessed as excellent and the other 2 (66.7%) as good. 
The  haemostatic efficacy  for each 3-month interval  was assessed by the investigator as either excellent 
(≥50.0% of subjects) or good.

Subjects  rated  the  haemostatic  efficacy  as  excellent  for  the  majority  of  months  during  which  a  bleed 
occurred and for the majority of bleeding days and as good for the rest. 
Overall  clinically  adequate  haemostatic  efficacy  has  been  shown  in  the  treatment  of  breakthrough  or 
traumatic  bleeds  occurring  during  prophylaxis  and  it  is  noted  that  for  major  bleeds  and  joint  bleeds, 
haemostatic efficacy was rated as good in most cases and rated as excellent in only 1 bleed.

The haemostatic efficacy per individual was also provided.  
For  2  of  the  subjects  on  prophylaxis  during  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52,  no  treatment  was  required  for 
approximately one third of their minor bleeds and  for one subject 9% of the  minor bleeds did not need 
treatment. Overall, a higher percentage of bleeds did not require treatment with Voncento in patients on 
prophylaxis compared to patients receiving only on-demand trteatment where is was 16.7% of bleeds (see 
below).    The  one  subject  who  needed  additional  treatment  for  all  minor  bleeds  during  prophylaxis  was 
receiving a prophylactic dose of 46 IU/kg VWF:RCo twice weekly, but had only experienced 8 minor bleeds.

Study Drug Dosage 
In  Arm  2,  subjects  received  overall  a  median  number  of  8.0  infusions  at  a  median  average  human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex dose of 50.9 IU VWF:RCo/kg per infusion. (The assessor concludes that his 
median dose apparently includes the dose given for PK assessment (n=13).)  In the response to the RfSI, 
the MAH has clarified the doses given only for the treatment of bleeds. 
The mean (± s.d.) number of bleeds in the 12 subjects in Arm 2 of paediatric Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in 
patients <12 years was 8.0 (±6.4) and the median was 5.5 (range 1 to 22) (Table 15). 
The per patient mean dose actually used for the treatment of bleeding in the on-demand arm (n=12) of 
paediatric  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  in  patients  <12  years  ranged  from  approximately  35  to  70  IU/kg 
VWF:RiCo and the per patient median dose ranged from approximately 30 to 80 IU/kg VWF:RiCo.  Over all 
the 12 subjects, the average dose (± s.d.) was 47.6 (± 16.8) IU/kg VWF:RiCo and the median dose was 40.8 
(range 30.2 to 88.6) IU/kg VWF:RiCo (See Table 19 below). 
These doses are within the range of 40 to 80 IU/kg currently recommended in the Voncento SmPC for the 
treatment of bleeding and which the MAH also proposes for the paediatric population. 
Table 19. On demand doses in children <12 years old (CSLCT-BIO-08-52) 
In Arm 2, the majority of bleeding events were treated with only 1 infusion (55 [57.3%]) and 16 events 
[16.7%] were not treated with human coagulation FVIII/VWF. 25 NSB events (26.0%) required >1 infusion. 
Haemostatic efficacy in on-demand treatment: investigator’s and subject’s assessment 
Haemostatic  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  for  all  the  80  events  as  excellent  for  36  events 
(45.0%)  and  as  good  for  the  remaining  44  events  (55.0%)  (Table  16).  This  was  also  the  case  for  the 
different types, locations and severities of bleeds with the exception of the 11 joint bleeding events, where 
the haemostatic efficacy of a relatively higher proportion of events was assessed as good (81.8%).

For each 3-month interval, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator as either excellent or 
good.   
The haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the subject as excellent for 33 bleeding days (60.0%), as good for 
12 bleeding days (21.8%), and as moderate for the remaining 10 bleeding days (18.2%) . There were 13 
major mucosal bleeds in 5 subjects. The overall haemostatic efficacy for these 13 events was assessed by 
the investigator as excellent for 9 cases and as good for 4 cases. The subjects rated the haemostatic efficacy 
as excellent for the same 9 events and as good for the remaining 2 events, for which a subject assessment 
is available.

The efficacy population included 8 subjects each in the subgroup of <6-year-old subjects (3 in Arm 1 and 5 
in Arm 2)  and that of ≥6-year-old subjects ( 1 in Arm 1 and 7 in Arm 2). 
As in the overall efficacy population, in both age subgroups, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the

Note:  Percentages were based on  the  number of  bleeding events of  the  considered  type  with  available  investigator’s 
assessment.  Bleeding  events  with  missing  investigator’s  assessment  for  efficacy  were  not  considered  for  this  table. 
Bleeding events for which no Voncento treatment was needed were not considered for this table. 
Source: Table 14.2.3.1 
In  Arm  1,  the  distribution  of  efficacy  ratings  of  excellent  and  good  across  bleeding  event  categories 
(spontaneous, trauma, post-surgery, major, minor, joint, mucosal, muscle and other) was similar between 
age subgroups (Table 24) and also compared to the overall efficacy population (Table 17 and Table 21, 
respectively). 
In Arm 2, the distribution of efficacy ratings of excellent and good across bleeding event categories was also 
similar between age subgroups with the exception of traumatic bleeds (80% excellent haemostatic efficacy 
rating in children < 6 years compared to 46.2% in children aged ≥ 6 years) and major bleeds (80% excellent 
haemostatic efficacy rating in children < 6 years compared to 31.3 % in children aged ≥ 6 years).  
For major and traumatic bleeds, there seems to be higher haemostatic efficacy in children < 6 years than in 
children  ≥  6  years  but  considering  the  small  populations  and  potential    inter-individual  variation  in 
pharmacokinetics no great significance can de attached to this observation. 
VWD type (Type 2A versus Type 3) 
The efficacy population included 7 subjects with VWD Type 2A (1 in Arm 1 and 6 in Arm 2) and 9 subjects 
with VWD Type 3 (3 in Arm 1 and 6 in Arm 2). 
As in the overall efficacy population, in both VWD type  subgroups, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by 
the investigator as either excellent or good for each 3-month interval and for each NSB event treated with 
Voncento (Table 22).  
Also, for both VWD Type 2A and Type 3, the haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the subject as either 
excellent or good for each study month.

Table  22.  Investigator’s  assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy  per  bleeding  event  by  treatment 
arm and VWD Type subgroup (efficacy population) 
In subjects with Type 2A VWD, all except 2 bleeds that occurred in the single subject on prophylaxis in Arm 
1  were  minor  mucosal  bleeds  (see  table).    In  the  6  subjects  with  Type  2A  VWD  receiving  on-demand 
treatment in Arm 2, the majority of bleeds were also minor mucosal bleeds (30/38 events) but it is of note 
that  8/38 events were major mucosal bleeds.  
In Arm 2, Type 3 subjects in contrast to with Type 2A, had a higher frequency of traumatic bleeds (15/42, 
36% vs 3/38, 8%), of major bleeds (18/42, 43% vs 8/38,21%) and of  joint bleeds (10/42, 24% vs 1/38, 
3%) with correspondingly less mucosal bleeds. This pattern of type of bleeds matches that expected from 
current knowledge of VWD sub-types. 
Importantly, efficacy was rated as excellent for 9 of 13 major mucosal bleeds, which are often difficult to 
treat, in subjects with Type 2A VWD.

Design 
This  is  a  Phase  II/III,  multicentre,  open-label,  uncontrolled  study  to  assess  the  PK, 
efficacy, and safety of Voncento in subjects with severe VWD.  
Main Inclusion criteria were: 
-Male and female subjects ≥12 years of age,  
-Severe VWD where VWF:RCo was <15% at screening (after a minimum of 5 days since 
last VWF treatment) or the subject had a history of VWF:RCo <10% documented in their 
medical notes at enrolment. 
-DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available. 
-Patients requiring a VWF product for prophylactic therapy or to control an NSB event. 
Altogether, the study consisted of 3 periods: 
1. Screening period of up to 28 days. 
2. PK component of up to 183 days (PK subjects), which consisted of: 
A  single dose of Voncento on Day 1 
A repeat single dose of Voncento on Day 180, at least 6 months after the initial infusion 
(repeat PK for Type 3 VWD PK subjects only).  
PK samples were collected on Days 1, 2, 3, and 4, and on Days 180, 181, 182, and 183. 
All PK subjects were to enter the efficacy component of the study at the completion of the 
initial PK period.

Excellent in 480/606 (79.1%); Good in 104/606 (17.2%); Moderate in 21/606 (3.5%). 
For 1 bleeding day (0.2%), the subject assessed the haemostatic efficacy as “none” 
Number  of  Bleeding  Events  During  the  Study:  Total  number  and  number  per 
subject 
The 20 subjects of Arm 2 (on-demand) reported a total of 533 NSB events during the 
study, The majority of NSB events were spontaneous (529 [99.2%]), minor (408 [76.5%]), 
mucosal (417 [78.2%]), and were treated at home (381 [71.5]). 
In Arm 2, 8 subjects experienced a total of 125 major NSB

Subject’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event, all days  
The  haemostatic  efficacy  was    assessed  as  excellent  by  the  subjects  for  all  bleeding 
days. 
Number  of  Bleeding  Events  During  the  Study:  Total  number  and  number  per 
subject 
Of the 8 subjects in Arm 3 (prophylaxis), 5 subjects experienced NSB events; 1 subject 
had  6  events  and  the  remaining  4  subjects  1  event  each  .  All  10  events  were 
spontaneous and treated at home; 7 were minor and 8 were mucosal. Two subjects in 
Arm 3 experienced a total of 3 major NSB events, including 1 major mucosal NSB event. 
Prophylaxis Arm 1 patient 
The single subject in Arm 1 reported 10 NSB events all of which were spontaneous and 
mucosal; 2 were minor and 8 major. 
Only 1 of these 10 events. a major mucosal event, was treated with additional FVIII/VWF 
complex  at home and  the haemostatic efficacy for this event was reported as good by 
both the investigator and subject. 
Blood Transfusion 
Only 1 subject in the efficacy population required any blood product transfusion:  
An  18-year-old  female  required  600  mL  of  packed  RBCs  each  for  2  cases  of  major 
uterine bleeding.

VWF treatment) or subjects who had a history of VWF:RCo <10% documented in their 
medical notes at enrolment.. 
Altogether, the study consisted of 3 periods: 
1. Screening period of up to 35 days. 
2. PK period consisting of 2 parts: 
• Part 1 (initial PK): single dose of Voncento on Day 1. 
PK samples collected on Days 1, 2, and 3. 
• Part 2 (repeat PK): recovery study in Type 3 VWD subjects to occur 6 months after Part 
1. On completion of Part 1 of the PK component, all subjects were to immediately enter the 
treatment period of the study. 
3. Treatment period (efficacy component with 2 arms) of up to 12 months.

Analysis description 
Primary  Analysis 
Analysis population  
Efficacy results were based on the efficacy population (treated subjects who had at least 
1  NSB  event  after  baseline  with  an  available  haemostatic  efficacy  assessment)  that 
included  16  subjects:  4  subjects  in  Arm  1  (prophylaxis)  and  12  subjects  in  Arm  2 
(on-demand). One subject in Arm 2 was excluded from the efficacy population because 
he did not experience any NSB events during the study

Primary Analysis 
On-demand Arm 2 
Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per bleeding event 
There was a haemostatic efficacy assessment  in all 80 events as follows: 
Excellent in 36/80 (45.0%); Good in  44/80 (55.0%). 
Subject’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event, all days  
Excellent for 33/55 bleeding days (60.0%),  good for 12/55 bleeding days (21.8%), and  
moderate for the remaining 10 bleeding days. 
Number  of  Bleeding  Events  During  the  Study:  Total  number  and  number  per 
subject 
The  12  subjects  of  Arm  2  (on-demand)  experienced  a  total  of  96  NSB  events.  The 
majority were spontaneous (77.1%), minor (72.9%), mucosal (82.3%), and were treated 
at home (53.1%).  A total of 26 events (27.1%) were considered major, including 13 major 
mucosal NSB events. Sixteen NSB events (16.7%) did not require treatment with human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex; these events were therefore considered not evaluable 
and consequently not assessed for haemostatic efficacy. 
Prophylaxis  Arm 1 
Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per bleeding event 
The  haemostatic  efficacy  for  the  73  bleeding  events  treated  with  human  coagulation 
FVIII/VWF complex was assessed by the investigator as excellent for 59 events (80.8%) 
and as good for the remaining 14 events (19.2%) 
Subject’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event, all days  
The haemostatic efficacy was assessed as excellent for 60/76  bleeding days (78.9%) 
and as good for the remaining 16 bleeding days (21.1%). 
Number  of  Bleeding  Events  During  the  Study:  Total  number  and  number  per 
subject 
The 4 subjects in Arm 1 (prophylaxis) experienced a total of 91 NSB events, The majority 
of  these  events  were  spontaneous  (79.1%),  minor  (96.7%),  mucosal  (87.9%),  and 
treated  at  home  (79.1%);  3  events  (3.3%)  were  major,  of  which  1  event  was  a  major 
mucosal NSB event. 
Blood Transfusion 
No subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 required blood product transfusions during the 
treatment period.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Prospective  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  (adults  and  adolescents),  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  (paediatrics  below  12 
years of age), and CSLCT-BIO-03-97 (adults and children) provide efficacy data on the treatment of VWD 
with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex both as prophylaxis and on demand therapy: 
Prophylaxis therapy: 
9 subjects (Arms 1 and 3) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54; 
4 subjects (Arm 1) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52; 
4 subjects in CSLCT-BIO-03-97. 
On-demand therapy: 
20 subjects (Arm 2) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54; 
12 subjects (Arm  2) in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52; 
19 subjects in CSLCT-BIO-03-97.  
Study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 mainly provides efficacy data on the treatment for surgical events and supportive 
data from 4 subjects receiving prophylaxis treatment. 
The  investigator-led  studies  provide  supportive  information  on  the  treatment  of  VWD  with  human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as on-demand therapy. The Shortt study contributes supportive data on 
surgical events in adults and the Howman study supportive data on NSB and surgical events in paediatric 
patients. 
Prophylaxis Regimen 
The data from study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and CSLCT-BIO-08-54 provide a comparison between prophylaxis in 
children < 12 years old and adults. There are no data on prophylaxis in the paediatric population aged ≥12 
years to 18 years. 
Number of Non-surgical Bleeding Events 
There  were  considerably  more  bleeding  events  during  prophylaxis  reported  in  paediatric  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (91 events in 4 subjects; median 23.5, range 9 to 35 ) than in the adults on prophylaxis 
in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (10 events in 8 subjects in Arm 3; median 1.0, range 1 to 6). The single subject 
in Arm 1 reported 10 bleeds over 12 months (Table 21). 
In the prophylaxis arm of paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, there were 3 major bleeds in the 4 subjects 
(one major bleed in each of 3 subjects) and 3 joint bleeds in the 4 subjects. 
For comparison, in prophylaxis Arm 3 of study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54, there were  altogether 3 major bleeds 
experienced by 2 of the 8 subjects and 2 joint bleeds in one subject. 
The MAH suggests that the higher number of bleeds per patient in children <12 years old may be due to the 
generally high variability in bleeding tendency among VWD patients (e.g., some patients are more prone to 
oral mucosal bleedings than others), but also due to the higher activity in children, which may result in more 
injuries,  compared  with  adults;  20.9%  of  bleeding  events  in  Arm  1  of  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  were 
trauma-induced compared with none in the Arm 3 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54. 
Haemostatic Efficacy in Non-surgical Bleeding Events occurring during prophylaxis 
In study paediatric CSLCT-BIO-08-52, 73 of the 91 events and in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, all 10 bleeds 
were treated with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 44/68 
 
  
  
 
 
In both studies, the haemostatic efficacy of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex per bleeding event was 
assessed  as  either  excellent  (90.9%  of  bleeds  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  and  80.8%  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52) or good. (Table 21). Haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeds occurring during 
prophylaxis was thus globally equivalent in the paediatric and adult subjects, 
In supportive study CSLCT-BIO-03-97, the 3 adult subjects receiving prophylaxis treatment reported overall 
a higher number of bleeds (22) than those in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54: 1 subject each with 1, 3, and 17 
bleeding events, respectively, over a period of 12 months, and the 4th subject was a 3 year old with 1 minor 
bleeding event over a period of 6 months. The investigator made a retrospective assessment of haemostatic 
efficacy  in  these  patients  at  the  three  monthly  follow-up  visits  and  efficacy  was  on  all  occasions  was 
considered to be good or excellent.

On-demand regimen 
Haemostatic Efficacy during the on-demand regimen 
Overall, the majority of events in the pivotal studies were assessed with either excellent or good haemostatic 
efficacy: 98.3% in study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, 100% in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52. This was also the 
case in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 where there were only 4 bleeds in 6 subjects. In the Howman study in 43 
paediatric subjects aged 5 months to 17.5 years there were 72 bleeds, with an assessment of excellent in 
approximately 80% good in approximately 18% and moderate in the rest.

Clinical studies in special populations 
In the prophylaxis arms (Arm 3 and Arm 1) of Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, all 8 patients were older than 18 
years of age, mean 43.0 (s.d, 15.9) years, median 42.5 (range 21 to 68 years). 
Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 was specifically performed in children < 12 years old. 
There were no further studies or data in special populations relevant to this procedure. 
Supportive studies 
Supportive data relevant to this procedure was available from studies CSLCT-BIO-03-97 and the Howman 
study - Howman et al (2011). The Shortt study (2007) was an investigator led study which retrospectively 
assessed the efficacy and safety of Voncento in VWD patients undergoing invasive procedures or surgery. 
CSLCT-BIO-03-97 
All but one of the 23 subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 were adults and the study provided principally 
efficacy and safety data on the use of Voncento in surgery with some data on non-surgical bleeding events 
and data on routine prophylaxis in 4 subjects.   
The dosage guideline for prophylaxis was 20 - 50 IU/kg 2 to 3 times per week. All four prophylactic patients 
had at least one episode of spontaneous bleeding such as epistaxis or bleeding into joints (elbow, shoulder 
and ankle). Patient 06-A353 was known to play contact sport during the study and had 17 single episodes of 
bleeding either due to trauma (four events) or spontaneous bleeding.  The four patients’ diary cards were 
reviewed  every  3  months,  and  at  each  of  these  follow-up  visits  the  investigator  made  a  retrospective 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015

assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy.  On  all  occasions,  haemostatic  efficacy  was  considered  by  the 
investigator to be Good or Excellent. 
The three adult patients received prophylaxis for 12 months. 
The 3-year-old boy (Subject 10A354) included in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 was the only paediatric subject in 
the study and he was on prophylaxis treatment, which he received for >5 months. He experienced 1 minor 
bleeding event at the left ankle that did not require any corrective therapy. 
Howman study   
The investigator-led study reported by Howman et al (2011) retrospectively assessed the efficacy and safety 
of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in children and adolescents with VWD treated for surgery, NSB 
events, or continuous prophylaxis from April 2003 to February 2008. 
The study included 25 males and 18 females paediatric patients with a median age of 10 years amd a range 
of 5 months to 17.5 years. Type 1 VWD was diagnosed in 21 subjects, while 4 subjects had Type 2A VWD, 
6 had Type 2B VWD, 4 had Type 2M VWD, 1 had Type 2N VWD, and 7 subjects had Type 3 VWD. 
The  mean  daily  dose  was  51  IU  FVIII/kg  (range:  13-151  IU  FVIII/kg)  for  major  surgery  with  a  median 
treatment duration of 7 days (range: 1-24 days) and 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 14-76 IU FVIII/kg) for minor 
surgery with a median treatment duration of 3 days (range: 1-8 days). For NSB events, the mean daily dose 
was 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 16-192 IU FVIII/kg) with a median treatment duration of 1 day (range: 1-13 
days). 
Forty-two surgical events were treated: 10 major events in 10 subjects and 32 minor surgical events in 21 
subjects.  Four  episodes  of  post-surgical  bleeding  events  were  also  treated  in  4  subjects,  who  had  not 
received human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex to prevent bleeding during the procedure. A total of 72 NSB 
events were treated: 46 mucocutaneous in 11 subjects and 26 musculoskeletal or soft tissue bleedings in 13 
subjects. Only tranexamic acid was used as an adjunctive therapy in these subjects. 
The haemostatic efficacy for all surgical events was excellent or good in approximately 90% of events (90% 
major and 91% of minor surgical events). Haemostatic efficacy for all NSB events was rated as excellent or 
good in 94% of events, and within Type 3 VWD subjects in 98% of NSB events. 
The blood loss during surgical events was assessed by the surgeon for 15 minor and 5 major surgical events 
and in all cases was considered to be less than or equivalent to that normally expected in subjects without 
a bleeding disorder.  
Two subjects with Type 3 VWD received long term prophylaxis with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
to prevent bleeding. One subject had started prophylaxis therapy at 9 months of age which was successful 
at preventing recurrent epistaxis. However, a second subject suffered ongoing ankle joint bleeding, and was 
reported as having a low responding inhibitor, after 4 years of prophylaxis. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The general design, endpoints and sample size of both studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (Routine prophylaxis in 
subjects ≥ 12 years old) and CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (efficacy and safety in paediatric patients < 12 years old) are 
in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Human  Plasma  Derived  von  Willebrand  Factor 
Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 47/68 
 
  
  
 
All patients who received routine prophylaxis in Arm 3 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 were > 18 years old, thus 
the study did not contribute data on routine prophylaxis in adolescents. Notably, 6 of the 8 subjects in Arm 
3 had Type 3 VWD, a severe disease type with negligible levels of VWF thus comprising patients most likely 
to need or to benefit from routine prophylaxis. 
In study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, 10 of the 17 subjects had Type 3 VWD, which can be considered a relatively 
large number of children to include with this rare disease. 
The dosage ranges proposed in the schedule to be followed during both studies are somewhat lower than 
that of 40 to 80 IU/kg vWF:RCo and 20 to 40 IU/kg FVIII:C recommended in the Guideline on the Core SmPC 
for Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor, for achieving haemostasis. 
The target FVIII/vWF levels are close to that recommended (> 60% vWF:RiCo and > 40% FVIII:C) in the 
Core SmPC which proposes only a very global target level, and not specified for example for haemostasis in 
bleeds or in major or minor surgery. However, the Core SmPC gives no dosage recommendation for routine 
prophylaxis and no specific dosage recommendations for the paediatric population but states that where 
indicated in children information should be provided on whether dose and frequency of administration differs 
to that in adults.  
Overall, the dosage guideline used in both studies can be considered acceptable for the purposes of study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54 but in view of the doses used in the paediatric study of Howman et al (2010), it might be 
considered to be somewhat low for paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy in preventing bleeds during routine Prophylaxis 
Patients ≥12 years 
Routine  prophylaxis  in  adult  subjects  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  was  clearly  shown  to  be  efficacious  in 
preventing spontaneous bleeding events as the mean (2.0, s.d 2.2) and median (1.0, range 1 to 6) number 
of bleeding events over 12 months was much lower in the 8 subjects who continued on to receive routine 
prophylaxis in Arm 3 compared to the mean of 26.7 (SD 24.2) and median of 19.5, range 2 to 82 in the 20 
subjects on on-demand treatment in Arm 2. 
Importantly, during prophylaxis, there were 3 major bleeds in 2 subjects and 1 subject experienced 2 joint 
bleeds.  In  comparison,  in  the  same  8  subjects  during  on-demand  treatment,  5  subjects  experienced  a 
median of 7.0 major bleeds (range 2 to 59) and 3 subjects experienced a median of 34 joint bleeds (range 
7 to 58). 
Furthermore, efficacy in the treatment of all the 10 reported bleeds in subjects on prophylaxis was reported 
as excellent. Thus routine prophylaxis was successful in these subjects. 
No data on routine prophylaxis was obtained in adolescents, which is not considered to be of concern. 
Paediatric patients <12 years 
In  the  4  paediatric  patients  (age  <  12  years)  on  routine  prophylaxis,  the  efficacy  of  the  prophylaxis  in 
preventing bleeds was apparently less than in the 12 months prior to study entry. As suggested by the MAH 
in  the  CSR  of  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52,  this  difference  in  the  number  of  bleeds  might  be  attributable  to 
underreporting during the prior non-study period of 12 months compared to the stringent reporting during 
the study period because of the use of a diary and intensive follow-up by the investigator. 
The median number of major bleeds per subject in the prophylaxis arm was half that in the on-demand arm 
and the median number of joint bleeds was similar. However it is difficult to draw conclusions with such small 
numbers and the populations in the 2 arms were not similar. In prophylaxis Arm 1, three of the 4 subjects 
had the most severe type of VWD, Type 3 and one  subject had Type 2A whereas in on-demand Arm 2, 
approximately half of the subjects had Type 3 VWD (7/13) and the other 6 had Type 2A. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 48/68 
 
  
  
 
The  number  of  bleeds  per  subject  was  higher  in  the  on-demand  arm  compared  to  the  prophylaxis  arm. 
However the number of subjects was much smaller in the prophylaxis arm and there was no comparison 
between on-demand treatment and prophylaxis in the same subjects, which hampers interpretation of the 
numbers of bleeds. It is of some significance that approximately 97% of all bleeds in the prophylaxis arm 
were rated as minor compared to 73% in the on-demand arm. 
It is also of note that for 2 of the subjects on prophylaxis during study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, no treatment was 
required for approximately one third of their minor bleeds and for one subject 9% of the minor bleeds did not 
need  treatment.  Overall,  a  higher  percentage  of  bleeds  did  not  require  treatment  within  patients  on 
prophylaxis compared to patients receiving only on-demand treatment (16.7% of bleeds).  
Efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events 
The paediatric data in children < 12 years from study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 show a high level of haemostatic 
efficacy (efficacy reported as excellent in approximately 80% of bleeds) in the treatment of spontaneous and 
traumatic  bleeding  events  in  the  4  subjects  on  prophylaxis.  However,  the  level  of  haemostatic  efficacy 
reported  was  lower  in  the  12  subjects  receiving  only  on-demand  treatment  with  efficacy  reported  as 
excellent in only 45% of bleeds. 
Although a clinically relevant degree of haemostatic efficacy was reached in the on-demand treatment of 
bleeds in the paediatric subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, overall it was at a lower level than in the adult 
and  adolescent  subjects  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54.  Haemostatic  efficacy  was  rated  as  excellent  in 
approximately half of the bleeds and good in the rest compared to 90% excellent in the adult and adolescent 
subjects. 
It is reassuring that efficacy was rated as excellent for the majority (9 of 13) of the major mucosal bleeds 
during on-demand treatment in the paediatric patients as these are known to be difficult to treat. On the 
other hand, in the case of joint bleeds haemostatic efficacy was rated as good for 9 of 11 bleeds and for 2 
bleeds it was rated as excellent. 
Dosing 
Prophylactic dose in patients ≥12 years 
In study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, the mean (±s.d.) average dose per infusion given for prophylaxis was 28.8 (± 
4.1) and the median average dose was 28.1 (range 25 to 35) IU VWF:RCo/kg, according to protocol  to be 
given one to 3 times weekly. These doses were effective in reducing the number of bleeds and in reducing 
the number of major bleeds in the 8 subjects who first were treated on-demand in Arm2 and then received 
a prophylactic regimen in Arm 3. The median number of infusions per month in Arm 3 varied between 4.0 
and 7.0. These doses and dose frequencies are considered to support the prophylactic regimen of 25 – 40 
IU/kg VWF:RCo/kg 1 to 3 times per week recommended by the MAH in patients ≥12 years. This is included 
in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Dosing in paediatric patients <12 years 
Dose for the treatment of bleeds  
According to the protocol of paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the initial dose for the treatment of bleeds 
was to be  25 - 50 IU/kg VWF:RiCo with the aim of reaching a target VWF peak level of >50% (FVIII level 
>30%). It seems possible that this dosage range recommended in the protocol may not have been optimal 
for all patients <12 years. 
In the on-demand arm (n=12) of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in patients <12 years, the mean of the doses per 
patient actually used for the treatment of bleeding ranged from approximately 35 to 70 IU/kg VWF:RCo and 
the median of the doses per patient ranged from approximately 30 to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo.  Over all the 12 
subjects, the average dose (± s.d.) was 47.6 (± 16.8) IU/kg VWF:RCo and the median dose was 40.8 (range 
30.2 to 88.6) IU/kg VWF:RCo (Table 8 of the Applicant’s response to this question). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 49/68 
 
  
  
For  comparison,  in  pivotal  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  in  patients  aged  ≥12  years,  the  20  subjects  in  the 
on-demand arm (Arm 2) received a mean (± s.d.) average dose per infusion of 37.8 (± 8.7) IU/kg VWF:RCo 
and the median average dose per infusion was 36.1 IU/kg (range: 29 to 64) IU/kg VWF:RCo (Table 19 of this 
report: Summary of efficacy for Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54). 
Thus for children <12 years the mean and median doses per infusion used for the treatment of bleeds were 
higher than in patients ≥12 years. The doses used by children <12 years fell within the proposed on-demand 
dosing range of 40 - 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo but reached a higher level within this range than the doses used in 
patients ≥12 years. (See also discussion on Clinical pharmacology). 
Therefore the dosing regimen for the treatment of bleeding in the Paediatric VWD population was agreed as:  
“Usually 40 - 80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of body 
weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed. “ in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Prophylactic dose in patients <12 years 
Further analysis in the MAH response to the RfSI reveals that in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the 
median average dose per infusion during the period on prophylaxis was 62.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg. There was a 
large total number of infusions in Arm 1, including infusions given for prophylaxis and for the treatment of 
bleeding  events.  The  MAH  has  confirmed  that  the  mean  and  median  prophylactic  doses  used  in  these 
children were approximately 60 IU/kg and that the frequency of administration ranged from 1 to 3 times a 
week. 
At a single patient level, in the 3 subjects who had been on a prophylactic regimen prior to entry to study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the number of bleeding events per individual during the 12 months on  was rather similar 
in 2 subjects (from 28 to 34 in subject 110101 and from 19 to 14 in subject 110102) and higher in one 
subject (from 9 to 35 in subject 110103) than in the 12 months prior to study entry.  
The prophylactic doses used per individual were similar in the subjects on prophylaxis before and during the 
study and were also used by these patients in the continuation Study CSLCT-BIO-06-94. As discussed in the 
clinical pharmacology section, the dosing recommendation in section 4.2 of the SmPC for prophylaxis for 
patients aged <12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 years 
of age were shown to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 – 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2). 
The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their VWF:RCo 
and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The data from Study CSLCT-Bio-08-54 support an indication in routine prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous 
and traumatic bleeding events in the adult population with a recommended prophylactic dose of 25 - 50 
IU/kg VWF:RCo 1 to 3 times per week.  
The data from Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 support use in paediatric patients <12 years old. For the treatment 
of bleeds, it is agreed that the dose range of 40 - 80 IU/kg VWF:RiCo, the same as for patients ≥12 years, 
can be considered appropriate. Efficacy in routine prophylaxis has also been shown in 4 patients <12 years 
old with severe VWD.  
The protocol of the Post-Marketing Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, which was agreed as part of the post 
authorisation measures in the initial approval of Voncento, was amended to incorporate the dose range 
40-80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight for prophylaxis treatment in children.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  safety  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  has  been  established  in  clinical  studies  for  the 
treatment of both haemophilia A and VWD, and is supported by post-marketing surveillance data. 
Key  issues  with  regard  to  safety  of  FVIII  concentrates  are  inhibitor  development,  the  potential  for  viral 
contamination,  and  in  patients  with  VWD  the  risk  of  VTE  due  to  elevated  FVIII  levels.  As  with  any 
intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible and symptoms indicative of 
such  reactions  are  an  identified  risk  for  Human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex.  Whereas  inhibitor 
development is no less a concern than in previous decades, the problems of virus contamination in plasma 
derived products have been largely resolved  with successive improvements in the manufacturing process 
required by regulatory guidelines. Episodes of venous VTE have been reported in the literature in subjects 
with  VWD  receiving  VWF/FVIII  replacement  therapy,  especially  in  the  setting  of  known  risk  factors  for 
thrombosis (Mannucci PM et al, 2002; Makris M et al, 2002).  
Nevertheless, the number of such events in the literature has remained very low.

Patient exposure 
In  the  prospective  clinical  studies,  74  subjects  with  VWD,  including  3  adolescent  subjects  (all  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54) and 18 paediatrics below 12 years of age (17 subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and 1 
in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97) were exposed to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as shown in Table 28. 
Investigator-led studies included 43 adult VWD subjects (Shortt study) and 43 paediatric subjects (Howman 
study).

* In general this refers to 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent exposure. 
**The retrospective Howman study (Haemophilia 2011) included 43 paediatric patients aged 0.4 to 17 years but apart 
from 2 paediatric subjects on routine prophylaxis, results were for the most part not reported according to age subgroups. 
Adults 
Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54: 
All subjects completed at least 12 months of treatment. 
On-demand treatment: Subjects in the on-demand arm (Arm 2) had a median number of 20.0 infusions 
(range: 3-92) over 12 months at a median IMP dose of 36.1 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 29 64 IU/kg). 
Prophylaxis treatment: All subjects received prophylaxis therapy for 12 months with a median number of 
72.5 infusions (range: 16-118), with the exception of the single subject in Arm 1 who received 197 infusions 
over  15  months  and  1  subject  in  Arm  3  who  withdrew  consent  after  about  10.5  months  of  prophylaxis 
treatment.

All 17 paediatric subjects completed the 12 month treatment period of the study. 
Prophylaxis treatment: The 4 subjects of the prophylaxis treatment arm (Arm 1) of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, 
received a median number of 137.5 infusions. In Arm 1, a median number of 119 infusions (range: 45-161) 
were administered as prophylaxis, and a median of 17 (8-41) to treat a bleeding event. 
On-demand  treatment:  The  13  subjects  in  the  on-demand  arm  (Arm  2),  had  a  median  number  of  8.0 
infusions  (range  1-53)  at  a  median  dose  of  50.9  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  per  infusion  (range:  35.4-115.1  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg). 
The 3-year-old boy in VWD study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 received 66 infusions of 500 IU FVIII each (about 29 IU 
FVIII/kg  body  weight  (Assessor:  corresponding  approximately  to  60  IU  VWF:RCo/kg))  as  prophylaxis 
treatment. 
Supportive retrospective investigator-led studies in VWD  
Shortt  study  (2007,  principally  surgery  and  1  child  on  prophylaxis):  The  average  daily  dose  of  human 
coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  was  29  IU  FVIII/kg  (range:  9-65  IU  FVIII/kg).  The  mean  duration  of 
treatment for each event was 4 days (range 1-13 days). 
Howman study paediatric study (principally surgery and 2 subjects on prophylaxis): The median duration of 
treatment for major surgeries was 7 days (range: 1-24 days) at a mean daily dose of 51 IU FVIII/kg (range: 
13-151 IU FVIII/kg). Minor surgeries were treated for a median duration of 3 days (range: 1-8 days) at a 
mean dose of 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 14 76 IU FVIII/kg). For NSB events, the median duration was 1 day 
(range: 1 13 days) and the mean dose 45 IU FVIII/kg (range: 16-192 IU FVIII/kg). 
Long term exposure 
With regard to long term exposure, in the prospective clinical studies, it seems that 39 VWD patients ≥12 
years  (Assessor’s  calculation),  and  13  paediatric  patients  under  12  years  have  been  exposed  to  human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex for up to 12 months, intermittently at varying frequencies for the treatment 
of non-surgical and surgical bleeding events.  
Eight adults who continued from on-demand treatment in Arm 2 of study CSTCT-BIO-08-54 on to routine 
prophylaxis in Arm 3 of that study receiving doses 1 to 3 times weekly and reached an exposure of (in one 
case almost) 24 months. 
Overall the exposure in 10 adults (studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and CSLT-BIO-03-97) and 5 subjects < 12 
years (studies CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and CSLT-BIO-03-97) during long term routine prophylaxis is considered 
adequate to assess the safety of the treatment regimen which only a subset of subjects with severe VWD are 
likely to need. 
Also, the exposure overall in 18 paediatric subjects < 12 years is considered adequate for assessing the 
safety and it can be taken into consideration that a post-marketing study will follow. 
Adverse events  
Adults and paediatric patients 
A  total  of  508  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs,  ie,  with  onset  after  first  dose  of  study 
medication) were reported during the clinical studies, 210 in haemophilia A studies (143 in pivotal study 
CSLCT-BIO-07-47, 2 and 65 in supportive studies CSLCT-BIO-95-30 and CSLCT-BIO-95-41, respectively) 
and 298 in VWD studies (86 and 77 in pivotal studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and CSLCT-BIO-08-52, respectively, 
and 24 and 111 in supportive studies CSLCT-BIO-00-75 and CSLCT-BIO-03-97, respectively). An overview 
of the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 TEAE during the prospective clinical studies is provided by 
AE type and study in Table 29.

Serious adverse events 
Adults and paediatric patients 
A total of 9 subjects experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) during the clinical studies, 5 subjects with 
haemophilia A and 4 subjects with VWD.  
None of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  or  to  study  procedures  which  can  be  agreed  based  on  the  data 
submitted. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred during or shortly after any of the clinical studies in either the haemophilia A or VWD 
subject populations. 
Significant adverse events 
- No positive FVIII or VWF inhibitor titres occurred during any of the prospective clinical studies. 
Please see “Immunological Events” below. 
- No VTE (venous thromboembolism) events were reported in any of the studies.  
- No indication of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex causing allergic or anaphylactic reactions was seen 
in clinical studies.  
-  During  the  studies  that  provided  safety  data,  no  cases  of  suspected  transmission  of  hepatitis  virus  or 
parvovirus B19 occurred. 
The  population  studied  is  very  small  with  regard  to  the  likelihood  of  detecting  uncommon  events. 
Nevertheless it can be concluded that the adverse event profile is very benign. 
No safety concern specific to the paediatric population has been identified. 
Overdose 
It is noted that 3 subjects in the PK part of paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 received doses which were a 
factor  2  too  high.  This  also  occurred  in  one  case  in  pivotal  VWD  study  CSLCT  BIO  08  54  in  adults  and 
adolescents. These reports were not associated with any TEAEs. 
These were apparently due to incorrect dosing because of confusion arising from the labelling both in units 
of FVIII and in units of VWF (the number of units of FVIII in the product is half that of VWF). The subjects 
were dosed according to the labelled FVIII:C content and not the VWF:RCo content. 
This remains a point of concern and will be retained in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Adults and paediatric patients 
Overall,  there  were  no  consistent  changes  in  mean  haematology  or  clinical  chemistry  values  across  the 
studies, and no trends were observed in changes in individual haematology or clinical chemistry values. Also, 
no consistent statistically or clinically significant changes from pre-dose values were noted in vital signs in 
any of the clinical studies. 
Safety in special populations 
No apparent differences between the safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in adolescents (n=8: 
5 subjects with haemophilia A and 3 with VWD) and that in adults were seen. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 56/68 
 
  
  
Pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 assessed the safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in paediatric 
subjects  <12  years  of  age.  Apart  from  a  slightly  different  AE  reporting  profile,  no  clinically  relevant 
differences were seen in safety findings between children and adults, which is supported by the available 
clinical experience in other studies (including the Howman study) and post-marketing information. 
The safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in the geriatric population has not been systematically 
studied. However, subjects in the clinical trials have included individuals up to 85 years. Updated information 
on the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) experienced by elderly patients (≥ 65 years) is tabulated for clinical 
studies (CT) and post-marketing data (PM) has been supplied by the MAH in the response to the RfSI (Table 
30). 
Table 30. Number of ADRs reported by patients (PM) or subjects (CT), by age group 
•  No new ADRs were reported in Arm 3 of CSLCT-BIO-08-54, 
•  2 AEs which were ‘possibly related’ were reported for paediatric subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 
(erythema at infusion site and pyrexia, both non-serious, both resolved within 1 day; both General 
disorders and administration site conditions ) 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 57/68 
 
  
  
 
•  No ADRs were reported in the extension study CSLCT-BIO-09-64; Subject 08-54-05001 aged 68 
continued into the extension study, but reported no ADRs; no other adults in this study were ≥65 
years of age. 
In addition, in study CSLCT-BIO-10-67 (study terminated early) in haemophilia A (treatment for immune 
tolerance induction (ITI therapy)) 3 ADR were reported: hydrocephalus (Nervous system disorders, SAE), 
ischemic stroke (nervous system disorder, SAE), stenosis of the a carotis (Nervous system disorder, SAE). 
The adverse events described in the single child in the terminated ITI study CSLCT-BIO-10-67 have been 
evaluated in a previous procedure (EMEA/H/C/002493/0000/P46). It was concluded that the patient had 
underlying pathology and that the B/R remained positive. 
In patients aged 65 to 74 years, there were 13 ADRs of which three were serious, but no information is given 
on the nature of these adverse events.  
Immunological Events 
Inhibitors 
No  positive  FVIII  or  VWF  inhibitor  titres  occurred  during  any  of  the  prospective  clinical  studies,  with  1 
exception:  a  positive  FVIII  inhibitor  finding  was  reported  for  1  subject  at  the  final  visit  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-07-47; this case was also reported as an SAE (aggravation of pre-existing FVIII inhibitors) that 
led  to  study  discontinuation.  In  supportive  VWD  study  CSLCT-BIO-03-97,  concerns  were  raised  about  a 
suspected  inhibitor  in  1  subject  who  had  very  low  (zero)  levels  of  VWF:RCo  for  2  NSB  events  although 
adequate doses of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex had been administered. However, VWF inhibitors 
were not measured in this study. In the retrospective investigator-led Howman study (Howman et al, 2011), 
1 subject with Type 3 VWD was reported to have a low responding inhibitor that was noted after 4 years of 
prophylaxis treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. 
Allergic/Anaphylactic Reactions 
During the clinical studies that provided safety data, no indication for human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
causing allergic or anaphylactic reactions was seen. 
No allergic/anaphylactic reactions were observed in clinical studies but it is noted that In Table 6 of the 
Summary of Clinical safety a single case of upper airway obstruction is listed which occurred in one patient. 
In the context of other reported TEAEs it was considered not to represent a hypersensitivity reaction. The 
MAH has provided a narrative of this case explaining that the reported event was nasal obstruction with no 
elements suggestive of lower airway obstruction and that the event does not appear to have been due to a 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interactions between human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and other medicinal products are known. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the studies supporting the current extension of indication of prophylaxis in VWD, and to include paediatric 
data in the SmPC, no discontinuations due to adverse events were reported. 
Notably there were no discontinuations for any reason from the paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52.

Post marketing experience 
Voncento (human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex), is centrally authorised in the EU since 12 August 2013. 
Post-marketing  surveillance  data  collected  by  CSL  comprise  AE  information  collected  in  the  company’s 
database  since  first  registration  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  (Australia,  August  2000). 
Post-marketing data were collected from a variety of sources including spontaneous reports (both consumer 
and health care professional), investigator-led studies (Shortt et al, 2007; Howman et al, 2011) and data 
from the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee database.  
Since  launch  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  and  up  to  February  2014,  701,467,500  IU  were 
distributed  globally,  and  based  on  calculation  from  a  single  standard  dose  this  total  amount  of  human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex was administered (globally) in 350,734 single dose exposures, resulting in 
a total exposure of 2,248 patient years. 
Since  August  2000  up  to  12  February  2014,  111  spontaneous  ADRs  from  39  case  reports  for  human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex were reported by spontaneous data sources. The most frequently reported 
preferred terms were drug ineffectiveness (12), malaise (7), dizziness (6), nausea (5), and ecchymosis (5). 
Of the 111 ADRs, 38 were serious. No changes to the reference safety information were deemed necessary 
from the evaluation of these events. The cumulative experience to date of human coagulation FVIII/VWF 
complex is shown in Figure 3 below.

No viral infections were reported in the studies supporting this application.  
Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions 
Cumulatively, to date, there have been 12 reports of hypersensitivity and 1 report of anaphylactic reaction 
following the administration of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.  
Inhibitor formation 
Two cases of inhibitor formation (one in a subject with VWD and one in a subject with haemophilia A) to 
human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex were reported to CSL in 10 years of post-marketing surveillance.   
Thromboembolic events 
To  date,  there  have  been  no  post-marketing  spontaneous  reports  of  thromboembolic  type  events  after 
treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
In the prospective pivotal clinical studies, close to 40 VWD patients ≥12 years and 13 patients < 12 years 
have been exposed to Voncento for up to 12 months, intermittently at varying frequencies for the treatment 
of non-surgical and surgical bleeding events.  
In  the  pivotal  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  eight  adults  received  an  additional  12 
months treatment (in one case 10.5 months) on a routine prophylaxis regimen reaching an exposure of 24 
months and 4 additional paediatric patients <12years old were also treated for 12 months with a routine 
prophylaxis regimen. Altogether there were 9 subjects with Type 3 VWD of whom 6 were adults and 3 were 
children <12 years old with 2 <6 years old. 
Although the numbers are not high, in view of the fact that only a subset of subjects with severe VWD are 
likely to need prophylaxis,  overall the exposure in 10 adults and 5 subjects < 12 years in the prospective 
studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54, CSLCT-BIO-08-52 and CSLT-BIO-03-97 during long term routine prophylaxis is 
considered adequate to assess the safety of the treatment regimen. 
Also, the exposure overall in 18 paediatric subjects < 12 years is considered sufficient to evaluate safety in 
that age group. 
Three subjects aged from 12 to 18 years have been treated in the clinical studies but no subjects in this age 
range have been treated with a routine prophylaxis regimen. Given that there are data in children < 12 years 
and subjects from 19 years upwards, this is not considered to be a serious deficit. 
Adverse Events 
In  the  context  of  this  procedure  concerning  patients  with  VWD,  important  potential  risks  are  inhibitor 
development and the risk of VTE due to elevated FVIII levels. Also, as with any intravenous protein product, 
allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible particularly with repeated exposure. In plasma derived 
products there is also the potential for viral contamination. 
During  the  studies  that  provided  safety  data,  no  cases  of  suspected  transmission  of  hepatitis  virus  or 
parvovirus B19 occurred. No VTE (venous thromboembolism) events were reported in any of the studies. 
There has been only one report of development of inhibitor to VWD which concerned a Type 3 VWD in the 
retrospective  investigator  led  Howman  study.  The  patient  had  developed  a  low  responding  inhibiting 
antibody to VWF after 4 years on a prophylactic regimen. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

Page 60/68 
 
  
  
The  MAH  reports  that  no  indication  of  human  coagulation  FVIII/VWF  complex  causing  allergic  or 
anaphylactic reactions was seen in clinical studies. However, as no narrative can be found, the MAH is asked 
to clarify the conclusion that, in the context of other reported TEAEs, a case of upper airway obstruction was 
considered not to represent a hypersensitivity reaction. 
The data in the clinical studies submitted on the treatment of VWD did not reveal a particular pattern of AEs 
and  the  AEs  reported  most  frequently  post-marketing  are  to  be  expected  due  to  the  intravenous 
administration, to the bleeding disorder being treated or were non-specific. 
Overall the adverse events reported in patients of all ages were mild and none led to discontinuation. There 
were no deaths during the clinical studies. Serious adverse events were reported during the clinical studies 
in 4 patients with VWD and none were considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. The incidence and type of laboratory AEs do not raise 
concern and are not considered influencing the safety. 
However,  the  numbers  of  patients  with  VWD  in  the  clinical  trials  are  small  with  regard  to  detecting 
uncommon adverse events and the safety profile in both VWD will be further evaluated in post-marketing 
study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and will be followed in the PSURs. 
There are few data in patients older than 65 years with VWD with one patient in this age range in the pivotal 
study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 who also received routine prophylaxis. Lack of data in this age range is included as 
missing information in the RMP. 
The possibility of incorrect dosing due to product labelling in units of FVIII and VWF remained a real issue in 
the VWD studies submitted and should continue to be covered in the RMP. In the packaging and product 
information the MAH emphasises the dual content and different amounts of FVIII and VWF in the product in 
order to reduce the chance of dosage errors. 
The favourable AE profile of Voncento as known in the post-marketing history is acknowledged, although it 
is considered that underreporting cannot be excluded. 
The AEs reported most frequently post-marketing e.g. administration site 
conditions, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders, vascular disorders and nervous system disorders 
are to be expected due to the intravenous administration , to the bleeding 
disorder being treated or are non-specific.

Conclusions on clinical safety 
From the data submitted, no unexpected adverse events or pattern of adverse events has emerged and the 
AEs reported were generally mild and not serious. No new safety concerns have arisen and the safety profile 
is considered to remain positive. 
In particular, no significant issues of safety or ADRs were identified during treatment of a limited number 
(18) of paediatric patients ranging in age from <1 year to 11 years, including prophylaxis in 4 patients of 
whom 3 were <6 years. 
Overall no safety concerns have arisen during routine prophylaxis regimens given to patients with severe 
VWD for a period of 12 months. The additional cases of overdose reported from clinical trials were included 
in  section  4.9  but  no  adverse  reactions  have  been  associated  with  these  reports  (see  SmPC).  Risk  of 
incorrect dosing was included in the RMP (See also RMP). 
2.5.2.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 18 August 2015.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.0 is acceptable. In addition, minor revisions 
were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update. 
The clinical data provided in support of the variation application (CSLCT-BIO-08-52, CSLCT-BIO-08-54) 
showed that the safety profile of Voncento in paediatric patients was comparable to the established safety 
profile of the product; no new or unexpected risks were identified. The important potential risk ‘Off-label use 
including in ITI therapy and children under 12 years’ was narrowed to ‘Off-label use including in ITI therapy’.   
The proposal to remove the safety concerns ‘Mild forms of haemophillia A’ and ‘Patients with AIDS and other 
chronic illnesses’ from the missing information was supported as no specific safety concerns have been 
identified and neither foreseen with regard to use of Voncento in these populations. 
The safety concern ‘Immune Tolerance Induction Therapy’ classified as missing information should be 
followed as important potential risk. Data on ITI in haemophilia A patients using a VIII product with a high 
VWF content would be of interest as there are few data on ITI with such a product. 
The proposal to remove the safety concern ‘Exposure date in non-Caucasian ethnic groups’ was approvable 
as the MAH is requested to provide within the next PSUR (DLP: 12 August 2015), a detailed review of the 
current available data on the differences in inhibitor development between ethnic populations, and discuss 
the need to update the product information. Also, the MAH is requested to discuss the need for a RMP 
update, on the basis of the results of the data review. 
Removing of missing information ‘Paediatric data (< 12 years)’ from the safety specification was approvable 
in view of the submitted data on use of Voncento in the paediatric VWD indication. The subsequently 
included mising information ‘Off-label use in paediatric haemophilia A patients’ should be changed to ‘Use in 
paediatric haemophilia A patients’. The MAH commited to adapt the RMP accordingly in the upcoming 
variation. 
No new pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed in this RMP update.

Finally, no changes to the risk minimisation measures have been proposed in this update. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, Annex II has been updated to amend the address of the manufacturing sites and the Labelling 
was updated with some editorial changes. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Routine prophylaxis treatment 
Adults and adolescents: The median number of bleeding events during 12 months of routine prophylaxis in 
Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 was reduced to 1.0 (range 1 to 6) compared to a median of 26.5 (range 18 to 82) 
in these patients during the previous 12 months. During prophylaxis in the adults, there were 3 major bleeds 
in 2 subjects and 1 subject experienced 2 joint bleeds, compared to 8 subjects during on-demand treatment, 
5 subjects experienced a median of 7.0 major bleeds (range 2 to 59) and 3 subjects experienced a median 
of 34 joint bleeds (range 7 to 58). The single subject in Arm 1 of Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 experienced 10 
bleeds during 15 months of routine prophylaxis. 
Concerning the on-demand treatment of bleeding events in the 12 paediatric patients <12 years of age in 
arm 2 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, haemostatic efficacy assessment of excellent or good as reported in about 
half the bleeds overall may be clinically acceptable but a higher rate of higher efficacy than reported in study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52  might  be  clinically  desirable.  In  this  regard  it  is  of  importance  that  in  these  children 
haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent in 9 of 13 major mucosal bleeds which are known to be difficult 
to treat 
Children <12years:  
Out of 4 paediatric subjects <12 years old, 3 of whom had Type 3 VWD, in study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 , in 2 of 
the 3 subjects on prophylaxis both prior to and during study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 the number of major bleeds 
was reduced compared to their previous prophylactic regimen and in one of these it remained the same. The 
single  subject  who  had  been  on-demand  treatment  before  going  on  to  prophylaxis  in  study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-52 had one major bleed on prophylaxis compared to 2 in the prior 12 months of on-demand 
treatment. 
Haemostatic  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  bleeds  occurring  while  on  prophylaxis  was  reported  as  being 
excellent in all except one bleed in adults (a major mucosal bleed with efficacy rating of good in the single 
subject in Arm 1) and in the majority of bleeds in children < 12 years (efficacy rating of excellent in 80.8% 
of 73 bleeds and good in the rest). 
Haemostatic efficacy in on-demand treatment 
Adults and adolescents:  
In  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  the  investigator  assessed  haemostatic  efficacy  assessment  in  407  events  as 
excellent in 92.1%, good in 6.1% and moderate in 1.7%. 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015 
Page 63/68 
 
  
  
Major bleeding events: For the 125 major bleeds, the distribution of investigator efficacy ratings was very 
similar. Overall, the haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event was assessed as excellent for 480/606 
(79.1%) days, good for 104/606 (17.2%) and moderate for 21/606 (3.5%).  
Children <12years:  
In paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 haemostatic efficacy assessment by the investigator in 80 events in 12 
subjects was excellent in 45.0% and good in 55.0%. 
Major bleeding events: For 26 major bleeds the distribution of investigator efficacy ratings was similar to 
that overall.  
Overall, the subjects assessed haemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event as excellent for 60/76 bleeding 
days (78.9%) and as good for the remaining 16 bleeding days (21.1%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  children  on  routine  prophylaxis  experienced  many  more  bleeds  (median  23.5)  during  the  12  month 
period than the adults (median 1.0) on routine prophylaxis. Similarly, the investigator rated haemostatic 
efficacy  as  excellent  in  the  treatment  of  bleeding  events  during  the  on-demand  treatment  periods  less 
frequently  in  the  paediatric  <12  years  of  age  (45%)  than  in  the  adult  patients  (92.1%)  although  the 
subjects’ assessment per day of bleeding event was similar. 
Factors which may explain the lower efficacy observed in the paediatric subjects 12 years old have not been 
fully explored. Ongoing post authorisation studies agreed with the MAA may provide more information. 
No  subjects  aged  from  12  to  18  years  have  been  treated  with  a  routine  prophylaxis  regimen,  however 
pharmacokinetics in adolescents is similar to that of the adult population. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Across the clinical studies in VWD, the percentage of subjects who experienced any treatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) ranged from approximately 68% to 96%, however, the percentage of subjects who 
experienced a possibly related TEAE ranged from approximately 9% to 17%. 
Overall the adverse events reported in the clinical studies were mild and none led to discontinuation.  
There has been one report of development of a low responding inhibiting antibody to VWF which occurred in 
a paediatric subject with Type 3 VWD after 4 years on long term prophylaxis. Otherwise there have been no 
reports of inhibitor development either in the clinical studies or post-marketing. 
Post-marketing, including previous generations of this human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex, there have 
been 12 reports of hypersensitivity and 1 report of anaphylactic reaction. 
Incorrect dosing due to product labelling in units of FVIII and VWF has occurred in 3 subjects in the PK part 
of paediatric study CSLCT-08-52 and the risk for dosing errors has been addressed in the RMP 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The number of patients with VWD in the clinical trials is small with regard to detecting uncommon adverse 
events such as the occurrence of inhibitor to VWD. Additional information is expected from post marketing 
surveillance in the PSURs.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A VWF concentrate is currently the only effective treatment to improve haemostasis in subjects with a severe 
VWD phenotype. 
The reduction in the number of bleeding events in a period of 12 months seen in the adult population, is 
clearly  of  value  in  terms  of  reduced  morbidity  and  risk  of  life  threatening  mucosal  bleeds,  especially 
gastrointestinal bleeds and also joint bleeds. Subjects with Type 3 VWD also have very low circulating levels 
of FVIII as VWF is a carrier for FVIII in plasma and are thus prone to joint bleeds similar to patients with 
haemophilia A. 
The aim of prophylaxis is to reduce the frequency of spontaneous and traumatic bleeds as far as possible. 
Current data on the 4 paediatric patients under 12 years of age who received routine prophylaxis, are limited 
by  the  small  number  and  heterogeneity  of  patients,  thus  the  magnitude  of  the  efficacy  in  reducing  the 
number  and  severity  of  bleeds  experienced  by  these  subjects  while  on  prophylaxis,  is  difficult  to  be 
unequivocally demonstrated.  
Concerning the on-demand treatment of bleeding events in the 12 paediatric patients <12 years of age in 
arm 2 of study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, haemostatic efficacy is clinically acceptable and it is of importance that in 
cases of haemostatic efficacy rated as excellent in 9 of 13 major mucosal bleeds which are known to be 
difficult  to  treat,  was  achieved.  Overall,  in  children  <12  years,  approximately  97%  of  all  bleeds  in  the 
prophylaxis arm were rated as minor compared to 73% in the on-demand arm 
Unfavourable  effects  in  terms  of  adverse  events  were  minimal  and  in  line  with  those  expected  with  a 
coagulation factor concentrate however, administration of the product up to 3 times weekly can be seen as 
a burden to the patient.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Concerning routine prophylaxis in adult patients, the benefit in terms of reduction in the number of bleeding 
events is considered to be unequivocally established. 
The  unfavourable  effects  of  treatment  with  the  human  coagulation  factor  VIII/VWF  in  terms  of  adverse 
events were few and most were not of clinical significance. Thus in these patients, the efficacy of routine 
prophylaxis can be considered to outweigh the mild adverse event profile and the burden of administrations 
up to 3 times weekly. 
In paediatric patients <12 years, it remains difficult to assess the value of the prophylactic regimen used in 
this small number of patients. However adverse events reported were generally mild.  
In general, any reduction in the number and severity of bleeds would have to be weighed in each individual 
against the burden of administration of the product up to 3 times weekly.  
In patients of all ages efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events was adequate and outweighs the mild 
adverse event profile.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events in paediatric patients outweighs unfavourable 
effects and data confirm that dosing based on weight is appropriate also in paediatric patients.  
Concerning routine prophylaxis in paediatric patients <12 years old, 3 of the 4 patients in whom prophylaxis 
was investigated were already on at least 12 months prophylaxis before entering the study and 3 of the 4 
had Type 3 VWD. Furthermore, none of them stopped the prophylaxis regimen during the study. There are 
few reports available in the literature concerning routine prophylaxis in VWD but it is advocated by some 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/492782/2015

experts at an early age in subjects with a phenotype of severe VWD (Abshire et al. Prophylaxis in severe 
forms of von Willebrand’s disease: results from the von Willebrand Disease Prophylaxis Network (VWD PN) 
Haemophilia  2013,  Lassila  et  al  Semin  Thromb  Haemost  2011)  in  order  to  prevent  joint  damage  and  to 
reduce  the  number  of  mucosal  bleeds  which  are  potentially  serious.  In  a  study  with  the  VWF/FVIII 
concentrate Wilate, 11 patients < 6 years with phenotypically severe VWD experienced 68 bleeding events 
over a 12 month period on routine prophylaxis (Nowak-Göttl et al. Haemophilia 2013).  
Thus  it  seems  justified  to  view  children  with  phenotypically  severe  VWD  as  a  population  in  need  of 
prophylaxis  and  not  to  exclude  paediatric  VWD  patients  <12  years  old  from  an  indication  in  routine 
prophylaxis. The data obtained from children <12 years on routine prophylaxis with Voncento are limited in 
that only 4 subjects received prophylaxis, although it is of value that 3 of these subjects were <6 years old 
during the study.  
Conclusion 
The benefit-risk balance for the modification of the indication to “Prophylaxis and treatment of haemorrhage 
or surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or 
contraindicated.” is considered positive. 
The initial MAA in Europe included the interim study report for study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 that presented the 
results up to the Month 12 visit. In this submission, the interim study report was replaced by the final study 
report  which  included  an  additional  12  months  of  prophylaxis  treatment  results,  completing  the  entire 
24-month treatment period of the study.  
Furthermore,  the  MAH  proposes  to  revise  the  paediatric  information  in  various  sections  of  the  SmPC, 
following the completion of Study CSL-CT-08-52 in children ≤12 years old with VWD.  
The benefit- risk balance for both the treatment of bleeding events and for routine prophylaxis in paediatric 
patients with VWD is also considered to be positive.  
The  dosage  proposed  in  the  paediatric  population,  in  particular  patients  <12  years  old  is  considered 
acceptable  provided  the  proposal  for  SmPC  posology  Section  4.2  is  modified  as  indicated  in  Section  4 
“Recommendations” of this report.

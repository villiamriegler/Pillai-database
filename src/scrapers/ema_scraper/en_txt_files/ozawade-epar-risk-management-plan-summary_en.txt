PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
OZAWADE® (PITOLISANT) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Ozawade®.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Ozawade®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Ozawade®’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ozawade®’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ozawade® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Ozawade® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Ozawade®’s RMP. 
I The medicine and what it is used for 
Ozawade® is indicated to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) 
in adult patients with obstructive  sleep  apnea (OSA) whose  EDS  has  not been  satisfactorily 
treated by, or who have not tolerated, OSA primary therapy, such as continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP). . 
It contains pitolisant as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ozawade®’s benefits can be found in Ozawade®’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ozawade.  
II  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Ozawade®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Ozawade®’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions  is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ozawade® is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Ozawade® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Ozawade®. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Identified risks

Potential risks 
Long term risks of body weight increase 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Weight  increase  has  been  reported  uncommonly  (in  up  to  40 
patients in 1,513 treated with pitolisant). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No  specific  risk  group  (age  or  gender)  was  identified  with 
pitolisant  during  the  clinical  development.  However  the 
prevalence of obesity is high in population with sleep disorders.

Cardiovascular events including QT-interval prolongation 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Pitolisant  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  underlying 
severe cardiovascular disease. 
Pitolisant  produces  QT  prolongation  at  doses  higher  than  the 
therapeutic dose. In clinical trials, no effects on the heart were 
identified  at  therapeutic  doses.  Patients  with  heart  disease, 
treated with other QT-prolonging medicines or known to be at 
risk of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), treated with medicines 
that increase the amount of pitolisant in the blood or with severe 
kidney  or  moderate  liver  impairment  should  be  carefully 
monitored. 
No  specific  risk  group  (age  or  gender)  was  identified  with 
pitolisant  during  the  clinical  development.  However  the 
prevalence of cardiovascular disease  is high in population with 
sleep disorders.

Adverse effects on reproductive function 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
No data on fertility are available in humans. Studies in animals 
have shown effect on semen parameters, without a significant 
impact on reproductive performance in males and reduction on 
the percentage of live fetuses in treated females.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patient with medical history of fertility disorders.

Adverse effects on embryofoetal development 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Pregnancy  
There are no data on the use of pitolisant in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, including 
teratogenicity  (causing  birth  defects).  Ozawade 
is  not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing 
potential  not  using  contraception.  Ozawade  may  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  hormonal  contraceptives; 
therefore  an 
alternative method of contraception should be used.  
Breastfeeding  
Animal studies have shown that pitolisant can pass into breast 
milk.  Therefore  breastfeeding 
is  contraindicated  during 
treatment with Ozawade.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Child bearing potential women without effective contraceptive 
method.

Category 3 study:  
P21-02:  A  multi-center,  observational  post-authorization  safety  study  to  compare  the 
cardiovascular  and  long-term  safety  of  OZAWADE  in  patients  with  obstructive  sleep 
apnoea  treated  or  not  by  CPAP  and  exposed  or  not  to  OZAWADE  according  to  the 
therapeutic indication in the SmPC, when used in routine medical practice. 
Purpose of the study: 
The primary objective of the PASS will assess the cardiovascular risk (Cardiovascular events 
including QT-interval prolongation) in OSA patients treated with OZAWADE compared with 
OZAWADE-unexposed  patients  with  OSA.  The  second  primary  objective  is  to  collect 
information on long-term safety of pitolisant in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea treated 
with OZAWADE according to the agreed therapeutic indication in the SmPC.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for rituximab, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on enteroviral meningoencephalitis from the literature and spontaneous 
reports, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship 
between rituximab and enteroviral meningoencephalitis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing rituximab should be amended 
accordingly. 
In view of available data on false negative serologic testing of infections from the literature and 
spontaneous reports and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between rituximab and false negative serologic testing is at least a reasonable possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing rituximab should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for rituximab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing rituximab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

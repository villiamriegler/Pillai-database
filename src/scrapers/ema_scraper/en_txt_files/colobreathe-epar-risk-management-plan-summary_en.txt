Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan  
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Colistimethate sodium 
(COLOBREATHE®) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Colistimethate sodium 
(Colobreathe®). The RMP details important risks of Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®), how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Colistimethate 
sodium (Colobreathe®)'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®)'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its 
package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®) should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®) should be read in the 
context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®)'s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for 
Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®) is authorised for control of persistent lung infections 
caused by bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients and children aged 6 years and 
older with cystic fibrosis (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains colistimethate as the 
active substance and it is given as inhalation powder.  
Further information about the evaluation of Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®)’s benefits can 
be found in Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®)’s EPAR, including in its plain-language 
summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®), together with measures to minimise 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Colistimethate sodium 
(Colobreathe®)’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®), these measures are supplemented with 
additional risk minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®) is 
not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Colistimethate sodium (Colobreathe®) are risks that need special risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product 
can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Colistimethate sodium 
(Colobreathe®). Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use 
of the medicine);

Important potential risk: Nephrotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Nephrotoxicity is the primary adverse effect that limits systemic use of the 
polymyxin class of antibiotics. 
There is no evidence of any nephrotoxicity in patients treated with Colobreathe®. 
The nephrotoxic potential of colistimethate sodium administered systemically 
seems to be dose related and reversible upon discontinuation, although complete 
recovery has been reported to take several weeks or longer. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
It is presumed that those with existing impaired renal function and using other 
potentially nephrotoxic drugs would be more susceptible to such a risk. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.4 and 4.5. 
PL section 2. 
Prescription only medicine. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None. 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance activities 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities: 
None. 
Important potential risk: Neurotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
There were no reports of neurotoxicity in clinical trials with Colobreathe®. 
Neurotoxicity has been associated with systemic use of colistimethate, normally 
at doses much higher than those employed in modern treatment regimens. 
Care should still be taken in administering Colobreathe® to patients who are 
known to have a propensity for neurotoxic events. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with pre-existing neurotoxic conditions.

Important potential risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
There were no reports of hepatotoxicity in clinical trials with Colobreathe®. 
There is no clear evidence of association with this risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
None known, although it is presumed that those with existing impaired liver 
function would be more susceptible to such a risk.

Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
There were no reports of increased sensitisation to colistimethate due to inhaled 
route of administration in clinical trials with Colobreathe®. 
There is no clear evidence of association with this risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
None known.

Important potential risk: Capsule fragmentation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Capsule fragmentation is a quality issue that may potentially have safety 
consequences. As of September 2017 hard gelatin capsule has been replaced with 
PEG capsule, which are standard gelatin capsules containing polyethylene glycol 
as an additional plasticizer. The addition of PEG renders the capsules less brittle 
compared to standard gelatin capsules, even at lower moisture content, which is 
advantageous for formulations that are hygroscopic and are manufactured under 
lower humidity conditions, as is the case with Colobreathe®. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk groups and no risk factors have been identified regarding this quality 
issue and possible safety consequences.

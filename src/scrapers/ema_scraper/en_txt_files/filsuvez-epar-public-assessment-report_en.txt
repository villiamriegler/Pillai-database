1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Amryt Pharmaceuticals DAC submitted on 8 March 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Filsuvez, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 March 2018. 
Filsuvez, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/845 on 23 February 2011 in the 
following condition: Treatment of epidermolysis bullosa. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Filsuvez as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/filsuvez. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment to achieve accelerated healing of wounds associated with dystrophic and junctional 
epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in patients from birth onwards. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0425/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0425/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

1.5.  Applicant’s request for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that the strength of the 
evidence generated with Filsuvez to support fulfilment of an unmet medical need in dystrophic and 
junctional EB was not deemed undoubtedly convincing. The efficacy was regarded as modest, no 
disease-modifying effect has been demonstrated, nor any effects on prevention of complications like 
infections, full-thickness ulceration and malignant transformation. 
1.6.  Protocol assistance 
The applicant received the following Protocol assistance on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application:

The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific

discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting 
a marketing authorisation to Filsuvez on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication for Filsuvez is: Treatment to achieve accelerated healing of wounds associated 
with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in patients from birth onwards. Thus, the 
indication targets two of the main sub-types of EB (see further description below). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare (‘orphan’) heterogeneous group of genetic skin fragility disorders 
characterised by blistering and erosions of epithelial surfaces in response to minor trauma or friction. 
Information on the epidemiology of EB is limited. Overall, data available from European countries are 
supported by data from the US NEBR and estimates of the prevalence of EB range from 4.4 (Romania) 
to 80 (United Kingdom; UK) per 1 million ([Dănescu 2015]; [Mellerio 2010]). Throughout the European 
Union (EU), it is estimated that EB affects less than 50 per 1 million (0.5 in 10,000 people) which is 
equivalent to fewer than 25,000 people in the EU. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
EB is caused by more than 1,000 known mutations in as many as 21 genes encoding anchoring 
proteins of the dermo-epidermal junction (Vahidnezhad 2019). Defects of these proteins lead to 
different levels of cleavage within the skin according to their location in the dermis and epidermis 
([Fine 2010]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 9/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2014, a revised EB consensus classification was published. It divides EB into 4 major subtypes, 
based on the level of skin cleavage [Fine 2014]: 
1.  Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS, intraepidermal skin separation). 
2.  Junctional  epidermolysis  bullosa  (JEB,  skin  separation  within  the  lamina  lucida  or  central 
basement membrane zone). 
3.  Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB, sublamina densa or dermal separation). Based on the 
mode of inheritance, this is subdivided into dominant (DDEB) and recessive (RDEB) forms. 
4.  Kindler syndrome (variable level of separation in the skin within basal keratinocytes, at the level 
of the lamina lucida or below the lamina densa). 
In 2020, an additional consensus report on the classification of EB and other skin fragility diseases was 
published [Has 2020]. Since the revised 2014 classification of EB, several new genes and clinical 
subtypes had been identified. This latest consensus report sought to reclassify disorders with skin 
fragility, with a focus on EB, based on new clinical and molecular data.

Abbreviations: DEB=dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa; EB=epidermolysis bullosa; EBS=epidermolysis 
bullosa simplex; JEB=junctional epidermolysis bullosa 
EBS is the most common subtype of EB and causes mild to moderate disease in the majority of cases. 
In the most frequent variant, localised EBS, blistering is usually limited to the hands and feet. There 
are also more severe variants of EBS, in particular generalised severe EBS [Coulombe 2009], but in 
general, EBS is almost always compatible with normal life span [Pillay 2008]. EBS wounds are 
generally episodic skin blistering in areas of the body prone to trauma or friction, smaller and more 
superficial than wounds in other subtypes of EB, and dynamic in nature with rapid onset and short 
healing cycles. As these wounds are smaller and more dynamic, subjects with EBS were not included in 
the pivotal Phase 3 study (BEB-13) to support the EB indication. With rare exceptions, EBS is inherited 
in an autosomal dominant fashion. 
JEB is less frequent and has a broad spectrum of severity, from the most severe form in the JEB, 
generalised severe subtype which is usually fatal in the first year of life, to generalised intermediate 
JEB which is associated with sepsis, failure to thrive, pseudosyndactyly, and shortened life expectancy, 
to very mild forms of JEB often diagnosed later in life. JEB has an autosomal recessive inheritance. 
DEB has 2 forms, dominant DEB (DDEB) and recessive DEB (RDEB), are defined by the mode of 
inheritance. Both forms cause moderate to severe skin fragility and scarring; DDEB is milder with more 
localised skin involvement often limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows, while patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 10/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RDEB have more extensive skin involvement especially in the generalised severe form. Hence, a high 
proportion of patients in EB specialist clinics have RDEB which enabled this severely affected group of 
patients to be enrolled into the BEB-13 study. Severely affected patients suffer from widespread 
blistering and painful wounds that cause multiple secondary medical complications (e.g., anaemia, 
malnutrition, oesophageal stenosis, susceptibility to infections) that often lead to physical impairment 
[Bruckner-Tuderman 2010]. In RDEB, particularly generalised severe RDEB, many patients survive 
only to their fourth decade as a result of aggressive metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that 
arises within areas of repeated scarring [Soro 2015]. 
Kindler syndrome is the rarest form of EB. In this subtype, blistering occurs at various skin depths. It 
is characterised by generalised blistering at birth and the later development of characteristic 
poikilodermatous pigmentation and photosensitivity. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
See above, regarding the clinical presentation and prognosis for different EB subtypes. 
2.1.5.  Management 
No approved therapy exists for EB in the EU. There are no medical treatments that have demonstrated 
efficacy in the treatment or prevention of the recognised clinical manifestations of this rare genetic 
disorder, which include debilitating symptoms and substantial morbidity; those with moderate to 
severe disease may have life-threatening manifestations and in a proportion of patients, the disease 
reduces life expectancy. 
One of the most significant problems in EB is the lifelong presence of skin blistering and partial-
thickness wounds that result in pruritus, pain, scarring, deformity, loss of function, and immobility as 
well as a high risk of complications such as infection. In addition, there is an increased incidence of 
aggressive cutaneous SCC at a younger age than in the general population. In patients with 
generalised severe RDEB, SCC occurs in approximately 80% of patients by their mid-40s and can occur 
as early as adolescence. 
Since no medicinal product is approved for the treatment of EB, symptomatic and professional wound 
care is the mainstay of therapeutic intervention. Patients may have several wounds affecting large 
areas of the body surface. Wounds need to be cleaned and non-adhesive dressings applied frequently 
to protect the wounds and enable healing to occur. The removal of the dressings involves soaking in 
warm water or using damp compresses. After cleansing the wounds, the new dressings are applied. 
The changing of dressings may be painful and time consuming. Patients with extensive wounds may 
rotate the dressing changes such that not all wounds are dressed at the same time. A range of 
emollients, such as petrolatum, are used in association with wound dressing; however, there is a 
paucity of scientific data on the effectiveness of emollients. An international consensus document on 
“Best Practice Guidelines for Skin and Wound Care in Epidermolysis Bullosa” was published [Denyer 
2017] in collaboration with the DEB Research Association, a global patient association focusing on EB. 
Avoiding infection in EB wounds is difficult and they are frequently colonised with bacteria that impair 
healing. Topical antibiotics and antimicrobial dressings are used judiciously to prevent or minimise 
bacterial colonisation. Wound infections, characterised by increasing wound size, exudate, odor, pain, 
surrounding erythema, and edema require treatment with topical and frequently systemic antibiotics. 
Recurrent or chronic wound infections may become resistant to standard antibiotics and thus 
increasingly difficult to eradicate and can lead to sepsis. Multidrug-resistant EB wound infections are 
problematic. Infections impair the ability of the wound to heal and a vicious cycle that is difficult to 
break ensues. 
Pain from partial-thickness wounds occurs as sensory nerve endings are present in the wound bed. 
This is especially distressing during dressing changes and is managed by the administration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 11/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics or opioids. The psychological impact of the pain associated 
with dressing changes is substantial and includes anticipatory anxiety that can be debilitating and 
traumatic for patients (most of whom are children) and their parents or caregivers. 
Skin pruritis is difficult to control and occurs in the majority of patients, particularly those with 
generalised severe RDEB ([De Palma 2019]; [Snauwaert 2014]). Intractable pruritus may result in 
difficulty falling asleep, disturbance of routines, change in behaviour, and loss of appetite [Jeffs 2020]. 
Antihistamines are widely used despite being generally ineffective in this setting. A variety of other oral 
medications with no scientific evidence demonstrating their effectiveness are also prescribed in an 
attempt to reduce the distress associated with chronic pruritus, e.g., corticosteroids, antiepileptics, 
tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5HT-3 receptor antagonists, and benzodiazepines. For the 
treatment of severe recalcitrant itching, agents such as thalidomide and cyclosporine are prescribed; 
however, there are limited data to support their use. 
Patients with EB need a higher calorie intake to compensate for the increased energy expenditure 
required for wound healing. However, patients with severe disease, such as many with RDEB, 
frequently have involvement of the gastrointestinal mucosa with oropharyngeal (including dental) 
manifestations. Buccal blistering may progress to fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. 
Erosions in the oesophagus, development of strictures and webbing may result in dysphagia [Fine 
2008]. The oesophageal complications often require repeated endoscopic dilatation procedures or 
surgical intervention and may eventually lead to the need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or 
nasogastric tube feeding. Vitamin and mineral supplements are commonly required. These 
gastrointestinal conditions impact the patient’s ability to achieve adequate calorie intake and may 
result in failure to thrive or develop, particularly in children [Shinkuma 2015], as well as reduced 
wound healing ability. Minerals deficiency, in particular zinc, also adversely affects wound healing as it 
is essential in this process [Reimer 2020]. 
In summary, the current treatment of EB wounds is symptomatic, including early judicious treatment 
of wounds to prevent or minimize infection and wound protection with non-adhesive dressings to 
enable wound healing. Patients with EB take care to minimise new wounds; however, this is 
particularly difficult for young children as minor trauma or friction results in partial-thickness wounds. 
The efficacy of topical agents aimed at improving wound healing may have direct implications on 
outcomes and quality of life for patients with EB. There is currently no topical medication approved in 
the EU to accelerate wound healing. With regular application of such a product, the total wound burden 
and associated symptoms and complications of unhealed wounds such as infections, itching, and pain 
would be expected to decrease. Most experts agree that “any acceleration” and “each day gained” in 
time to wound healing would be important and clinically significant for EB patients with partial-
thickness wounds. 
2.2.  About the product 
Filsuvez (also referred to as Oleogel-S10 in this report) is a non-aqueous gel containing (per gram) 
100 mg of extract (as dry extract, refined) from Betula pendula Roth, Betula pubescens Ehrh. as well 
as hybrids of both species, cortex (equivalent to 0.5-1.0 g birch bark), including 84-95 mg triterpenes 
calculated as the sum of betulin, betulinic acid, erythrodiol, lupeol and oleanolic acid. Extraction 
solvent: n-Heptane. 
Oleogel-S10 is formulated with sunflower oil (90%) and has thixotropic properties that facilitate 
application to the wound. Thus, Oleogel-S10 behaves as a viscous gel under normal conditions but 
becomes less viscous when applied. 
The indication initially applied for was: Treatment to achieve accelerated healing of wounds associated 
with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in patients from birth onwards. See section 
2.6.6. for final indication granted by CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 12/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed posology is as follows: The gel should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of 
approximately 1 mm and covered by a sterile non-adhesive wound dressing or, applied to the dressing 
so that the gel is in direct contact with the wound. The gel should not be applied sparingly. It should 
not be rubbed in. The gel should be reapplied at each wound dressing change, until the wound is 
healed. 
The product in the same concentration and formulation is already approved in the EU (date of 
authorisation 14 January 2016) as Episalvan gel, approved for the treatment of partial thickness 
wounds in adults. The active substance has shown to accelerate re-epithelialization in an in vitro 
wound scratch assay using human primary keratinocytes at the dosage of 1 μg/ml, and in a porcine ex 
vivo wound healing model at the dosage of 10 µg/ml.  
The precise mechanism of action of the active substance in wound healing in humans is not known. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The primary clinical data in support of the EB indication for Filsuvez is a single phase 3 study (BEB-13), 
with some support also from a small phase 2 study in EB patients; BEB-10. In addition, the studies 
included in the submission for Episalvan in the indication “Treatment of split-thickness skin graft 
(STSG) donor site wounds” were included in the dossier as supportive data. Furthermore, Phase 2 
healthy subject studies with the control gel (AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B) are referred to in support of the 
EB application. 
There is no CHMP guidance available on the development of medicinal products in EB. The Applicant 
received Scientific Advice from the CHMP for the EB indication, see section 1.6. Protocol assistance.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as gel containing 100 mg of extract per 1 g of gel (as dry extract, 
refined) from Betula pendula Roth, Betula pubescens Ehrh. as well as hybrids of both species, cortex 
(equivalent to 0.5-1.0 g birch bark), including 84-95 mg triterpenes calculated as the sum of betulin, 
betulinic acid, erythrodiol, lupeol and oleanolic acid. The extraction solvent is n-heptane. 
The only other ingredient is refined sunflower oil.  
The product is available in white collapsible aluminium tube, interior lacquered with epoxy phenolic 
coating, and with a sealing compound in the fold. The tube is closed with a tamper evident aluminium 
membrane and fitted with a white polypropylene screw cap, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. It 
is available in two sizes, 9.4 g and 23.4 g tubes. The product is for single use only and should be used 
immediately after opening and then discarded. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The dossier contains appropriate information on both the herbal substance (birch bark) as well as the 
herbal preparation/active substance (dry extract from birch bark). 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 13/162 
 
 
 
 
The part of the birch used is the white part of the bark, Betula cork (phellem), which is the outer part 
of the bark, produced by the cork cambium (phellogen) in woody plants. Appropriate declarations were 
provided confirming the herbal substance is sourced according to the principles of the guideline on 
Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (GACP) for starting materials of herbal origin. The main 
constituents in the bark of birch are pentacyclic triterpenes. The outer bark of birch contains a large 
amount of betulin and related triterpenes lupeol, betulinic acid, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid. One 
property of the outer bark is the resistance against microorganisms, said to be because of the suberin 
(cork substance) and the hydrophobic and antimicrobial effect of betulin. 
The herbal preparation is the dry extract from birch bark; it appears as a white to almost white dry 
powder. The herbal preparation, which is the active substance of the finished product, is also referred 
to in the dossier as Triterpene Extract (TE). The extract is refined and is declared as a ‘quantified 
extract’ as defined in the EMA ‘Guideline on declaration of herbal substances and herbal preparations in 
herbal medicinal products/traditional herbal medicinal products’ 
(EMA/HMPC/CHMP/CVMP/287539/2005/Rev 1). The quantification is determined with respect to five 
triterpene markers: betulin, lupeol, betulinic acid, erythrodiol and oleanolic acid. The DER value is 
5-10:1. The extraction solvent is n-heptane.  
The main constituents of the herbal preparation are pentacyclic triterpenes from the lupane (betulin, 
lupeol, betulinic acid) and oleanane (erythrodiol, oleanolic acid) groups. These are illustrated in Figure 
2. 
Figure 2: active substance structure 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Herbal substance (birch bark) 
The birch species used for production are Betula pendula Roth (silver birch) and Betula pubescens 
Ehrh. (white birch) as well as hybrids of both species. Trees are collected in accordance with GACP 
requirements. The bark is stripped, dried and cut. The last cutting/sieving is under GMP standard (QP 
declarations have been provided). 
Herbal preparation (dry extract from birch bark)  
The dry extract is manufactured using extraction with n-heptane.  
QP declarations have been provided confirming that the manufacturing complies with the principles and 
guidelines of good manufacturing practice. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 14/162 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process is validated and shown to be robust and result in batch-to-batch 
consistency. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications and controls of the herbal substance are adequately drawn up and in line with Ph. Eur. 
and EMA guideline requirements. Control of impurities include heavy metals/elemental impurities, 
mycotoxins, pesticides, radioactivity and microbial load. 
The active substance specification includes tests for: characters (visual), identification (GC-FID 
fingerprint, HPLC-DAD fingerprint), degradation products (GC-FID fingerprint, HPLC-DAD fingerprint), 
residual solvents (GC- FID), elemental impurities (ICP-OES), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.), assay (GC-
FID), consistency of a test oleogel (texture analyser), segregation of oil of a test oleogel 
(centrifugation), and specific surface area (Ph. Eur. volumetric method). 
Specific impurities controlled are elemental impurities as well as residues of the extraction solvent 
n-heptane. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay has been presented. 
Batch data has been provided for a large number of batches. Data comply with the specification and 
batch-to-batch consistency has been investigated and presented. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months with no special 
storage precautions in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The medicinal product is a herbal medicinal product containing the herbal preparation dry extract from 
birch bark (5-10:1), extraction by n-heptane, as the active substance. 
The finished product is presented as a semi-solid preparation called an oleogel, a lipophilic colourless 
to slightly yellowish opalescent gel for cutaneous application.  
Triterpene Extract (TE) is not soluble in water but forms an oleogel on mixing with oil. A 10% w/w 
concentration in sunflower oil was determined as optimal for use as a topical gel. There are no other 
excipients. 
Filsuvez, also referred to as Oleogel-S10, is a gel intended for topical use in the treatment of wounds 
associated with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in patients from 6 months of age. 
Therefore, it is a sterile gel, for single use only. Once opened, the product should be used immediately 
and discarded after use. It is described as a viscous, thixotropic, water-free preparation with a 
consistency similar to petroleum jelly that will not soften at body temperature. The thixotropic 
properties facilitate the product to be expressed from the tube and applied to the wound where it will 
not move.  
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 15/162 
 
 
 
 
Pivotal clinical trials in epidermolysis bullosa, BEB-13, were conducted using Oleogel-S10 
manufactured according to the process described in the dossier. 
Investigations on the microbiological attributes demonstrate that the finished product shows 
microbiologically hostile conditions. 
The finished product is filled and stored in white 10 ml or 25 ml collapsible aluminium tubes, closed by 
an aluminium membrane and a white PP screw cap. The container closure system is a standard 
packaging material for this type of dosage form. The materials in contact with the finished product are 
in compliance with the food legislation in accordance with EMA CPMP/QWP/4359/03 Guideline on 
Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials. The packaging is considered suitable for the proposed 
application. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product is relatively simple where the active substance, i.e. 
the dry extract from birch bark, is mixed and homogenised with sunflower oil.  
In process controls and critical steps are clearly described and justified. Holding times were validated 
and are acceptable. The applicant demonstrates good process understanding. 
The sterilisation process is validated for both tube sizes and is considered to be acceptable. 
Process validation data were provided for three consecutive full size batches of the 25 ml tube, and the 
data indicated that the process is capable of reproducibly producing a product of consistent quality. 
The bulk manufacturing process for the 10 ml tube is considered the same as that validated for the 
25 ml tube. Process validation for the smaller tube size has also been submitted and is also considered 
to be acceptable. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  description  (visual),  identification  (GC-FID,  HPLC-DAD),  degradation  products  (GC-FID,  HPLC-
DAD), assay (GC-FID), assays of amount of triterpene extract (GC-FID), sterility (Ph. Eur.), container 
closure system integrity (dye ingress), acid value (titration), peroxide value (titration), fineness of grind 
(EN ISO1524:2013),  viscosity  (Ph. Eur.),  segregation of oil  (centrifugation), and consistency (texture 
analyser). 
The proposed specification parameters and limits are acceptable. The potential presence of elemental 
impurities in the finished product has been assessed in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental 
Impurities. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed as it was requested by CHMP as a Major Objection, considering all suspected and 
actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). The applicant has during the procedure updated and 
subsequently submitted an acceptable risk evaluation regarding potential nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product, thereby resolving the Major Objection. Based on the information provided, it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 16/162 
 
 
 
 
 
accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished 
product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for numerous batches of different scale confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  commercial  scale  batches  of  23.4  g  in  25  ml  tubes  presentation  finished  product 
stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH and for three batches 30°C / 
75% RH) and for three batches up to six months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. Additionally, a stability study has been initiated with one pilot scale 
batch  of  the  9.4  g  in  10-ml  tubes  presentation  at  both  long-term  (25°C  /60%  RH,  48  months)  and 
accelerated (40°C/75% RH, 6 months) conditions. Data is available for up to 12 months under long term 
conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH). The batches 
of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No out of specification results were observed and 
the results are comparable between batches. 
The possible impact of the different tube lengths with regard to stability was evaluated. Importantly, in 
both pack sizes the tube is completely filled with the gel with only a very small volume of air (unavoidable 
for technical reasons) trapped inside at the fold of the tube. The different tube length alters the surface-
to-volume ratio of the primary packaging material and the gel. Compared to the 23.4 g pack size, the 
surface-to-volume ratio is increased by 36% for the 9.4 g pack size. With the only difference between 
the 23.4-g and 9.4-g pack size being the length of the tube, the stability demonstrated for the 23.4-g 
presentation  is  considered  to  be  representative  also  for  the  smaller  (shorter)  9.4-g  presentation. 
Accordingly, the same shelf-life claim is acceptable for both. 
Considering the demonstrated stability of the 23.4 g pack size with no evidence of degradation, the fact 
that  the  aluminum  tube  is  virtually  impenetrable  and  the  small  difference  in  surface-to-volume  ratio 
minimizing a potential (expected negligible) impact of small amounts of trapped air in the sealed tube, 
it is justified to extrapolate the stability results and the shelf-life claim of the original 23.4 g pack size to 
the 9.4 g pack size. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years when stored below 30°C as stated 
in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and finished product are the same as for the authorised product Episalvan 
(formerly Oleogel-S10). Since the assessment of Episalvan, the dossier has been updated with 
additional development work, validation as well as batch and stability data. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The Major Objection 
raised on risk assessment on the presence of nitrosamine impurities was adequately resolved by 
providing an updated risk assessment during the procedure. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The initial non-clinical package performed for Episalvan for treatment of partial thickness wounds 
allowed for a treatment duration of up to 4 weeks. Since then, the non-clinical package has been 
expanded to cover chronic wound treatment of EB patients.  
In wound healing models, TE showed inflammation-modulating effects, stimulation of keratinocyte 
migration and differentiation, and accelerated re-epithelialisation. 
No in vivo EB animal model is available that can recapitulate the fragility of the skin and the low 
solubility of the active constituents has caused limitations in regarding which administration routes can 
be used for in vivo studies. However, Oleogel-S10, gel, TE and its main constituents were investigated 
using a set of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo test systems evaluated by the applicant. In addition, 
supporting data was derived from published literature.   
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The wound healing properties of Oleogel-S10 and the triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) have 
been studied in a variety of in vitro and ex vivo studies. The applicant has presented results on 
accelerated re-epithelialisation in the in vitro wound scratch test using human primary keratinocytes. 
Further, the porcine ex vivo wound healing model, where punch biopsies are taken from the plicae of 
pig ears, has been shown to have similarity to the human wound healing process. In the porcine ex 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 18/162 
 
 
 
 
vivo wound healing model, TE exhibited acceleration of dermis re-epithelialisation at the dosage of 
10 µg/ml. Nevertheless, no proof of concept studies have been provided and the applicant has asserted 
that the previous studies using a porcine wound healing model are applicable to the EB population. 
However, in patients with dystrophic and junctional EB the integrity of the skin barrier is affected by 
mutations in genes responsible for the expression of structural proteins involved in influencing the 
integrity and adhesion of the skin. The applicant was therefore asked to discuss any potential 
consequences of these mutations to undermine the pharmacological action of Oleogel-S10. In the 
response, the applicant suggested that the components of the birch bark extract act on the general 
mechanism of wound healing and is not limited to a single pathway. Furthermore, the birch bark 
extract induces re-epithelialisation and keratinocyte migration which are not directly affected by these 
mutations. However, based on evidence in the literature, COL7A1 expression, whose gene is frequently 
mutated in DEB, was required for re-epithelialisation through organisation of laminin-332 at the 
dermal-epidermal junction and affected keratinocyte migration (Nyström et al., 2013). Therefore, it 
remains unclear how mutations in COL7A1, and or other genes mutated in EB, may negatively impact 
the pharmacological action of the birch bark extract. Furthermore, the applicant suggested that 
Filsuvez accelerates the re-epithelialisation of wounds in part by enhancement of keratinocyte 
proliferation. However, the birch bark extract or its components did not induce proliferation in the 
submitted in vitro and ex vivo pharmacology studies which seems to contradict this assertion. 
It was suggested that no suitable pre-clinical EB model exists in which Filsuvez could be tested. This 
issue was not further pursued from a non-clinical perspective as ultimately, it is accepted that the 
clinical efficacy data from such patients which will determine whether Filsuvez is effective.  
In addition, the applicant has performed studies on cellular mechanisms in human primary 
keratinocytes. However, human re-epithelialisation includes a combination of multiple factors and 
various in vitro models typically address a single factor. The results from in vitro studies on the active 
substance of Oleogel-S10 showed influence on different mediators of the re-epithelialisation process 
but cannot explain the mechanism of action in patients. Hence, the clinical relevance of these in vitro 
findings is not known.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies addressing secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed. This is considered 
acceptable given the low systemic exposure from dermal application of Oleogel-S10 to EB patients. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies on the triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) in sesame oil were 
performed in dogs via intraduodenal administration and in mice and rats via intraperitoneal 
administration. Isolated ileum from guinea pig was also used in an in vitro safety pharmacology study. 
A hERG study was performed where betulin-induced inhibition of the hERG tail current amplitude was 
recorded in HEK293 cells. While a significant inhibition of the tail current was noted at 200 nM 
(maximum feasible concentration), the inhibition was less than 30% compared to control. No EC50-
value could be estimated. However, there were concerns with this study which question its utility in 
drawing conclusions as to the effects of betulin on the hERG channel. These concerns included the lack 
of an expiry date for the test article, inhibition of the hERG channel at middle dose concentration of 
12.61 nM which was very similar to that seen at the higher concentration of 190 nM (22 versus 23% 
inhibition) and significant differences in the nominal concentrations of betulin compared to the 
achieved values measured. In the response, the applicant suggested that a 1-year warranty from the 
date of receipt was provided by the supplier of the betulin and the assay was conducted within this 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 19/162 
 
 
 
 
time period. However, no actual data or certification was however provided to support this claim. It 
was also noted that the expiry data of the test article was excluded from the GLP compliance 
statement for the study.  Regarding the inhibition of the hERG-channel at the middle dose, the 
applicant explained that the reason for the non-linear inhibition of hERG activity is unknown but may 
be related to non-specific binding to either the cell surface or to plastics. The latter has been seen to 
particularly occur at low concentrations and likely explain the difference in nominal versus achieved 
concentration values. An IC50 could not be determined as higher concentrations than 200nM were not 
technically feasible.  
Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were studied at doses of up to 300 mg of TE/kg in beagle 
dogs, central nervous parameters at doses of up to 300 mg TE/kg in mice, gastrointestinal parameters 
at doses of up to 300 mg of TE/kg in mice and renal parameters at doses of up to 500 mg TE/kg in 
rats. No test item related effects have been observed. 
No exposure data were obtained in the safety pharmacology studies and no toxicokinetic data were 
available from intraduodenal administration in dogs or intraperitoneal administration in mice, therefore 
the relevance for the clinical situation from these studies is unclear. However, based on low systemic 
exposure following topical application in the clinical setting, these shortcomings are not of importance. 
Overall, it is considered that the risk for CV-related adverse effects following clinical use of Filsuvez is 
very low. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. This is considered acceptable 
given the low systemic exposure from topical application of Oleogel-S10 to EB patients. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A number of non-clinical studies have been performed by the applicant to characterise the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of Filsuvez. The studies involving human tissues and cells have mainly been 
assessed in the clinical PK section. 
Methods of analysis 
The methods used in the programme have been appropriately described, and the bioanalytical 
methods are considered adequate based on the provided validation reports. 
Absorption 
No dedicated studies to characterize the PK profiles of betulin in plasma have been performed. 
However, the exposure to betulin (mouse, minipig) and betulinic acid (minipig only) was evaluated in 
the dermal repeated-dose toxicity studies as detailed in the toxicokinetics section. Dermal exposure to 
Oleogel-S10 resulted in no to very low exposures to betulin and betulinic acid in the 4-week study in 
minipig. However, in the 9-month study, exposures up to 184 and 58 ng/ml for betulin and betulinic 
acid respectively were noted. Further, a possible slight accumulation of betulin with time was observed 
for male and female animals treated once daily with 50 mL Oleogel-S10/animal by dermal application. 
Distribution 
A protein binding study was performed where the in vitro protein binding of betulin was determined in 
human, rat, and minipig plasma. Collectively the study indicates that unbound fraction of betulin in 
plasma is below 0.1% and the fraction bound (fb,p) is > 99.9% in all species tested. 
Metabolism 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 20/162 
 
 
 
 
In vitro metabolism of betulin has been evaluated in mouse, rat, minipig and human. Four human main 
metabolites were identified, three of which were covered in at least one non-clinical species. The 
human metabolite M4 (19% abundance relative to parent) was not covered in any of the non-clinical 
species. However, considering that the metabolite is a phase 2 metabolite (sulfation metabolite of 
betulin) it is not considered likely that it is of toxicological concern given the limited toxicity of the 
parent. Accordingly, no further metabolite studies are considered needed. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Testing strategy 
The toxicity profile of TE has been examined in male and female mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and minipigs. 
Animals were exposed to the test-item dermally (the intended route of administration in patients), but 
also via the oral gavage, intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) route to observe different 
exposure levels following different routes of administration.  
Acute dose toxicity studies with s.c. and i.p. application were performed in mice and rats. Non-pivotal 
repeat dose toxicity studies with TE or Oleogel-S10, gel were performed in mice (14-day dermal), rats 
(14-day i.p.), rabbits (7-day oral) and dogs (14-day i.p.). No Segment II studies in rabbits were 
performed because of lack of systemic exposure following oral administration in this species. 
Pivotal studies include repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice (13-week dermal), rats (4-week oral and 
6-month oral), dogs (4-week s.c.) and minipigs (4-week and 9-month dermal; intact and wounded 
skin). The 4-week dermal study in minipigs applied an occluded setting, where the administration site 
is covered by an occlusive dressing after treatment. In contrast, the 9 months dermal study on 
minipigs left the treatment sites open/non-occluded. 
The genotoxicity profile of TE was evaluated in an Ames test, and an in vitro clastogenic activity study. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with TE or Oleogel-S10, gel.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with TE were performed following oral administration 
in rats and included evaluation of male and female fertility, embryo-fetal development and pre- and 
post-natal development. In addition, a toxicity study was performed in the juvenile rat with 
administration through oral gavage.  
The sensitisation potential of TE was assessed in a standard assay in guinea pigs. The phototoxic 
potential of TE was evaluated in an in vitro 3T3-NRU assay and the photoallergic potential was 
assessed in an in vivo study in guinea pigs, respectively. The risk after inadvertent exposure of 
Oleogel-S10, gel to the eye was evaluated in a bovine corneal opacity assay. 
The toxicity studies were performed with different formulations of TE. The pivotal dermal toxicity 
studies were performed with the final formulation of Oleogel-S10, gel (Filsuvez). 
The applicant has ensured that all studies were conducted in compliance with GLP and in accordance 
with current European and ICH guidance. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
TE was administered to mice and rats as single i.p. or s.c. injections at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. The 
LD50 values for the male and female animals at 24 hours and 14 days after i.p. administration could 
not be calculated as no mortality was observed (>2000 mg/kg; highest tested dose). Published data 
were also provided to support low acute toxicity of the constituents of TE (Betulinic acid, Oleanolic acid 
and Lupeol). 
Both mice and rats showed slightly reduced motility, ataxia, dyspnoea and reduced muscle tone after 
i.p injections of 500 mg/kg or more. In addition, white deposits/whitish layers on the 
Assessment report

diaphragm/abdominal organs, adhesions of kidney, spleen, stomach, liver, intestines or all abdominal 
organs was obvious upon necropsy. The applicant did not mention these findings but claimed that TE 
was well tolerated by both species when administered as single i.p. or s.c. injections at doses up to 
2000 mg/kg. It is assumed that the reduced motility, ataxia, dyspnoea and reduced muscle tone are a 
secondary effect of the deposits caused by the i.p. injections of the test item and its vehicle. In the 
single dose experiments, no control groups were included. It is hence not possible to deduce whether 
the effects are caused by the test item or the vehicle. Due to the solubility issues of the TE, the 
Applicant has explored several different animal models for the repeat dose studies and it appeared that 
the i.p. route is not suitable for higher doses of TE in the vehicles tested.  
Based on the results from the dose repeat studies described below, further tests regarding single dose 
toxicity are not considered justified. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat dose toxicity studies submitted for the Episalvan MAA have been supplemented with a 
number of new studies. Due to the solubility issues of the TE, the Applicant has explored several 
different animal models and routes of administration, in order to obtain a satisfactory systemic 
distribution, as measured by plasma levels of betulin.  
After s.c., i.p., administration, a small systemic distribution was observed, but as the applicant stated 
it; these repeat dose toxicity studies did not reveal any systemic toxicity of TE except for local, irritant 
and inflammatory effects related to the application of a substance nearly insoluble in aqueous systems. 
Despite the shortcomings of several of the repeat dose tests, through solubility issues etc., a small but 
obvious systemic distribution was observed in all species, regardless of the route of administration. 
After administration through oral gavage, a higher systemic exposure, with a dose related increase in 
plasma levels of betulin was seen. This administration route was also used in the tests on reproductive 
and developmental toxicity. After oral gavage, slight effects were observed regarding body weight and 
food intake, and similar to other administration routes, inflammatory effects were seen in some 
animals. It is agreed that the effects seen are related to solubility issues and the vehicles used in the 
respective studies. 
As the product is intended for dermal use and a low systemic absorption was observed in humans after 
dermal administration, it was not considered justified to perform additional studies regarding the 
effects of systemic exposure. It should also be emphasised that a background exposure to betulin from 
food sources etc. is anticipated in patients. In the clinical assessments, a betulin background plasma 
level of up to 54.5 ng/ml was observed in untreated patients. 
Dermal application studies have been performed in both mice and minipigs. In mice, the Oleogel-S10 
gel was applied once daily for 13 weeks without occlusion. Whilst treatment was associated with a 16% 
increase in mean terminal body weight and a 58% increase in mean body weight gain in females 
compared with the control mean, it was noted that this treatment group was heavier at start of 
treatment and food consumption was higher. No other systemic effects were noted and the gel was 
well tolerated at the application site with no local tolerance issues. Dermal administration of the 
product to minipigs, produces a low but robust systemic distribution. The highest measured Cmax was 
339 ng/ml in male mice after 13 weeks treatment and 184 ng/ml in minipigs treated for 39 weeks. A 
slight accumulation of betulin with time was observed for both male and female minipigs after 4 weeks 
as well as 39 weeks of treatment. No signs of accumulation were however observed in mice after 13 
weeks of dermal administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 22/162 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of administration in the dermal studies is either once daily (13 Week mouse study and 9 
months, minipigs) or three times weekly (4 weeks sub-chronic minipig study). This should be 
compared to the suggested posology and method of administration in the SmPC. 
As no comparison or discussion was included regarding frequency of administration or dose applied in 
the repeat dose studies, compared to what is suggested in the SmPC, the Applicant was requested to 
further evaluate this. In the day 120 response, the Applicant has provided sufficient clarifications. It 
was agreed that the frequency of administration and systemic exposures achieved in the non-clinical 
studies provide adequate justification for the proposed posology. 
After dermal administration of either Oleogel-S10, gel or its vehicle, several reactions were observed at 
the site of administration in minipigs (but not in mice): 
- 
Four weeks treatment of abraded or intact skin with Oleogel-S10, gel caused inflammatory 
effects, particularly lympho-histiocytic inflammatory cell infiltration and epithelial hyperplasia, 
to the application site in both abraded and intact skin.  
-  Nine months treatment of intact skin with either vehicle and Oleogel-S10, gel, caused 
epidermal hyperplasia, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, dermal lymphocytic and/or neutrophilic 
infiltration, and pustules in the stratum corneum.  
Vehicle treated controls were included only in the 39-week study, while the 4 weeks study applied 
occlusive wound dressing without further treatment as controls. The combination of vehicle and 
occlusive dressing has not been tested.  
In the primary assessment of the application, duration of treatment, state of the treated skin, 
characteristics of the triterpenes, repeated covering of wounds with an oily material, and the use of 
occlusive dressings, were all pointed out as factors of potential importance for the local inflammatory 
reactions seen in minipigs.  
In order to evaluate the impact of each factor to the overall responses seen, the applicant was asked 
to compare the findings within the respective treatment groups of the different studies. The study 
designs however were too different to enable direct comparison between the treatment groups, and 
the results were inconclusive between the two studies.  
The comparisons indicate that the presence of the insoluble triterpenes in an open (or partially healed) 
wound, as well as the repeated administration of the oily product may contribute to the inflammatory 
reactions seen in these two dermal repeat use studies.  
The applicant additionally emphasised that the use of occlusive dressings is standard of care in EB, and 
observations from the clinical experience did not raise any safety concerns referring to the use of 
occlusive dressings and their effect on the inflammatory reactions to the product. 
The applicant emphasised that activation of the immune system with infiltration of immune cells and 
production of inflammatory substances such as interleukins and cytokines are natural parts of the 
healing process.  
It was indeed noted in the primary assessment that the reactions seen in healthy animals in the repeat 
dose studies, were very similar to the desired effects, tested and discussed within the sections on 
pharmacology. The applicant was hence requested to discuss the similarities and differences between 
the desired effects in wound healing (i.e., inflammation-modulating effects, stimulation of keratinocyte 
migration and differentiation, and accelerated re-epithelialisation) as compared to the same effects 
potentially causing adverse events such as the commonly reported complications in wound healing.   
The Applicant emphasised that, as no dedicated endpoints for evaluation of the wound healing process 
in animals with wounded skin have been included, no conclusion in terms of wound healing can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 23/162 
 
 
 
 
drawn from the obtained data. However, based on a macroscopic analysis as well as histopathology 
results, study 26742 did not point to any complications associated with wound healing (i.e., 
impairment, significant inhibition of wound healing, or re-opening of wounds) following treatment with 
Filsuvez. 
As regards the adverse events classified as ‘wound complication’ in the clinical studies, no histological 
assessments are performed. It is acknowledged that a generalised ‘wound complication’ cannot be 
differentiated from local reactions to the product, or from the natural course of the disease, without 
detailed information from histological examinations of the wound tissue.  
It should however be emphasised that the inflammatory reactions were also observed in the dermal 
repeat use studies on healthy animals with intact skin, which cannot be attributed solely to the natural 
wound healing process. The concern that the inflammatory reactions would potentially induce local 
tumorigenesis remains a cause for concern. It is well known that a chronic immune response may lead 
to tumorigenesis.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of TE was studied in in vitro mutagenicity assays (Ames test and chromosome 
aberrations test in human lymphocytes) and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.  
Neither of the in vitro tests showed any mutagenic or genotoxic potential, nor did the in vivo 
micronucleus test. The relevance of the in vivo test was however questioned as it was performed 
through i.p. administration, and betulin plasma levels were not determined during the test.  
Given the results of the repeat dose toxicity studies, i.p. is considered to be an inappropriate 
administration route for observation of systemic effects of TE. The oral gavage, for example produced 
a higher systemic absorption. A satisfactory systemic exposure was therefore not obtained in the in 
vivo chromosomal aberrations test. 
The non-clinical package on genotoxicity is hence considered incomplete. As the product is intended for 
local use with low systemic absorption in humans, it is not considered justified to perform additional in 
vivo, systemic studies on genotoxicity. The issue is not further pursued. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
The applicant requested a waiver for systemic carcinogenicity studies and proposed a dermal 
carcinogenicity study to be performed post-approval. As previously stated, the direct effect of Oleogel-
S10 on cell differentiation and/or proliferation, i.e., an underlying potential local carcinogenic action, 
was considered a risk. It was however acknowledged, that additional systemic tests would not be 
relevant for this application. Bearing in mind that the product is intended for dermal use with low 
systemic absorption in humans, it was considered justified to exclude further systemic testing of the 
genotoxicity or the potential carcinogenicity.  
Within the scientific advice (SA) requested in 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/2/2018/PA/SME/II), the 
CHMP advised the applicant to use in vitro approaches in diseased cells aimed specifically at EB. Such 
studies have not been submitted within the application or reflected upon by the Applicant. More 
generalised wound healing models have been used. 
Within the same SA, the applicant was advised to include proliferation biomarkers (e.g. Ki67) in a 3 or 
6 months study to confirm the absence of a potential risk. Also, histopathological findings during the 
recovery period (e.g. increased proliferation) were considered of importance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 24/162 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the information in this section, several aspects from the dermal repeat dose studies were 
considered. The 4- and 39-weeks study on minipigs that receive dermal treatment with Oleogel-S10 or 
its vehicle, sunflower oil, are hence considered pivotal.  
The applicant repeatedly stated that no preneoplastic or neoplastic findings were observed in the 
dermal repeat dose studies. There were however a number of findings from the dermal repeat dose 
studies, i.e., epidermal hyperplasia, etc. that needed further elucidation. The applicant clarified that 
the treatment sites were assessed by experienced dermato-pathologists and were subsequently peer 
reviewed. In the dermal repeat dose studies, no benign or malignant neoplasms were observed at the 
sites of application of Filsuvez. Epidermal hyperplasia was noted at the treatment sites following the 
administration of Filsuvez for 13 or 39 weeks. This finding was characterised by an increased number 
of cells in the lower epidermis, however there was no evidence of any unusual features such as cellular 
atypia and the epidermis showed normal cellular stratification. The applicant was of the view that this 
appearance was not consistent with pre-neoplasia and was typically observed as part of a normal 
regenerative process. Significant regression of the hyperplasia was observed by the end of the 4-week 
recovery period. 
The results of in vitro and ex vivo pharmacology studies indicated that TE or its components did not 
induce proliferation. In in vivo studies in actinic keratosis patients with TE, a decrease / normalisation 
of Ki67 expression was seen. An increase in Ki67-positive cells was observed in the intact skin of 
minipigs, treated with Oleogel-S10, gel for 39 weeks, while a reduction in Ki67-positive cells was seen 
after 4 weeks treatment (abraded skin, not seen in intact skin).  
In the analysis of Ki67-stained skin samples in the 39 weeks study, an increased epidermal thickness 
was also observed at the administration sites in both sexes compared to untreated controls. An 
increase in Ki67 positive cells as well as epidermal thickness, albeit not statistically significant, was 
observed also for vehicle treated animals. The applicant stated that the observed (small) increase in 
epidermal cell proliferation and epidermal thickness was considered in part to be associated with 
normal skin regeneration and in part to be due to the physical effects of the long-term application of 
test material to normal skin rather than the primary pharmacological effects of birch bark extract. 
There is a general lack of understanding of the pharmacological target of the components of the 
triterpene extract. As indicated in the applicant’s proof of concept studies, a key mechanism of action 
of the Oleogel-S10 may be the upregulation of IL-6 and subsequent activation of Stat3 signalling. As 
there was evidence of increased IL-6 signalling in EB, this action added to the concerns regarding the 
potential risk for local site carcinogenicity. IL-6 has been demonstrated to be a key player in the 
growth of epithelial tumours including head and neck SCC and oesophageal SCC (Choudhary et al., 
2016; Wu et al., 2017; Qiao et al., 2018). It has been hypothesised that hyper-activation of the IL-6 
signalling cascade could explain the increased risk of RDEB patients to develop SCC (Condorelli et al., 
2019). The applicant was therefore requested to provide a robust discussion on the specific risk for 
local site carcinogenicity with the topical use of Filsuvez, taking into account the proposed mechanism 
of action, the underlying risk in the EB patient population, and the histopathological findings from the 
39-week study in minipigs.   
The applicant argued that the induction of IL-6 by the TE was transient in nature primarily based on 
observations in the porcine WHM and primary keratinocytes as published in Ebeling et al, 2014. 
However, since the studies performed by Ebeling et al. used a single administration of the TE, their 
relevance to chronic use is limited. Therefore, there is no information on the potential levels of IL-6 
induction and STAT3 activation after repeated administration with the TE. 
The absence of a mutagenic/genotoxic risk associated with the TE is acknowledged and there is no 
concern for carcinogenic potential via a genotoxic mechanism. The histopathology results from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 25/162 
 
 
 
 
chronic repeat dose toxicity studies in minipigs provide some assurance, however, these were in the 
context of healthy animals who did not have an underlying predisposition to developing skin 
malignancies. 
A potential theoretical risk of carcinogenicity remained in the EB patient population based on the 
reputed pharmacology of the TE. Based on the presented data however, the risk that Filsuvez would 
cause malignancies directly or through chronic inflammations, was considered small.  
A number of precautions and follow up measures were enforced and/or are planned, such as a warning 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC, a follow-up Questionnaire for Skin Malignancies and a registry-based study 
as routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities, respectively, to monitor the risk of SCC 
(including other skin malignancies), listing of SCC and other malignancies as an important potential 
risk in the RMP. Therefore, the issue was not pursued further from a non-clinical perspective (see 
sections 2.6 and 2.7 of this report). 
The applicant proposed to perform a dermal carcinogenicity study in the mouse post-authorisation. ICH 
S1A does allow for carcinogenicity studies to be performed post-approval for life threatening or 
severely debilitating diseases. However, it needs to be considered that although the unmet medical 
need in these patients is appreciated, the therapy is symptom modifying rather than disease 
modifying. Cases of SCC have already been identified in clinical trials. It is arguable that a negative 
dermal carcinogenicity study, performed in healthy animals with no underlying genetic mutation that 
may predispose them to developing SCC, may fully provide assurance as to no increased risk for 
carcinogenesis in the proposed patient population.  
In addition, the mouse was not considered a suitable species for the intended study, since the local 
reactions seen after dermal administration to minipigs were absent in mice, when treated dermally for 
13 weeks.  
The absence of a suitable model resembling the EB patient population for carcinogenicity testing is 
acknowledged and the fact that rodents are historically used as the species for testing. However, the 
limitations of the study for the intended patient population remain. The theoretical risk of repeated IL-
6 induction and STAT3 signalling activation, which may be exacerbated in this patient population, 
cannot be excluded by evidence provided by the applicant. In addition, there are significant differences 
in the skin of mice compared to humans and potential for differences in systemic exposure.  
Taken together the relevance of negative findings in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice was thus 
questioned. Based on the above, and in line with the principles of “three Rs”, the applicant’s proposal 
to submit a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice as a post-approval commitment was not supported by 
the CHMP. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day 
via oral gavage no effects were seen on fertility and mating indices in either males or females.  
Similarly, in the EFD study in rats the test article was well tolerated with no evidence of maternal 
toxicity at doses up to 100 mg/kg. No treatment-related effects were seen on the mean number of 
corpora lutea, pre- and post-implantation loss, resorptions (early and late resorptions), or dead 
foetuses. However, a statistically significant reduction in the mean number of implantations was seen 
across all test article groups. This correlated with a similar decrease in the mean number of live 
foetuses and litter weight. As dosing did not commence until after implantation, the statistically 
significant reduction in the mean number of implantations cannot be attributed to Filsuvez. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 26/162 
 
 
 
 
External malformations were seen in each of the test-article treated groups, however, none were seen 
in the vehicle treated group. The applicant has suggested that these were not test-item related and 
has justified the statement with historical control data for similar findings for the test site.  
In addition, it was noted that in the DRF study both Cmax and AUC increased with dose which 
contrasted significantly with the definitive study where exposure at the 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg dose 
levels were very similar. The applicant clarified that the apparent increase in exposure for the 100 
mg/kg dose group in the DRF study was likely the result of significantly higher exposures measured in 
a single female. The exposure of the other females in this dose group were comparable to that of the 
definitive study.  
Only an EFD in a single species has been performed. The applicant concluded that based on a 
tolerability study in rabbits (Study ZDA0007) there was negligible exposure to Betulin in rabbits. Whilst 
the provided study report did suggest that Betulin levels were below the LLOQ (50 ng/ml) there were 
measured levels of up 225 ng/ml. The study was non-GLP and no formulation or homogenicity analysis 
has been performed. Considering these limitations, the low number of animals used, limited sample 
collection as well as issue with the viscosity of the formulation, the applicant was requested to justify 
the assumption of no exposure in rabbits following oral administration.  
The applicant emphasised that only 3 out of 48 samples from the two groups exposed to the birch bark 
extract gave concentrations of betulin above the lower limit of quantification (<50 ng/mL). Appropriate 
measures appeared to have been taken to insure homogeneity. Other routes of administration are 
unlikely to provide systemic exposure in rabbits. Taken in the context of the low systemic exposure 
levels measured clinically, the lack of an EFD in a second species was acceptable by the CHMP. 
A PPND study did not identify any effects on either the F0 or F1 generation at any dose level up to 100 
mg/kg/day. The analysis of the F1 generation included a full assessment of reproductive function which 
did not find any differences amongst treatment groups. No toxicokinetics were performed and 
therefore no information is available as to the transfer of TE into the breast milk and the subsequent 
exposure of pups in the post-natal period. 
Juvenile animals 
A definitive juvenile animal study was performed in rats in which pups were dosed orally from Day 10 
up to Day 63 via oral gavage. The age of the pups at the start of dosing was generally supportive of a 
patient population from birth. In general, the TE was well tolerated. Relevant endpoints for a paediatric 
population included long bone growth, developmental milestones and neuro-functional behaviour 
assessment, all of which did not detect any test article related adverse events. Furthermore, the 
mating and pregnancy sub-group analysis did not detect any differences. The NOAEL was the top dose 
of 300 mg/kg/day. 
Exposure to Betulin on Day 10 was higher than on Day 63. The reason for this is unclear, however, the 
rat GI tract is known to be immature for the first 2 weeks of life and after this period undergoes 
significant development especially around weaning (Downes, 2017). Given the variability seen in the 
measured samples, it is likely that the higher exposure seen on Day 10 is related to higher levels of 
absorption from the GI tract in rats at this age. Considering the clinical route of application is dermal it 
is possible that the absorption via this route may differ in paediatrics. However, the skin barrier 
function is generally mature at birth in term of neonates. Furthermore, even in the instance that 
absorption was higher in neonates, the lack of toxicity noted in the oral juvenile animal study did 
provide some assurance.

2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
TE showed no sensitising properties in the maximisation test in guinea pigs. In addition, Oleogel-S10 
was not irritant or corrosive to bovine eyes. In the 39-week minipig repeat-dose toxicity study, several 
local findings were observed at the application site following dermal administration, including 
alterations in the epidermis, dermis and subcutis. However, the incidence and/or severity of these 
findings were comparable to the vehicle control. 
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
TE did not show phototoxic properties in the 3T3 NRU in vitro phototoxicity assay. Photosensitisation 
was studied in guinea-pigs and the skin reactions erythema, eschar and edema formation were 
evaluated. In this study, TE revealed no photosensitising properties. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Filsuvez contains triterpenes as dry extract, refined, derived from Betulae cortex (birch bark) and 
sunflower oil, refined. These components are considered unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment. In accordance with the document “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), ERA studies were not 
submitted.  
2.5.6.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology programme provided was very similar to the one that was used to support the 
Episalvan MAA. While the precise mechanism of action is unknown, the programme was considered 
sufficient to support the present application.  
The toxicology programme has revealed that Oleogel-S10 has the ability to cause local reactions, at 
the site of administration. Despite a measurable systemic distribution, the reactions seen after dermal 
administration to minipigs were confined to the direct surrounding of the administration site. 
The possibility that Oleogel-S10 exerts a direct effect on cell differentiation and/or proliferation, i.e., 
has an underlying potential local carcinogenic action, remains a concern. Nevertheless, based on the 
presented data, the risk that Filsuvez would cause malignancies is considered small. A number of 
precautions and follow up measures are enforced and/or planned from the clinical point of view. These 
include a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC, a follow-up Questionnaire for Skin Malignancies and a 
registry-based study as routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities, respectively, to monitor 
the risk of SCC (including other skin malignancies). Therefore, the issue was not pursued further from 
a non-clinical perspective. 
Animal studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. 
No effects during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to Filsuvez is negligible. Filsuvez 
can therefore be used during pregnancy. Further, no effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are 
anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breastfeeding woman to Filsuvez is negligible. Filsuvez 
can therefore be used during breast feeding, unless the chest area is subject to treatment. No adverse 
effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats administered birch bark extract. No effects 
on human fertility are anticipated, since the systemic exposure is negligible (SmPC sections 4.6 and 
5.3).

The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, it is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
In conclusion, the application for Filsuvez in the treatment of patients with EB is considered approvable 
from the non-clinical point of view.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Oleogel-S10 is a sterile and stable gel for topical use.  
The indication initially sought was treatment to achieve accelerated healing of wounds associated with 
dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in patients from birth onwards. See section 2.6.6. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy for final indication granted by the CHMP.  
The gel should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of approximately 1 mm and covered by 
a sterile non-adhesive wound dressing or applied to the dressing so that the gel is in direct contact 
with the wound. The gel should not be applied sparingly. It should not be rubbed in. The gel should be 
reapplied at each wound dressing change. The maximum total wound area treated in the pivotal EB 
clinical study was 5,300 cm2 with a median total wound area of 735 cm2. 
The following in vitro studies for betulin, which is the main component of the extract, were included in 
this submission: 
- 
Protein Binding (Study No. G A VIT-20-051) 
-  Caco-2 Transporter Study (Study No. G-A-VIT-20-032) 
- 
In vitro Metabolic Profile of Betulin in Hepatocytes (Study No. G-A-VIT-19-050) 
-  Cytochrome P450 Reaction Phenotyping Using Recombinant Human CYP Enzymes (Study No. 
G-A-VIT-19-059) 
-  Cytochrome P450 Phenotyping by Chemical Enzyme Inhibition in Cryopreserved Human 
Hepatocytes (Study No. G-A-VIT-19-060) 
-  Betulin as Direct, Time-Dependent, and Metabolism-Dependent Inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 
Isoenzymes in Human Liver Microsomes (Study No. G-A-VIT-19-057) 
-  Betulin as an Inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5 Isoenzymes in Cultured Human 
Hepatocytes (Study No. G-A-VIT-19-058). 
PK samples were taken in the phase 3 BEB-13 study in patients with EB (dried blood spots and venous 
blood), which was conducted using the final Oleogel-S10 formulation (see Table 2). The Phase 2 
clinical study BEB-10 (in EB) and studies in healthy subjects with control gel AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B 
did not contain PK data.  
Oleogel-S10 was approved under the trade name Episalvan on 14 January 2016 in the European Union 
(EU/1/15/1069) for the “treatment of partial-thickness wounds in adults” after having demonstrated 
efficacy and safety in split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site wounds and in Grade 2a burn 
wounds. The Episalvan submission was supported by PK data from clinical studies BSH-12, BSG-12, 
and BBW-11 and the corresponding bioanalysis. No in vitro PK was included in the Episalvan 
submission.  
Methods 
Plasma or whole blood concentrations of betulin were determined with two validated LC/MS/MS 
methods. No cross validation was performed, as the matrices differ.  
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 35/162 
 
 
 
 
 
Method N-A-BIO-12-047 (plasma) was used for samples from clinical studies BSH-12, BSG-12, and 
BBW-11 in subjects with Split-Thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites and Burn Wounds. 
Due to the fragile skin of the EB population, as well as the difficulty in taking venous blood draws from 
children and infants, a less invasive, dried blood spot analytical technique using capillary blood samples 
(finger or heel prick) was developed to measure Betulin whole blood concentrations. The bioanalysis 
method with dried blood spots (DBS) (N-A-BIO-16-100_E01) was used for samples from the phase 3 
study in EB patients (BEB-13), both for capillary and venous blood samples.  
PK parameters were not calculated in this application.  
Absorption  
High permeability of betulin was demonstrated in a pilot Caco-2 study.  
In three clinical studies in subjects with Split-Thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites and Burn Wounds, 
plasma sampling was performed before treatment and at certain timepoints during treatment, to 
measure the systemic concentration of betulin. In studies BSH-12 and BSG-12, sampling was 
performed on days 0, 7, 14, 21 ,28 and at end of treatment, in study BBW-11, on days 0, 7, 14 and at 
end of treatment. Of the 929 plasma samples, 37 (4%) had quantifiable betulin concentrations, 14 of 
these were pre-dose samples and 23 during the treatment period. The betulin concentrations ranged 
from 1.1 to 43.9 ng/ml (predose) and from 1.1 to 68.6 ng/ml (treatment). 
Betulin occurs naturally and is present in olives and some fruits. Therefore, dietary uptake of Betulin 
cannot be excluded and it is likely that the low concentrations observed in the pre-dose samples (and 
possibly in later samples) stemmed from food containing Betulin consumed by the subjects.  
Distribution 
The unbound fractions of betulin in plasma (fu,p) could not be determined as betulin concentrations in 
buffer compartments were below LLOQ. This indicates that the fu,p of betulin is below 0.1% and 
fraction bound (fb,p) is >99.9% in human, rat and minipig plasma.  
No in vivo distribution studies have been conducted. 
Elimination 
No in vivo elimination studies have been conducted. 
In total, structures of six metabolites (M1-M6) were identified from incubation with hepatocytes (Figure 
3). In humans, only four were observed: M2-M5. M2, formed by oxygenation, methylation, and 
sulfation, was the most abundant (26.9%), followed by M4 (sulfation, 19.0% abundance), M5 
(glucuronidation, 12.0% abundance), and M3 (sulfation, 10.2% abundance). Metabolism was virtually 
complete after 5h.

Figure 3. Proposed In Vitro Metabolic Pathways of Betulin in Human Hepatocytes and Indication of their 
occurrence in Non-clinical Species 
Based on the CLint values determined for the individual CYP isoforms using recombinant enzymes and 
considering their abundance in the human (Caucasian) liver, the relative contribution of rhCYP3A5, 
3A4, 2C8, and 2C19 to the overall CYP-mediated metabolism of betulin was calculated to be roughly 
60%, 40%, 0.3%, and 0.07%, respectively. 
The CYP contribution was confirmed in vitro using specific inhibitors. CYP3A contributed most of the 
CYP-mediated pathway, while contributions of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 to the metabolism of Betulin were 
negligible. However, non-CYP enzymes were found to play the predominant role in the hepatic 
metabolism of Betulin, most likely phase II conjugation enzymes. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
PK in target population 
In the Phase 3 BEB-13 study, Oleogel-S10 or the control gel were applied topically at approximately 1 
mm thickness to the EB target wound and to all areas on the subject’s body that were affected by EB 
partial-thickness wounds. Wound areas were then covered with a standard of care non-adhesive 
wound dressing. This procedure was repeated during all dressing changes (at least every 4 days). 
Periodic blood samples were obtained to assess the potential systemic exposure of Betulin following 
topical administration of Oleogel-S10. The majority of patients were not fasting at the timepoint of PK 
sampling. Betulin systemic exposure results for the capillary DBS samples obtained by finger or heel 
stick, if consent was obtained, were obtained for Day 0, 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 90 and CCC (confirmation of 
complete closure of target wound) visit.  
Due to lack of subject consent to capillary blood sampling sticks, the protocol was amended in Version 
4.0 to allow venous DBS sampling and Betulin assays on Days 0 and 90 and Month 24 using the safety 
laboratory venous samples. These microsamples were directly obtained from EDTA-whole blood 
samples, avoiding the need for additional finger pricks. Aliquots from these samples were subsequently 
applied to the collection cards and submitted for analysis. 
Assessment report

Baseline samples were in the range 0-122 ng/ml which could be due to the intake of food or natural 
substances containing Betulin. A similar range is seen in samples from control gel-treated patients in 
both capillary and venous samples.  
Of the post-dose capillary blood samples, 2/43 (5%) were <LLOQ in the Oleogel-S10 arm and 61/63 
(97%) in the control gel arm. For post-dose venous blood samples 57/69 (82%) were <LLOQ in the 
Oleogel-S10 arm, and 106/111 (95%) in the control gel arm. Data per sampling type and treatment is 
summarised in Table 2.  
Several capillary samples resulted in unexplained high concentrations of Betulin, with capillary samples 
at several time points with values above 1000 ng/ml and 4 subjects had systemic exposure values 
above 2000 ng/ml. The reason for these elevated capillary Betulin blood values is ultimately unknown, 
although the applicant considered it was likely that sample contamination from Oleogel-S10 at the site 
of the finger stick process may have contributed to these high concentrations.

Figure 4 illustrates betulin concentration per sample type and total wound area. 
As a basis for comparison and interpretation, several subjects had both capillary and venous sample 
values on Betulin treatment. One subject had elevated capillary results at Day 7 (1190 ng/ml), Day 14 
(298 ng/ml), and Day 60 (458 ng/ml), but his open-label phase Month 24 venous blood DBS sample 
value was 16 ng/ml, reflecting long-term, steady-state treatment and low systemic Betulin exposure 
with Oleogel-S10. Another subject had elevated capillary results at Day 14 (8890 ng/ml) and Day 45 
(368 ng/ml), but at Day 90, his venous Betulin concentration was 36 ng/ml. Finally, a subject had 
elevated capillary results at Day 14 (4030 ng/ml), Day 30 (1110 ng/ml), and at the time of his wound 
closure (2670 ng/ml), but the Day 90 venous concentration was below the LLOQ. These data suggest 
that the higher capillary Betulin concentrations may be falsely elevated due to contamination of the 
sampling process from topical Betulin and that the venous concentrations may be a more accurate 
representation of the Betulin systemic exposure. The highest venous blood concentration of betulin 
was 207 ng/mL.

Betulin did not induce the mRNA expression of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 at physiologically relevant 
levels.  
The effect of betulin on drug transporters was not studied.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The highest systemic concentration measured in EB patients was 207 ng/mL. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The application for Filsuvez contained no dedicated studies to support the proposed mechanism of 
action to achieve accelerated wound healing in patients with EB. Published references supporting 
beneficial effects of triterpenes on wound healing in general have been submitted and are briefly 
summarised below. 
Oleogel-S10 contains triterpenes from birch bark, namely Betulin, Betulinic acid, and Oleanolic acid, 
which have been shown to have antibacterial, antiviral, antimycotic, and anti-inflammatory effects 
([Alakurtti 2006], [Lee 2006], [Suksamrarn 2006]). Oleogel-S10 has been developed to meet the need 
for an effective treatment for wounds associated with EB by accelerating wound healing. 
In EB, the structural integrity of the skin is compromised. Depending on the EB subtype and variant, 
different proteins are defective or missing. However, the various gene mutations that cause EB are not 
thought to impede the molecular pathways to skin re-epithelialisation and keratinocyte migration, 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 41/162 
 
 
 
 
 
which are stimulated by birch bark extract, the active component of Oleogel-S10 ([Ebeling 2014]). As 
all subtypes of EB are associated with partial-thickness wounds which heal by the same process of re-
epithelialisation (driven by keratinocyte migration, differentiation, etc.), the applicant considered that 
they share the same wound healing pathway. Further, the applicant was of the view that Oleogel-S10 
accelerates wound closure by exerting effects on different wound healing phases. In vitro tests with 
human primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts and ex vivo studies with porcine skin showed that birch 
bark extract modulate immune inflammatory mediators including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2), 
interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and RANTES (regulated 
upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted), all key players in the inflammation 
phase in wound healing ([Ebeling 2014]; [Wardecki 2016]) and associated with activation of 
intracellular pathways known to be involved in keratinocyte differentiation [Wölfle 2010] and migration 
[Ebeling 2014].  
Formation of a new skin barrier involves cellular proliferation, migration, adhesion, deposition of 
matrix, and keratinocyte differentiation. Birch bark extract support the differentiation of keratinocytes 
by upregulating the expression of differentiation markers keratin, type I cytoskeletal 10 (KRT 10) and 
involucrin (INV), and the adhesion protein transglutaminase in human keratinocytes. KRT 10 
expression induced by birch bark extract depends on an up-regulation and an indirect activation of 
TRPC6 by high [Ca2+]ex (see [Wölfle 2010]). Furthermore, birch bark extract influence the 
cytoskeleton, in particular via induction of filopodia and lamellipodia mediated by an activation of the 
Rho GTPase RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A) (see [Ebeling 2014] and [Wardecki 2016]).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Since no specific pharmacodynamic studies (ex vivo or in vivo) in EB patients have been performed, 
the postulated beneficial effects rely on the assumption that wound healing processes are similar in 
skin of healthy, non-EB subjects and EB patients according to the applicant. The mechanism of action 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 42/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is thus more of a general support to achieve a faster wound healing rather than a specific mechanism 
of action targeting specific EB sub-types.  
There were no secondary pharmacology studies submitted in this application, for instance a thorough 
QT study (see Safety section). 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
With respect to pharmacodynamic interactions, the product is locally applied and locally acting. Hence, 
systemic drug-drug interactions are not expected. The proposed SmPC states that interactions with 
topical products have not been investigated in clinical trials and that other topical products should not 
be concomitantly used together with Filsuvez but rather sequentially or alternatively depending on the 
clinical need.  
No dedicated studies have been performed to evaluate genetic differences in PD response. The 
potential differences between different EB sub-types (e.g. DDEB, RDED, JEB) in clinical response is 
discussed in the efficacy sections below. 
No analyses on the relationship between plasma concentration and effect have been presented. The 
effect is local; hence, exposure-response and PK/PD have low relevance for this application, unless 
potentially for evaluation of exposure-safety relationships. However, no AEs suggestive of systemic 
actions of betulin (or related components) were observed in the clinical safety data. Betulin levels above 
70 ng/mL in the DBP of BEB-13 were reviewed to determine if there was any suggestion of an 
associated safety signal within 4 weeks of the elevated venous or capillary betulin value. No robust 
relation between systemic exposure of betulin and AE could be established. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As this is a known active substance 8(3)/12(3) application, full documentation is required. In 
consequence, the data from the Episalvan submission (clinical studies BSH-12, BSG-12, and BBW-11 
and the corresponding bioanalysis) has also been submitted. The assessment of this data is in line with 
the original assessment (EMEA/H/C/3938) and is reflected in the respective sections.  
In Episalvan, as only low and sporadic levels of betulin were found in plasma, it was concluded that the 
systemic absorption was minimal, and thus it was accepted that no further study on the elimination, 
special populations or drug-drug interactions was performed. 
The in vitro PK data is new to this submission, as well as the bioanalytical assay using dried blood 
spots, which was used to analyse samples from the phase 3 study BEB-13 in the EB population. 
Further differences between the submissions are linked to the indication, with Filsuvez seeking an 
indication in EB patients from 6 months of age (Episalvan is approved in adults only). Inherent to the 
type of wound, larger wounds and chronic administration are expected in EB patients.  
Only betulin, the main component of the betulae cortex dry extract, was studied, which is in line with 
the received advice (Q7, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/865922/2011). 
Methods 
In general, method N-A-BIO-12-047 (plasma) was satisfactorily validated, and within-run performance 
appeared acceptable.  
Method N-A-BIO-16-100_E01 (DBS) was satisfactorily validated, and within-run performance appeared 
acceptable. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was however not performed. Samples from venous blood 
in study BEB-13 had similar levels as in plasma samples from study BSH-12, BSG-12 and BBW-11 (up 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 43/162 
 
 
 
 
to 68.6 ng/mL). Considering the small number of quantifiable results; the lack of ISR is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
As the value of capillary blood samples was strongly diminished by contamination issues (see below), 
the CHMP considered that there was no need for ISR for those samples.  
Absorption 
No formal PK study was conducted. Occasional samples with measurable concentrations of betulin were 
found both pre- and post-dose, and all reported positive samples and had betulin levels in the range 1-
70 ng/ml. The applicant pointed out that some common nutrients such as lingonberries, olives and 
apples contain betulin, and speculated that they could be a source of measurable betulin plasma levels. 
The LLOQ 1 ng/ml is believed to be high enough to identify biologically active drug levels. The 
applicant´s conclusion that the betulin plasma levels resulting from topical treatment of Oleogel-S10 
were not higher than natural background levels originating from e.g. nutritional sources, is overall 
endorsed. No conclusion can be drawn on variability as this is confounded by the intake of betulin 
containing food.  
Apart from betulin, Oleogel-S10 contains also other minor components such as betulinic acid, lupeol, 
oleanolic acid, and erythrodiol. Betulin is however the main component, all other components are 
present in substantially lower concentrations, and bioanalysis of betulin only is thus accepted by the 
CHMP.  
As only low and sporadic betulin plasma levels were found, it can be concluded that the systemic 
absorption of betulin was minimal (SmPC section 5.2). 
Distribution 
The unbound fractions of Betulin in plasma (fu,p) could not be determined in any species as Betulin 
concentrations in buffer compartments were below the LLOQ of 1 nM. The conclusions that the fu,p of 
Betulin is below 0.1% and the fraction bound is >99.9% in plasma for all three species tested is 
agreed and in line with SmPC section 5.2. 
Elimination 
The lack of in vivo studies is acceptable for a LALA product. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC 
section 5.2. 
Metabolism 
The extent of Betulin metabolism was practically complete in all species (after 5 h incubation with 
hepatocytes) where 4 metabolites were identified in human. No human specific metabolites were 
identified.  
PK in target population 
In Q5 of the scientific advice received (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/97017/2017), concern was expressed 
regarding the treatment of larger body surface areas in EB and the length of use, and the importance 
of identifying the extent of betulin absorption. The sampling strategy, including a new sampling 
method with dried blood spots was supported to increase the consent to PK sampling. These aspects 
were adequately addressed by the applicant.  
A different picture of systemic betulin exposure upon treatment with Oleogel-S10 was provided 
depending on the sampling type. The majority (82%) of the on-treatment venous samples were less 
than the lower limit of quantification (i.e., 10 ng/ml). The systemic exposure (up to 207 ng/mL post-
dose, 27 ng/mL pre-dose) was generally relatively similar to what was seen in other indications where 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 44/162 
 
 
 
 
up to 68.6 ng/mL was measured. This is also in the range that can be expected upon consumption of 
betulin containing food. This has been adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.2.  
When considering capillary blood samples however, significantly higher betulin concentrations were 
measured. Should this finding be true, then a correlation with the total wound area, as a surrogate for 
the administered dose, would be expected, both for venous and capillary blood samples. This was not 
the case. The applicant considered the elevated levels in capillary samples likely to be due to 
contaminations at the site of sampling. No detailed information was given in the study protocol on how 
to take the capillary sample, which may have been helpful to avoid such contaminations. The 
explanation for high concentrations as the result of contaminations is nevertheless accepted. This is 
further supported by a few subjects with both venous and capillary blood sampling, where the elevated 
levels are only present in capillary samples. Thus, it is acceptable to base the overall assessment of PK 
and the SmPC information on data from venous samples. As only low and sporadic betulin plasma 
levels were found, it can be concluded that the systemic absorption of betulin was minimal. No further 
in vivo studies on the elimination of betulin or special populations were performed. This is acceptable 
to the CHMP. 
Overall, the results indicate low Betulin systemic exposure following topical administration of Oleogel-
S10 to partial thickness wounds in the majority of patients with EB. The findings are reasonably 
consistent with 3 previous studies of Oleogel-S10 in non-EB partial-thickness wounds (BSH-12, BSG-12 
and BBW-11). However, overall, the systemic absorption of Betulin appeared to be slightly higher in 
patients with EB compared to patients with non-EB wounds. The applicant considered that these 
differences may be due to difference in skin permeability in the patient populations, more widespread 
areas for drug treatment, and therefore a larger surface area as compared to the body size of the EB 
patients, who are generally younger. Any differences in systemic absorption in the various patient 
populations were modest and were not suggestive of systemic adverse events. The explanation was 
acknowledged by the CHMP. 
Special populations 
The absence of study in special populations is acceptable, given the low systemic exposure. This is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC, with no dose adjustment being required for patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment. 
Analyses of betulin exposure per body mass index and age did not indicate the need for dose 
adjustment, in line with the expected low exposure for a LALA medicinal product. Gender and race 
were not addressed by the applicant, but similarly low exposures are expected across genders and 
races. No dose adjustments are required.  
The CHMP SAWP considered the skin to be a relatively mature organ at birth and that it can be 
assumed that percutaneous translocation of compound in the blood will be similar in neonates, children 
and adults.  
Interactions 
DDI cut-offs are only relevant for systemic betulin concentration since this drug product is locally 
applied to the skin. In the present application, no Cmax can be defined, as most samples were taken 
before changing wound dressing and thus may be considered as Ctrough. In most cases, systemic 
concentrations of Betulin were <LOQ, which was similar to what was previously observed in subjects 
with Split-Thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites and Burn Wounds, and where the lack of drug interaction 
studies was accepted. Further, no correlation was observed between exposure and total wound area, 
BMI or age, which supports the extrapolation of PK from already authorised indications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 45/162 
 
 
 
 
In vitro studies did not indicate clinically relevant signals for inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes. 
Interactions (both as victim or perpetrator) with drug transporters were not studied, which the 
applicant considered justified by the minimal systemic exposure of betulin. This view is agreed, and 
this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacodynamic studies (ex vivo or in vivo) in EB patients have been performed to 
support a positive effect of Oleogel-S10 in the acceleration of wound healing in EB skin. The postulated 
beneficial effects rely on the assumption that wound healing processes are similar in skin of healthy, 
non-EB subjects and EB patients. The mechanism of action is thus more of a general support to 
achieve a faster wound healing rather than a specific mechanism of action targeting specific EB sub-
types. The effect is local; hence, exposure-response and PK/PD have low relevance for this application, 
unless potentially for evaluation of exposure-safety relationships. The exposure/safety analysis was 
performed regardless of blood sample type and may thus be biased by contaminations for the 
measurements from capillary blood samples. It is however agreed that no correlation between betulin 
levels and AE was apparent. No AEs suggestive of systemic actions of betulin (or related components) 
were observed in the clinical safety data.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Limited PK data on the marker substance betulin is available, indicating low systemic exposure. Since 
Oleogel-S10 is a locally applied, locally acting medicinal product, the extent of data is considered to be 
acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies are included in the application. Since the effect is local, PK/PD modelling is 
not applicable. One small Phase 2 study has been performed (Study BEB-10) but no dose finding was 
included in this study. It is described below (Supportive studies).  
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
This application contains one pivotal phase 3 study; BEB-13. 
Study BEB-13 (EASE study) 
Study BEB-13 is a randomised, controlled, 90-day double-blind phase 3 study, with a 24-month open-
label follow-up of Oleogel-S10 in subjects with inherited EB. Each subject was to participate for 90 
days in the randomised double-blind phase (DBP). At the end of the DBP (Day 90), subjects in both 
treatment arms were invited to enter the single-arm open-label phase (OLP) with Oleogel-S10 
treatment of all wounds for 24 months. The total duration of study participation (DBP and OLP) was 
planned to be approximately 27 months. 
The final results for the DBP of the study were submitted as well as the preliminary safety data for 
subjects who entered the OLP and had data at the time of an OLP data cut-off (11 June 2020). Further 
efficacy and safety data from the OLP will be submitted once available (i.e., by Q1 2023).

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
o  Male and female subjects aged ≥4 years with the following subtypes of inherited EB: DEB, JEB, 
and Kindler syndrome (the EBS subtype was removed from the eligibility criteria in Protocol 
Version 4.0) 
Note: Children ≥21 days old and <4 years could be included, but only after confirmation by the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) upon review of the safety and bioanalytical 
(betulin) data at the interim safety review 
o  Subjects with an EB target wound (i.e., EB partial-thickness wound of 10 cm2 to 50 cm2 in size, 
aged ≥21 days and <9 months) outside of the anogenital region (specification of outside the 
anogenital region clarified in Protocol Version 6.0) 
o  Subject and/or his/her legal representative was informed, read, and understood the subject 
information/ICF, and gave written informed consent 
o  Subject and/or his/her legal representative had to be able and willing to follow study procedures 
and instructions. 
Exclusion criteria 
o  Subject had EB subtype EBS (added in Protocol Version 4.0) 
o  EB target wound that was ≥9 months old (added in Protocol Version 4.0) or had clinical signs of 
local infection 
o  Use of systemic antibiotics for wound-related infections within 7 days prior to enrolment 
o  Administration of systemic or topical steroids (except for inhaled, ophthalmic, or topical 
applications, such as budesonide suspension for esophageal strictures [e.g., Pulmicort Respules 
0.25 mg/2 ml or 0.5 mg/2 ml]) within 30 days before enrolment 
o 
Immunosuppressive therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy within 60 days prior to enrolment 
o  Subject had undergone stem cell transplant or gene therapy for the treatment of inherited EB 
o  Current and/or former malignancy including basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas 
(SCCs) 
o  Enrollment in any interventional study or treated with any investigational drug for any disease 
within 4 weeks prior to study entry 
o  Factors present in the subject and/or his/her legal representative that could have interfered with 
study compliance such as inability to attend scheduled study visits or compliance with home 
dressing changes 
o  Pregnant or nursing women 
o  Women of childbearing potential, including post-menarchal female adolescents, and men 
(reference to men added in Protocol Version 4.0) who were not willing to use an effective form of 
birth control with failure rates <1% per year (e.g., implant, injectable, combined oral 
contraceptive, intra-uterine contraceptive device, sexual abstinence, vasectomy or vasectomized

partner) during participation in the study (and at least 3 months thereafter) 
o  Subject was a member of the investigational team or his/her immediate family 
o  Subject lived in the same household as a study participant. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are broadly found acceptable, with some comments.  
Following a protocol amendment, patients with the EB subtype EBS (EB Simplex) were not to be 
included. The reason for this change was that EBS wounds are generally smaller, more superficial, and 
dynamic in nature. Inclusion of such wounds would likely have increased the rate of healing in the 
control group as determined by the primary endpoint and reduced the statistical power of the primary 
efficacy endpoint comparison. This is acknowledged and the proposed indication wording does not 
include EBS. 
It was not stated in the inclusion criteria how the EB diagnosis should have been confirmed, e.g. if 
genetic testing was needed or if immunofluorescence mapping or electron microscopy or a clinical EB 
diagnosis only would suffice. The applicant was asked to explain and justify the reason for a genetic 
confirmation of EB diagnosis only being optional. This is discussed further below. 
A target wound was defined as having a size 10 cm2 to 50 cm2, aged ≥21 days but less than 9 months, 
and should be present outside of the anogenital region. This is endorsed. Following discussions in the 
Protocol assistance in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III), an upper size limit of 50 cm2 
was set. The target wound should not have clinical signs of local infection. An upper age limit of 9 
months for the target wound was included following an amendment. 
The study had broad age inclusion criteria; subjects from the age of 21 days could be included. The 
inclusion of children below 4 years of age was only made after confirmation by the IDMC upon review 
of the safety and bioanalytical (betulin) data at the interim safety review. This approach is reasonable, 
and the inclusion of children and infants is relevant due to the unmet need also in this group of EB 
patients.

Figure 6. Study Design 
Double-Blind Phase 
The randomised DBP consisted of 3 periods: 
1. Screening (up to 28 days prior to baseline) 
Study sites invited subjects from site-specific databases for screening. Subjects who failed screening 
could be rescreened if they later became eligible, as deemed appropriate by the investigator. 
2. Baseline, enrolment, and stratified randomisation (Day 0) 
The investigator confirmed eligibility for the subject on Day 0 and, providing the subject was eligible, 
enrolled the subject into the study. There was a baseline assessment of demography and medical 
history, and the EB target wound was selected based on the Investigator’s Worksheet. According to 
this worksheet, the wound with the largest size, maximum depth and longest duration should be 
chosen as the target wound. Subjects were stratified according to their EB subtype and target wound 
size (cm2) into the following groups: DEB 10 to <20; DEB 20 to <30; DEB 30 to 50; JEB/Kindler 10 to 
<20; JEB/Kindler 20 to <30; and JEB/Kindler 30 to 50. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either 
Oleogel-S10 or control gel. 
3. Intervention (90 days) 
The EB partial-thickness target wound and all areas on a subject’s body that were affected by EB 
partial-thickness wounds were treated with Oleogel-S10 and standard of care non-adhesive wound 
dressing or with control gel and standard of care non-adhesive wound dressing. The randomised 
treatment was to be applied during all dressing changes (at least every 4 days) until the end of DBP 
(EDBP). Each subject participated for 90 days in the DBP of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 49/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oleogel-S10 or the control gel were applied topically at approximately 1 mm (0.04 inch) thickness to 
the EB target wound and to all areas on the subject’s body that were affected by EB partial thickness 
wounds. The subject (or caregiver) could apply study medication directly to the wound or on to the 
wound dressing used to cover the wound, based on personal preference. The subject was permitted to 
keep their usual schedule of wound dressing changes as long as dressing changes and study 
medication application took place at least every 4 days. The subject was asked to maintain a regular 
schedule of wound dressing changes (i.e., not to change intervals) and to report this schedule to the 
investigator at each clinic visit. 
The study medication was not to be rubbed into the wounds or mixed with other skin products at the 
time of application. If a wound was closed, it was not necessary to continue to apply study medication. 
The subject could use wound dressing on the closed wound to protect the area, if desired. Areas on the 
subject’s body that were not affected by EB partial-thickness wounds were not to be treated with study 
medication. The study medication was not intended for use on full-thickness wounds. 
During the 90-day DBP, there was a Site Visit or Home Visit at Day 7 (±2 days; could also have been a 
phone call instead of a site or home visit) and Site visits at Day 14 (±5 days), Day 30 (±7 days), Day 
45 (±7 days), Day 60 (±7 days) and Day 90 (±7 days). At the Day 14 and Day 45 visits, the 
investigator could visit the subject at home.  
After first clinical assessment of complete closure of the EB target wound (based on clinical assessment 
by an investigator at a scheduled visit), a site study team member (e.g., study nurse) visited the 
patient at home 7 days (+2 days) for confirmation of complete closure (CCC) of the EB target wound. 
Alternatively, the patient visited the site 7 days (+2 days) after first clinical assessment of complete 
closure of the EB target wound for CCC. The target wound was photo-documented with the ARANZ 
Silhouette system. Photographs were reviewed by the investigator. Wound dressings were to be 
changed, and the study medication continued to be applied to any remaining EB wounds matching 
target wound criteria. It was not necessary to continue to apply study medication to the closed wound. 
Oleogel-S10 
Oleogel-S10 contains birch bark extract in a white to almost white powder consisting of approximately 
80% (w/w) betulin and other closely related triterpene compounds. The powder forms a gel when 
mixed with oil in the optimum combination ratio. Oleogel-S10 is a sterile, colourless to slightly 
yellowish, opalescent, non-aqueous gel packed in white collapsible aluminum tubes containing 23.4 g 
of gel each.  
Control Gel 
The sterile control gel matched Oleogel-S10 in texture and visual appearance. The control gel consisted 
of sunflower oil, Cera flava/yellow wax and Carnauba wax.  
Standard of Care Non-adhesive Wound Dressings 
Standard of care non-adhesive wound dressings were defined as modern non-adhesive wound 
dressings or equivalents. The eligibility criteria in this study did not exclude the use of specific wound 
dressings. Subjects were permitted to continue using their standard of care non-adhesive wound 
dressings, with the exception of silver dressings, which were not allowed on EB target wounds or 
additional wounds meeting target wound criteria until complete closure and confirmed epithelialisation. 
This was applicable in both phases of the study. To reduce the diversity of wound dressings, the 
protocol recommended that they be limited to a small number of products such as Mepitel (Mölnlycke 
Health Care AB, Sweden) or PolyMem (Ferris Mfg. Corp., US). For further products, the ‘International 
Consensus Best Practice Guidelines for Skin and Wound Care in Epidermolysis Bullosa’ was referenced.

During the course of the study, it was discovered that some subjects were using Vaseline gauze or 
other dressings containing topical emollients, even though topical emollients were not permitted per 
the protocol (Versions 3.0 through 6.0). The protocol was amended (Version 6.0) to clarify that 
dressings containing topical emollients (e.g., Vaseline gauze) were not allowed. 
The rationale for the requirement to avoid the use of dressings containing topical emollients was 
conservative in nature. As topical emollients may potentially aid wound healing, these were prohibited 
in the original protocol. Although dressings containing emollients are quite different from an actual 
topical application, there is a small amount of emollient that permeates these dressings. 
The investigators were instructed to not change dressings in enrolled subjects, but to avoid using 
“nonpermitted dressings containing topical emollients” in future subjects. In addition, the investigators 
were instructed to report all dressings containing emollients (both prior to implementation of the 
amendment and thereafter) as protocol deviations to allow a subgroup analysis of these subjects. 
Efficacy was evaluated in terms of modern non-adhesive (permitted) versus other (nonpermitted) 
dressings (Prohibited Wound Dressing/Contact Layers). 
Open-Label Phase 
Once the EDBP visit was completed, the subject could enter the single-arm, 24-month OLP.  
Topical Oleogel-S10 was to be administered to all areas on the subject’s body that were affected by EB 
partial-thickness wounds on Day 0 of the OLP. Wound areas were to be covered with standard of care 
non-adhesive wound dressings. This procedure was to be repeated during all dressing changes (at 
least every 4 days) until the end of treatment at Month 24. Subjects participating in the OLP were to 
receive Oleogel-S10 treatment for 24 months.  
The treatments compared in this study are Oleogel-S10 on top of standard of care (non-adhesive 
wound dressing) vs. control gel and standard of care non-adhesive wound dressing. The control gel 
used in this study was not merely the gel vehicle without the active substance (the extract) as would 
be common practise in a controlled study with a topical treatment. Due to the galenical properties, 
with the betulin extract and sunflower oil forming an ‘oleogel’, it was not possible to simply use the gel 
vehicle in this case, i.e. pure sunflower oil (with different viscosity etc. vs the active product). 
Therefore, a dedicated ‘control gel’ was developed and used in the study. This approach was 
extensively discussed in the scientific advice procedures (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III 
and EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/2/2018/PA/SME/II). There was a concern that in case a beneficial effect of 
the active treatment (Oleogel-S10) was observed, sufficient reassurance would be needed to establish 
that this was not merely due to a detrimental effect on wound healing caused by the ‘control gel’. To 
overcome this concern, the applicant conducted studies AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B (See below, 
supportive studies). 
Oleogel-S10 or the control gel were to be applied on the EB target wound and also to all areas on the 
subject’s body that were affected by EB partial-thickness wounds. It did not appear as if a maximum 
body surface area to be covered was specified in the protocol.  
The attempts to standardise the type of wound dressings to be used, to the extent possible in a global 
study, is acknowledged. However, some subjects still used Vaseline gauze or other dressings 
containing topical emollients, although these were not permitted per the protocol (Versions 3.0 
through 6.0). A subgroup analysis of these subjects was performed and is discussed below. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of the DBP was to compare the efficacy of Oleogel-S10 with vehicle (referred to 
as control gel) in the promotion of healing of EB partial-thickness wounds. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 51/162 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives of the DBP were to compare the efficacy of Oleogel-S10 with control gel based on 
several different evaluations (please refer to secondary endpoints described below), to compare the 
safety of Oleogel-S10 with control gel (based on the incidence, severity and relatedness of AEs, and 
laboratory assessments), to compare the tolerability of Oleogel-S10 with control gel and to assess 
betulin exposure. 
Two objectives of the 24-month OLP were addressed in the evaluation of the interim OLP data; to 
evaluate the safety of Oleogel-S10 based on the incidence, severity and relatedness of AEs, and 
laboratory assessments and to evaluate local tolerability of Oleogel-S10. 
The study objectives are considered adequate. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the DBP was the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of 
the EB target wound (defined as EB partial-thickness wound of 10 cm2 to 50 cm2 in size and ≥21 days 
to <9 months in age) in subjects with inherited EB (subtypes DEB, JEB, or Kindler syndrome) within 45 
days of treatment with Oleogel-S10 compared with control gel based on clinical assessment by the 
investigator (the wound was to be rated as “closed” at first appearance of complete re-epithelialisation 
without drainage). 
The choice of this endpoint was discussed and agreed in the CHMP protocol assistance in 2017 
(EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III). Assessing the proportion of patients achieving wound 
closure within a period of 45 days, rather than time to first wound closure within 90 days was found 
acceptable. Also, the time point 45 days was preferred to the initially proposed 60 days.  
The target EB wound was defined as an EB partial-thickness wound of 10 cm2 to 50 cm2 in size and 
≥21 days to <9 months in age. This definition provides reassurance that the wound has not healed for 
a period of 3 weeks, while still not being a chronic wound aged more than 9 months. A wound size of 
10-50 cm2 is deemed relevant. The definition is considered adequate and in agreement with what was 
discussed in the CHMP PA in 2017.  
First complete closure of the EB target wound was based on clinical assessment by the investigator and 
the wound was rated as “closed” at first appearance of complete re-epithelialisation without drainage. 
This is endorsed. A re-opening of a closed target wound is however also of great interest since EB skin 
is very fragile and a benefit of a healed wound would be larger if the healing is sustained. This was 
discussed in the PA procedure 2017 and it was considered that the incidence of re-injury of the target 
wound should be reported. In the study protocol, it was clarified that confirmation of complete closure 
was assessed by a site study team member (e.g., study nurse) at home 7 days (+2 days) after first 
clinical assessment of complete closure of the EB target wound or the patient could visit the site 7 days 
(+2 days) after first clinical assessment of complete closure of the EB target wound. A requirement for 
sustained healing was not part of the primary endpoint but was assessed in a supportive analysis. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
o  Time to first complete closure of the EB target wound based on clinical assessment until EDBP (Day 
90) 
o  Proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound at Day 90 based on 
clinical assessment by the investigator

age, before wound dressing changes at Day 90 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints of the DBP were: 
o  Change from baseline (DBP Day 0) in “procedural” pain using the FLACC scale [Merkel 1997] in 
subjects <4 years of age and the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale [Wong 2015] in subjects 
≥4 years of age after wound dressing changes at Days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, and 90 
o  Change from baseline (DBP Day 0) in “background” pain using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, 
Consolability (FLACC) pain rating scale [Merkel 1997] in subjects <4 years of age and the Wong-
Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale [Wong 2015] in subjects ≥4 years of age before wound dressing 
changes at Days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, and 90 
o  Proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound at Days 14, 30, and 60 
based on clinical assessment by the investigator 
o  Proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound at Days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 
and 90 based on subject assessment 
o  Proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound at Days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, 
and 90 based on blinded evaluation of photographs 
o  Percentage change from baseline (DBP Day 0) in EB target wound size as evidenced by blinded 
evaluation of photographs taken at Days 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, and 90 
o  Change from baseline (DBP Day 0) in TBWB as evidenced by clinical assessment using Section I 
(assessment of the skin except for the anogenital region) of the EBDASI [Loh 2014] at Days 30 
and 60 
o  Change from baseline (DBP Day 0) in body surface area percentage (BSAP) of TBSA affected by EB 
partial-thickness wounds as evidenced by clinical assessment based on the Lund and Browder chart

Safety endpoints of the DBP were: 
o 
o 
o 
Incidence, severity, and relatedness of AEs 
Local tolerability as judged by the investigator 
Laboratory assessments 
o  Vital signs 
o  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
Exposure to betulin was also assessed. 
Safety endpoints for the 24-month OLP, listed above for the DBP, were evaluated using interim OLP 
data.  
As outlined above, a large number of secondary endpoints have been evaluated, six of them being 
classified as key secondary efficacy endpoints and included in the multiple testing procedure. These 
endpoints reflect other aspects of wound healing, e.g., time to first closure and proportion of subjects 
with first complete closure up to Day 90, the incidence and severity of wound infections between 
baseline and Day 90, change from baseline in total body wound burden (TBWB) based on EBDASI at 
Day 90 and change from baseline in itching. In addition to the key secondary endpoints a range of 
other secondary endpoints were also evaluated, e.g., addressing “procedural” pain and “background” 
pain, evaluating target wound closure at other time points, TBWB, change from baseline in body 
surface area percentage affected by EB partial-thickness wounds and itch. These are relevant efficacy 
endpoints in an EB study. Safety endpoints are also acceptable.  
•  Sample size 
The assumed true control rate for the primary endpoint of first complete closure of the EB target 
wound was 27%. Based on the use of a 2-sided chi-square test of equality of binomial proportions at 
the alpha=0.05 level of significance, a total sample size of 182 subjects (91 subjects per arm) provides 
80% power to detect an improvement of 20 percentage points (i.e., a true Oleogel-S10 rate of 47%). 
A total of 192 subjects were planned to be enrolled into the study and treated to account for a dropout 
rate of 5%, as dropout rates in studies with EB subjects are reported to be small. 
An unblinded interim analysis for sample size re-estimation was conducted by the IDMC on 21 
December 2018 when approximately 50% of subjects had completed Day 45. This analysis involved an 
unblinded sample size re-estimation using the CHW approach and a computation of the conditional 
power to check for futility [Cui 1999].  
Based on the results of the sample size re-estimation, the IDMC recommended that the sample size be 
increased by 48 subjects (24 per arm) for a total of 230 evaluable subjects. 
In the months preceding 06 March 2020, the rate of enrolment into the study had slowed, which 
reflected the low number of subjects with this rare disease. As of 06 March 2020, 223 subjects had 
been randomized to the study. After consultation with an independent expert, the Sponsor concluded 
that the statistical impact of further subject recruitment would most likely be negligible and decided to 
cease enrolment and proceed to database lock of the DBP. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
A 1:1 randomisation to Oleogel-S10 or control gel was used, stratified for EB subtype and size of target 
wound (cm2) in six different strata: DEB 10 to <20; DEB 20 to <30; DEB 30 to 50; JEB/Kindler 10 to 
<20; JEB/Kindler 20 to <30; and JEB/Kindler 30 to 50. Once a randomization number was assigned, 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 54/162 
 
 
 
 
that number could not be used again for any other subject (e.g., if a subject was withdrawn from the 
study, that subject’s randomization number was not reused for any other subject).  
The stratification factors are considered adequate. Other stratification factors discussed during the PA 
procedure were anaemia or nutrition status, as these variables could have a substantial impact on 
wound healing. The applicant argued that adding further strata would not be feasible due to the limited 
patient numbers of each subtype and that the proposed stratification factors were considered most 
relevant prognostic factors. This was understood and agreed, however, sensitivity analyses of further 
possible confounding factors such as wound size, co-morbidities or study centre/regional effects were 
recommended. The CHMP also recommended considering seasonal change (see below).  
Concerning the blinding, during the double-blind period, investigators and subjects were blinded to the 
treatment allocation. An independent unblinded biostatistics team maintained the randomisation 
scheme key in a separate location and was only to distribute this to approved personnel. All 
randomisation materials, including the key, were placed in an unblinded folder with restricted access, 
which remained restricted until after DBP completion and subsequent locking of the study database for 
the DBP. For emergency unblinding, a specific procedure was to be used. 
There was an unblinded interim analysis performed by the unblinded biostatistician and evaluated by 
the IDMC for the purpose of a sample size re-estimation. This information was not shared with the 
Sponsor, the investigators, or any other parties. Details of the unblinded sample size re-estimation 
were described in the SAP. The sample size re-estimation was performed when approximately 50% of 
subjects had completed Day 45. 
There was also an unblinded IDMC review of interim safety and betulin exposure data to confirm if the 
study could be expanded to allow inclusion of children to all ages (i.e., ≥21 days and <4 years). 
The final unblinding of the study did not take place until all subjects completed the DBP of the study, 
all queries were resolved, and the DBP database was locked. 
The control gel used in this study matched Oleogel-S10 in terms of texture and visual appearance to 
allow for double blinding. The packaging for Oleogel-S10 gel and the control gel were identical. 
Adequate procedures and measures seem to have been taken to ensure blinding, to the extent 
possible. As described above, using the pure vehicle (sunflower oil) was not considered possible due to 
different galenic properties, e.g., viscosity, that would have led to unblinding. Nevertheless, the use of 
a different ‘control gel’ can have implications for the interpretation of a difference observed between 
treatment arms. This is discussed further in relation to assessment of the supportive studies AHV-18-A 
and AHV-18-B and in the section Discussion on clinical efficacy.  
In the OLP, all subjects were to be treated with Oleogel-S10 and there was no blinding applied during 
that period. Both the investigator and the subject were aware of the treatment to be received. 
•  Statistical methods 
The study included interim safety reviews (blinded and unblinded), an interim analysis (IA) with 
sample size re-estimation for the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), a final primary 
analysis of the double-blind treatment period and a follow-up analysis of the open-label treatment 
period. The follow-up analysis of the open-label treatment period was not included in the initial 
application. 
Analysis populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised subjects treated at least once with study 
medication. Subjects were analysed according to the randomised treatment regimen. The FAS was 
used as the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 55/162 
 
 
 
 
 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) included all subjects who met the eligibility criteria, received the planned 
study medication, and had reasonably adhered to all relevant protocol conditions. Subjects were 
analysed according to randomised treatment regimen. Supportive analyses of the primary efficacy 
endpoint and key secondary endpoints were conducted using the PPS. 
The Completer Analysis Set (CAS) included all subjects from the FAS who did not discontinue the DBP 
of the study early, irrespective of the reason for discontinuation. Subjects were analysed according to 
the randomised treatment regimen. Supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint and key 
secondary endpoints were conducted using the CAS. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB 
target wound within 45 days of treatment. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was 
performed on the FAS. 
The proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound within 45 days based on 
clinical assessment by the investigator was initially compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test, stratified by EB subtype and target wound size class. The hypothesis was defined in terms 
of the common odds ratio (OR). H0: OR=1 versus H1: OR ≠ 1. 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint considered missing data with regard to wound closures as 
failures. 
The final statistical analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was performed based on the Cui, Hung, 
Wang (CHW) approach to adjust the estimates provided by the CMH test for the sample size re-
estimation.  
The statistical hypotheses were appropriate. The statistical analyses methods using the CMH were also 
appropriate for the type of endpoint. However, there were concerns raised related to the method of 
analysis using the Cui, Hung approach for controlling the type I error as a result of sample size 
reassessment, as outlined below.  
The authors of the cited article report in Table A1 of this article presented simulations that describe the 
impact on the type I error. An approach using simulation is not acceptable to demonstrate type I error 
control as it cannot be guaranteed that the simulation parameters provided in the paper meet exactly 
the conditions of the trial. Table A1 was the ‘old’ method for which type I error was inflated. The ‘new’ 
method did appear to control the type I error. However, simulations are used for Table A2, but it was 
unclear whether the type I error was fixed and then the (conditional) power was computed for varying 
sample sizes (which seems to be the case). The paper stated, “Monte Carlo Simulation was conducted 
to estimate the size and gain in power for the new test”. Table A2 showed the type I error to be 
exactly 0.025 (this could mean ≤0.025), but that was unclear. It is odd that the type I error is the 
same at all information fractions (the chance of a false positive would intuitively seem to be higher 
with a smaller information fraction). The method based on conditional power assumed a linear 
projection of the test statistic at the interim to the final. There was no evidence provided this 
projection was linear – that is, the slope of the projection, if nonlinear, could result in a smaller test 
statistic, and therefore a possible impact on the type I error (Prochan, Lan & Wittes: Statistical 
Monitoring of clinical trials, Springer 1980).  
Therefore, further verification and justification that the type I error was adequately controlled was 
requested. Moreover, given the multiple amendments to the SAP and protocol and lack of guarantee 
that statistical hypotheses were conducted repeatedly, and a data driven approach could have been 
undertaken, the potential for a biased estimate with an increase in the type I error cannot be easily 
dismissed. Consequently, the applicant had not convincingly proven that the type I error control is 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 56/162 
 
 
 
 
below 2.5%. The applicant was requested to analytically prove that the type I error was controlled 
based on the method used and the estimate of the treatment effect is unbiased. In any case, in a 
single pivotal trial, a type I error control should be proven to be well below 2.5%.  
Subgroup analyses were performed on the randomisation stratification subgroups and other relevant 
subgroups specified in the SAP. 
In addition to the primary analysis described above, sensitivity and supportive analyses for the primary 
efficacy endpoint were performed.  
Examples of sensitivity and supportive analyses for the primary endpoint were: 
- 
- 
The primary efficacy endpoint analysis was repeated similarly using the CAS and the PPS. For 
these analyses the adjustment of the CMH estimates with CHW was not used. 
An additional analysis was performed using the CMH test on the FAS with the first complete wound 
closure evaluation based on the clinical assessment by the investigator and confirmed by a second 
observation after 7 days [+2 days] at the confirmation of complete closure (CCC) visit. For this 
analysis, the first wound closure will only be considered a success if both the clinical assessment 
and the second observation assess the wound as closed. 
- 
If the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint significantly favours the Oleogel-S10 group, a 
sensitivity analysis based on multiple imputation (MI) was conducted using the tipping point 
approach to assess the departures from missing at random (MAR) to missing not at random 
(MNAR) assumptions only for the FAS. The distribution of missing responses in the Oleogel-S10 
group was assumed worse than for the control group, i.e., non-closure of the EB target wound. 
Variations in the assumptions for the MI were examined to adjust the imputed values until the 
statistical significance was lost (i.e., the p-value is greater than 0.05). 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed. The sensitivity analyses use different analyses 
populations, different definitions of the endpoint and different approaches to the statistical analysis. Of 
particular interest for assessing the robustness of the results is the tipping point analysis, challenging 
the MAR assumption. The worst-case imputation is not expected to give significant results since this is 
an overly conservative analysis. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
If the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrated superiority at the 5% 
significance level, hierarchical confirmatory testing of the 6 key secondary endpoints was planned on 
the FAS and presented in this application. If the primary efficacy endpoint did not show superiority at 
the 5% significance level, the analysis of the 6 key secondary endpoints was planned as non-
confirmatory and descriptive. 
Missing data 
With respect to the endpoint of proportion of first wound closure at a specific visit x (including the 
primary endpoint), early withdrawals and patients discontinued due to target wound infection that 
were not available at visit x were considered as failures (wound not closed) if the EB target wound was 
not assessed as closed at a prior visit. If the wound was closed at a prior visit, the patient was 
considered a responder for visit x, although he/she was withdrawn or discontinued before visit x. 
Missing data was imputed as failures in the primary analysis. Since more subjects discontinued the 
double-blind phase in the control treatment group than in the Oleogel-S10 treatment group this might 
not be a conservative approach for the treatment comparison. Hence, the sensitivity analyses are of 
importance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022

Interim Analysis 
An unblinded interim analysis (IA) for sample size re-estimation took place when approximately 50% 
of subjects completed Day 45. The interim analysis included an unblinded sample size re-estimation 
using the CHW approach and a computation of the conditional power to check for futility [Cui 1999]. 
In addition to the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, the interim analysis also included results of 
some selected secondary efficacy endpoints (descriptive summaries only) to allow the IDMC the 
flexibility to recommend study continuation in the event that the conditional power was <80% with the 
maximum sample size allowed. Depending on the results of the sample size re-estimation, the IDMC 
could have recommended to continue with the initial sample size, increase the sample size, or stop the 
study for futility. The IDMC recommended to increase the sample size. 
The CHW weighted test-statistics for consideration of sample size re-estimation did not require an 
adjustment of the significance level for the sample size increase after the IA. 
However, as outlined above, the concerns related to adequate type I error control with the CHW 
method, as well as the multiple amendments to both the protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
and an absence of statistically compelling evidence from a single pivotal trial put the robustness of the 
efficacy results at question. 
In the response, the applicant provided a clear list of the important protocol changes, and no issues 
arise. The increase in sample size as a consequence of the sample size re-estimation has been pre-
specified in the original protocol. The Primary endpoint was updated in version 5 of the Protocol. The 
requirement for target wound to be confirmed as closed within 7 days after first closure was removed 
from the primary endpoint and included as a sensitivity analysis. This sensitivity analysis was 
consistent with the analysis of the new primary endpoint. Hence, this change is not considered to have 
altered any conclusions from the trial. The Cui-Hung-Wang method is agreed to adequately control the 
type-I error. Also see section 2.6.6 ‘Discussion on clinical efficacy’. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Double-Blind Phase 
Overall, 199 (89.2%) subjects completed the DBP of the study (91.7%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 86.8%, 
control gel), and 24 (10.8%) subjects discontinued (8.3%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 13.2%, control gel). Thus, 
the rate of completion in the double-blind part of the study was high. 
The most common reasons for discontinuation from the DBP were reasons classified as Other and 
withdrawal of consent. 
Six (2.7%) subjects, 3 (2.8%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 3 (2.6%) in the control gel group, 
discontinued the DBP for reasons classified as Other. These included eligibility criteria not being met / 
randomisation error (n=3); anticipated use of non-permitted concomitant medication (n=1); relocation 
(n=1); and reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=1). 
Another 6 (2.7%) subjects, 2 (1.8%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 4 (3.5%) in the control gel group, 
discontinued the DBP due to withdrawn consent. Additional information was available for 3 of these 6 
subjects; reasons for withdrawal included parental decision (n=1 per group) and dissatisfaction with 
treatment and difficulty reaching the clinic (n=1). 
Five (2.2%) subjects, 3 (2.8%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 2 (1.8%) in the control gel group, 
discontinued the DBP due to an AE.

Three (1.3%) subjects, 1 (0.9%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 2 (1.8%) in the control gel group, 
discontinued the DBP at the investigator’s discretion. 
Figure 7. Flow Diagram of Subject Disposition: Double-Blind Phase (All Subjects) 
Open-Label Phase 
Overall, the most common reason for discontinuation from the OLP was withdrawal of consent 
(12.1%). For 10 of these 12 subjects, withdrawal of consent was due to lack of efficacy (n=2, former 
Oleogel-S10 vs. n=3, former control gel), non-compliance (n=2, former Oleogel-S10), worsening of 
lesion (n=1, former Oleogel-S10), an AE (product adhesion issue; n=1, former control gel), and 
parental decision to withdraw due to itch (n=1, former control gel). Additional details were not 
provided for the other 17 subjects who withdrew consent. 
Thirteen (5.8%) subjects, 6 (5.5%) in the former Oleogel-S10 group and 7 (6.1%) in the former 
control gel group, discontinued the OLP due to an AE. Ten (4.5%) subjects discontinued the OLP for 
reason classified as Other; e.g. ineffective treatment (n=3, all of whom had received control gel in the 
DBP). One case of fatal acute kidney injury was reported as an SAE (Subject former Oleogel-S10); 
however, the investigator reported the reason for discontinuation from the OLP as Other.

Table 4. Subject Disposition: Open-Label Phase (All Randomised Subjects) 
In data submitted with the Day 120 response, the applicant provided an update on the study. A total of 
84 (41.0%) of 205 subjects have completed the OLP (including the 1 subject without an EOLP visit), 
and 62 subjects (30.2%) have discontinued the OLP; 60 subjects are currently continuing in the OLP 
and all of these have reached the Month 12 visit. Overall improvements seen with Oleogel-S10 
treatment during the DBP were generally maintained during the OLP (mostly assessed at Month 3).  
Further data will be provided when available (i.e., by Q1 2023). 
•  Recruitment 
Double-blind phase 
A total of 252 subjects were screened (Figure 7); of these, 223 subjects were randomised to Oleogel-
S10 (N=109) or control gel (N=114). Randomised subjects were enrolled across 49 sites in 26 
countries and several geographic regions, including the US, Europe, South America, and Rest of World 
(Australia, Georgia, Hong Kong, Israel, Russia, Singapore, and Ukraine). 
Open-label phase 
A total of 205 (91.9%) subjects continued into the OLP and received treatment with Oleogel-S10. This 
included 199 subjects who completed the DBP and 6 subjects (all in the control gel group) who 
discontinued the DBP prematurely due to worsening of the EB target wound status or due to EB target 
wound infection and continued into the OLP prematurely (at the investigator’s discretion). Results for 
the OLP are presented by former treatment group in the DBP (the denominator used was the total 
number of subjects enrolled in the DBP (N=223), rather than the number of subjects who entered the 
OLP (N=205)). 
At the time of data cut-off for the initial report, 134 (60.1%) subjects were ongoing in the OLP 
(60.6%, former Oleogel-S10 vs. 59.6%, former control gel); 19 (8.5%) subjects had completed the 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022

OLP (8.3%, former Oleogel-S10 vs. 8.8%, former control gel); and 52 (23.3%) subjects had 
discontinued the OLP (22.9%, former Oleogel-S10 vs. 23.7%, former control gel). 
•  Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 78 (35.0%) subjects, 35 (32.1%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 43 (37.7%) in the control gel 
group, had a major protocol deviation related to the investigational product. The most common 
deviations of this nature were non-compliance with investigational product administration regimen 
(i.e., study medication not applied to all wounds, study medication applied on top of dressings, or 
frequency of dressing change >4 days) (17.4%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 21.9%, control gel) and incorrect 
(i.e., incomplete or missing) return of the investigational product kit / tubes (13.8%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 
15.8%, control gel). 
A total of 68 (30.5%) subjects, 31 (28.4%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 37 (32.5%) in the control gel 
group, had a major protocol deviation related to use of prohibited concomitant treatment / prohibited 
dressings. This primarily involved use of prohibited wound dressings (26 [23.9%] subjects, Oleogel-
S10 vs. 30 [26.3%] subjects, control gel). 
Thirty-nine (17.5%) subjects, 21 (19.3%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 18 (15.8%) in the control gel 
group, had a major protocol deviation due to a missed visit / visit outside window up to and including 
Day 45±7 days. These were primarily due to visits outside window (15.6%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 10.5%, 
control gel). 
Twenty-seven (12.1%) subjects, 12 (11.0%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 15 (13.2%) in the control 
gel group, had a major protocol deviation involving the ICF. Informed consent was obtained from all 
subjects in the study. 
Six (2.7%) subjects, 4 (3.7%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 2 (1.8%) in the control gel group, had a 
major protocol deviation classified as Other. These deviations involved disclosure of subject data / 
confidentiality breach, primarily related to inclusion of the subject’s name on betulin samples sent for 
analysis.

In the Safety Analysis Set, 60% of subjects were male and 40% were female. The median age was 12 
years (range 6 months to 81 years). Divided by age categories, 8% of subjects were 0 to <4 years of 
age, 38% were 4 to <12 years, 24% were 12 to <18 years, and 30% were ≥18 years of age. Of the 
67 subjects who were ≥18 years of age, 3 subjects were 65 years of age or older. Thus, the majority 
of subjects were in the age range 4-12 years and very few subjects were elderly (only three aged 
above 65 years). This reflects a population with severe EB, i.e., that the condition is present from birth 
and that many EB patients with severe forms like DEB or JEB have a limited life span.  
The majority (>80%) of subjects were White. Geographic regions in which subjects were enrolled 
(based on study site locations) included Europe (46%), South America (30.5%), Rest of World (17%), 
and the US (6%). 
The mean BMI of subjects was 16.2 kg/m2. Approximately half (51.6%) of subjects were underweight; 
38.6% had normal weight; 5% were overweight; and 5% were obese. This also reflects a severely 
affected EB population, where many patients have nutritional problems. 
One-third of subjects had a low albumin at baseline. Nearly two-thirds of the study population was 
anemic at baseline (defined differentially based on age and/or gender). The majority of subjects in the 
study population had normal renal function at baseline. 
Overall, the demographics were well balanced between the two treatment groups. 
The reported comorbidities (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, 
skin disorders other than EB, metabolism and nutrition disorders, infections) are generally anticipated 
in subjects with EB and are related to the disease and its complications. Medical and surgical histories 
were generally well balanced between the treatment groups, with some imbalances in pruritus and 
pain. 
Prior and concomitant medication use were overall well balanced between treatment groups, although 
the proportions of subjects who used a dermatological medication both prior to and during the study 
were lower in the Oleogel-S10 group than in the control gel group. 
The baseline clinical/disease characteristics of the treatment groups are displayed below.

Table 6. Epidermolysis Bullosa Subtype and Method of Diagnosis (Safety Analysis Set) 
In the Safety Analysis Set, 87% subjects had the DEB subtype of EB; of these, 175 (78.5%) subjects 
had RDEB and 20 (9%) subjects had DDEB. Twenty-six (11.7%) subjects had JEB. Two (0.9%) 
subjects had EBS, since implementation of Version 4.0 of the protocol, subjects with EBS were 
excluded from study participation. None of the subjects had Kindler syndrome. 
Most of the 175 subjects with RDEB had generalized RDEB classified as severe or intermediate. Of the 
26 subjects with JEB, most had generalized JEB classified as severe or intermediate.  
EB subtype identification was based on genetic testing in 129 (57.8%) subjects, clinical diagnosis only 
in 49 (22.0%) subjects, immunofluorescence mapping or electron microscopy in 41 (18.4%) subjects, 
and method classified as Other in 4 (1.8%) subjects.  
Justifications for clinical diagnosis only was requested. In the response, the applicant clarified that 
since genetic confirmation of the EB subtype could only be offered to subjects participating in BEB-13 
at a later stage of the study due to operational reasons, an additional 4 subjects now have genetic 
confirmation of diagnosis, which reduced the proportion with clinical diagnosis only to 20.2%. In 
addition, since the OLP Month 12 Efficacy DBL genetic testing results have been received from the 
central laboratory for a further 11 subjects. Approximately 8 additional subjects are planned to 
undergo genetic testing prior to final database lock. Thus, it is anticipated that for the final CSR the 
proportion of subjects with clinical diagnosis only will be reduced to approximately 12%. This is 
acknowledged.  
According to the applicant, a clinical diagnosis was in some cases seemingly only based on the 
presence of one clinical feature, e.g., anaemia or of dystrophic nails. This may seem very limited to 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 64/162 
 
 
 
 
 
establish an EB diagnosis, however, for inclusion in the study, criteria based on a target wound of 
specific size and duration was also required. 
It is also noted that according to the EB Consensus (Fine et al., 2014), which was accepted as the 
global standard at the time the study protocol was written, genetic confirmation was not required in 
order to make the diagnosis of EB. Even the current revised consensus classification of inherited EB is 
still primarily clinically oriented, as the EB classification is complex (Has, 2020).  
It is acknowledged that a specific diagnosis of EB subtype can be challenging, and it is agreed that the 
chance of misdiagnosis or misclassification is low. The applicant used the available guideline and 
methods at the time when the pivotal study BEB-13 was planned.  
The DEB and JEB disease subtypes and methods of diagnosis were generally well balanced between the 
2 treatment groups. However, within the DEB subtype, the Oleogel-S10 group had a higher proportion 
of subjects with RDEB compared to the control gel (83.5%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 73.7%, control gel) and a 
lower proportion of subjects with DDEB (5.5%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 12.3%, control gel). 
Target Wound characteristics 
Table 7. Summary of Target Wounds (Safety Analysis Set) 
Overall, the mean (SD) size of the target wound in the Safety Analysis Set was 19.20 (9.4) cm2 (range 
10 cm2 to 49.5 cm2). The majority (64.6%) of subjects had a target wound between 10 to <20 cm2; 
21.1% between 20 to <30 cm2, and 14.3% between 30 to 50 cm2. 
Mean (SD) age of the target wound was 125.4 (399.5) days (range 21 days to 4745 days); median 
wound age was 35.5 days. Fourteen subjects (n=8, Oleogel-S10 vs. n=6, control gel) with wounds 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 65/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over 9 months of age (range: 11.5 to 156 months) were enrolled prior to the implementation of 
Version 4.0 of the protocol, which capped eligibility for the target wound at a maximum of 9 months 
for wound age. Hence, the overall median wound age is more meaningful than the mean wound age. 
In the subset of subjects with a target wound age of no more than 9 months (N=208), median wound 
age was 32.0 days. 
The most common locations of target wounds were the lower leg (20.2%), knee (13.5%), and thigh 
(13.5%). Target wound size was well balanced between the two treatment groups; however, the 
median wound age was slightly greater in the Oleogel-S10 group (39 days, vs. 32 days for control gel). 
It was not fully clear how large body surface area in total that was treated. This was clarified in a 
safety question. 
In the Safety Analysis Set, the 1 subject reported as not having a partial-thickness wound was 1 of 3 
subjects who did not meet eligibility criteria for a partial-thickness target wound. These 3 subjects 
were randomized in error and subsequently withdrawn shortly after randomization; they were excluded 
from the PPS. 
In the Safety Analysis Set, most (78.0%) of the subjects used a permitted contact layer / dressing on 
the target wound up to 45 and 90 days on study. Results were well balanced between treatment 
groups. The use of nonpermitted wound dressings is described below. 
The majority of subjects changed their dressings daily (44.4%) or every 2 days (37.7%). Most 
subjects (91%) used the same type of dressing for all of their wounds (i.e., target, additional, and 
other). Results were similar between the two treatment groups. 
Characteristics of additional wounds matching Target wound criteria 
On Day 0, the investigator selected the EB target wound and up to 4 additional wounds that met target 
wound criteria. A total of 63 subjects had at least 1 additional wound other than the EB target wound 
that met target wound criteria. Most of these subjects had no more than 2 additional wounds that met 
the criteria. A higher proportion of subjects had 2 or more additional wounds in the control gel group 
(13/30, 43.3%) compared to the Oleogel-S10 group (8/33, 24.2%). The median age of additional 
wounds was also greater in the control gel group (56 days vs. 41 days, Oleogel-S10). 
Stratification Based on Disease Subtype and Size of Target Wound 
In the Safety Analysis Set, the 2 largest stratification groups (based on actual data) were DEB 10 to 
<20 cm2 (128 [57.4%] subjects) and DEB 20 to <30 cm2 (43 [19.3%] subjects) (Table 8). 
Stratification was well balanced between the 2 treatment groups.

Table 8. Stratification Based on Disease Subtype and Size of Target Wound (Safety Analysis Set) 
Other Baseline Wound Characteristics 
Using the full EBDASI, total wound burden is rated as mild (EBDASI total score 0-42), moderate 
(EBDASI total score 43-106) or severe (EBDASI total score >106). However, since only Section I of the 
EBDASI assessing Skin Activity (blistering/erosions/crusting) was used in this study, it was not possible 
for subjects to be classified as having a severe total wound burden. The maximum possible score of 
the partial EBDASI based on Skin Activity only was 100, which falls below the score needed to be 
classified as severe (>106). 
In the Full Analysis Set, the mean EBDASI skin activity score was 19.6 (SD: 11.91) at baseline. 
The majority (57.8%) of subjects had a total BSAP <10% at baseline. More than half of the subjects 
had a total wound area <0.1 m2 (55.2%); 34.5% had a total wound area between 0.1 m2 and 0.3 m2. 
Baseline characteristics displayed in  
Table 9 were generally well balanced between treatment groups.

All of the randomised subjects (N=223) were included in the Safety Analysis Set and the FAS. One 
hundred eighty-five (83.0%) subjects were included in the PPS, and 199 (89.2%) subjects were 
included in the CAS.

Table 10. Analysis Sets (All Randomized Subjects) 
Subjects were excluded from the PPS based upon review of protocol deviations and case-by-case 
decisions made during the blind data review meeting held prior to database lock and unblinding of the 
DBP. Subjects may have been excluded from the PPS for more than one reason.  
A total of 38 (17.0%) subjects, 17 (15.6%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 21 (18.4%) in the control gel 
group, were excluded from the PPS. The most common reasons for exclusion from the PPS were 
missed visit(s) up to and including Day 45 and missed closure of wound clinical assessment up to and 
including Day 45.  
Ten (4.5%) subjects, 7 (6.4%) in the Oleogel-S10 group and 3 (2.6%) in the control gel group, were 
excluded from the PPS for “other major protocol deviations which were regarded as clinically relevant.” 
These involved treatment non-compliance, incorrect administration of investigational product, incorrect 
return of investigational product, and tube of investigational product used more than once. 
The CAS includes all subjects from the FAS who did not discontinue the DBP of the study early, 
irrespective of the reason for discontinuation.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Table 11. Primary Efficacy Analysis: Proportion of Subjects with First Complete Closure of Target 
Wound within 45 Days Based on Clinical Assessment (Full Analysis Set) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met as the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the 
EB target wound within 45 days of initiating treatment was higher in the Oleogel-S10 group (41.3%) 
compared to the control gel group (28.9%). This finding was statistically significant in favour of 
Oleogel-S10 based on the CHW method using the CMH test statistics (p=0.013) and based on the 
unadjusted CMH test (p=0.041). 
Even if study BEB-13 met its primary endpoint the difference between treatments is however small 
(12.4 % units) and the results are not of high statistical significance. Results for the PPS population did 
not reach statistical significance (p=0.151) even if the magnitude of the difference was almost similar 
to the FAS (Oleogel-S10 42.4% vs. control gel 33.3%, respectively). 
Since the primary analysis used a non-responder imputation for missing data and the amount of 
missing data was larger in the control treatment group than in the Oleogel-S10 treatment group, this 
was not considered a sufficiently conservative analysis. The tipping point analysis described in the SAP 
using multiple imputation (MI) is considered of particular interest. The MI analysis without tipping gave 
borderline significant results and switching the result for only one control patient resulted in a non-
significant p-value. Hence, the robustness of the results was questioned, and the applicant was asked 
to discuss this.  
In the D120 response, the applicant provided further information on amount of missing data at the day 
45 visit arguing that the amount and reasons of missing data was similar in the two treatment groups. 
This is agreed. However, this is no guarantee that data are Missing at Random (MAR). There could still 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 70/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be mechanisms deviating from the MAR assumption that would create bias in the comparison. Hence, 
the tipping point analysis evaluating robustness to any such bias is still considered important. 
In the pre-planned tipping point analysis, the MI analysis on original data gave borderline significant 
results and switching the result for only one control patient resulted in a non-significant p-value. 
The applicant argued that the CMH (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel) test did not work well with small strata 
and has provided post hoc analyses combining or removing the three JEB/Kindler strata. In those 
analyses the p-value was slightly smaller and switching one subject did not yield non-significant results 
(however switching two subjects did). The applicant hence considered that the primary analysis was 
robust and driven by the largest cohort, namely the dystrophic EB subtype. This was not agreed by the 
CHMP. Those analyses were performed post-hoc and were not prespecified in the SAP. 
In conclusion, the primary analysis was borderline significant. The amount and reason of missing data 
at day 45 was similar between the two treatment groups, however the analysis still depends on the 
assumption of MAR. This assumption cannot be verified, and the results are not very robust when 
those assumptions are challenged with the tipping point analysis.  
Although the primary endpoint was statistically significant at the nominal (2 sided) 5% level, this was 
not statistically compelling in the context of a single pivotal trial. This compounded with several 
amendments to the SAP and protocol as well as concerns about type I error control with the CHW 
method, raised questions around the integrity of the data. Both p-values of 0.041 and 0.013 as 
reported above are questionable. In the D120 response, justification for adequate type I error control 
with the CHW method was provided. Hence, even if concerns related to the type I error control have 
been alleviated, it was still questioned whether the results are sufficiently robust and compelling, thus 
a major objection was raised.  
The non-responder imputation was questioned for one particular control patient who had the Day 45 
investigator assessment of closure performed outside of the visit window but the patient reported that 
the target wound had closed within the visit window. At the oral explanation and upon request from 
the CHMP, the applicant presented results of the primary efficacy analysis switching this one single 
patient from non-responder to responder using the CHW methodology. This analysis demonstrated that 
the p-value remained statistically significant (i.e., p-value=0.021) with only small changes to point 
estimate and confidence interval. 
The results presented by stratification factor are presented in Table 12. 
Table 12. Proportion of Subjects with First Complete Closure of Target Wound within Day 45 by 
Stratification Factor (Full Analysis Set)

For the above presentation based on stratification factors, the DEB strata showed higher rates of 
wound closure for Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel across wound size. For the JEB/Kindler sub-types, 
however, the patient numbers were much smaller (n=26 in total) and conclusions are difficult to make. 
Secondary endpoints 
The applicant had defined six ‘key’ secondary endpoints of the total 18 secondary endpoints in the 
protocol. The results for the first key secondary endpoint were not statistically significant, hence, the 
results for the key secondary endpoints are not confirmatory. The p-values reported for other analyses 
of the key secondary endpoints are not adjusted for multiplicity. The method of multiplicity adjustment 
was hierarchical: if the first secondary endpoint was not statistically significant, statistical testing on 
the remaining would not be possible. Consequently, all other secondary endpoints for the purpose of 
statistical inference were not considered.   
Time to First Complete Closure of the EB Target Wound as by Clinical Assessment until EDBP (Day 90)  
For the first key secondary endpoint (time to first complete closure of the EB target wound as 
evidenced by clinical assessment within 90 days) the difference between the 2 treatment groups was 
not statistically significant (p=0.302). The median time to closure within 90 days was similar between 
treatment groups (92 days Oleogel-S10 and 94 days control gel). This was the case also for the CAS 
and PPS populations.  
Figure 8. Time to First Complete Closure of the Target Wound within 90 Days (Full Analysis Set) 
Proportion of Subjects with First Complete Closure of the Target Wound Within 90 Days 
The second key secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the 
EB target wound within 90 days of treatment based on clinical assessment by the investigator. Within 
90 days, 50.5% of subjects in the Oleogel-S10 group achieved first EB target wound closure vs. 43.9% 
of subjects in the control gel group. The difference in proportions was not statistically significant based 
on the CMH test stratified by EB subtype and target wound size class (p=0.296). 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 72/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In both treatment groups, the percentages of subjects with first complete closure within 90 days were 
somewhat higher than those observed for first complete closure within 45 days, representing additional 
target wound closure in 27 total subjects (10 subjects, Oleogel-S10; 17 subjects, control gel) between 
Day 45 and Day 90. 
Incidence of Target Wound Infection Between Baseline and Day 90 
Overall, as evidenced by wound infection AEs and/or use of topical and/or systemic antibiotics (related 
to wound infection), 7 subjects (3.1%) had a target wound infection between baseline and Day 90. Of 
these, two subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 (1.8%) experienced a target wound infection between 
baseline and Day 90 compared with five subjects treated with control gel (4.4%) (p=0.326).  
After database lock it was noted that an AE of wound infection in one subject was incorrectly reported 
in a target wound; this wound was in fact an infection in a nontarget, ‘other’ wound (which was 
bacteriologically confirmed and mild in severity). Therefore, only 1 Oleogel-S10 subject (0.9%) 
had a target wound infection between baseline and Day 90. A post hoc analysis to reflect the correct 
categorisation of the location of the wound infection (1 [0.9%] Oleogel-S10 subject vs. 5 [4.4%] 
control gel subjects; p=0.142) was presented. 
One (0.9%) target wound infection in subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 was bacteriologically 
confirmed and 2 of 5 (1.8%) target wound infections in subjects treated with control gel were 
bacteriologically confirmed. Both target wound infections in Oleogel-S10 subjects and 3 of the 5 target 
wound infections in control gel subjects were treated with concomitant medications. 
Incidence of Nontarget Wound Infections Between Baseline and Day 90 
Wounds that met target criteria but were not selected as target wound were considered ‘additional’ 
wounds and wounds that did not meet target wound criteria were considered ‘other’ wounds. 
The incidence of infections in nontarget wounds between baseline and Day 90 was assessed. Very few 
(3 [1.3%]) subjects had infections in ‘additional’ wounds that met target wound criteria within Day 90: 
2 (1.8%) subjects in the Oleogel-S10 group and 1 (0.9%) subject in the control gel group. 
Thirty subjects (13.5%) had wound infections in ‘other’ wounds within Day 90: 12 (11.0%) subjects in 
the Oleogel-S10 group and 18 (15.8%) subjects in the control gel group. Eleven of the 12 other wound 
infections in subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 were evidenced by AEs and 5 were bacteriologically 
confirmed. All but one (n=11) of the other wound infections in Oleogel-S10 subjects were treated with 
concomitant medications. 
Maximum Severity of EB Target Wound Infection Between Baseline and Day 90 
Based on AE reporting of PTs for wound infection only, 5 subjects had a target wound infection 
between baseline and Day 90. Of these, the infection reported by the 1 subject who received Oleogel-
S10 was classified as mild, and those reported by subjects who received control gel were moderate (3 
subjects) or severe (1 subject)). Each of these wounds was treated with a concomitant medication. 
Maximum Severity of Non-target Wound Infections Between Baseline and Day 90 
Based on AE reporting of PTs for wound infection only, the maximum severity of infections in 
‘additional’ wounds that met target wound criteria was mild (n=1) or moderate (n=1), both in subjects 
in the Oleogel-S10 group. 
For other wounds (that did not meet target wound criteria), the maximum severity of infections was 
mostly mild (8 [7.3%] Oleogel-S10 subjects; 6 [5.3%] control gel subjects), with moderate wound 
infections in 2 (1.8%) Oleogel-S10 subjects and 6 (5.3%) control gel subjects, and severe wound 
infections in 1 (0.9%) subject in the Oleogel-S10 group and 3 (2.6%) subjects in the 
control gel group.

Change from Baseline in Total Body Wound Burden at Day 90 
The evaluation of TBWB was based on clinical assessment using Section I (skin) of the EBDASI. The 
key secondary efficacy endpoint for change from baseline in TBWB was assessed at Day 90. The 
EBDASI skin activity score (Section I skin activity: blistering/erosions/crusting) was scored from 0 to 
10 for each of 10 anatomical locations (the anogenital and buttocks regions were excluded); therefore, 
the skin activity score could range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicative of less wound burden. 
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint analysis at Day 90, a reduction from baseline in the EBDASI 
skin activity score was observed in both groups (-0.44 Oleogel-S10 and -0.56 control gel); the 
difference between the treatment groups was negligible (0.12; p=0.887). Results across all time points 
in Table 13 suggest that there was reduction in the TBWB earlier in the course of treatment with 
Oleogel-S10, with a negligible difference observed at Day 90 compared to the control gel group.

At baseline, the mean EBDASI skin activity score was 19.6 in each treatment group. Overall, 
reductions in the EBDASI skin activity score were observed in both treatment groups throughout the 
DBP (i.e., Days 30, 60, and 90). For the secondary efficacy endpoint analysis at Day 90, EBDASI skin 
activity mean scores for the Oleogel-S10 group and control gel group both showed an improvement 
from baseline (reductions of -3.4 and -2.8, respectively).

Change from Baseline in Itching at Day 90 
Itching was evaluated as a key secondary endpoint (at Day 90) with assessments completed before 
wound dressing change. Different instruments were used based on the subject’s age: the Itch Man 
Scale for subjects ≥4 to 13 years of age (N=106) and the Leuven Itch Scale for subjects ≥14 years of 
age (N=100).  
For this key secondary efficacy endpoint at Day 90, subjects 4 to 13 years of age using the Itch Man 
Scale showed slight improvements (i.e., mean changes) from baseline in both groups (-0.44 Oleogel-
S10 group vs. -1.0 control gel group; p=0.182). 
Results for subjects ≥14 years using the Leuven Itch Scale were presented according to 6 domains 
rather than an overall score. Some sites used a VAS of incorrect length for the severity and distress 
domains of the Leuven Itch Scale, so an additional corrected analysis was performed. Across each of 
the 6 domain scores at Day 90, a reduction in itching from baseline was observed for subjects treated 
with Oleogel-S10; this was not observed for subjects who received control gel. At Day 90, greater 
mean reductions in the duration (-0.93 Oleogel-S10 vs. 0.98 control gel), consequence (-4.39 Oleogel-
S10 vs. -3.54 control gel), distress (-0.44 Oleogel-S10 vs. -0.26 control gel), and surface areas (-1.54 
Oleogel-S10 vs. 0.68 control gel) of itching were observed for the Oleogel-S10 group than the control 
gel group, while greater mean reductions from baseline in the frequency (-8.13 Oleogel-S10 vs. -10.14 
control gel) and severity (-4.95 Oleogel-S10 vs. -10.76 control gel) of itching were observed in the 
control gel group compared to the Oleogel-S10 group at Day 90. 
Additional Secondary Endpoints 
The p-values for these additional secondary efficacy analyses were not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Change from Baseline in Procedural and Background Pain 
At baseline, subjects in both groups had similar levels of pain resulting from removal of wound 
dressings and application of new dressings (i.e., procedural pain) and pain experienced between 
dressing changes (i.e., background pain). In older subjects (≥4 years), the mean procedural pain score 
at baseline was 3.7 in the Oleogel-S10 group and 3.0 in the control gel group; the mean background 
pain score was 3.2 in each treatment group. Pain in younger subjects (<4 years) was assessed using 
the FLACC Pain Rating Scale but was not discussed due to small sample size (N=17). 
In subjects ≥4 years, mean improvements compared to baseline in procedural and background pain 
were observed in both treatment groups throughout the DBP. For procedural pain, these improvements 
were greater in the Oleogel-S10 group compared to the control gel group starting at Day 14, when the 
mean change from baseline in the procedural pain score was –1.44 in the Oleogel-S10 group and  
–0.78 in the control gel group (p=0.022).  
At Day 90, the mean change from baseline in the procedural pain score was -1.32 in the Oleogel-S10 
group and -0.18 in the control gel group (p=0.051).  
For background pain, at most visits in the DBP, marginally more improvement was reported by the 
control gel group than the Oleogel-S10 group. At Day 90, mean change from baseline in the 
background pain score was -0.94 in the Oleogel-S10 group and -1.11 in the control gel group.

Proportion of Subjects with First Complete Wound Closure using Blinded Evaluation of Photographs 
In the Oleogel-S10 group, the results were consistent with those observed based on the clinical 
assessment. In the control gel group, 1 less closure was observed within the first 45 days and 2 less 
closures were observed within the first 90 days compared to the clinical assessment. 
Change from Baseline in Body Surface Area Percentage affected by Partial-Thickness Wounds by Visit 
At baseline, the mean total BSAP affected by EB partial-thickness wounds was 12.1% in the Oleogel-
S10 group and 12.2% in the control gel group. Mean decreases from baseline (i.e., reductions in the 
percentage of skin area affected by wounds) in total BSAP were observed in both treatment groups 
throughout the DBP. On Day 30, the mean change from baseline in total BSAP was -2.6% in the 
Oleogel-S10 group and -2.6% in the control gel group. At Day 60, these values were -2.9% and -
1.7%, respectively, and at EDBP (Day 90), the values were -4.3% and -2.5%, respectively. 
Overall, none of the defined six ‘key’ secondary endpoints could formally be declared positive as the 
results for the first key secondary endpoint were not statistically significant. In some cases, and at 
some time points during the DBP, the results were numerically in favour of Oleogel-S10, whereas for 
other comparisons no difference was observed. Thus, no formally demonstrated effects on wound 
infections, total body wound burden or itch can be claimed.  
For pain, which can be of great importance in EB, (denoted as an additional secondary endpoint), some 
mean improvements that were greater in the Oleogel-S10 group compared to the control gel group 
were observed, mainly for procedural pain with a statistically significant difference in favour of Oleogel-
S10 at Day 14 (nominal p-value 0.022) and also a larger difference at Day 90 (nominal p-value 0.051).  
For endpoints relating to sleep, number of days missed from school or work due to EB and overall 
treatment satisfaction, no clear beneficial effects of Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel could be observed. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Analysis taking sustained healing into account 
Subjects who had first complete closure of the target wound during the DBP were to have a 
confirmation of complete closure (CCC) assessment after 7 days (CCC assessment by the investigator 
at the site or investigator assessment of the photograph obtained at a CCC home visit). 
Assessment report

Additional analyses of the primary endpoint were performed for subjects with first complete closure of 
the EB target wound within 45 days confirmed by a CCC observation after 7 days. Forty-four subjects 
in the Oleogel-S10 group and 34 subjects in the control gel group had a CCC visit during the DBP. For 
this analysis of the primary endpoint, the first wound closure within 45 days was only considered a 
success if both the clinical assessment and the CCC observation assessed the wound as closed. Within 
45 days, a higher number of subjects in the Oleogel-S10 group achieved first complete closure which 
was confirmed by a CCC observation than subjects in the control gel group (19/109 vs. 10/114, 
respectively); the difference in proportions between the 2 treatment groups was statistically significant 
based on the CMH test stratified by EB subtype and target wound size class (p=0.048).  
Table 14. Proportion of Patients with First Complete Closure of EB Target Wound within D45±7, Clinical 
Assessment Confirmed by a Second Observation after 7+2 Days - stratified CMH test (Full Analysis 
Set) 
Most of these target wound closures within 45 days confirmed by a CCC observation occurred in the 
DEB 10 to <20 cm2 group (14/19 Oleogel-S10; 7/10 control gel). When analysed using a Fisher’s exact 
test, the OR for the comparison between treatment groups was 2.20 (95% CI: 0.91, 5.56). Analysis 
according to a Pearson’s chi-square test also resulted in an OR of 2.20 (95% CI: 0.97, 4.97). 
Thus, the sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint taking sustained healing of the target wound at 
7 days after the first healing into account, resulted in fewer subjects rated as ‘success’ for both groups, 
with 17.4% achieving confirmed closure in the Oleogel-S10 group vs. 8.8% in the control group. This 
difference was borderline significant (p=0.048).  
Sub-group analyses in study BEB-13 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, subgroup analyses for EB subtype, age group, gender, race, size of 
target wound, contact layer/dressing, baseline nutritional status, baseline anemia, and baseline renal 
function were performed for the FAS (Figure 11). Ranges for baseline nutritional status (albumin), 
baseline anemia (hemoglobin), and baseline renal function (eGFR) were divided into tertiles.

EB subtypes  
With respect to EB subtypes, there was a large difference in the numbers included with different 
subtypes, with the RDEB subtype group being largest (n=175 subjects), while the DDEB (n=20 
subjects) and JEB subtype groups (n=26 subjects) were much smaller. This is likely a reason for 
differing results for the primary endpoint, where an effect could be shown for the RDEB group (44.0% 
vs. 26.2%, respectively; CMH p=0.008), but not for the two other subtypes (same rates of closure in 
both groups for DDEB and higher rate of closure for control gel vs. Oleogel-S10 for JEB). There were 
some imbalances in numbers randomised to Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel and also imbalances with 
respect to wound size and age, that may have contributed to the differences seen. The applicant 
initially proposed an indication covering both dystrophic and junctional EB. This was questioned on the 
basis of these results. It was acknowledged that due to the even higher rarity of the DDEB and JEB 
sub-types, it may not be realistic to recruit enough patients to enable a demonstration of statistically 
significant effect within each sub-type. However, further justification for the proposed indication 
covering both DEB and JEB subtypes, with large heterogeneity in severity and presentation, was 
considered necessary. 
For the JEB subgroup, it was clarified that of the 26 subjects with JEB subtype, most had generalised 
disease (19 subjects) and would therefore represent the severe end of the spectrum. Six subjects had 
target wounds aged over 9 months (such long-lasting wounds were later excluded in a protocol 
amendment) and none of these subjects achieved closure. Several subjects also had large wounds (30-
50 cm2), for which healing also was poor. There was no treatment effect observed in the primary 
endpoint and active treatment had lower rate of healing than control (18.2% Oleogel-S10 vs. 26.7% 
control gel; p=0.522). The applicant referred to modest reductions in procedural pain during the DBP, 
however, the reductions were indeed modest and non-significant vs. control gel. 
JEB is mainly classified into two main types: JEB generalised severe (formerly known as Herlitz JEB) 
and JEB generalised intermediate (formerly known as non-Herlitz JEB).  Non-generalised severe JEB is 
the milder form. Blistering may be limited to the hands, elbows, and feet, and often improves in 
infancy. Whereas generalised severe JEB is evident at or shortly after birth, blistering is widespread in 
the body, affecting the mucosal lining of the mouth and digestive tract, and the ability to eat and 
digest food. Chronic malnutrition and stunted growth can result, and these children usually have a poor 
life expectancy. Therefore, the JEB is quite heterogeneous, and the applicant’s opinion was that as an 
increase in epithelisation is seen this is relevant no matter what subtype is involved. This was not 
agreed as it would seem more appropriate for the milder form of this disease, which is limited more to 
skin compared to the generalised junctional EB.  
While the trial included a limited number of JEB patients there was no treatment effect observed in the 
primary endpoint (p=0.522); however, target wounds that closed was swifter in the Oleogel-S10 group 
(29 vs. 48 days) in the DBP and a very modest improvement in procedural pain. Following the oral 
explanation, the remaining issue concerning the clinical robustness of the efficacy data were 
considered to be resolved by the CHMP and an indication covering both DEB and JEB subtypes was 
considered acceptable given the demonstrated clinical effect in the overall study population, with 
added information in section 4.4 of the SmPC about limited data in the JEB and DDEB subtypes. 
Further, the applicant is planning to collect additional data in particular to assess effectiveness of 
Filsuvez in patients with DEB and JEB as part of the planned PASS (AEB-21), see RMP section 2.7.  
Age group 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022

With respect to age, the largest part of the study population was aged below 18 years with the largest 
sub-group being those aged 4 to <12 years, comprising 38% overall. The subgroup 0 - <4 years was 
very small (n=17 in total, <7% of the total population). It was in the 4 to <12 years age subgroup 
that the most pronounced difference between treatments in favour of Oleogel-S10 was observed. 
Results for the other age groups below 18 years were numerically in favour of Oleogel-S10 while this 
was not the case for patients aged ≥ 18 years (odds ratio and 95% CI 0.86, 0.31; 2.43). Hence, the 
youngest age group (0-<4 years) was very small and for the oldest age group (≥18 years, i.e. adults) 
the results were not in favour of Oleogel-S10. The applicant was asked to discuss and justify the 
initially applied indication covering all ages.  
The age distribution in the 0-<4 years group was presented upon request from the CHMP. There were 
no Oleogel-S10-treated subjects aged 6-11 months (2 in the control arm), 3 were aged 12-17 months, 
3 were aged 2 years and one was aged 3 years. Thus, no patient < 1 year was exposed to Oleogel-
S10. From an efficacy perspective, the applicant presented the results for the primary endpoint in the 
≥21 days and <4 years subgroup and 71% reached closure in the Oleogel-S10 group vs. 40% in the 
control group. This is however based on very small numbers. No firm conclusions can be made 
regarding procedural pain assessed by the FLACC pain score. There was some initial improvement in 
procedural pain however this was not sustained over the duration to day 90. There was some 
improvement again at day 90 but the results were not significant.   
The applicant also referred to safety results, showing no major concerns in comparison with the overall 
study population, but again, the small number of young children make conclusions difficult. Further, in 
the 7 subjects receiving Oleogel-S10 the applicant stated that 2 patients experienced an SAE. 
Therefore, this could be higher than patients > 4 years if more patients < 4 years were to receive 
treatment. Efficacy-wise, there seems to be no reason to expect a different response with Oleogel-S10 
in the youngest, compared with older children, adolescents and adults. The treatment is topical and 
thus a need for a specific systemic exposure to achieve an effect is not relevant. The overall benefit-
risk for this age group is discussed further below, see section 2.6.6.  
Concerning adults, comprising 30% of the study population, a subgroup analysis did not show 
favourable results for Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel (odds ratio and 95% CI 0.86, 0.31; 2.43). It is 
acknowledged that the sample size for this group was small (n=67) and that many adult patients had 
large wounds. Similar to children, reductions in procedural pain were numerically larger for Oleogel-
S10 vs. control gel, without being statistically significant. Overall, no specific pattern pointing to a 
worse safety profile compared with the overall study population could be observed. The challenges of 
performing studies in a rare disease like EB are noted and subgroup analyses are not likely to 
demonstrate statistically significant effects. Therefore, the CHMP considered that, there was no obvious 
reason to exclude adult EB patients from the indication. This relates also to a potential need for an 
upper age limit. Even if there were very few EB patients aged >65 years (n=3 according to BEB-13 
CSR), an upper age limit did not seem warranted based on efficacy (or safety).  
Gender 
Results for male and female subgroups were similar to the results of the overall analysis. Gender 
subgroups included 134 males and 89 females. A higher proportion of both males and females who 
were treated with Oleogel-S10 achieved the primary endpoint than subjects who received control gel 
(males: 39.7% vs. 27.3%; females: 43.9% vs. 31.3%, respectively); these differences were not 
statistically significant (p=0.167 and p=0.097, respectively). Male and female subjects who received 
Oleogel-S10 were 39% and 56% more likely to achieve the first complete closure of the EB target 
wound within 45 days than male and female control gel subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 81/162 
 
 
 
 
Race 
Results for White subjects were similar to the results of the overall analysis. In this study, 83.4% of 
subjects were White therefore, the only race subgroup that included a sufficient number of subjects for 
meaningful analysis was White subjects (n=186). 
Size of Target Wound 
Subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 were more likely to achieve first complete closure of the EB target 
wound within 45 days than subjects who received control gel regardless of the size of the target wound 
(10 to <20 cm2 [n=144], 20 to <30 cm2 [n=47], and 30 to 50 cm2 [n=32]) (50.7% vs. 40.0%; 
26.1% vs. 8.3%; 23.5% vs. 6.7%, respectively); none of these differences were statistically significant 
(p=0.171; p=0.076; and p=0.180, respectively) 
Permitted Contact Layer/Dressing Used 
The subgroup including subjects who used a permitted contact layer/dressing included 174 subjects 
and the subgroup including subjects who did not use a permitted contact layer/dressing included 49 
subjects. Subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 were more likely to achieve the primary endpoint than 
subjects who received control gel regardless of whether a permitted contact layer/dressing was used 
(41.4% vs. 31.0%) or not used (40.9% vs. 22.2%), respectively; these differences were not 
statistically significant (p=0.096 and p=0.226, respectively). 
Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided further clarification on the protocol deviations 
related to use of prohibited dressings. The numbers of subjects with the deviation were generally 
similar between treatment groups within each of the subtype groups. Therefore, no issue arises. 
Prespecified analyses were outlined in the BEB-13 protocol and SAP to evaluate if use of permitted vs. 
non-permitted dressings affected results of the primary or the first key secondary efficacy analyses. 
The results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis and similar 
to the first key secondary efficacy endpoints. The applicant also provided a rationale for the decision on 
classification of the protocol deviations as minor, and as the sensitivity analysis did not show any 
differences the issue is considered resolved. 
Nutritional status 
Results for subjects with lower baseline albumin levels (first and second tertile subgroups) were 
generally similar to the results of the overall analysis. 
In the third tertile (normal albumin levels), a higher proportion of subjects who received control gel 
achieved the primary endpoint than subjects in the same category who received Oleogel-S10 (44.7% 
control gel vs. 37.5% Oleogel-S10); this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.743). 
Baseline characteristics showed that a much higher % of the control group (40.4%) had poor 
nutritional status Albumin 13.5 to 33 g/l compared to Oleogel-S10 cohort (29.4%). The applicant was 
asked to clarify why this occurred and whether this may have favoured Oleogel-S10 arm in the efficacy 
analysis. 
The subjects in tertile 1 (albumin ≤ 33g/L) had a lower proportion of subjects with first complete target 
wound closure than observed in the overall study population. It is noted that there was a higher 
proportion of Control gel subjects in tertile 1 (+ 14 subjects) and tertile 3 (+14 subjects) and a higher 
proportion of Oleogel-S10 subjects in tertile 2 (+20 subjects). However, the mean level of albumin was 
slightly higher in Oleogel-S10 compared to placebo which may have slightly favoured the treatment 
arm. As the median baseline albumin was the same in the 2 treatment groups, the applicant did not 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 82/162 
 
 
 
 
consider that the nutritional status of the study population favoured the Oleogel-S10 group. This was 
not entirely agreed as the mean level was higher, however this issue was not further pursued.  
Baseline Anaemia 
Results for subjects with baseline haemoglobin levels in all 3 tertiles were generally similar to the 
results of the overall analysis. A higher proportion of subjects who received Oleogel-S10 across all 
tertiles (first tertile [lowest baseline haemoglobin levels – below normal]; second tertile [below normal 
levels]; third tertile [normal levels]) achieved the primary endpoint than subjects in those categories 
who received control gel (first tertile: 38.2% vs. 16.2%; second tertile: 37.5% vs. 33.3%; third tertile: 
38.9% vs. 35.7%); the difference between treatment groups in the first tertile was statistically 
significant (p=0.039). 
Baseline Renal Function 
Results for subjects with normal baseline eGFR values (second and third tertile subgroups) were 
generally similar to the results of the overall analysis. In the first tertile of subjects with a reduced 
baseline eGFR level, a slightly higher proportion of subjects who received control gel achieved the 
primary endpoint than subjects in the same tertile who received Oleogel-S10 (38.9% control gel vs. 
34.3% Oleogel-S10); this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.596). 
Post hoc Analyses by EB Subtype and Age Group 
A post hoc analysis of the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound 
within 45 days in subjects with RDEB by age group using a Fisher’s exact test was performed. 
Results in each of the 3 paediatric subgroups (0 to <4 years [n=17], 4 to <12 years [n=85], 12 to 
<18 years [n=54]) were similar to the overall analysis with higher proportions of subjects who 
received Oleogel-S10 achieving target wound closure within 45 days than subjects who received 
control gel.  
The difference in the 4 to <12 years age group was statistically significant (p=0.022).  
However, a higher proportion of subjects who received control gel in the ≥18 years age group (n=67) 
achieved first complete closure of the EB target wound within 45 days than subjects who received 
Oleogel-S10 (43.8% control gel group vs. 34.6% Oleogel-S10 group); the difference was not 
statistically significant (p=0.745). 
When the subset of subjects with generalised severe RDEB (n=124) were evaluated in a post hoc 
analysis of the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target wound within 45 days 
using the CMH test statistic stratified by target wound size class, results were similar to the overall 
population with a higher proportion of subjects in the Oleogel-S10 group achieving closure (45.2% 
Oleogel-S10 vs. 19.4% control gel; CMH p=0.001). 
Furthermore, of these subjects with generalised severe RDEB, higher proportions of Oleogel-S10 
subjects achieved first complete closure within 45 days than control gel subjects regardless of wound 
size.

Additionally, the CHMP recommended, at the time of scientific advice/protocol assistance, considering 
seasonal change, since this may affect the EB condition. This aspect was not addressed, and the 
applicant was asked to do so. In the response, it was stated that seasonal effect in EB was mainly 
described for the EB Simplex subtype, even if changing symptoms and complications of EB have been 
rarely reported also in other EB subtypes, e.g., related to heat and humidity during the summertime. 
The lowest number of subjects was enrolled into the BEB-13 study during summer and with a very 
similar proportion in the treatment arms (13-14%). It is agreed that the number of patients enrolled 
into both Oleogel-S10 and placebo arms was very similar during summertime, which is expected to 
cause itch among children. For the other seasons there were some ‘imbalances’, however, no major 
impact on results is expected, even if no specific analyses were presented.  
•  Summary of main efficacy results 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Design 
This is a 2-part, Phase 3 study with a completed double-blind, randomised, 
controlled phase to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Oleogel-
S10 versus control gel and to assess betulin exposure in subjects with 
inherited EB. At the end of the 90-day double blind phase (DBP), subjects in 
both treatment arms entered the single-arm, open label phase (OLP) with 
Oleogel-S10 for 24 months.

Notes 
Selected endpoints were also analysed using the CAS and PPS. The results 
were similar in all analysis sets. 
Assessments for some endpoints included a Day 7 assessment. Efficacy 
assessments scheduled for Day 7 were not performed if the visit was 
conducted by phone. A large proportion of subjects had the Day 7 visit 
conducted by phone (45.3%), therefore, Day 7 results are not reported. 
As different outcome measures are used for pain and itch based on patient 
age, the number of patients in the analyses for these endpoints varies. 
In some cases, a visual analog scale that was shorter than the standard scale 
was used in error for subject assessment of severity and distress of itch for the 
Leuven Itch Scale. To account for this, analysis for the Leuven Itch Scale was 
repeated as a supportive analysis using scaled-up versions of the itch severity 
and distress scores. The scaled-up scores are reported here. 
2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no dedicated studies in special populations. Sub-group analyses from study BEB-13 are 
commented below, Ancillary analyses. There were very few elderly subjects included in study BEB-13. 
For completeness, however, the applicant was asked to complete the table below as per usual 
requirements and has provided the following table:

The applicant has completed the table, as requested, however with inclusion also of non-EB trials, e.g., 
BAK-08, BSH-10, BBW-11, BSG-12 and BSH-12. For EB only, no such table was available, however, 
according to the BEB-13 CSR, only 3 subjects > 65 years were included.  
2.6.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
There was only one pivotal study in the EB population (BEB-13). The small Phase 2 study BEB-10 had 
another type of design (intra-individual comparison). Hence, it was not considered relevant to pool 
efficacy results from these two EB studies.  
Studies submitted in the Episalvan MAA to support the STSG wound indication were included in this 
submission as supportive studies (see below). The applicant’s decision not to pool the efficacy data 
from the two EB studies and the three STSG studies was based on differences across the studies 
including number of subjects, treated population, design/use of control, exposure, treatment 
administration and wound dressings, wound characteristics, and choice of study endpoints. The 
reasons for not pooling studies within the EB indication and across EB and STSG studies were endorsed 
by the CHMP.

Methods 
This was a Phase 2 open-label, prospective, blindly evaluated controlled case series documentation to 
intra-individually compare the efficacy and tolerance of Sericare (Oleogel-S10) versus non-adhesive 
wound dressing alone in accelerating the epithelialisation of skin lesions in patients with inherited EB. 
The study was conducted as a single centre in Germany, between 3 November 2010 and 14 June 
2011. 
Patients were eligible for this study if they met the following main inclusion criteria: 
o  Patients aged 1-95 years 
o  Patients with inherited EB with at least 1 skin lesion between 10 cm2 and 200 cm2 (alternatively 2 
comparable lesions of at least 5 cm2 each) 
o  Patient and/or his/her legal representative was able and willing to follow study procedures and 
instructions including application of Sericare on (1 half of) the wound at every wound dressing 
change and conduct regular visits during the treatment period  
o  Negative pregnancy test and use of an effective method of contraception in women of childbearing 
potential; men of procreative capacity should also agree to use an effective method of 
contraception  
Patients were not eligible for this study if any of the following criteria applied: 
o  Systemic treatment with steroids during the last 30 days 
o  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or diabetic ulcers 
o  Diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the assessment 
of safety, tolerance or efficacy 
o  Skin disorders adversely affecting wound healing or involving the areas eligible for study 
treatment. 
The primary objective of the study was to compare wound re-epithelialisation of that half of the skin 
lesion, which was treated with Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing to that part of the wound, 
which was covered by non-adhesive wound dressing only (intra-individual comparison). 
The primary efficacy variable was the progress of re-epithelialisation from baseline to either D14 or 
D28 of that half of the wound treated with Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepilex) 
compared to the other part of the wound covered with non-adhesive wound dressing only (intra-
individual comparison). Alternatively, percentage change of re-epithelialisation from baseline to D14 or 
D28 of 2 comparable lesions of at least 5 cm2 each was evaluated. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate percentage of wound epithelialisation, touch sensitivity, itching, 
exudation, and assessment of efficacy (evaluated by both the investigators and patients and/or his/her 
legal representative) and assessment of tolerance (evaluated by both the investigators and patients 
and/or his/her legal representative). Incidence, severity and causality of AEs were also evaluated. 
The investigator either identified 1 skin lesion eligible for study treatment and divided it into 2 halves 
or selected 2 comparable lesions of at least 5 cm2 each eligible for study treatment. One half of the 
wound was to be treated with the investigational product Oleogel-S10 (1 cm or 125 μL or 115 mg/cm2) 
and covered by a non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepilex). The other half of the lesion was covered by 
a non-adhesive wound dressing only (Mepilex, standard of care) as control. Both primary dressings 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 93/162 
 
 
 
 
were to be kept in place by an additional conventional dressing. If the investigator had identified 2 
comparable lesions, they were to be treated correspondingly. Wound dressings were to be changed 
based on the study flow chart (about every 24 to 48 hours) until discharge from hospital or until the 
end of treatment at D14 in ‘recent wounds’ or at D28 in ‘chronic wounds’. Before start of treatment 
and at every wound dressing change photographs of the respective wounds were to be taken. 
Figure 12. Study Schema (Visual Representation of Study Periods) 
Two independent efficacy assessment experts were assigned to blindly evaluate the progress of wound 
epithelialisation in serial listings by patient.  
The statistical analyses were based on the Safety population (SP; all patients who received at least 1 
dose of Oleogel-S10), Intent-to-treat population (ITT; all patients from the SP also constituted the ITT 
and the Per-protocol population (PP; all patients from the ITT who reasonably adhered to all protocol 
conditions belonged to the PP). Binomial analysis for superiority of test treatment was used for the 
primary efficacy variable; all other analyses were explorative. Missing values were not replaced. 
This was a very small (n=10) study of Oleogel-S10 in EB patients, seen as evaluation of proof-of-
concept in this target population. The study had an intra-individual comparative design, which is rather 
common in early, explorative studies for locally applied dermatological products. The study had a wide 
age range for inclusion (1-95 years). Based on the original CSR it was not clear if EB patients of any 
sub-type could be included. In a CSR amendment, it was clarified that 9 patients diagnosed with RDEB 
and 1 patient with DDEB were included. In the amended CSR, the applicant chose to present only the 
results for the RDEB sub-group, without the patient having DDEB. In this report, however, the original 
results including both RDEB and DDEB patients are presented. The patients were to have either at 
least 1 skin lesion between 10 and 200 cm2 or 2 comparable lesions of at least 5 cm2 each.  
Both the Oleogel-S10-treated wound half and the control half of the lesion (or the second wound) were 
covered by a standard non-adhesive wound dressing, Mepilex. Thus, the control treatment was the 
standard dressing only and not another applied gel or ointment (placebo/vehicle). Wound dressings

were changed every 24 to 48 hours, which is reasonable, and the duration of treatment depended on 
whether wounds were ‘recent wounds’ (14 days) or ‘chronic wounds’ (28 days).  
This study design is reasonable for an early study and an intra-individual design has its pros and cons. 
One advantage is that the wound halves (or wounds, in case two different wounds are compared) are 
more likely to be comparable, which may not be the case if a conventional, parallel group design is 
chosen where wounds on different individuals are compared. Underlying factors affecting wound 
healing like nutritional status and general health status are thus the same for the wounds being 
compared. Disadvantages can be a risk of contamination of the untreated wounds half with active 
product from the treated wound half and that blinding can be impaired if the product is visible. 
The study was conducted open-label. Hence, the investigator, the patient and the sponsor knew the 
identity of the treatment. A blinded assessment of efficacy was to be conducted by 2 independent 
experts based on chronological series of photographs by patient taken before start of treatment, during 
wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment on D14/D28. The assessors did not know which 
(half of the) wound was treated with Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing and which one with 
non-adhesive wound dressing only.  
Results 
Ten patients were enrolled into the study and all of them were treated with study medication. Eight 
patients received 1 and 2 patients were administered 2 cycles of study treatment, 12 wounds were 
treated with study medication. None of the patients terminated the treatment prematurely.  
There was neither any deviation from inclusion nor from exclusion criteria. Treatment deviated from 
protocol once in 1 patient, whose wound was additionally treated with Lavasept cream (polyhexanid) 
on both areas (Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing and non-adhesive wound dressing only) 
due to a suspected super-infection. 
All patients completed study treatment and data on the primary efficacy variable was available in all 
patients. Hence, no patient was excluded from PP analyses and the ITT and PP populations were 
identical. 
The overall median age of patients was 20 years (range 6-48 years); 7 were male, 3 were female. It 
was clarified that a total of 5 of the 10 subjects (50%) enrolled in BEB-10 were paediatric subjects 
(<18 years). These subjects were aged 5 years, 8 years, 9 years, 15 years, and 17 years. Most 
patients had skin type I according to the Fitzpatrick classification (n = 6), while the remaining patients 
equally had skin type II (n = 2) and skin type III (n = 2), respectively. Medical history revealed pre-
existing diseases in 5 of 10 patients; 8 conditions in 7 body systems; all of them stable.  
In 7 of 12 cases, 1 skin lesion was treated; 9 of 12 wounds (75%) were ‘recent wounds’. Most 
commonly, wound size was measured using a computer (11 of 12 cases). If 1 wound was treated it 
had a median size of 35.2 cm2; in case 2 wounds received treatment they were nearly evenly large 
with median sizes of 10.3 and 10.5 cm2, respectively. The maximum wound size in the study was 90 
cm2. Single wounds were located at the lower left extremities in 4 of 7 cases, while 2 comparable 
wounds were most commonly located at the trunk (8/10).  
Efficacy results 
For the primary efficacy variable, Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepilex) significantly 
accelerated the re-epithelialisation (8 of 8 decided cases; p=0.0078, binomial test) of wounds in 
inherited EB compared to non-adhesive wound dressing only (0 of 8 decided cases).

As the efficacy of study treatments was either evaluated controversially in patients 1 and 8, or as 
being equal in patients 5 and 7, the applicant excluded these 4 wounds from the analysis of the 
primary efficacy variable. Evaluating both reviewer results independently, ‘Reviewer 1’ scored in favour 
of Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepilex) in 8 of according to his view 9 decided cases, 
‘Reviewer 2’ in 7 of based on his estimation 8 decided cases, with the remaining case scored in favour 
of non-adhesive wound dressing only (‘Reviewer 1’ in 1 of 9 decided cases, ‘Reviewer 2’ in 1 of 8 
decided cases). 
Both efficacy assessment experts were in full agreement in 7 of 12 cases, of which 5 cases were scored 
in favour of Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing, 2 cases were scored as equal, and none was 
scored in favour of non-adhesive wound dressing only. 
Table 17. Results of Blinded Efficacy Evaluation by Patient and Wound 
For the primary endpoint assessment, the evaluation was based on cases classified as ‘decided cases’. 
The applicant then concluded that Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing significantly 
accelerated the re-epithelialisation (8 of 8 decided cases; p=0.0078) of wounds in inherited EB 
compared to non-adhesive wound dressing only (0 of 8 decided cases). Thus, those cases were 
‘Reviewer 1’ and ’Reviewer 2’ came to different conclusions were denoted as ‘controversial’ and those 
were both reviewers considered the wound half results as ‘equal’ were not included. Those wounds 
were one of the reviewers considered the results as ‘equal’ while the other reviewer considered 
Oleogel-S10 to be the best, were on the hand included. This approach may be questioned. In an 
estimation per reviewer were all wounds are included, the results for Oleogel-S10 as a ‘winner’ would 
be 8 of 12 (67%) for ‘Reviewer 1’ and 7 of 12 (58%) for ‘Reviewer 2’. For those cases were both 
experts were in full agreement (7 of 12 cases), 5 cases were scored in favour of Oleogel-S10 (42%) 
while none scored in favour of non-adhesive wound dressing only. Thus, Oleogel-S10 showed the 
majority of positive results whereas the ‘Non-adhesive wound dressing’ alone was found the best in 
only two instances; with conflicting results between the reviewers for those cases.  
The DDEB patient (#7), excluded from analyses in the amended CSR as described above (however, not 
excluded in the results presented in this report), had a diagnosis of localised DDEB with blistering on 
lower legs and nail dystrophy. For this patient, both experts rated the wound halves as ‘equal’ and the 
patient was among those classified as ‘undecided’.

Concerning secondary efficacy variables, the areas treated with Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound 
dressing (Mepilex) re-epithelialised faster and to a higher degree as their median percentages of 
epithelialisation were higher on day 7±1 (69.7% vs. 57.4%, p=0.21, Wilcoxon-test) and on day 14±1 
(87.7% vs. 79.2%, p=0.33, Wilcoxon-test) than those of areas treated with non-adhesive wound 
dressing only. Thus, somewhat faster and larger degree of re-epithelialisation was observed for 
Oleogel-S10 vs. non-adhesive wound dressing alone, although not statistically significant.  
Overall, 3 of 24 areas re-epithelialised completely by the end of treatment; all of them had been 
treated with Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing. The median time to complete wound closure 
in these 3 areas was 13 days (min. 9 days; max. 15 days). 
Touch sensitivity, itching, exudation, and efficacy as rated by investigators and patients were 
comparable for the treatments. 
The efficacy results from this very small, intra-patient, open-label (but claimed reviewer-blinded) study 
are not strong, however, they provide limited support for a proof-of-concept and beneficial effects of 
Oleogel-S10 + non-adhesive wound dressing vs. non-adhesive wound dressing alone in the re-
epithelialisation of EB wounds. The majority of patients had RDEB. 
Study AHV-18 A 
Methods 
This was an exploratory, randomised, intrasubject-controlled study of the cutaneous healing properties 
of petrolatum versus the control gel for Oleogel-S10 (developed for use in study BEB-13) versus no 
treatment, when applied topically to mechanically induced partial-thickness wounds in healthy adult 
subjects. The study was conducted at a single centre in Germany between 23 January 2020 and 04 
March 2020. The results from this study were to be used to inform the design of a confirmatory, Phase 
2 study (Study AHV-18-B), including calculation of an appropriate sample size. 
Twelve adult healthy volunteers (male or female) aged 18 to 45 years with skin Type II to III 
according to the Fitzpatrick classification were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included known or suspected 
defect of wound healing, any kind of skin barrier impairment, sunburn, or scars/tattoos/other skin 
signs that may have interfered with study procedures/measurements. Subjects who planned to 
undergo ultraviolet light sessions or sun exposure of the arms during the study were also excluded. 
Subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to one of the components of the investigational 
medicinal product or an allergy to the dressing to be used were not permitted to enrol in the study. 
Other exclusion criteria included: use of any treatment which may have affected blood coagulation and 
haemostasis, any physical treatment (like laser or surgery) on the arms in the six months prior to the 
study, use of topical or systemic treatments on the investigational areas within four weeks prior to the 
study, use of systemic antibiotics, systemic or topical steroids within two weeks of Day 1, and medical 
history of skin cancer. 
Randomised subjects had 3 abrasive wounds of approximately 8 mm diameter in 3 mini-zones (A, B, 
and C) created on the non-dominant volar forearm. The distance between the wounds was 3 cm. 
Abrasive wounds were created using a sterile scrub brush using moderate pressure until the first signs 
of epidermal removal and punctuate bleeding were visible. The 3 wounds were labelled as A, B, and C 
using a skin marker. 
Each subject’s 3 wounds received either treatment with petrolatum (ALLERGIKA – BASISSALBE, 
ingredients per 100 g: white petrolatum 95 g, liquid paraffin 5 g), the control gel for Oleogel-S10, or 
no treatment (one treatment per wound area [A, B, and C]) once daily for 21 days according to their 
randomly assigned treatment sequence. Petrolatum was chosen as it was considered an example of a

standard topical product to promote cutaneous healing in the management of wounds caused by EB. 
All mechanically induced wounds were covered with non-adhesive wound dressing (Mepitel Film) from 
Day 1 through Day 10. The untreated control had no topical treatment applied but was also covered 
with a non-adhesive wound dressing. Neither the study personnel who created the abrasive wounds 
and administered treatment nor the subjects were blinded. However, the investigators and study staff 
who performed the wound assessments were blinded to treatment. 
Wound healing was assessed using clinical assessment of cutaneous wound healing, measurement of 
wound area (planimetry), assessment of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and clinical assessment of 
local intolerance from Day 1 through Day 28. A 6-category clinical score was used to assess the degree 
of epithelialisation (0=0% [no healing], 1=1 to 25% re-epithelialisation, 2=26 to 50% 
re-epithelialisation, 3=51 to 75% re-epithelialisation, 4=greater than 75% re-epithelialisation, but not 
complete healing, 5=100% re-epithelialisation [complete healing]). 
For measurement of wound area, standardised photographs of each wound were taken on Day 1, then 
every 2 days through Day 23, and on Day 28. At least 2 photographs were obtained at each timepoint, 
and the best image (after assessment for clarity and quality) was stored for subsequent image 
analysis. Wound healing measurements (planimetry) were performed by computerised image analysis 
using the software ImageJ. Transepidermal water loss was measured according to international 
guidelines (Rogiers 2001). 
The primary efficacy endpoints were days until complete healing according to clinical score and days 
until complete healing according to planimetry. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were mean clinical score per day, mean wound surface area in mm2, and 
mean TEWL per wound in g/h/m2. 
This was an exploratory study; hence, only descriptive statistical methods were applied. The 
investigational medicinal products (IMPs) and the untreated control were not compared using a 
statistical test; no null hypotheses were tested. 
Results 
A total of 12 subjects were randomised in this study. Of the 12 subjects randomised, 11 subjects 
(91.7%) completed the study. One subject discontinued after Day 13 as he failed to return at Day 14. 
As this subject had achieved complete wound healing according to planimetry (all wounds) prior to his 
withdrawal, he was included in the analyses based on planimetry data but was excluded from the 
analyses based on clinical score due to missing data. Planimetry measurements (Day 11 to Day 13) 
were missing for another subject who did complete the study; this subject was included for analyses 
based on clinical score but excluded from analyses based on planimetry data. 
Twelve subjects (6 male and 6 female) aged 20 to 41 years were randomized and treated. Prior to 
wound induction, mean baseline TEWL was 7.5 g/m2/h (SD: 0.7). Baseline TEWL for all subjects 
ranged from 6.4 to 8.8 g/m2/h. 
Primary Endpoint 
Mean days to complete wound healing according to clinical score were similar for all treatments 
(13.3 days for untreated wounds and wounds treated with control gel, 13.4 days for wounds treated 
with petrolatum). All wounds were considered healed according to clinical score within 16 days.

Mean days to complete wound healing according to planimetry were similar for all treatments 
(10.6 days for untreated wounds and wounds treated with control gel and 10.5 days for wounds 
treated with petrolatum). All wounds were considered healed according to planimetry by Day 13. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Time to complete wound healing according to clinical score was similar for all treatments. Median 
clinical scores for untreated wounds and wounds treated with control gel or petrolatum were 5 (100% 
re-epithelialisation/complete wound healing) by Day 14 and all wounds were considered healed 
according to clinical score within 16 days. 
On Day 1 (following wound induction), mean wound surface area according to planimetry was similar 
for the 3 treatments (42.9, 44.2 and 43.2 mm2 for the untreated wounds, wounds treated with 
petrolatum, and wounds treated with control gel, respectively). From Day 13 onwards, mean wound 
surface area was 0 mm2 for untreated wounds and those treated with petrolatum or control gel. Mean 
wound surface areas on Days 3 to 11 were similar for untreated wounds and those treated with 
petrolatum or control gel. Area under the curve for wound surface area according to planimetry was 
also similar for all treatments. 
On Day 1 (following wound induction), mean TEWL was similar in wound areas for the 3 treatments 
(77.4, 75.5, and 76.2 g/m2/h for the untreated wounds, wounds treated with petrolatum, and wounds 
treated with control gel, respectively). Mean TEWL decreased over time for untreated wounds and 
those treated with petrolatum or control gel; there were no clinically relevant differences in mean 
TEWL per day between untreated wounds and wounds treated with petrolatum or control gel. 
Study AHV-18-B 
Methods 
Study AHV-18-B was conducted at the phase 1 unit in the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany 
and enrolled 16 subjects. The [AHV-18-B protocol] was submitted and approved by BfArM on 29 
September 2020 and by the Ethics Committee of the ‘Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin’ 
on 02 October 2020, however, the global COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact. This trial was not 
permitted to commence by the host institution until late April 2021 with a reduced rate of enrolment in 
order to comply with site COVID-19 mandated restrictions. Subject enrolment has been completed and 
all subjects completed the follow-up visit on 16 June 2021. The database was locked on 12 July 2021. 
The final study report was included in the Day 180 response, as requested. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the control gel was non-inferior to petrolatum with 
regards to time to achieve cutaneous healing of mechanically induced partial thickness wounds in 
healthy volunteers.   
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the change in cutaneous healing per day of mechanically 
induced wounds following application of control gel and petrolatum, and to assess the safety and 
Assessment report

tolerability of control gel and petrolatum as assessed by the incidence, severity, and relatedness of 
adverse events (AEs) in healthy volunteers with mechanically induced wounds. 
Subjects provided written informed consent before any study procedures were performed. A medical 
examination was performed within 2 weeks but no less than 3 days before inclusion in the study. This 
examination included a review of the subjects’ medical history, a physical examination, clinical 
laboratory tests, and serology tests to confirm eligibility. 
The investigational area was identified on the nondominant forearm. Two minizones (A and B) of 
approximately 8 mm diameter were defined using standardised templates. Two abrasive wounds were 
created on the 2 minizones. The selected skin areas were disinfected and a flexible template with 2 
circular holes of 8 mm diameter was closely attached to the skin, which should result in a wound 
surface area ≤ 50 mm2. The distance between the wounds was 5 cm. Abrasive wounds were created 
using a sterile scrub brush (such as MEDISCRUB) by trained study assistants. The skin areas were 
uniformly scrubbed using moderate pressure until the first signs of epidermal removal and punctuate 
bleeding were visible. The template was removed, and the 2 wounds were labelled as A and B using a 
skin marker. 
Each subject received treatment with control gel and petrolatum (1 treatment per wound area [A and 
B]) once daily for 16 days according to their randomly assigned treatment sequence. A non-adhesive 
wound dressing with a non-adherent pad was applied to each wound once a day until Day 10. The 
study was outcome assessor- blinded. Study personnel who administered the intervention and the 
subjects who received the interventions were not blinded. The Investigators who performed the wound 
assessments and standardised image analysis were blinded to treatment. To maintain the blind, the 
data manager, project manager and those preparing the analysis and results (programmers and 
statisticians) were blinded throughout the study until after database lock. 
Wound healing was assessed using clinical score, standardised photography, measurement of wound 
area, and clinical assessment of local tolerance from Day 1 through Day 16. Clinical assessment: A 6 
category clinical score was used to assess the degree of epithelialisation (0=0% [no healing], 1=1 to 
25% reepithelialisation, 2=26 to 50% reepithelialisation, 3=51 to 75% reepithelialisation, 4=>75% 
reepithelialisation, but not complete healing, 5=100% reepithelialisation [complete healing]). 
Planimetry assessment: For measurement of wound area, standardised photographs of each wound 
were taken; at least 2 photographs were taken at each timepoint, and the best image (after 
assessment for clarity and quality) was stored for subsequent image analysis. Wound healing 
measurements (planimetry) were performed by computerised image analysis using the software 
ImageJ. This was performed by 2 trained researchers/study assistants independently based on the 
Standard Operating Procedure for wound area measurement. The wound area was reported in mm2 
and the means of the 2 independent measurements were used. Complete wound healing was defined 
as a mean wound area of 0 mm2. 
Local tolerance was evaluated at every visit according to both the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 and the Grading System of Local Intolerance developed by the 
Clinical Research Center for Hair and Skin Science. AEs were monitored throughout the study from the 
time of informed consent through Day 23±2 days. 
Study population: It was planned to enroll 16 subjects (8 male and 8 female) aged 18 to 45 years, 
which allowed for an additional 3 subjects to compensate for possible subject withdrawals.  
Assessment report

Adult healthy volunteers (male or female) aged 18 to 45 years with skin Type II to III according to the 
Fitzpatrick classification were eligible for enrolment. Exclusion criteria included known or suspected 
defect of wound healing, any kind of skin barrier impairment, sunburn, or scars/tattoos/other skin 
signs that may have interfered with study procedures/measurements. Subjects who planned to 
undergo ultraviolet light sessions or sun exposure of the arms during the study were also excluded. 
Subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to 1 of the components of the investigational 
medicinal product or an allergy to the dressing to be used were not permitted to enroll in the study. 
Other exclusion criteria included: use of any treatment which may have affected blood coagulation and 
haemostasis, any physical treatment (like laser or surgery) on the arms in the 6 months prior to the 
study, use of topical or systemic treatments on the investigational areas within 4 weeks prior to the 
study, use of systemic antibiotics, systemic or topical steroids within 2 weeks of Day 1, and medical 
history of skin cancer. 
Treatments 
Test product=Control Gel. Ingredients: sunflower oil, beeswax yellow, carnauba wax. Applied topically 
once daily for 16 days at a thickness of approximately 1 mm (0.04 inch) over the wound area 
(diameter 8 mm to cover the wound edges). The treated areas were covered with a non-adhesive 
wound dressing with a non-adherent pad (Mepitel Border Lite) from Day 1 through Day 10 immediately 
after product application. 
Reference product = Petrolatum (ALLERGIKA – BASISSALBE). Ingredients per 100 g: white petrolatum 
95 g, liquid paraffin 5 g Applied topically once daily for 16 days at a thickness of approximately 1 mm 
(0.04 inch) over the wound area (diameter 8 mm to cover the wound edges). The treated areas were 
covered with a non-adhesive wound dressing with a non-adherent pad (Mepitel Border Lite) from Day 1 
through Day 10 immediately after product application. 
Duration of Treatment: 16 days (with a follow-up visit at day 23 +/-2 days). 
Endpoints 
Efficacy Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was days until complete healing of mechanically 
induced wounds in terms of complete re-epithelialisation (assessed by clinical score). Secondary 
efficacy endpoints were days until complete healing of mechanically induced wounds in terms of 
complete re-epithelialisation (assessed by planimetry), clinical score per day, and wound surface area 
in mm2 per day. 
Safety Endpoints: Secondary safety endpoints were incidence, severity, and causality of local tolerance 
AEs, and incidence, severity, and causality of all AEs. 
Statistical Methods 
The following analysis sets were used: 
• Enrolled Set: All subjects who provided informed consent irrespective of whether they received an 
application of study treatment. 
• All Randomised Subjects: All subjects who were assigned a randomisation number, irrespective of 
whether they received an application of study treatment. 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomised subjects who received at least 1 application of study 
treatment and who had at least 1 post baseline assessment of clinical scoring of wound healing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 101/162 
 
 
 
 
Subjects’ wounds were analysed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomisation, 
irrespective of the treatment they actually received. 
• Per-Protocol Set (PPS): A subset of the FAS that consisted of those subjects who did not have major 
protocol deviations considered to have a serious impact on the efficacy results. The PPS was used as 
the primary analysis set for the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary estimands. However, 
as the PPS and FAS contained identical subject assignments, the FAS was used as the primary analysis 
set. 
• Safety Analysis Set (SAF): All subjects who received at least 1 application of study treatment. 
Subjects’ wounds were analysed according to the treatment actually applied (if different from the 
randomised treatment). The SAF was used for analysis of safety and tolerability. 
The objective of the study was to demonstrate that the control gel was non inferior to petrolatum, 
based on the primary endpoint of days until complete healing assessed by clinical score. The primary 
estimand was mean difference in days until complete healing of 2 mechanically induced wounds in 
terms of complete re-epithelialisation (assessed by clinical score), regardless of the intercurrent events 
of treatment discontinuation or the assessment of re-epithelialisation being precluded. 
The null hypothesis was that the control gel was inferior to petrolatum (i.e., H0: Mean difference ≥ 
NIM) and the alternative hypothesis was that the control gel was non inferior to petrolatum (i.e., H1: 
Mean difference < NIM), where NIM was the non-inferiority margin which was equal to 1 day, and the 
difference corresponded to: Control gel petrolatum. 
All statistical tests were performed using a 1-sided 2.5% overall significance level and the comparison 
between the treatments was reported with 97.5% upper confidence limit for the difference. If the 
upper limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the NIM was less than 1 day, then non inferiority 
was demonstrated. The use of a 1-sided 97.5% confidence limit is equivalent to the use of a 1-sided 
test at the alpha=0.025 level of significance. 
For the primary analysis, a paired samples t test was utilised to conduct the non-inferiority test. This 
tested if the dependent variable of number of days to wound healing, measured for 2 different 
treatments (i.e., the 2 paired measurements) were significantly different. Summary estimates for each 
treatment with corresponding 95% 2-sided CIs and the difference between treatments with 
corresponding 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit, t-value and p-value were presented. The p-value 
was for the noninferiority test. If the 97.5% upper confidence limit was less than 1 day, then non-
inferiority had been demonstrated. This primary analysis was performed for the FAS only as the FAS 
and PPS contained identical subject assignments. 
For the secondary objective of days until complete healing of mechanically induced wounds in terms of 
complete re-epithelialisation (assessed by planimetry), the primary estimand was mean difference in 
days until complete healing of 2 mechanically induced wounds in terms of complete re-epithelialisation 
(assessed by planimetry), regardless of treatment discontinuation or the assessment of re-
epithelialisation being precluded. Complete wound healing was defined as a mean wound area of 0 
mm2. The number of days until complete healing (according to planimetry) was summarised and 
statistically analysed for mm2 only in the same manner as described for the primary endpoint. Mean 
wound area in mm2 and pixels were summarised by treatment group. The evaluation of each visit 
photography was performed by 2 independent assessors and the mean was used.

A total of 16 patients were randomised and all completed the study. Eight subjects were randomised to 
receive control gel on Wound A and petrolatum on Wound B, and 8 subjects were randomised to 
receive petrolatum on Wound A and control gel on Wound B. No major protocol deviations were 
reported. 
Eight male and 8 female subjects aged between 19 and 45 years were randomised and treated. All 
subjects had a Fitzpatrick skin phototype II or III as required by the protocol. None of the reported 
medical conditions or concomitant medications were considered likely to affect the conduct or results of 
the study. 
On Day 1 (following wound induction), mean wound surface area according to planimetry was similar 
for wounds treated with control gel and those treated with petrolatum (42.97 mm2 and 42.15 mm2, 
respectively). The degree of variability was high on day 1; wound surface areas ranged from 22.2 mm2 
to 65.5 mm2 across all wounds, and intra-subject-wound surface area difference was >10mm2 in 5 
subjects. 
Efficacy Results 
Primary Endpoint: Mean (standard deviation [SD]) days to complete wound healing assessed by clinical 
score were 14.2 (3.85) days for wounds treated with control gel and 12.5 (1.75) days for wounds 
treated with petrolatum. The null hypothesis that the control gel is inferior to petrolatum (mean 
difference ≥ the predefined NIM of 1 day) could not be rejected (upper limit of the 97.5% CI for the 
difference between treatments was 3.44 days). The maximum number of days to complete wound 
healing assessed by clinical score was longer for wounds treated with control gel (24 days) compared 
to those treated with petrolatum (16 days). Two wounds treated with control gel were assessed as not 
completely healed on Day 16; per protocol, the next assessment of wound healing was performed at 
the End of Study Visit (Day 23 ± 2 days). Both wounds were assessed as completely healed at the End 
of Study Visits. All wounds treated with petrolatum were assessed as completely healed by Day 16. 
Secondary Endpoints: Mean (SD) days to complete wound healing assessed by planimetry was 8.6 
(1.36) days for wounds treated with control gel and 8.9 (0.89) days for wounds treated with 
petrolatum. Control gel was confirmed to be non-inferior to petrolatum (upper limit of the 97.5% CI for 
the difference between treatments was <1 day [0.35 days]). The maximum number of days to 
complete wound healing assessed by planimetry was 11 days for both wounds treated with control gel 
and those treated with petrolatum. All wounds were considered completely healed as assessed by 
planimetry within 11 days following treatment with control gel or petrolatum. 
Safety results 
Six (37.5%) subjects experienced a total of 10 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) during the study. 
With the exception of a single report of moderate application site pruritus, all TEAEs were mild in 
severity. No TEAEs led to discontinuation of study treatment, and none were considered serious. 
Three (18.8%) subjects experienced a total of 6 TEAEs associated with the wound treated with control 
gel. These included application site pain (single event), application site pruritus (single event), and 
application site erosion (4 events described as scratching of wound site [2 events] and excoriation due 
to scratching [2 events]). With the exception of a single report of application site pruritus, all were 
considered to have a reasonable causal relationship to investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
No subjects experienced a TEAE associated with the wound treated with petrolatum. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 103/162 
 
 
 
 
The remaining 4 TEAEs reported were not associated with a wound area. One event of pruritus 
(itching) between the wounds was assessed as having a reasonable causal relationship to IMP. The 
other 3 events were assessed as having a non-reasonable causal relationship to IMP. 
No severe intolerance events were reported. The incidence of erythema, burning, pain, and exudate at 
the wound sites was low and all cases were mild with the exception of 1 report of moderate erythema 
at the End of Study Visit. The incidence of pruritus and desquamation was higher for wounds treated 
with control gel compared with wounds treated with petrolatum. However, the majority of occurrences 
were mild, and no severe cases were reported. 
In accordance with the CHMP advice/protocol assistance (PA) provided in 2018 
(EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/2/2018/PA/SME/II), a study was conducted to evaluate a potential 
detrimental effect of the BEB-13 control gel. In the original dossier, study AHV-A18 was included, 
however, this was stated to be an exploratory study, to be followed by a confirmatory study (AHV-
18-B). The applicant concluded that the results of study AHV-18-A indicated no differences in wound 
healing of mechanically induced partial-thickness wounds in healthy subjects between control gel, 
petrolatum, and no topical treatment (untreated). They claimed that this supported the use of the 
control gel as a blinded comparator for Oleogel-S10 in interventional clinical studies. However, this was 
just an exploratory study without any statistical hypothesis stated. According to the applicant, initiation 
of study AHV-18-B was delayed by a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic, however, upon request from 
the CHMP the final CSR was submitted. 
In the 2018 PA procedure, it was stressed that the study should have a clear test hypothesis 
(superiority, non-inferiority vs. no treatment) and be powered for this. It should not be just an 
exploratory study. Further, there should be a justification of the extrapolation of the results observed 
in the skin of healthy volunteers to the skin in patient with EB, taking aspects like wound area and 
treatment duration into account. It was however agreed that for several reasons, performing the study 
in EB patients would not be feasible. The Sponsor was asked to define in the protocol what will 
constitute ‘no difference in wound healing’ and 95% confidence intervals for the pairwise comparisons 
needed to be presented, not only the p-values, which are of less interest/value for the interpretation.  
It was also stated that the Sponsor needed to provide convincing arguments that the experimental 
wound study in healthy volunteers is sensitive enough to detect differences in wound healing. For 
instance, if the study can show that the petrolatum product is significantly superior to the untreated 
control and that the “placebo product” and petrolatum are similar, this can provide support for the 
notion that the vehicle used in the pivotal study will not have a detrimental effect on wound healing. 
Study AHV-18-B had a very similar design as the AHV-18-A study, but with a somewhat larger sample 
size (n=16 vs. n=12). In contrast to the AHV-18-A study, there was no untreated control wound in the 
AHV-18-B study. Also based on the final results, it could not be demonstrated that the control gel was 
non-inferior to petrolatum according to clinical score (primary endpoint). The study showed that the 
control gel was non-inferior to petrolatum according to planimetry score (secondary endpoint/ mean 
score from 2 independent assessors).  
Thus, it is concluded that based on the primary evaluation based on clinical assessment, the observed 
difference between the two treatments was 1.7 days, which is very similar to the magnitude of effect 
observed for the similar endpoint (time to first complete closure of the EB target wound by clinical 
assessment; median 92 days for Oleogel-S10 and 94 days for control gel, the first key secondary 
endpoint) in the pivotal EB study, i.e. 2 days. Hence, these results could not alleviate the concern that 
the difference observed for the primary endpoint in study BEB-13 could actually be due to an impaired 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 104/162 
 
 
 
 
wound healing caused by the control gel. In view of the modest beneficial effect perceived to be due to 
Oleogel-S10, this may at least in part contribute to the observed small difference between treatments.    
The applicant argued that although the evaluation of time to complete wound healing by clinical (naked 
eye) examination in the AHV-18-B study did not provide statistical evidence of non-inferiority using the 
pre-specified criteria, this observation was isolated as inconsistent with all others made in the same 
model (planimetry evaluations of wound healing in AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B, and clinical evaluations in 
AHV-18-A).  
In the Day 180 response, the applicant further discussed and tried to find reasons for study AHV-18-B 
not showing formal non-inferiority. For instance, some practical issues were experienced when 
inflicting the standardised wounds, i.e., that the templates used needed to be re-attached in some 
cases which may have resulted in different wound surface areas and thus high variability in baseline 
wound area size. In study AHV-18-B, there were two wounds per subject and not three as in the 
exploratory AHV-18-A study, in which a third wound was also inflicted but was left untreated. The 
applicant also discussed whether a comparison of two wounds in the 18-B study (‘best-in-two’) would 
be more likely to result in a worse outcome for one of the two as compared to a comparison of three 
wounds in the 18-A study (‘best-in-three’). For the latter, the claimed bias when comparing wounds 
side by side would be more diluted compared with the situation in the confirmatory 18-B study. The 
presence of two subjects in the 18-B study with wounds not healed by Day 16 based on clinical 
assessment (but assessed as healed with planimetry on Day 8 and 9, respectively) was also 
mentioned. Reasons for the planimetry assessment being more objective and reliable vs. the clinical 
assessment were also brought forward. These different factors may or may not have affected the 
outcomes.  
Study AHV-18-B was designed to be the confirmatory study, with an increased number of subjects and 
optimised design, e.g., with respect to frequency of evaluations, etc. Further, the applicant chose to 
have the clinical assessment and not the planimetry as the primary endpoint for non-inferiority 
assessment. Thus, even if potential reasons for not showing non-inferiority for the control gel vs. 
petrolatum in the primary clinical assessment are noted and acknowledged, it must still be noted that 
the study could not formally fulfil its aim; to ascertain that the BEB-13 control gel did not impact 
wound healing in a negative way.  
The applicant made a reference to the ‘mean time to complete closure of the target wound’ in the BEB-
13 study. However, when presenting these figures, only the figures for those achieving wound closure 
were used. This led to a complete target wound closure of 37.7 (21.65) days for Oleogel-S10 and 44.5 
(26.15) days (mean (SD)) for the control gel, thus, a difference of 6.8 days. This was misleading as it 
only included those subjects reaching wound closure. For the first key secondary endpoint in BEB-13 
(time to first complete closure of the EB target wound as evidenced by clinical assessment within 90 
days), the difference between the 2 treatment groups was not statistically significant (p=0.302). The 
median time to closure within 90 days was similar between treatment groups (92 days Oleogel-S10 
and 94 days control gel).  
Supportive external data  
As additional support, the applicant referred to a study with a different product, however, in a similar 
setting (randomised, vehicle-controlled study of a topical treatment in different EB subtypes). The aim 
was to provided support for the ‘natural history’ of wound healing in EB patients.  
In this study, no difference between the vehicle and active treatment could be demonstrated. 
However, the main purpose of referring to this study was to show a similar rate of wound closure with 
this vehicle as for the BEB-13 control gel. In this external study, the proportion of subjects who 
achieved the first target wound closure within 45 days on the vehicle was 24.05% and for the total 
population it was 27.15%. In BEB-13, 28.9% of subjects on control gel achieved complete wound

healing within D45. Nevertheless, between-study comparisons should be made with caution and no 
detailed display on differences or similarities in e.g., DEB/JEB distribution, age and co-morbidities was 
included. Still, the data may provide some support that the BEB-13 control gel behaved as expected 
and not obviously worse, although this study did not constitute a strong part of the justification for the 
control gel.  
Literature review 
The applicant has also provided a literature review aimed to support that ingredients in the control gel 
are not associated with negative effects on wound healing.  
A number of authorised topical products contain these excipients. According to the applicant, there was 
no evidence found for these products of a detrimental effect on wound healing.  
It was also referred to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well as healing properties of 
beeswax. For carnauba wax it was mentioned that a silk fibroin-based bi-layered wound dressing 
coated with carnauba wax was demonstrated to promote wound healing in full-thickness wounds with a 
greater extent of wound size reduction, epithelialisation, and collagen formation.  
A literature review on sunflower oil was also performed, based on which it was concluded that it was 
used as standard of care in paediatric skin care, as it enhanced skin hydration, skin barrier 
development, function, and recovery and reduced transepidermal water loss. The sunflower oil per se 
is however not at question here, since it is included in both Filsuvez and the control gel. 
Both beeswax and carnauba wax are present in topical medicinal products and are thus not unknown 
excipients. The applicant was also asked to provide any supporting literature data on the effects of 
topical products containing the same components as the control gel on wound healing, in general and 
in EB patients. This has been performed and a number of products and publications were referred to.  
The applicant concluded that none of the 11 yellow wax-containing products listed has been shown to 
have adverse effects on wound healing. For 3 products, no information regarding effects on wound 
healing could be identified. In 3 further products, the use on wounds was not recommended. It was 
stated that their respective SmPCs did not provide a detailed rationale, but the likely reason was to 
minimize systemic absorption through application of e.g., a potent corticosteroid on open wounds.  
The applicant made efforts to identify products containing the two waxes of interest, which is 
appreciated. The claimed lack of adverse effects on wound healing was complicated by several aspects. 
Firstly, a lack of reported negative effects on wound healing does not mean that there is none. 
Secondly, many products containing the waxes are products not indicated for use on open wounds, 
either because this is not the primary use or due to risk of adverse effects, e.g., systemic absorption of 
the active substance. Thirdly, when the waxes are used as excipients in topical products containing 
e.g., a topical corticosteroid, the effect of the steroid can mask potential negative effects, e.g. local 
irritant effects. Nevertheless, the applicant has fulfilled the requirement to compile literature data on 
the control gel components. Firm conclusions on lack of negative effects are difficult to draw from this 
data, although the presence of beeswax and carnauba wax in several topical medicinal products 
suggest that these components have no obvious harmful effects.  
A justification was also requested for the extrapolation of the results observed in the skin of healthy 
volunteers to the skin in patient with EB, taking aspects like wound area and treatment duration into 
account. This part of the question has rather limited relevance, since the pivotal HV study could not 
demonstrate non-inferiority for control gel vs. petrolatum. Hence, a conclusive ‘lack of negative effect’ 
cannot be extrapolated to EB patients. It was however acknowledged that healthy volunteers and not 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 106/162 
 
 
 
 
EB patients as a model for wound healing is preferred for the control gel assessment. While use of 
partial thickness wounds in healthy volunteers did remove the potential confounders seen in EB 
wounds, it may not be possible to extrapolate the results to patients with EB for that same reason. In 
addition, the size of wounds treated in the healthy volunteer studies versus the pivotal studies was 
different.  
Interestingly, the applicant also mentioned that “petrolatum (the ‘reference product’ in the healthy 
volunteer wound healing studies) has been widely used on PTWs of different aetiology including EB 
wounds for decades, even if there’s still no conclusive evidence of its effects on wound healing”. If 
petrolatum would have a demonstrated, indisputable positive effect on wound healing, a smaller effect 
of the BEB-13 control gel would not have been surprising. If on the other hand, petrolatum has a 
modest, inconclusive effect, the observed longer time to wound healing for the control gel would be 
more concerning. 
Overall, the applicant referred to the collective information from the literature review, the AHV-18-A 
results (clinical score and planimetry), the AHV-18-B planimetry results and the comparison with the 
ESSENCE study as evidence for the control gel not having a detrimental effect on wound healing.  
It is acknowledged that these different pieces of evidence suggested no existence of an obvious 
harmful effect of the control gel. The carefully designed confirmatory study AHV-18-B could not 
conclude on non-inferiority for the control gel vs. petrolatum for its primary endpoint. Some degree of 
uncertainty still exists; however, the applicant has made efforts to discuss and explain this issue to the 
extent possible and further data and/or justifications were not deemed necessary.  
Studies in partial-thickness wounds other than EB (Episalvan studies) 
The three studies in partial-thickness wounds (STSG donor site wound studies BSG-12 and BSH-12, 
and Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11) were assessed in depth in the Episalvan MAA. A summary of 
the main design elements can be found in Table 19.  
The study results are summarized in Table 19. In these three non-EB studies in subjects with STSGs 
and Grade 2a burn wounds, a global assessment of efficacy was performed by both investigators and 
subjects throughout treatment until the end of treatment (EoT) using a questionnaire. At the EoT, 
Oleogel-S10 was assessed as more effective or much more effective than control for the majority of 
subjects in both the investigator and subject assessments.

Statistically significant results in favour of Oleogel-S10 were demonstrated in the pivotal studies 
supporting the partial-thickness wound indication for Episalvan. The effect size was however not large 
with a difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves generally being one day. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy data supporting an EB indication for Filsuvez is the phase 3 study BEB-13, with 
some support also from a small phase 2 study in EB patients, BEB-10. In addition, the studies included 
in the submission for Episalvan in the indication Treatment of split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor 
site wounds were included in the dossier as supportive data. Furthermore, Phase 2 healthy subject 
studies with the control gel (AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B) were referred to in support of the EB 
application. 
No specific pharmacodynamic studies (ex vivo or in vivo) in EB patients have been performed to 
support a positive effect of Oleogel-S10 in the acceleration of wound healing in EB skin. The postulated 
beneficial effects relied on the assumption that wound healing processes were similar in skin of 
healthy, non-EB subjects and EB patients. The mechanism of action is thus more of a general support 
to achieve a faster wound healing rather than a specific mechanism of action targeting specific EB sub-
types. 
There is no European guideline available for medicinal products indicated for the treatment of wounds, 
including wounds associated with EB. 
The applicant overall followed the CHMP Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance received except in terms 
of dossier content. A number of issues were raised, in particular regarding the justification for the 
control gel used in the pivotal study. This is further discussed below.  
Study BEB-10 
Study BEB-10 was a very small (n=10) Phase 2 study of Oleogel-S10 in EB patients, seen as 
evaluation of proof-of-concept in this target population. The study had an intra-individual comparative 
design, commonly seen in early, explorative studies for locally applied dermatological products. The 
control treatment was the standard dressing only and not another applied gel or ointment 
(placebo/vehicle). The study was conducted open-label, with blinded assessment of efficacy by 2 
independent experts based on photographs. The analyses of this study had methodological flaws as it 
favoured the IMP with limited justification, in case the two reviewers disagreed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 109/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study BEB-10 did not include dose finding and no other dose finding study has been performed for 
Filsuvez/Oleogel-S10 in the EB indication. Since the effect is local, PK/PD modelling is not applicable. 
The applicant was of the view that a clinical dose-finding study was not performed because lower or 
higher concentrations of the drug substance would have negatively impacted the characteristics of the 
gel. This is acknowledged. In the Episalvan EPAR, it was also concluded that no conventional dose-
response studies were performed and the CHMP considered that the provided information was 
sufficient for the selection of the chosen concentration. The same concentration (10%) and formulation 
is used in both products. Therefore, there was no issue raised by the CHMP related to the dose finding.  
Study BEB-13 
Study design 
This was a randomised, controlled, 90-day double-blind phase 3 study, with a 24-month open-label 
follow-up of Oleogel-S10 in subjects with inherited EB. Each subject was to participate for 90 days in 
the randomised DBP. At the end of the DBP (Day 90), subjects in both treatment arms were invited to 
enter the single-arm OLP with Oleogel-S10 treatment of all wounds for 24 months.  
Study population  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were overall found acceptable and were endorsed by the CHMP in 
scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/2011/PA/III and EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III). 
Following a protocol amendment, patients with the milder EB subtype EBS (EB Simplex) were not to be 
included. This is acknowledged and the proposed indication wording does not include EBS. 
It was not stated in the inclusion criteria how the EB diagnosis should have been confirmed, e.g., if 
genetic testing was needed or if immunofluorescence mapping or electron microscopy or a clinical EB 
diagnosis only would suffice. This is further discussed below. 
A target wound was defined as having a size 10 cm2 to 50 cm2, aged ≥21 days but less than 9 months, 
and should be present outside of the anogenital region. This is endorsed. Following discussions in the 
CHMP Protocol assistance in 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III), an upper size limit of 
50 cm2 was set. The target wound should not have clinical signs of local infection. An upper age limit of 
9 months for the target wound was included following an amendment. 
The study had broad age inclusion criteria; subjects from the age of 21 days could be included. The 
inclusion of children below 4 years of age was only made after confirmation by the IDMC upon review 
of the safety and PK (betulin levels) data at the interim safety review. This approach is reasonable, and 
the inclusion of children and infants is relevant due to the unmet need also in this group of EB patients. 
Treatments 
The subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either Oleogel-S10 or control gel respectively on top of 
the standard of care (non-adhesive wound dressing). The control gel used in this study was not the gel 
vehicle without the active substance (the extract). Due to the galenical properties, with the betulin 
extract and sunflower oil forming an ‘oleogel’, it was not possible to use the gel vehicle in this case, 
i.e., pure sunflower oil (with different viscosity etc. vs the active product). Therefore, a dedicated 
‘control gel’ was developed and used in the study. This approach was extensively discussed in the 
scientific advice procedures (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III, 
EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/2/2018/PA/SME/II). There was a concern that in case a beneficial effect of the 
active treatment (Oleogel-S10) was observed, sufficient reassurance would be needed to establish that 
this was not merely due to a detrimental effect on wound healing caused by the ‘control gel’. To 
overcome this concern, the applicant conducted study AHV18-A and subsequently study AHV18-B (see 
below). 
Oleogel-S10 or the control gel were applied on the EB target wound and also to all areas on the 
subject’s body that were affected by EB partial-thickness wounds. No maximum body surface area to 
be covered was specified in the protocol.  
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 110/162 
 
 
 
 
The attempts to standardise the type of wound dressings to be used, to the extent possible in a global 
study, was acknowledged. However, some subjects still used Vaseline gauze or other dressings 
containing topical emollients, although these were not permitted per the protocol. A subgroup analysis 
of these subjects was performed and is discussed below. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of the DBP was to compare the efficacy of Oleogel-S10 with vehicle (control gel) 
in the promotion of healing of EB partial-thickness wounds. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the DBP was the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of 
the EB target wound in subjects with inherited EB within 45 days of treatment with Oleogel-S10 
compared with control gel based on clinical assessment by the investigator (the wound was to be rated 
as “closed” at first appearance of complete re-epithelialisation without drainage). The choice of this 
endpoint was discussed and agreed in the CHMP protocol assistance in 2017 
(EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III). Assessing the proportion of patients achieving wound 
closure within a period of 45 days, rather than time to first wound closure within 90 days was found 
adequate. In addition, the time point 45 days was preferred to the initially proposed 60 days, since 
assessment at an earlier time point would be relevant to address acceleration of wound healing.  
A re-opening of a closed target wound is however also of great interest since EB skin is very fragile and 
a benefit of a healed wound would be larger if the healing is sustained. This was discussed in the PA 
procedure (EMEA/H/SA/2179/1/FU/1/2016/PA/SME/III) and it was considered that the incidence of re-
injury of the target wound should be reported. Confirmation of complete closure was assessed by a site 
study team member (e.g., study nurse) at home 7 days (±2 days) after first clinical assessment of 
complete closure of the EB target wound. This was assessed in a supportive analysis. 
A large number of secondary endpoints have been evaluated, six of them being classified as key 
secondary efficacy endpoints and included in the multiple testing procedure. If the primary analysis of 
the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrated superiority at the 5% significance level, hierarchical 
confirmatory testing of the 6 key secondary endpoints was planned on the FAS. These endpoints reflect 
other aspects of wound healing, the incidence and severity of wound infections, change from baseline 
in total body wound burden (TBWB) and change from baseline in itching. In addition to the key 
secondary endpoints a range of other secondary endpoints were also evaluated, e.g., addressing 
“procedural” pain and “background” pain, evaluating target wound closure at other time points, TBWB, 
change from baseline in body surface area percentage affected by EB partial-thickness wounds and 
itch. These were considered as relevant efficacy endpoints in an EB study. 
Randomisation and blinding 
A 1:1 randomisation to Oleogel-S10 or control gel was used, stratified for EB subtype and size of target 
wound (cm2) in six different strata. The stratification factors were considered adequate. The sample 
size was increased following an unblinded sample size re-estimation. This was pre-planned and 
described in detail in the SAP and the final analysis was adequately adjusted. 
Adequate procedures and measures have been taken to ensure blinding. As described above, using the 
pure vehicle (sunflower oil) was not considered possible in this case due to different galenic properties, 
e.g., viscosity, that would have led to unblinding. Nevertheless, the use of a different ‘control gel’ can 
impact the interpretation of a difference observed between treatment arms. This is discussed further 
below in relation to the assessment of the supportive studies AHV-18-A and AHV18-B. 
Statistical analysis 
The primary endpoint was analysed with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by EB subtype 
and target wound size class. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint used the Cui, Hung, Wang 
(CHW) approach to adjust the estimates provided by the CMH test for the sample size re-estimation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 111/162 
 
 
 
 
Concerns were raised related to the type I error control using this approach, however adequate 
justification for using this method has been provided. 
Missing data was imputed as failures in the primary analysis. Since more subjects discontinued the 
double-blind phase in the control treatment group than in the Oleogel-S10 treatment group this was 
not considered to be a conservative approach for the treatment comparison. Hence the sensitivity 
analyses were of importance. Of particular interest for assessing the robustness of the results was the 
tipping point analysis challenging the MAR assumption (see further below). 
Study AHV-18-A 
This was an exploratory, randomised, intrasubject-controlled study of the cutaneous healing properties 
of petrolatum versus the control gel for Oleogel-S10 (used in BEB-13) versus no treatment, when 
applied topically to mechanically induced partial-thickness wounds in 12 healthy adult subjects. The 
results from this study were to be used to inform the design of a confirmatory, Phase 2 study (Study 
AHV-18-B), including calculation of an appropriate sample size. Randomised subjects had 3 abrasive 
wounds (created using a sterile scrub brush) of approximately 8 mm diameter in 3 mini-zones and the 
three wounds were treated with either of the three treatments, randomly assigned.  
The primary efficacy endpoints were days until complete healing according to clinical score and days 
until complete healing according to planimetry. Secondary efficacy endpoints were mean clinical score 
per day, mean wound surface area in mm2, and mean TEWL per wound. 
This was an exploratory study; hence, only descriptive statistical methods were applied, treatments 
were not compared using a statistical test; no null hypotheses were tested. 
Study AHV-18-B 
This study had a very similar design as study AHV-18-A, but it did not include an untreated wound 
area, only a comparison of the control gel vs. petrolatum. The sample size was larger compared with 
AHV-18-A (n=16 vs. n=12).  
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the control gel was non-inferior to petrolatum with 
regards to time to achieve cutaneous healing of mechanically induced partial thickness wounds in 
healthy volunteers.  The primary efficacy endpoint was days until complete healing of mechanically 
induced wounds in terms of complete re-epithelialisation assessed by clinical score. The first secondary 
efficacy endpoint was days until complete healing of mechanically induced wounds in terms of 
complete re-epithelialisation assessed by planimetry. A non-inferiority margin of 1 day was used. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study BEB-10 
In the comparison of wound halves, Oleogel-S10 showed the majority of positive results whereas the 
‘non-adhesive wound dressing’ alone was found the best in only two instances (with conflicting results 
between the reviewers for those). The efficacy results from this very small, intra-patient, open-label 
(but reviewer-blinded) study were not strong and provided limited support for a proof-of-concept and 
beneficial effects of Oleogel-S10 in the re-epithelialisation of EB wounds. The majority of patients had 
RDEB. The open label nature was considered a limitation and there were flaws in the applicant’s 
interpretation/presentation of the efficacy results for the primary endpoint. The study may have 
benefitted from three blinded experts assessing the wounds to lessen ambiguity regarding efficacy 
results. In any case, the results seen for the primary, key and other secondary endpoints were not 
overly compelling and thus are considered to provide limited support for this application. 
Study BEB-13 
A total of 252 subjects were screened and of these, 223 subjects were randomised to Oleogel-S10 
(N=109) or control gel (N=114). Randomised subjects were enrolled across 49 sites in 26 countries 
and geographic regions, including the US, Europe, South America, and Rest of World. Overall, 199 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 112/162 
 
 
 
 
(89%) subjects completed the DBP of the study (92%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 87%, control gel), and 24 
(11%) subjects discontinued. Thus, the rate of completion in the double-blind part of the study was 
high. The most common reasons for discontinuation were reasons classified as Other and withdrawal of 
consent. Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided updated data from the OLP. The final 
CSR will be submitted once available (i.e., by Q1 2023). 
There were several amendments to the protocol. These included for instance exclusion of subjects with 
EB Simplex, sample size re-estimations, definition of the EB target wound and clarification of the 
primary endpoint (confirmation of closure no longer required). More than 60% of the subjects overall 
had at least one major protocol deviation during the DBP of the study. The major reasons were related 
to the investigational product (e.g., non-compliance with administration regimen), use of prohibited 
concomitant treatment / prohibited dressings or due to missed visits / visits outside window.  
Wound dressings that were prohibited according to the protocol were used in a large proportion of 
subjects. These included both dressings with emollients and in some cases also dressings containing an 
active ingredient, e.g., silver or PHMB. It was finally decided that non-permitted dressings were to be 
considered as minor protocol deviations for defining the PPS. The use of prohibited wound dressings 
occurred in both treatment arms (31 Oleogel-S10 vs. 37 control gel). A subgroup analysis has been 
performed, see below. The use of prohibited dressing occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the 
control arm versus the treatment arm. The applicant has provided further detail on the underlying EB 
type that this occurred in or whether it was for all EB subtypes and also provided a further analysis on 
the primary and key secondary endpoints removing these patients. No concerns regarding the impact 
of the above findings on the study results remain based on the additional data provided. 
Compliance, defined as actual treatment duration in days / treatment duration in days * 100, was high 
in both treatment arms, being >98%. 
Overall, the demographics were well balanced between the two treatment groups. 60% of subjects 
were male and 40% were female. The median age was 12 years (range 6 months to 81 years). Divided 
by age categories, 8% of subjects were 0 to <4 years of age, 38% were 4 to <12 years, 24% were 12 
to <18 years, and 30% were ≥18 years of age. Of the 67 subjects who were ≥18 years of age, 3 
subjects were 65 years of age or older. Thus, the majority of subjects were in the age range 4-12 
years and very few subjects were elderly (only three aged above 65 years). This reflected a population 
with severe EB, i.e., that the condition was present from birth and that many EB patients with severe 
forms like DEB or JEB have a limited life span.  
The majority (>80%) of subjects were White. Geographic regions in which subjects were enrolled 
included Europe (46%), South America (30.5%), Rest of World (17%), and the US (6%). 
The mean BMI of subjects was 16.2 kg/m2. Approximately half (52%) of subjects were underweight; 
39% had normal weight; 5% were overweight; and 5% were obese. This also reflected a severely 
affected EB population, where many patients have nutritional problems. 
In the Safety Analysis Set, 87% subjects had the EB subtype of DEB; of these, 175 (78.5%) subjects 
had RDEB and 20 (9%) subjects had DDEB. Twenty-six (11.7%) subjects had JEB. Two (0.9%) 
subjects had EBS, since with implementation of Version 4.0 of the protocol, subjects with EBS were 
excluded from study participation. None of the subjects had Kindler syndrome. 
EB subtype identification was based on genetic testing in 129 (57.8%) subjects, clinical diagnosis only 
in 49 (22.0%) subjects, immunofluorescence mapping or electron microscopy in 41 (18.4%) subjects, 
and method classified as Other in 4 (1.8%) subjects.  
Justifications for clinical diagnosis only was requested. The applicant clarified that additional subjects 
had or were planned to undergo genetic testing prior to final database lock. It was anticipated that for 
the final CSR, the proportion of subjects with clinical diagnosis only will be reduced to approximately 
12%, which is acknowledged by the CHMP. It was also noted that according to both previous and 
current EB consensus, classification of inherited EB is still primarily clinically oriented, as the EB 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 113/162 
 
 
 
 
classification is complex. It is acknowledged that a specific diagnosis of EB subtype can be challenging, 
and it is agreed that the risk of misdiagnosis or misclassification is low. Hence, for a topical treatment 
which is not specifically developed to target specific mutations causing EB, it does not seem critical to 
require genetic confirmation prior to initiation of treatment in the SmPC. Based on this, a requirement 
for restricted medical prescription is also not considered warranted. 
The DEB and JEB disease subtypes and methods of diagnosis were generally well balanced between the 
2 treatment groups. However, within the DEB subtype, the Oleogel-S10 group had a higher proportion 
of subjects with RDEB compared to the control gel (83.5%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 73.7%, control) and a 
lower proportion of subjects with DDEB (5.5%, Oleogel-S10 vs. 12.3%, control). 
Concerning the target wound characteristics, the majority (65%) of subjects had a target wound 
between 10 to <20 cm2; 21% between 20 to <30 cm2, and 14% between 30 to 50 cm2. The median 
wound size was about 16 cm2. The overall median wound age was 35.5 days. The target wounds were 
most commonly located on the lower leg (20%), knee (13.5%), and thigh (13.5%).  
The target wound size was well balanced between the treatment groups; however, the median wound 
age was slightly greater in the Oleogel-S10 group (39 days, Oleogel-S10 vs. 32 days, control gel). It 
was not fully clear how large body surface area in total that was treated, but clarification has been 
provided in a safety question and relevant information was adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.1. 
Comorbidities observed (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, skin 
disorders other than EB, metabolism and nutrition disorders, infections) were those generally 
anticipated in subjects with EB and were related to the disease and its complications. Medical and 
surgical histories were generally well balanced between the treatment groups, with some imbalances in 
pruritus and pain. Prior and concomitant medication use were overall well balanced between treatment 
groups.  
All of the randomised subjects (N=223) were included in the Safety Analysis Set and the FAS; 185 
(83%) subjects were included in the PPS (84.4% Oleogel-S10 vs. 81.6% subjects, control). 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint was met as the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the 
EB target wound within 45 days of initiating treatment was higher in the Oleogel-S10 group (41.3%) 
compared to the control gel group (28.9%). This finding was statistically significant in favour of 
Oleogel-S10 based on the CHW method using the CMH test statistics (p=0.013) and based on the 
unadjusted CMH test (p=0.041). The difference between treatments was considered by the CHMP to be 
small (12.4 % units) and the results were not of high statistical significance (SmPC section 5.1). 
Results for the PPS population did not reach statistical significance (p=0.151) even if the magnitude of 
the difference was almost similar to the FAS. 
Since the primary analysis used a non-responder imputation for missing data and the amount of 
missing data was larger in the control treatment group than in the Oleogel-S10 treatment group this 
was not considered a sufficiently conservative analysis. The tipping point analysis described in the SAP 
using multiple imputation (MI) was considered of particular interest. The MI analysis without tipping 
gave borderline significant results and switching the result for only one control patient resulted in a 
non-significant p-value. Hence, the robustness of the results was initially questioned, and a discussion 
was requested by the CHMP.  
Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant provided further information on amount of missing data at 
the day 45 visit arguing that the amount and reasons of missing data was similar in the two treatment 
groups. This wa agreed to by the CHMP. However, this is no guarantee that data are Missing at 
Random (MAR). The CHMP was of the view that there could still be mechanisms deviating from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 114/162 
 
 
 
 
MAR assumption that would create bias in the comparison. Hence, the tipping point analysis evaluating 
robustness to any such bias was still considered important. 
The applicant argued that the CMH (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel) test did not work well with small strata 
and has provided post hoc analyses combining or removing the three JEB/Kindler strata. In those 
analyses the p-value was slightly smaller and switching one subject did not yield non-significant results 
(however switching two subjects did). The applicant hence considered that the primary analysis was 
robust and driven by the largest cohort, namely the dystrophic EB subtype. This was not agreed by the 
CHMP. Those analyses were performed post-hoc and were not prespecified in the SAP. A major 
objection was therefore raised by the CHMP regarding the robustness of the results for the primary 
endpoint. 
Further justifications for the robustness of results were presented by the applicant. Based on the 
response provided, it can be agreed that the results for the primary endpoint (which used the clinical 
assessment of the target wound by the investigator) and an assessment using standardised 
photographs (evaluated by an independent blinded expert panel) were consistent. The effect size was 
also similar, with a difference of 12.4% units (Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel) for the primary endpoint 
and 13.2% units for the blinded expert panel photo evaluation. 
To try to strengthen the evidence from the primary analysis the applicant has gone through subjects 
with missing data in the primary endpoint and discussed whether each subject could have been a 
responder. Since this subject-by-subject evaluation was performed post hoc on fully unblinded results 
and was not conclusive in its result it was not considered to add any information to the assessment. 
The fact pointed out by the applicant that the tipping point analysis was performed with the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and not the Cui-Hung-Wang (CHW) test used for the primary analysis was 
also not considered to weaken the tipping point analysis. The fact remained, the primary analysis was 
statistically significant with a p-value of 0.013, however, most sensitivity analyses were not statistically 
significant, and the tipping point analysis showed that changing the result of one single patient gave a 
non-significant result. Nevertheless, at the oral explanation and upon request by the CHMP, the 
applicant presented results of the primary efficacy analysis switching this one single patient from non-
responder to responder using the CHW methodology. In contrast to the tipping point analysis 
performed with the CMH test, this analysis demonstrated that the p-value remained statistically 
significant (i.e., p-value=0.021). The CHMP was therefore of the view that the results for the primary 
endpoint can be considered as robust from a statistical viewpoint.  
The applicant also referred to the importance of evaluation of both complete wound closure and 
reduction in wound size as key efficacy measures and that there can be a benefit even if a wound has 
not yet achieved one hundred percent wound closure at time of evaluation for EB patients. 
The target wound showed a reduction in size in both treatment groups from a mean of 19.14 cm2 at 
baseline to 7.65 cm2 by Day 45 -11.49 cm2 for Oleogel-S10, compared to a reduction from 19.6 cm2 at 
baseline to 9.26 cm2 by Day 45 -10.34 cm2 for the control gel arm. For a comparison of the mean 
AUCs using a two-sided two-sample t-test, the Oleogel-S10 mean was significantly lower than the 
control mean (p=0.017). It should be noted that this was not the analysis pre-planned and reported in 
the study report. Analyses presented in the study report did not show statistically significant treatment 
difference. Furthermore, this was not a multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoint, hence the p-value 
must be seen as ‘nominal’. Also, the difference between treatments was overall considered to be small 
by the CHMP; the difference in change from baseline in mean wound size at Day 45 was 1.15 cm2. 
For the presentation based on stratification factors, the DEB strata showed higher rates of wound 
closure for Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel across wound size. In the largest stratification group of 128 
subjects (DEB 10 to <20 cm2), the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB target 
wound within 45 days of treatment was higher in the Oleogel-S10 group (54.8%) compared to the 
control gel group (39.4%). In the second largest stratification group of 43 subjects (DEB 20 to <30 
cm2), these proportions were 27.3% and 9.5%, respectively; a similar trend was observed for subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 115/162 
 
 
 
 
 
  
with DEB 30 to 50 cm2 (21.4% and 8.3%, respectively). For the JEB/Kindler sub-types, however, the 
patient numbers were much smaller (n=26 in total; no subject in BEB-13 had Kindler syndrome) and 
conclusions were difficult to make.  
In a sensitivity analysis, results for the primary endpoint was assessed based on confirmed, sustained 
healing of the target wound, at 7 days after the first healing was observed. This resulted in fewer 
subjects rated as ‘success’ for both groups, with 17.4% achieving confirmed closure in the Oleogel-S10 
group vs. 8.8% in the control group. This difference was borderline significant (p=0.048). 
Secondary endpoints 
The applicant had defined six ‘key’ secondary endpoints of the total 18 secondary endpoints in the 
protocol. The results for the first key secondary endpoint were not statistically significant, hence, the 
results for the key secondary endpoints were not confirmatory. The p-values reported for other 
analyses of the key secondary endpoints were not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Regarding the first key secondary endpoint, the median time to closure was similar between treatment 
groups (92 days Oleogel-S10 and 94 days control gel) and the difference was not statistically 
significant (p=0.302).  
The second key secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the 
EB target wound within 90 days of treatment based on clinical assessment by the investigator. A 
higher proportion of subjects in the Oleogel-S10 group (50.5%) achieved first EB target wound closure 
than subjects in the control gel group (43.9%) by Day 90, however, the difference was not statistically 
significant (p=0.296). 
Two subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 (1.8%; actually 1 based on a misclassification, thus 0.9%) 
experienced a target wound infection between baseline and Day 90 compared with five subjects 
treated with control gel (4.4%). Overall, the number of wound infections was low and no statistically 
significant treatment difference was observed. The same applied to infections in non-target wounds. 
Not much could be said about the severity of wound infections; the infection reported by the 1 subject 
who received Oleogel-S10 was classified as mild. Overall, the CHMP considered that the rates were too 
low to assess whether there was a difference between Oleogel-S10 and control gel.  
For pain, which can be of great importance in EB, (denoted as an additional secondary endpoint), some 
mean improvements that were greater in the Oleogel-S10 group compared to the control gel group 
were observed, mainly for procedural pain with a statistically significant difference in favour of Oleogel-
S10 at Day 14 (nominal p-value 0.022) and also a larger difference at Day 90 (nominal p-value 0.051). 
However, the differences between treatments were very small.  
For endpoints relating to sleep, number of days missed from school or work due to EB and overall 
treatment satisfaction, no clear beneficial effects of Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel could be observed. 
Thus, no formally demonstrated positive effects on wound infections, total body wound burden, itch, 
pain or sleep can be claimed for Filsuvez. 
In order to address the CHMP’s concerns regarding the clinical relevance of the effects seen with 
Filsuvez to patients and carers of EB patients, further argumentation was provided by the applicant.  
One new aspect was a review of subjects who had daily dressing changes at baseline, which showed 
that the proportion who had reduced frequency at subsequent visits was larger in the Oleogel-S10 arm 
than in the control gel arm. At Day 90/end of DBP, 14.7% of subjects on Oleogel-S10 no longer 
required daily dressings compared to 6.1% of subjects on control gel. Although the difference between 
treatments was considered to be small by the CHMP and this was not a formal endpoint in the study, 
this may be of benefit since changing dressings in EB patients is time consuming and painful. However, 
these analyses were not pre-planned, and as such were considered by the CHMP of limited value for 
the present application.  
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 116/162 
 
 
 
 
The applicant also referred to testimonies from the EB patient community and an EB expert statement. 
These statements and testimonies were acknowledged, and it is understandable that in a condition like 
EB, there is a tolerance towards a degree of uncertainty for a treatment benefit and also an acceptance 
of a higher level of risk for even the chance of a potential benefit. The benefits of a local treatment 
without systemic risks and without need for check-ups was also referred to. The applicant also 
provided information from the use of Oleogel-S10 via ‘Temporary Authorisation for Use’ (ATU) in 
France. Between 25 August 2020 and 06 October 2021, 31 patients at 5 sites have been granted 
access to Oleogel-S10 within the ATU, the majority being children (74%) and with the subtype RDEB 
(74%). The youngest participant is less than 1 year old. In terms of safety data from the ongoing ATU, 
as of 23 Nov 2021, 4 of the 31 subjects enrolled had discontinued the ATU prematurely of which 2 
discontinued due to AEs, but in general, the product was well tolerated. These data were noted but did 
not provide further support for the effect of Oleogel-S10. 
To conclude on the results from secondary endpoints in study BEB-13, even if there was largely a 
consistency in the direction of improvement, the differences between Oleogel-S10 and control gel were 
very modest. It is acknowledged that in rare diseases, secondary endpoints may not be powered for 
formal statistical testing. It was unclear if the minor differences compared to control with respect to 
total wound burden, itch and pain are clinically meaningful. At the AHEG meeting, it was however 
confirmed by both physicians treating EB patients and by EB patients/caregivers that any effect, no 
matter how small, would be of clinical benefit in this condition.  
Overall, even if the statistical robustness of the analysis of the primary endpoint has been questioned 
during the procedure, the CHMP is of the view, in line with the recommendation of the AHEG, that an 
effect of Filsuvez has been established in the overall study population considering that some of the 
sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. This effect was also 
considered to be clinically relevant for the EB patients and carers.  
Sub-group results 
With respect to EB subtypes, there was a large difference in the numbers included with different 
subtypes, with the RDEB subtype group being largest (n=175 subjects), while the DDEB (n=20 
subjects) and JEB subtype groups (n=26 subjects) were much smaller. This is likely a reason for 
differing results for the primary endpoint, where an effect could be shown for the RDEB group (44.0% 
vs. 26.2%, respectively; CMH p=0.008), but not for the two other subtypes (same rates of closure in 
both groups for DDEB and higher rate of closure for control gel vs. Oleogel-S10 for JEB). There were 
some imbalances in numbers randomised to Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel and also imbalances with 
respect to wound size and age, that may have contributed. The applicant initially proposed an 
indication covering both dystrophic and junctional EB, which was questioned on the basis of these 
results. It was acknowledged that due to the even higher rarity of the DDEB and JEB sub-types, it may 
not be realistic to recruit enough patients to enable a demonstration of statistically significant effect 
within each sub-type. However, especially in JEB, the results were still deemed questionable as this EB 
subtype has large heterogeneity in severity and presentation. In an attempt to address the CHMP’s 
concerns, the applicant initially proposed to remove the JEB subgroup from the indication based on a 
sub-group analysis only on the RDEB subject population. However, in the new subgroup analysis, the 
DEB subgroup did not include the DDEB sub-type even if the revised proposed indication included both 
RDEB and DDEB, which was questioned by the CHMP. 
It is agreed that the presented subgroup analysis for the RDEB sub-population had a larger treatment 
effect and a stronger significance level (nominal p-value) than the analysis of the FAS dataset as 
pointed out by the applicant. Since the presented sub-group analysis was considered post-hoc and 
data-driven, it was not accepted as confirmatory evidence of efficacy by the CHMP.  
At the AHEG meeting, the experts considered that one cannot infer that a drug that works in DEB 
would work in JEB as well, while the patients’ representatives considered that any drug that overall 
works in EB would be considered as important for the EB patients. It was finally considered acceptable 
by the CHMP to include also the JEB subtype in the indication given the demonstrated effect of Filsuvez 
Assessment report

in the overall study population (i.e., DEB and JEB) and the unspecific mechanism of action which does 
not target specific EB sub-types. However, a cautionary statement was included in SmPC section 4.4 
clarifying the limited data available in the JEB and DDEB subtypes.  
With respect to age, the largest part of the study population was aged below 18 years with the largest 
sub-group being those aged 4 to <12 years, comprising 38% overall. The subgroup 0 - <4 years was 
very small (n=17 in total, <8% of the total population). In the 4 to <12 years age subgroup, the most 
pronounced difference between treatments in favour of Oleogel-S10 was observed. Results for the 
other age groups below 18 years were numerically in favour of Oleogel-S10 while this was not the case 
for patients aged ≥ 18 years (odds ratio and 95% CI 0.86, 0.31; 2.43). Hence, the youngest age 
group (0-<4 years) was very small and for the oldest age group (≥18 years, i.e., adults) the results 
were not in favour of Oleogel-S10. The applicant was asked to discuss and justify the applied indication 
covering all ages.  
The age distribution in the 0-<4 years group has been presented and there were no Oleogel-S10-
treated subjects aged 6-11 months (2 in the control arm), 3 were aged 12-17 months, 3 were aged 2 
years and one was aged 3 years. Thus, no patient < 1 year was exposed to Oleogel-S10. From an 
efficacy perspective, the applicant presented the results for the primary endpoint in the ≥21 days and 
<4 years subgroup and 71% reached closure in the Oleogel-S10 group vs. 40% in the control group. 
This was however based on very small numbers. No firm conclusions can be made regarding 
procedural pain assessed by the FLACC pain score. The applicant also referred to safety results, 
showing no major concerns in comparison with the overall study population, but again, the small 
numbers made conclusions difficult. Efficacy-wise, there seems to be no reason to expect a different 
response with Oleogel-S10 in the youngest, compared with older children, adolescents and adults. The 
treatment is topical and thus a need for a specific systemic exposure to achieve an effect is not 
relevant. Nevertheless, from a safety viewpoint, considering the very limited data in the youngest age 
group, an indication from birth onwards was not supported by the CHMP and a lower age limit of 6 
months has been introduced by the applicant. See section 2.6.9 discussion on clinical safety.  
Concerning adults, there is no obvious reason to exclude adult EB patients from the indication (even if 
a subgroup analysis did not show favourable results for Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel). Even if there 
were very few EB patients aged >65 years (n=3), an upper age limit does not seem warranted based 
on efficacy (or safety).  
Regardless of target wound size and gender, the results tended to favour Oleogel-S10.  
Concerning permitted vs. non-permitted contact layer/dressings, subjects treated with Oleogel-S10 
were more likely to achieve the primary endpoint than subjects who received control gel regardless of 
whether a permitted contact layer/dressing was used. Further analyses and clarifications have been 
provided and no issues remained. 
Results with respect to race are difficult to make since 83.4% of subjects were White.  
No obvious differences in effect for Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel were observed for the factors baseline 
nutritional status, anemia and renal function (although in the third tertile, having normal albumin 
levels, a higher proportion of subjects who received control gel achieved the primary endpoint than 
subjects who received Oleogel-S10).  
In the CHMP scientific advice, CHMP recommended considering seasonal change as the disease course 
and severity of EB may differ with season. The applicant was asked to address this, e.g., describe 
which season(s) the DBP was performed in and whether there were differences between the two 
treatment groups, and a discussion on a potential impact on the results. This has been provided; few 
patients were included during summertime (13-14% of subjects in each arm) and no concerns were 
raised.

Concerns related to the control gel in study BEB-13 
Study AHV-18-A 
Mean days to complete wound healing according to planimetry were similar for all treatments (10.6 
days for untreated wounds and wounds treated with control gel and 10.5 days for wounds treated with 
petrolatum). All wounds were considered healed according to planimetry by Day 13. The applicant 
thereby concluded that the results of study AHV-18-A indicated no differences in wound healing of 
mechanically induced partial-thickness wounds in healthy subjects between control gel, petrolatum, 
and no topical treatment (untreated). The applicant claimed that this supported the use of the control 
gel as a blinded comparator for Oleogel-S10 in interventional clinical studies. However, this was an 
exploratory study without any statistical hypothesis stated.  
In the 2018 PA procedure, it was stressed that the study should have a clear test hypothesis 
(superiority, non-inferiority vs. no treatment) and be powered for this and thus not be an exploratory 
study. Further, there should be a justification for the extrapolation of the results observed in the skin 
of healthy volunteers to the skin in patient with EB, taking aspects like wound area and treatment 
duration into account. It was however agreed that for several reasons, performing the study in EB 
patients would not be feasible. The Sponsor was asked to define in the protocol what will constitute ‘no 
difference in wound healing’ and 95% confidence intervals for the pairwise comparisons needed to be 
presented, not only the p-values, which are of less interest/value for the interpretation.  
It was stated that in a MAA, the Sponsor needed to provide convincing arguments that the 
experimental wound study in healthy volunteers was sensitive enough to detect differences in wound 
healing. For instance, if the study can show that the petrolatum product was significantly superior to 
the untreated control and that the “placebo product” and petrolatum were similar, this can provide 
support for the notion that the vehicle used in the pivotal study will not have a detrimental effect on 
wound healing. 
Study AHV-18-B 
Initiation of the confirmatory study AHV-18-B was delayed by a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic, but 
final results have been presented upon request by CHMP. The study had a very similar design as the 
AHV-18-A study, but with a slightly larger sample size (n=16 vs. n=12) and there was no untreated 
control wound in the AHV-18-B study. Based on the results, it could not be demonstrated that the 
control gel was non-inferior to petrolatum according to clinical score (primary endpoint). The study 
showed that the control gel was non-inferior to petrolatum according to planimetry score (secondary 
endpoint/ mean score from 2 independent assessors).  
Thus, it was concluded that based on the primary evaluation based on clinical assessment, the 
observed difference between the two treatments was 1.7 days, which is very similar to the magnitude 
of effect observed for the similar endpoint (time to first complete closure of the EB target wound by 
clinical assessment; median 92 days for Oleogel-S10 and 94 days for control gel, the first key 
secondary endpoint) in the pivotal EB study, i.e. 2 days. Hence, these results could not fully alleviate 
the concern that the difference observed for the primary endpoint in study BEB-13 may partly be due 
to an impaired wound healing caused by the control gel.  
Supportive external data  
As additional support, the applicant referred to a study with a different product, however, in a similar 
setting (randomised, vehicle-controlled study of a topical treatment in different EB subtypes). The aim 
was to provide support for the ‘natural history’ of wound healing in EB patients. In the study provided, 
the proportion of subjects who achieved the first target wound closure within 45 days on the vehicle 
was 24.05% and for the total population it was 27.15%. In BEB-13, 28.9% of subjects on control gel 
achieved complete wound healing within D45. Nevertheless, between-study comparisons should be 
made with caution and no detailed display on differences or similarities in e.g., DEB/JEB distribution, 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 119/162 
 
 
 
 
 
age and co-morbidities was included. Nevertheless, the data may provide some support that the BEB-
13 control gel behaved as expected and not obviously worse, although this study did not constitute a 
strong part of the justification for the control gel.  
Literature review 
The applicant also provided a literature review aimed to support that ingredients in the control gel are 
not associated with negative effects on wound healing. A number of authorised topical products contain 
beeswax and carnauba wax, thus, these are not unknown excipients. The applicant was also asked to 
provide any supporting literature data on the effects of topical products containing the same 
components as the control gel on wound healing, in general and in EB patients. This has been 
performed and a number of products and publications were referred to.  
The applicant concluded that none of the yellow wax- or carnauba wax-containing or products 
identified have been shown to have adverse effects on wound healing, however, this conclusion was 
complicated by several aspects. Firstly, a lack of reported negative effects on wound healing does not 
mean that there is none. Secondly, many products containing the waxes are products not indicated for 
use on open wounds, either because this is not the primary use or due to risk of adverse effects, e.g., 
systemic absorption of the active substance. Thirdly, when the waxes are used as excipients in topical 
products containing e.g., a topical corticosteroid, the effect of the steroid can mask potential negative 
effects, e.g., local irritant effects. Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that the applicant has fulfilled 
the requirement to compile literature data on the control gel components. Firm conclusions on lack of 
negative effects were difficult to draw from this data, although the presence of beeswax and carnauba 
wax in several topical medicinal products suggest that these components have no obvious harmful 
effects.  
A justification was also requested for the extrapolation of the results observed in the skin of healthy 
volunteers to the skin in patient with EB, taking aspects like wound area and treatment duration into 
account. The pivotal HV study could not demonstrate non-inferiority for control gel vs. petrolatum. 
Hence, a conclusive ‘lack of negative effect’ was difficult to extrapolate to EB patients. It is however 
acknowledged that healthy volunteers and not EB patients as a model for wound healing is preferred 
for the control gel assessment.  
In conclusion, based on the final AHV-18-B study results, the concern related to the BEB-13 control gel 
cannot be completely dismissed. However, collectively the information from the literature review, the 
AHV-18-A results (clinical score and planimetry), the AHV-18-B planimetry results and the comparison 
with the external study suggest that the control gel did not have a detrimental effect on wound 
healing. The confirmatory study AHV-18-B could not conclude on non-inferiority for the control gel vs. 
petrolatum for its primary endpoint. However, the applicant has made efforts to discuss and explain 
this issue and further data and/or justifications were not requested by the CHMP. 
Episalvan MA data 
The three studies supporting the approval of the partial-thickness wound indication for Episalvan 
showed statistically significant results in favour of Oleogel-S10. The relevance of the observed efficacy 
data for adults in acquired STSG donor site wounds or burn wounds to patients with inherited EB is 
unclear but likely to be limited, given the genetic basis for EB. During the assessment of Episalvan, the 
CHMP noted the small effect size in the Phase 3 studies in acquired wounds. However, in acquired 
wounds a reduction in time to wound closure or healing was considered clinically relevant by CHMP due 
to the potential for reduction of complications (infection, scarring, lengthy hospital stays) or avoidance 
of surgery. While the MAH has submitted the previous studies which were pivotal for the authorisation 
of Episalvan in the treatment of superficial burns, these cannot be accepted as pivotal to EB. EB is an 
entirely different condition, characterised by underlying chronic inherited blistering disease of skin and 
mucous membranes. Therefore, the effects seen in adults with acquired STSG donor site wounds or 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 120/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
burn wounds cannot be inferred for paediatric and adolescent patients with EB. Post-marketing efficacy 
(and safety) data are extremely limited for Episalvan. 
Additional expert consultations 
The position of the BSWP was sought on whether or not the application of the Cui, Hung, Wang (CHW) 
approach was appropriate as the primary test in the single pivotal phase 3 study BEB-13 (EASE) in the 
context of the Filsuvez MAA and on whether the type I error was appropriately controlled. The answer 
from the BSWP is presented below. 
Answer from BSWP to the Question by CHMP 
BSWP assessed the acceptability of the CHW-method as primary test in the BEB-13 study with one 
interim analysis including sample size re-estimation and whether BSWP considers that the type I error 
is adequately controlled in the context of the Filsuvez MAA.  
For continuous endpoints, the CHW-method is constructed to strictly control the type I error for an 
interim analysis with sample size re-assessment as in study BEB-13. For a binary endpoint as in the 
BEB-13 study, type I error control is based on asymptotic convergence which is sufficiently satisfied in 
the study BEB-13 with a sample size of 223 subjects. Overall, the CHW-method is considered adequate 
as primary test for the BEB-13 study and considered to methodologically control the type I error. In 
the following the risk of introducing bias, and hence endangering type I error control, due to the 
procedural step of sample size re-estimation and potential risk of unblinding is discussed.  
As the study is double-blind there is no direct suspicion that the outcome of the sample size re-
estimation may have influenced the decision-making process. To assess the risk of bias introduced 
through unblinding following the interim analysis, results including only subjects enrolled before and 
after sample size re-estimation were requested from the applicant. These results show an estimated 
treatment effect of OR=1.96, CI=(1.03, 3.74), in the first 192 subjects recruited as compared to an 
estimated treatment effect of OR=1.5, CI=(0.29, 7.85), in the 31 subjects recruited after sample size 
re-estimation. Of note, the observed closure rate in subjects recruited after sample size re-estimation 
is slightly higher in both treatment groups. The estimated treatment effect does not increase after 
sample size re-estimation and the results do not immediately raise the suspicion that interim results 
may have influenced the recruitment or outcome assessment of subjects after sample size re-
estimation. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that bias was introduced because of the sample 
size re-estimation.    
Based on the above considerations, it is concluded that assessment of the Filsuvez MAA application can 
be based on the submitted data which show an estimated treatment effect that is smaller than was 
assumed for the initial sample size estimation when planning the trial. The clinical relevance of the 
estimated treatment effect should be considered with the remainder of the evidence in the in-depth 
benefit-risk assessment.  
Summary of BSWP opinion 
BSWP is of the opinion that the CHW-method is appropriate as the primary test in the BEB-13 study 
and adequately controls the type I error in the context of the Filsuvez MAA.  
Need for additional expert consultation 
Considering the issues raised on robustness of the results of the primary endpoint with poor support 
from secondary endpoints, as well as the rarity of the disease without any approved therapies, 
consultation of external EB experts was considered necessary to assist CHMP to conclude on the 
benefit/risk. Upon request from the CHMP, an ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 15 March 
2022.

1.  Given the results of study BEB-13, does the AHEG consider that an effect of Filsuvez has 
been established in the studied population? 
The experts and the patients’ representatives acknowledged that EB is a very rare and complex disease 
with very high burden for patients affecting their daily lives. There are currently no approved treatment 
and thus the unmet medical need is very high. The standard of care is symptomatic aiming at preventing 
complication and improving the patients’ quality of life. Filsuvez is not a disease modifying agent. It is a 
symptomatic treatment. 
Given the results of study BEB-13, the majority of the experts considered that an effect has been 
established in the studied population for Filsuvez. The majority of the experts also agreed that the 
primary endpoint (i.e., % with first complete closure of EB target wound within 45 days) was met and 
is considered as clinically relevant and statistically significant. Further, although the other (secondary) 
endpoints were not statistically significant, their findings were considered to be clinically relevant by all 
patients’ representatives and by the majority of the experts too, especially the effects regarding 
reduction in pain and in frequency of dressing changes. However, one expert was not convinced by the 
Filsuvez’s effect based on all the data provided by the Applicant. This expert considered that although 
short term observations of benefit on clinical symptoms could be considered as good results; they do 
not demonstrate the long-term effect of the drug in re-epithelialisation as indeed there were no 
differences demonstrated on the long term as at Day 90 the following key secondary endpoint ‘% with 
first complete closure of EB target wound within Day 90’ and other secondary endpoints did not reach 
statistical significance. Further, the variability between the time points for some of the endpoints was 
also considered to be an issue for this expert.  
Overall, the majority of the experts and all the patients’ representatives considered that an effect with 
Filsuvez has been shown even if considered to be modest. It was mentioned that a high level of effect 
could not be expected to be observed with a topical formulation used in a very rare condition and for 
which the mechanism of action is not well determined. Therefore, one could not expect more 
convincing results. The majority of the experts agreed that the results showed an acceleration of 
wound healing, improvements on itching and pain, which are considered very important factors for EB 
patients.   
2.  If it can be concluded that an effect of Filsuvez in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) has been 
demonstrated, is this effect considered to be of clinical relevance for EB patients? 
The patients’ representatives and the majority of the experts considered that any effect/improvement 
would be of clinical relevance for EB patients and would be considered important especially due to the 
rarity of the disease and the very high unmet medical need for those patients. The reduction of time 
for dressing, the reduction of frequency of the dressing as well as the reduction of pain were 
particularly discussed and the majority of the experts agreed that results presented, although limited, 
showed to be beneficial and of clinical relevance for the EB patients. The expert, who did not consider 
that an effect was shown, was of the view that there was no clinical relevance for EB patients.   
3.  As the mechanism of action has not been proven, the view of the experts is sought on 
whether there is a biological rationale to expect a difference in response to treatment 
with Filsuvez in different EB subtypes, e.g.  dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB and 
DDEB) and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB)? 
It was highlighted that the precise mechanism of action of the drug in wound healing is not clearly 
known. It was also stated that the product has anti-inflammatory effects and that those were shown in 
different studies not only in EB.   
There was a consensus amongst the experts that based on biological differences in the EB sub-types of 
the disease, the wounds would be expected to behave differently. Indeed, the experts considered that 
JEB wounds would be more difficult to heal than the DEB wounds due to the involvement of different 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 122/162 
 
 
 
 
proteins (e.g., laminin 332, its absence causes tissue separation along the lamina lucida of the dermal-
epidermal basement membrane of the skin)/genes in JEB compared to DEB.  Further, given the small 
number of patients that is considered to be too low for the JEB sub-type, that no better clinical efficacy 
data were provided for the JEB subtype and taking into consideration the above-mentioned biological 
consideration; the experts considered that it will be inappropriate to extrapolate the efficacy results 
observed in DEB to the JEB subtype without further supporting data. Some experts also considered 
that a difference is not only expected from a biological viewpoint but also from the putative mechanism 
of action of Filsuvez such as the anti-inflammatory effect of the drug.  
Overall, the experts considered that one cannot infer that a drug that works in DEB would work in JEB 
as well. 
The patients’ representatives considered that any drug that overall works in EB would be considered as 
important for the EB patients.  
Third party intervention during the evaluation of Filsuvez  
The CHMP received, during the assessment of this application, a correspondence from the EB patient 
community (hereinafter referred to as “third party”) expressing the third party’ views about the 
perspective and experience of people affected by EB, and the unmet medical need of EB patients. The 
CHMP considered this intervention in the context of its assessment and concluded that the 
observations put forward by the EB patient community were already known by CHMP, and as such had 
no impact on the CHMP assessment or its conclusions. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The conduct of a randomised controlled study in the rare and severe condition EB was acknowledged 
and appreciated. The study was fairly large considering the orphan condition, with 223 patients 
randomised. The overall design of the study was endorsed. The issues related to the control gel (which 
is not the pure vehicle of Oleogel-S10, i.e., sunflower oil) have to the extent possible been alleviated 
by results from the healthy volunteer studies AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B and by literature data.  
As a single pivotal study has been conducted, the corresponding EMA guideline would be applicable, 
although the rarity of the EB condition needs to be taken into consideration. The efficacy of Oleogel-
S10 in the pivotal study BEB-13 was modest, with 41.3% of subjects achieving complete target wound 
closure within 45 days vs. 28.9% for the vehicle but considered clinically relevant by the CHMP. Even if 
the statistical robustness of the analysis of the primary endpoint has been questioned during the 
procedure, the CHMP is of the view, in line with the recommendation of the AHEG, that an effect of 
Filsuvez has been established considering that some of the sensitivity analyses supported the primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint. 
The support from secondary endpoints was considered to be limited by the CHMP, but demonstration 
of statistical significance for secondary endpoints is not a strict regulatory requirement. 
The majority of the experts and all patient representatives at the AHEG meeting considered that an 
effect with Filsuvez has been shown, even if considered to be modest. The enormous unmet medical 
need described by the EB community was acknowledged and the position at the AHEG meeting was 
that any effect/improvement would be of clinical relevance for EB patients. This was supported by the 
CHMP.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the totality of evidence is supportive of a beneficial treatment 
effect of Filsuvez. The difference, albeit modest, was considered clinically meaningful in the following

surface area. 
aSubjects with the EBS subtype were originally enrolled in the study but removed from eligibility criteria in Protocol Version 
4.0 (2 EBS subjects enrolled). 
The phase 3 study BEB-13 was considered pivotal for the safety assessment of Oleogel-S10 in EB 
patients. In the BEB-13 study, 223 patients were enrolled for the 90-day double-blind phase (DBP) 
with EB subtypes JEB and DEB and a median age of 12 years (range 6 months to 81 years). The 24-
month open-label follow-up phase of the BEB-13 study was still ongoing. 
The applicant has presented the data from the phase 2 study (BEB-10) in subjects with EB separately, 
without a pooled safety analysis for the EB indication or across indications. This approach was 
considered acceptable given differences in study design and duration. 
Oleogel-S10 was approved under the trade name Episalvan on 14 January 2016 in the EU for the 
treatment of partial-thickness wounds in adults for up to four weeks. In the three pivotal studies for 
the Episalvan MAA, two studies investigated split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (BSG-12 and 
BSH-12), and one study investigated patients with Grade 2a burn wounds (BBW-11). It has been 
concluded that Episalvan gel has a mild safety profile with adverse events limited to local application 
reactions. Listed undesirable effects associated with the use of Oleogel-S10 included wound 
complication, wound infections, and application/administration site reactions as these named identified 
events are listed as adverse reactions in the SmPC section 4.8 of Episalvan. However, Episalvan gel is 
not intended for long-term treatment in EB patients and the safety data from the authorised Episalvan 
was thus considered supportive only, taking into account uncertainties concerning long-term 
treatment, larger wound size area and a different target population in EB. The additional studies 
presented i.e., BEB-10, BSH-10 and BAK-08, were also considered supportive of the safety of this 
topical product. The CHMP agreed that pooling of the safety results from all studies was not required.  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In Table 21, an overview of exposure data from completed or ongoing clinicals studies of Oleogel-S10 
is presented. Overall, EB is a rare, designated orphan disease and the constraints in recruitment due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 128/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the rare condition is acknowledged. However, the sample size of long-term exposure and the 
characteristics of patients exposed is essential for an initial MAA also for an orphan disease such as EB. 
The application was submitted before the end of OLP of pivotal study BEB-13 and contained only 
interim data relating to the OLP.  
From the small short-term BEB-10 study, additional data from 10 patients were made available. Out of 
the 10 patients enrolled and completed the study, 9 subjects had been diagnosed with RDEB and 
1 subject with DDEB. The mean age of these 10 patients was 21.6 years (range, 6-48 years). More 
subjects were male (70.0%) than female (30.0%). Race was not collected in this study. The majority 
of subjects (60.0%) had a Fitzpatrick skin type of I. The median wound size when 1 wound was treated 
was 31.0 cm2; when 2 wounds were treated, the median wound sizes were 11.3 and 15.8 cm2. The 
patients were exposed to a 1 cm string of Oleogel-S10 gel (or 115 mg) per cm2 of wound eligible for 
study treatment for 13 to 29 days. The median calculated cumulative extent of exposure was 4966 mg 
(min. 1320 mg; max. 23437 mg), while the median daily extent of exposure was 305 mg (min. 88 mg; 
max. 1594 mg). 
In the three pivotal studies for the Episalvan MA, two studies investigated split-thickness skin graft 
donor site wounds (BSG-12 and BSH-12), which included a total of 219 patients (ITT: N=217), and 
one further study in 61 patients with Grade 2a burn wounds (ITT: N=57) (BBW-11). However, in the 
safety data from the non-EB pooled studies no patient 18 years of age was included, and no long-
term exposure data was available. The 219 patients with split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds 
had a mean age of 53 years; their donor site mean wound size was 81.5 cm2. In the burn wound study 
with 61 patients, the mean study wound area was 216 cm2; the total burn injury of these patients was 
larger and affected 5.8% of the total body surface area. The treatment duration differed for the 
different wound types with a mean ± SD treatment period of 18.5 ± 6.8 days for STSG and 10.4 ± 4.9 
days for study BBW-11. The median size of the treatment area was smaller for studies BSG-12 and 
BSH-12 (34 cm2) in comparison with the burn wound study BBW-11 (85 cm2). Most patients in the 
non-EB pooled studies were white (91%) and had a Fitzpatrick skin type of Grade II or III (77%).

aNo mean was calculated. Majority of subjects in both treatment groups reported dressing changes and study medication 
application occurred daily or every 2 days. 
bSix subjects, all in the control gel group, discontinued the DBP prematurely due to worsening of the EB target wound 
status or due to EB target wound infection and continued into the OLP prematurely (at the investigator’s discretion). 
Therefore, 100 subjects who received Oleogel-S10 in the DBP continued to the OLP; 105 subjects who received control gel 
in the DBP (99 plus 6 subjects who discontinued the DBP prematurely) continued to the OLP. 
cSubjects served as their own controls; subjects are not counted twice. 
dEach wound dressing change was performed according to the protocol for all subjects. Mean was not calculated. 
eNo mean was calculated.  
In the pivotal BEB-13 DBP, 195 (87.4%) of the 223 subjects had the EB subtype of DEB; of these, 
175 (78.5%) subjects had RDEB and 20 (9.0%) subjects had DDEB. Twenty-six (11.7%) subjects had 
JEB, and 2 (0.9%) subjects had EBS. The majority of included patients were male (60.1%), white 
(83.4%), had Fitzpatrick skin type of Grade Type II or III (83%). The mean age was 16.7 and the 
majority of patients <18 years of age (70%). An overview of the demographics in the BEB-13 study is

As all subgroups were small in the BEB-13 study dataset, it was agreed that the interpretation of 
subgroup data was limited, in particular in the subgroups race and geographic regions. While EB occurs 
in all races and ethnic groups, Black and Asian patients were underrepresented in the safety analysis. 
This is reflected in the SmPC section 5.1.  
In the BEB-13 study, not only a target wound, but all of a patient’s partial thickness EB wounds were 
treated with Oleogel-S10 or control gel. Oleogel-S10 was to be administered topically at approximately 
1 mm (0.04 inch) thickness. Wound areas were then to be covered with a standard of care non-
adhesive wound dressing. The mean (SD) duration of treatment in the DBP was 89.0 (18.43) days in 
the Oleogel-S10 group and 86.8 (23.64) days in the control gel group. Overall treatment compliance, 
specifically in relation to the target wound, was approximately 99% in both groups. In the DBP the 
patients used from 18 g to 7830 g of Oleogel-S10 or control gel.  
The betulin concentration in capillary and/or venous blood samples in the DBP of BEB-13, has been 
evaluated in sections related to pharmacokinetics. It has been agreed that the Filsuvez was a locally 
applied, locally acting product with limited systemic absorption. 
From the ongoing long-term exposure OLP of the BEB-13 study, the applicant has provided interim 
safety data with data lock point of 21 December 2020 and in the 90-Day Safety Update Report with 
data lock point 21 April 2021. On 21 April 2021, out of 205 patients who entered the ongoing BEB-13 
OLP, 144 (70%) had completed the month 12 visit, and 68 patients (33.2%) completed the month 24 
visit. In addition, subjects in the so called “former Oleogel-S10 group” have received an additional 3

months of exposure to Oleogel-S10 during the previous DBP. Thus, the 82 patients in the “former 
Oleogel-S10-group” that completed the month 9 visit, have been exposed to Oleogel-S10 for 12 
months in total, i.e., 156 patients have been exposed to Oleogel-S10 for 12 months. 
The total quantity of Oleogel-S10 used in the OLP of the BEB-13 study up to 21 April 2021 is displayed 
in Table 23. As the quantity of product used (and hence the tertile calculation) was only available for 
subjects who have completed Visit 7 at Day 90 (for the end of the DBP) and Visit 10 at Month 24 (for 
the end of the OLP), respectively, the subgroups were very small and it was agreed that the 
interpretation of these data might be limited. Also, the amount of study medication used was only 
applied to subjects recruited after Protocol Version 4.0. The highest extent of exposure to Oleogel-S10 
in a subject was 33.7 kg over a 24-month period, who did not experience any AE.

A summary of exposure data by age group from the BEB-13 DBP and interim data from the OLP was 
included in SmPC section 5.1.  
In the pivotal BEB-13 study, the majority of the included patients were <18 years of age (Table 22). A 
total of 17 subjects under 4 years old entered the BEB-13 study of which 14 had RDEB with the 
majority having generalised severe RDEB. In the Oleogel-S10 arm (n=7), all subjects completed the 
DBP and then entered the OLP. In the control gel arm (n=10), 7 subjects completed the DBP and 
entered the OLP; 3 subjects discontinued DBP prior to completion, with 2 of these subjects entering 
OLP (Figure 13). Hence, 16 subjects entered the OLP.

Figure 13. Age distribution: ≥21 days and < 4 years. 
In the age group 0 to <4 years, as of the OLP Month 12 Efficacy DBL on 15 July 2021, 3 subjects had 
withdrawn: 1 former control gel subject withdrew consent after 360 days treatment with Oleogel-S10 
in the OLP; 1 former control gel subject withdrew due to an AE after 90 days of treatment with 
Oleogel-S10 in the OLP; 1 Oleogel-S10 subject withdrew due to worsening of medical condition after 
381 days treatment in the DBP and OLP (90 days and 291 days respectively). One subject had 
completed the OLP and 12 subjects were ongoing.  
There were no safety data for children under the age of 6 months. The applicant argued that 
considering that Oleogel-S10 was a topical treatment and minimally systemically absorbed, the use in 
children under 6 months was not expected to have any different safety profile to those already seen in 
the rest of the population. This was not agreed. Since the immune system of newborns and infants is 
not fully developed, they are more susceptible to infections. Therefore, due to lack of data, it is not 
known if children under the age of 6 months have a higher risk of for example wound infections when 
treated with Oleogel-S10. Therefore, at present, the available safety database for Oleogel-S10 in the 
long-term treatment of JEB and DEB patients under the age of 6 months was considered insufficient. 
This is also discussed in section 2.6.9.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Since the control gel used in clinical studies contained the vehicle of Filsuvez, i.e., sunflower oil, AEs 
related to the control gel were also considered of importance. 
Cumulatively (up to 21 April 2021), nonserious, serious, and severe AEs were reported for a number of 
subjects. The overall summary of adverse events in the BEB-13 study is presented in Table 25.

Note: Calculation of percentages is based on N.  
In the BEB-13 DBP, the most frequently reported AEs in the Oleogel-S10 group (N=109) and the 
control gel group (N=114), respectively, were wound complication (61.5% and 53.5%), pyrexia (8.3% 
and 13.2%), wound infection (7.3% and 8.8%), pruritus (7.3% and 5.3%), anaemia (7.3% and 
3.5%), and cough (2.8% and 7.0%) (Table 26). 
Of the 205 subjects who have participated in the OLP (all of whom receive Oleogel-S10), a total of 145 
(70.7%) subjects have reported at least 1 AE as of the Safety Update cut-off date of 21 April 2021. Up 
to 21 April 2021, the most frequently reported AEs (≥5% of all subjects) were wound complication 
(39.5%), anaemia (14.1%), wound infection staphylococcal (9.8%), wound infection (9.3%), 
oesophageal stenosis (8.8%), pyrexia (8.3%), wound infection bacterial (5.9%), and pruritus (5.9%). 
Two PTs, malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency, were newly included within the incidence threshold of 
≥2% of all subjects (3.4% and 2.0%, respectively) Table 26).

By age group category, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 AE was 62.5% (10/16 subjects) 
in the age group 0 to <4 years, 74.1% (60/81 subjects) in the age group 4 to <12 years, 66.0% 
(33/50 subjects) in the age group 12 to <18 years, and 72.4% (42/58 subjects) in the age group ≥18 
years. In these same 4 age group categories, the most frequently reported AE overall was wound 
complication (31.3%, 43.2%, 34.0%, and 41.4%, respectively).  
The overall incidence of AEs by gender was 65.1% (82/126 subjects) for males and 79.7% (63/79 
subjects) for females. In males, the most frequently reported AE was wound complication (36.5%); no 
other AE was reported at a frequency of ≥10% in males. In females, the most frequently reported AEs 
were wound complication (44.3%), anaemia (21.5%), wound infection (13.9%), wound infection 
staphylococcal (13.9%), and pruritus (10.1%). The AE incidence in the Infections and Infestations SOC 
was lower in males (27.8%) than in females (41.8%); however, this difference was not reflected in 
any particular PT.

Unless otherwise indicated, “wound complication” referred to AEs with MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) or 
Lowest Level Term (LLT) of “wound complication” and included e.g. wound re-opening, increase in 
wound size, wound worsening, increase in wound burden, worsening of EB wound pain, and wound 
odour, but excluded AEs such as wound haemorrhage, wound secretion, wound pain, wound infection, 
pruritus, and administration site pain, as these were coded to separate PT/LLT. There were no baseline 
data available and according to the applicant, no historical data on the incidence of wound complication 
from standard of care.  
The BEB-13 protocol specified that worsening of wound status, increase in wound size, re-opening of 
wounds, and wound infections should be reported as AEs, following an FDA advice. When the 
investigators clinically assessed the wound for closure as part of the efficacy endpoint evaluation, they 
were required to complete a specific case report form (CRF) page with detailed wound closure 
assessments, and if the investigator marked that the wound had worsened, they were prompted to 
report an AE. Most wound complication AEs were not assessed as treatment-related by the investigator 
since changes in wound size from visit to visit, as well as reopening of previously closed wounds, are 
expected in EB due to the subjects’ genetic skin fragility. In this comprehensive evaluation, only 
wounds that had closed could have met the category of “wound reopening” and only wounds that had 
decreased in size could have met the category of “increase in wound size compared to the previous 
visit.” Thus, according to the applicant, there was an overlap with facets of the efficacy endpoint 
assessment of the target and non-target wounds.  
In the BEB-13 study, the applicant conducted an important analysis of wound complications which 
highlighted a higher incidence of wound reopening (which could only occur if a wound had closed 
during the DBP) and increased in wound size compared to the previous visit in the Oleogel-S10 group 
as compared to the control gel group (28.4% vs. 17.5% and 11.0% vs 6.1%, respectively) during the 
DBP of BEB-13. It was also noted that during the DBP the composite events of increase in wound 
burden, worsening of EB wound pain, and wound odour were also worse for the Oleogel-S10 group 
(3.7% v 2.6%). During the OLP, the overall incidence of wound complication-related AEs in the OLP 
was 38.0%. This frequency was lower than in the DBP (65% of Oleogel-S10 group and 53.5% in the 
control gel) though it was noted that in the OLP (still ongoing) there was only 1 study visit (Month 3) 
at which target, and additional wounds were required to be clinically assessed for wound closure. The 
AEs related to wound complication in the ongoing BEB-13 OLP study at cut-off date 11 June 2020 and 
21 April 2021 are presented in Table 27

In terms of wound reopening, the applicant confirmed that reopening occurred for 28.4% of Oleogel-
S10 treated patients vs. 17.5% of control patients though the overall incidence of wound complication-
related AEs was not substantially different between the treatment groups (61.5% in the Oleogel-S10 
group and 53.5% in the control gel group). The applicant argued that as only wounds that had closed 
during the DBP could reopen; the increased frequency of reopening was viewed as a marker of 
efficacy. Throughout the DBP there was little difference between the proportions of target wounds 
assessed as closed for those patients treated with Oleogel-S10 vs control gel. A total of 45 patients out 
of 109 treated with Oleogel-S10 achieved first complete closure within 45±7 days. One wound reached 
first closure at day 7 and reopened by day 30, though it was assessed as closed again by day 60. 
Fifteen first complete wound closures occurred by day 14, with 7 of these assessed as reopened by day 
30 (47%). Eighteen wounds reached first complete closure by day 30 with 6 of these reopening by day 
45 (33%). Eleven wounds reached first complete closure by day 45 with 5 of these reopening by day 
45 (45%). The applicant has previously argued that analysis of sustained closure was less relevant for 
EB due to nature of the fragile, structurally defective skin of EB patients which remained susceptible to 
re-opening after the achievement of closure. While this point is acknowledged it appeared that 
approximately 40% of first complete closures had reopened within 15 days and the clinical relevance of 
this duration of closure was uncertain.  
Wound infections were reported also at baseline in the EB patients i.e., wound infection (5.8%), skin 
infection (4.5%), staphylococcal skin infection (1.8%) sepsis (1.3%), pseudomonal skin infection 
(0.9%), skin bacterial infection (0.4%), staphylococcal bacteraemia (0.4%), staphylococcal infection 
(0.4%), and pseudomonal infection (0.4%). Nevertheless, in case of wound infection the treatment 
with Filsuvez should be discontinued as recommended in SmPC section 4.4.  
In SmPC section 4.4 the applicant has proposed a warning that the product should be removed by eye 
irrigation in case of exposure to eyes. This warning is considered relevant. 
Considering that Filsuvez is a locally applied, locally acting product with limited systemic absorption 
and taking into account the reported AEs up to now, the statement that Filsuvez has no or negligible 
influence on the ability to drive and use machines in SmPC section 4.7 was agreed.  
Overdosing with Filsuvez is unlikely. No case of overdose has been reported when a maximum amount 
of 69 g was used on a daily basis for more than 90 days. No data have been generated to establish the 
effect of accidental ingestion. This is included in SmPC section 4.9. 
In SmPC section 4.8, the most frequently observed adverse reactions in EB patients, were wound 
complication (in 11.6% of patients), application site reaction (5.8%), wound infections (4.0%), 
pruritus (3.1%) and hypersensitivity reactions (1.3%). In patients with grade 2a burn wounds or split 
thickness skin grafts, the most frequently observed adverse reactions were wound complication (in 
2.9% of patients), pain of skin (2.5%) and pruritus (1.3%).

Based on the data submitted for the MA of Episalvan, the applicant has included the following ADRs as 
uncommon: dermatitis, rash pruritic, purpura and pain; this is agreed. 
Wound complication was split in to two different SOCs, i.e., data from non-EB patients in the SOC 
‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’ but data from EB-patients was considered more 
appropriate under the SOC ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the DBP of BEB-13. In the OLP of BEB-13 up to the cut-off date 21 April 2021, 
6 patients have died. All deaths were assessed as anticipated with regard to disease course, none of 
these deaths were considered related to Oleogel-S10:

Since the intended action of Filsuvez gel is to promote wound healing, there is a potential proliferative 
and/or carcinogenic effect of the product, even if there was no evidence of such effects from the 
currently available data. The applicant planned to further characterise the important potential risk 
(clinical) and has included pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP which will include both a specific 
skin malignancies questionnaire and a register-based study (see section on the RMP). It was agreed, 
considering the chronic nature of the underlying disease and the recommended long-term treatment 
with Filsuvez, that monitoring of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and other skin malignancy events was 
clinically important. The direct effect of Oleogel-S10 on cell differentiation and/or proliferation, i.e., an 
underlying potential, local carcinogenic action was also discussed from a non-clinical perspective. 
Furthermore, in terms of non-clinical characterisation of carcinogenicity, it was noted that so far no 
carcinogenicity studies have been performed (see Non-clinical sections). 
A warning that in the case of diagnosis of SCC or other skin malignancies, treatment to the affected 
area should be discontinued has been included in SmPC section 4.4. 
Up to 21 April 2021, 44 of the 205 subjects (21.5%) have reported a total of 85 SAEs in the OLP 
(Table 29 and  
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 140/162 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 30). During the reporting period, 11 new SAEs were reported, of which 2 occurred in 2 additional 
subjects; the remaining 9 SAEs occurred in subjects for whom SAEs had been previously reported. The 
most common SAEs during the reporting period were oesophageal stenosis (4.4%) and anaemia 
(3.9%); these were the same 2 most common SAEs at the previous data lock point 11 Jun 2020. The 2 
new subjects with SAEs during the reporting period were in the 4 to <12 years category (1 subject; 
oesophageal stenosis) and in the 12 to <18 years category (1 subject; anaemia). The applicant stated 
that oesophageal stenosis and anaemia were anticipated with regard to the disease course. Although 
the number of SAEs were increasing with longer exposure to Oleogel-S10, it was agreed that anaemia, 
oesophageal stenosis were anticipated with regard to the disease course and the baseline 
characteristics of the 223 patients included at the start of the BEB-13 study, included anaemia in 
33.6% of the patients and oesophageal stenosis in 25.1% of the patients.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
In the EB studies (BEB-13, BEB-10), there were inherent difficulties in conducting standard clinical 
safety evaluations such as electrocardiograms (ECGs, which use adhesive standard electrodes) and 
blood pressure measurements (which typically use arm or wrist cuffs) because of the fragility of the 
subjects' skin. However, in the pivotal BEB-13 study in EB, blood samples for clinical laboratory tests, 
ECGs, and vital sign measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature only) were 
collected per the study's schedule of assessments when feasible. 
In the DBP of BEB-13, mean changes from baseline in haematology and biochemistry parameters from 
baseline to Day 90 were generally small and not clinically relevant. There were no clinically significant 
mean or median changes from baseline to Day 90 in the DBP vital sign parameters, and no differences 
were observed between treatment groups.  
In the other clinical studies of Oleogel-S10, laboratory testing and measurement of vital signs were not 
performed. 
Taking into account that Filsuvez gel is a locally applied, locally acting product with limited systemic 
absorption and considering the pain and fragility of the skin of RDEB and JEB patients, the clinical 
laboratory tests and measurements of vital signs performed in the pivotal BEB-13 study were 
considered sufficient. No safety issues have been identified from clinical laboratory tests and 
measurements of vital signs performed in the pivotal BEB-13 study.  
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
From the BEB-13 study, there were no major differences identified in the nature and incidence of AEs 
for patients below or above 18 years of age and considering that Filsuvez is a locally applied, locally 
acting product with limited systemic absorption, it is agreed that no dose adjustment is required in 
elderly for Filsuvez. For the authorised medicinal product Episalvan, it was concluded that there were 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 143/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no major differences in the nature and incidence of AEs for patients aged less than 65 years compared 
with older patients. 
Taking into account that Filsuvez gel is a local treatment, and the systemic exposure is limited it is 
agreed that no dose adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment. Furthermore, no effects on human fertility are anticipated since the systemic 
exposure is low. No studies of Oleogel-S10 in pregnant women have been conducted, and it is 
unknown whether birch bark extract/metabolites are excreted in human milk after the administration 
of Oleogel-S10.  
Animal studies with respect to reproductive toxicity have been assessed in the non-clinical sections. 
Since there are no data on pregnant women, it was considered appropriate to state in SmPC section 
4.6 that there are no data in pregnant women. The additional phrase ‘limited amount of data (less than 
300 pregnancy outcomes)’ was not included, although a standard phrase, since it was considered 
misleading, in particular since that the total safety database in EB patients was less than 300 patients.  
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity symptoms have been reported in both BEB-13 subjects and in subjects from the 
supportive clinical studies for the Episalvan indication of partial-thickness wounds.  
The same extract from birch bark and the same vehicle were included in Episalvan and hypersensitivity 
to the active substance or to the excipient contained in the product is a contraindication for the use of 
Episalvan. In addition, hypersensitivity and dermatitis are listed in SmPC section 4.8 for Episalvan. It is 
agreed that the same risk of hypersensitivity reactions is anticipated during the use of Filsuvez in EB 
patients. Therefore, the proposed contraindication and warning regarding hypersensitivity in the SmPC 
for Filsuvez is agreed. It is also agreed that hypersensitivity should be listed in SmPC section 4.8.  
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In the pivotal BEB-13 study, 201 (90.1%) subjects took at least one concomitant product during the 
DBP, including medicinal products and food supplements. Concomitant products were taken for 
conditions of the alimentary tract and metabolism (57.8%; mostly laxatives, vitamins and minerals), 
blood and blood forming organs (49.3%; mostly iron supplements), respiratory system (48.0%; 
mostly piperazine derivatives and antihistamines), nervous system (42.6%; mostly analgesics), and 
dermatologicals (39.9%).  
Filsuvez is a locally applied, locally acting product with limited systemic absorption. Hence, no systemic 
drug-drug interactions were expected, and it was accepted that no drug-drug interaction studies were 
included in the development program. In SmPC section 4.5 of Episalvan, the recommendation is that 
other topical products should not be concomitantly used together with Episalvan but rather sequentially 
or alternatively depending on the clinical need. Due to the lack of additional data or other justification 
for Filsuvez, the text in SmPC section 4.5 was harmonised with the SmPC of Episalvan. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five patients had AEs leading to study withdrawal during the DBP of BEB-13, three patients in the 
Oleogel-S10 group and two in the control gel group. The AEs leading to study withdrawal in the 
Oleogel-S10 group were wound haemorrhage in one patient, procedural pain in one patient and SCC of

the skin (diagnosed upon enrolment and not treated with Oleogel-S10) in one patient. Wound 
haemorrhage and SCC were considered SAEs. 
Cumulatively (up to 21 April 2021), a total of 60 patients have discontinued the OLP. A total of 14 
patients have been withdrawn from the OLP because of AEs. Since the time of the previous data cut-
off, an additional 4 subjects have discontinued the study (3 who withdrew of consent and 1 who 
withdrew for other reasons). No new discontinuations due to AEs have occurred to date (Table 31).

2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
The post marketing experience with Oleogel-10 is limited. To date, 11 patients (in Colombia and 
Argentina) have received Episalvan for partial-thickness wounds in EB under a Named Patient Program. 
An additional 5 patients (not eligible for enrolment in BEB-13 study) received Oleogel-S10 in France 
and Germany on a compassionate use basis. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Oleogel-S10 containing 10% of dry extract from birch bark and with sunflower oil as the only excipient, 
has already been approved under the trade name Episalvan for the treatment of partial-thickness 
wounds in adults for up to four weeks. The systemic absorption of betulin has been assessed in the 
pharmacokinetics sections. It has been agreed that, as also concluded in the MA for the Episalvan gel, 
that the Oleogel-S10 is a locally applied, locally acting gel with limited systemic absorption. 
Episalvan has been placed on the market but has not yet been launched commercially in the EU. 
Hence, the post marketing experience with Episalvan is limited. The three pivotal studies for the 
Episalvan MAA included a total of 280 patients. In split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds the 
mean wound size was 40.7 cm² (range 8-300 cm²) and in the Grade 2a burn wound the mean wound 
size was 108 cm² (range 23-395 cm²). In the pooled analysis of safety from these non-EB studies, 
most patients (91%) were white, and had a Fitzpatrick skin type of Grade II or III (77%). The mean 
age was around 50 years and approximately 25% of the patients were aged ≥ 65 years. It was 
concluded that Episalvan gel had a mild safety profile for the treatment of partial-thickness wounds in 
adults for up to four weeks with adverse events limited to local application reactions. Listed 
undesirable effects associated with the use of Oleogel-S10 include wound complication, wound

infections, and application/administration site reactions as these named identified events are listed as 
adverse reactions in the SmPC section 4.8 of Episalvan. However, no patient 18 years of age was 
included, and no long-term exposure data was available from the non-EB pooled studies. Overall, data 
from the authorised Episalvan were considered supportive only for Filsuvez, taking into account 
uncertainties concerning long-term treatment, larger wound size area and a different target population 
in EB.  
The phase 3 study BEB-13 was considered pivotal for the safety assessment of Oleogel-S10 in patients 
with EB. In the BEB-13 study, 223 patients were enrolled for the 90-day DBP with EB subtypes JEB 
(11.7%) and DEB (87.5%), with a median age of 12 years (range 6 months to 81 years). The majority 
of patients were <18 years of age (70%), white (83.4%), and had Fitzpatrick skin type of Grade Type 
II or III (83%). Comorbidities reported in included EB patients were e.g., anaemia, malnutrition, 
oesophageal stenosis, susceptibility to infections. 
In the DBP part of the BEB-13 study, 109 patients were exposed for 90-days only. The Filsuvez MAA 
was submitted before the end of the 24-month open-label follow up phase (OLP) of the pivotal study 
BEB-13 and contained only interim data relating to the OLP. The applicant has provided additional 
safety data with data lock point of 21 December 2020 and a 90-Day Safety Update Report with data 
lock point 21 April 2021. On 21 April 2021, out of 205 patients who entered the ongoing BEB-13 open 
label phase (OLP) 144 (70%) had completed the month 12 visit, and 68 patients (33.2%) had 
completed the 24 months visit. In addition, subjects in the so called “former Oleogel-S10 group” have 
received an additional 3 months of exposure to Oleogel-S10 during the previous DBP. Thus, the 82 
patients in the “former Oleogel-S10-group” that completed the month 9 visit, have been exposed to 
Oleogel-S10 for 12 months in total, i.e., 156 patients have been exposed to Oleogel-S10 for 12 
months. In comparison with the safety data submitted with the initial submission, it was agreed that 
there were no new safety issues detected from the 90-Day Safety Update Report with data lock point 
21 April 2021.  
As all subgroups were small in the BEB-13 study dataset, the interpretation of subgroup data was 
limited, in particular in the subgroups race and geographic regions. While EB occurs in all races and 
ethnic groups, Black and Asian patients were underrepresented in the safety analysis. This is reflected 
in the SmPC section 5.1.  
While there did not appear to be a difference in safety profile by age group category from the data 
presented, there was uncertainty around this assumption due to the small subgroups. The applicant 
argued that considering that Oleogel-S10 is a topical treatment and minimally systemically absorbed, 
the use in children under 6 months is not expected to have any different safety profile to those already 
seen in the rest of the population. This was not agreed by the CHMP. Since the immune system of 
newborns and infants is not fully developed, they are considered to be more susceptible to infections. 
Therefore, due to lack of data, it is not known if children under the age of 6 months may have a higher 
risk of for example wound infections when treated with Oleogel-S10. Therefore, at present, the 
available safety database for Oleogel-S10 in the long-term treatment of JEB and DEB patients under 
the age of 6 months was considered insufficient. Consequently, the applicant agreed to restrict the 
therapeutic indication to patients 6 months and older.  
In SmPC section 4.8, the most frequently observed adverse reactions in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) 
patients, were wound complication (in 11.6% of patients), application site reaction (5.8%), wound 
infections (4.0%), pruritus (3.1%) and hypersensitivity reactions (1.3%). In patients with grade 2a 
burn wounds or split thickness skin grafts, the most frequently observed adverse reactions were wound 
complication (in 2.9% of patients), pain of skin (2.5%) and pruritus (1.3%).

Hypersensitivity symptoms have been reported in both BEB-13 subjects and in subjects from the 
supportive clinical studies for the Episalvan indication of partial-thickness wounds. The same extract 
from birch bark and the same vehicle are included in Episalvan and hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or to the excipient contained in the product is a contraindication for the use of Episalvan. In 
addition, hypersensitivity and dermatitis are listed in SmPC section 4.8 for Episalvan. It is agreed that 
the same risk of hypersensitivity reactions is anticipated during the use of Filsuvez in EB patients. 
Therefore, the proposed contraindication and warning in the SmPC for Filsuvez is agreed. It is also 
agreed that hypersensitivity should be listed in SmPC section 4.8.  
Wound infections were reported also at baseline in the EB patients including wound infection (5.8%), 
skin infection (4.5%), staphylococcal skin infection (1.8%) sepsis (1.3%), pseudomonal skin infection 
(0.9%), skin bacterial infection (0.4%), staphylococcal bacteraemia (0.4%), staphylococcal infection 
(0.4%), and pseudomonal infection (0.4%). Nevertheless, in case of wound infection the treatment 
with Filsuvez should be discontinued as recommended in SmPC section 4.4.  
Five patients had AEs leading to study withdrawal during the DBP of BEB-13, three patients in the 
Oleogel-S10 group and two in the control gel group. The AEs leading to study withdrawal in the 
Oleogel-S10 group were wound haemorrhage in one patient, procedural pain in one patient and SCC of 
the skin in one patient. Wound haemorrhage and SCC were considered SAEs. Cumulatively (up to 21 
April 2021), a total of 60 patients have discontinued the OLP. A total of 14 patients have been 
withdrawn from the OLP because of AEs.  
Since the intended action of Filsuvez gel is to promote wound healing, the CHMP considered that there 
was a potential proliferative and/or carcinogenic effect of the product, even if there was no evidence of 
such effects from the currently available data. In order to address this safety concern, the applicant 
planned to further characterise this important potential risk (clinical) and has included additional 
pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP which will include both a specific skin malignancies 
questionnaire and a registry-based study (see RMP section 2.7). It is agreed, considering the chronic 
nature of the underlying disease and the recommended long-term treatment with Filsuvez, that 
monitoring of SCC and other skin malignancy events is clinically important. The direct effect of 
Oleogel-S10 on cell differentiation and/or proliferation, i.e., an underlying potential, local carcinogenic 
action was also discussed from a non-clinical perspective. Furthermore, in terms of non-clinical 
characterisation of carcinogenicity, carcinogenicity studies have been performed so far (see Non-
clinical sections). Further, a warning regarding the need to discontinue treatment with Filsuvez in the 
case of diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or other skin malignancies, has been agreed upon in 
SmPC section 4.4. 
Taking into account that Filsuvez gel is a local treatment and the systemic exposure is limited it is 
agreed that no dose adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for elderly patients or 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Furthermore, no effects on human fertility are anticipated 
since the systemic exposure is low. No studies of Oleogel-S10 in pregnant women have been 
conducted, and it is unknown whether birch bark extract/metabolites are excreted in human milk after 
the administration of Oleogel-S10. Animal studies with respect to reproductive toxicity have been 
assessed in the non-clinical sections. Since there are no data on pregnant women, it is considered 
appropriate to state in SmPC section 4.6 that there are no data in pregnant women. The additional 
standard phrase ‘limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes)’ was deleted as it was 
considered misleading, in particular since that the total safety database in EB patients is less than 300 
patients.

In the pivotal BEB-13 study, 201 (90.1%) subjects took at least one concomitant product during the 
DBP, including medicinal products and food supplements. Concomitant products were taken for 
conditions of the alimentary tract and metabolism (57.8%; mostly laxatives, vitamins and minerals), 
blood and blood forming organs (49.3%; mostly iron supplements), respiratory system (48.0%; 
mostly piperazine derivatives and antihistamines), nervous system (42.6%; mostly analgesics), and 
dermatologicals (39.9%). Filsuvez is a locally applied, locally acting product with limited systemic 
absorption. Hence, no systemic drug-drug interactions are expected and it is accepted that no drug-
drug interaction studies were included in the development program. In SmPC section 4.5 of Episalvan, 
the recommendation is that other topical products should not be concomitantly used together with 
Episalvan but rather sequentially or alternatively depending on the clinical need. Due to the lack of 
additional data or other justification for Filsuvez, the text in SmPC section 4.5 was harmonised with the 
SmPC of Episalvan. 
In SmPC section 4.4 the applicant has proposed a warning that the product should be removed by eye 
irrigation in the case of exposure to eyes. This warning is considered relevant. 
Considering that Filsuvez is a locally applied, locally acting product with limited systemic absorption 
and taking into account the reported AEs up to now, the statement that Filsuvez has no or negligible 
influence on the ability to drive and use machines in SmPC section 4.7 is agreed.  
Overdosing with Filsuvez is unlikely. No case of overdose has been reported when a maximum amount 
of 69 g was used on a daily basis for more than 90 days. No data have been generated to establish the 
effect of accidental ingestion. This is included in SmPC section 4.9. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data base of Oleogel-S10 in JEB and DEB patients must be regarded as limited, even if the 
study was fairly large considering the orphan status of EB. Moreover, very limited long-term data are 
currently available for this chronic treatment. Data from the authorised Episalvan are considered 
supportive only, taking into account uncertainties concerning long-term treatment, larger wound size 
area and a different target population in EB.  
The 24-month open-label follow up phase (OLP) with 205 EB patients is still ongoing and at present, 
the applicant has provided interim safety data with data lock point of 21 April 2021. The final CSR will 
be submitted once available (i.e., by Q1 2023). On 21 April 2021, out of 205 patients who entered the 
ongoing BEB-13 OLP 144 (70%) had completed the month 12 visit, and 68 patients (33.2%) had 
completed the 24 months visit. EB is a rare, designated orphan disease and the constraints in 
recruitment due to the rare condition is acknowledge. 
As all subgroups are small in the BEB-13 study dataset, it is agreed that the interpretation of subgroup 
data is limited, in particular in the subgroups race and geographic regions. While there does not appear 
to be a difference in safety profile by age group category from the data presented, there is uncertainty 
around this assumption. In the pivotal BEB-13 study, the majority of the included patients were <18 
years of age, of which 16 patients (8%) under 4 years of age entered the OLP. There are no safety 
data for children under the age of 6 months. The Applicant initially applied for an indication covering all 
ages. However, considering the very limited data in the youngest age group, an indication from birth 
onwards was not supported and a lower age limit of 6 months has been introduced. 
Since the intended action of Filsuvez gel is to promote wound healing, there is a potential proliferative 
and/or carcinogenic effect of the product, even if there is no evidence of such effects from the

currently available data. The applicant plans to further characterise the important potential risk 
(clinical) and has included additional pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP which will include both a 
specific skin malignancies questionnaire and a registry-based study (see RMP section 2.7). A warning 
that in the case of diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or other skin malignancies, treatment to the 
affected area should be discontinued has been agreed upon in SmPC section 4.4. The warning also 
highlights to prescribers that while there has been no increase of skin malignancies associated with 
Filsuvez to date, a theoretical increased risk of skin malignancies associated with use of Filsuvez 
cannot be ruled out. 
In SmPC section 4.8, the most frequently observed adverse reactions in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) 
patients, were wound complication (in 11.6% of patients), application site reaction (5.8%), wound 
infections (4.0%), pruritus (3.1%) and hypersensitivity reactions (1.3%). In conclusion, the overall 
safety profile of Oleogel-S10 in JEB and DEB patients over the age of 6 months is considered 
acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
EB is a rare (‘orphan’) heterogeneous group of genetic skin fragility disorders characterised by 
blistering and erosions of epithelial surfaces in response to minor trauma or friction. EB is divided into 
4 major subtypes, based on the level of skin cleavage: 
o  Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS, intra-epidermal skin separation). 
o 
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB, skin separation within the lamina lucida or central basement 
membrane zone). 
o  Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB, sublamina densa or dermal separation). Based on the 
mode of inheritance, this is subdivided into dominant (DDEB) and recessive (RDEB) forms. 
o  Kindler syndrome (variable level of separation in the skin within basal keratinocytes, at the level of 
the lamina lucida or below the lamina densa). 
One of the most significant problems in EB is the lifelong presence of skin blistering and partial-
thickness wounds that result in pruritus, pain, scarring, deformity, loss of function, and immobility as 
well as a high risk of complications, such as infection. In addition, there is an increased incidence of 
aggressive cutaneous SCC at a younger age than in the general population. In patients with 
generalised severe RDEB, SCC occurs in approximately 80% of patients by their mid-40s and can occur 
as early as adolescence. 
The applicant has sought a marketing authorisation for Filsuvez for the following indication:  
Treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa 
(EB) in patients 6 months and older.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No approved therapy exists for EB in the EU. There are no medical treatments that have demonstrated 
efficacy in the treatment or prevention of the recognised clinical manifestations of this rare genetic 
disorder, which include debilitating symptoms and substantial morbidity; those with moderate to 
severe disease may have life-threatening manifestations and in a proportion of patients, the disease 
reduces life expectancy. 
The current treatment of EB wounds is symptomatic, including early judicious treatment of wounds to 
prevent or minimise infection and wound protection with non-adhesive dressings to enable wound 
healing. Patients with EB take care to minimise new wounds; however, this is particularly difficult for 
young children as minor trauma or friction results in partial-thickness wounds. 
The efficacy of topical agents aimed at improving wound healing may have direct implications on 
outcomes and quality of life for patients with EB. With regular application of such a product, the total 
wound burden and associated symptoms and complications of unhealed wounds such as infections, 
itching, and pain could be expected to decrease.  
Hence, an unmet need to achieve faster and improved wound healing exists in EB, to decrease 
complication (e.g., infections) and to improve quality of life (e.g. by reduced pain and itch). Most 
Assessment report

experts agree that “any acceleration” and “each day gained” in time to wound healing would be 
important and clinically significant for EB patients with partial-thickness wounds. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy data to support an EB indication for Filsuvez come primarily from a single phase 3 
study, BEB-13, with some support also from a small phase 2 study in EB patients, BEB-10. Two phase 
2 healthy subject studies with the control gel (AHV-18-A and AHV-18-B) are also referred to. In 
addition, the studies included in the submission for Episalvan are included as supportive data. 
Study BEB-13 was a randomised, controlled, 90-day double-blind phase 3 study, with a 24-month 
open-label follow-up of Oleogel-S10 in subjects with inherited EB. The study included subjects with 
dystrophic or junctional EB. Patients should have a target wound of 10 to 50 cm2 in surface, aged ≥21 
days but less than 9 months. The study had broad age inclusion criteria; subjects from the age of 21 
days could be included.  
A total of 223 subjects were randomized 1:1 to Oleogel-S10 (N=109) or control gel (N=114), both on 
top of standard of care (non-adhesive wound dressing). The control gel was specifically developed for 
use in this study, since the pure ‘vehicle’ (sunflower oil) could not be used. Oleogel-S10 or the control 
gel were to be applied on the EB target wound and also to all areas on the subject’s body that were 
affected by EB partial-thickness wounds. No maximum body surface area to be covered was specified 
in the protocol.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the EB 
target wound within 45 days of treatment with Oleogel-S10 compared with control gel based on clinical 
assessment by the investigator (the wound was to be rated as “closed” at first appearance of complete 
re-epithelialisation without drainage). 
Several secondary endpoints were also evaluated, reflecting other aspects of wound healing, incidence 
and severity of wound infections, change from baseline in total body wound burden and change from 
baseline in itching and pain.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met as the proportion of subjects with first complete closure of the 
EB target wound within 45 days of initiating treatment was higher in the Oleogel-S10 group (41.3%) 
compared to the control gel group (28.9%). The relative risk was 1.44 (1.01, 2.05) with an odds ratio 
(95% CI) of 1.84 (1.02, 3.30). This resulted in a p-value of 0.041 (CHM method) or a p-value of 0.013 
(CHW method). 
For the presentation based on stratification factors, the DEB strata showed higher rates of wound 
closure for Oleogel-S10 vs. control gel across wound size. For the overall RDEB group (n=175), 44.0% 
in the Oleogel-S10 group and 26.2% in the control group met the primary endpoints (p=0.008).  
When the Complete analysis set (CAS) and per protocol set (PPS) were evaluated, results of the 
primary efficacy analysis were numerically similar to those of the FAS. The proportion of subjects with 
first complete closure of the EB target wound within 45 days of treatment was higher for both 
populations in the Oleogel-S10 group compared to the control gel group (CAS: 44.0% vs. 30.3%; PPS: 
42.4% vs. 33.3%, respectively). Results for the CAS were statistically significant in favour of Oleogel-
S10 based on the CMH test stratified by EB subtype and target wound size class (p=0.034).  
In a sensitivity analysis, result for the primary endpoint was assessed based on confirmed, sustained 
healing of the target wound, at 7 days after the first healing was observed. Fewer subjects were rated 
as ‘success’ for both groups, with 17.4% achieving confirmed closure in the Oleogel-S10 group vs. 
8.8% in the control group. This difference was borderline significant (p=0.048). 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 155/162 
 
 
 
 
For the first key secondary endpoint (time to first complete closure of the EB target wound as 
evidenced by clinical assessment within 90 days) the difference between the treatment groups was not 
statistically significant (p=0.302). The median time to closure within 90 days was similar between 
treatment groups (92 days Oleogel-S10 and 94 days control gel). Hence, the results for the additional 
key secondary endpoints are not confirmatory.  
Apart from EB subtype, other subgroups were also analysed. With respect to age, the largest part of 
the study population were aged below 18 years with the largest sub-group being those aged 4 to <12 
years, comprising 38% overall. In this age subgroup, the most pronounced difference between 
treatments in favour of Oleogel-S10 was observed. Results for the two other age groups below 18 
years were also numerically in favour of Oleogel-S10. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary analysis used a non-responder imputation for missing data. Even if the amount and 
reasons of missing data was similar in the two treatment groups, this is no guarantee that data are 
Missing at Random (MAR). Hence, a tipping point analysis evaluating robustness to any such bias was 
considered important. In the pre-planned tipping point analysis, the MI analysis on original data gave 
borderline significant results and switching the result for only one control patient resulted in a non-
significant p-value. While the applicant could explain that the missing data at the primary analysis time 
point were indeed comparably distributed over both treatments, concern was raised that in fact one 
patient in the control group that had a wound closure at D52 was treated as non-responder in the 
primary analysis. Handling of this patient as such was not agreed to and was considered anti-
conservative. This patient should have been considered as responder, and in light of a borderline 
statistical analysis, a concern was raised that treating this patient as a responder could tip the result 
when using the predefined primary analysis method and render this as insignificant. Nevertheless, the 
applicant provided an analysis demonstrating that when treating this patient as responder in the 
primary analysis, the primary analysis remained statistically significant (p=0.021). Further sensitivity 
analyses were discussed, which supported the conclusion of the primary analysis timepoint.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The results for the first key secondary endpoint were not statistically significant, hence, the results for 
the key secondary endpoints are not confirmatory. Thus, no formally demonstrated positive effects on 
wound infections, total body wound burden, itch, pain or sleep can be claimed for Filsuvez.  
Other aspects 
For the JEB/Kindler EB sub-types, the patient numbers were small (n=26 in total) and Oleogel-S10 
showed a lower rate of wound closure up to 45 days vs. the control gel (18.2% vs. 26.7%; p=0.522). 
For the DDEB sub-type, the patient numbers were also small (n=20 in total) and Oleogel-S10 showed 
a similar rate of wound closure up to 45 days vs the control gel (50% vs 50%; p=0.844). Given that a 
clinical effect is considered to be established in the study population, an indication covering both 
subtypes (DEB and JEB) was ultimately considered acceptable by the CHMP. Effectiveness of Filsuvez is 
planned to be assessed as part of the planned PASS (AEB-21), see RMP section 2.7.  
In subgroup analyses with respect to age, the youngest age group in study BEB-13 (0-<4 years) was 
very small (n=17 in total, 7 in the Oleogel-S10 group and none <12 months), which make 
interpretations uncertain. For the oldest age group (≥18 years, i.e., adults, comprising 30% of the 
study population), the results were not in favour of Oleogel-S10 (odds ratio and 95% CI: 0.86, 0.31; 
2.43). A restriction for adults and elderly is not necessary and for the youngest children, an age limit of 
6 months has been introduced in the indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/260035/2022  
Page 156/162 
 
 
 
 
 
Results with respect to race are difficult to make since 83.4% of subjects were White. Section 5.1 of 
the SmPC includes a statement on limited data available for Black and Asian patients. 
Limited additional data from the OLE study (BEB-13) have been submitted; however, the study is still 
ongoing. Thus, limited long-term efficacy data for Filsuvez are available. The BEB-13 final CSR will be 
submitted for assessment once available i.e., by Q1 2023. In the Phase 2 study, no data beyond Day 
28 were collected. If symptoms persist or worsen after use, or if wound complications occur, the 
patient’s condition should be fully clinically assessed prior to continuation of treatment, and regularly 
re-evaluated thereafter (SmPC section 4.2). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions in EB patients are wound complication (in 11.6% of 
patients), application site reaction (5.8%), wound infections (4.0%), pruritus (3.1%) and 
hypersensitivity reactions (1.3%).  
Hypersensitivity symptoms have been reported in both BEB-13 patients and in patients from the 
supportive clinical studies for the Episalvan indication of partial-thickness wounds. The same extract 
from birch bark and the same vehicle are included in Episalvan and hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or to the excipient contained in the product is a contraindication for the use of Episalvan. In 
addition, hypersensitivity and dermatitis are listed in SmPC section 4.8 of Episalvan. It is agreed that 
the same risk of hypersensitivity reactions is anticipated during the use of Filsuvez in EB patients.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data base of Oleogel-S10 in JEB and DEB patients is limited, with 109 patients treated for 
90-days in the finalised part of the pivotal BEB-13 study. The 24-month open-label follow up phase 
(OLP) with 205 EB patients is still ongoing and at present, the applicant has provided safety data with 
data lock point of 21 April 2021. On 21 April 2021, out of 205 patients who entered the ongoing BEB-
13 open label phase (OLP) 144 (70%) had completed the month 12 visit, and 68 patients (33.2%) had 
completed the 24 months visit. While there does not appear to be a difference in safety profile 
depending on age, race or gender from the data presented, there is uncertainty around this 
assumption. The meaningfulness of any sub-analyses of safety profile in BEB-13 by age is limited by 
the low numbers, with n=17 children less than 4 years of age and none less than 6 months. The 
median daily and cumulative extent of exposure for all patients and by age category are displayed in 
the SmPC section 5.1. Similarly, Asian and Black patients are poorly represented in this safety set. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC includes a statement on limited data available for Black and Asian patients. 
The missing information ‘Use in patients with different skin types regarding ethnic origin/Fitzpatrick 
skin types’ will be followed-up in the post-marketing setting as part of a PASS (AEB-21), see RMP 
section 2.7. Further, the final BEB-13 CSR will be submitted for assessment once available (i.e., by Q1 
2023). 
Adverse events recorded during clinical development program, including during the pivotal safety and 
efficacy study, are in general, those typically associated with the underlying disease. With a small 
safety set it is difficult to definitively identify a causal relationship for adverse reactions which overlap 
with complications of EB. In relation to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), it is acknowledged that the 
clinical cases presented here are not uncharacteristic for the patient population. Patients with severe 
RDEB in particular have an extremely high risk of developing aggressive SCC, which is the leading 
cause of death in this group. Nonetheless, given the concerns regarding the potential risk for local site 
carcinogenicity with a compound whose action is to accelerate re-epithelialisation, this issue is 
communicated in the product information (SmPC section 4.4).  This important potential risk will also be 
followed-up in the post-marketing setting as part of a PASS (AEB-21), see RMP section 2.7.

The gel is sterile. However, wound infection is an important and serious complication that can occur 
during wound healing. In the case of infection, it is recommended to interrupt treatment. Additional 
standard treatment may be required. This is adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.4.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
EB is a chronic condition. There are no medicinal products currently authorised for the treatment of 
any EB subtypes in the EU and therefore there is a high unmet medical need in this condition. 
Currently used treatments for EB target symptoms, with professional wound care being the mainstay 
of therapeutic intervention. The changing of dressings is painful, time consuming and stressful for 
patients. The aim of the current product, Filsuvez, is to accelerate wound healing in patients with EB. 
The more severe EB subtypes represent a large disease burden and experts/treating physicians 
generally state that ‘any improvement’ in wound healing can be of importance for the patient. This was 
strongly emphasised by experts and patient representatives at the AHEG meeting. 
The pivotal study BEB-13 met its primary efficacy endpoint as the proportion of subjects with first 
complete closure of the EB target wound within 45 days of initiating treatment was higher in the 
Assessment report

Oleogel-S10 group compared to the control gel group. Given the results of study BEB-13, an effect of 
Filsuvez has thus been established in the studied population (i.e., JEB and DEB).  
The result for the first key secondary endpoint (time to first complete closure of the target wound 
within 90 days) was not statistically significant, hence, in line with the prespecified hierarchical testing 
strategy, the results for additional key secondary endpoints are not confirmatory. Although the results 
were mostly numerically in favour of Oleogel-S10, the absolute differences were small for important 
outcomes such as total wound burden, itch or pain.  
During the consultation of the Ad-Hoc Expert Group (AHEG), the majority of the clinical experts and all 
patient representatives considered that, based on the data presented, an effect, although modest, has 
been established with Filsuvez. Moreover, the reduction of time for dressing, frequency of the dressing 
and pain reduction were also discussed during and the results presented, although limited, were 
considered to be of clinical relevance for the EB patients and carers.  
In early phases of the procedures, there was some uncertainty related to a potential, detrimental effect 
of the comparator used in the pivotal study. Collectively, however, the information from the literature 
review, the results of study AHV-18-A (clinical score and planimetry), the planimetry results in study 
AHV-18-B and the comparison with the external study suggest that the control gel did not have a 
detrimental effect on wound healing. Hence, the uncertainty related to the control gel has to the extent 
possible been alleviated. 
The observed safety profile indicates no major cause for concern apart from local, mainly wound-
related AEs and no systemic AEs. Nevertheless, the safety data base of Oleogel-S10 in JEB and DEB 
patients must be regarded as limited, even if the study was fairly large considering the orphan status 
of EB. Moreover, very limited long-term data are currently available for this chronic treatment. Further 
safety data are expected to be submitted by Q1 2023 (BEB-13 final CSR). A potential proliferative 
and/or carcinogenic effect of the product is listed as an important potential risk and will be followed as 
part of a PASS in the post-marketing setting (study AEB-21, see RMP section 2.7).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The conduct of a randomised controlled study in the rare and severe condition EB is acknowledged and 
appreciated. The overall study design is endorsed, and the study was fairly large considering the 
orphan condition, with 223 patients randomised. The study met its primary endpoint; complete closure 
of the EB target wound within 45 days of initiating treatment. The support from secondary endpoints 
was very limited, but demonstration of statistical significance for secondary endpoints is not a strict 
regulatory requirement. Even if the statistical robustness of the analysis of the primary endpoint has 
been questioned during the procedure, the CHMP concluded, in line with the recommendation of the 
AHEG, that an effect of Filsuvez has been established in the overall study population considering that 
some of the sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. Moreover, the 
effect size, albeit modest, is considered clinically meaningful. Considering the acceptable safety profile, 
it is concluded that the benefit risk balance is positive in the following indication: 
Treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa 
(EB) in patients 6 months and older. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The applicant initially applied for an indication covering all ages. However, considering the very limited 
data in the youngest age group, an indication from birth onwards was not supported and the applicant 
agreed to introduce a lower age limit of 6 months.

In addition, the applicant proposed to include both the DEB and the JEB sub-types, even though, data 
in patients with DDEB and JEB is very limited. EB experts in the AHEG considered that one cannot infer 
that a drug that works in DEB would work in JEB as well, while the patients’ representatives considered 
that any drug that overall works in EB would be considered as important for the EB patients. It was 
finally considered acceptable by the CHMP to include also the JEB subtype in the indication, given the 
established effect in the overall study population and taking into account that the mechanism of action 
does not target specific EB sub-types; however, with a cautionary statement in SmPC section 4.4 
clarifying the limited data available in the JEB and DDEB subtypes. 
Concerning the duration of treatment and when to stop treatment if an effect is not shown, the SmPC 
section 4.2 states that “If symptoms persist or worsen after use, or if wound complications occur, the 
patient’s condition should be fully clinically assessed prior to continuation of treatment, and regularly 
re-evaluated thereafter”. This wording is agreed by the CHMP. 
In the context of an orphan condition, the data submitted are considered as comprehensive 
considering that a controlled study has been performed and safety data is available for approx. 140 
patients exposed for one year. The applicant proposal for a full marketing authorisation is therefore 
accepted by the CHMP. 
Third party intervention during the evaluation of Filsuvez  
The CHMP received, during the assessment of this application, a correspondence from the EB patient 
community (hereinafter referred to as “third party”) expressing the third party’ views about the 
perspective and experience of people affected by EB, and the unmet medical need of EB patients. The 
CHMP considered this intervention in the context of its assessment and concluded that the 
observations put forward by the EB patient community were already known by CHMP, and as such had 
no impact on the CHMP assessment or its conclusions. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Filsuvez is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Filsuvez is favourable in the following indication: 
‘Treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa 
(EB) in patients 6 months and older.’ 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

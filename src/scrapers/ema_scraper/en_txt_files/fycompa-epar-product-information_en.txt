CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Fycompa (perampanel) is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of  
- 
partial-onset  seizures  (POS)  with  or  without  secondarily  generalised  seizures  in  patients  from 
4 years of age and older. 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Fycompa must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance 
between efficacy and tolerability. 
Perampanel should be taken orally once daily at bedtime. 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and 
dose. Alternate formulations of perampanel are available, including oral suspension 
Partial-Onset Seizures 
Perampanel at doses of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day has been shown to be effective therapy in partial-onset 
seizures. 
The following table summarises the recommended posology for adults, adolescents and children from 
4 years of age. More details are provided below the table.

Adults, adolescents age ≥ 12 years 
Treatment with Fycompa should be initiated at a dose of 2 mg/day. The dose may be increased based 
on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks, as per 
half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of up to 8 mg/day. Depending upon 
individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 8 mg/day, the dose may be increased up to 
12 mg/day, which may be effective in some patients (see section 4.4). Patients who are taking 
concomitant medicinal products that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should 
be titrated no more frequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal 
products that shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently 
than at 1-week intervals.

Treatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day. The dose may be increased 
based on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as 
per half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 8 mg/day. 
Depending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 8 mg/day, the dose may be 
increased by increments of 2 mg/day to 12 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal 
products that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more 
frequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that 
shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 
1-week intervals. 
Children (from 7 to 11 years of age) weighing 20 kg and < 30 kg 
Treatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day. The dose may be increased 
based on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
per half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 6 mg/day.  
Depending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 6 mg/day, the dose may be 
increased by increments of 1 mg/day to 8 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal 
products that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more 
frequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that 
shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 
1-week intervals. 
Children (from 7 to 11 years of age) weighing < 20 kg 
Treatment with Fycompa should be initiated with a dose of 1 mg/day. The dose may be increased 
based on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 1 mg (either weekly or every 2 weeks as 
per half-life considerations described below) to a maintenance dose of 2 mg/day to 4 mg/day. 
Depending upon individual clinical response and tolerability at a dose of 4 mg/day, the dose may be 
increased by increments of 0.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal 
products that do not shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more 
frequently than at 2-week intervals. Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that 
shorten the half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 
1-week intervals. 
Withdrawal 
It is recommended that discontinuation be undertaken gradually to minimise the potential for rebound 
seizures. However, due to its long half-life and subsequent slow decline in plasma concentrations, 
perampanel can be discontinued abruptly if absolutely needed. 
Missed doses 
Single missed dose: As perampanel has a long half-life, the patient should wait and take their next 
dose as scheduled. 
If more than 1 dose has been missed, for a continuous period of less than 5 half-lives (3 weeks for 
patients not taking perampanel metabolism-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (AED), 1 week for patients 
taking perampanel metabolism-inducing AEDs (see section 4.5)), consideration should be given to 
re-start treatment from the last dose level. 
If a patient has discontinued perampanel for a continuous period of more than 5 half-lives, it is 
recommended that initial dosing recommendations given above should be followed. 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
Clinical studies of Fycompa in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Analysis of safety 
information in 905 perampanel-treated elderly patients (in double-blind studies conducted in 
non-epilepsy indications) revealed no age-related differences in the safety profile. In combination with 
the lack of age-related difference in perampanel exposure, the results indicate that dose-adjustment in 
the elderly is not required. Perampanel should be used with caution in elderly taking into account the 
drug interaction potential in polymedicated patients (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild renal impairment. Use in patients with moderate 
or severe renal impairment or patients undergoing haemodialysis is not recommended. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose increases in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be based on clinical 
response and tolerability. For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, dosing can be 
initiated at 2 mg. Patients should be up-titrated using 2 mg doses no faster than every 2 weeks based 
on tolerability and effectiveness. 
Perampanel dosing for patients with mild and moderate impairment should not exceed 8 mg. 
Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of perampanel have not yet been established  in children below 4 years of age 
in the POS indication or in children below 7 years of age in the PGTCS indication. 
Method of administration 
Fycompa should be taken as single oral dose at bedtime. It may be taken with or without food (see 
section 5.2). The tablet should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. It should not be chewed, 
crushed or split. The tablets cannot be split accurately as there is no break line. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicinal 
products in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of 
anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for perampanel. 
Therefore, patients (children, adolescents, and adults) should be monitored for signs of suicidal 
ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of 
patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour 
emerge. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS) and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, 
have been reported (frequency unknown; see section 4.8) in association with perampanel treatment. 
At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored 
closely for skin reactions. 
Symptoms of DRESS include typically, although not exclusively, fever, rash associated with other 
organ system involvement, lymphadenopathy, liver function tests abnormalities and eosinophilia. It is 
important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may 
be present even though rash is not evident. 
Symptoms of SJS include typically although not exclusively, skin detachment (epidermal 
necrosis/blister) < 10%, erythematous skin (confluent), rapid progression, painful atypical target-like 
lesions and/or purpuric macules in wide dissemination or large erythema (confluent), bullous/erosive 
involvement of more than 2 mucous membranes. 
If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, perampanel should be withdrawn 
immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). 
If the patient has developed a serious reaction such as SJS or DRESS with the use of perampanel, 
treatment with perampanel must not be restarted in this patient at any time.

Absence and myoclonic seizures 
Absence and myoclonic seizures are two common generalised seizure types that frequently occur in 
IGE patients. Other AEDs are known to induce or aggravate these seizure types. Patients with 
myoclonic seizures and absence seizures should be monitored while on Fycompa. 
Nervous system disorders 
Perampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to drive or 
use machines (see section 4.7). 
Hormonal contraceptives 
At doses of 12 mg/day Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal 
contraceptives; in this circumstance additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended 
when using Fycompa (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
Falls 
There appears to be an increased risk of falls, particularly in the elderly; the underlying reason is 
unclear. 
Aggression,psychotic disorder  
Aggressive, hostile, and abnormal behaviours have been reported in patients receiving perampanel 
therapy. In perampanel-treated patients in clinical trials, aggression, anger, irritability, and psychotic 
disorder were reported more frequently at higher doses. Most of the reported events were either mild 
or moderate, and patients recovered either spontaneously or with dose adjustment. However, thoughts 
of harming others, physical assault, or threatening behaviour were observed in some patients (<1% in 
perampanel clinical trials). Homicidal ideation has been reported in patients. Patients and caregivers 
should be counselled to alert a healthcare professional immediately if significant changes in mood or 
patterns of behaviour are noted. The dosage of perampanel should be reduced if such symptoms occur 
and discontinuation should be considered if symptoms are severe (see section 4.2). 
Abuse potential 
Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of substance abuse and the patient should be 
monitored for symptoms of perampanel abuse. 
Concomitant CYP 3A inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products 
Response rates after addition of perampanel at fixed doses were less when patients received 
concomitant CYP3A enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products (carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
oxcarbazepine) as compared to response rates in patient who received concomitant 
non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products. Patients’ response should be monitored when 
they are switching from concomitant non-inducer anti-epileptic medicinal products to enzyme 
inducing medicinal products and vice versa. Depending upon individual clinical response and 
tolerability, the dose may be increased or decreased 2 mg at a time (see section 4.2). 
Other concomitant (non- anti-epileptic) cytochrome P450 inducing or inhibiting medicinal products 
Patients should be closely monitored for tolerability and clinical response when adding or removing 
cytochrome P450 inducers or inhibitors, since perampanel plasma levels can be decreased or 
increased; the dose of perampanel may need to be adjusted accordingly. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatotoxicity 
Cases of hepatotoxicity (mainly hepatic enzyme increased) with perampanel in combination with other 
antiepileptic drugs have been reported. If hepatic enzymes elevation is observed, monitoring of liver 
function should be considered. 
Excipients 
Lactose intolerance 
Fycompa tablets contains lactose, therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicine. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Fycompa is not considered a strong inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 or UGT enzymes (see 
section 5.2). 
Hormonal contraceptives 
In healthy women receiving 12 mg (but not 4 or 8 mg/day) for 21 days concomitantly with a combined 
oral contraceptive, Fycompa was shown to decrease the levonorgestrel exposure (mean Cmax and AUC 
values were each decreased by 40%). Ethinylestradiol AUC was not affected by Fycompa 12 mg 
whereas Cmax was decreased by 18%. Therefore, the possibility of decreased efficacy of hormonal 
progestative-containing contraceptives should be considered for women needing Fycompa 12 mg/day 
and an additional reliable method (intra-uterine device (IUD), condom) is to be used (see section 4.4). 
Interactions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic medicinal products 
Potential interactions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were assessed in 
clinical studies. A population PK analysis of three pooled Phase 3 studies in adolescent and adult 
patients with partial-onset seizures evaluated the effect of Fycompa (up to 12 mg once daily) on the 
PK of other AEDs. In another population PK analysis of pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in 
healthy subjects, with Fycompa up to 36 mg, and one Phase 2 and six Phase 3 studies in paediatric, 
adolescent, and adult patients with partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 
with Fycompa up to 16 mg once daily, evaluated the effect of concomitant AEDs of perampanel 
clearance. The effect of these interactions on average steady state concentration is summarised in the 
following table.

Active metabolite monohydroxycarbazepine was not assessed. 
Based on the results from the population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset 
seizures and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures the total clearance of Fycompa 
was increased when co-administered with carbamazepine (3-fold), and phenytoin or  oxcarbazepine 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2-fold), which are known inducers of enzymes of metabolism (see section 5.2). This effect should be 
taken into account and managed when adding or withdrawing these anti-epileptic drugs from a 
patient’s treatment regimen. Clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, topiramate, zonisamide, 
clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid did not affect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of 
Fycompa. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures, Fycompa did not 
affect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, topiramate, zonisamide, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid, at the 
highest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day). 
Perampanel was found to decrease the clearance of oxcarbazepine by 26%. Oxcarbazepine is rapidly 
metabolised by cytosolic reductase enzyme to the active metabolite, monohydroxycarbazepine. The 
effect of perampanel on monohydroxycarbazepine concentrations is not known. 
Perampanel is dosed to clinical effect regardless of other AEDs. 
Effect of perampanel on CYP3A substrates 
In healthy subjects, Fycompa (6 mg once daily for 20 days) decreased midazolam AUC by 13%. A 
larger decrease in exposure of midazolam (or other sensitive CYP3A substrates) at higher Fycompa 
doses cannot be excluded. 
Effect of cytochrome P450 inducers on perampanel pharmacokinetics 
Strong inducers of cytochrome P450, such as rifampicin and hypericum, are expected to decrease 
perampanel concentrations and the potential for higher plasma concentrations of reactive metabolites 
in their presence has not been excluded. Felbamate has been shown to decrease the concentrations of 
some medicinal products and may also reduce perampanel concentrations. 
Effect of cytochrome P450 inhibitors on perampanel pharmacokinetics 
In healthy subjects, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 10 days) increased 
perampanel AUC by 20% and prolonged perampanel half--life by 15% (67.8 h vs 58.4 h). Larger 
effects cannot be excluded when perampanel is combined with a CYP3A inhibitor with longer half-life 
than ketoconazole or when the inhibitor is given for a longer treatment duration. 
Levodopa 
In healthy subjects, Fycompa (4 mg once daily for 19 days) had no effect on Cmax or AUC of levodopa. 
Alcohol 
The effects of perampanel on tasks involving alertness and vigilance such as driving ability were 
additive or supra-additive to the effects of alcohol itself, as found in a pharmacodynamic interaction 
study in healthy subjects. Multiple dosing of perampanel 12 mg/day increased levels of anger, 
confusion, and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale (see 
section 5.1). These effects may also be seen when Fycompa is used in combination with other central 
nervous system (CNS) depressants. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of  adolescent patients age ≥ 12 years and children age 4 to 
11 years, there were no notable differences compared to the adult population.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential and contraception in males and females 
Fycompa is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless 
clearly necessary. Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal 
contraceptives. An additional non-hormonal form of contraception is, therefore recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amounts of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of perampanel in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but 
embryotoxicity was observed in rats at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). Fycompa is not 
recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Studies in lactating rats have shown excretion of perampanel and/or its metabolites in milk (for details 
see section 5.3). It is not known whether perampanel is excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from Fycompa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast--feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
In the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at high-dose 
(30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect the fertility and early embryonic 
development. There were no effects on male fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of perampanel on 
human fertility has not been established. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fycompa has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Perampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and, therefore, may influence the ability to drive or 
use machines. Patients are advised not to drive a vehicle, operate complex machinery or engage in 
other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether perampanel affects their ability to 
perform these tasks (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, 1,639 patients have 
received perampanel of whom 1,147 have been treated for 6 months and 703 for longer than 
12 months. 
In the controlled and uncontrolled study in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 
114 patients have received perampanel of whom 68 have been treated for 6 months and 36 for longer 
than 12 months. 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation: 
In the controlled Phase 3 partial-onset seizures clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of 
an adverse reaction was 1.7% (3/172), 4.2% (18/431) and 13.7% (35/255) in patients randomised to 
receive perampanel at the recommended doses of 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg/day, respectively, and 
1.4% (6/442) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (≥ 1% 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the total perampanel group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and 
somnolence. 
In the controlled Phase 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures clinical trial, the rate of 
discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 4.9% (4/81) in patients randomised to receive 
perampanel 8 mg, and 1.2% (1/82) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reaction 
most commonly leading to discontinuation (≥ 2% in the perampanel group and greater than placebo) 
was dizziness. 
Post-marketing use 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in association with perampanel treatment (see section 4.4).

Paediatric population 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents exposed to perampanel from double-blind 
studies for partial-onset seizures and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety 
profile in adolescents was similar to that of adults, except for aggression, which was observed more 
frequently in adolescents than in adults. 
Based on the clinical trial database of 180 paediatric patients exposed to perampanel from a 
multicentre, open label study, the overall safety profile in children was similar to that established for 
adolescents and adults, except for somnolence, irritability, aggression, and agitation which were 
observed more frequently in the paediatric study compared to studies in adolescents and adults. 
Available data in children did not suggest any clinically significant effects of perampanel on growth 
and development parameters including body weight, height, thyroid function, insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1) level, cognition (as assessed by Aldenkamp-Baker neuropsychological assessment 
schedule [ABNAS]), behaviour (as assessed by Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]), and dexterity (as 
assessed by Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test [LGPT]). However, long term effects [greater than 
1 year] on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, and puberty in children remain unknown. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There have been post-marketing cases of intentional and accidental overdose in paediatric patients 
with doses of perampanel up to 36 mg and in adult patients with doses up to 300 mg. The adverse 
reactions observed included altered mental status, agitation, aggressive behaviour, coma and depressed 
level of consciousness. The patients recovered without sequelae. 
There is no available specific antidote to the effects of perampanel. 
General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation 
of the clinical status of the patient. In view of its long half-life, the effects caused by perampanel could 
be prolonged. Because of low renal clearance special interventions such as forced diuresis, dialysis or 
haemoperfusion are unlikely to be of value.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX22 
Mechanism of action 
Perampanel is a first-in-class selective, non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons. 
Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is implicated in 
a number of neurological disorders caused by neuronal overexcitation. Activation of AMPA receptors 
by glutamate is thought to be responsible for most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In 
in vitro studies, perampanel did not compete with AMPA for binding to the AMPA receptor, but 
perampanel binding was displaced by noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists, indicating that 
perampanel is a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. In vitro, perampanel inhibited 
AMPA-induced (but not NMDA-induced) increase in intracellular calcium. In vivo, perampanel 
significantly prolonged seizure latency in an AMPA-induced seizure model. 
The precise mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be 
fully elucidated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data 
from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. In addition, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
(efficacy) analysis was performed in one efficacy trial for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. In 
both analyses, perampanel exposure is correlated with reduction in seizure frequency. 
Psychomotor performance 
Single and multiple doses of 8 mg and 12 mg impaired psychomotor performance in healthy 
volunteers in a dose-related manner. The effects of perampanel on complex tasks such as driving 
ability were additive or supra-additive to the impairment effects of alcohol. Psychomotor performance 
testing returned to baseline within 2 weeks of cessation of perampanel dosing. 
Cognitive function 
In a healthy volunteer study to assess the effects of perampanel on alertness, and memory using a 
standard battery of assessments, no effects of perampanel were found following single and multiple 
doses of perampanel up to 12 mg/day. 
In a placebo-controlled study conducted in adolescent patients, no significant changes in cognition 
relative to placebo as measured by Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score 
were observed for perampanel. In the open label extension, no significant changes were observed in 
global CDR system score after 52 weeks of perampanel treatment (see section 5.1 Paediatric 
population). 
In an open-label uncontrolled study conducted in paediatric patients, no clinically important changes 
in cognition relative to baseline as measured by ABNAS were observed following adjunctive 
perampanel therapy (see section 5.1 Paediatric population). 
Alertness and mood 
Levels of alertness (arousal) decreased in a dose-related manner in healthy subjects dosed with 
perampanel from 4 to 12 mg/day. Mood deteriorated following dosing of 12 mg/day only; the changes 
in mood were small and reflected a general lowering of alertness. Multiple dosing of perampanel 
12 mg/day also enhanced the effects of alcohol on vigilance and alertness, and increased levels of 
anger, confusion and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Perampanel did not prolong the QTc interval when administered in daily doses up to 12 mg/day, and 
did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Partial-Onset Seizures 
The efficacy of perampanel in partial-onset seizures was established in three adjunctive therapy 
19 week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials in adult and adolescent 
patients. Patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation and were not 
adequately controlled with one to three concomitant AEDs. During a 6-week baseline period, patients 
were required to have more than five seizures with no seizure-free period exceeding 25 days. In these 
three trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 21.06 years. Between 85.3% 
and 89.1% of patients were taking two to three concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal 
nerve stimulation. 
Two studies (studies 304 and 305) compared doses of perampanel 8 and 12 mg/day with placebo and 
the third study (study 306) compared doses of perampanel 2, 4 and 8 mg/day with placebo. In all three 
trials, following a 6-week Baseline Phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to 
randomisation, patients were randomised and titrated to the randomised dose. During the Titration 
Phase in all three trials, treatment was initiated at 2 mg/day and increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/day to the target dose. Patients experiencing intolerable adverse events could remain on the same 
dose or have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose. In all three trials, the Titration 
Phase was followed by a Maintenance Phase that lasted 13 weeks, during which patients were to 
remain on a stable dose of perampanel. 
The pooled 50% responder rates were placebo 19%, 4 mg 29%, 8 mg 35% and 12 mg 35%. A 
statistically significant effect on the reduction in 28-day seizure frequency (Baseline to Treatment 
Phase) as compared to the placebo group was observed with perampanel treatment at doses of 
4 mg/day (Study 306), 8 mg/day (Studies 304, 305 and 306), and 12 mg/day (Studies 304 and 305). 
The 50% responder rates in the 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg groups were respectively 23.0%, 31.5%, and 
30.0% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products and were 33.3%, 
46.5% and 50.0% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing 
anti-epileptic medicinal products. These studies show that once-daily administration of perampanel at 
doses of 4 mg to 12 mg was significantly more efficacious than placebo as adjunctive treatment in this 
population. 
Data from placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that improvement in seizure control is observed 
with a once-daily perampanel dose of 4 mg and this benefit is enhanced as the dose is increased to 
8 mg/day. No efficacy benefit was observed at the dose of 12 mg as compared to the dose of 8 mg in 
the overall population. Benefit at the dose of 12 mg was observed in some patients who tolerate the 
dose of 8 mg and when the clinical response to that dose was insufficient. A clinically meaningful 
reduction in seizure frequency relative to placebo was achieved as early as the second week of dosing 
when patients reached a daily dose of 4 mg. 
1.7 to 5.8% of the patients on perampanel in the clinical studies became seizure free during the 
3 month maintenance period compared with 0%-1.0% on placebo 
Open label extension study 
Ninety-seven percent of the patients who completed the randomised trials in patients with partial-onset 
seizures were enrolled in the open label extension study (n = 1186). Patients from the randomised trial 
were converted to perampanel over 16 weeks followed by a long-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). 
The mean average daily dose was 10.05 mg. 
Primary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures 
Perampanel as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with idiopathic generalised 
epilepsy experiencing primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures was established in a multicentre, 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 332). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 
to 3 AEDs experiencing at least 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures during the 8-week baseline 
period were randomised to either perampanel or placebo. The population included 164 patients 
(perampanel N = 82, placebo N = 82). Patients were titrated over four weeks to a target dose of 8 mg 
per day or the highest tolerated dose and treated for an additional 13 weeks on the last dose level 
achieved at the end of the titration period. The total treatment period was 17 weeks. Study drug was 
given once per day. 
The 50% primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures responder rate during the Maintenance Period was 
significantly higher in the perampanel group (58.0%) than in the placebo group (35.8%), P = 0.0059. 
The 50% responder rate was 22.2% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal 
products and was 69.4% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing 
anti-epileptic medicinal products. The number of perampanel patients taking enzyme-inducing 
anti-epileptic medicinal products was small (n = 9). The median percent change in primary generalised 
tonic-clonic seizure frequency per 28 days during the Titration and Maintenance Periods (combined) 
relative to Prerandomisation was greater with perampanel (-76.5%) than with placebo (-38.4%), 
P < 0.0001. During the 3 months maintenance period, 30.9% (25/81) of the patients on perampanel in 
the clinical studies became free of PGTC seizures compared with 12.3% (10/81) on placebo. 
Other subtypes of idiopathic generalised seizure 
The efficacy and safety of perampanel in patients with myoclonic seizures have not been established. 
The available data are insufficient to reach any conclusions. 
The efficacy of perampanel in the treatment of absence seizures has not been demonstrated. 
In Study 332, in patients with PGTC seizures who also had concomitant myoclonic seizures, freedom 
from seizures was achieved in 16.7% (4/24) on perampanel compared to 13.0% (3/23) in those on 
placebo. In patients with concomitant absence seizures, freedom from seizures was achieved in 22.2% 
(6/27) on perampanel compared to 12.1% (4/33) on placebo. Freedom from all seizures was achieved 
in 23.5% (19/81) of patients on perampanel compared to 4.9% (4/81) of patients on placebo. 
Open label extension phase 
Of the 140 patients who completed the Study 332, 114 patients (81.4%) had entered the Extension 
phase. Patients from the randomised trial were converted to perampanel over 6 weeks followed by a 
long-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). In the Extension Phase, 73.7% (84/114) of patients have a 
modal daily perampanel dose of greater than 4 to 8 mg/day and 16.7% (19/114) had a modal daily 
dose of greater than 8 to 12 mg/day. A decrease in PGTC seizure frequency of at least 50% was seen 
in 65.9% (29/44) of patients after 1 year of treatment during the Extension Phase (relative to their 
pre-perampanel baseline seizure frequency). These data were consistent with those for percent change 
in seizure frequency and showed that the PGTC 50% responder rate was generally stable across time 
from about week 26 through the end of year 2. Similar results were seen when all seizures and absence 
vs. myoclonic seizures were evaluated over time. 
Conversion to monotherapy 
In a retrospective study of clinical practice, 51 patients with epilepsy who received perampanel as 
adjunctive treatment converted to perampanel monotherapy. The majority of these patients had a 
history of partial onset seizures. Of these, 14 patients (27%) reverted to adjunctive therapy in the 
following months. Thirty four (34) patients were followed up for at least 6 months and, of these, 
24 patients (71%) remained on perampanel monotherapy for at least 6 months. Ten (10) patients were 
followed up for at least 18 months and, of these, 3 patients (30%) remained on perampanel 
monotherapy for at least 18 months. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Fycompa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment-resistant epilepsies 
(localisation-related and age-related epilepsy syndromes) (see section 4.2 for information on 
adolescent and paediatric use). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 studies included 143 adolescents between 
the ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents were similar to those seen in the adult 
population. 
Study 332 included 22 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents 
were similar to those seen in the adult population. 
A 19-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension phase 
(Study 235) was performed to assess the short-term effects on cognition of Fycompa (target dose 
range of 8 to 12 mg once daily) as adjunctive therapy in 133 (Fycompa n = 85, placebo n = 48) 
adolescent patients, aged 12 to less than 18 years old, with inadequately controlled partial-onset 
seizures. Cognitive function was assessed by the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global 
Cognition t-Score, which is a composite score derived from 5 domains testing Power of Attention, 
Continuity of Attention, Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and 
Speed of Memory. The mean change (SD) from baseline to end of double-blind treatment (19 weeks) 
in CDR System Global Cognition t-Score was 1.1 (7.14) in the placebo group and (minus) –1.0 (8.86) 
in the perampanel group, with the difference between the treatment groups in LS means 
(95% CI) = (minus) -2.2 (-5.2, 0.8). There was no statistically significant difference between the 
treatment groups (p = 0.145). CDR System Global Cognition t-Scores for placebo and perampanel 
were 41.2 (10.7) and 40.8 (13.0), respectively at the baseline. For patients with perampanel in the open 
label extension (n = 112), the mean change (SD) from baseline to end of open-label treatment 
(52 weeks) in CDR System Global Cognition t-Score was (minus) -1.0 (9.91). This was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.96). After up to 52 weeks of treatment with perampanel (n = 114), no 
effect on bone growth was observed. No effects on weight, height and sexual development were seen 
following up to 104 weeks of treatment (n = 114). 
An open-label, uncontrolled study (Study 311) was performed to assess the exposure-efficacy 
relationship of perampanel as adjunctive therapy in 180 paediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years old) 
with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. 
Patients were titrated over 11 weeks to a target dose of 8 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose (not 
to exceed 12 mg/day) for patients not taking concomitant CYP3A-inducing antiepileptic drugs 
(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine and phenytoin) or 12 mg/day or the maximum 
tolerated dose (not to exceed 16 mg/day) for patients taking a concomitant CYP3A-inducing 
antiepileptic drug.  Perampanel dose achieved at the end of titration was maintained for 12 weeks (for 
a total of 23 weeks of exposure) at the completion of the core study. Patients who entered into 
Extension Phase were treated for an additional 29 weeks for a total exposure duration of 52 weeks. 
In patients with partial-onset seizures (n = 148 patients), the median change in seizure frequency per 
28 days, the 50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate following 23 weeks of perampanel 
treatment were -40.1%, 46.6% (n = 69/148), and 11.5% (n = 17/148), respectively, for total 
partial-onset seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 108 patients, -69.4%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 62.0%, n = 67/108), and 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 13.0%, n = 14/108) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. 
In a subset of partial-onset seizure patients with secondarily generalised seizures (n = 54 patients), the 
corresponding values were -58.7%, 64.8% (n = 35/54), and 18.5% (n = 10/54), respectively, for 
secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure 
frequency (Weeks 40-52: n = 41 patients, -73.8%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 80.5%, 
n = 33/41), and seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 24.4%, n = 10/41) were sustained following 52 weeks 
of perampanel treatment. 
In patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (n = 22 patients, with 19 patients aged 
7-<12 years and 3 patients aged 4-<7 years), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days, the 
50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate were -69.2%, 63.6% (n = 14/22), and 
54.5% (n = 12/22), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 13 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 61.5%, n = 8/13), and 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 38.5%, n = 5/13) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. 
Similar results were obtained in a subset of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures of 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 19 patients, with 17 patients aged 7-<12 years and 
2 patients aged 4-<7 years; the corresponding values were -56.5%, 63.2% (n = 12/19), and 
52.6% (n = 10/19), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 11 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 54.5%, n = 6/11), and 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 36.4%, n = 4/11) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of perampanel have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 79), 
adults,  adolescents, and paediatric patients with partial-onset seizures and primary generalised 
tonic-clonic seizures, adults with Parkinson’s disease, adults with diabetic neuropathy, adults with 
multiple sclerosis, and patients with hepatic impairment. 
Absorption 
Perampanel is readily absorbed after oral administration with no evidence of marked first--pass 
metabolism. Co-administration of perampanel tablets with a high fat meal had no impact on the peak 
plasma exposure (Cmax) or total exposure (AUC0-inf) of perampanel. The tmax was delayed by 
approximately 1 hour compared to that under fasted conditions. 
Distribution 
Data from in vitro studies indicate that perampanel is approximately 95% bound to plasma proteins. 
In vitro studies show that perampanel is not a substrate or significant inhibitor of organic anion 
transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, organic anion transporters (OAT) 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
organic cation transporters (OCT) 1, 2, and 3, and the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and Breast 
Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
Biotransformation 
Perampanel is extensively metabolised via primary oxidation and sequential glucuronidation. The 
metabolism of perampanel is mediated primarily by CYP3A based on clinical study results in healthy 
subjects administered radiolabelled perampanel and supported by in vitro studies using recombinant 
human CYPs and human liver microsomes. 
Following administration of radiolabelled perampanel, only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites 
were observed in plasma. 
Elimination 
Following administration of a radiolabelled perampanel dose to either 8 healthy adults or elderly 
subjects, approximately 30% of recovered radioactivity was found in the urine and 70% in the faeces. 
In urine and faeces, recovered radioactivity was primarily composed of a mixture of oxidative and 
conjugated metabolites. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data from 19 Phase 1 
studies, the average t½ of perampanel was 105 hours. When dosed in combination with the strong 
CYP3A inducer carbamazepine, the average t½was 25 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In a population PK analysis on pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects receiving 
perampanel between 0.2 and 36 mg either as single or multiple doses, one Phase 2 and five Phase 3 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies in patients with partial-onset seizure receiving perampanel between 2 and 16 mg/day and two 
Phase 3 studies in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel 
between 2 and 14 mg/day a linear relationship was found between dose and perampanel plasma 
concentrations. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of perampanel following a single 1 mg dose were evaluated in 12 patients with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, respectively) compared with 12 healthy, 
demographically matched subjects. The mean apparent clearance of unbound perampanel in mildly 
impaired patients was 188 ml/min vs. 338 ml/min in matched controls, and in moderately impaired 
patients was 120 ml/min vs. 392 ml/min in matched controls. The t½ was longer in mildly impaired 
(306 h vs. 125 h) and moderately impaired (295 h vs. 139 h) patients compared to matched healthy 
subjects. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of perampanel have not been formally evaluated in patients with renal 
impairment. Perampanel is eliminated almost exclusively by metabolism followed by rapid excretion 
of metabolites; only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites are observed in plasma. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures having creatinine clearances ranging 
from 39 to 160 mL/min and receiving perampanel up to 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, perampanel clearance was not influenced by creatinine clearance. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving 
perampanel up to 8 mg/day in a placebo-controlled clinical study, perampanel clearance was not 
influenced by baseline creatinine clearance. 
Gender 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures receiving perampanel 
up to 12 mg/day and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel up 
to 8 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, perampanel clearance in females (0.54 l/h) was 18% 
lower than in males (0.66 l/h). 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures (age range 12 to 
74 years) and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (age range 12 to 58 years), and receiving 
perampanel up to 8 or 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, no significant effect of age on 
perampanel clearance was found. A dose adjustment in the elderly is not considered to be necessary 
(see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis on pooled data from children aged 4 to 11 years, adolescent 
patients aged ≥12 years, and adults, perampanel clearance increased with an increase in body weight.  
Hence, dose adjustment in children aged 4 to 11 years with a body weight < 30 kg is necessary (see 
section 4.2). 
Drug interaction studies 
In vitro assessment of drug interactions 
Drug metabolising enzyme inhibition 
In human liver microsomes, perampanel (30 µmol/l) had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 and 
UGT1A9 among major hepatic CYPs and UGTs. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drug metabolising enzyme induction 
Compared with positive controls (including phenobarbital, rifampicin), perampanel was found to 
weakly induce CYP2B6 (30 µmol/l) and CYP3A4/5 (≥ 3 µmol/l) among major hepatic CYPs and 
UGTs in cultured human hepatocytes. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
In the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at the maximum 
tolerated dose (30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect fertility and early 
embryonic development. There were no effects on male fertility. 
The excretion into breast milk was measured in rats at 10 days post-partum. Levels peaked at one hour 
and were 3.65 times the levels in plasma. 
In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in rats, abnormal delivery and nursing conditions 
were observed at maternally toxic doses, and the number of stillbirths was increased in offspring. 
Behavioural and reproductive development of the offspring was not affected, but some parameters of 
physical development showed some delay, which is probably secondary to the pharmacology-based 
CNS effects of perampanel. The placental transfer was relatively low; 0.09% or less of administered 
dose was detected in the foetus. 
Nonclinical data reveal that perampanel was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. The 
administration of maximum tolerated doses to rats and monkeys resulted in pharmacologically-based 
CNS clinical signs and decreased terminal body weight. There were no changes directly attributable to 
perampanel in clinical pathology or histopathology.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Fycompa must be titrated, according to individual patient response, in order to optimise the balance 
between efficacy and tolerability. 
Perampanel suspension should be taken orally once daily at bedtime. 
It may be taken with or without food, but preferably always under the same conditions. Switching 
between the tablet and suspension formulation should be done with caution (see section 5.2). 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and 
dose. 
Partial-Onset Seizures 
Perampanel at doses of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day has been shown to be effective therapy in partial-onset 
seizures.

6 mg/day (12 ml/day). Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that do not shorten the 
half-life of perampanel (see section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 2-week intervals. 
Patients who are taking concomitant medicinal products that shorten the half-life of perampanel (see 
section 4.5) should be titrated no more frequently than at 1-week intervals. 
Withdrawal 
It is recommended that discontinuation be undertaken gradually to minimise the potential for rebound 
seizures. However, due to its long half-life and subsequent slow decline in plasma concentrations, 
perampanel can be discontinued abruptly if absolutely needed. 
Missed doses 
Single missed dose: As perampanel has a long half-life, the patient should wait and take their next 
dose as scheduled. 
If more than 1 dose has been missed, for a continuous period of less than 5 half-lives (3 weeks for 
patients not taking perampanel metabolism-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (AED), 1 week for patients 
taking perampanel metabolism-inducing AEDs (see section 4.5)), consideration should be given to 
re-start treatment from the last dose level. 
If a patient has discontinued perampanel for a continuous period of more than 5 half-lives, it is 
recommended that initial dosing recommendations given above should be followed. 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
Clinical studies of Fycompa in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Analysis of safety 
information in 905 perampanel-treated elderly patients (in double-blind studies conducted in 
non-epilepsy indications) revealed no age-related differences in the safety profile. In combination with 
the lack of age-related difference in perampanel exposure, the results indicate that dose-adjustment in 
the elderly is not required. Perampanel should be used with caution in elderly taking into account the 
drug interaction potential in polymedicated patients (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild renal impairment. Use in patients with moderate 
or severe renal impairment or patients undergoing haemodialysis is not recommended. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose increases in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be based on clinical 
response and tolerability. For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, dosing can be 
initiated at 2 mg (4 ml). Patients should be up-titrated using 2 mg (4 ml) doses no faster than every 
2 weeks based on tolerability and effectiveness. 
Perampanel dosing for patients with mild and moderate impairment should not exceed 8 mg. 
Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of perampanel have not yet been established in children below 4 years of age 
in the POS indication or in children below 7 years of age in the PGTCS indication.  
Method of administration 
Fycompa is for oral use. 
Preparation: The press-in-bottle adapter (PIBA) which is supplied in the product carton should be 
inserted firmly into the neck of the bottle before use and remain in place for the duration of the usage 
of the bottle. The oral syringe should be inserted into the PIBA and the dose withdrawn from the 
inverted bottle. The cap should be replaced after each use. The cap fits properly when the PIBA is in 
place. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicinal 
products in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of 
anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for perampanel. 
Therefore, patients (children, adolescents, and adults) should be monitored for signs of suicidal 
ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of 
patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour 
emerge. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS) and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, 
have been reported (frequency unknown; see section 4.8) in association with perampanel treatment. 
At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored 
closely for skin reactions. 
Symptoms of DRESS include typically, although not exclusively, fever, rash associated with other 
organ system involvement, lymphadenopathy, liver function tests abnormalities and eosinophilia. It is 
important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may 
be present even though rash is not evident. 
Symptoms of SJS include typically although not exclusively, skin detachment (epidermal 
necrosis/blister) < 10%, erythematous skin (confluent), rapid progression, painful atypical target-like 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lesions and/or purpuric macules in wide dissemination or large erythema (confluent), bullous/erosive 
involvement of more than 2 mucous membranes. 
If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, perampanel should be withdrawn 
immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate). 
If the patient has developed a serious reaction such as SJS or DRESS with the use of perampanel, 
treatment with perampanel must not be restarted in this patient at any time. 
Absence and myoclonic seizures 
Absence and myoclonic seizures are two common generalised seizure types that frequently occur in 
IGE patients. Other AEDs are known to induce or aggravate these seizure types. Patients with 
myoclonic seizures and absence seizures should be monitored while on Fycompa. 
Nervous system disorders 
Perampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to drive or 
use machines (see section 4.7). 
Hormonal contraceptives 
At doses of 12 mg/day Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal 
contraceptives; in this circumstance additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended 
when using Fycompa (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
Falls 
There appears to be an increased risk of falls, particularly in the elderly; the underlying reason is 
unclear. 
Aggression, psychotic disorder 
Aggressive, hostile, and abnormal behaviours have been reported in patients receiving perampanel 
therapy. In perampanel-treated patients in clinical trials, aggression, anger, irritability, and psychotic 
disorder were reported more frequently at higher doses. Most of the reported events were either mild 
or moderate, and patients recovered either spontaneously or with dose adjustment. However, thoughts 
of harming others, physical assault, or threatening behaviour were observed in some patients (<1% in 
perampanel clinical trials). Homicidal ideation has been reported in patients. Patients and caregivers 
should be counselled to alert a healthcare professional immediately if significant changes in mood or 
patterns of behaviour are noted. The dosage of perampanel should be reduced if such symptoms occur 
and discontinuation should be considered if symptoms are severe (see section 4.2). 
Abuse potential 
Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of substance abuse and the patient should be 
monitored for symptoms of perampanel abuse. 
Concomitant CYP 3A inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products 
Response rates after addition of perampanel at fixed doses were less when patients received 
concomitant CYP3A enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products (carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
oxcarbazepine) as compared to response rates in patient who received concomitant 
non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products. Patients’ response should be monitored when 
they are switching from concomitant non-inducer anti-epileptic medicinal products to enzyme 
inducing medicinal products and vice versa. Depending upon individual clinical response and 
tolerability, the dose may be increased or decreased 2 mg at a time (see section 4.2). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other concomitant (non- anti-epileptic) cytochrome P450 inducing or inhibiting medicinal products 
Patients should be closely monitored for tolerability and clinical response when adding or removing 
cytochrome P450 inducers or inhibitors, since perampanel plasma levels can be decreased or 
increased; the dose of perampanel may need to be adjusted accordingly. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Cases of hepatotoxicity (mainly hepatic enzyme increased) with perampanel in combination with other 
antiepileptic drugs have been reported. If hepatic enzymes elevation is observed, monitoring of liver 
function should be considered. 
Excipients 
Fructose intolerance 
Fycompa contains sorbitol (E420), each mL of Fycompa contains 175 mg sorbitol. 
Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. 
Caution should be exercised when combining Fycompa oral suspension with other antiepileptic 
medications containing sorbitol, since a combined intake of over 1 gram of sorbitol may affect 
absorption of some drugs. 
Benzoic Acid (E210) and Sodium Benzoate (E211) 
Fycompa contains benzoic acid (E210) and sodium benzoate (E211), each mL of Fycompa contains 
<0.005 mg benzoic acid and 1.1 mg sodium benzoate. 
Benzoic acid and benzoates can displace bilirubin from albumin.  Increase in bilirubinaemia following 
its displacement from albumin may increase neonatal jaundice which may develop into kernicterus. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Fycompa is not considered a strong inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 or UGT enzymes (see 
section 5.2). 
Hormonal contraceptives 
In healthy women receiving 12 mg (but not 4 or 8 mg/day) for 21 days concomitantly with a combined 
oral contraceptive, Fycompa was shown to decrease the levonorgestrel exposure (mean Cmax and AUC 
values were each decreased by 40%). Ethinylestradiol AUC was not affected by Fycompa 12 mg 
whereas Cmax was decreased by 18%. Therefore, the possibility of decreased efficacy of hormonal 
progestative-containing contraceptives should be considered for women needing Fycompa 12 mg/day 
and an additional reliable method (intra-uterine device (IUD), condom) is to be used (see section 4.4). 
Interactions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic medicinal products 
Potential interactions between Fycompa and other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were assessed in 
clinical studies. A population PK analysis of three pooled Phase 3 studies in adolescent and adult 
patients with partial-onset seizures evaluated the effect of Fycompa (up to 12 mg once daily) on the 
PK of other AEDs. In another population PK analysis of pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in 
healthy subjects, with Fycompa up to 36 mg, and one Phase 2 and six Phase 3 studies in  paediatric, 
adolescent and adult patients with partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 
with Fycompa up to 16 mg once daily, evaluated the effect of concomitant AEDs of perampanel 
clearance. The effect of these interactions on average steady state concentration is summarised in the 
following table.

Active metabolite monohydroxycarbazepine was not assessed. 
Based on the results from the population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset 
seizures and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures the total clearance of Fycompa 
was increased when co-administered with carbamazepine (3-fold), and phenytoin or oxcarbazepine 
(2-fold), which are known inducers of enzymes of metabolism (see section 5.2). This effect should be 
taken into account and managed when adding or withdrawing these anti-epileptic drugs from a 
patient’s treatment regimen. Clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, topiramate, zonisamide, 
clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid did not affect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of 
Fycompa. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures, Fycompa did not 
affect to a clinically relevant manner the clearance of clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, topiramate, zonisamide, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid, at the 
highest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day). 
Perampanel was found to decrease the clearance of oxcarbazepine by 26%. Oxcarbazepine is rapidly 
metabolised by cytosolic reductase enzyme to the active metabolite, monohydroxycarbazepine. The 
effect of perampanel on monohydroxycarbazepine concentrations is not known. 
Perampanel is dosed to clinical effect regardless of other AEDs. 
Effect of perampanel on CYP3A substrates 
In healthy subjects, Fycompa (6 mg once daily for 20 days) decreased midazolam AUC by 13%. A 
larger decrease in exposure of midazolam (or other sensitive CYP3A substrates) at higher Fycompa 
doses cannot be excluded. 
Effect of cytochrome P450 inducers on perampanel pharmacokinetics 
Strong inducers of cytochrome P450, such as rifampicin and hypericum, are expected to decrease 
perampanel concentrations and the potential for higher plasma concentrations of reactive metabolites 
in their presence has not been excluded. Felbamate has been shown to decrease the concentrations of 
some medicinal products and may also reduce perampanel concentrations. 
Effect of cytochrome P450 inhibitors on perampanel pharmacokinetics 
In healthy subjects, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 10 days) increased 
perampanel AUC by 20% and prolonged perampanel half--life by 15% (67.8 h vs 58.4 h). Larger 
effects cannot be excluded when perampanel is combined with a CYP3A inhibitor with longer half-life 
than ketoconazole or when the inhibitor is given for a longer treatment duration. 
Levodopa 
In healthy subjects, Fycompa (4 mg once daily for 19 days) had no effect on Cmax or AUC of levodopa. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alcohol 
The effects of perampanel on tasks involving alertness and vigilance such as driving ability were 
additive or supra-additive to the effects of alcohol itself, as found in a pharmacodynamic interaction 
study in healthy subjects. Multiple dosing of perampanel 12 mg/day increased levels of anger, 
confusion, and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale (see 
section 5.1). These effects may also be seen when Fycompa is used in combination with other central 
nervous system (CNS) depressants. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of adolescent patients age ≥ 12 years and children age 4 to 
11 years, there were no notable differences compared to the adult population. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential and contraception in males and females 
Fycompa is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless 
clearly necessary. Fycompa may decrease the effectiveness of progestative-containing hormonal 
contraceptives. An additional non-hormonal form of contraception is, therefore recommended (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amounts of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of perampanel in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but 
embryotoxicity was observed in rats at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). Fycompa is not 
recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Studies in lactating rats have shown excretion of perampanel and/or its metabolites in milk (for details 
see section 5.3). It is not known whether perampanel is excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from Fycompa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast--feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
In the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at high-dose 
(30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect the fertility and early embryonic 
development. There were no effects on male fertility (see section 5.3). The effect of perampanel on 
human fertility has not been established. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fycompa has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Perampanel may cause dizziness and somnolence and, therefore, may influence the ability to drive or 
use machines. Patients are advised not to drive a vehicle, operate complex machinery or engage in 
other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether perampanel affects their ability to 
perform these tasks (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In all controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, 1,639 patients have 
received perampanel of whom 1,147 have been treated for 6 months and 703 for longer than 
12 months. 
In the controlled and uncontrolled study in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 
114 patients have received perampanel of whom 68 have been treated for 6 months and 36 for longer 
than 12 months. 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation: 
In the controlled Phase 3 partial-onset seizures clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of 
an adverse reaction was 1.7% (3/172), 4.2% (18/431) and 13.7% (35/255) in patients randomised to 
receive perampanel at the recommended doses of 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg/day, respectively, and 
1.4% (6/442) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (≥ 1% 
in the total perampanel group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and 
somnolence. 
In the controlled Phase 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures clinical trial, the rate of 
discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 4.9% (4/81) in patients randomised to receive 
perampanel 8 mg, and 1.2% (1/82) in patients randomised to receive placebo. The adverse reaction 
most commonly leading to discontinuation (≥ 2% in the perampanel group and greater than placebo) 
was dizziness. 
Post-marketing use 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in association with perampanel treatment (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the full Fycompa 
clinical studies safety database, are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. The following

Fall 
Based on the clinical trial database of 196 adolescents exposed to perampanel from double-blind 
studies for partial-onset seizures and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, the overall safety 
profile in adolescents was similar to that of adults, except for aggression, which was observed more 
frequently in adolescents than in adults. 
Based on the clinical trial database of 180 paediatric patients exposed to perampanel from a 
multicentre, open label study, the overall safety profile in children was similar to that established for 
adolescents and adults, except for somnolence, irritability, aggression, and agitation, which were 
observed more frequently in the paediatric study compared to studies in adolescents and adults. 
Available data in children did not suggest any clinically significant effects of perampanel on growth 
and development parameters including body weight, height, thyroid function, insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1) level, cognition (as assessed by Aldenkamp-Baker neuropsychological assessment 
schedule [ABNAS]), behaviour (as assessed by Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]), and dexterity (as 
assessed by Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test [LGPT]). However, long term effects [greater than 
1 year] on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, and puberty in children remain unknown. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There have been post-marketing cases of intentional and accidental overdose in paediatric patients 
with doses of perampanel up to 36 mg and in adult patients with doses up to 300 mg. The adverse 
reactions observed included altered mental status, agitation, aggressive behaviour, coma and depressed 
level of consciousness. The patients recovered without sequelae. 
There is no available specific antidote to the effects of perampanel.

General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation 
of the clinical status of the patient. In view of its long half-life, the effects caused by perampanel could 
be prolonged. Because of low renal clearance special interventions such as forced diuresis, dialysis or 
haemoperfusion are unlikely to be of value.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX22 
Mechanism of action 
Perampanel is a first-in-class selective, non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic neurons. 
Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is implicated in 
a number of neurological disorders caused by neuronal overexcitation. Activation of AMPA receptors 
by glutamate is thought to be responsible for most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In 
in vitro studies, perampanel did not compete with AMPA for binding to the AMPA receptor, but 
perampanel binding was displaced by noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists, indicating that 
perampanel is a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. In vitro, perampanel inhibited 
AMPA-induced (but not NMDA-induced) increase in intracellular calcium. In vivo, perampanel 
significantly prolonged seizure latency in an AMPA-induced seizure model. 
The precise mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be 
fully elucidated. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data 
from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. In addition, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
(efficacy) analysis was performed in one efficacy trial for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. In 
both analyses, perampanel exposure is correlated with reduction in seizure frequency. 
Psychomotor performance 
Single and multiple doses of 8 mg and 12 mg impaired psychomotor performance in healthy 
volunteers in a dose-related manner. The effects of perampanel on complex tasks such as driving 
ability were additive or supra-additive to the impairment effects of alcohol. Psychomotor performance 
testing returned to baseline within 2 weeks of cessation of perampanel dosing. 
Cognitive function 
In a healthy volunteer study to assess the effects of perampanel on alertness, and memory using a 
standard battery of assessments, no effects of perampanel were found following single and multiple 
doses of perampanel up to 12 mg/day. 
In a placebo-controlled study conducted in adolescent patients, no significant changes in cognition 
relative to placebo as measured by Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score 
were observed for perampanel. In the open label extension, no significant changes were observed in 
global CDR system score after 52 weeks of perampanel treatment (see section 5.1 Paediatric 
population). 
In an open-label uncontrolled study conducted in paediatric patients, no clinically important changes 
in cognition relative to baseline as measured by ABNAS were observed following adjunctive 
perampanel (see section 5.1 Paediatric population). 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alertness and mood 
Levels of alertness (arousal) decreased in a dose-related manner in healthy subjects dosed with 
perampanel from 4 to 12 mg/day. Mood deteriorated following dosing of 12 mg/day only; the changes 
in mood were small and reflected a general lowering of alertness. Multiple dosing of perampanel 
12 mg/day also enhanced the effects of alcohol on vigilance and alertness, and increased levels of 
anger, confusion and depression as assessed using the Profile of Mood State 5-point rating scale. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Perampanel did not prolong the QTc interval when administered in daily doses up to 12 mg/day, and 
did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Partial-Onset Seizures 
The efficacy of perampanel in partial-onset seizures was established in three adjunctive therapy 
19 week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials in adult and adolescent 
patients. Patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation and were not 
adequately controlled with one to three concomitant AEDs. During a 6-week baseline period, patients 
were required to have more than five seizures with no seizure-free period exceeding 25 days. In these 
three trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 21.06 years. Between 85.3% 
and 89.1% of patients were taking two to three concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal 
nerve stimulation. 
Two studies (studies 304 and 305) compared doses of perampanel 8 and 12 mg/day with placebo and 
the third study (study 306) compared doses of perampanel 2, 4 and 8 mg/day with placebo. In all three 
trials, following a 6-week Baseline Phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to 
randomisation, patients were randomised and titrated to the randomised dose. During the Titration 
Phase in all three trials, treatment was initiated at 2 mg/day and increased in weekly increments of 
2 mg/day to the target dose. Patients experiencing intolerable adverse events could remain on the same 
dose or have their dose decreased to the previously tolerated dose. In all three trials, the Titration 
Phase was followed by a Maintenance Phase that lasted 13 weeks, during which patients were to 
remain on a stable dose of perampanel. 
The pooled 50% responder rates were placebo 19%, 4 mg 29%, 8 mg 35% and 12 mg 35%. A 
statistically significant effect on the reduction in 28-day seizure frequency (Baseline to Treatment 
Phase) as compared to the placebo group was observed with perampanel treatment at doses of 
4 mg/day (Study 306), 8 mg/day (Studies 304, 305 and 306), and 12 mg/day (Studies 304 and 305). 
The 50% responder rates in the 4 mg, 8 mg and 12 mg groups were respectively 23.0%, 31.5%, and 
30.0% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal products and were 33.3%, 
46.5% and 50.0% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing 
anti-epileptic medicinal products. These studies show that once-daily administration of perampanel at 
doses of 4 mg to 12 mg was significantly more efficacious than placebo as adjunctive treatment in this 
population. 
Data from placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that improvement in seizure control is observed 
with a once-daily perampanel dose of 4 mg and this benefit is enhanced as the dose is increased to 
8 mg/day. No efficacy benefit was observed at the dose of 12 mg as compared to the dose of 8 mg in 
the overall population. Benefit at the dose of 12 mg was observed in some patients who tolerate the 
dose of 8 mg and when the clinical response to that dose was insufficient. A clinically meaningful 
reduction in seizure frequency relative to placebo was achieved as early as the second week of dosing 
when patients reached a daily dose of 4 mg. 
1.7 to 5.8% of the patients on perampanel in the clinical studies became seizure free during the 
3 month maintenance period compared with 0%-1.0% on placebo. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Open label extension study 
Ninety-seven percent of the patients who completed the randomised trials in patients with partial-onset 
seizures were enrolled in the open label extension study (n = 1186). Patients from the randomised trial 
were converted to perampanel over 16 weeks followed by a long-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). 
The mean average daily dose was 10.05 mg. 
Primary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures 
Perampanel as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with idiopathic generalised 
epilepsy experiencing primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures was established in a multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 332). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 
to 3 AEDs experiencing at least 3 primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures during the 8-week baseline 
period were randomised to either perampanel or placebo. The population included 164 patients 
(perampanel N = 82, placebo N = 82). Patients were titrated over four weeks to a target dose of 8 mg 
per day or the highest tolerated dose and treated for an additional 13 weeks on the last dose level 
achieved at the end of the titration period. The total treatment period was 17 weeks. Study drug was 
given once per day. 
The 50% primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures responder rate during the Maintenance Period was 
significantly higher in the perampanel group (58.0%) than in the placebo group (35.8%), P = 0.0059. 
The 50% responder rate was 22.2% in combination with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medicinal 
products and was 69.4% when perampanel was given in combination with non-enzyme-inducing 
anti-epileptic medicinal products. The number of perampanel patients taking enzyme-inducing 
anti-epileptic medicinal products was small (n = 9). The median percent change in primary generalised 
tonic-clonic seizure frequency per 28 days during the Titration and Maintenance Periods (combined) 
relative to Prerandomisation was greater with perampanel (-76.5%) than with placebo (-38.4%), 
P < 0.0001. During the 3 months maintenance period, 30.9% (25/81) of the patients on perampanel in 
the clinical studies became free of PGTC seizures compared with 12.3% (10/81) on placebo. 
Other subtypes of idiopathic generalised seizure 
The efficacy and safety of perampanel in patients with myoclonic seizures have not been established. 
The available data are insufficient to reach any conclusions. 
The efficacy of perampanel in the treatment of absence seizures has not been demonstrated. 
In Study 332, in patients with PGTC seizures who also had concomitant myoclonic seizures, freedom 
from seizures was achieved in 16.7% (4/24) on perampanel compared to 13.0% (3/23) in those on 
placebo. In patients with concomitant absence seizures, freedom from seizures was achieved in 22.2% 
(6/27) on perampanel compared to 12.1% (4/33) on placebo. Freedom from all seizures was achieved 
in 23.5% (19/81) of patients on perampanel compared to 4.9% (4/81) of patients on placebo. 
Open label extension phase 
Of the 140 patients who completed the Study 332, 114 patients (81.4%) had entered the Extension 
phase. Patients from the randomised trial were converted to perampanel over 6 weeks followed by a 
long-term maintenance period (≥ 1 year). In the Extension Phase, 73.7% (84/114) of patients have a 
modal daily perampanel dose of greater than 4 to 8 mg/day and 16.7% (19/114) had a modal daily 
dose of greater than 8 to 12 mg/day. A decrease in PGTC seizure frequency of at least 50% was seen 
in 65.9% (29/44) of patients after 1 year of treatment during the Extension Phase (relative to their 
pre-perampanel baseline seizure frequency). These data were consistent with those for percent change 
in seizure frequency and showed that the PGTC 50% responder rate was generally stable across time 
from about week 26 through the end of year 2. Similar results were seen when all seizures and absence 
vs. myoclonic seizures were evaluated over time. 
Conversion to monotherapy 
In a retrospective study of clinical practice, 51 patients with epilepsy who received perampanel as 
adjunctive treatment converted to perampanel monotherapy. The majority of these patients had a 
history of partial onset seizures. Of these, 14 patients (27%) reverted to adjunctive therapy in the 
following months. Thirty four (34) patients were followed up for at least 6 months and, of these, 
24 patients (71%) remained on perampanel monotherapy for at least 6 months. Ten (10) patients were 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
followed up for at least 18 months and, of these, 3 patients (30%) remained on perampanel 
monotherapy for at least 18 months. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Fycompa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment-resistant epilepsies 
(localisation-related and age-related epilepsy syndromes) (see section 4.2 for information on 
adolescent and paediatric use). 
The three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 studies included 143 adolescents between 
the ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents were similar to those seen in the adult 
population. 
Study 332 included 22 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18. The results in these adolescents 
were similar to those seen in the adult population. 
A 19-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension phase 
(Study 235) was performed to assess the short-term effects on cognition of Fycompa (target dose 
range of 8 to 12 mg once daily) as adjunctive therapy in 133 (Fycompa n = 85, placebo n = 48) 
adolescent patients, aged 12 to less than 18 years old, with inadequately controlled partial-onset 
seizures. Cognitive function was assessed by the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System Global 
Cognition t-Score, which is a composite score derived from 5 domains testing Power of Attention, 
Continuity of Attention, Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and 
Speed of Memory. The mean change (SD) from baseline to end of double-blind treatment (19 weeks) 
in CDR System Global Cognition t-Score was 1.1 (7.14) in the placebo group and (minus) –1.0 (8.86) 
in the perampanel group, with the difference between the treatment groups in LS means 
(95% CI) = (minus) -2.2 (-5.2, 0.8). There was no statistically significant difference between the 
treatment groups (p = 0.145). CDR System Global Cognition t-Scores for placebo and perampanel 
were 41.2 (10.7) and 40.8 (13.0), respectively at the baseline. For patients with perampanel in the open 
label extension (n = 112), the mean change (SD) from baseline to end of open-label treatment 
(52 weeks) in CDR System Global Cognition t-Score was (minus) -1.0 (9.91). This was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.96). After up to 52 weeks of treatment with perampanel (n = 114), no 
effect on bone growth was observed. No effects on weight, height and sexual development were seen 
following up to 104 weeks of treatment (n = 114). 
An open-label, uncontrolled study (Study 311) was performed to assess the exposure-efficacy 
relationship of perampanel as adjunctive therapy in 180 paediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years old) 
with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. 
Patients were titrated over 11 weeks to a target dose of 8 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose (not 
to exceed 12 mg/day) for patients not taking concomitant CYP3A-inducing antiepileptic drugs 
(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine and phenytoin) or 12 mg/day or the maximum 
tolerated dose (not to exceed 16 mg/day) for patients taking a concomitant CYP3A-inducing 
antiepileptic drug. Perampanel dose achieved at the end of titration was maintained for 12 weeks (for a 
total of 23 weeks of exposure) at the completion of the core study. Patients who entered into Extension 
Phase were treated for an additional 29 weeks for a total exposure duration of 52 weeks. 
In patients with partial-onset seizures (n = 148 patients), the median change in seizure frequency per 
28 days, the 50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate following 23 weeks of perampanel 
treatment were -40.1%, 46.6% (n = 69/148), and 11.5% (n = 17/148), respectively, for total 
partial-onset seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 108 patients, -69.4%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 62.0%, n = 67/108), and 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 13.0%, n = 14/108) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. 
In a subset of partial-onset seizure patients with secondarily generalised seizures, the corresponding 
values were -58.7%, 64.8% (n = 35/54), and 18.5% (n = 10/54), respectively, for secondarily 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 41 patients, -73.8%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 80.5%, n = 33/41), and 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 24.4%, n = 10/41) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. 
In patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (n = 22 patients, with 19 patients aged 
7-<12 years and 3 patients aged 4-<7 years), the median change in seizure frequency per 28 days, the 
50% or greater responder rate, and seizure-free rate were -69.2%, 63.6% ( n = 14/22), and 
54.5% (n = 12/22), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 13 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 61.5%, n = 8/13), and 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 38.5%, n = 5/13) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. 
Similar results were obtained in a subset of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures of 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 19 patients, with 17 patients aged 7-<12 years and 
2 patients aged 4-<7 years; the corresponding values were -56.5%, 63.2% (n = 12/19), and 
52.6% (n = 10/19), respectively. The treatment effects on the median reduction in seizure frequency 
(Weeks 40-52: n = 11 patients, -100.0%), 50% responder rate (Weeks 40-52: 54.5%, n = 6/11), and 
seizure-free rate (Weeks 40-52: 36.4%, n = 4/11) were sustained following 52 weeks of perampanel 
treatment. These results should be considered cautiously as the number of patients is very small. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of perampanel have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 79), 
adults, adolescents, and paediatric patients with partial-onset seizures and primary generalised 
tonic-clonic seizures, adults with Parkinson’s disease, adults with diabetic neuropathy, adults with 
multiple sclerosis, and patients with hepatic impairment. 
Absorption 
Perampanel is readily absorbed after oral administration with no evidence of marked first-pass 
metabolism. 
Perampanel oral suspension is bioequivalent on a mg per mg basis to perampanel tablets under fasted 
conditions. When a single 12-mg dose of both formulations was administered with a high fat meal, 
perampanel oral suspension achieves equivalent AUC0-inf and approximately 23 % lower Cmax and 
2 hours delay in time to peak exposure (tmax) compared to the tablet formulation. However, population 
pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that under simulated steady state exposure conditions, Cmax 
and AUC(0-24h), of perampanel oral suspension were bioequivalent to the tablet formulation under both 
fasted and fed conditions. 
When coadministered with a high fat meal, Cmax and AUC0-inf of a single 12-mg dose of perampanel 
oral suspension were approximately 22% and 13%, respectively, lower compared to fasted conditions. 
Distribution 
Data from in vitro studies indicate that perampanel is approximately 95% bound to plasma proteins. 
In vitro studies show that perampanel is not a substrate or significant inhibitor of organic anion 
transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, organic anion transporters (OAT) 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
organic cation transporters (OCT) 1, 2, and 3, and the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and Breast 
Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Perampanel is extensively metabolised via primary oxidation and sequential glucuronidation. The 
metabolism of perampanel is mediated primarily by CYP3A based on clinical study results in healthy 
subjects administered radiolabelled perampanel and supported by in vitro studies using recombinant 
human CYPs and human liver microsomes. 
Following administration of radiolabelled perampanel, only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites 
were observed in plasma. 
Elimination 
Following administration of a radiolabelled perampanel dose to either 8 healthy adults or elderly 
subjects, approximately 30% of recovered radioactivity was found in the urine and 70% in the faeces. 
In urine and faeces, recovered radioactivity was primarily composed of a mixture of oxidative and 
conjugated metabolites. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data from 19 Phase 1 
studies, the average t½ of perampanel was 105 hours. When dosed in combination with the strong 
CYP3A inducer carbamazepine, the average t½was 25 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In a population PK analysis on pooled data from twenty Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects receiving 
perampanel between 0.2 and 36 mg either as single or multiple doses, one Phase 2 and five Phase 3 
studies in patients with partial-onset seizure receiving perampanel between 2 and 16 mg/day and two 
Phase 3 studies in patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel 
between 2 and 14 mg/day a linear relationship was found between dose and perampanel plasma 
concentrations. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of perampanel following a single 1 mg dose were evaluated in 12 patients with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, respectively) compared with 12 healthy, 
demographically matched subjects. The mean apparent clearance of unbound perampanel in mildly 
impaired patients was 188 ml/min vs. 338 ml/min in matched controls, and in moderately impaired 
patients was 120 ml/min vs. 392 ml/min in matched controls. The t½ was longer in mildly impaired 
(306 h vs. 125 h) and moderately impaired (295 h vs. 139 h) patients compared to matched healthy 
subjects. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of perampanel have not been formally evaluated in patients with renal 
impairment. Perampanel is eliminated almost exclusively by metabolism followed by rapid excretion 
of metabolites; only trace amounts of perampanel metabolites are observed in plasma. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures having creatinine clearances ranging 
from 39 to 160 mL/min and receiving perampanel up to 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical 
trials, perampanel clearance was not influenced by creatinine clearance. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving 
perampanel up to 8 mg/day in a placebo-controlled clinical study, perampanel clearance was not 
influenced by baseline creatinine clearance. 
Gender 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures receiving perampanel 
up to 12 mg/day and patients with primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures receiving perampanel up 
to 8 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, perampanel clearance in females (0.54 l/h) was 18% 
lower than in males (0.66 l/h). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with partial-onset seizures (age range 12 to 
74 years) and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (age range 12 to 58 years), and receiving 
perampanel up to 8 or 12 mg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials, no significant effect of age on 
perampanel clearance was found. A dose adjustment in the elderly is not considered to be necessary 
(see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis on pooled data from children aged 4 to 11 years, adolescent 
patients aged ≥12 years, and adults, perampanel clearance increased with an increase in body weight.  
Hence, dose adjustment in children aged 4 to 11 years with a body weight < 30 kg is necessary (see 
section 4.2). 
Drug interaction studies 
In vitro assessment of drug interactions 
Drug metabolising enzyme inhibition 
In human liver microsomes, perampanel (30 µmol/l) had a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 and 
UGT1A9 among major hepatic CYPs and UGTs. 
Drug metabolising enzyme induction 
Compared with positive controls (including phenobarbital, rifampicin), perampanel was found to 
weakly induce CYP2B6 (30 µmol/l) and CYP3A4/5 (≥ 3 µmol/l) among major hepatic CYPs and 
UGTs in cultured human hepatocytes. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
In the fertility study in rats, prolonged and irregular oestrous cycles were observed at the maximum 
tolerated dose (30 mg/kg) in females; however, these changes did not affect fertility and early 
embryonic development. There were no effects on male fertility. 
The excretion into breast milk was measured in rats at 10 days post-partum. Levels peaked at one hour 
and were 3.65 times the levels in plasma. 
In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in rats, abnormal delivery and nursing conditions 
were observed at maternally toxic doses, and the number of stillbirths was increased in offspring. 
Behavioural and reproductive development of the offspring was not affected, but some parameters of 
physical development showed some delay, which is probably secondary to the pharmacology-based 
CNS effects of perampanel. The placental transfer was relatively low; 0.09% or less of administered 
dose was detected in the foetus. 
Nonclinical data reveal that perampanel was not genotoxic and had no carcinogenic potential. The 
administration of maximum tolerated doses to rats and monkeys resulted in pharmacologically-based 
CNS clinical signs and decreased terminal body weight. There were no changes directly attributable to 
perampanel in clinical pathology or histopathology.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fycompa is and what it is used for 
Fycompa contains a medicine called perampanel. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
anti epileptics. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy - where someone has repeated fits (seizures). 
It has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits that you have. 
Fycompa is used in association with other antiepileptic drugs to treat certain forms of epilepsy:  
In adults, adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 4 to 11 years) 
- 
- 
It is used to treat fits that affect one part of your brain (called a “partial seizure”). 
These partial seizures may or may not then be followed by a fit affecting all of your brain 
(called a “secondary generalisation”). 
In adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 7 to 11 years) 
- 
It is also used to treat certain fits that affect all of your brain from the start (called “generalised 
seizures”) and cause convulsions or staring spells. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Fycompa 
DO NOT TAKE Fycompa: 
- 
If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores 
after taking perampanel. 
If you are allergic to perampanel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fycompa if you have liver problems or moderate or 
severe kidney problems. 
You should not take Fycompa if you have serious liver problems or moderate or serious kidney 
problems. 
Before taking this medicine you should tell your doctor if you have a history of alcoholism or drug 
dependence. 
Cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking Fycompa in combination 
with other antiepileptic drugs. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. 
Fycompa may make you more likely to fall over, particularly if you are an older person; this 
might be due to your illness. 
Fycompa may make you aggressive, angry or violent. It may also cause you to have unusual or 
extreme changes in behaviour or mood, abnormal thinking and/or loss of touch with reality. 
If you or your family and/or friends notice any of these reactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing 
themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, contact your doctor straight away. 
Serious skin reactions including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and 
Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been reported with the use of perampanel. 
- 
DRESS typically, although not exclusively, appears as flu-like symptoms and a rash with a high 
body temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type 
of white blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. 
Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) can appear initially as reddish target- like spots or circular 
patches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and 
eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever 
and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-
threatening complications or be fatal. 
- 
If you experience any of the above after taking Fycompa (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
Children 
Fycompa is not recommended for children aged under 4. The safety and effectiveness are not yet 
known in children under 4 years of age for partial seizures and under 7 years of age in generalised 
seizures. 
- 
- 
Other medicines and Fycompa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Taking 
Fycompa with certain other medicines may cause side effects or affect how they work. Do not start or 
stop other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. 
- 
Other anti-epileptic medicines, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin that are 
used to treat fits may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken 
these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Felbamate (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) may also affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you 
are taking or have recently taken this medicine as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Midazolam (a medicine used to stop prolonged, acute (sudden) convulsive seizures, for sedation 
and sleep problem) may be affected by Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking midazolam 
as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Some other medicines such as rifampicin (a medicine used to treat bacterial infections), 
hypericum (St. John’s Wort) (a medicine used to treat mild anxiety) and ketoconazole (a 
medicine used to treat fungal infections) may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking 
or have recently taken these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
- 
Hormonal contraceptives (including oral contraceptives, implants, injections, and patches) 
Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make certain hormonal 
contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other forms of safe and effective 
contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You should continue doing this for 
one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may be appropriate contraception 
for you. 
- 
Fycompa with alcohol 
Speak to your doctor before drinking alcohol. Be careful about consuming alcohol with epilepsy 
medicines including Fycompa. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can make you less alert and affect your ability to drive 
or use tools or machines. 
Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can also make any feelings of anger, confusion or 
sadness worse. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not stop treatment without first discussing it 
with your doctor. 
- 
- 
Fycompa is not recommended in pregnancy. 
You must use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are 
being treated with Fycompa. You should continue doing this for one month after stopping 
treatment. Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make 
certain hormonal contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other 
forms of safe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You 
should also do this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may 
be appropriate contraception for you. 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Fycompa can pass into breast milk. 
The doctor will weigh up the benefit and risks to your baby of taking Fycompa while you are 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines until you know how Fycompa affects you. 
You must talk to your doctor about the effect of your epilepsy on driving and using machines. 
- 
Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. If this 
happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. 
Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa may make these effects worse. 
- 
Fycompa contains lactose 
Fycompa contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fycompa is and what it is used for 
Fycompa contains a medicine called perampanel. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
anti-epileptics. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy - where someone has repeated fits 
(seizures). It has been given to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits that you have. 
Fycompa is used in association with other antiepileptic drugs to treat certain forms of epilepsy:  
In adults, adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 4 to 11 years) 
- 
- 
It is used to treat fits that affect one part of your brain (called a “partial seizure”). 
These partial seizures may or may not then be followed by a fit affecting all of your brain 
(called a “secondary generalisation”). 
In adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 7 to 11 years) 
- 
It is also used to treat certain fits that affect all of your brain from the start (called “generalised 
seizures”) and cause convulsions or staring spells. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Fycompa 
DO NOT TAKE Fycompa: 
- 
If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores 
after taking perampanel. 
If you are allergic to perampanel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fycompa if you have liver problems or moderate or 
severe kidney problems. 
You should not take Fycompa if you have serious liver problems or moderate or serious kidney 
problems. 
Before taking this medicine you should tell your doctor if you have a history of alcoholism or drug 
dependence. 
Cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking Fycompa in combination 
with other antiepileptic drugs. 
79

- 
Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. 
Fycompa may make you more likely to fall over, particularly if you are an older person; this 
might be due to your illness. 
Fycompa may make you aggressive, angry or violent. It may also cause you to have unusual or 
extreme changes in behaviour or mood, abnormal thinking and/or loss of touch with reality. 
If you or your family and/or friends notice any of these reactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing 
themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, contact your doctor straight away. 
Serious skin reactions including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and 
Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been reported with the use of perampanel. 
- 
DRESS typically, although not exclusively, appears as flu-like symptoms and a rash with a high 
body temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type 
of white blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. 
Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) can appear initially as reddish target- like spots or circular 
patches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and 
eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever 
and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life- 
threatening complications or be fatal. 
- 
If you experience any of the above after taking Fycompa (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
Children 
Fycompa is not recommended for children aged under 4. The safety and effectiveness are not yet 
known in children under 4 years of age for partial seizures and under 7 years of age in generalised 
seizures.  
Other medicines and Fycompa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Taking 
Fycompa with certain other medicines may cause side effects or affect how they work. Do not start or 
stop other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. 
- 
Other anti-epileptic medicines, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin that are 
used to treat fits may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken 
these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Felbamate (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) may also affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you 
are taking or have recently taken this medicine as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Midazolam (a medicine used to stop prolonged, acute (sudden) convulsive seizures, for sedation 
and sleep problem) may be affected by Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking midazolam 
as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Some other medicines such as rifampicin (a medicine used to treat bacterial infections), 
hypericum (St. John’s Wort) (a medicine used to treat mild anxiety) and ketoconazole (a 
medicine used to treat fungal infections) may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking 
or have recently taken these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
Hormonal contraceptives (including oral contraceptives, implants, injections, and patches) 
Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make certain 
hormonal contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other forms of 
safe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You should 
continue doing this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may 
be appropriate contraception for you.

Fycompa with alcohol 
Speak to your doctor before drinking alcohol. Be careful about consuming alcohol with epilepsy 
medicines including Fycompa. 
- 
Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can make you less alert and affect your ability to drive 
or use tools or machines. 
Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can also make any feelings of anger, confusion or 
sadness worse. 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not stop treatment without first discussing it 
with your doctor. 
- 
- 
Fycompa is not recommended in pregnancy. 
You must use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are 
being treated with Fycompa. You should continue doing this for one month after stopping 
treatment. Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make 
certain hormonal contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other 
forms of safe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You 
should also do this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may 
be appropriate contraception for you. 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Fycompa can pass into breast milk. 
The doctor will weigh up the benefit and risks to your baby of taking Fycompa while you are 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines until you know how Fycompa affects you. 
You must talk to your doctor about the effect of your epilepsy on driving and using machines. 
- 
Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. If this 
happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. 
Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa may make these effects worse. 
- 
Fycompa contains 175 mg sorbitol (E420) in each mL 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you (or your child) have an intolerance 
to some sugars or if you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic 
disorder in which a person cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you (or your child) 
take or receive this medicine. 
Taking Fycompa with other anti-epileptic medicine, which contains sorbitol, may affect how much 
they work. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other anti-epileptic medicine(s) with 
sorbitol. 
Fycompa contains <0.005 mg benzoic acid (E210) and 1.1 mg sodium benzoate (E211) in each 
mL. 
Benzoic acid and sodium benzoate may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn 
babies (up to 4 weeks old).

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS 
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for perampanel, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of the 18 cases of psychotic disorders from clinical trials including 10 cases with positive 
dechallenge, the literature (2 case reports), spontaneous reports including in 10 cases a close temporal 
relationship, a positive dechallenge in 6 cases and rechallenge in 1 case, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between perampanel and psychotic disorder is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing perampanel should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for perampanel the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing perampanel is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pfizer Limited submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 4 March 2015 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested

Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data  
Update of sections 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the posology with once-weekly 
prophylaxis regimen. The RMP is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
The variation proposes amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The MAH recently completed two studies (3090A1-400-WW and B1821010) of BeneFIX which evaluated 
the  relative  safety  and  efficacy  of  2  prophylaxis  regimens  versus  on-demand  treatment  and  of  one 
prophylaxis regimen versus on-demand treatment, respectively. Data from these studies are provided 
with  the  present  variation  application  to  support  amending  section  4.2,  Posology  and  method  of 
administration and section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC)  to  add  the  100  IU/kg  once-weekly  prophylaxis  regimen.  Proposed  changes  to  Section  5.2 
Pharmacokinetic  properties  are  based  on  additional  PK  data  for  reformulated  BeneFIX  from  Study 
3090A1-304-WW (B1821038).  
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH recently completed two studies for BeneFIX evaluating the relative safety and efficacy of 
prophylaxis regimens versus on-demand treatment. Study 400 was previously submitted within a Type II 
variation on 02 September 2011 in support of a proposed addition for a once-weekly regimen for 
prophylaxis to SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1. However, a major objection remained unsolved and the 
variation was withdrawn by the MAH. The results of study 1010 were previously submitted in accordance 
with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (P46 144). 
The possibility to reduce the frequency of infusions in long term prophylaxis from twice-weekly to once 
weekly would be a relevant improvement for haemophilia patients. Currently there are multiple attempts 
to increase the half-life of different coagulation factor concentrates to enable such a dosing regimen.  
No new safety concerns have been detected from the submitted study results apart from potentially 
insufficient protection from bleedings. It is therefore considered to be a pragmatic approach to inform 
physicians treating haemophilia about once weekly regimen acknowledging that this schedule cannot be 
recommended in general, however it could be an option for some of the patients. Therefore updated 
sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are considered approvable. 
It has to be noted however that submitted data have not addressed convincingly the question, whether it 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 4/61 
 
  
  
 
is possible to maintain FIX:C levels in subjects with severe haemophilia B who represent the target 
population for long term prophylaxis within a range which protects them from bleedings during the entire 
dosing interval of seven days (168 hours) with doubled dose but the same half-life of 18 hours. 
Deficiencies have been identified in relation to the choice of study population, the duration of treatment 
and statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetic characterisation in the provided studies was limited: no 
PK-calculation based on in-patient FIX-activity levels according to the Clinical Guideline has been 
submitted and neither of the studies determined Benefix half-life. With an anticipated half-life of 18 hours 
(results of earlier studies) reported for BeneFIX it has to be assumed that FIX levels would return to 
pre-infusion levels after 72 hours.  
Therefore an update of the SmPC section 4.2. Posology and method of administration: ‘In other clinical 
studies BeneFIX was administered as 100 IU/kg once weekly, which may be an option for some patients 
(see section 5.1).’ is considered not approvable. 
The benefit-risk balance of BeneFIX remains positive. 
Scientific discussion for the EPAR 
In this variation the MAH updated the Product Information with data from two open-label studies in which 
BeneFIX was found to be safely administered at 100 IU/kg once-weekly. However, the half-life of the 
product and the limited pharmacokinetic study data for the once-weekly regimen do not allow 
recommending this regimen in general for long-term prophylaxis in severe haemophilia B patients. 
3.  Recommendations

throughout the PI. 
 is recommended for approval. 
The requested variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
BeneFIX (nonacog alfa, rFIX) is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic that has structural and 
functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX. Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a 
glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cell line. Marketing authorization in the EU was first granted under exceptional 
circumstances in 1997. In May 2010 the Commission decided, that there were no remaining grounds for 
the marketing authorization to remain under exceptional circumstances. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 5/61 
 
  
  
 
BeneFIX is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B 
(congenital factor IX deficiency). Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation 
characterized by decreased levels of factor IX and may result in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles, or 
internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. Replacement of 
factor IX allows for temporary correction of the factor deficiency and the attendant bleeding tendencies. 
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on 
the location and extent of the bleeding episode, on age and clinical condition of the patient and on factor 
IX recovery. In general, the required dosage in International Units (IU) is calculated using a formula that 
takes into account patient body weight, the desired percentage increase in circulating factor IX, and the 
average observed recovery. Estimation of the required dosage of rFIX can be based on the empirical 
finding that 1 IU factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity, on an average, by 0.8 
IU/dl. However, pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be 
adjusted accordingly. 
BeneFIX is available in five dosage strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 1,000 IU, 2,000 IU and 3000 IU per vial); 
the powder is to be reconstituted with 5 ml sodium chloride solution for injection. It is a single-use product 
for intravenous administration. For long-term prophylaxis in severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX is usually 
administered every 3 to 4 days.  
Two clinical studies were submitted by the MAH (see Table 1) to support once-weekly prophylaxis with 
100 IU/kg BeneFIX. These two studies (3090A1-400-WW, hereafter referred to as study 400, and 
B1821010, hereafter referred to as study 1010) of BeneFIX evaluated the relative safety and efficacy of 
2 prophylaxis regimens versus on-demand treatment and of one prophylaxis regimen versus on-demand 
treatment, respectively. Data from these studies are provided with the present variation application to 
support amending section 4.2, Posology and method of administration, section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic 
properties and section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties, of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
to add the 100 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis regimen. 
Proposed changes to Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties are based on relevant additional PK data for 
reformulated BeneFIX from Study 3090A1-304-WW (B1821038).  These data replace earlier PK data from 
the previous formulation included in that section. 
Study 3090A1-400-WW was previously submitted in a Type II variation in 02 September 2011 in support 
of a proposed addition for a once-weekly regimen for prophylaxis to SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1. This 
application was withdrawn, as the duration of treatment in Study 400 alone (4 months) did not meet the 
Clinical Guideline for FIX requirements (ie, 6 months).

4.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Study B1821010 
Factor IX activity was determined at the local laboratory for plasma samples collected at Visit 1 and at the 
central laboratory for pre- and post-dose sample taken on Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 26 (Visit 4), and Week 78 
(Visit 8), . 
FIX:C measured 30 minutes after administration of 100 IU/kg BeneFIX was approximately twice that 
observed after administration of 50 IU/kg.  
Their mean ± standard deviation (SD) recovery values are shown in Table 4.

The mean FIX recovery for pediatric subjects (N=5) was 0.64 ± 0.08 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) at Visit 2, 0.74 ± 
0.17 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) at Visit 4, and 0.72 ± 0.09 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) at Visit 8. 
Study 3090A1-400-WW 
A modified FIX recovery study was performed once at the start of each prophylaxis period (study week 16 
[visit 4] and study week 40 [visit 7]). After a minimum of 72 hours since the previous BeneFIX dose 
administration blood samples for determination of FIX:C were collected immediately before BeneFIX 
infusion and, when assessing recovery, at 30 minutes (±5 minutes) after the start of this infusion.  
Blood samples for determination of FIX:C were also collected once during each prophylaxis period, at 
study week 24 (visit 5) and study week 48 (visit 8) at least 72 hours after the previous dose 
administration in order to assess the trough FIX:C. For both FIX recovery and trough measurements, 
FIX:C was assessed at the local laboratory using the one-stage clotting assay. 
In this study, incremental recovery observed after administration of doses of 50 IU/kg or 100 IU/kg were 
consistent with what has been reported previously for the pharmacokinetics of factor IX. Following 50 
IU/kg and 100 IU/kg regimens, the mean ± SD recovery measured were consistent between dosing 
regimens: 0.93 ± 0.31 and 0.91 ± 0.35 IU/dL/IU/kg respectively. As expected, the mean ± SD 
concentration measured 0.5 hours after dosing increased in a dose proportional manner and were 49.9 ± 
16.1 and 91.5 ± 28.9 IU/dL for the respectively. 
The summary statistics are shown in Table 5 below. One subject (011-001101) was observed to have low 
C0.5hr with correspondingly low recovery on both occasions. The reason for this is unknown; it is possible 
that there was a problem with dose administration, sample collection, and/or the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies to BeneFIX. However, despite the low recovery, the subject did respond to treatment. 
Response to treatment (ie, primary efficacy endpoint) was evaluated in Study 400 by comparison of the 
ABR during weekly prophylaxis treatment with BeneFIX 50 IU/kg twice weekly and 100 IU/kg weekly. 
Assessor’s comment 
The MAH provided the requested details on the study participant. Clinically, a treatment effect was 
measurable. The low recovery values cannot be explained.

Table 5 
FIX:C and Recovery during Prophylactic BeneFIX Dosing in Subjects 
with Haemophilia B 
Assessor’s comment 
Pre-infusion plasma levels of FIX (C0h) and their increase at 30 minutes after start of BeneFIX infusion 
(C0.5h) have been measured once at the start of each prophylaxis period for determination of recovery. 
Although at least 72 hours had passed since the previous FIX administration during the preceding 
on-demand treatment period, the pre-infusion FIX:C was in most subjects higher than awaited for a 
population with the inclusion criterion of moderate-severe and severe haemophilia B. This is a concern 
regarding the assessment of efficacy, see there.  
FIX concentrations increased dose-proportionally when doubling the single dose from 50 IU/kg to 100 
IU/kg; incremental recovery remained unchanged. Half-life was not determined, but anticipated as being 
approximately 18 hours (see CSR section 6.2). 
Subjects Excluded From Pharmacokinetic Evaluation 
A total of 250 FIX:C values were reported in 47 individuals. Although all individual FIX:C values that were 
reported are presented, recovery could not be determined if either the C0h or the C0.5h was not reported. 
Recovery was not assessed for subjects 015-001501 (100 IU/kg), 016-001602 (50 IU/kg), 018-001802 
(100 IU/kg), 018-001803 (50 IU/kg), 018-001808 (100 IU/kg), 019-001906 (50 IU/kg), 020-002001 
(100 IU/kg), 025-002502 (100 IU/kg), 027-002701 (50 IU/kg), 028-002802 (50 IU/kg), 029-002901 (50 
IU/kg), and 032-003203 (50 IU/kg) (see Supportive Tables 15.53 and 15.54). 
Trough Concentration Results 
Trough FIX:C data are shown in CSR Supportive Tables 15.53 and 15.54, as well as in Table 2. No 
difference could be detected between the mean Ctrough observed for the same doses. Despite the longer 
time between doses, which would predict lower Ctrough following 100 IU/kg once per week, the observed 
Ctrough values were similar between doses. This may reflect the fact that the time of sample collection 
could be any time after at least 72 hours post dose, and sample collection was not at the same time as the 
true lowest concentration.

Assessor’s comment 
Long term replacement therapy is intended to provide FIX concentrations which are sufficiently high to 
protect from bleedings, also at their lowest values. In this study trough FIX:C was measured once during 
each prophylaxis regimen. As written in CSR section 11.5 ‘Pharmacokinetic conclusions’:”.. the time of 
blood sampling for trough level measurement could be any time after at least 72 hours post dose, and 
sample collection was not at the same time as the true lowest concentration”. So in fact, the reported 
values are no “trough”, meaning lowest values immediately before next dosing. 
Figure 1 below is a revision of the FIX:C simulation from the previous variation, using the observed mean 
C0.5hr for the respective doses and assuming a 1-compartment elimination model with a half-life of 18 
hours. In this simulation, the C0.5hr values are in agreement with the observed concentrations, but the 
concentrations at the end of the dosing interval are very low, due to the assumption of a monoexponential 
model. It does, however, reasonably predict the concentrations observed at least 72 hours after dosing, 
when the "trough" concentrations were to be collected.

Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH revised the simulation of factor IX concentrations as requested. The revised Figure 1 above 
shows a simulated predicted trough level for 100 IU/kg given every 7 days of 0.14 IU/dL and of 1.40 IU/dL 
for the regular 50 IU/kg twice weekly regimen. As demonstrated in the simulation, the proposed 100 
IU/kg once weekly regimen is not able to maintain a protective factor IX level throughout the dosing 
interval. During the last 2 to 3 days of the treatment interval, patients’ factor IX levels are as low as if they 
were without substitution therapy. This corresponds to the clinical finding that bleedings occurred more 
often in the late phase of the treatment interval: 12/52 bleeds during 0-72 hrs and 40/52 bleeds during 
72-168 hours after administration of 100 IU/kg (Table 5 of AR). The once weekly posology seems 
inadequate. 
Anti-CHO Antibodies 
The incidence of anti-CHO antibodies was similar to what was observed in the survey of samples from 
normal healthy volunteers during the validation of the assay. Testing for anti-CHO antibodies was 
performed in 50 subjects on a total of 99 occasions. Twenty-one subjects (42%) tested positive on at 
least 1 occasion. While most subjects who tested positive did so on both occasions studied, 3 subjects 
tested positive at week 0 and were negative at week 56 and one subject tested negative at week 0 and 
positive at week 56. 
Assessor’s comment 
CSR Listing 15.52 of Anti-CHO Lab results demonstrates, that the testing on anti-CHO antibodies revealed 
in most cases similar results for the titers measured at screening and in week 56 of treatment, either both 
negative or both positive. So no concern derives from that. 
Study B1821010+ Study 3090A1-400-WW 
Residual FIX:C Observed 
Early studies of FIX:C half-life of 18 hours led to guidelines for designing of PK studies limiting sampling 
to 50 to 72 hours after dose administration. During studies of extended half-life factor IX replacement 
products, PK samples were collected up to 96 hours after dosing and a longer estimate for FIX:C half-life 
(33 hours) after BeneFIX administration emerged (3). Assuming a peak FIX:C of 80 IU/dL after a dose of 
100 IU/kg, the residual FIX:C after 5 half-lives (~ 1 week, 168 hours), would be expected to be 
approximately 2.5 IU/dL; assuming linearity of PK, the residual FIX:C after a 50 IU/kg dose would be 
approximately 1.25 IU/dL. 
Assessor’s comment 
A subgroup of 22 participants in the study of Powell et al, mentioned above, completed a baseline 
pharmacokinetic assessment. It is important to point out that the terminal half-life was 33.8 hours and 
the half-life, calculated on the basis of the traditional 48-hour pharmacokinetic sampling schedule, was 
17.04 hours (95% CI, 15.89 to 18.26), which is similar to previously reported 48-hour-data. The time to 
reach a factor IX level of 1 IU/dL (1%) was 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.6 to 5.7). 
These data do not support an addition of a once-weekly 100 IU/kg prophylaxis regimen.

EMA/CHMP/686005/2015

Neither Study 1010 nor 400 were designed to collect data to allow an assessment of FIX activity half-life 
after administration of BeneFIX. All subjects in these studies had recovery assessed on at least 3 
occasions following at least a 72-hour washout since previous doses of factor IX replacement. These data 
were used in a post hoc analysis of residual FIX:C observed a week after dosing. All subjects enrolled in 
Studies 400 and 1010 had moderately severe or severe haemophilia, so it would be anticipated that their 
FIX:C would be ≤ 2 IU/dL if sufficient time had passed since previous doses. Of particular interest are the 
FIX:C collected approximately one week (144 to 192 hours) after a previous dose (Appendix Table 1). Of 
these 47, 30 show FIX:C greater than 2 IU/dL (minimum [min] - maximum [max] of 2.13 – 11.4 IU/dL) 
and thus are consistent with the longer half-life described by Powell et al, which in turn would provide PK 
justification for the observed efficacy of once-weekly dosing. 
Assessor’s comment 
The pre-infusion FIX:C in study 400 was in most subjects higher than awaited for a population with the 
inclusion criterion of moderate-severe and severe haemophilia B. In study 1010 16 Patients had severe 
haemophilia B and 9 patients had moderate severe haemophilia B.  
But the data of all patients in both studies were used in the post hoc analysis. Therefore, the results are 
questioned with regard to once-weekly dosing in severe haemophilia B patients. 
Valid calculation of Factor IX activity half-life is considered to be crucial when intending extension of the 
dosage-interval. Lack of such reliable complete PK-data including previous dosage and pre-dose values 
considered to be a significant gap. Furthermore, reliable endogenous FIX-levels for each patient are 
required for assessment of PK- and efficacy-results. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The population PK model for FIX activity after BeneFIX administration was updated, from a previously 
developed model, using a pooled dataset from the first 8 studies and was evaluated with a pooled dataset 
from Study 1010 and Study 400.

The final model was a 2-compartment model, parameterised using clearance (CL), central volume of 
distribution (V1), peripheral volume of distribution (V2), intercompartmental clearance (Q), and effect of 
normalised weight as a power function on each parameter. Inter-occasional variability on CL and V1 
showed significant decreases in the objective function and, therefore, were included in the model.  A 
correlation between V2 and Q was also included. The effect of study on residual error was evaluated. 
Inclusion of separate parameters for Studies C9407-21/C9408-21 (θ11) and 3090A1-300-WW (θ12) and 
the all other studies (θ5 ) was found to be significant. Age was not found to be a significant covariate when 
weight was included in the model.

When datasets of identical design to Studies 1010 and 400 were simulated using the final parameter 
estimates from the model, actual observations from the studies were higher than the simulated values as 
may be seen in Figure 2, both immediately after dose administration (left figure) as well as up to a week 
after dosing (right figure). 
Figure 4  
Visual Predictive Checks (VPC) from the Final Model Immediately afterand 
Later after Dosing (Prediction and Variance Corrected: B1821002 (Study 400) 
and B1821010) 
The positive bias observed immediately after dosing, may reflect the difference in subjects included in the 
study. The mean recovery observed in Study 400 was higher than had been reported in other studies and, 
thus, the higher observed than model-predicted FIX activity shortly after dosing is consistent with this 
result. 
The bias observed during the 50 to 200 hour period after dosing may be a result of the longer half-life of 
FIX:C after BeneFIX administration (33 hours), which has come to light in studies of extended half-life 
products in which BeneFIX was a PK comparator (Powell et al). It was observed when the model was 
applied to the data collected in Studies 400 and 1010 because they uniquely collected samples 
approximately 1 week after previously administered doses. 
Assessor’s comment: 
As mentioned by the applicant neither study 400 nor study 1010 were designed to collect data to allow for 
a definitive assessment of the FIX activity half-life after administration of BeneFIX.  Instead of real 
measurements, the MAH provided a simulation of FIX:C over time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015

Thus, although there are observations that are in line with the idea of a half-life longer than claimed on 
data from early studies, a definite proof of a longer half-life of FIX activity after administration of BeneFIX 
is still open.  
Based on the observation of a possibly longer half-life one might critically reconsider the population PK 
model for FIX activity following BeneFIX administration. On one hand the ETA-shrinkages for V2 (30.8%) 
and Q (25.8%) from the final popPK model are relatively high [2.5.3.4, Table 2], indicating a lack of data 
to provide robust individual parameter estimates regarding V2 and Q. On the other hand, comparing the 
data on FIX activity in studies 400 and 1010 to the model simulated profiles, a bias (i.e. higher values 
than simulated based on the final popPK model which could be due to a longer half-life) is to be observed, 
questioning the validity of the model for data from these 2 studies. The applicant attributes this bias to 
possible study differences (i.e. differences in included subjects between studies 400 & 1010), but further 
investigations, taking study effects for studies 400 and 1010 respectively into account, were not 
performed. 
Furthermore, meaningful PK-data containing maximum- and trough-levels in the late phase of the 
treatment –interval (measured values in respective patients) are considered to be essential. The MAH 
should perform additional long-term PK investigations regarding the FIX activity following BeneFIX 
administration. 
In study 400 mean peak values of 49.9 IU/dL (after infusion of 50 IU/kg) and 91.5 IU/dL (after infusion 
of 100 IU/kg) were found. With an anticipated half-life of 18 hours reported for BeneFIX it is assumed that 
FIX levels return to pre-infusion levels after 72 hours.  
4.2.1.  Discussion 
FIX concentrations increased dose-proportionally when doubling the single dose from 50 IU/kg to 100 
IU/kg, incremental recovery remained unchanged between the two prophylactic regimens in study 400. 
Recovery values observed in Study 400 (0.91±0.35 IU/dL/IU/kg and 0.93±0.31 IU/dL/IU/kg for the 100 
IU/kg and 50 IU/kg doses respectively) were higher than the recovery observed in Study 1010 
(0.77±0.18 IU/dL/IU/kg). The MAH stated that Individual recovery values do vary and so the higher 
values observed in Study 400 may simply reflect random chance. 
In study 400, Pre-infusion plasma levels of FIX (C0h) and their increase at 30 minutes after start of 
BeneFIX infusion (C0.5h) have been measured once at the start of each prophylaxis period for 
determination of recovery. Although at least 72 hours had passed since the previous FIX administration 
during the preceding on-demand treatment period, the pre-infusion FIX:C was in most subjects higher 
than awaited for a population with the inclusion criterion of moderate-severe and severe haemophilia B. 
In study 1010 only 5 patients had severe haemophilia B and 20 patients had moderate severe 
haemophilia B. But recovery data of all patients in both studies were used in the post hoc analysis. 
Therefore, the results are questioned with regard to once-weekly dosing in severe haemophilia B 
patients. 
Half-life was not determined, neither in study 400 nor in study 1010, but anticipated as being 
approximately 18 hours (results of earlier studies of BeneFIX). The MAH refers to a study of Powell et al, 
which published a FIX:C half-life of 33 hours after BeneFIX administration. A subgroup of 22 participants 
in this study completed a baseline pharmacokinetic assessment. It is important to point out that the 
terminal half-life was 33.8 hours and the half-life, calculated on the basis of the traditional 48-hour 
pharmacokinetic sampling schedule, was 17.04 hours (95% CI, 15.89 to 18.26), which is similar to 
previously reported 48-hour-data. The time to reach a factor IX level of 1 IU/dL (1%) was 5.1 days (95% 
CI, 4.6 to 5.7). Therefore, these data do not support an addition of a once-weekly 100 IU/kg prophylaxis

regimen. In study 400 mean peak values of 49.9 IU/dL (after infusion of 50 IU/kg) and 91.5 IU/dL (after 
infusion of 100 IU/kg) were found. With an anticipated half-life of 18 hours reported for BeneFIX it is 
assumed that FIX levels return to pre-infusion levels after 72 hours. 
No PK-calculation based upon in-patient FIX-activity levels according to the Clinical Guideline has been 
submitted. Instead the MAH provided a simulation of FIX:C over time. 
Thus, although there are observations that are in line with the idea of a half-life longer than claimed on 
data from early studies, a definite proof of a longer half-life of FIX activity after administration of BeneFIX 
is still open.  
Based on the observation of a possibly longer half-life one might critically reconsider the population PK 
model for FIX activity following BeneFIX administration. On one hand, the ETA-shrinkages for V2 (30.8%) 
and Q (25.8%) from the final popPK model are relatively high [2.5.3.4, Table 2], indicating a lack of data 
to provide robust individual parameter estimates regarding V2 and Q. On the other hand, comparing the 
data on FIX activity in studies 400 and 1010 to the model simulated profiles, a bias (i.e. higher values 
than simulated based on the final popPK model which could be due to a longer half-life) is to be observed, 
questioning the validity of the model for data from these 2 studies. The applicant attributes this bias to 
possible study differences (i.e. differences in included subjects between studies 400 & 1010), but further 
investigations, taking study effects for studies 400 and 1010 respectively into account, were not 
performed. 
Furthermore, meaningful PK-data containing maximum- and trough-levels in the late phase of the

should perform additional long-term PK investigations regarding the FIX activity following BeneFIX 
administration. 
4.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
4.3.1.  Methods 
Study B1821010  
‘A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Compare On-Demand Treatment to a Prophylaxis 
Regimen of Nonacog-Alfa (BeneFIX) in Subjects with Moderately Severe to Severe 
Haemophilia B (FIX:C≤2%)’  
The phase III study was performed between September 2011 and April 2014 in 15 centers from 9 
countries world-wide. 
Objective(s): 
Primary objective: to demonstrate that a prophylaxis regimen of BeneFIX reduces the ABR compared to 
on-demand treatment only, in subjects with moderately severe to severe haemophilia B. 
The secondary objective:  to describe the safety and efficacy of BeneFIX when administered for 
prophylaxis at a dose of 100 IU/kg once weekly. 
Assessor’s comment: 
In general, the primary objective of comparing annual bleed rates (ABR) under on-demand versus 
prophylaxis-regimen is questioned: Clinical support for Extension of the dosing interval mainly requires 
proof of protection in the late phase of the treatment interval in severely affected haemophilia patients. 
ABR in an on-demand treatment setting mainly reflects bleeding-pattern of the respective population but 
does not serve as adequate comparator for a ”new” prophylaxis regimen. 
Assessment report

Study participants 
Subjects were eligible to participate in this study, if they had a documented history of moderately-severe 
or severe haemophilia B (FIX:C ≤2%), were males aged 12 to 65 years, with at least 100 exposure days 
to FIX products and had a minimum of 12 bleeding episodes, 6 of which were joint bleeds, in the 12 
months before screening. 
Treatment 
Period 1 On-Demand Treatment 
In the on-demand treatment period, bleeding events were treated at the discretion of the investigator 
using the study drug according to the locally approved BeneFIX label or the BeneFIX Core Data Sheet. The 
dose prescribed by the investigator was to be based on the subject’s body weight (as measured at the 
most recent study visit according to the study procedures) and nominal vial potency. On-demand 
treatment was defined as the administration of study drug at the time of an acute bleeding event. 
Period 2 Prophylaxis Regimen 
In the prophylaxis regimen period, subjects were to administer the prophylaxis dose once weekly. The 
interval between prophylaxis infusions was intended to be 7 days. The prophylaxis dose was to be 
approximately 100 IU/kg, rounded to the closest vial strength. The dose was to be prepared using the 
subject’s body weight (as measured at the most recent study visit according to the study procedures) and 
actual vial potency (prior to approval of Amendment 1, dated 28 September 2011) or nominal potency of 
the study drug (after approval of Amendment 1). 
Additional Treatment During Prophylaxis Regimen Period 
If a bleeding event occurred during the prophylaxis period, the subject was to infuse study drug on 
demand at a dosage determined by the investigator according to the locally approved BeneFIX label or 
the BeneFIX Core Data Sheet to treat the acute bleeding event. The subject was to return to the 
once-weekly regularly scheduled prophylaxis dosing regimen as soon as possible at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Concomitant treatment with FIX concentrates other than the study drug was prohibited during the 
treatment phase from Visit 2 (Enrollment) to Visit 8 (Study Completion), unless clinically indicated. 
Except for FIX concentrates, there were no other restrictions on the subject’s regular medication. 
Analgesics, as well as other therapy considered necessary for the subject’s well-being during the study 
were permissible at the discretion of the investigator.

Study 3090A1-400-WW  
‘A multicenter, open-label study to compare on-demand treatment with 2 prophylaxis 
regimens of recombinant coagulation factor IX (BeneFIX) reformulated drug product (rFIX-R) 
in subjects with severe haemophilia B’  
The phase IV study was performed between May 2007 and October 2010 in 18 centers in Canada, USA, 
Europe and Russian Federation. 
Objective(s): 
Primary objective: to evaluate efficacy and safety of BeneFIX infused as two prophylaxis regimens (100 
IU/kg once weekly and 50 IU/kg twice weekly) compared with BeneFIX administered in an on-demand 
regimen only. 
Secondary objectives: to evaluate and compare efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes of 2 
BeneFIX prophylaxis regimens, as well as patient-reported outcomes between the prophylaxis regimens 
and the first on-demand regimen. 
Study participants 
Subjects were eligible to participate in this study, if they had a documented history of moderately-severe 
or severe haemophilia B (FIX:C ≤2%), were males aged 6 to 65 years, and had a minimum of 12 bleeding 
episodes, 6 of which were joint bleeds, in the 12 months before screening. 
Treatment 
The 50 IU/kg twice-weekly dosing regimen employed in Study 400-WW was selected based on the results 
of pivotal Study 3090A1-304-WW (reformulated BeneFIX), where subjects utilizing prophylaxis infused a 
median dose of 51.7 IU/kg (range 13.9 to 184.2 IU/kg), given as 2 or more infusions per week. This dose 
is also within the range and frequency (ie, 40-100 FIX units/kg two to three times weekly) recommended 
by the Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (MASAC) of the National Haemophilia Foundation 
(NHF)1, a United States-based advocacy organization. 
[1 Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee MASAC Recommendation Concerning Prophylaxis (Regular 
Administration of Clotting Factor Concentrate to Prevent Bleeding) (Document #179), 03 November 2007] 
Assessor’s comment 
Median dose of 52 IU/twice weekly is not in accordance with the EMA-approved SmPC (40 IU/kg at 3-4 
days intervals). 
The 100 IU/kg alternative, once-weekly prophylaxis regimen in Study 3090A1-400-WW was derived by 
doubling the twice-weekly dose, so that the same total factor IX dose in IU/kg is delivered over the same 
period, given, however, in 1 infusion rather than in 2 infusions.  
The dose for the prophylaxis regimen was either 50 IU/kg twice weekly or 100 IU/kg once weekly based 
on nominal vial potency. Subjects utilizing on-demand therapy were treated at a dose prescribed at the 
discretion of the investigator. If a bleeding episode occurred during the prophylaxis period, the subject 
was to infuse BeneFIX at a dosage determined by the investigator. The assigned prophylaxis regimen was 
then to be resumed as soon as possible, at the discretion of the investigator and subject. 
Subjects were given vials containing 250 IU and/or 2000 IU (nominally) of BeneFIX. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
At the screening visit, reasonable efforts were made to determine all relevant treatments (ie, 
pharmacologic and non-pharmacological treatments, including non-prescription medications) received by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015

the subject within 30 days before administration of the study drug. Use of prestudy medications (other 
than FIX concentrates) continued unchanged. Analgesic agents, as well as other therapy considered 
necessary for the subject’s well-being during the study, could have been given at the discretion of the 
investigator. During each prophylaxis period, subjects could treat any bleeding episode with BeneFIX, at 
the discretion of the investigator. Concomitant treatment with any FIX product other than BeneFIX was 
prohibited during this study. 
Assessor’s comment 
According to Clinical Study Report (CSR) Supportive Table 15.16 ‘Number (%) of subjects reporting prior 
non-study medications’ only 19 out of the 50 patients enrolled reported the use of blood coagulation 
factor IX within the 30 days before study treatment. It is questioned whether all patients enrolled had 
moderate – severe or severe haemophilia B.

Thirteen subjects (52.0%) experienced 64 spontaneous bleeds during the prophylaxis period. Three 
subjects experienced 1 spontaneous bleeding episode each within 48 hours of a previous prophylaxis 
infusion. The MAH stated that all of these bleeding episodes were associated with confounding factors and 
were not considered occurrences of LETE. 
4 subjects experienced 2-5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each within >48 - ≤72 hours of a previous 
prophylaxis infusion. 
The majority of spontaneous bleeds in the prophylaxis period (47 of 64 bleeds, 73.4%) occurred >72 
hours from the previous prophylaxis infusion.  
Assessor’s comment 
The prophylactic treatment regimen leads to statistically significant lower annualized bleed rates (ABR) 
compared to on-demand treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study has been met. 
7 out of 25 (28%) patients experienced multiple spontaneous bleeding episodes within 72 hours of a 
previous prophylaxis infusion. In addition, the presented data show, that a considerable number of 
subjects (12/25, 48%) experienced bleeds after 4 or 5 days despite being on the proposed once-weekly 
prophylaxis regimen and received additional on-demand treatment. 
Mean Infusion Dose and Total Factor IX Consumption 
There was a cumulative total of 1923 infusions for 25 subjects over the entire study; with a mean number 
of infusions (±SD) per subject of 50.0±2.0 (median: 50) for prophylaxis treatment, 26.0±18.0 (median: 
24) for on-demand treatment, and 2 ± 1 (median: 1) infusions for preventative treatment (N=6) (safety 
population). These infusion numbers do not include the infusions for the recovery studies which occurred 
at Visit 2 in the on-demand period and at Visits 4 and 8, the start and end of the prophylaxis period. A 
total of 73 infusions were administered for the recovery studies. 
The mean dose by weight per infusion was 99±2 IU/kg (median: 99 IU/kg, range: 93-104 IU/kg) for 
prophylaxis infusions and 40±9 IU/kg (median: 42 IU/kg, range: 20-54 IU/kg) for on-demand infusions. 
The majority of infusions administered in response to a bleeding episode were between the doses of 30 to 
50 IU/kg (527 out of 659 infusions, 80.0%), and of those, 453 infusions resulted in an “Excellent” or 
“Good” response to the infusion. 
The annualized mean TFC by weight per subject was 4985±233 IU/kg for prophylaxis infusions 
administered during the 12-month prophylaxis period and 707±519 IU/kg for on-demand infusions 
administered during the entire 18 months of the study. During the same timeframes, the monthly TFC by 
weight per subject was 415±19 IU/kg for prophylaxis infusions and 59 ± 43 IU/kg for on-demand 
infusions. 
For the recovery studies, the annualized mean TFC by weight per subject was 152±27 IU/kg.  
Incidence of Less-Than-Expected Therapeutic Effect (LETE) 
Two successive “No Response” ratings after BeneFIX infusions did not occur in any subject in the 
on-demand setting. Therefore out of 507 bleeding episodes (safety population), no bleeds met LETE 
criteria in the on-demand setting and the observed incidence rate of LETE in the on-demand setting was 
0.0%. 
In the prophylaxis setting, 3 subjects were identified as having spontaneous bleeding episodes within 48 
hours after a regularly scheduled prophylaxis dose of BeneFIX. Confounding factors included the bleed 
being in a target joint identified at the start of the study (Subjects 10171004 and 10521002) and 
inadequate dose and deviation in prescribed prophylaxis regimen before the bleed (Subject 10221002). 
These circumstances discount these bleeding episodes as occurrences of LETE. Out of a total of 1254 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 24/61 
 
  
  
routine prophylaxis infusions, no bleeding episodes met the criteria for LETE in the prophylaxis setting 
and the observed incidence rate of LETE was 0.00%. 
No occurrences of LETE were reported following infusion of BeneFIX for the FIX recovery studies. 
Study 3090A1-400-WW  
Primary Efficacy Results 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the annualized bleed rate (ABR); Table 11 describes the 
data for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population in the study. 
Routine dosing statistically significantly reduced ABR when compared with on-demand therapy. Both 
traumatic and spontaneous bleed rates were lower after routine dosing compared to the on-demand 
periods. 
Table 11  
BeneFIX Study 400-WW - Comparison of Annualized Bleed Rates between 
First On-demand and Each Prophylaxis Regimen and between Prophylaxis 
Regimens - ITT Population 
Assessor’s comment 
Both prophylactic treatment regimens lead to statistically significant lower annualized bleed rates (ABR) 
compared to on-demand treatment. There is no statistically significant difference in ABR between the 50 
IU/kg twice weekly and the 100 IU/kg once weekly prophylactic schedule. The applicant concludes that 
the primary efficacy endpoint of the study has been met. 
However, there is a concern regarding the selection of study population. The ABR of 35.1 bleeds per year 
during the initial on-demand phase represents a population of 2-3 bleeds per month. However, only 19 
out of 50 subjects used factor IX concentrates within the 30 days prior to study treatment. Such numbers 
are considered to be conflicting. It is not clear, whether the remaining 31 subjects did not have any bleeds 
during the 30 days prior to study treatment or whether they had bleeds but no access to factor IX 
products.  
Further doubts on the severity of haemophilia B in the study population arise from factor IX 
determinations. Supportive Tables 15.53 and 15.54 ‘Individual FIX:C observed during 50 IU/kg twice 
weekly’ and ‘…during 100 IU/kg once weekly’, respectively, provide the results of the recovery testing 
(C0h, C0.5h, total dose, weight, in vivo recovery, and Ctrough). It is noted, that baseline FIX:C (C0h) was in 
the majority of subjects >2%. The assessor prepared the following summarizing table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 25/61 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4  
Individual FIX:C (C0h) observed at start of prophylaxis periods 
According to this table, only 15 out of 40 subjects ready to receive 50 IU/kg (37.5%) and 16 out of 42 
subjects awaiting 100 IU/kg (38.1%) had a FIX activity ≤2%, which defines moderate-severe and severe 
haemophilia B and was an inclusion criterion. More than 60% of the subjects were at the start of their 
prophylactic treatment periods in a situation of moderate or mild haemophilia B. It is current knowledge, 
that individuals with moderate haemophilia B seldom have spontaneous bleeding and subjects with mild 
haemophilia B (FIX:C >5%-30%) normally do not have spontaneous bleeding episodes, at all. The 
concern is, whether efficacy of the proposed prophylactic regimen has been investigated in the 
appropriate study population for which long-term prophylaxis is indicated i.e. with severe haemophilia B. 
The MAH is requested to comment.  
As already requested above, baseline FIX activity levels before start of the first on-demand treatment 
period would be of major interest. The MAH is asked whether the inclusion criterion ‘history of 
moderate-severe or severe haemophilia B’ was verified by measuring a FIX:C ≤2% at screening and to 
provide that data.  
Table 12 
Summary of Time from Start of Previous Test Article Infusion to Start of New  
Bleed during Prophylaxis Treatment – ITT Population 
Assessor’s comment 
Table 12 presents the number of bleedings after dosing and with respect to the prophylaxis-regimen. It 
can be concluded that the occurrence of bleedings is related to the actual FIX plasma level. However, 
superiority of one regimen cannot be derived from this presentation due to the different dosage. 
The majority of bleeds within 72 hours after dosing occurred in the 50 IU/kg group, i.e. 29 bleeds versus 
12 bleeds within 72 hrs after 100 IU/kg. Due to the different dosing intervals of the prophylactic 
regimens, later occurring bleedings cannot be compared.

Secondary Efficacy Results: Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Data on pain, sleep, and days lost from work/school were recorded in the diary at 24 and 48 hours after 
the onset of each joint bleeding episode. Additional data on health status were collected at the end of the 
16-week on-demand period, and at the end of each prophylaxis period using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) 
Health Survey. 
Sleep Diary 
The amount and quality of sleep was measured by a sleep diary, which was completed by the subjects at 
24 and 48 hours after each incidence of hemarthrosis. The question in the sleep diary for each of those 
time points referred to the amount and quality of their sleep “last night.” Thus, the data for 24 hours 
refers to sleep within the 24-hour period after the bleeding episode (first night) and the data for 48 hours 
refers to sleep within the second 24-hour period after the bleeding episode (second night). 
The analyses were done for all bleeding episodes for which a completed sleep diary was available (rather 
than per subject), for each of the treatment regimens: during the first on demand regimen, during 
treatment with 100 IU/kg once weekly, during treatment with 50 IU/kg twice weekly, or during the 
second on-demand regimen. For each treatment regimen, the mean of all the mean differences (ie, the 
sleep diary scores for the second night minus those for the first night after the bleeding episode) are 
presented, along with the standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values based on those 
mean differences. The row for mean contains the same data as for mean differences. Note that the total 
number of bleeding episodes for Table 9-4 was 837, rather than 831 used for Table 9-6, because the latter 
table did not include bleeds ≥7 days after infusion and only included 1 bleed per day. 
Overall, there were no meaningful differences in sleep variables across treatment regimens. There was a 
statistically significant increase (from 7.4 to 7.8 hours) in the amount of time slept and a statistically 
significant decrease (0.4) in the number of sleep interruptions, from the first night to the second night 
after the bleed event for each treatment regimen, except for the second on-demand period. Self-reported 
sleep quality decreased by 0.3 points (on a 1 to 5 scale) from the first to second night after the bleed 
event. 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
Subjects were required to complete the BPI following a joint bleed. At 24 hours post-bleed 27.2% of 
subjects reported pain. None of the parameters captured by the BPI appeared to differ meaningfully 
across treatment regimens. 
Health-Related Productivity 
The amount of work missed did not appear to differ meaningfully across regimens at either time point (24 
or 48 hours) for any category of work performed. Subjects reported a meaningful subjective impact on 
their work (on average, a 20%-25% degree of impairment) at 24 hours. 
SF-36 Questionnaire (Health Survey Short Form-36 questionnaire) 
Using the norm-based scoring for the SF-36, a score of 50 represents the mean for the US population, 
with a standard deviation of 10 points. The role-physical and pain domains showed statistically and 
clinically significant improvements in both prophylaxis regimens relative to the on-demand regimen. The 
scores at the end of the 50 IU/kg period also showed statistically significant improvements compared with 
the on-demand period in the vitality scores and role-emotional domains, although the magnitude of the 
change in vitality may not be clinically meaningful. None of the other domains showed statistically 
significant change.

Other Efficacy Parameters 
Number of Infusions for Resolution of Bleeds by Location 
Across all locations, 78.0% (648 of 831 bleeds) resolved with a single infusion of BeneFIX. Most joint 
(77.7%) and soft tissue/muscle bleeds (81.4%) resolved with 1 BeneFIX infusion. Similarly, the majority 
of multiple site bleeds were also treated with a single BeneFIX infusion (80.0%). Five (5) joint bleeds 
required >4 infusions of BeneFIX for resolution. 
Time between Bleed Onset and Prior Prophylaxis Infusion 
The majority of spontaneous bleeds (33 of 62 bleeds; 53.2%) occurred >72 hours from the prior 
prophylaxis infusion, which includes both treatment periods (50 IU/kg twice weekly and 100 IU/kg once 
weekly). In the 100 IU/kg treatment period, of the 52 observed bleeds (including spontaneous and 
traumatic bleeds), 12 occurred in the first 72 hours after a prophylaxis dose. In the 50 IU/kg treatment 
period, of the 35 observed bleeds (including spontaneous and traumatic bleeds), 29 occurred in the first 
72 hours after a prophylaxis dose. 
Consumption of BeneFIX 
The median numbers of exposure days per subject (with corresponding minimum and maximum values) 
were 16.0 (1.0 to 38.0 days, 100 IU/kg once weekly) and 28.5 (1.0 to 44.0 days, 50 IU/kg twice weekly). 
The median cumulative doses were 104,030 IUs per subject for the 100 IU/kg group (2500 to 231,280 IU) 
and 105,042 IUs per subject for the 50 IU/kg group (3500 to 216,340). 
Study B1821010 and Study 3090A1-400-WW 
ABRs pooled by regimen for Study 1010 and Study 400 for prophylaxis with BeneFIX are presented in 
Table 13. For the pooled data, once-weekly prophylaxis using 100 IU/kg BeneFIX (mean ±SD: 4.1 ±8.4) 
provided efficacy, in terms of ABR, comparable to twiceweekly prophylaxis at 50 IU/kg (mean ±SD: 2.8 
±5.7). Likewise, the pooled prophylaxis ABR data for Study 1010 and Study 400 by regimen, type of 
bleed (aetiology) and location of bleed (site type), provided comparable efficacy for 50 IU/kg 
twice-weekly and 100 IU/kg once-weekly.

Mixed Model in Efficacy Population 
The pairwise comparison of regimens from the Poisson model gave similar results as the paired t-test 
which is that the prophylaxis regimen had statistically significantly lower ABR than the on-demand 
regimen. 
The results from the Poisson regression model analysis, as well as the previously reported ANOVA results 
for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population in BeneFIX Study 400 are shown in Table 15. 
Table 15

which is that both the prophylaxis regimens had statistically significantly lower ABR than the first 
on-demand regimen, and the ABR of the prophylaxis regimens were not significantly different from each 
other. 
Treatment Failure Post Hoc Analysis 
A post hoc survival curve analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier technique comparing 100 IU/kg 
once-weekly and 50 IU/kg twice-weekly. Prophylaxis data (ie, individual data for spontaneous bleeds 
from the prophylaxis periods) for the two regimens were pooled from Study 400 and Study 1010, and 
failure for this analysis was defined as having two spontaneous joint bleeds during the prophylaxis 
regimen. If a second spontaneous joint bleed for a subject occurred during the regimen treatment period, 
the date of this bleed was used; otherwise, the subject was considered censored on the date of the end 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 29/61 
 
  
  
 
 
of that regimen treatment period. Each prophylaxis period in Study 400 was approximately 4 months in 
duration, and approximately 12 months for the 100 IU/kg once-weekly period in Study 1010. Days were 
counted from the first prophylactic dose of the regimen until either the failure date or censoring date. 
Subjects from Study 400 with data for both prophylaxis regimens were included in both the 100 IU/kg 
once-weekly and 50 IU/kg twice-weekly regimen treatment periods. 
The probability of failure by Day 60b and by Day 120 is reported for each regimen, and the null hypothesis 
of equal survivor functions for the two regimens was tested using the Chi-square (log-rank) test statistic. 
Forty-three (43) of the 47 subjects randomised in Study 400 contributed data for the 50 IU/kg 
twice-weekly regimen. Data from 44 of the 47 subjects randomised in Study 400 and all 25 subjects from 
Study 1010 were pooled for a total of 69 subjects for the 100 IU/kg onceweekly regimen. 
The probability of failure (ie, having 2 spontaneous joint bleeds) by Day 60 is 11.6% for the 100 IU/kg 
once-weekly regimen, and 7.0% for the 50 IU/kg twice-weekly regimen. By Day 120, the probability of 
failure is 14.6% for the 100 IU/kg onceweekly regimen, and 9.8% for the 50 IU/kg twice-weekly regimen. 
Survival curve analysis of time from start of the regimen until second spontaneous joint bleed comparing 
100 IU/kg once-weekly with 50 IU/kg twice-weekly using the Kaplan- Meier technique showed no 
significant difference between regimens (p=0.42, Chi-square [log-rank] test). 
4.3.3.  Discussion 
The primary objective of this study 1010 was to demonstrate that a routine prophylaxis regimen of 
BeneFIX reduces the ABR compared to on-demand treatment, in subjects with moderately severe to 
severe haemophilia B. The secondary objective was to describe the safety and efficacy of BeneFIX when 
administered for prophylaxis at a dose of 100 IU/kg once weekly. 
The prophylactic treatment regimen leads to statistically significant lower annualized bleed rates (ABR) 
compared to on-demand treatment. The applicant concludes that the primary efficacy endpoint of the 
study has been met. All sensitivity analyses supported the results of the primary endpoint and suggest 
that the significantly lower ABR in the prophylaxis period was not due to a seasonal effect. In addition, the 
mean ABR was lower in the prophylaxis period than in the on-demand period when summarized 
separately by bleed etiology (spontaneous and traumatic) and bleed location (joint, soft tissue/muscle, 
and other). 
Nonetheless, the primary objective of comparing annual bleed rates (ABR) under on-demand versus 
prophylaxis-regimen is questioned: Clinical support for Extension of the dosing interval mainly requires 
proof of protection in the late phase of the treatment interval in severely affected haemophilia patients. 
ABR in an on-demand treatment setting mainly reflects bleeding-pattern of the respective population but 
does not serve as adequate comparator for a ”new” prophylaxis regimen. 
7 out of 25 (28%) patients experienced multiple spontaneous bleeding episodes within 72 hours of a 
previous prophylaxis infusion. In addition, the presented data show, that a considerable number of 
subjects (12/25, 48%) experienced bleeds after 4 or 5 days despite being on the proposed once-weekly 
prophylaxis regimen and received additional on-demand treatment. 
Primary efficacy endpoint of study 400 was the Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR). Both prophylaxis 
regimens showed better efficacy compared with the on-demand regimen: 35.1 annualized bleeds in the 
initial on-demand treatment period compared to 4.6 (100 IU/kg once weekly) and 2.6 (50 IU/kg twice 
weekly). Between the two prophylaxis regimens no statistically significant difference in the ABR was 
found. Thus the primary objective has been met. However, significance of this finding is questioned.

Secondary objectives in terms of patient-reported outcomes provided in part some results, but their 
clinical relevance is not further discussed at this place. 
Factor IX levels (FIX:C) measured after administration of BeneFIX were dose proportional and the FIX 
recovery was similar after administration of both 50 IU/kg and 100 IU/kg.  
Regarding efficacy of such high-dosage-regimen, a major concern derives from the selection of study 
population. Long-term prophylactic treatment with BeneFIX is only indicated in subjects with severe 
haemophilia B. In study 400, as verified by the FIX baseline levels (C0h) at the start of each of the two 
prophylaxis periods, more than 60% of the subjects had FIX:C >2%, indicating only moderate or mild 
haemophilia B. According to the Supportive Tables 15.53 and 15.54, only 7 out of 40 subjects ready to 
receive 50 IU/kg (17.5%) and 8 out of 42 subjects awaiting 100 IU/kg (19%) had a FIX activity <1%, 
which defines true severe haemophilia B. 
According to the Listing 16.2.8.1.4, in study 1010, 5 out of 25 subjects (20%) had a FIX activity <1%. 
It is therefore unknown, whether the newly proposed prophylactic regimen of 100 IU/kg once weekly 
would be able to provide sufficient FIX levels and protection from bleedings over the complete 7 days 
interval in subjects with severe haemophilia B, which might benefit from long-term prophylaxis. 
In addition to that concern, no reliable trough level measurements of FIX activity are provided for the 100 
IU/kg once weekly period. Blood samples for trough level assessments were taken any time after at least 
72 hours after the last dose and are therefore meaningless for this treatment group with dosing intervals 
of 7 days. 
Real trough levels 7 days after the previous and immediately before the next 100 IU/kg dose 
administration are considered to be relevant. It is thus unclear, whether a single 100 IU/kg infusion is 
able to substitute the lacking factor IX during the entire 7 days period between dosings.

the on-demand period was similar except for the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC 
which included study medication dosing/administration errors for subjects in the prophylaxis period only, 
and in the Nervous system disorders SOC where 9 subjects in the on-demand period and only 4 subjects 
in the prophylaxis period reported TEAEs.  
Adverse Events in the Paediatric Population 
The 5 paediatric subjects enrolled in the study experienced a total of 79 AEs. All 5 paediatric subjects 
experienced AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC with Upper respiratory tract infection being 
reported in the most subjects (4 subjects). Four paediatric subjects reported AEs in the Injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications SOC including events related to study medication errors occurring in 3 
subjects and Head injury occurring in 2 subjects. In the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
SOC, 
20 events of Arthralgia were reported in 3 paediatric subjects. 
Two paediatric subjects, Subject 10171002 and Subject 10261002, experienced SAEs of Varicella and 
Pain, respectively. Both SAEs were considered not related to study drug and the subjects recovered. See 
Section  
Adverse Events Related to Study Medication 
Three subjects experienced a total of 10 TEAEs considered related to the study drug by the investigator. 
Subject 10171001 experienced mild events of Malaise (1 event) and Throat irritation (4 events) during 
the on-demand period that resolved without treatment. 
Subject 10261004 experienced Diabetes mellitus, Hyperlipidemia, and Periodontitis (2 events) during the 
prophylaxis period; all of which were considered mild in intensity and treated with concomitant 
medication. Subject 10351001 experienced a severe SAE of Blood pressure decreased which required 
treatment and was considered related to the study drug by the investigator. 
Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
No deaths were reported in this study. 
Five subjects (20.0%) reported a total of 6 SAEs. Five of the 6 SAEs were considered not related to study 
drug and 1 SAE was considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Two of the SAEs (Varicella and Pain) occurred in pediatric subjects.  
Development of FIX Inhibitor 
Samples for FIX inhibitor were collected at Visits 1, 4, and 8. 
None of the 25 subjects developed FIX inhibitor during the study as confirmed by local and central 
laboratory analysis. 
Thrombogenicity 
No thrombotic events were reported during the study. 
Samples for assessing D-Dimer and TAT laboratory biomarkers for thrombosis were collected pre-dose 
and 30 minutes post-dose at Visit 2 and at the start of the prophylaxis period (Visit 4). Incremental 
changes in D-Dimer and TAT results observed in some subjects were not associated with any clinical 
thrombotic event or TEAE. 
D-Dimer and TAT results were available for 11 subjects at Visit 2 and for 21 subjects at Visit 4. Test results 
are noted as “cancelled” or no data are listed for subjects who completed these visits before approval of

Protocol Amendment 1.  
Study 3090A1-400-WW 
The safety of BeneFIX was determined using the following assessments: monitoring of AEs, withdrawals 
due to AEs, concomitant medications, physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory determinations.  
No deaths were reported in the study; 1 subject discontinued treatment due to a serious adverse event 
(SAE) (worsening of left knee arthropathy and left knee replacement). A total of 7 SAEs were reported for 
5 unique subjects. All of these SAEs were considered to be not related to BeneFIX by the investigator and 
the medical monitor. 
Four (4) events of interest (Events with Special Circumstances [ESC]) were specifically monitored during 
the study: development of FIX inhibitors, potential allergic-type manifestations, thrombogenicity, and red 
blood cell (RBC) agglutination. These ESCs are listed in the BeneFIX Risk Management Plan and are 
monitored closely in all clinical studies conducted with BeneFIX. The investigators were trained to report 
ESC to the MAH in the same time frame as an SAE. There were no reports of ESC or other events 
associated with BeneFIX during this study.  
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurring in ≥5% of subjects during any treatment period are 
presented in Table 6. Thirty (30 [60%]) subjects reported at least 1 TEAE. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs within a treatment period were headache, arthralgia, pain, and infection. Headache was reported 
more frequently in subjects during the 100 IU/kg prophylaxis regimen. None of these TEAEs were 
assessed as related to BeneFIX by the investigator. Only 1 TEAE in Study 400-WW was assessed as 
related to BeneFIX by the investigator; 1 subject experienced a TEAE (injection site reaction [burning 
during injection]) that was reported in all 4 treatment periods and for nearly all injections; this TEAE was 
of mild severity, resolved without treatment. There were 4 subjects who reported a total of 8 TEAEs 
considered “severe.” None of these events were considered related to 
BeneFIX, none were reported during the 100 IU/kg prophylaxis regimen, and none required that the 
subjects discontinue participation in the study. 
TEAEs reported in Study 400-WW are consistent with events previously reported in the BeneFIX annual 
reassessments and PSURs. The adverse reactions observed in Study 400-WW are also consistent with 
those described provided in the BeneFIX SmPC.

One or more episodes of headache were reported for 8 (16%) subjects during Study 3090A1- 400-WW. 
Headache was reported for 3 (6.0%) subjects during the first on-demand period, 6 (13.6%) subjects 
during prophylactic treatment with 100 IU once weekly, 2 (4.5%) subjects during prophylactic treatment 
with 50 IU twice weekly, and 2 subjects (4.7%) during the second on-demand period. By comparison, in 
Studies 302 and 304, in which the doses received were generally lower than 100 IU/kg, the overall 
frequency of headache was 26% and 29%, respectively. 
Infusion rates were not recorded for Study 3090A1-400-WW, and although dates and times of infusion 
were recorded, only the dates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded. For 4 
subjects, a single instance of headache was reported on a day when there was no infusion of FIX; for 2 
other subjects, multiple instances of headache were reported, and the start dates for headache were not 
associated with days of infusions. Multiple instances of headache were reported for 2 additional subjects, 
of which 1 report for each subject occurred on the day of an infusion. 
All cases of headache were mild, none led to withdrawal from the study, none were judged by the 
investigator to be related to treatment, and all resolved. Headache is an expected adverse event for 
BeneFIX, which is listed in the product labeling as an uncommon (≥0.1% to ≤1%) adverse reaction, and 
the incidence of headache in Study 400 was not greater than in prior studies of BeneFIX (eg, 304) in 
which the doses were generally lower than those in Study 400. 
Assessor’s comment 
Except for headache, no differences between the treatment groups became apparent from the numbers 
of subjects experiencing Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) (CSR Table 15.42, summarized in 
Table 6 above). Since this is a cross-over study, all subjects went through each of the four treatment 
periods. It is therefore of note, that 13.6% of subjects experienced headache while on BeneFIX 100 IU/kg 
prophylaxis compared to only 4.5% of subjects while in the 50IU/kg twice weekly prophylaxis period and 
6.0% / 4.7% (on-demand). The MAH provided details on the events of headache. No timely relation to the 
infusion of BeneFIX was observed. 
The monitoring of events of interest or “Events with Special Circumstances” (ESC) is acknowledged: 
development of FIX inhibitors, hypersensitivity reactions, thrombotic events, and red blood cell 
agglutination. No such event was reported. 
Thrombotic Events and Laboratory Markers of Activation of Blood Coagulation 
Laboratory markers of activation of blood coagulation were not measured in Study 400. 
However in Study 1010 and several other studies, BeneFIX doses of approximately 100 IU/kg or higher 
were administered and coagulation markers were measured in these studies. 
In clinical studies of BeneFIX, 110 subjects received a total of 2973 infusions of BeneFIX that were 
approximately 100 IU/kg or higher. The number of subjects in each study and the number of infusions 
received are summarised in Table 19.

No thrombotic events were reported in any of the 110 subjects receiving approximately 100 IU/kg or 
higher in these studies. 
4.4.1.  Discussion 
Four areas of events of interest necessitating special vigilance had been identified for BeneFIX: 
development of FIX inhibitors, potential allergic-type manifestations, thrombogenicity, and red blood cell 
(RBC) agglutination. No such events were reported during the course of this clinical study.  
However, doubling the single dose of BeneFIX to 100 IU/kg as proposed with this application theoretically 
increases especially the thrombogenic risk. .  
In order to investigate a potentially increased thrombogenic risk in patients with severe haemophilia B 
after receiving BeneFIX 100 IU/kg , intravascular coagulation markers were measured in study 1010, but 
not in study 400.  
The MAH reported that in clinical studies with BeneFIX, 85 subjects received a total of 1050 infusions of 
BeneFIX of approximately 100 IU/kg or higher. In 30 of these subjects receiving 230 infusions of 
approximately 100 IU/kg or greater coagulation marker tests were performed without clinically significant 
differences to baseline values. 
High levels of factor IX increase the risk of venous thrombosis. Van Hylckama Vlieg et al [1] found a 2- to 
3-fold increased risk for individuals who have factor IX levels above 129 IU/dL compared with individuals 
having factor IX levels below this cutoff. When administering rFIX 100 IU/kg, FIX levels in this range have 
been found in the present studies. Although these high levels would only be transient and rapidly 
declining, the thrombogenic risk may be real. This should be considered when proposing such dosing for 
a long-term prophylactic treatment.  
In addition, the results of the investigations of Ameri et al [2] should be considered, who demonstrated a 
close association between elevated circulatory factor IX levels in mice with thrombosis as well as 
myocardial fibrosis.  
At the point of current investigation, thrombogenic risk of a high-dose (100 IU/kg) prophylaxis regimen 
has not been addressed although it is considered to be relevant at least in patients at risk according to 
current scientific publications. Safety data in patients > 65 years – representing a respective risk 
population are missing. The possible impact of missing (safety) data in patients >65 years of age – who 
are at higher risk for thromboembolic events – in view of the proposed higher treatment doses should be 
discussed.

Since BeneFIX is dosed in relation to body weight, overweight subjects would be exposed to extremely 
high single doses of factor IX, e.g. up to 14,000 IU in the present study. For such high doses, there is little 
clinical experience. The MAH is asked to discuss theoretical risks, mainly thrombogenicity, when 
administering such high doses of factor IX.  
It is further noted, that headache occurred more frequently during the 100 IU/kg prophylaxis period 
compared to the other treatment periods. The MAH provided details on the events of headache. No timely 
relation to the infusion of BeneFIX was observed. 
4.5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. 
 The content of the updated RMP proposed by the MAH contains the following elements: the MAH 
performed minor editorial changes across the RMP document. He further took opportunity to update 
patient exposure and safety data:

Assessor’s comment 
Off-note: In response to the last PSUR assessment report (PSUR22) the MAH agreed to update the 
BeneFIX SmPC to the new version of the Core-SmPC Guideline, effective on 01 April 2015 by adding the 
following warning in section 4.2: 
“When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor 
IX activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by 
both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance 
particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.” 
The amendment to SmPC by a type II variation was submitted on 10April 2015.  
Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
4.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed changes to the Product Information (PI) in section 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.

5.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy within this procedure, this type II variation is not 
approvable since “major objections” have been identified, which preclude a recommendation for this 
variation at the present time. The major objections relate to pharmacokinetics and efficacy and are 
provided below. 
In addition, satisfactory answers must be given to the "other concerns". 
5.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
1.  The lack of meaningful PK-data is of major concern, since they are considered to be essential in 
order to support the claimed dosage regimen. The validity of the final population PK model is 
questioned, because of higher values observed from present studies in comparison to simulated 
values gained from the final model. The lack of data on in-patient trough levels for those on 100 
IU/kg once a week combined with the experienced bleeds after 4 or 5 days all strongly suggest 
that once weekly posology is inadequate. 
Especially in patients with severe haemophilia B and/or high bleeding tendency for whom 
long-term prophylaxis might be indicated, the weekly prophylaxis regimen is thus not supported 
by clinical data. A treatment recommendation cannot be given and it should be removed from the 
SmPC, section 4.2 Posology and method of administration to section. 
Clinical efficacy 
2.  The primary objective (study 1010) of comparing annual bleed rates (ABR) under 
on-demand versus prophylaxis-regimen is questioned: Clinical support for Extension of 
the dosing interval mainly requires proof of protection in the late phase of the treatment 
interval in severely affected haemophilia patients. ABR in an on-demand treatment 
setting mainly reflects bleeding-pattern of the respective population but does not serve 
as adequate comparator for the ”new” prophylaxis regimen. 
3.  In study 400, according to their FIX:C levels, more than 60% of the subjects were at the start of 
their prophylactic treatment periods in a situation of moderate or mild haemophilia B, in the  face 
of a general sufficient washout interval. No factor IX activity was measured at baseline. Concerns 
relate to the choice of study population, to the efficacy analysis population, and to the duration of 
study treatment.  
Additionally, in study 1010 only 20% of subjects had a FIX activity <1%, which defines true 
severe haemophilia B and 48% of subjects experienced spontaneous bleeds after 4 or 5 days. 
The MAH is asked to comment on the concern, that efficacy has not been demonstrated in a 
population with true severe haemophilia B for which long term prophylaxis with BeneFIX would be 
indicated.

4.  Doubling the single dose of BeneFIX to 100 IU/kg as proposed with this application theoretically 
increases especially the thrombogenic risk.  
a)  It should also be considered, that BeneFIX is dosed in relation to body weight and 
overweight subjects would be exposed to extremely high single doses of factor IX. For 
such high doses, there is little clinical experience. Obesity itself serves as a risk-factor for 
thrombosis. The MAH is asked to discuss the theoretical thrombogenic risk when 
administering such high doses of factor IX.  
b)  The possible impact of missing (safety) data in patients >65 years of age – who are at 
higher risk for thromboembolic events – in view of the proposed higher treatment doses 
should be discussed.

The details of the SmPC wording will be performed depending on the further approach.

6.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
Question 1 
The lack of meaningful PK-data is of major concern, since they are considered to be essential in order to 
support the claimed dosage regimen. The validity of the final population PK model is questioned, because 
of higher values observed from present studies in comparison to simulated values gained from the final 
model. The lack of data on in-patient trough levels for those on 100 IU/kg once a week combined with the 
experienced bleeds after 4 or 5 days all strongly suggest that once weekly posology is inadequate. 
Especially in patients with severe haemophilia B and/or high bleeding tendency for whom long-term 
prophylaxis might be indicated, the weekly prophylaxis regimen is thus not supported by clinical data. A 
treatment recommendation cannot be given and it should be removed from the SmPC, section 4.2 
Posology and method of administration to section. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH agrees that there are no new pharmacokinetics (PK) data available for factor IX (FIX) activity 
after the administration of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once weekly dose. However here, the MAH is presenting 
new additional analysis of existing PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) data that are considered supportive of 
the proposed dosing regimen of 100 IU/kg once weekly. 
The new post hoc analysis examines the relationship between residual FIX activity observed 
approximately 1 week (±1 day) after administration of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once weekly during Study 
3090A1-400-WW and Study B1821010. As shown in Figure 1 among the 38 subjects with a FIX activity 
value collected at the time point of interest, the large majority, 76% (29/38) had FIX activity levels >1%. 
There was no apparent relationship between the level of residual FIX activity measured and the 
annualized bleeding rate (ABR) (Figure 1). Extravascular FIX binding has been proposed as one 
hypothesis for the discrepancy between PK and PD (Gui, 2002). Moreover, clinical experts in the field 
consider that PK is a somewhat less influential factor when determining an appropriate dosing regimen in 
haemophilia B. Berntorp et al, (2014) state that the “Clinical assessment of the frequency and severity 
of bleeds remain an important measure of the efficacy of treatment for haemophilia B and the role of 
PK-guided therapy remains to be established.”

Note: Broken vertical line indicates 1% FIX activity (IU/dL). 
In response to the second part of the question, the following should be considered. The development of 
the population PK model had two objectives. The first was to update a previously developed model, 
assessing the role of body weight among other covariates as being significant in explaining intersubject 
variability. The second objective was to simulate the study design of the studies presented above and 
compare the observations to what was predicted by the model. The first objective was achieved. Weight 
was identified as a significant covariate and the key parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) 
were consistent with previous analyses of the same data. Further, the population PK model was assessed 
for adequacy or goodness using current industry standards. There was no overt bias observed in the 
model and the model performance appeared to be adequate (CHMP, 2007). 
It was in the evaluation of data collected in the present studies that, as noted, there was bias between the 
predictions from the model and the observations. Possible explanations for the biases were presented, 
including the fact that the FIX recovery observed in Study 3090A1- 400-WW was higher than in any other 
BeneFIX study and the sampling times post dose in Study B1821010 were longer than in other BeneFIX 
studies. Work is ongoing to understand the potential impact of including these data in the development of 
a model, but the conclusions from the model itself, the importance of weight on PK parameters, remain 
valid.

Post hoc stepwise logistic regression analyses have been conducted by the MAH in order to evaluate 
potential clinical factors that may be used to predict the response to treatment with BeneFIX 100 IU/kg 
once-weekly prophylaxis. Data from Studies 3090A1-400-WW and B1821010 were pooled, and two 
definitions of a responder were investigated. Using the first definition, in which a responder was defined 
as a subject with no spontaneous bleeds on the BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis regimen, 
yielded a model containing the subject’s spontaneous annualised bleed rate (sABR) during the 
on-demand (OD) period as a predictor, with an estimated cut off point of 9.21 sABR during OD. A subject 
with sABR ≤9.21 during OD would likely ‘respond’ (ie, have no spontaneous bleeds) on this prophylaxis 
regimen. When a responder was defined as a subject with ≤3 sABR on this prophylaxis regimen, the 
model was very similar, and the estimated cut off was 18.3 sABR during OD. Based on the results of these 
models, the sABR during OD was associated with outcome and could potentially be used to predict which 
patients will respond. Targeting these cut off values of the sABR during OD could be considered in 
determining patients appropriate for prophylaxis treatment with BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once weekly. 
Nijdam et al, (2014) recommend starting prophylaxis treatment with one to two infusions per week, and 
then increasing the regimen according to the bleeding tendencies of the patient. In addition, the MAH 
believes that those patients with poor venous access, or who are practically challenged adhering to a 
twice-weekly regimen, would benefit from a onceweekly posology. Furthermore the MAH believes that the 
opportunity to administer BeneFIX once weekly (with the subsequent reduction in the number of infusions 
required per annum) would provide a significant advancement in the care and quality of life for patients 
with haemophilia B. 
The MAH would like to propose wording in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to indicate 
that the regimen could be of value for some patients that would require a decreased dosing frequency. 
Originally submitted wording: 
BeneFIX may be administered for long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe 
haemophilia B. In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously 
treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/kg (range 13 to 78 IU/kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days. In other clinical 
studies in moderately severe to severe haemophilia B (FIX:C ≤2%) PTPs, BeneFIX was administered as 
100 IU/kg once weekly (see section 5.1). 
Amended proposal: 
BeneFIX may be administered for long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe 
haemophilia B. In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously 
treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/kg (range 13 to 78 IU/kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days. 
In other clinical studies BeneFIX was administered as 100 IU/kg once weekly, which may be an option for 
some patients (see section 5.1). 
Note that the statement ‘In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher 
doses may be necessary’ was added in type II variation II-0133 with positive opinion on 23 July 2015. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
There are no new pharmacokinetics (PK) data available for factor IX (FIX) activity after the administration 
of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once weekly dose. 
The MAH argues that efficacy of the 100 IU/kg once weekly prophylactic regimen would have been 
demonstrated, being better than on-demand treatment and comparable to the approved 50 IU/kg twice 
weekly prophylactic regimen. Demonstration of efficacy would overcome the necessity to investigate 
pharmacokinetics and that PK would be a somewhat less influential factor when determining an 
appropriate dosing regimen in haemophilia B. This is no acceptable  profound scientific approach.

EMA/CHMP/686005/2015

The MAH referres to a publication of Berntorp et al, (2014). However, the same publication states that “PK 
parameters are good surrogates for clinical efficacy and therefore PK should be used in haemophilia when 
dosing is determined. This is the only way to introduce evidence-based prophylaxis…”    
This underlines the importance of PK which is mentioned and requested in the current “Guideline on the 
clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor IX products” (21 July 2011 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009) 
The direct aim of a long-term prophylactic factor IX replacement therapy in deficient patients is to 
maintain protective factor IX levels. Secondary to this effect, a reduction of bleedings can be expected. 
Measurement of factor IX concentration in plasma is therefore the most direct and objective 
surrogate-parameter of a treatment effect.  
Moreover, the final population PK model is still questioned. There was bias between the predictions from 
the model and the observations. The applicant attributes this bias to possible study differences (i.e. 
differences in included subjects between studies 400 & 1010), but further investigations, taking study 
effects for studies 400 and 1010 respectively into account, were not performed. Manolis et al, (2009) 
state that “the use of modelling and simulation could provide an additional degree of evidence, but is 
based on assumptions and, as such, should be supported by experimental data. It cannot and should not 
be used to replace data from well-conducted studies as primary degree of evidence.” 
Meaningful PK-data containing maximum- and trough-levels in the late phase of the treatment –interval 
(measured values in respective patients) are considered to be essential. The MAH should provide results 
of additional long-term PK investigations regarding the FIX activity following BeneFIX administration. 
Therefore, a statement in the SmPC regarding a weekly treatment regimen, as proposed by the applicant 
under section 4.2 Posology and method of administration cannot be endorsed. 
Conclusion 
Point not solved. 
The lack of meaningful PK-data remains as a major concern, since they are considered to be essential in 
order to support the claimed dosage regimen. The lack of data on in-patient trough levels for those on 100 
IU/kg once a week combined with the experienced bleeds after 4 or 5 days all strongly suggest that once 
weekly posology is inadequate to be a general SmPC recommendation. 
Clinical efficacy 
Question 2 
The primary objective (study 1010) of comparing annual bleed rates (ABR) under on-demand 
versus prophylaxis-regimen is questioned: Clinical support for Extension of the dosing interval 
mainly requires proof of protection in the late phase of the treatment interval in severely 
affected haemophilia patients. ABR in an on-demand treatment setting mainly reflects 
bleeding-pattern of the respective population but does not serve as adequate comparator for 
the ”new” prophylaxis regimen. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis regimen has been evaluated in comparison to a more 
frequent prophylaxis regimen and against on-demand treatment. It is important to note the consistent

efficacy shown in Study B1821010, a pivotal, prospective, 52-week trial of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once 
weekly where 48% (12/25) of subjects experienced no spontaneous bleeds. Similarly, 48% of subjects 
experienced no traumatic bleeds while 52% (13/25) experienced no joint bleeds and 84% (21/25) 
experienced no soft tissue or muscle bleeds. Spontaneous bleeds with the once-weekly prophylaxis 
regimen occurred at varying daily rates and did not show a pattern with respect to timing post-dose 
(Figure 2), (Tortella et al, 2015). The efficacy of the BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once-weekly regimen has been 
published (Study 3090A1-400-WW, Valentino et al, 2014), and presented at international scientific 
meetings (Kavakli et al, 2014), therefore the MAH is proposing that this be reflected in the posology.

Once-weekly Prophylaxis Regimen.

The BeneFIX once-weekly prophylaxis program was initiated in 2007, with Study 3090A1-400-WW 
(Study 400). The purpose of Study 400 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 BeneFIX prophylaxis 
regimens (50 IU/kg twice weekly and 100 IU/kg once weekly). In this study, the efficacy of the 
once-weekly prophylaxis regimen was superior to on-demand treatment with respect to the ABR, and was 
not different when compared with the twiceweekly prophylaxis regimen. 
A post-hoc analysis of Study 400 was performed with the objective to evaluate the treatment failure (time 
until first spontaneous bleed) of both prophylaxis regimens. Survival curve analysis of time from start of 
regimen to first spontaneous bleed comparing 100 IU/kg once weekly with 50 IU/kg twice weekly using 
the Kaplan-Meier technique showed no significant difference in the timing or extent of either type of 
treatment failure. No statistical differences (Chi-squared [log-rank] analysis) were observed between the 
two regimens for both, joint bleeds (p=0.14), (Figure 3) and soft tissue/muscle bleeds (p= 0.61), (Figure 
4).

The safety profile was similar across both doses (50 IU/kg twice weekly and 100 IU/kg once weekly); 
there was no impact on tolerability due to the increased dose (100 IU/kg once weekly). Based on these 
results, the 100 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis regimen for Study B1821010 was selected, based on the 
patient’s convenience due to the reduction of the infusions. The MAH has conducted a confirmatory 
pivotal study, Study B1821010, that compared the safety and efficacy of a once-weekly prophylaxis (100 
IU/kg) regimen versus an on-demand treatment regimen. Study B1821010 demonstrated a significant 
reduction of the ABR with 100 IU/kg once-weekly continuous prophylaxis in comparison to the on demand 
treatment. Studies 400 and B1821010 have reported a similar ABR rate with 100 IU/kg once-weekly 
continuous prophylaxis. The ability to dose at extended, weekly intervals is generally considered by 
physicians and patients to be a significant medical advancement in the treatment of haemophilia. 
The once-weekly regimen becomes more meaningful in the context of the recently reported 33.8 hour 
half-life (geometric mean) for BeneFIX (Powell et al, 2013). Preclinical studies suggest the presence of 
extravascular factor IX bound to endothelial cells (Gui et al, 2002). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In study 1010, the primary objective of comparing annual bleed rates (ABR) under on-demand versus 
prophylaxis-regimen is questioned, because ABR in an on-demand treatment does not serve as adequate 
comparator for the ”new” prophylaxis regimen. 
The MAH stated that based on the results of study 400, the 100 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis regimen 
for Study1010 was selected, based on the patient’s convenience due to the reduction of the infusions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 51/61 
 
  
  
 
 
In study 400, both prophylactic treatment regimens (50IU/kg twice weekly and 100 IU/kg once weekly) 
lead to statistically significant lower annualized bleed rates (ABR) compared to on-demand treatment. 
There is no statistically significant difference in ABR between the 50 IU/kg twice weekly and the 100 IU/kg 
once weekly prophylactic schedule. The applicant concludes that the primary efficacy endpoint of the 
study has been met.  But the duration of 16 weeks with the newly proposed dose regimen is of concern. 
According to the ‘Guideline on clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor IX 
products’ (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009), for the assessment of clinical efficacy of factor IX in 
long-term prophylaxis, patients should be treated for 6 months and assessed for bleeding episodes, 
bleeding intervals and number of treatments. 
Moreover, in study 400 efficacy has not been demonstrated in a population with true severe haemophilia 
B. (see MO 3) 
Half-life was not determined, neither in study 400 nor in study 1010, but anticipated as being 
approximately 18 hours (results of earlier studies of BeneFIX). The MAH refers to a study of Powell et al, 
which published a FIX:C half-life of 33 hours after BeneFIX administration. A subgroup of 22 participants 
in this study completed a baseline pharmacokinetic assessment. It is important to point out that the 
terminal half-life was 33.8 hours and the half-life, calculated on the basis of the traditional 48-hour 
pharmacokinetic sampling schedule, was 17.04 hours (95% CI, 15.89 to 18.26), which is similar to 
previously reported 48-hour-data. The time to reach a factor IX level of 1 IU/dL (1%) was 5.1 days (95% 
CI, 4.6 to 5.7). Therefore, these data do not support an addition of a once-weekly 100 IU/kg prophylaxis 
regimen. In study 400 mean peak values of 49.9 IU/dL (after infusion of 50 IU/kg) and 91.5 IU/dL (after 
infusion of 100 IU/kg) were found. With an anticipated half-life of 18 hours reported for BeneFIX it is 
assumed that FIX levels return to pre-infusion levels after 72 hours. 
Summarizing, demonstration of efficacy in the long-term prophylaxis with BeneFIX 100 IU/kg once 
weekly is not regarded sufficient. In study 400, concerns relate to the choice of study population, to the 
efficacy analysis population, and to the duration of study treatment.  Therefore, study 400 can only be 
used as support and cannot replace an adequate study design in study 1010. 
Conclusion 
Point not solved. 
Question 3 
In study 400, according to their FIX:C levels, more than 60% of the subjects were at the start of their 
prophylactic treatment periods in a situation of moderate or mild haemophilia B, in the  face of a general 
sufficient washout interval. No factor IX activity was measured at baseline. Concerns relate to the choice 
of study population, to the efficacy analysis population, and to the duration of study treatment.  
Additionally, in study 1010 only 20% of subjects had a FIX activity <1%, which defines true severe 
haemophilia B and 48% of subjects experienced spontaneous bleeds after 4 or 5 days. 
The MAH is asked to comment on the concern, that efficacy has not been demonstrated in a population 
with true severe haemophilia B for which long term prophylaxis with BeneFIX would be indicated.   
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Inadequate washout was a potential issue in clearly identifying the severity of haemophilia in the subjects 
enrolled in Study 3090A1-400-WW (Study 400). At the time of the study conduct, the longer half-life of 
Assessment report

FIX activity (33 hours), described by Powell et al, (2013) after BeneFIX administration was not 
appreciated. Subjects included in Study 400 could be moderately severe (FIX activity ≤2%) or severe 
(FIX activity ≤1%). Although it would be more rigorous to demonstrate this prior to inclusion in the study, 
any observation of FIX activity ≤2% would be evidence that these subjects were appropriately enrolled. 
Per protocol, FIX activity was measured on 6 scheduled occasions over the duration of the study, before 
and after each recovery dose, and twice during the prophylaxis treatment, at least 72 hours after a 
previous dose. All of the available FIX activity data were examined and the lowest activity (ie, the lowest 
observation for each subject), along with the testing occasion, are shown below in Table 1 (Study 400) 
and Table 2 (Study B1821010 or Study 1010). Since FIX activity was evaluated by local laboratories, the 
reported precision varied. Twenty-eight of 45 subjects (62%) had FIX activity of severe or moderately 
severe, ≤2%.

Based on the analysis of data (B1821010 Clinical Study Report, Supportive Table 14.2.3) performed by 
the MAH, 13 subjects reported a total of 64 episodes of spontaneous bleeding; 32% (8/25) subjects 
reported a spontaneous bleed “after day 4” (ie, on days 5, 6, or 7) at least once after a prophylaxis dose; 
28% (7/25) subjects reported a spontaneous bleed “after day 5” (ie, on days 6, or 7) at least once after 
a prophylaxis dose. 
The MAH would also like to provide some newly available supportive external registry data in this 
response. The United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO) is an association of 
medical practitioners who work within the Haemophilia Centres of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or 
Wales. The UKHCDO is required by the Department of Health to collect data on diagnosis, management 
and complications of bleeding disorders. This information is kept in the National Haemophilia Database. 
The attached analysis by Prof. Charles Hay (Personal Communication, 2015) describes the realworld- use 
of BeneFIX in severe haemophilia B patients (FIX ≤1%) as a once-weekly regimen as documented in the 
National Haemophilia Database. Patient-level data are provided as well as Prof. Hay’s interpretation of 
the data. The MAH would like to highlight that this supportive data provided by the UKHCDO has been 
provided in response to a request from the MAH. These data and its interpretation represent the opinion 
of Professor Hay and the MAH has had no input. 
For both 2013 and 2014, 11 severe haemophilia B patients (10 patients, ≥18 years of age; 1 patient, <18 
years of age) were identified and confirmed by their centers as using BeneFIX once-weekly (please refer 
to Prof. Hay’s report for detailed information on the patient identification process). This corresponded to 
11.5% of adults (≥18 yrs) and 2% of children (<18 yrs) using Haemtrack (the UKHCDO electronic patient 
diary system) and reporting BeneFIX prophylaxis in 2013. 
This group of patients was selected by UK clinicians for a once-weekly regimen for a number of reasons 
that include convenience for the patient, or because of poor venous access, or because they were unable 
to comply with more demanding twice weekly prophylaxis regimens. 
In the cohort analysed by Professor Hay , once weekly prophylaxis appeared haemostatically effective, 
with an acceptably low median annualised bleed-rate of 3 in 2013 and 1 in 2014 despite the use of 
significantly lower weekly doses of BeneFIX than were reported by Valentino et al, (2014). The ABR 
reported with weekly prophylaxis was very similar to that reported for UK patients with severe 
haemophilia B using twice weekly prophylaxis whose median ABR in 2013 was 2.5 (IQR 0-10) and 2 (IQR 
0.75-10) in 2014 (n= 42 and 48 respectively, selected using the same selection criteria). 
In this analysis, the treatment appeared safe and no adverse events (including thrombosis, inhibitor 
development, poor efficacy event) were reported. The report concludes that there is a place for BeneFIX 
once-weekly prophylaxis and that many more patients may be suitable for this approach. This report 
demonstrates that BeneFIX as a once-weekly regimen has been used effectively and with a favourable 
safety profile in real-world clinical practice in a group of severe haemophoilia B patients (FIX ≤1%) in the 
UK in 2013 and 2014. Of particular interest are the two patients who had been poorly compliant with twice 
weekly prophylaxis or had refused twice weekly prophylaxis, and they have been found to be compliant 
with the BeneFIX once-weekly regimen. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that at baseline no factor IX activity was measured in study 400. The MAH states that 
inadequate washout was a potential issue in clearly identifying the severity of haemophilia in the subjects 
enrolled in Study 400 and that the longer half-life of FIX activity (33 hours), described by Powell et al, 
(2013) after BeneFIX administration was “not appreciated”.  
However, this can be excluded by checking Supportive Table 3.4 ‘Listing of infusion and bleed events for 
subjects in Study 400’, which lists all factor IX administrations during the study. These listings show that 
in all but two cases the interval between last dosing and C0h measurement was at least 3 days, so the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/686005/2015 
Page 55/61 
 
  
  
washout interval was in general sufficient and the FIX level an innate one. In addition, the PK data of the 
longer half-life of FIX activity (33 hours), described by Powell et al, (2013) do not support an addition of 
a once-weekly 100 IU/kg prophylaxis regimen. (see Rapporteur’s Assessment of MO 2). 
The MAH submits new analyses of data about the lowest Individual FIX Activity for Subjects in Study 400. 
Thus, 17 of 45 subjects (38%) had FIX activity of moderate or even mild, ≥2% and only 14 subjects (31%) 
had a FIX activity <1%.  
The MAH presented the same analysis in a similar way for study 1010. Therefore, 23 of 25 subjects (92%) 
have documented FIX activity below the limit of detection (<1%). 
For study 400 the concern remains that only a minority of the study population was affected by true 
severe haemophilia B, for study 1010 the point is resolved. 
Please accept the apologies from Rapporteur regarding the statement “and 48% of subjects experienced 
spontaneous bleeds after 4 or 5 days” reflecting a typing error.  Clarification: In study 1010, thirteen 
subjects (52.0%) experienced 64 spontaneous bleeds during the prophylaxis period. 8 out of these 13 
subjects (32%) experienced spontaneous bleeds after 4 or 5 days, that means >96-≤168 hours. (see 
Supportive Tabel 14.2.3 “Number of spontaneous bleeding episodes by time between previous 
prophylaxis infusion and start of bleed - include subjects who had at least one bleed during the 
prophylaxis period”). 
Nevertheless, the bleeding rate achieved during this regimen cannot regarded as sufficient, considering 
that prophylactic treatment would usually aim at a marked reduction in breakthrough bleeding frequency. 
The MAH also provided external registry data. Those data are noted. However, it is also pointed out that 
the results derived from a very small population (11 severe haemophilia B patients). Overall, registry 
data could be supportive but do not replace long-term PK investigations regarding the FIX activity 
following BeneFIX administration. 
Conclusion 
Point partially solved.  
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 4 
Doubling the single dose of BeneFIX to 100 IU/kg as proposed with this application theoretically increases 
especially the thrombogenic risk.  
a)  It should also be considered, that BeneFIX is dosed in relation to body weight and 
overweight subjects would be exposed to extremely high single doses of factor IX. For 
such high doses, there is little clinical experience. Obesity itself serves as a risk-factor for 
thrombosis. The MAH is asked to discuss the theoretical thrombogenic risk when 
administering such high doses of factor IX.  
b)  The possible impact of missing (safety) data in patients >65 years of age – who are at 
higher risk for thromboembolic events – in view of the proposed higher treatment doses 
should be discussed.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has previously provided data from clinical studies with BeneFIX, where 85 subjects received a 
total of 1050 infusions of BeneFIX of approximately 100 IU/kg or greater. Six subjects had body mass 
index (BMI) values of 30 to 43 kg/m2 and would be classified as obese. In 30 of these subjects receiving 
230 infusions of approximately 100 IU/kg or greater, coagulation marker tests were performed (see 
section 2.5.5.2.4, Clinical Overview for this application). Results showed no clinically significant 
differences from baseline values. There were no observed clinical manifestations of thrombotic events. A 
discussion of the theoretical thrombogenic risk when administering high doses of BeneFIX in obese 
patients is provided below. 
Peak FIX activity, collected 30 minutes after administration of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg, was measured in Study 
400 and Study 1010. The potential relationship between peak FIX activity and bodyweight, and BMI were 
assessed and these data are presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. Both analyses show a 
significant correlation, in that as weight and BMI increased, the peak FIX activity also increased, as has 
been reported previously for FVIII activity (Bjorkman et al, 2012). However, even among the heaviest 
individuals and those with the highest BMI, none of the FIX activity observed was above the upper limit 
of normal of most clinical laboratories (120 to 160 IU/dL for the laboratories used in Study 400). It should 
also be considered that FIX activities decrease from their peak steadily in patients with haemophilia 
because of their inability to synthesize replacement FIX, and therein are unlike individuals with normal 
coagulation factor production who have sustained FIX activities in the normal range.

peak observed after the 100 IU/kg dose was very low.

(n=68) 
Source:Listings for Demographic data and FIX activity. Note: The data for subject 4001101 were included although the 
peak observed after the 100 IU/kg dose was very low. 
In consideration of the above analyses and the literature previously cited, Van Hylckama Vlieg et al, 
(2000) reported a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for individuals who have FIX levels above 129 IU/dL when 
compared with individuals having FIX levels below this cut-off. In the analysis presented above of peak 
FIX activity (collected 30 minutes after infusion of 100 IU/kg) 5/68 (7.4%) subjects analysed achieved 
peak FIX levels above the threshold of 129 IU/dL (these subjects had peak FIX activity values of 129, 129, 
139, 146, and 155 IU/dL). Ameri et al, (2003) reported that transgenic mice with elevated circulatory FIX 
levels had increased risk of thrombosis, myocardial fibrosis and shorter life span. However, these are 
models of higher sustained plasma levels of FIX, unlike the transient FIX peak activity observed in 
patients with haemophilia following administration of FIX replacement therapy. Moreover, it is unclear if 
these published data in non-haemophiliac patients and in transgenic mice can be extrapolated to risks 
associated with the treatment of haemophilia patients. 
In line with the FIX Core SmPC, the BeneFIX SmPC (as amended in variation II-0133) now includes within 
section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use the statement “In patients with existing 
cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the cardiovascular risk”, in 
addition to information on thromboembolism and potential risk of thrombotic complications. Moreover, 
the BeneFIX SmPC now includes within section 4.2 Posology and Method of Administration the statement 
“Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients” alerting the 
physician to the potential need to adjust dosage in underweight or overweight patients. In addition, 
section 4.2 advises the physician that “During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of 
factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions”.

Lastly, within the Risk Management Plan thrombogenicity is an identified risk that is subject to ongoing 
routine pharmacovigilance. 
In conclusion, based on the analyses presented within the context of this response, together with the data 
previously presented, the MAH considers that there is no evidence that obese patients would be placed at 
increased risk through administration of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg. 
Experience with BeneFIX in patients >65 years is limited, as the elderly patients comprise approximately 
2% of the total haemophilia A and B population, and approximately 1% of the total population with severe 
disease (Philipp, 2010). As already acknowledged by the assessor, this is a population for which 
information is missing, as also indicated within the approved Risk Management Plan (version 8.1, review 
completed with variation II-0133) and the Risk Management Plan revised in this application (version 9.0). 
Consequently, there are insufficient data upon which conclusions can be made in regards to the 
administration of BeneFIX 100 IU/kg to this population. However, in line with the FIX Core SmPC, the 
BeneFIX SmPC (amended in variation II-0133) now includes within section 4.4 Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use, the statement “In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution 
therapy with FIX may increase the cardiovascular risk”, in addition to information on thromboembolism 
and potential risk of thrombotic complications. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Preclinical and clinical investigations regarding thrombogenicity were performed. The MAH reported that 
in clinical studies with BeneFIX, 85 subjects received a total of 1050 infusions of BeneFIX of 
approximately 100 IU/kg or higher. Six subjects had body mass index (BMI) values of 30 to 43 kg/m2 and 
would be classified as obese. In 30 of these subjects receiving 230 infusions of approximately 100 IU/kg 
or greater coagulation marker tests were performed without clinically significant differences to baseline 
values.  The MAH submits an analysis which assessed the potential relationship between peak FIX activity 
and bodyweight, and BMI. Even among the heaviest individuals and those with the highest BMI, none of 
the FIX activity observed was above the upper limit of normal of most clinical laboratories (120 to 160 
IU/dL for the laboratories used in Study 400). 
In line with the FIX Core SmPC, the BeneFIX SmPC (as amended in variation II-0133) now includes within 
section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use the statement “In patients with existing 
cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the cardiovascular risk”, in 
addition to information on thromboembolism and potential risk of thrombotic complications. Moreover, 
the BeneFIX SmPC now includes within section 4.2 Posology and Method of Administration the statement 
“Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients” alerting the 
physician to the potential need to adjust dosage in underweight or overweight patients. In addition, 
section 4.2 advises the physician that “During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of 
factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions”.  
The MAH confirmed that patients >65 years is a population for which information is missing. In line with 
the FIX Core SmPC, the BeneFIX SmPC (amended in variation II-0133) now includes within section 4.4 
Special Warnings and Precautions for Use, the statement “In patients with existing cardiovascular risk 
factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the cardiovascular risk”, in addition to information on 
thromboembolism and potential risk of thrombotic complications. 
Conclusion 
Point resolved.

SmPC aspects 
The details of the SmPC wording will be performed depending on the further approach. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Please see the revised wording proposed for SmPC section 4.2 under response 1b above. Changes 
originally proposed for Section 5.1 and 5.2 are as previously submitted and have not been amended. Note 
that the annexes now provided include the changes from procedure II- 0133 which reached positive CHMP 
opinion on 23 July 2015. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH’s response is not acceptable. 
A treatment recommendation cannot be given and it should be removed from the SmPC, section 4.2 
Posology and method of administration. Because of a variety of deficiencies, as outlined in the 
assessment report, presenting the study results in section 5.1 in the way as the MAH wishes is not 
acceptable. 
However, it might be acceptable to give some information in SmPC section 5.1 on the use of this 
prophylactic regimen. A wording is proposed: 
‘In two open-label studies BeneFIX was found to be safely administered at 100 IU/kg once weekly. 
However, the short half-life of the product and the limited PK study data do not allow recommending this 
regimen in general for long-term prophylaxis in severe haemophilia B patients.’ 
If the MAH wishes to accept this proposal a revised PI including the proposed wording in 
section 5.1. should be submitted. 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly. 
Additional MAH’s response submitted via EUDRALINK on 09th October 2015 
The MAH has accepted the proposal made by Rapporteur to include some information in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC on the use of this prophylactic regimen. The MAH has submitted a revised product information with 
a proposal in section 5.1, which has been slightly modified to the proposal made by Rapporteur. 
The following wording for section 5.1 is proposed by the MAH: 
“In two open-label studies BeneFIX was found to be safely administered at 100 IU/kg once-weekly. 
However, the half-life of the product (see section 5.2) and the limited pharmacokinetic study data for the 
once-weekly regimen do not allow recommending this regimen in general for long-term prophylaxis in 
severe haemophilia B patients.” 
Conclusion 
The above mentioned wording foe section 5.1 of the SmPC as proposed by the Rapporteur and slightly 
modified by the MAH is acceptable. 
The MAH should implement this change with a consolidated eCTD Sequence into the dossier. 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly.

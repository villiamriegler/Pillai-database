Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nalmefene, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on ‘visual impairment’ from clinical trial(s) and spontaneous reports including 
in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC 
Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between nalmefene and ‘visual impairment’ is at least a 
reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products 
containing nalmefene should be amended accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nalmefene the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nalmefene is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

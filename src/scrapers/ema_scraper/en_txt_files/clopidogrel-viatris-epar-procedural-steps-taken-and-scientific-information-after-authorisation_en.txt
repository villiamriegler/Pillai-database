Renewal of the marketing authorisation.

SmPC, 
The MAH has not performed any efficacy studies in the 
Labelling and 
period after the initial marketing authorisation or provided 
PL 
any literature review on the efficacy/effectiveness. The 
MAH refers in the clinical overview to the modifications of 
the SmPC confirming the efficacy of clopidogrel in the 
proposed indications. On the basis of the review of the 
safety information covering the period of this renewal, the 
CHMP concluded that the safety profile of Apotex remains 
favourable in the approved indications. In line with the 
reference medicinal product it is recommended to continue 
close monitoring of all reports of adverse reactions received 
from worldwide sources and the occurrence of late stent 
thrombosis after clopidogrel withdrawal for the next 
reporting interval and cumulatively follow the literature for 
potential new emerging information that may alter the 
efficacy-safety of clopidogrel. 
The CHMP recommends that the renewal be granted with 
unlimited validity.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell neoplasm that stems from the malignant transformation of plasma 
cells in  the  bone  marrow and  is  characterized  by  the  accumulation  of  clonal plasma  cells in  the  bone 
marrow  (Boyd,  2012;  Palumbo,  2011).  Multiple myeloma  accounts  for  approximately  10%  to  18% of 
haematologic cancers (Mateos, 2014; Siegel, 2016). In Europe, 38,900 new cases of MM and 24,300 
deaths due to MM were estimated in 2012 (Ferlay, 2013). Multiple myeloma is a disease of the elderly

(San Miguel, 2013a), with an overall median age at manifestation of approximately 70 years (Ludwig, 
2014). 
Currently no drug has been approved in the post-ASCT setting (TE NDMM) by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) or by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The  most  recent  NCCN  guidelines,  define  lenalidomide  and  thalidomide  as  Category  1  therapies  for 
maintenance therapy post-ASCT (NCCN, 2016).  
The lenalidomide mechanism of action includes anti-neoplastic, anti-angiogenic, pro-erythropoietic, 
and immunomodulatory properties. Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of certain 
haematopoietic tumour cells (including multiple myeloma [MM] plasma tumour cells and those with 
deletions of chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and 
increases the number of NK T cells, inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of 
endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin production by 
CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α 
and IL-6) by monocytes. In MDS Del (5q), lenalidomide was shown to selectively inhibit the abnormal 
clone by increasing the apoptosis of Del (5q) cells (SmPC section 5.1). 
The current indication for Revlimid is as follows: 
Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma 
who are not eligible for transplant (see section 4.2). 
Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 
adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or 
intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. 
Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for the following indication: Revlimid is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone 
autologous stem cell transplantation. 
The recommended indication for approval is: Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone 
autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide maintenance should be initiated after adequate haematologic recovery following ASCT. 
Lenalidomide must not be started if the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is < 1.0 x 109/L, and/or 
platelet counts are < 75 x 109/L. 
The recommended starting dose is lenalidomide 10 mg orally once daily continuously (on days 1-28 of 
repeated 28-day cycles) given until disease progression or intolerance. After 3 cycles of lenalidomide 
maintenance, the dose can be increased to 15 mg orally once daily if tolerated. Dosing is continued or 
modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (SmPC section 4.2). 
In this application, the MAH submitted 2 type IB variations to add 7-day pack sizes for the 10 mg and 
15  mg  strengths  in  order  to  support  the  starting  dose  and  dose  modifications.  These  changes  are 
acceptable to the CHMP.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA was submitted in this application (see Discussion and Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.2.  Discussion and Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An ERA was submitted for a previous extension of indication, covering MDS population and the overall 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) population regardless of the stage of the disease. Revlimid was considered to 
pose  negligible  risk  to  the  environment  and  no  updated  ERA  was  required  by  CHMP  for  this  current 
extension  of  indication.  The  new/extended  indication  does  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in 
environmental exposure further to the use of Revlimid. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized to receive continuously once a day lenalidomide (experimental arm) or 
placebo  (control  arm)  as  maintenance  therapy  between  Day  100  and  Day  110  post-
transplantation.  The  starting  dose  was  10  mg/day,  escalated  to  15  mg/day  after  3  months  if  the 
subjects was able to tolerate the treatment, and continued until disease progression. Maintenance 
treatment was stopped and/or dose reduced as needed to manage toxicity. 
Upon unblinding, patients  who were receiving placebo were allowed to cross over to lenalidomide 
before  progressive  disease  (PD),  and  patients  who  were  receiving  lenalidomide  could  continue 
treatment per the original protocol.

b Subjects underwent disease and response evaluation between Day +90 and Day +100 after transplant and before 
randomization. 
c Before randomization, subjects must have had adequate organ function (ANC ≥ 1000/μL, PLT ≥ 75,000/μL, serum 
creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL, bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST ≤ 3  ULN, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 x ULN) and must have 
had no evidence of PD. Randomization to study drug occurred between Day +90 to Day +100 after transplant. 
Initiation of maintenance therapy began between Day +100 and Day +110 after transplant. 
d Study drug (lenalidomide or placebo) was started at a dose of 10 mg PO daily (2 capsules per day). After 3 
months, the dose was to be increased to 15 mg PO daily (3 capsules per day), provided ANC ≥ 1000/μL, PLT ≥ 
75,000/μL, and all nonhematologic toxicity was ≤ Grade 1. Doses could be reduced to 5 mg PO daily or 5 mg PO 
daily every 21 of 28 days if not tolerated at higher doses. Dosing could continue until PD or treatment intolerance. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  lenalidomide  in  prolonging  time  to  disease 
progression in patients with multiple myeloma after ASCT; in particular, to investigate if maintenance 
lenalidomide  would  prolong  time  to  progression  or  death  (ie,  PFS)  following  single  ASCT.Secondary 
objectives were (i) to determine if lenalidomide increases the complete response (CR) rate in patients 
with MM following ASCT, (ii) to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with MM who underwent ASCT 
and  then  were  randomized  to  either  lenalidomide  or  placebo;  and  (iii)  to  determine  the  feasibility  of 
long-term administration of lenalidomide to MM patients who underwent ASCT. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/108277/2017  
Page 13/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS.  This  endpoint  was  referred  to  as  time  to  progression  (TTP)  in  the 
protocol;  however,  as  defined  in  the  protocol,  the  analysis  of  TTP  was  equivalent  to  a  standard  PFS 
analysis, ie, defined as PD or death due to any cause. 
The  secondary  endpoints  were  overall  survival,  rates  for  the  various  types  of  responses  at 
prerandomization (3 months post-ASCT) and 12 months post-ASCT, and the improvement in response 
(e.g., PR to CR) over the aforementioned time points. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints include PFS2, type of second-line therapies, and second progression-
free survival (second-line PFS). 
Sample size 
The plan was to randomize N = 462 subjects over a period of 33 months (targeted number of events= 
309). It was anticipated that this would require, to account for a drop-out rate of 15%, about N = 544 
subjects  registered  over  this  period.  Under  an  equal  allocation  randomization  scheme  (i.e.,  231 
subjects randomized to each arm) and a planned follow-up period of 30 months at the α = 0.05 level 
of significance, this design would have had a power of at least 0.9 for the one-sided log-rank test. The 
total study period was expected to be 63 months. 
The study was opened on 15 December 2004. Accrual to the study did not begin until April 2005. The 
protocol  amendment  (version  7,  15  Jun  2008)  continued  accrual  to  the  study  for  an  additional  30 
months,  starting  April  2007.  It  was  assumed  that  the  accrual  rate  would  remain  constant  at  16  per 
month  for  another  21  months.  Given  that  the  study  had  been  open  for  28  months  (December  2004 
through March 2007), and that the plan was to accrue for another 30 months (starting April 2007) and 
to  follow  the  last  subject  for  30  months,  the  total  study  period  would  be  28+30+30  =  88  months 
(compared  to  63  months in  the  original  design).  A  total  of 117  subjects  were accrued  through  March 
2007. An additional 421 subjects would be accrued, for a total of 538 subjects (compared to 544 in the 
original design). The revised total study period was 88 months, and the revised accrual goal was 538. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 within 90-100 days after ASCT to receive either lenalidomide or placebo 
maintenance. Patients were stratified by β2 microglobulin (elevated [≥ 2.5 mg/L] versus normal), prior 
therapy with thalidomide (yes versus no), and prior therapy with lenalidomide (yes versus no). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial.

Statistical methods 
The  ITT  post-ASCT  population  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  receive 
lenalidomide  maintenance  (lenalidomide)  versus  placebo/no  maintenance  treatment  (placebo).  This 
population is used for all efficacy analyses. 
The  safety  population  was  used  for  the  analysis  of  treatment  duration  and  included  all  subjects  who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug. This population is used for all safety analyses.

The  first  planned  interim  analysis  was  reviewed  by  the  data  and  safety  monitoring  board  (DSMB)  in 
June  2009.  After  reviewing  interim  analysis  results,  the  DSMB  requested  an  updated  analysis.  The 
updated analysis was reviewed by the DSMB and included an estimated 28% of the expected number 
of  events  (progression  or death)  at  a  data  cut-off date  of 09  September 2009.  The  DSMB  found  that 
the  study  showed  a  significantly  longer  PFS  following  ASCT  for  those  subjects  receiving  lenalidomide 
than those receiving placebo. This led to the release of the results on 17 December 2009. Treatment 
assignments  were  unblinded  on  17  December  2009  and  the  randomization  was  stopped.  Those 
subjects  who  were  unblinded  and  determined  to  be  on  lenalidomide,  continued  on  maintenance 
therapy with lenalidomide until progression as planned. For subjects who were receiving placebo at the 
time  of  unblinding,  it  was  recommended  by  the  DSMB  that  the  placebo  therapy  be  stopped  and  the 
subjects be given the opportunity to initiate lenalidomide therapy. 
A  PFS  analysis  from  randomization  was  performed  based  on  the  EMA  censoring  rules,  with  the 
additional censoring of the 76 subjects in the placebo arm at the time of crossover. Censoring at the 
time  of  lenalidomide  crossover  was  intended  to  remove  any  possible  effect  of  lenalidomide  after 
crossover.  Due  to  the  additional  censoring,  subjects  with  an  original  PFS  event  became  censored  or 
censoring dates were moved to an earlier date for these 76 subjects.

Recruitment 
The first patient was randomized on the 19th August 2005.  The study was unblinding on 17 December 
2009 and the last patient was randomized on the 27th November 2009. 
Conduct of the study 
Nineteen  protocol  amendments  or  revisions  were  made  throughout  the  period  covered  by  this  study 
report. Significant protocol changes to the clinical study report are outlined below:   
•  Amendment  3,  dated  15  May  2006,  reduced  the  time  requirement  for  stable  or  responsive 
disease in the eligibility criteria from 4 months to 2 months. The prior treatment criterion of 
at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery to be eligible for the 
study was deleted. Cyclophosphamide dosing for the ASCT procedure was modified. 
•  Amendment  5,  dated  15  May  2007,  allowed  the  mobilization  of  autologous  stem  cells  to  be 
performed  according  to  institutional  guidelines  and  allowed  for  additional  dosing  options  for 
melphalan for the ASCT procedure. Cyclophosphamide was removed from the treatment plan, 
allowing for institutions to follow their own local procedures for stem cell mobilization. 
•  Amendment  7,  dated  15  June  2008,  added  a  new  eligibility  criterion  specifying  a  required 
number of stem cells to be collected. The schedule for stem cell collection and transplant was 
revised. The statistical section was revised to address accrual and interim analyses. 
•  Amendment  8,  dated  15  August  2009,  revised  the  eligibility  criteria  so  that  no  more  than  2 
prior  therapy  regimens  (not  including  dexamethasone  alone)  were  allowed,  and  patients  who 
underwent peripheral blood stem cell collection before or after study registration were eligible. 
Instructions for dosing by corrected body weight were changed so that only melphalan therapy 
Assessment report

Page 17/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(rather than all transplant therapy) and growth factor drug doses were to be determined using 
a  corrected  body  weight  formula.  Subjects  with  relapsed  disease  (recurrence  of  disease  after 
attaining a CR) should continue on treatment if they do not fulfill criteria for PD. 
•  Amendment  10,  dated  15  February  2010,  noted  the  recent  unblinding  of  treatment 
assignments and recommendations for continuation of therapy. Continuation of Therapy Form 
(Unblinding)  was  introduced  to  capture  the  subjects  who  continued  on  or  crossed  over  to 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy.  
•  Amendment  12,  dated  13  May  2011,  required  collection  of  data  on  SPMs.  Cancer  Screening 
Form  was  introduced  for  this  purpose  and  was  to  be  submitted  every  6  months,  beginning  6 
months after randomization, until death. Instructions for reporting SPMs were revised, and all 
SPMs were to be reported through AdEERS. 
•  Amendment 17, dated 15 October 2012, allowed for the continued collection of certain subject 
data  to  accommodate  the  subjects  who  remain  on  study  treatment  longer  than  the  10-year 
mark. Data will continue to be collected as long as the subject is on study treatment. 
The subsequent changes in the statistical analyse plan (dated 19 August 2015) are described below: 
•  Additional  analyses  of  PFS  using  FDA  censoring  rules  based;  the  PFS  analysis  for  the  original 
CSR dated 04 Jan 2013 was performed using EMA censoring rules. 
• 
For PFS and OS, additional subgroup analyses have been added. 
•  Analysis of PFS2, an additional efficacy endpoint proposed by the EMA particularly valuable in 
the maintenance setting. 
•  Analysis of second-line PFS, measured as time from start of second line therapy to second PD 
or start of third line therapy. 
•  Summary of second line therapy and subsequent therapies. 
•  Response post-ASCT will be based on the central review, instead of investigator assessments, 
as VGPR could not be marked by investigator following the IMWG response criteria for majority 
of the post-ASCT assessments (mistaken change of CRF). 
•  Based on study unblinding in 17 December 2009 and the option for subjects to cross-over from 
placebo  to  lenalidomide  safety  will  be  analyzed  according  to  the  following  cohorts:  i) 
randomized  to  lenalidomide  and  treated  ii)  randomized  to  placebo  but  treated  with 
lenalidomide  after  study  unblinding  (and  prior  to  PD)  iii)  randomized  to  placebo  and  not 
treated with lenalidomide (prior to PD) iv) randomized to placebo and treated.

Secondary efficacy endpoint: Overall Survival 
As of the 1 March 2015 data cutoff date, the median follow-up time from randomization was, overall, 
72.4 months in the CALGB study. Between the date of unblinding (17 December 2009) and the data 
cutoff date for this submission (1 March 2015), the rate of death events overall increased from 8.0% 
to 39.3%.

As of the 01 February 2016 data cutoff date, the PFS2 analysis indicates a 39% reduction in the risk of 
PD after starting second-line AMT, death, or starting a third-line AMT for subjects in the lenalidomide 
arm compared with those in the placebo arm (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.78). The improvement in 
median  PFS2  was  27.4  months  (80.2  months  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  versus  52.8  months  in  the 
placebo arm).

Following confirmation of inclusion criteria and within 6 months after ASCT, patients were randomised 
to receive in maintenance phase continuous daily orally placebo or lenalidomide 10 mg/day for 28 days 
per 28-day cycle. For patients showing good tolerance to maintenance therapy, the dose of 
lenalidomide could be increased to 15 mg/day. Prior to starting maintenance treatment, the patients 
were also to receive 2 cycles of consolidation treatment with lenalidomide (25 mg/day for 21 
consecutive days of a 28-day cycle).

a Free choice, but the recommendation was to include subject in IFM 2005-01 protocol. IFM 2005-01 Arm A1 = VAD 
(4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles); IFM 2005-01 Arm A2 = VAD (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles); IFM 
2005-01 Arm B1 = bortezomib and dexamethasone (4 cycles); IFM 2005-01 Arm B2 = bortezomib and 
dexamethasone (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles). 
b A second ASCT was recommended if response to first transplant was not VGPR or better. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  a  maintenance  treatment  with 
lenalidomide following autologous stem cell transplantation in extending post-transplantation PFS. 
Secondary objectives were to assess progression free survival (PFS) from the date of diagnosis, overall 
survival  (OS),  time  to  progression  (TTP),  response  assessment  and  safety  of  lenalidomide  in  post-
transplantation consolidation and maintenance treatment chemotherapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  PFS  (defined  as  the  period  from  randomization  to  the  date  of 
progression or death whatever the cause). 
Secondary endpoints were: 
• 
PFS  from  diagnosis  calculated  for  all  patients  from  the  date  of  diagnosis  to  the  date  of 
progression or death (whatever the cause).  
•  OS calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death.  
•  Response  duration  calculated  for  all  randomised  patients  with  a  complete  or  partial  response 
from the date of randomisation to the date of progression.  
•  Complete  response  duration  calculated  for  all  randomised  patients  with  a  complete  response 
from the date that complete response criteria were first met to the date of progression.  
• 
• 
TTP calculated for all patients from the date of randomisation to the date of progression.  
Time to the best response calculated for all patients from the date of randomisation to the date 
of the best response.

Sample size 
For  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  PFS,  sample  size  calculation  were  based  on  the  assumption  that  a 
42%  improvement  in  median  time  to  progression  from  37.5%  at  4  years  after  randomisation  for 
placebo  to  50%  at  4  years  for  lenalidomide  was  to  be  considered  clinically  relevant.  The  initial 
calculation evaluated that approximately 267 subjects in each treatment group would have 90% power 
to  detect  the  difference  in  2  survivorship  functions  with  a  hazard  rate  ratio  of  1.42  (placebo  arm  vs. 
lenalidomide arm) using a one-sided log rank test with overall significance level of 0.05 (adjusted for 4 
interim analyses). Expecting a drop out rate of 15%, 614 subjects were to be enrolled. Full information 
necessary for a log-rank test to have 90% power would be achieved when approximately 300 subjects 
had progressed or died (PFS). 
Approximately  614  subjects  would  also  have  85%  power  to  detect  the  difference  in  2  survivorship 
functions  with  a  hazard  rate  ratio  of  1.42  (placebo  arm  vs.  lenalidomide  arm)  using  a  one-sided 
logrank  test  with  overall  significance  level  of  0.025  (adjusted  for  one  interim  analysis)  with  a  final 
alpha  equal  to  2.4%.  Full  information  necessary  for  a  log-rank  test  to  have  85%  power  would  be 
achieved when approximately 300 subjects had progressed or died (PFS). 
Randomisation 
After transplantation, patients were randomised (1:1) to lenalidomide arm or placebo arm.  
Randomisation  was  stratified  based  on  3  parameters:  beta2-microglobulin  at  diagnosis  (≤  or  >  3 
mg/l), chromosome 13 deletion (present or absent) and response after transplant (CR; VGPR /PR;SD).  
Initial stratification also comprised the number of transplants (one or two). The amendment number 4 
modified  this  stratum  which  became  response  after  transplant.  The  number  of  subjects  randomized 
before the amendment 4 was 312. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blind study until amendment 8.  
Statistical methods 
This study was designed to have 1 interim analysis performed after 60% of events (progression and/or 
deaths) had been observed. An independent DMC evaluated safety and efficacy data at the time of the 
interim  analysis.  Upper  and  lower  bounds  based  on  O’Brien-Fleming  stopping  rules  were  used  in  the 
interim  efficacy  analysis.  The  primary  efficacy  variable  PFS,  was  compared  between  arms  using  a 
group  sequential  log-rank  test  corresponding  to  2  analyses  one  interim  at  60%  information  and  one 
final at 100% information. The upper boundary for superiority of lenalidomide over placebo was based 
on an α spending function of the O’Brien-Fleming type with overall one-sided α=0.025. If at the interim 
analysis  (at  60%),  a  log  rank  statistic  is  above  the  upper  boundary,  a  recommendation  to  stop  the 
study and claim superiority for the lenalidomide to be considered. 
Definition of Analysis Sets 
Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  were  randomized, independently 
of  whether  they  received  study  treatment  or  not.  Patients  were  analysed  according  to  the  treatment 
they were randomized to receive and not according to what they actually received, if different. 
Assessment report

Treated Population/Safety Population 
The  treated  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the 
study  treatment  (either  lenalidomide  or  placebo).  Patients  were  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment 
they were randomized to receive and not according to what they actually received, if different. 
Per-Protocol Population (PP) 
Per-protocol  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  subjects  who  met  eligibility  criteria,  who 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment  and  who  had  at  least  1  valid  post-baseline  response 
assessment without any major protocol violation. Patients were to be analysed according to the initial 
treatment they actually received. 
Consolidation population 
The  consolidation  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
the  study  treatment  (lenalidomide) during  the  consolidation  period.  Patients  were  analyzed  according 
to the treatment they were randomized to receive and not according to what they actually received, if 
different.  
Maintenance population  
The  maintenance  population  was  defined  as  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
the  study  treatment  (either  lenalidomide  or  placebo)  during  the  maintenance  period.  It  included  all 
patients in the consolidation population who continued the treatment in the maintenance period and all 
patients without consolidation period who began the treatment with a maintenance treatment.  
Efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  ITT  population  and  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the 
treated population.

Results 
Participant flow 
a) 1 patient randomized just before Amendment #2 approval asked to receive the consolidation 
treatment at the time the amendment was approved 
b) 1 patient did not receive any treatment due to grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
c) 1 patient randomized after Amendment #2 approval did not receive the consolidation treatment due 
to elapsed time between the date of approval and the date of written receipt of the approval 
d) 5 patients did not receive any treatment: three patients for disease progression and two patients for 
consent withdrawal 
Recruitment 
The study started on 12 June 2006 and the last patient was enrolled in 29 August 2008. The last dose 
of lenalidomide maintenance treatment was administered on March 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
Twelve amendments to the study protocol were made. Significant protocol changes are outlined below: 
•  Amendment 2, dated 4 October 2006, included a post-transplant consolidation step. Under this 
amendment, all patients were to receive 2 cycles of consolidation therapy with lenalidomide 25 
mg/day for 21 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle, prior to starting maintenance treatment in 
the arm to which they were randomized.

•  Amendment  4,  dated  20  August  2007,  stratified  the  randomization  by  “post-transplantation 
response” rather than “number of transplantations”. 
•  Amendment  7,  dated  24  August  2009,  planned  an  interim  analysis  of  efficacy  when  60% 
information  fraction  had  been  reached  (60%  of  events  required  for  primary  PFS  analysis).  If 
the  p-value  from  the  logrank  test  was  less  than  0.004,  then  the  independent  DMC  could 
consider stopping and/or unblinding the study and declaring the lenalidomide arm superior. 
•  Amendment  8,  dated  26  August  2010,  added  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC) 
recommendation  to  unblind  the  study,  following  the  results  of  a  pre-planned  interim  analysis 
(September  2009  dataset)  that  showed  significant  benefit  in  the  lenalidomide  arm.  First 
unblinding  occurred on 7 July  2010; patients  in the  placebo group were  recommended to  not 
cross over to lenalidomide treatment; 
•  Amendment 9, dated 21 March 2011, added the decision to stop treatment for all patients still 
on  therapy  after  reports  showed  a  higher level  of  second  primary  malignancies  (SPMs)  in  the 
lenalidomide arm; 
•  Amendment  12,  dated  18  December  2014,  extended  the  duration  of  the  study  of  a  further  3 
years (up to December 2017) in order to evaluate precisely the risk of second cancers.

Supportive study 
GINEMA study 
Study  GIMEMA  was  a  Phase  3,  multicenter,  open-label,  2 × 2 factorial,  controlled  study  conducted  by 
Fondazione  Neoplasie  Sangue  Onlus  (FO.NE.SA  Onlus),  an  independent  Italian  cooperative  group,  in 
the first-line setting of transplant-eligible NDMM. The primary objective of the study was to determine 
(after  induction  treatment  with  a  standard  lenalidomide-dexamethasone  regimen)  the  efficacy  and 
safety of MPR (Melphalan-Prednisone-Lenalidomide) versus High Dose Melphalan (MEL200: melphalan 
200 mg/m2) followed by ASCT in NDMM subjects in extending PFS, the primary endpoint.  
Overall,  subjects  were  randomized  (1:1:1:1  ratio)  at  enrollment  and  prior  to  induction  into  1  of 
4 groups: 
ASCT  versus  intensified  induction:  Arm  A  (MPR)  or  Arm B  (2 courses  of  HDM  [MEL200]  and  ASCT 
unless at least VGPR was achieved after 1 course).  
Maintenance:  Arms A1  (no  maintenance)  and  A2  (maintenance  with  lenalidomide),  Arms  B1  (no 
maintenance) and B2 (maintenance with lenalidomide).

of  10  mg/day  or  no  maintenance  treatment.  Subjects  continued  to  receive  maintenance  treatment 
until PD or development of unacceptable adverse effects. 
The primary comparison was between HDM/ASCT and MPR (Arms B and A, respectively). A total of 402 
subjects  were  registered  in  the  study  between  November  2007  and  July  2009  at 62 centers  in  Italy 
and Israel . Of the 402 subjects, 399 entered the common induction/mobilization phase (4 courses of 
Rd), and 273 remained eligible for random assignment to receive intensified induction with HDM/ASCT 
or MPR (Arms B versus A). At the end of intensified induction, 251 subjects also were eligible for the 
randomized  comparison  between  maintenance  and  no  maintenance  (Arms  2  versus  1),  but  only 
231 subjects received treatment/no treatment. 
Efficacy results (Data cut-off Date: 30 April 2013) 
The median duration of follow-up from the time of enrollment was 51.2 months.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical data package for the new indication consists of 2 pivotal studies: CALGB 100104 and IFM 
2005-02. The design of both studies had some substantial differences in term of patient management. 
IFM 2005-02 study was performed in an EU population and included a consolidation and a maintenance 
phase while CALGB 100104 was performed exclusively in US patients with only a maintenance phase. 
Consolidation is not a standard of care approach to myeloma therapy. There is no approved drug in 
this particular setting. The administration of a higher dose of lenalidomide over a few weeks to achieve 
further reduction in myeloma tumour burden is debatable. Based on this, the indication was restricted 
to maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have

undergone autologous stem cell transplantation 
In study CALGB 100104, the DSMB, after reviewing the interim analysis results, requested an updated 
analysis. The updated analysis was reviewed by the DSMB and included an estimated 28% of the 
expected number of events at a data cut-off date of 9 September 2009. The DSMB found that the 
study demonstrated a significantly longer PFS following ASCT for those subjects receiving lenalidomide 
than those receiving placebo. This led to the release of the results on 17 December 2009. Treatment 
assignments were unblinded on 17 December 2009 and the randomization was stopped. 
In IFM 2005-02 study treatment assignments were unblinded on 7 July 2010 and the randomization 
was stopped. Those subjects who were unblinded and determined to be on lenalidomide, continued on 
maintenance therapy with lenalidomide until progression as planned. For subjects who were receiving 
placebo at the time of unblinding, it was recommended by the DSMB that the placebo therapy be 
stopped (cross over before PD not recommended). 
After observing an imbalance of SPMs in the lenalidomide arm, a safety measure was initiated on 26 
January 2011, which provided for the immediate treatment discontinuation of patients in the 
lenalidomide arm who were still receiving study maintenance treatment at that time. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
CALGB 100104 
At the time of unblinding, CALGB 100104 has provided convincing evidence of efficacy of lenalidomide 
with  a  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint  PFS, 
compared to placebo. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 62% (HR=0.38, 95% 
CI [0.27 to 0.54]; log-rank p value < 0.001).   
The  finding  of  interim  analysis  was  supported by  the  updated  analyses:  at the  March  2015  data  cut-
off, the risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 42% (HR=0.58; 95% CI [0.46 to 0.73]; 
log-rank p value < 0.001); at the February 2016 data cut-off, the risk of disease progression or death 
was reduced by 39% (HR= 0.61, 95% CI [0.48 to 0.76]; log-rank p value < 0.001). 
Overall survival data was still immature at the time of the interim analysis. In the updated analysis (1 
March  2015  data  cut-off  date)  the  median  OS  was  not  reached  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  however  the 
HR  remained  statistically  significant,  in  favour  of  the  lenalidomide  arm  (HR=0.57;  95%  CI  [0.42  to 
0.76]; log-rank p value < 0.001). In the second updated analysis (1 February 2016 data cut-off date) 
the median OS for lenalidomide treatment was 111.0 months compared with 84.2 months for placebo 
treatment and this survival advantage of 26.8 months was statistically significant (HR=0.61; 95% CI 
[0.46 to 0.81]; log-rank p value < 0.001). 
PFS2 analysis demonstrated an HR of 0.61 (95% CI [0.46 to 0.81] log-rank p value < 0.001) in favour 
of lenalidomide arm, confirming the benefit of the maintenance therapy. 
Study IFM 2005-002 
The primary endpoint, PFS, showed a  highly significant HR of 0.45 (0.34 to 0.60, log-rank p value < 
0.001). The median PFS was 23 months in the placebo arm while not reached in the lenalidomide arm. 
The updated analyses support the interim analysis: at the March 2015 data cut-off, the risk of disease 
progression  or  death  was  reduced  by  45%  (HR=0.55;  95%  CI  [0.46  to  0.66];  log-rank  p  value  < 
0.001);  at  the  February  2016  data  cut-off,  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  was  reduced  by 
43% (HR= 0.57, 95% CI [0.47 to 0.68]; log-rank p value < 0.001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/108277/2017  
Page 53/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional analysis of PFS was conducted in the ITT population restricted to 573 patients who received 
maintenance treatment, i.e., excluding patients who entered the consolidation phase of the study but 
were discontinued from treatment before beginning maintenance treatment. According to this analysis 
in maintenance population (cut-off date of 1 March  2015), the estimated PFS HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 
0.44  to  0.65).  Median  PFS  was  24.1  months  (95%  CI:  21.3  to  27.5)  in  the  placebo  arm  and  46.9 
months (95% CI: 40.8 to 55.1) in the lenalidomide arm. 
Overall survival was not mature at the time of the interim analysis (4 September 2009). Based on the 
updated data set (1 February 2016) the HR remained not statistically significant (p=0.355). However 
this was not associated with any negative trend. 
The  PFS2  analysis  demonstrated  an  HR  of  0.80  (95%  CI,  0.66  to  0.98)  in  favor  of  lenalidomide 
maintenance,  resulting  in  an  improvement  of  11.5  months  in  the  KM  median  for  PFS2  (69.9  versus 
58.4 months in the lenalidomide and placebo arms, respectively). 
Study GIMEMA 
In  study  GIMEMA,  the  subgroup  analysis  showed  a  significantly  longer  PFS  following  ASCT  for  those 
subjects  receiving  lenalidomide  than  those  receiving  placebo  (HR=  0.42;  95%  CI  [0.24  to  0.73]). 
However, the HR of OS was not statistically significant (HR = 0.62; 95% CI [0.21-1.59]). 
Efficacy  results,  although  potentially  in  favour  of  Revlimid,  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  since 
the  study  was  not powered  for  any  comparison  between  maintenance  and  no  maintenance  (Arms  B2 
and B1, respectively). Therefore, it is believed that no significant conclusion could be drawn from such 
data.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study CALGB 100104 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of lenalidomide in terms of 
the primary endpoint PFS, compared to placebo in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. This was supported by a statistical 
significant survival benefit in favour of lenalidomide. 
In study IFM 2005-002, lenalidomide maintenance resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS and secondary endpoint PFS2 compared to 
placebo.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evaluation of safety in maintenance therapy post ASCT in TE NDMM patients was primarily based 
on data from studies CALGB 100104 (“CALGB” study) and IFM 2005-02 ( “IFM” study), which started 
in  2005  and  2006,  respectively.  In  both  CALGB  and  IFM  studies,  TE  NDMM  subjects  received  local 
standard  of  induction  and  HDM/ASCT  (High  Dose  Melphalan/  Autologous  stem-cell  transplantation) 
therapy followed by protocol-specified maintenance therapy until disease progression.  
Assessment report

In  addition,  results  were  supported  with  data  taken  from  MM-15  Study,  in  non-transplant  eligible 
patients. 
The  analyses  of  AEs  generally  focused  on  TEAEs  during  maintenance  treatment,  defined  as  any  AEs 
that occurred/worsened on or after the first dose of maintenance study drug and within 30 days after 
the last dose (as defined in the CALGB and IFM). 
Patient exposure 
In CALGB and IFM studies, the maintenance safety population included all subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of Lenalidomide or placebo in the maintenance phase.

CALGB:  Review of the first planned interim analysis by the DSMB in June 2009 and then with a data 
cut-off on 09 Sep 2009 led to early unblinding of the results on 17 Dec 2009. Based on their review of 
data,  the  DSMB  noted  that  the  analysis  demonstrated  a  significantly  longer  time  to  progression  or 
death  following  ASCT  (ie,  the  primary  endpoint)  in  subjects  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  versus  placebo. 
After  unblinding,  this  study  continued,  with  ongoing  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  (who  had  not  yet 
progressed)  being  given  the  option  to  crossover  to  lenalidomide  maintenance  therapy.  Ongoing 
subjects in the Lenalidomide arm could continue their maintenance treatment. 
Upon  study  unblinding  (17  Dec  2009),  121  subjects  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  continued  protocol 
maintenance therapy and 76 subjects in the placebo arm who had not yet progressed crossed over to 
receive lenalidomide maintenance treatment. To be noted, as of the 01 Mar 2015 data cutoff date, 48 
subjects in the lenalidomide arm and 19 subjects in the placebo arm (who had crossed over to receive 
lenalidomide) are still receiving maintenance therapy. 
In  placebo  subjects,  TEAEs  recorded  after  crossover  to  lenalidomide  were  excluded  from  the  SCS 
analyses, except second primary malignancies, which are presented regardless of crossover. 
In  the  CALGB  study,  the  initial  planned  maintenance  dose  of  10mg  lenalidomide  QD  was  to  be 
increased  to  15  mg  QD  (3  capsules  per  day)  according  to  study  design  after  3  months,  provided  the 
absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  was  ≥  1000/mcL  and  platelet  count  ≥  75,000/mcL  and  all  non-
hematologic toxicity was ≤ Grade 1 . The placebo arm followed the same dosing schedule as the R10 
arm, including the potential increase to 3 capsules daily. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/108277/2017  
Page 55/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  IFM  study,  patients  who  met  all  eligibility  criteria  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  1  of  2  treatment 
arms but they all first received 2 cycles of consolidation treatment with lenalidomide 25 mg/day for 21 
consecutive  days  of  a  28-day  cycle,  followed  by  single-agent  lenalidomide  10  mg/day  28/28  days  or 
placebo  maintenance  therapy.  TEAEs  recorded  during  the  2 cycles  of  consolidation  lenalidomide 
therapy prior to maintenance (amendment 2) were  excluded from the SCS analyses in both R10 and 
placebo subjects, with the exception of SPM analyses. 
In the IFM study, if there were no signs of toxicity, the initial maintenance dose of 10 mg lenalidomide 
QD was to be increased to 15 mg QD according to study design after 3 months of maintenance. The 
placebo arm followed the same dosing schedule as the R10 arm, including the potential to increase the 
number of capsules.

Overall,  Grade 5  TEAEs  were  reported  in  3  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  CALGB  lenalidomide  arm  and  4 
(1.8%) subjects in the CALGB placebo arm.

The Grade 5 TEAEs reported in the CALGB lenalidomide arm included: sepsis (n = 2) and sudden death 
(n = 1). Of the 3 subjects in the CALGB lenalidomide arm who experienced Grade 5 TEAEs, 1 subject 
with  a  Grade  5  TEAE  of  sepsis  died  of  sepsis  on  treatment.  The  2  other  subjects  in  the  CALGB 
lenalidomide  arm  who  experienced  Grade  5  TEAEs  (sepsis  [n = 1]  and  sudden  death  [n = 1])  died 
more  than  30 days  after  the  last  dose;  therefore,  these  2  subjects  were  not  considered  to  have  on-
treatment deaths despite having a treatment-emergent Grade 5 event.  
In  the  CALGB  placebo  arm,  Grade  5  TEAEs  included:  multiple  myeloma  (n =2);  acute  respiratory 
distress syndrome (n = 1); atrioventricular block (n = 1); and sepsis (n = 1). Of the 4 subjects in the 
CALGB  placebo  arm  who  experienced  Grade  5  TEAEs,  3  subjects  died  on  treatment.  These  CALGB 
placebo  subjects  who  died  on  treatment  included:  1  subject  with  Grade  5  TEAEs  of  atrioventricular 
block and sepsis who died of sepsis; 1 subject with a Grade 5 TEAE of multiple myeloma who died of 
multiple myeloma; and 1 subject with a Grade 5 TEAE of acute respiratory distress syndrome who died 
of  H1N1  influenza.  The  other  subject  in  the  CALGB  placebo  arm  who  experienced  a  Grade  5  TEAE 
(multiple  myeloma)  died  more  than  30  days  after  the  last  dose;  therefore,  this  subject  was  not 
considered to have an on-treatment death despite having a treatment-emergent Grade 5 event. 
Overall, Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in 7 (2.4%) subjects in the IFM lenalidomide arm and 2 (0.7%) 
subjects  in  the  IFM  placebo  arm.  The  SOC  with  the  most  subjects  who  experienced  a  Grade 5  TEAE 
was  the  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified  (including  cysts  and  polyps)  SOC  (4 [1.4%] 
subjects in the IFM lenalidomide arm). 
The  Grade  5  TEAEs  reported  in  the  IFM  lenalidomide  arm  included:  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (n = 1); 
colon  cancer  metastatic  (n = 1);  esophageal  carcinoma  (n = 1);  ischemia  (n = 1),  myelodysplastic 
syndrome  (n = 1);  staphylococcal  sepsis  (n = 1);  and  sudden  death  (n =1).  Of  the  7  subjects  in  the 
IFM lenalidomide arm who experienced Grade 5 TEAEs, 4 subjects died between the first dose and 30 
days  after  the  last  dose  of  maintenance  treatment.  The  Grade 5  TEAEs  reported  for  these  4  IFM 
lenalidomide subjects included: 1 subject with acute myeloid leukemia; 1 subject with ischemia (acute 
mesenteric  and  colonic  ischemia);  1  subject  with  staphylococcal  sepsis;  and  1  subject  with  sudden 
death.  The  3  other  IFM  lenalidomide  subjects  who  experienced  a  Grade  5  TEAEs  died  more  than  30 
days  after  the  last  dose. The  Grade 5  TEAEs  reported  (days  from  last  dose to  death)  for these 3  IFM 
lenalidomide  subjects  included:  1  subject  with  colon  cancer  metastatic  (227  days);  1  subject  with 
esophageal carcinoma (325 days); and 1 subject with myelodysplastic syndrome (544 days). 
The Grade 5 TEAEs reported in the IFM placebo arm included: renal failure (n =1); road traffic accident 
(n = 1); and staphylococcal infection (n = 1). The 2 subjects in the IFM placebo arm who experienced 
Grade 5 TEAEs died between the first dose and 30 days after the last dose of maintenance treatment.  
The  Grade 5  TEAEs  reported  for  these  2  IFM  placebo  subjects  included:  1  subject  with  a  road  traffic 
accident and 1 subject with a staphylococcal infection and renal failure.  
Second Primary Malignancies  
In  late  2010,  a  safety  concern  arose  with  regard  to  SPMs  based  on  the  emerging  results  of  3 
prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled lenalidomide studies in subjects with NDMM 
(Studies MM-015, IFM 2005-02, and CALGB 100104) leading to an evaluation of SPMs across the entire 
MAH’s lenalidomide safety database, including all investigational indications. 
Two cohort studies of SPMs after ASCT for multiple myeloma have been reported. The first analysis is a 
retrospective cohort study of 841 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma who underwent ASCT at 
City of Hope between 1989 and 2009 (Krishnan, 2013). The cumulative incidences of SPMs were 7.4% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/108277/2017  
Page 67/99 
 
 
 
 
 
at  5  years  and  15.9%  at  10  years.  Older  age  (≥  55  years)  and  race  (non-Hispanic  white)  were 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  SPMs  by  multivariate  analysis.  The  risk  for  SPMs  in  patients 
receiving lenalidomide could not be assessed because too few patients in this population were treated 
with  lenalidomide.  A  second  cohort  analysis  studied  patients  who  received  a  first  ASCT  within  18 
months of diagnosis of multiple myeloma and were reported to the Center for International Blood and 
Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). This study included 4161 patients receiving an ASCT for 
multiple myeloma in the US from 1990 to 2010 (Mahindra, 2015). Post-ASCT maintenance therapy in 
this  population  included  thalidomide  (15%),  lenalidomide  (11%),  bortezomib  (9%),  and  interferon 
(6%).  The  cumulative  incidences  of  SPMs  were  2.6%,  4.2%,  and  6.1%  at  3,  5,  and  7  years, 
respectively.  The  incidence  rate  of  SPMs  was  1.2  new  cancers  per  100  person-years.  Obesity,  older 
age, and male gender were associated with increased risks of SPMs in multivariate analyses. 
CALGB 100104 
As of the data cut-off date of 1 February 2016 for Study CALGB 100104, the median follow-up time for 
surviving subjects was 81.6 months (range: 3.4 to 119,8 months). SPM analysis was split into invasive 
and non-invasive SPM. Invasive SPM include hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.

Subjects with SPM in the placebo arm: Following study unblinding on 17 Dec 2009, a total of 76 of 
the  221  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  had  crossed  over  to  receive  lenalidomide  treatment  prior  to 
disease  progression.  As  of  cut-off  date  on  1  March  2016,  85  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  received 
lenalidomide  salvage  therapy  after  disease  progression.  Only  60  of  the  221  subjects  who  were 
randomized  and  received  placebo  maintenance  were  not  exposed  to  lenalidomide  post-ASCT  prior  to 
(crossover) or after (salvage) progressive disease. Among the 76 placebo subjects who crossed over to 
lenalidomide treatment prior to disease progression, 12 subjects were diagnosed with an SPM after the 
start of lenalidomide therapy, including 9 patients with invasive SPM.  Among the 85 placebo subjects 
who received lenalidomide salvage therapy after disease progression, 8 subjects were diagnosed with 
SPM  after  the  start  of  lenalidomide  salvage  therapy.    Among  the  60  placebo  subjects  who  were  not 
exposed to lenalidomide post-ASCT during this study, 1 subject developed a solid tumor SPM (carcinoid 
tumor pulmonary).

d Two subjects were diagnosed with invasive SPMs (solid tumor SPMs) prior to receiving lenalidomide-containing 
salvage therapy; One subject was diagnosed with 2 solid tumor SPMs (endometrial cancer stage II and ovarian 
cancer) and one subject  was diagnosed with lentigo maligna.  These 2 subjects received lenalidomide-containing 
salvage therapy; however, their solid tumor SPMs were diagnosed during placebo maintenance and thus, these 
solid tumor SPMs are not included in the “lenalidomide exposed group.” Data cutoff date= 1 March 2015.

-  Hematologic:  Globally,  23  cases  of  hematologic  malignancies  were  observed  in  CALGB  study, 
exclusively in the lenalidomide exposed arm: 
o  AML/MDS: Among these 23 cases of hematologic malignancies, 15 were AML/MDS SPMs. 
o  B-cell  malignancies:  Among  these  23  cases  of  hematologic  malignancies,  7  were  B-cell 
malignancies.  
-  Solid tumors: As of the 1 March 2015 data cutoff date, a total of 25  subjects were diagnosed 
with  solid  tumor  SPMs;  24  subjects  in  the  lenalidomide  exposed  arm  and  1  subject  in  the  no 
lenalidomide exposure arm.  
IFM 2005-02

Consistent with the frequencies of subjects with SPMs, the incidence rates of invasive, hematologic, 
and solid tumor SPMs were higher for the lenalidomide arm compared with the placebo arm. The 
incidence rates of developing an invasive SPM were 2.51 and 1.59 per 100 person-years in the 
lenalidomide and placebo arms, respectively. 
Subjects with SPM in the placebo arm  
Globally, 27 of the 302 patients in the placebo arm presented with SPM, including 22 (7.3%) invasive 
SPM. Among these, 13(4.3) were solid tumors and 9 (3%) were hematologic malignancies. Of the 103 
placebo  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  who  received  lenalidomide  salvage  treatment,  7  subjects  were 
diagnosed with an invasive SPM (3 hematologic and 4 solid tumor SPMs) after the start of lenalidomide 
salvage therapy. In addition, 2 subjects were diagnosed with a non-melanoma skin cancer prior to the 
start of lenalidomide salvage therapy. Of the 199 subjects in the placebo arm who were not exposed to 
lenalidomide  after  consolidation,  13  subjects  developed  an invasive  SPM  (6  hematologic  malignancies 
and 7 solid tumors) and 3 subjects developed a non-melanoma skin cancer.

Analysis of SPM in lenalidomide exposed versus non-exposed patients (1 March 2015) 
For  Study  IFM  2005-02,  the  number  of  subjects  with  invasive  SPMs  was  higher  for  the  lenalidomide 
exposed  population  compared  with  the  lenalidomide  non-exposed  population  (61  [10.3%]  versus  2 
[14.3%],  respectively).    The  number  of  person-years  of  observation  time  was  much  greater  (43.48-
fold) for the lenalidomide exposed population compared with the lenalidomide non-exposed population 
(3164.71  versus  72.78  person-years,  respectively),  since  only  a  small  minority  of  subjects  did  not 
receive lenalidomide consolidation treatment.  A total of 2 subjects developed hematologic SPMs (AML 
and MDS [1 subject each]) among the small number of lenalidomide non-exposed subjects, resulting 
in an IR for invasive SPMs of 2.75 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.69, 10.99) compared with an IR of 
1.93  per  100  person-years  (95%  CI  1.50,  2.48)  in  subjects  exposed  to  lenalidomide;  however,  the 
95% CIs of the respective IRs overlap.

Studies CALGB100104 and IFM 2005-02 pooled data 
A  total  of  156  (14.8%)  of  the  1053  subjects  in  the  pooled  Studies  CALGB  100104  and  IFM  2005-02 
experienced  at  least 1  SPM  as  of  the  01  Feb  2016 data  cutoff  date.    Of  these,  a  higher  frequency  of 
subjects  with  SPMs  was  observed  in  the  pooled  lenalidomide  arm  compared  with  the  pooled  placebo 
arm (97 [18.3%] versus 59 [11.3%], respectively). 
The  frequency  of  subjects  with  invasive  SPMs  (hematologic  and  solid  tumor  SPMs)  was  higher  in  the 
pooled  lenalidomide  arm  compared  with  the  pooled  placebo  arm  (79  [14.9%]  versus  46  [8.8%], 
respectively).  Of those with invasive SPMs, 40 (7.5%) of the 57 subjects with hematologic SPMs were 
in  the  pooled  lenalidomide  arm,  while  17  (3.3%)  subjects  were  in  the  pooled  placebo  arm.    The 
frequency of subjects with solid tumor SPMs was also higher in the pooled lenalidomide arm compared 
with  the  pooled  placebo  arm  (41  [7.7%]  versus  30  [5.7%],  respectively).    The  incidence  rate  of 
hematologic  malignancies,  most  notably  AML,  MDS  and  B-cell  malignancies  (including  Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 per 100 person-years 
for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 
0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT). The incidence rate of 
solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 1.05 per 100 person-
years  for  the  placebo  arms  (1.26  per  100  person-years  for  patients  exposed  to  lenalidomide  after 
ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT). 
The  incidence  rates  of  developing  a  non-melanoma  skin  cancer  were  similar  for  the  pooled 
lenalidomide and pooled placebo arms (0.72 versus 0.59 per 100 person-years, respectively).

Deaths  
Due  to  differences  in  the data  collected  for  cause  of  death between  the  IFM  study  (death  categories) 
and  the  CALGB  study  (verbatim  terms),  a  comparison  of  cause  of  death  by  frequency  of  PTs  is  not 
possible.  On-treatment  deaths  are  defined  as  deaths  occurring  between  the  first  dose  and  30  days 
after the last dose of maintenance treatment.

a  The starting lenalidomide maintenance dose (R 10 mg QD 28/28) could be raised to 15 mg QD (28/28), according 
to the study design. 
b  In Study CALGB 100104, data were excluded for placebo subjects crossing over to lenalidomide after the 
unblinding of the study.  
c  In Study IFM 2005-02, data were excluded from all subjects for the 2 cycles of lenalidomide consolidation (R 
25 mg QD 21/28). 
Laboratory findings 
In  CALGB  study,  changes  from  baseline  for  any  of  the  parameters  examined  were  small  in  both 
treatment arms, with no consistent pattern suggesting any differences.  
In IFM study, the frequency of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 WBC levels was higher in the lenalidomide 
arm  than  in  the  placebo  arm  (44.1%  versus  9.6%),  although  the  frequency  of  Grade  4  events  was 
comparable  between  the  two  arms  (2.0%  and  1.3%,  respectively).  It  follows  that  the  frequency  of 
subjects  with  Grade  3  or  4  neutrophils  levels  was  also  higher  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  than  in  the 
placebo  arm  (71.9%  versus  28.8%).  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  Grade 3  or  4  thrombocytopenia 
was higher in the lenalidomide than the placebo arm (15.0% versus 8.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/108277/2017 
Page 84/99 
 
 
  
The  number  of  subjects  with  elevated  total  bilirubin,  AP,  GGT  levels  was  slightly  higher  (>5%)  in 
lenalidomide group. The same for ALT and AST levels (≥ 10%) 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
In each age subgroup (Age Subgroup < 65years or ≥ 65 years; and Age Subgroup < 60 years or ≥ 60 
years),  the  difference  in  the  lenalidomide  safety  profile  between  the  2  studies  is  generally  consistent 
with the overall safety profile.  
Renal impairment  
In both studies, subjects were included with adequate renal function pre-ASCT (exclusion criteria: CrCl 
<  40  mL/min  (before  ASCT)  in  CALGB  study  and  history  of  renal  disorder  not  related  to  the  disease 
and defined by serum creatinine > 160 μmol in IFM).  
In each subgroup (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min or ≥ 50 mL/min), the lenalidomide safety profile 
in both studies was generally consistent with the overall safety profile.  
Hepatic impairment  
Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
N/A. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events  
Overall,  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the 
lenalidomide  pool  than  the  placebo  pool  (27.9%  versus  6.8%,  respectively).  With  the  exception  of 
neutropenia (2.3%), the frequencies of individual TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were 
low (< 2%) in the lenalidomide pool.

The starting lenalidomide maintenance dose (R 10 mg QD 28/28) could be raised to 15 mg QD 
(28/28), according to the study design. 
b  In Study CALGB 100104, for placebo subjects, only AEs up to crossing over to lenalidomide are included. 
c  N = 145 is for placebo subjects in CALGB who did not cross over prior to PD upon study unblinding. 
d  In Study IFM 2005-02, data were excluded from all subjects for the 2 cycles of lenalidomide consolidation (R 
25 mg QD 21/28).  
e  This term corresponds to a preprinted CTCAE term or prompt on the CRF of Study CALGB 100104. 
f  Due to CRF layout in CALGB, specific AEs that led to treatment discontinuation were not collected. Subjects with 
“AE,” “other disease,” or “other, specify” as the reason for treatment discontinuation were retrospectively queried 
for a specific adverse event term that may have led to discontinuation. For those subjects with terms not 
provided, PT of “adverse event” was utilized. 
Note: System organ classes and preferred terms are coded using MedDRA Version 15.1 and are listed

Data cutoff: 1 March 2015 
Post marketing experience 
During the most recent PSUR reporting interval, 2 safety signals were identified from the literature 
(Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] reactivation and serious hypocalcemia), and 1 was identified from a health 
authority (pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage [PAH]). Safety topic reviews were completed for all 3 
signals. For EBV reactivation and PAH, no changes to the reference safety information were required. 
Serious hypocalcemia is a listed event in the Revlimid Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS); no additional 
labeling was warranted. PAH remain under close monitoring. 
In addition, an in-depth analysis of peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with lenalidomide was 
performed in response to the PRAC recommendation adopted on 09 Jul 2015 for the lenalidomide PSUR 
11 ( covering 27 Dec 2013 to 26 Dec 2014). The MAH was requested to discuss whether peripheral 
neuropathy remains an important potential risk for lenalidomide, or, if considering MDS and NDMM 
studies, this risk should be considered as an identified risk in the EU RMP. This review was provided in 
the next PSUR 12 (covering 27 Dec 2014 to 26 Dec 2015). Overall, the analysis of peripheral 
neuropathy has confirmed the established safety profile of lenalidomide and the status of this 
important potential risk remained unchanged. 
During the assessment of the previous PSUR 11, the MAH had planned to update the EU SmPC for 
Revlimid to align with the CCDS version 12 by including acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) after 
allogeneic hematopoietic transplant as a new ADR based on post-marketing/literature reports, which 
was a confirmed signal during the reporting period of PSUR 11. However, the PRAC did not agree to 
update the EU SmPC to include the ADR of aGvHD for the time being and recommended that the signal 
be kept ongoing and that evidence of off-label use of lenalidomide in this unapproved indication in EU 
be further investigated in the next PSUR. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety is primarily based on data from study CALGB 100104 and study IFM 2005-02. 
These  two  studies  randomized  1074  subjects;  1018 of those  subjects  started maintenance  treatment 
(517 subjects received lenalidomide and 501 subjects received placebo). As of the 1 March 2015 data 
cutoff date, lenalidomide treatment remains ongoing in the CALGB study for 67 subjects (48 from the 
lenalidomide arm and 19 who crossed over from the placebo arm), as well as long-term safety follow-
up  (including  follow-up  for  SPMs)  for  all  subjects.  Treatment  was  discontinued  in  the  IFM  study  in 
January 2011, but long-term follow-up for deaths and SPMs for all subjects remains ongoing.

The  serious  adverse  reactions  observed  more  frequently  (≥5%)  with  lenalidomide  maintenance  than 
placebo  were:  Pneumonias  (10.6%;  combined  term)  from  IFM  2005-02  and  Lung  infection  (9.4%) 
from CALGB 100104 (SmPC section 4.8). 
In  the  IFM  2005-02  study,  the  adverse  reactions  observed  more  frequently  with  lenalidomide 
maintenance  than  placebo  were  neutropenia  (60.8%),  bronchitis  (47.4%),  diarrhoea  (38.9%), 
nasopharyngitis  (34.8%),  muscle  spasms  (33.4%),  leucopenia  (31.7%),  asthenia  (29.7%),  cough 
(27.3%),  thrombocytopenia  (23.5%),  gastroenteritis  (22.5%)  and  pyrexia  (20.5%)  (SmPC  section 
4.8). 
In  the  CALGB  100104  study,  the  adverse  reactions  observed  more  frequently  with  lenalidomide 
maintenance than placebo were neutropenia (79.0%), thrombocytopenia (72.3%), diarrhoea (54.5%), 
rash  (31.7%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (26.8%),  fatigue  (22.8%),  leucopenia  (22.8%)  and 
anaemia (21.0%) (SmPC section 4.8). 
The observed TEAEs were mainly expected. In both studies, there were about twice more serious TEAE 
in  lenalidomide  arms  vs  placebo.  The  main  concerned  SOCs  with  SAE  were  “Blood  and  Lymphatic 
System Disorders” with 7.6% and 8.5 % in lenalidomide arms in CALGB and IFM study respectively, vs 
(1.8  %  and  1.4%)  in  placebo  arms  in  CALGB  and  IFM  study  respectively;  and  “infections  and 
infestations”  with  16.1%  and  13.7  %  in  lenalidomide  arms  in  CALGB  and  IFM  study  respectively,  vs 
(5.0 %  and  3.6%)  in  placebo  arms  in  CALGB  and  IFM  study  respectively.  Reported  serious infections 
were  mainly  respiratory  infections,  considering  the  main  reported  PT  Bronchitis,  Lung  infection  and 
Upper respiratory tract infection. It should also be noted that PT “lung disorders” reported in IFM study 
is related to infections (6.8% in lenalidomide arm). Similar trends in these serious TEAE are observed 
when  comparing  both  studies.  These  serious  TEAE  are  coherent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
lenalidomide. 
The  overall  frequency  of  subjects  with  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  during  CALGB  lenalidomide  maintenance 
was  70.1%  compared  with  75.1%  in  IFM  lenalidomide  during  maintenance.  The  most  commonly 
reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the CALGB lenalidomide arm were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
leukopenia  (> 15%  of  subjects each),  followed  by lymphopenia,  neutropenic  infection,  lung  infection, 
fatigue,  febrile  neutropenia,  diarrhea,  and  pneumonia  (>  5%  of  subjects  each).  The  most  commonly 
reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the IFM lenalidomide arm were neutropenia and leukopenia (> 15% of 
subjects each), followed by thrombocytopenia and lung disorder (> 5% of subjects each). 
Grade  5  TEAEs  were  reported  in  3  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  of  the  CALGB  study,  of 
which 2 of 3 subjects died > 30 days after last treatment, and in 7 (2.4%) subjects in the lenalidomide 
arm  of  the  IFM  study,  of  which  3  of  7  subjects  died  >  30  days  after  last  treatment  .  All  individual 
Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in < 1% of CALGB lenalidomide subjects and in ≤ 0.4% of IFM lenalidomide 
subjects. 
In  late  2010,  a  safety  concern  arose  with  regard  to  SPMs  based  on  the  emerging  results  of  3 
prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled lenalidomide studies in subjects with NDMM 
(Studies  MM-015,  IFM  2005-02,  and  CALGB  100104)  leading  to  an  evaluation  of  SPMs  across  the 
entire MAH lenalidomide safety database, including all investigational indications. 
Previous analyses of the CALGB and IFM studies (data cutoff of May 2013; median follow-up of 
surviving subjects of 46.7 and 60.9 months, respectively) showed that subjects treated with 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy post-HDM/ASCT had a statistically significant increased risk for 
hematologic SPMs,  and solid tumour SPMs (negative trend only) compared with subjects given 
placebo.  Based on safety data provided in studies IFM and CALGB (data cut-off of Feb 2016), a higher 
frequency of SPM was observed in patients in lenalidomide arm: CALGB: 20.5% versus 11.8%, 
respectively, and IFM: 16.7% versus 10.9%.   
Assessment report

Page 88/99 
 
 
  
To better characterize the potential risk increase of SPM associated with lenalidomide maintenance 
treatment, the MAH re-analysed the SPM results from both IFM and CALGB studies according to the 
lenalidomide exposure. PY was calculated as the time from the first dose date to the onset date of the 
first SPM for subjects with a SPM and the time from the first dose date to the date of last follow-up for 
subjects without an SPM. Duration of exposure was not taken into account in this calculation. IR also 
relied on the assumption that event rate per time unit is constant over time, e.g. that the risk is the 
same early and late after high dose therapy. This is less likely for, e.g. EBV associated Hodgkin. 
A small minority of subjects in Studies CALGB 100104 and IFM 2005-02 (N = 54) were never exposed 
to lenalidomide during these studies.  A total of 74 subjects were non-exposed to lenalidomide after 
ASCT. The pooled data included 979 subjects who were exposed to lenalidomide during 1 or more of 
the treatment phases of these studies.  Cross-over to lenalidomide whether prior to progression (after 
unblinding), after progression or as late salvage is not random driven but subject to investigator 
decision where time after ABMT is of relevance. Early progression after ABMT reflects poor prognosis 
and probably a more complex genotype and higher mutation burden. Higher mutation burden probably 
is reflected in a higher mutation burden in non-myeloma cells and a higher likelihood of SPM. As 
lenalidomide is non-mutagenic, but acts as a “facilitator” for SPM development, precise mechanisms to 
be defined, it is probably not possible to define the add-on risk of lenalidomide over time for SPM 
development in patients crossing-over. 
For the pooled CALGB and IFM studies, the frequency of subjects with invasive SPMs was higher for 
the lenalidomide exposed population compared with the lenalidomide non-exposed population (107 
[10.9%] versus 3 [5.6%], respectively).  
The increased risk of secondary primary malignancies associated with lenalidomide is relevant also in 
the context of NDMM after stem cell transplantation. Though this risk is not yet fully characterized, it 
should be kept in mind when considering and using Revlimid in this setting. 
The incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies 
(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 
per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to 
lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after 
ASCT). The incidence rate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide 
arms and 1.05 per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients 
exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to 
lenalidomide after ASCT) (SmPC section 4.4). 
Overall, grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance 
arms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in the 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide 
maintenance in NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (32.1% vs 26.7% in CALGB 100104 and 
16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs of neutropenia leading to 
lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 and 2.4% of patients 
in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the 
lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies (0.4% vs 
0.5% in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients should be advised to 
promptly report febrile episodes, a treatment interruption and/or dose reductions may be required 
(SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4,  4.8). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance 
arms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in 
NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (37.5% vs 30.3% in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in 
IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and

symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae and epistaxis, especially in patients receiving concomitant 
medicinal products susceptible to induce bleeding (SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety results for patients with NNMM treated with lenalidomide were in general consistent with the 
known safety profile of lenalidomide. The SmPC has been updated with the risk of increase of SPM 
associated with lenalidomide maintenance treatment. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple myeloma accounts for about 10% to 18% of hematologic malignancies. It is a disease of the 
elderly, with an overall median age at manifestation of approximately 70 years. The prognosis of 
patients with MM depends on a variety of factors at time of diagnosis. Induction therapy with 
subsequent HDM supported by ASCT is considered the standard for first-line treatment for young and 
fit MM patients. Despite improvements in therapeutic options and long-term outcome during the past 
years, most patients still experience disease relapse or have progressive disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Revlimid (lenalidomide) is already indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. Revlimid is also indicated in 
combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have 
received at least one prior therapy.  
No drug has currently been approved in the post-ASCT setting (TE NDMM) however the European 
Myeloma Network recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of NDMM include the use of 
lenalidomide, thalidomide, or bortezomib as maintenance therapy post-ASCT for patients with NDMM.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study CALGB 100104 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm 
parallel group study of maintenance therapy with lenalidomide or placebo following ASCT for NDMM.  
Study IFM 2005-002 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, pharmacological study 
designed to test the benefit of maintenance after consolidation therapy with lenalidomide versus 
placebo in prolonging response after ASCT.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study CALGB 100104 the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, was met as a statistically significant 
improvement in median PFS was observed in patients treated with lenalidomide maintenance. The risk 
of disease progression or death was reduced by 39% (HR=0.61, 95% CI [0.48 to 0.76]; log-rank p 
value < 0.001). The robustness of the PFS effect is supported by the updated and subgroup analyses, 
the results of which are in line with the interim analysis.   
This effect was further substantiated by results in OS. Overall survival data was still immature at the 
time of the interim analysis however in the updated analysis (1 February 2016 data cut-off date) the 
median OS for lenalidomide treatment was 111.0 months compared with 84.2 months for placebo 
treatment and this survival advantage of 26.8 months was statistically significant (HR=0.61; 95% CI 
[0.46 to 0.81]; log-rank p value < 0.001). 
Statistically significant improvements were observed in PFS2 (HR of 0.61, 95% CI [0.48 to 0.78] log-
rank p value < 0.001) confirming the benefit of the maintenance therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/108277/2017 
Page 95/99 
 
 
  
Based on the results from study IFM 2005-02, the primary endpoint, PFS, showed a highly significant 
HR of 0.45 (0.34 to 0.60, log-rank p value < 0.001). The updated analyses supported the interim 
analysis: at the March 2015 data cut-off, the risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 45% 
(HR=0.55; 95% CI [0.46 to 0.66]; log-rank p value < 0.001); at the February 2016 data cut-off, the 
risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 43% (HR= 0.57, 95% CI [0.47 to 0.68]; log-rank 
p value < 0.001). PFS2 data are supportive of the favourable effects of lenalidomide maintenance 
treatment. OS data was not statistically significant however there is evidence of a survival benefit for 
patients. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
One uncertainty was identified during the assessment regarding the initially proposed broad indication, 
however the indication was restricted to maintenance treatment and this uncertainty was satisfactorily 
addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In  both  studies,  there  were  about  twice  more  serious  TEAE  in  lenalidomide  arms  vs  placebo.  In  both 
lenalidomide arms, the main concerned SOCs was  “infections and infestations” with 16.1%  and 13,7 
% in lenalidomide arms in CALGB and IFM study respectively, vs (5.0 % and 3.6% ) in placebo arms in 
CALGB  and  IFM  study  respectively.  Reported  serious  infections  were  mainly  respiratory  infections, 
considering  the  main  reported  PT  bronchitis,  lung  infection  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection. 
Similar trends  in  these  serious  TEAE  are  observed when  comparing  both  studies.  These  serious  TEAE 
are coherent with the known safety profile of lenalidomide.  
The  most  commonly  reported  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  in  the  CALGB  lenalidomide  arm  were  neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia,  and  leukopenia  (>  15%  of  subjects  each),  followed  by  lymphopenia,  neutropenic 
infection,  lung  infection,  fatigue,  febrile  neutropenia,  diarrhea,  and  pneumonia  (>  5%  of  subjects 
each). The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in the IFM lenalidomide arm were neutropenia 
and leukopenia (> 15% of subjects each), followed by thrombocytopenia and lung disorder (> 5% of 
subjects  each).  Grade  5  TEAEs  were  reported  in  3  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  of  the 
CALGB study, of which 2 of 3 subjects died > 30 days after last treatment, and in 7 (2.4%) subjects in 
the lenalidomide arm of the IFM study, of which 3 of 7 subjects died > 30 days after last treatment . 
All individual Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in < 1% of CALGB lenalidomide subjects and in ≤ 0.4% of IFM 
lenalidomide subjects. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Previous analyses of the CALGB and IFM studies (data cut-off of May 2013) showed that subjects 
treated with lenalidomide maintenance therapy post-HDM/ASCT had a statistically significant increased 
risk for hematologic SPMs  and solid tumour SMPs (negative trend only) compared with subjects given 
placebo.  Based on safety data provided in studies IFM and CALGB (data cut-off of Feb 2016), a higher 
frequency of SPM was observed in patients in lenalidomide arm compared to placebo arm: CALGB: 
20.5% versus 11.8%, respectively, and IFM: 16.7% versus 10.9%.   
Based on the analysis according to the lenalidomide exposure, the frequency of subjects (pooled 
CALGB and IFM studies) with invasive SPMs was higher for the lenalidomide exposed population 
compared with the lenalidomide non-exposed population (107 [10.9%] versus 3 [5.6%], respectively). 
The incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies 
(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 
per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to 
Assessment report

Page 96/99 
 
 
  
lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after 
ASCT). The incidence rate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide 
arms and 1.05 per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients 
exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to 
lenalidomide after ASCT)This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
Furthermore, AML and B-cell malignancies are classified as an important  identified risk in the Risk 
Management Plan.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the CALGB study a statistically highly significant survival benefit, was demonstrated without 
identified factors biasing the result in favour of the experimental arm.  These favourable results were 
not replicated in the IFM study, but PFS and PFS2 data are supportive of favourable effects of 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy. 
The safety profile of lenalidomide in maintenance treatment is overall consistent with what is already 
known in lenalidomide NNMM treated patients. SPM is an important safety concern and an approximate 
doubling of the risk is a reasonable risk estimate. No new risks of lenalidomide were identified.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of lenalidomide in the target population is considered clinically relevant and, in the view of 
the safety profile, the benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Revlimid for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Revlimid (lenalidomide) is not similar to Imnovid 
(pomalidomide), Thalidomide Celgene (thalidomide), Kyprolis (carfilzomib), Farydak (panobinostat), 
Darzalex (Daratumumab) and Ninlaro (ixazomib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See Appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variations to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

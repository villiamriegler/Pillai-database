1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 28 July 2020 an application for a variation 
following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of indication to include the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab in the treatment of 
adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine based combination chemotherapy; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2 ,4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 18.0 for Opdivo and version 29.0 for Yervoy of the RMP have also been 
submitted. 
The worksharing procedure requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0026/2020, P/0027/2020 for Opdivo (Nivolumab) and P/0003/2017, P/0085/2015 for Yervoy 
(Ipilimumab) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0027/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the WSA did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH sought CHMP scientific advice in November 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/3330/4/2019/II). At that time 
the MAH presented their proposed approach to characterise the prognosis of patients with MSI-
H/dMMR mCRC. Based on the data submitted it was noted that a negative prognostic influence 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 8/175 
 
 
 
appeared reasonable to assume, but data were not considered sufficient to define MSI-H/dMMR status 
as an independent prognostic factor. Indeed, it was emphasised that it was not possible to neither 
determine an exact effect size or to isolate the relevance of the negative effects of MSI-H/dMMR and 
BRAF mutation status from the data/publications submitted. In addition during the procedure, 
agreement was sought on whether data from study CA209142 that include multiple (single-arm) 
cohorts (and which is the subject of this application) would support assessment of the benefit/risk ratio 
for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in 2L+ MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. The design of the phase 3b 
randomized study CA2098HW, which is intended to support the extension of the indication of the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for the treatment of patients in 1L/across lines of therapy, 
was also outlined. Lastly, a proposal to use RWE sourced for the Flatiron database as supportive for 
benefit-risk assessment of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the intended treatment setting was also 
discussed.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The clinical data submitted for this application are in support of the use of nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab for treatment of patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or MSIH (hereafter, 
dMMR or MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination 
chemotherapy. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide with a 5-year 
survival rate of approximately 14% in patients with metastatic disease (National Cancer Institute: 
surveillance, epidemiology and end results program – accessed 16 July 2020). Worldwide, CRC is the 
third most common form of cancer, with 1.8 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018, 
constituting 10.2% of all new cancers. Among all new CRC cases, 27% were diagnosed in Europe 
(Globocan 2018). Each year, there are about 880,792 deaths from CRC worldwide, which is 9.2% of all 
cancer deaths, making CRC the second most common cause of cancer death (Globocan 2018). The risk 
of developing CRC is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors (Chan and Giovannucci, 
2010).  
Among metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients, mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability 
high (MSI-H) tumor only accounts for approximately 5%. Patients with Lynch-like mCRC are associated 
with younger age, higher frequency of liver metastasis, more frequent resection of metastatic disease, 
thus more favourable prognosis compared to those with sporadic dMMR or MSI H mCRC. In both 
patient groups, alterations in the DNA MMR genes lead to accumulation of errors during DNA 
replication, especially in repetitive sequences known as microsatellites, causing high level of MSI. 
Thus, MSI is the molecular fingerprint of a deficient DNA mismatch repair. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
New proposed indication: 
-  OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer after 
prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy. 
- 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer after 
prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide with a 5-year survival 
rate of approximately 14% in patients with metastatic disease (national cancer institute, surveillance, 
epidemiology and End Result Program: Cancer Stat Facts: Colon and Rectum Cancer). Worldwide, CRC 
is the third most common form of cancer, with 1.8 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018, 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 10/175 
 
 
 
constituting 10.2% of all new cancers. Among all new CRC cases, 27% were diagnosed in Europe 
(Globocan 2018). This disease predominately occurs in developed regions with the highest rates being 
found in Australia/New Zealand and Western Europe and to a lower extent in Africa and South-Central 
Asia. There is a higher incidence in men vs. women with a ratio of 1.4:1.  
Each year, there are about 880,792 deaths from CRC worldwide, which is 9.2% of all cancer deaths, 
making CRC the second most common cause of cancer death (Globocan 2018). The risk of developing 
CRC is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors (Chan and Giovannucci, 2010). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease, including different mutation status (e.g., RAS, BRAF), 
consensus molecular subtype (CMS) categorization (CMS1, 2, 3 and 4), and MS/MMR status (dMMR or 
MSI-H vs. microsatellite stable [MSS]/proficient MMR [pMMR]). The complex molecular heterogeneity 
of this disease is not completely understood. Emerging evidence points to microsatellite instability 
high/mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) as a biomarker-defined distinct population, with an 
unmet need for effective therapy as compared to the MMR proficient mCRC population. 
A pooled analysis of 4 Phase 3 studies in the first-line treatment of mCRC (CAIRO, CAIRO2, COIN, and 
FOCUS) has shown PFS and OS to be significantly worse for patients with MSI-H/dMMR versus patients 
with microsatellite stable (MSS) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.57 and HR 1.35; 95% 
CI:1.13, 1.61, respectively, p= 0.001 for both). The poor prognosis may be in part conferred by the 
high rate of BRAF mutations associated with sporadic MSI-H/dMMR CRC, as approximately 30% of 
patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC carry BRAF V600E mutations. 
Approximately 15% of all CRC patients (including local and metastic disease) display high level MSI-H 
due to either a germline mutation in one of the genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair (Lynch 
syndrome, 3%) or somatic inactivation of the same pathway, most commonly through 
hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene (sporadic MSI-H, 12 %). Among mCRC patients, dMMR or MSI-H 
tumor only accounts for approximately 5%. Patients with Lynch-like mCRC are associated with younger 
age, higher frequency of liver metastasis, more frequent resection of metastatic disease, thus more 
favorable prognosis compared to those with sporadic dMMR or MSI H mCRC. In both patient groups, 
alterations in the DNA MMR genes lead to accumulation of errors during DNA replication, especially in 
repetitive sequences known as microsatellites, causing high level of MSI. Thus, MSI is the molecular 
fingerprint of a deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). 
Patients with early stage MSI-H CRC seem to have better prognosis than non-MSI-H/proficient MMR 
CRC, however, patients with metastatic MSI-H CRC have been reported to have a worse OS, and 
seemingly less benefit from conventional chemotherapy. A pooled analysis of four Phase 3 studies 
(CAIRO, CAIRO2, COIN, and FOCUS) in first-line mCRC participants treated with chemotherapy 
demonstrated that median PFS (6.2 months vs 7.6 months respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.12, 1.57) and OS (13.6 months vs 16.8 months, respectively; HR, 1.35; 
95% CI: 1.13, 1.61, respectively; p = 0.001 for both) were significantly worse for patients with dMMR 
compared with pMMR tumors, respectively. European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Consensus 
Guidelines for management of mCRC recommend testing for dMMR or MSI-H and indicate that “tumour 
MSI testing has strong predictive value for the use of immune check-point inhibitors in the treatment 
of patients with mCRC (II, B)”.  
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR and DNA analysis for MSI are different assays measuring the 
same biologic effect. There are well established methods to detect dMMR or MSI-H that are in use in 
many countries as standard of care. In addition to its utility in early stage II/III CRC (ie, better overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 11/175 
 
 
 
prognosis; potential lack of benefit from adjuvant fluoropyrimidines), the predictive value of dMMR or 
MSI-H status for anti-cancer treatment is becoming increasingly recognised in the metastatic setting. 
Despite the numerous treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the benefits of these 
therapies after first line therapy are modest and not durable, thus highlighting the need for more 
effective therapies. Although the addition of targeted therapy to conventional chemotherapy, including 
anti-EGFR and anti-VEGFR antibodies, has markedly improved the OS of patients with mCRC (22 to 29 
months), these patients experience disease progression due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to 
such therapies. In addition, limited predictive biomarkers can be used to select subsets of patients who 
may respond to targeted therapy, except RAS-mutation status, and more recently, BRAF mutation 
status. 
Patients with mCRC that progress post cytotoxic chemotherapy have a high unmet need. The initial 
control of the MSI-H tumour by immune surveillance gives strong rationale that nivolumab, with its 
mechanism of action that abrogates immune tolerance, will have significant clinical activity in MSI-
H/dMMR mCRC. 
Management 
Metastatic CRC 
Metastatic CRC is a complex and heterogeneous disease, with outcomes ranging from potential cure 
(ie, upfront resectable mCRC) to dismal (refractory wide-spread disease). Multi-modality treatment 
including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, especially in medically fit patients with borderline or 
potentially resectable disease, is the preferred approach in earlier lines of treatment in centres capable 
of providing multidisciplinary approach and adequate supportive care. The active agents in first- and 
second-line treatment of mCRC consist of fluoropyrimidines (5-FU, capecitabine), oxaliplatin, and 
irinotecan. Doublet or triplet chemotherapy is often combined with a monoclonal antibody inhibiting 
VEGF (bevacizumab or ziv-aflibercept); or EGFR (cetuximab or panitumumab; only indicated in RAS 
wild-type tumors), depending on biomarker status and primary tumour location.  
Despite the variation in practice, the most common management in earlier lines of therapy is intensive 
treatment consisting of combination chemotherapy and targeted agents. Combination chemotherapy 
leads to adverse events (any grade) or intolerance in approximately 95% of patients, with more than 
half the patients experiencing grade 3-5 AEs. Some patients are left with life-altering consequences, 
such as persistent sensory neuropathy. Biologics, such as anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR, bring additional 
class-specific toxicities. Finally, triplet chemotherapy (ie, FOLFOXIRI) with bevacizumab may be used 
in first-line setting when a regimen with a chance of higher response is needed (ie, for R0 resection, or 
symptomatic bulky disease) or in subjects with BRAF mutation. This treatment approach is associated 
with higher rate of Grade 3-4 events, SAEs, and rarely with AE-related deaths. 
Second-line treatment is typically a doublet chemotherapy, depending on the regimen used in first line 
setting. The multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, and the oral nucleoside analogue 
trifluridine/tipiracil are available options beyond second-line, but efficacy was modest in the pivotal 
trials, CORRECT and RECOURSE. Another third line option, anti-EGFR antibody with or without 
irinotecan, is also used in patients with RAS wildtype status who have not received anti-EGFR therapy 
in prior lines of therapy. 
More recently, additional targeted treatments have become available for a small subset of biomarker-
defined patients. Patients carrying tumors with BRAF V600E mutation are eligible for doublet targeted 
therapy against BRAF and EGFR in second line and beyond (combination of an anti-EGFR mAb with 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 12/175 
 
 
 
encorafenib). Additionally, larotrectinib is a new treatment option for patients whose tumours are 
positive for NTRK gene fusion, a rare alteration. 
Despite newer treatment options for mCRC, the benefit of systemic therapy beyond second-line 
treatment remains modest, and responses are rare. 
MSI-H mCRC 
Patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC experience relatively short PFS with first-line chemotherapy with 
or without targeted therapy (median PFS and OS on first-line chemotherapy were 6.0 and 26.3 
months, respectively) based on a recently published retrospective Association des Gastro-entérologues 
Oncologues (AGEO) study that included consecutive patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC from 2007 to 
2017 (Tougeron et al., 2020). Longer PFS (8.1 vs. 5.4 months, p = 0.0405) and OS (35.1 vs. 24.4 
months, p = 0.0747) were observed for irinotecan-based chemotherapy compared to oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapy. Retrospective analyses on several CRC studies also suggest poor outcomes on patients 
with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC when treated with chemotherapy. 
For second-line chemotherapy, median PFS and OS were 4.4 and 21.6 months in MSI-H patients in this 
AGEO study. Efficacy further diminished as patients progressed to 3L conventional therapy. Median PFS 
and OS were 3.6 months and 13.7 months, respectively. ORR results were not available in patients 
beyond 1L in this study. 
Despite the lack of consensus on benefit of non-immunotherapy treatment in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC, 
checkpoint inhibitors were shown to provide substantial and durable benefit in these patients relative 
to conventional chemotherapies. Breakthrough was made in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC population with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors in 2015, demonstrating substantial clinical efficacy with programmed cell 
death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor. ESMO guidelines recommend that MSI testing has strong predictive value for 
the use of immune check-point inhibitors in the treatment of patients with mCRC. The National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) colon and rectal cancer clinical practice guidelines list 
checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD1 monotherapy or combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab) as a 
treatment option for all patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC tumors beyond first-line, and in first-line 
and beyond for those who are not appropriate for intensive therapy (category 2B). More recently, 
KEYNOTE-177 study with PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy (pembrolizumab) showed statistically significant 
improvement in PFS vs chemotherapy in patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC in the first line setting. 
In summary, there are a number of conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy options in EU for 
medically fit patients with 1L dMMR or MSI-H mCRC but these are also associated with a high 
frequency and severity of adverse events. In dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients previously treated with 
fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy, therapeutic options are less effective and may be 
limited by prior therapy and/or mutational status.  
ESMO guidelines support MSI status testing as this is a predictive marker for immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, and NCCN guidelines support the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this patient 
population. There remains a high unmet medical need in EU for well tolerated therapeutic options 
offering meaningful clinical benefit across lines of therapy, and particularly in 2L and later. 
The benefit of current treatment with conventional chemotherapy with or without biologics for dMMR or 
MSI-H mCRC is not fully elucidated due to limited data available for this small subset of patients, but 
recent evidence suggests both poorer prognosis and abrogated response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in 
this group (Tougeron et al., 2020). Despite the numerous treatment options for mCRC, the benefit of 
these therapies after 1L therapy is modest, toxicity is significant, and complete radiographic responses 
are rare, thus highlighting the unmet medical need for more effective therapies in this population.

Within the EU, the existence of investigator-sponsored research studies (e.g. Netherlands – Drug 
Rediscovery Protocol [DRUP]) as well as requests for compassionate use/named patient use programs 
(Austria, Czech Republic, France) further emphasizes the need for new efficacious therapies. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab each have distinct, but complementary, mechanisms of action, which may 
enhance responsiveness to the combination regardless of baseline tumour PD-L1 expression 
(Hamanishi et al, 2007; Brahmer et al 2010; Pardoll, 2012; Wang et al, 2014; Das et al, 2015; Wei et 
al, 2018 and 2019;). 
Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction 
with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  
Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CTLA-4. CTLA-4 inhibition can induce de 
novo T-cell responses and recruit novel/additional T cells to the tumour. 
Adding limited doses of chemotherapy (2 cycles) to the nivo+ipi regimen could further enhance the 
immunogenic effect of nivo+ipi by releasing neoantigens from apoptosing tumour cells, increasing 
antigen presentation to dendritic cells, decreasing the myeloid-derived suppressive cells and increasing 
the ratio of cytotoxic lymphocytes to regulatory T-cells. 
The recommended dose of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the sought indication in this 
extension of indication variation procedure is 3 mg/kg OPDIVO IV infusion over 30-min followed by 1 
mg/kg ipilimumab IV infusion over 30-min Q3W for 4 dosing cycles, then OPDIVO 240 mg IV infusion 
over 30-min Q2W

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The foundational trial for the nivolumab + ipilimumab clinical development program in dMMR or MSI-H 
mCRC is the Phase 2 study, CA209142. The current application for mCRC is based primarily on data of 
subjects who received nivolumab + ipilimumab therapy in study CA209142 (Cohort 2) , with a 19-Feb-
2019 DBL.

The nivolumab clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) 
described by non-compartmental analysis, QT prolongation potential, and dose selection for Phase 2/3 
studies has been previously described. Additionally, the clinical pharmacology profile of nivolumab 1 
mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was characterized previously in subjects with advanced 
melanoma.  In an earlier population PK (PPK) analysis, both nivolumab and ipilimumab PK was 
described by a time-invariant model. However, a recent comprehensive analysis of nivolumab PPK 
found that nivolumab clearance (CL) decreased with time over the course of treatment.   
For this submission, nivolumab and ipilimumab PK in mCRC patients was characterized by PPK 
analyses. A pre-planned interim database lock (DBL) of the CA209142 combination cohort occurred on 
18-Aug-2017. Nivolumab and ipilimumab PK data from mCRC patients from this lock were pooled 
together with PK data from 24 and 15 studies for PPK analyses of nivolumab and ipilimumab, 
respectively. Another DBL of the CA209142 combination arm was performed on 19-Feb-2019 to 
provide more mature data. At this later DBL, 280 (~ 35% increase) and 56 (~ 12%) new nivolumab 
and ipilimumab concentration records were provided in CRC patients, respectively. The increase in 
nivolumab PK data or ipilimumab PK data from Study CA209142 based on the later DBL, represent a < 
1% data increase for the PPK datasets. PK parameters were re-estimated using the previously 
developed PPK model, and included the previous PPK dataset and additional PK data obtained from 
Study CA209142 (DBL on 19 Feb-2019).  
Nivolumab PK 
Sparse nivolumab PK data from CA209142 were pooled together with nivolumab PK data from 24 other 
studies (Table 2) for a PPK analysis.  
Nivolumab PK was well described by a linear 2-compartment model with time-varying total body 
clearance (CL). Nivolumab PK in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients is consistent with the known 
nivolumab PK characteristics.(reference is made to the approved PI) The geometric mean (coefficient 
of variation [CV]%) values of nivolumab clearance at steady state (CLss), volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss), terminal half-life at steady state (t1/2,ss) following IV administration of nivolumab 
(3 mg/kg) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) Q3W in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients were 7.23 mL/h 
(42.4%), 6.19 L (18.2%), and 25.7 days (54.8%), respectively . No covariates were found to have a 
clinically meaningful effect on nivolumab PK. 
Nivolumab PPK analysis was conducted to characterize the PK of nivolumab in 6468 subjects with non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), melanoma, RCC, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), or CRC who received nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab from 25 
studies (Table 3.3.1.1-1 in the PPK report). The analysis dataset included data for nivolumab doses 
ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, 240 mg, or 360 mg, and dosing frequencies of once every 2 or 3 weeks 
(Q2W or Q3W).

The nivolumab PPK model was developed in three steps: base, full, and final models (figure 1). 
Figure 1. schematic Overview of Nivolumab Population Pharmacokinetic Model Development 
The final nivolumab model was a two-compartment, zero-order IV infusion and time-varying CL model 
(sigmoidal Emax function) with a proportional residual error model, with random effects on CL, VC, VP, 
and EMAX; and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The final nivolumab PPK model 
contained ipilimumab regimen, chemotherapy coadministration, BBWT, eGFR, PS, sex, and race on CL, 
ipilimumab coadministration and PS on change of CL over time, and BBWT and sex on VC. Table 3.1.1-

The maximal change in CL (Emax) was similar across dose regimens and tumor types. The maximal 
model predicted decrease in CL was ~21% in subjects with PS of 0, and ~31% in subjects with PS >

0. The time for half-maximal reduction was ~92 days (2200 hours). Decrease in nivolumab CL 
appeared to be associated with clinical response. Patients with CR or PR showed the greatest CL 
reduction.  
The effects of tumor type, line of therapy, chemo co-medication, baseline PS, baseline eGFR, BBWT, 
sex, race on nivolumab PK (CL and/or Vc) were either not statistically significant (the 95% CI includes 
0) or not clinically relevant (less than ±20% effect on the typical value of a model parameter relative 
to the reference value) (Figure 8).  
Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W, Q6W and Q12W regimens did not have a 
statistically significant or clinically relevant effect on nivolumab CL (Figure 3.1.1-1). The CL of 
nivolumab when given in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W was higher (by ~29%) compared 
to nivolumab monotherapy.

The nivolumab PK in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients is consistent with the known nivolumab PK 
characteristics. Nivolumab CL (baseline [CL0] and steady state [CLss]) appeared to be numerically 
lower following nivolumab monotherapy relative to those following nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg Q3W combination therapy. Following the same combination therapy, nivolumab PK 
parameters are similar between dMMR or MSI-H CRC and mRCC patients (Table 4).

Consistent with PK parameter results, nivolumab exposure (Cmin/Cmax/Cavg following the first dose 
and at steady state) appeared to be numerically higher following nivolumab monotherapy relative to 
those following nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W combination therapy. However the 
difference is generally less than 20% except for CAVG1 (~ 26%), and thus unlikely to be clinically

Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analysis have been conducted evaluating the effect of ADA, baseline albumin (BALB), 
baseline lactose dehydrogenase (BLDH), and baseline tumor burden on nivolumab CL (Table 6 and 
Table 7).

Baseline Albumine (BALB) 
The sensitivity analysis indicated nivolumab CL is higher in subjects with lower BALB.  
Baseline lactose dehydrogenase (BLDH) 
Nivolumab CL was higher in subjects with higher BLDH, and the 95th percentile can reach 44% relative 
to a reference subject (200 IU/mL). The sensitivity analysis of BLDH is done together with BTSIZE 
rather than separately, causing removal of more data due to lack of tumor size, and changed the 
variability of BLDH values. 
BTSIZE 
The sensitivity analysis indicated that the effect of BTSIZE on nivolumab CL was statistically significant 
but was within 20% of the CL of a reference subject. In general, nivolumab CL was higher in subjects 
with a higher BTSIZE;  
Anti Drug Antibody (ADA) 
The effect of ADA (assessed by the 3rd generation assay) on CL was assessed in an ad-hoc sensitivity 
analysis. When ADA was present, nivolumab CL was estimated to be approximately 20% higher. The 
effects of positive anti-nivolumab antibody status (using 3rd generations of anti-nivolumab antibody 
assays) on CL were assessed as time-varying covariate. A positive anti-nivolumab antibody status was 
estimated to increase nivolumab CL by 20% compared to a negative anti-nivolumab antibody status. 
Best Overall response (BOR) 
The magnitude of the change in CL was higher in responders than non-responders. In the sensitivity 
analysis, BOR was a covariate on the change of CL with time. The ratio CLss/CL0 was 65.4%, 65.9%, 
75.2%, and 80.4% in CR, PR, SD, and PD subjects, respectively. In general, subjects with CR and PR 
were observed to have greater decrease in CL compared to non-responders with SD and PD. This 
observation is consistent with that found for ipilimumab.

The nivolumab final PK model was used to simulate nivolumab PK profiles in dMMR or MSI-H CRC 
patients following nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (4 doses) via either a 30 min or 60 
min nivolumab infusion duration. Equivalent nivolumab PK profiles were observed between a 30 min 
and 60 min infusion duration (Figure 16). The only difference is the 30 min infusion achieves Cmax 
earlier than the 60 min infusion duration as expected.

The predictive performance of the full nivolumab PPK model was evaluated using pcVPC for the 
updated dataset. Figure 17 and Figure 18 show the pcVPC plots of all nivolumab concentration versus 
time after the previous dose and trough concentration versus time after the first dose, respectively.

The pcVPC plots show that the full nivolumab PPK model adequately characterized the data from Study  
A209142.  
The effect of covariates on nivolumab PK was re-estimated using the full model for the updated 
dataset. Parameter estimates (Table 8) and the covariate effects (Figure 19) obtained from the 
updated dataset are similar to those obtained from the previous nivolumab PPK analysis dataset (data 
not shown).

Ipilimumab PK 
Ipilimumab PPK analysis was conducted to characterize the PK of ipilimumab in 3411 subjects with 
NSCLC, SCLC, melanoma, RCC, HCC, or CRC who received ipilimumab alone or in combination with 
nivolumab from 15 studies (Table 9 . The analysis dataset included data for ipilimumab doses ranging 
from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, and dosing frequencies of once every 3, 6, or 12 weeks (Q3W, Q6W, or Q12W).

Ipilimumab PK was well described by a linear 2-compartment model with time-varying CL. Ipilimumab 
PK in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients is consistent with the known ipilimumab PK characteristics. No 
covariates were found to have a clinically meaningful effect on ipilimumab PK. 
The ipilimumab PPK model was developed in three steps: base, full, and final models.

The final ipilimumab PPK model was a 2-compartment, zero-order IV infusion model with time-varying 
CL model (sigmoidal-Emax function). The covariates retained in the final model are SCLC tumor type, 
line of therapy, nivolumab dose of 1 mg/kg Q3W and 3 mg/kg Q2W on CL and combination therapy on

The maximal change in CL (Em ax) was similar across tumor types. The maximal model predicted 
decrease in CL was ~5% and 22% for ipilimumab monotherapy and ipilimumab in combination with 
nivolumab respectively and the time to half-maximal reduction is ~106 days (2550 hours). In general, 
responders (CR and PR subjects) showed a greater decrease in CL over time as compared to non-
responders (SD and PD subjects).  
The effects of  tumor type, nivo dosing regimen, line of therapy, BBWT, and BLDH on ipilimumab PK 
(CL and Vc) were either not statistically significant (the 95% CI includes 0) or not clinically relevant 
(less than ±20% effect on the typical value of a model parameter relative to the reference value 
(Figure 27). 
In addition, the sensitivity analyses found that the effect of time-varying ADA, BALB, and BTSIZE on 
ipilimumab CL was either not statistically significant (the 95% CI includes 0) or not clinically relevant 
(less than ± 20% effect on the typical value of a model parameter relative to the reference value)

Sensitivity Analyses 
BTSIZE 
Ipilimumab CL was significantly [95% CI does not include 0] higher in subjects with higher BTSIZE; 
however, the magnitude of the difference was within the ± 20% boundary (data not shown) and not 
likely to be clinically relevant. The resulting parameter estimates obtained from this analysis were in 
good agreement with those obtained in the final model. 
BALB 
Ipilimumab CL was significantly [95% CI does not include 0] lower in subjects with higher BALB; 
however, the magnitude of the difference was within the ± 20% boundary (data not shown) and not 
likely to be clinically relevant. The resulting parameter estimates obtained from this analysis were in 
good agreement with those obtained in the final model.

Ipilimumab ADA measured by the second generation assay with a drug tolerant limit of 75 μg/mL  did 
not have a statistically significant effect on CL (increase by 5.7% [calculated as exp(0.0558)*100-
100]) when ipilimumab was administered with nivolumab. The 95% CI (-1.00 to 11.3%) fell within 
20% of the reference value. However, anti-ipilimumab antibodies measured by the first generation 
assay with a drug tolerance limit of 10 μg/mL (), were statistically significant and increased the typical 
value of CL by 31.5% [calculated as exp (0.274)*100-100] when ipilimumab was administered as 
monotherapy. Given the complexity associated with incorporation of time-varying CL into the model 
and the time-varying nature of ADA measurements, graphical assessments of the effect of ADA on 
nivolumab CL were not made.  
BOR 
The effect of BOR on change in ipilimumab CL was assessed in an ad-hoc sensitivity analysis  This 
analysis was conducted for studies with available BOR information.

subjects receiving ipilimumab monotherapy. 
Assessment of Temporal Changes in Clearance 
Figure 30 demonstrates the change in ipilimumab CL over time. The maximal model predicted 
decrease in CL was ~5% and 22% for ipilimumab monotherapy and ipilimumab in combination in 
nivolumab, respectively; the time for half maximal reduction was ~106 days (2550 hours). The 
variability around EMAX predicted by the model was ~38.5%. figure 30.

The ipilimumab final PK model was used to simulate ipilimumab PK profiles in dMMR or MSI-H CRC 
patients following nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (4 doses) via either a 30 min or 90 
min ipilimumab infusion duration. Equivalent ipilimumab PK profiles were observed between a 30 min 
and 90 min infusion duration (Figure 35). The only difference is the 30 min infusion achieves Cmax 
earlier than the 90 min infusion duration as expected.

The effect of covariates on ipilimumab PK was re-estimated using the full model for the updated

Immunogenicity 
There were 109 subjects with evaluable ADA for nivolumab, and 107 subjects with evaluable ADA for 
ipilimumab in nivo with ipi combination treated dMMR or MSI-H mCRC subjects from Study CA209142. 
The incidence of nivolumab ADA was 25.7% with 0 persistent-positive subjects and 2 neutralising 
antibody-positive subjects (Table 14). In all nivolumab ADA positive subjects, the greatest titer value 
observed was 128, which occurred in 2 subjects. All other ADA positive subjects had titer values of 64 
or less. 
The incidence of ipilimumab ADA was 4.7% with 0 persistent-positive subjects and 0 neutralizing 
antibody-positive subjects. In all ipilimumab ADA positive subjects, the greatest titer value observed 
was 8.  
The observed incidences of nivolumab ADA and ipilimumab ADA in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients 
were similar to those observed in mRCC patients in CA209214, for which the same nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab regimen was applied.

Nivolumab trough PK samples were collected on Weeks 4, 10, 13, 25 and every 24 weeks thereafter in 
dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients in the CA209142 combination arm. Trough PK samples collected within 
+/- 3 days collection window were plotted by their ADA status. As shown in Figure 39, distribution of 
nivolumab trough concentrations in patients with positive nivolumab ADA appeared to be within the 
trough concentration range observed in patients with negative nivolumab ADA. No positive nivolumab 
ADA trough samples were observed beyond Week 25.

Justification of the Recommended Dose 
The recommended dosing regimen for the treatment of adult patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC after 
prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy is 3 mg/kg nivolumab over 30 min plus 1 mg/kg 
ipilimumab over 30 min every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 dosing cycles, then nivolumab 240 mg every 2 
weeks over 30 min. 
Dose and Schedule 
The safety and tolerability results from the dose ranging study in melanoma patients (Study 
CA209004) and the dose ranging cohort in subjects with non-MSI-H CRC in Study CA209142 informed 
the selected investigational combination regimen, nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W 
for 4 doses, in dMMR or MSI-H CRC patients. 
In Study CA209004, Cohort 3 (3 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W) exceeded the 
protocol-defined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Cohorts 2 (1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab Q3W) and 2a (3 mg/kg nivolumab+1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W) were identified as the MTDs. 
Therefore, the following 3 combination dose levels were selected for the safety cohort in Study 
CA209142 in subjects with non-MSI-H mCRC: 
• 
• 
Level 1: 1 mg/kg nivolumab +1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W 
Level 2 
o  Level 2a: 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W 
o  Level 2a: 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W 
While both regimens at Level 2 were deemed tolerable, the combination regimen of 3 mg/kg 
nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W was selected for evaluation in MSI-H metastatic CRC subjects 
in Study CA209142 due to the following considerations: 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 76/175 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Similar clinical activity was observed between the 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab 
Q3W (n = 17, ORR: 47%) and the 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W (n = 16, 
ORR: 50%) cohorts in CA209004 (CA209004 CSR, Table 7.2-1)21 
•  Numerically higher safety events were observed in the 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab Q3W (drug related Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation: 4 out of 10 patients) 
group relative to the 3 mg/kg nivolumab +1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W (drug related Grade 3-4 
AEs leading to discontinuation: 1 out of 10 patients) group in non-MSI-H mCRC patients in 
CA209142 (CA209142 CSR, Table S.NH.6.24)12 
Additionally, the majority of responses to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab occur in the 
first 12 weeks in CA209004. At the time of initial CA209142 study design, safety data following 
continuous ipilimumab administration was very limited since the approved ipilimumab monotherapy 
regimen is every 3 weeks for four doses in the FDA and EMA approved label. Therefore, a total of 4 
doses of ipilimumab administration Q3W was chosen for the duration of nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
combination phase in the first combination cohort of Study CA209142 in dMMR or MSI-H CRC patients 
after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy. 
Moreover, the maintenance dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W was selected for Study CA209142 based 
upon collective experience of nivolumab monotherapy across multiple tumor types. The analyses of 
safety, efficacy, and E-R data from the Phase 1 study CA209003 evaluating antitumor activity over a 
dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W in several tumor types including RCC, NSCLC, and 
melanoma has shown that nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W is active across multiple tumor types. Thus 
starting at week 12, which is after the completion of the four doses of combined nivolumab and 
ipilimumab, nivolumab would continue to be administered every two weeks until progression. 
The selected dosing regimen, nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q3W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses 
followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W maintenance, demonstrated a favourable benefit-risk in Study 
CA209142 in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy. 
Compelling efficacy was observed with median PFS of 36.0 months, median OS not reached after a 
median follow up of 31.5 months (range 27.5 –43.3months), and a BICR-assessed ORR of 59.7%. The 
safety profile is consistent with safety outcomes observed across other tumour types with the same 
posology. 
Previously, PK modelling and simulations demonstrated that the range of nivolumab systemic 
exposures resulting from either nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or 240 mg Q2W were similar across a wide 
range of body weights for nivolumab monotherapy. Based on the current PPK analyses, nivolumab PK 
following co-administration of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W was similar to that seen with nivolumab 
monotherapy. The same conclusions were drawn with the current combination PPK models, similar 
exposures were predicted for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W monotherapy 
administered during the maintenance phase following combination nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy, 
thus supporting the use of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W flat dose maintenance treatment. 
Infusion Duration 
In Study CA209142, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab used a 60 minute infusion duration 
for nivolumab, and a 90 minute infusion duration for ipilimumab. Reducing the nivolumab infusion time 
from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, and ipilimumab infusion time from 90 min to 30 min, are supported by 
the following clinical data. 
Nivolumab 
The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered as a 30 min infusion (n=369) or a 60 min infusion 
(n=368) was assessed in Study CA209153 in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC. No 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021

clinically meaningful differences were observed in the overall safety profile between the 30 minute and 
the 60 minute infusion group, including the frequency (2% for both groups) of 
hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions (of any cause or treatment-related).  
In addition, nivolumab final PK model was used to simulate nivolumab PK profiles in dMMR or MSI-H 
CRC patients following nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (4 doses) via either a 30 min 
or 60 min nivolumab infusion duration. Equivalent nivolumab PK profiles were observed between a 30 
min and 60 min infusion duration (Figure 16). 
Ipilimumab 
Ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In Study CA184022,25 where 
ipilimumab was administered up to a dose of 10 mg/kg, on-study drug related hypersensitivity events 
(Grade 1 - 2) were reported in 1 (1.4%) subject in the 0.3 mg/kg and in 2 (2.8%) subjects in the 10 
mg/kg group. There were no drug-related hypersensitivity events reported in the 3 mg/kg group. 
Across the 3 treatment groups, no Grade 3 - 4 drug-related hypersensitivity events were reported, and 
there were no reports of infusion reactions. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely 
administered as a 90 minute infusion in large phase 3 studies, in prostate cancer (Study CA184043) 26 
and as adjuvant therapy for stage 3 melanoma (Study CA184029),27 with no infusion reactions 
occurring in subjects. Administering 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab represents one-tenth of the 10 mg/kg 
dose. 
Additionally, the same combination regimen (3 mg/kg nivolumab over 30 min plus 1 mg/kg ipilimumab 
over 30 min every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 dosing cycles) has been studied in melanoma patients 
(n=180). The reported hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (all-causality, any grade) was 5.0% (n=9). 
Grade 3 drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were reported in 1 subject (0.6%; infusion 
related reaction) which led to permanent discontinuation of study therapy. 
Moreover, ipilimumab final PK model was used to simulate ipilimumab PK profiles in dMMR or MSI-H 
CRC patients following nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (4 doses) via either a 30 min 
or 90 min ipilimumab infusion duration. Equivalent ipilimumab PK profiles were observed between a 30 
min and 90 min infusion duration (Figure 35). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses for safety and efficacy in subjects with dMMR or MSI-H metastatic 
CRC from Study CA209142 were not conducted, as only one dosing regimen was evaluated in dMMR or 
MSI-H mCRC patients.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has presented the results from two population PK assessments of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab with interim and full datasets from its clinical evaluation in patients with mismatch repair 
deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The 
methodological aspects are adequate to address the objective planned.  
A previously developed structural population PK model was implemented to characterize the time-
course of nivolumab in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients. The Applicant conducted a joint analysis 
including all available experimental information from clinical trials but showing no differences in terms 
Assessment report

of PK parameters between the claimed indications (dMMR or MSI-H mCRC) and previous cancer 
indications.  
Nivolumab 
In general, the model (2017) shares the same elements that were identified in previous submissions, 
showing an adequate description of the data. Then, the MAH conducted a separate analysis (Full 
Nivolumab popPK model) when data from the CA209142 combination arm was available (2019). A 
negligible difference could be appreciated between both dataset in the effect of covariates. The 
discrepancies could be attributed to unprecise parameters (>RSE), but no clinically relevant differences 
were observed. PPK parameters estimated from the updated PPK analysis are comparable with those 
from the previous PPK model, indicating that these additional nivolumab concentration data had no 
impact on PPK model results, and therefore did not change any conclusions from the previous PPK 
analyses.   
No relevant PK differences were observed when the duration of the infusion was evaluated (30 vs 60 
min), showing that a shorter infusion times does not anticipate changes in safety or efficacy profile. In 
addition, the sensitivity analysis revealed the lack of parameter differences by tumor type. Other 
covariates were evaluated in the forest plot and sensitivity analysis, showing the lack of any clinically 
relevant effect, except for Best Overall Response: as expected, patients with complete or partial 
remission (CR or PR) showed a greater decrease in CL compared to non-responders with SD and PD. 
However, the magnitude of the effect is not considered clinically relevant. The justification might be 
related to disease progression, where responder patients showed a greater decrease in CL. The 
hypothetical reason for this observation is that higher CL is associated with greater disease severity. 
Thus, in subjects when disease condition is improved over time in responders, a decrease in CL was 
observed. The underlying mechanism is unclear and may be related to decreases in cachexia in 
subjects who respond to therapy. Nevertheless, no clinical biomarker has been identified to anticipate 
the classification of individual patients for an optimal dose schedule selection. Differences in exposure 
across the different exposure endpoints vs the type of patients revealed the lack of any 
significant/clinical trend or threshold that would help to optimise the efficacy/safety balance. 
Furthermore, the higher CL of nivolumab when given in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W 
was higher (by ~29%) compared to nivolumab monotherapy is not expected to be clinically relevant 
since the dosing regimen of nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Q3W x 4 doses has 
demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in melanoma patients. In addition, the sensitivity analyses 
found that the effects of ADA, baseline albumin (BALB), baseline lactose dehydrogenase (BLDH), and 
baseline tumor burden on nivolumab CL were either not statistically significant (the 95% CI include 0) 
or not clinically relevant (≤ 20%). In particular, lower levels of serum ALB are indicative of cancer 
related cachexia, which causes higher elimination and metabolic turnover of proteins. An association of 
lower BALB with higher nivolumab CL may therefore be a surrogate for an underlying cachexic 
condition and a decrease in nivolumab CL may be indicative of decreased cachexia and improvement in 
disease state. The effect of can reach 24% of subject (ie, 4.0 g/dL) at 5th percentile of BALB value. 
But the effect is still not clinically relevant (< 20%), because both 5th and 95th percentiles of BALB 
could fall within 20% of a reference subject if the reference value was chosen as 3.8 g/dL. As well, the 
sensitivity analysis indicated that the effect of BTSIZE on nivolumab CL was statistically significant but 
was within 20% of the CL of a reference subject. In general, nivolumab CL was higher in subjects with 
a higher BTSIZE; however, the magnitude of the effect is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
Furthermore, the effect of anti-nivolumab antibody positive status on nivolumab CL is not clinically 
relevant. No clinically relevant difference in nivolumab CL was found in Japanese and non-Japanese 
subjects.

Ipilimumab 
Ipilimumab PK in dMMR or MSI-H mCRC patients is consistent with the known ipilimumab PK 
characteristics. Based on the results from the forest plot analyses, clinically relevant changes in CL, 
VC, Q and VP are predicted on patients with extreme BBWT. According to the distribution of ipilimumab 
exposure in dMMR/MSI-H CRC patients in patients with body weight <50, 50-90, and >90kg 
demonstrates a roughly clinically relevant increase (>20%) in exposure across the body weight sub-
groups compared to patients between 50-90 kg. However, no statistical relationship was established 
between body weight and clinical responses, indicating that the different exposure in patients with 
extreme body weights does not explain differences in terms of efficacy. 
Sensitivity analyses did not identify any clinically relevant changes in exposure in the evaluated 
covariates. In the same line as observed for nivolumab, a trend is observed based on the BOR, since 
CR and PR patients showed a greater decrease in CL compared to SD and PD patients. No clinical 
biomarker has been identified able to anticipate the classification of individual patients for an optimal 
dose schedule selection. Differences in exposure across the different exposure endpoints vs the type of 
patients revealed the lack of any significant/clinical trend or threshold that would help to optimise the 
efficacy/safety balance. The magnitude of the effect is not considered clinically relevant. 
Ipilimumab CL was significantly [95% CI does not include 0] higher in subjects with higher BTSIZE; 
however, the magnitude of the difference was within the ± 20% boundary and not likely to be clinically 
relevant. The resulting parameter estimates obtained from this analysis were in good agreement with 
those obtained in the final model. Ipilimumab CL was significantly [95% CI does not include 0] lower in 
subjects with higher BALB; however, the magnitude of the difference was within the ± 20% boundary 
and not likely to be clinically relevant. The resulting parameter estimates obtained from this analysis 
were in good agreement with those obtained in the final model. Taken together, the data presented on 
ADA findings suggest that the effect of immunogenicity was not clinically relevant. 
Dose selection 
For the combination treatment, the clinical data from Study CA209142 and the results of the PPK 
analysis support the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q3W followed 
by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in the treatment of subjects with recurrent or metastatic dMMR or MSI-H 
CRC. As well, for both products, the reduction of the infusion duration from 60 minutes to 30 minutes 
for Nivolumab and 90 minutes to 30 minutes for Ipilimumab seems adequate based on the simulations 
and safety data provided and a change in safety or efficacy profile is not anticipated for the proposed 
combination treatment of patients with mCRC.  
Analyses from E-R across multiple monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab have shown that the 
clearance of these antibodies is associated with the efficacy endpoints investigated. Adequate 
resolution of the effect of exposure of nivolumab/ipilimumab and their clearance on efficacy would 
require data from multiple dose levels.  
The observed safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination is acceptable in subjects with 
advanced metastatic CRC. The safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination in MSI-H 
metastatic CRC was consistent with safety outcomes for other indications for which the same 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination regimen is approved for use (metastatic RCC).   
In summary, while the E-R analyses were not conducted for efficacy or safety endpoints in combination 
nivolumab + ipilimumab therapy because of lack of dosing range data in the dMMR or MSI-H mCRC 
patients, the observed data from MSI-H metastatic CRC subjects in Study CA209142 shows a clinically 
meaningful benefit and acceptable safety profile. These data were supportive of the dosing 
recommendation for this combination therapy in metastatic CRC patients.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of nivolumab and ipilimumab have been characterised in dMMR or 
MSI-H mCRC patients using all PK available information from previous clinical trials and the previously 
developed population PK models for each drug. No clinical concerns remain, and the uncertainties have 
been properly solved.

Title of Study 
Study CA209142 - A Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Nivolumab and Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Recurrent 
and Metastatic Microsatellite High (MSI-H) Colon Cancer (CheckMate 142) 
Methods 
CA209142 (Overman et al. 2018, NCT02060188) is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, multi-center, 
multi-cohort study including nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combinations in adults with dMMR 
or MSI-H and pMMR/non-MSI-H unresectable mCRC with an efficacy objective of demonstrating a 
clinically meaningful ORR > 30% in these distinct subject populations, i.e., dMMR or MSI-H mCRC. The 
cohorts evaluated in CA209142 were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cohort 1: nivolumab monotherapy in MSI-H mCRC 
Cohort 2: nivolumab + ipilimumab in MSI-H mCRC 
Cohort 3: nivolumab + ipilimumab in first-line MSI-H mCRC 
Cohort 4: nivolumab + ipilimumab + cobimetinib in pMMR/non-MSI-H mCRC 
Cohort 5: nivolumab + BMS-986016 in MSI-H mCRC 
Cohort 6: nivolumab + daratumumab in non-MSI-H mCRC 
The interim CSR for CA209142, object of this report, is based on the 18-Aug-2017 clinical database 
lock (DBL) and presents the results of the subjects with MSI-H/dMMR CRC treated with nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab (cStage1 and cStage2, nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg) cohort (all combination treated, N=119) and the results from a subset of these 
subjects who had received prior 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (5FU-Oxa-Iri), (N=82). 
A later DBL of the combination arm (Cohort 2) was performed on 19-Feb-2019 to provide more mature 
data and the updated results have been submitted as part of this application.

FOLLOW-UP MIN. 12 WEEKS. SURVIVAL FOLLOW-UP MAX. OF 3 YEARS.
The study consisted of 3 phases: screening, treatment and follow up. Tumor responses were assessed 
using RECIST v1.1 criteria beginning 6 weeks after first dose, and continuing every 6 weeks (± 1 
week) for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression. Subjects were 
treated until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-defined reasons. Treatment beyond 
initial investigator-assessed progression was permitted if the subject had a clinical benefit and was 
tolerating study drug per investigator assessment. 
Study participants 
The study population included adults (≥ 18 years) who had disease progression during, after, or had 
been intolerant to therapy with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC. 
Given the rarity of the dMMR or MSI-H population, patients with different lines of prior therapy were 
allowed. For this target population, key inclusion criteria included: 
•  Subjects must have signed the approved written informed consent form before the 
performance of any related procedures and must have been willing to comply with scheduled 
visits, treatment, tests, tumor biopsies and other requirements 
•  Histologically confirmed CRC 
•  Metastatic or recurrent CRC 
•  Microsatellite instability expression detected by an accredited laboratory per local 
regulations 
• 
Prior treatment: 
 
For subjects with recurrent or metastatic MSI-H CRC: 
•  Progression during, after, or have been intolerant to ≥ 1 line 
treatment(s) for their metastatic disease, which must have 
included, at least, 
o  A fluoropyrimidine, and 
o  Oxaliplatin or irinotecan,

Subject enrolment 
CA209142 was originally designed using a single Simon optimal two-stage design including both 
monotherapy and combination therapy cohorts which meant a sequential enrolment of C1 and C2. Per 
the protocol, if the ORR was 3-6 out of the first 19 centrally-confirmed MSI-H subjects in C1 mStage 1, 
C2 cStage 1 would open. Following this, enrolment in C2 cStage 1 was initiated and first patient first 
treatment (FPFT) took place on 29 May 2015. Enrolment in C2 cStage 1 took place, then, from May to 
October 2015, and a total of 27 subjects received the investigational product. Of these, 20 were 
assessed as being MSI-H by the central laboratory. On 18-Feb-2016, confirmation of response in at 
least 7 of the first 19 subjects who had been assessed as MSI-H by the central laboratory in C2 
cStage1 was reached and therefore, C2 cStage 2 was opened for enrolment on 19-Feb-2016 after 
closure of enrolment of C1 mStage 2. 
The original version of the study protocol and SAP specified that the analysis set would be those 
subjects who had been assessed as being MSI-H by the central laboratory and the target sample size 
would be 48 subjects, although enrolment was based on local lab determination of dMMR or MSI-H. As 
the trial was in progress, some challenges and delays in obtaining the MSI status results from the 
central laboratory were observed, which led to a need for over-enrolment to ensure sufficient number 
of centrally-confirmed MSI-H subjects were treated. Based on experience form Cohort 1 and the 
observed rate of unconfirmed dMMR or MSI-H subjects in C2 cStage 1 (approximately 30%), it was 
estimated that, at least, 70 subjects would need to be enrolled to ensure the planned 48 centrally 
confirmed subjects. After the criteria for initiating C2 cStage 2 had been met on 18-Feb-2016, 
enrolment in C2 cStage 2 was initiated. In September of 2016, enrolment in C2 cStage 2 was closed 
with a total of 119 MSI-H subjects based on the local testing. Among them, 70 subjects were 
confirmed as MSI-H by the central laboratory. 
Treatments 
Subjects with DMMR/MSI-H CRC treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (cStage1 and 
cStage2) cohort were treated with nivolumab administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg combined 
with ipilimumab administered IV over 90 minutes at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed 
by nivolumab administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression. By 
changes included in Revised Protocol version 08 (8 Jun 2020), nivolumab infusion duration was 
reduced to 30 minutes for all cohorts. 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 84/175 
 
 
 
Dose reductions were not permitted. Criteria for dose delays, resumption and treatment 
discontinuation were included in the protocol. 
Treatment would continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Based on preliminary data from this study, in subjects with MSI-H mCRC tumours suggest that some 
subjects achieve response and deepening of response with longer treatment duration. Therefore, a 
strict stopping rule at 2-years was not considered ideal for CA209-142. Instead, Revised Protocol 07 
(05-Feb-2019), incorporated the option to discontinue treatment after minimum of 24 months of 
treatment in subjects who had achieved maximum clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator and 
described below.  
Subjects who attain all the following criteria would have the option to discontinue treatment due to 
maximum clinical benefit: 
•  Maximum clinical benefit per Investigator 
•  Minimum 12 months of treatment after date of first response (PR or 
CR) if the patient achieved response 
•  Minimum 24 months between first dose of study treatment and 
discontinuation for maximum clinical benefit 
•  No progression since week 12 of study treatment 
Re-initiation was an option for subjects who progressed within 1 year (≤ 52 weeks) of discontinuation 
for maximum clinical benefit, as long as the eligibility criteria for re-initiation were met:  
• 
• 
Investigator assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease progression 
Tolerance of study drug 
•  Stable performance status 
•  Adequate blood, liver, kidney and cardiac function per Inclusion criteria 2i (Section 3.3.1) 
•  Adequate re-initiation screening requirements per Table 5.1-8 
• 
Treatment Re-initiation will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg. CNS metastases) 
•  Subjects have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form for re-
initiation in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. 
Clinical activity of reinitiating study treatment with nivolumab or nivolumab combinations will be 
evaluated in CA209142. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab cohort (C2) were as follows: 
Primary objective: 
• 
To evaluate the investigator-assessed ORR of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in 
subjects with metastatic dMMR or MSI-H CRC. 
Secondary objectives: 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 85/175 
 
 
 
• 
• 
To evaluate the independent radiology review committee (BICR)-assessed ORR of nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic dMMR or MSI-H CRC. 
To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) 
Key exploratory objectives: assessments of safety, PFS and OS, immunogenicity, association between 
PD-L1 and efficacy, discordance between repeat MSI testing by a central lab and prior MSI testing pep 
local labs, and evaluation of patient-reported outcomes, including health related quality of life and 
general health status. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
Primary endpoint: 
o  ORR assessed by the investigator: number of MSI-H subjects with a best overall 
response (BOR) of confirmed CR or PR, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, divided by the 
number of treated MSI-H subjects. The investigator-assessed ORR was further 
characterized by the duration of response (DOR): time from first confirmed 
response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented tumour progression as 
determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred 
first. DOR was computed for subjects with a BOR of confirmed PR or CR. 
To assess consistency of ORR, investigator-assessed ORR (primary analysis) will be summarized for 
the following subgroups with at least 5 subjects: 
o  Age (< 65, ≥ 65, ≥ 65 and < 75, ≥ 75) 
o  Region (US/Canada, Europe, Rest of World). 
o  Gender (Male, Female) 
o  Race (white, black, Asian, and other) 
o  Lynch syndrome (yes/no) 
o  K-RAS and B-RAF wild-type, K-RAS mutation, B-RAF mutation 
o  ECOG (0, ≥ 1) 
o  Time from the initial diagnosis to first dose of nivolumab (0 - < 1, 1 - < 2, 2 - < 3, ≥ 3 
years) 
o  Number of prior therapies (0, 1, 2, 3, ≥ 4) 
o  Time from most recent prior regimen to first dose of nivolumab (< 3 months, 3 - 6 
months, > 6 months) 
o  Time from date of progression on most recent prior regimen to first dose of nivolumab 
(< 3 months, 3 - 6 months, > 6 months) 
•  Secondary endpoints: 
o  ORR assessed by the BICR: similar analyses as the primary endpoint were 
performed for the BICR-assessed ORR.  
o  DCR assessed by the investigator and the BICR will also be reported, defined as the 
number of subjects with a BOR of confirmed CR or PR or SD lasting, at least, 12 weeks 
divided by the number of treated subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 86/175 
 
 
 
• 
Exploratory endpoints:  
o  Safety: frequency of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and specific lab 
abnormalities, graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
o  PFS based on investigator and BICR assessments: time from first dosing date to the 
date of the first documented progression, as determined per RECIST 1.1, or death due 
to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
o  OS: time from first dosing date to the date of death. 
o  Serum ADA and neutralizing ADA response to nivolumab. 
o  Association between baseline PD-L1 expression and safety (AEs) and efficacy (OS, PFS, 
ORR) for the subgroups: 
 
 
Each PD-L1 status subgroup by 1 and 5% cut off 
PD-L1 indeterminate, not evaluable or missing subgroup 
o  MSI discordance: the discordance rate between repeat MSI testing and prior MSI 
testing was summarized. 
o  PRO: QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D. 
PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumor cells with membrane staining in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumour cells per Dako PD-L1 IHC assay (quantifiable PD-L1 expression). Non-
quantifiable PD-L1 expression could exist due to the biology of the tumour tissue sample, improper 
sample preparation or handling, or simply no sample. PD-L1 status is a dichotomized variable by 1% 
or 5% cut off for quantifiable PD-L1 expression. Values above or equal to the cut off were referred to 
as PD-L1 positive and values below the cut off were referred to as PD-L1 as negative, respectively. 
Sample size 
This study consists of 5 cohorts. For the MSI-H cohort (C1 and C2), a Simon optimal two-stage design 
will be used to test the null hypothesis that the true ORR is ≥ 30% (not considered clinically 
compelling) with either nivolumab monotherapy (C1) or the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab 
(C2). In the first stage (mStage 1), 19 subjects will be treated with nivolumab monotherapy. If there 
are 2 or fewer responses in these first 19 treated subjects, the protocol will be closed to further 
enrolment. If there are more than 2 but less than 7 responses in the first 19 treated subjects, accrual 
to the monotherapy arm will be stopped, and the combination arm will be opened for accrual. 
Otherwise, if there are 7 or more responses in the first 19 treated subjects, approximately 29 
additional subjects will be accrued to the monotherapy arm (mStage 2) to target a total of 48 treated 
subjects. If accrual to the combination arm is opened to the MSI-H cohort as specified above, stage I 
of the Simon two-stage design will be initiated in the combination arm with 19 treated subjects 
(cStage 1). If there are 6 or fewer responses in these first 19 treated subjects, accrual to the 
combination arm will be stopped. Otherwise, approximately 29 additional subjects will be accrued to 
the combination arm (cStage 2) to target a total of 48 subjects treated with combination therapy. 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if 20 or more responses are observed in 48 treated subjects in the 
open arm (nivolumab monotherapy and/or nivolumab/ipilimumab combination). Within a given 
treatment arm, this design yields a one-sided type I error rate of 5% and power of 90% when the true 
response rate is 52%.

EMA/314215/2021  
Page 87/175 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
For nivolumab monotherapy (C1) and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (C2) cohorts, the 
subject number will be assigned through an interactive voice response system (IVRS) once the subject 
has signed the informed consent form and is registered. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. However, as secondary objectives, the assessment of response and 
disease progression, for the primary analysis, was determined by an independent radiology review 
committee (BICR). 
Statistical methods 
For each treatment arm in the MSI-H cohort (mStage 1 monotherapy and combination therapy, if 
applicable), one interim analysis of investigator-assessed ORR will be performed on the first 19 treated 
subjects with confirmed MSI-H CRC. If there are 6 or fewer responses in these first 19 treated 
subjects, accrual to the corresponding treatment arm will be stopped. Otherwise, approximately 29 
additional confirmed MSI-H subjects will be accrued into the corresponding treatment arm to target a 
total of 48 treated subjects in that arm.  
The interim analysis will be performed when all the subjects in nivolumab monotherapy stage 1 
(mStage 1) or in combination with ipilimumab stage 1 (cStage 1) complete 24-week follow-up for an 
assessment of ORR. 
The timing of final analysis of either monotherapy or combination therapy will be after a minimum 6 
months of follow-up after the last enrolled subject’s first dose of study therapy. 
In addition, other interim analyses may be conducted to seek initial efficacy signal or for external data 
disclosure for these cohorts. 
C1 mStage 1 had the first patient first treatment (FPFT) on 01 May 2014. Following the initial 2 stage 
design of the protocol, the number of confirmed responses per investigator assessment in the first 19 
subjects of the monotherapy cohort with centrally-confirmed MSI-H was evaluated. At that time (in 
May-2015), among these 19 centrally-confirmed MSI-H subjects, the number of confirmed responders 
was 4 and 2 additional subjects who had not yet reached the week 24 time point had a best response 
of SD. Therefore, the maximum number of subjects who would demonstrate a best overall response of 
a partial response or better was estimated to be 6 subjects. This did not account for the remainder of 
the subjects who had sustained SD at that time and might have had the potential to become 
responders as was later observed. Per the protocol, if the ORR was 3-6 out of the first 19 centrally-
confirmed MSI-H subjects in C1 mStage 1, then this cohort would close, and C2 cStage 1 would open. 
Following this, enrolment in C2 cStage 1 was initiated and FPFT took place on 29-May-2015. 
Later evaluation of C1 mStage 1 revealed 7 confirmed responders in the monotherapy cohort, 
including 4 prior confirmed responders and 2 potential responders later became confirmed responders, 
plus 1 late responder (at week 60 tumour assessment); therefore, the original protocol criteria for 
progressing to C1 mStage 2 was reached. As a result, the monotherapy cohort was opened for accrual 
in C1 mStage 2 (on 30 Oct 2015) after enrolment of C2 cStage 1 was completed. 
Enrolment in C2 cStage 1 took place from May to Oct-2015, and a total of 27 subjects received the 
investigational product. Of these, 20 were assessed as being MSI-H by the central laboratory. On 18-
Feb-2016, confirmation of response in ≥ 7 of the first 19 subjects who had been assessed as MSI-H by 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 88/175 
 
 
 
the central laboratory in C2 cStage1 was reached and therefore, C2 cStage 2 was opened for 
enrolment on 19-Feb-2016 after closure of enrolment of C1 mStage 2. The enrolment in C1 and C2 
opened sequentially as described above and the two cohorts were in fact conducted independently, 
each following the protocol-described Simon optimal 2-stage design. 
Primary endpoint (investigator-assessed) 
The investigator-assessed ORR will be summarized for each cohort by treatment (monotherapy and 
combination therapy, if applicable). A response rate estimate and corresponding two-sided 95% exact 
CI will be provided using the method of Clopper-Pearson. For the reporting following a 2-stage design, 
the method proposed by Atkinson and Brown will be used to estimate a 90% CI. This confidence 
interval takes into account the group sequential nature of the two-stage Simon design. ORR will be 
further characterized by the duration of response (DOR) and rate of complete response (CR). DOR will 
be summarized for subjects who achieve confirmed PR or CR using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-
limit method. Median values of DOR, along with two-sided 95% CI (based on the log-log 
transformation), will also be calculated. Investigator-assessed CR will be summarized for each cohort 
by treatment (monotherapy and combination therapy, if applicable). An estimate of complete response 
rate (CRR) and corresponding two-sided 95% exact CI will be provided using Clopper-Pearson method. 
Sensitivity analyses 
As sensitivity analysis, a summary of investigator-assessed ORR based on response evaluable subjects 
instead of all treated subjects will also be presented.  
Another sensitivity analysis will consider a summary of ORR using a classification according to the 
repeated evaluation performed by a central laboratory.  
The following subject-level graphics will also be provided:  
For All Treated Subjects, time courses of the following events of interest will be graphically displayed 
(investigator assessed): first tumour response, tumour progression, last dose received, and death.  
For response evaluable subjects, a waterfall plot showing the best reduction from baseline in target 
lesion based on Investigator assessment will be produced (excluding assessments after PD and 
assessments after start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy).

A total of 119 subjects were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, 
82 of whom had received prior treatment with 5FU-Oxa-Iri. At the cut-off date (18-Aug-2017), 75 
(63%) subjects were still on treatment of which 53 (64.6%) subjects treated with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri; at 
the time of the Feb-2019 DBL, there were 51 (42.9%) of all treated subjects of which 36 (43.9%)  
subjects treated with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri that were still receiving treatment.  
At the time of the initial interim analysis, 44 (37%) subjects had discontinued treatment and 29 
(35.4%) subjects treated with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. The most common reason for discontinuing treatment 
in both groups was disease progression (23 [19.3%] of all treated subjects and 16 [19.5%] of the 
5FU-Oxa-Iri group).  In the later Feb 2019 DBL, there were 24 additional subjects (17 with prior 5FU 
Oxa Iri treatment) that discontinued compared with the Aug 2017 DBL. Of these 24 additional subjects 
that discontinued treatment between the Feb 2019 and Aug 2017 DBLs, the reasons were: disease 
progression (10 subjects), maximum clinical benefit (7 subjects), subject request to discontinue study 
treatment (5 subjects), study drug toxicity (1 subject), and “other” (1 subject). 
Updated efficacy analyses based on a later DBL (Oct-2020) were provided, with a minimum follow up 
of 46.9 months. At that time, 14 subjects were still on treatment.

Recruitment 
The enrolment period into the combination cohort (for MSI-H subjects who have been previously 
treated) lasted approximately 15 months (May-2015 to Oct-2015 for C2 cStage 1 and Feb-2016 to 
Aug-2016 for C2 cStage 2). The study was conducted at 31 sites in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, 
Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the United States of America).  
The primary DBL for the combination cohort occurred on 18-Aug-2017 and an updated DBL occurred 
on 19-Feb-2019. The Feb-2019 DBL, provides an overall minimum follow-up of 27.5 months for 
subjects enrolled and treated in Cohort 2 of CA209142.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 18-Nov-2013. Six global amendments and 3 country-
specific amendments were issued for this study. More cohorts were added to CA209142 study over 
time by these amendments to evaluate treatment options that were not related to the current 
submission.

Revised Protocol 01 
Based on a request from health authorities, subject eligibility 
0 
(Amendment 01) / 
criteria were revised to specify a washout period from prior 
06-Feb-2014 
therapy and which baseline toxicities from prior 
chemotherapy are allowed. Additional exclusion criteria were 
added to address this request. Other minor details were 
modified to increase comprehensibility. 
Revised Protocol 01a 
Based on a request from the French health authority, a 
0 
(Amendment 02) / 
urinalysis per local standard of care (including testing for 
01-Apr-2014 
proteinuria and evaluation of urine sediment by urine test 
strip) was added to the time and events schedule prior to 
first dose of study drug. In addition, Appendix 01 of the 
protocol was replaced with the most current version of 
Adverse Event Management Algorithms.  
Revised Protocol 02 
This global amendment was written primarily to be consistent 
35 
(Amendment 03) / 
with other protocols within the nivolumab program regarding 
23-Apr-2014 
Adverse Event Management Algorithms. Accordingly, the

Revised Protocol 04 
The main purpose of this amendment is to add a cohort of 
Completed 
(Amendment 05)/  
subjects who have had no prior treatment of their metastatic 
10-Aug-2016 
CRC. Subjects in this cohort, C3 Cohort, are to be treated 
with nivolumab + ipilimumab. MSI Status determination was 
further defined. Other minor details were modified to increase 
comprehensibility. 
Revised Protocol 04a 
The purpose of this site-specific amendment is to add cohort 
Completed 
(Amendment 06) /  
C4 to the study. The C4 Cohort consists of subjects with non-
11-Aug-2016 
MSI-H mCRC who are to be treated with nivolumab + 
ipilimumab + cobimetinib. 
Revised Protocol 04b 
This site-specific amendment was primarily written to ensure 
Completed 
(Amendment 07) /  
safety monitoring for subjects receiving cobimetinib 
18-Nov-2016 
(COTELLIC) as outlined in the prescribing information. Entry 
criteria and safety assessments were added to rule-out 
subjects with, and to monitor for, serous retinopathy, retinal 
vein occlusion, and rhabdomyolysis. 
Revised Protocol 05 
The main purpose of this amendment is to add two treatment

arms, consisting of nivolumab combined with an anti-LAG3 
 28-Nov-2016 
agent (BMS-986016) and nivolumab combined with 
daratumumab. 
Revised Protocol 06 
This purpose of this amendment is to add information to 
Completed 
and Revised Protocol 
change the dose of BMS-986016 in Cohort C5, to align with 
04c (Amendment 09) 
the daratumumab program standards, and to add clarity to

Protocol deviations 
After review of the reported protocol deviations, it was determined that there was no impact on the 
interpretability of study results. 
Relevant protocol deviations (significant protocol deviations that were programmable and could 
potentially affect the interpretability of study results) were reported in 1 (0.8%) of all combination 
treated subjects. Relevant protocol deviations were predefined in the SAP. There were no relevant 
Assessment report

protocol deviations at study entry. The only relevant protocol deviation during the treatment 
period was prohibited anti-cancer therapy: one subject with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri treatment received 
bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Medical history 
Among all combination treated subjects, abnormal physical examination findings were reported at 
baseline for 37.8% of subjects. The most frequent body systems with abnormal physical exam findings 
at baseline were abdomen (15.1%), and skin and musculoskeletal (both at 8.4%). 
Among those subjects previously treated with 5FU-Oxa-Iri, abnormal physical examination findings 
were reported at baseline for 35.4% of subjects. The most frequent body systems with abnormal 
physical exam findings at baseline were abdomen (18.3%), extremities (8.5%) and skin and 
musculoskeletal (both at 7.3%).  
In all combination treated subjects, the most frequent (> 10%) pre-treatment events were abdominal 
pain (18.5%), back pain (14.3%), diarrhea (11.8%), constipation (10.9%) and anaemia (10.9%). 
Previous treatments 
The majority of all combination treated subjects (76.5%) and as well as those subjects receiving prior 
5FU-Oxa-Iri (98.8%), received 2 or more prior lines or regimens of systemic cancer therapy.

Prior cancer therapies for the current Feb-2019 DBL were similar to the results from the previous DBL 
(Aug-2017). There were 82 subjects that were still reported as having received prior 5-fluorouracil-
irinotecan-oxaliplatin (5FU-Oxa-Iri). 
Numbers analysed 
The all combination treated population, which includes a subpopulation of subjects who had received 
prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri, was the primary population used for efficacy and safety analyses.

All BICR Response Evaluable Subjects: All Combination Treated 
Subjects who have baseline and at least one on-study evaluable tumour 
measurement per BICR. 
All Investigator Response Evaluable Subjects: All Combination Treated 
Subjects who have baseline and at least one on-study evaluable tumour 
measurement per investigator. 
All Immunogenicity Subjects: All nivolumab + ipilimumab-treated 
subjects with baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment for ADA. 
All PD-L1 Evaluable Subjects: All Combination Treated Subjects with 
quantifiable baseline PD-L1 expression. 
Modified population: all combination treated subjects excluding those 
who had not received previous treatment in the metastatic setting

Outcomes and estimation 
Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab demonstrated improved ORRs per investigator and per BICR 
in subjects with recurrent or metastatic dMMR/MSI-H CRC who had progression during or after, or 
have been intolerant to ≥ 1 line of treatment(s) for their metastatic disease. Efficacy endpoints related 
to tumour response were assessed by the investigator and the BICR based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
Primary Endpoint 
Investigator-assessed ORR 
The primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR required confirmation of response at least 4 weeks 
after the first scan showing response in accordance with RECIST 1.1. 
The investigator-assessed ORR using RECIST 1.1 are reported in table 24.

investigator were 76.8% and 71.1%, respectively. Similar rates were observed for subjects with prior 
5FU-Oxa-Iri (78.9% and 72.2%, respectively). 
86 (72.3%) all combination treated subjects and 60 (73.2%) subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri were 
censored. 86 (72.3%) and 60 (73.2%) subjects had their PFS time censored on the date of last on-
study tumour assessment, respectively. The most common reason for censoring among these subjects 
was ‘still on treatment’.

BICR-assessed PFS 
The median PFS per BICR was not reached in all combination treated subjects and subjects with prior 
5FU-Oxa-Iri. For all combination treated subjects the 6 month and 12-month PFS rates per investigator 
were 74.1% and 68.0%, respectively. Similar rates were observed for subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri 
(75.9% and 68.8%, respectively). 
81 (68.1%) all combination treated subjects and 56 (68.3%) subjects with prior 5FU Oxa-Iri were 
censored. 79 (66.4%) and 54 (65.9%) subjects had their PFS time censored on the date of last on-
study tumour assessment, respectively. The most common reason for censoring among these subjects 
was ‘still on treatment’.

Overall Survival 
Median OS for all combination treated subjects or subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri has not yet been 
reached (Table 31).  
At the time of the DBL, among all combination treated subjects, 96 (80.7%) were censored . Among 
those censored, 75 (63.0%) subjects were still on treatment (71 [59.7%] subjects had not 
progressed), and 21 (17.6%) subjects were in follow up. 
68 (82.9%) subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri were censored, of which 53 (64.6%) were still on 
treatment (50 [61.0%] subjects had not progressed), and 15 (18.3) subjects were in follow-up. No 
subjects were off-study in either group.

Follow-up for OS 
Median follow-up for OS (time between first dose date and last known date alive or death) was 12.94 
months (range: 0.1 to 26.1 months) among all combination treated subjects and 13.11 months 
(range: 0.1 to 26.1 months) in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri.  
Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of subjects; 106 (89.1%) all combination treated 
subjects and 70 (85.4%) subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri either died or had a last known alive date on 
or after the last patient last visit date (clinical cut-off date of 06-Jul-2017) for the CSR.

CA209142 efficacy data from the Feb-2019 DBL (clinical cutoff 7-Jan-2019) with a minimum follow-up 
of 27.5 months (median follow up of 31.5 months) supported the clinical benefit of nivolumab + 
ipilimumab combination therapy in subjects with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC who have been previously 
treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. 
From the original 58 responders in the Aug-2017 DBL, an efficacy summary of 57 subjects is presented 
below, as one subject was no longer evaluated as a responder. Additionally, 14 subjects achieved 
response per BICR during this period.

In the Feb-2019 DBL, median TTR was 3.22 months for all subjects and was 3.86 months in subjects 
with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. In the Aug-2017 DBL, median TTR was 2.76 months for all subjects and was 
3.33 months for subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. In the Feb-2019 DBL, median DOR was not reached 
for the all treated subjects group, and median DOR was 33.38 months (95%CI: 30.03, NA) in the prior 
5FU-Oxa-Iri group. The majority of responders (69.0%, 49/71) had ongoing response at the clinical 
cut-off date (07-Jan-2019).

ORR by Subgroups 
Analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints of ORR were repeated in subgroups of interest. 
ORR by KRAS/BRAF Mutation Status 
• In subjects who had KRAS/BRAF WT the ORR for all combination treated subjects and 
subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri was 58.1% (18/31) and 47.6% (10/21), respectively, at the Feb 2019 
DBL, similar to 51.6% (16/31) and 42.9% (9/21), respectively, at the Aug-2017 DBL.  
• In subjects who had KRAS mutation, the ORR for all combination treated subjects and 
subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri was 56.8% (25/44) and 55.3% (21/38), respectively, at the Feb 2019 
DBL, similar to 45.5% (20/44) and 44.7% (17/38), respectively at the Aug-2017 DBL.  
• In subjects who had BRAF mutation, the ORR for all combination treated subjects and 
subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri was 66.7% (20/30) and 68.8% (11/16), respectively, at the Feb-2019 
DBL and was 51.7% (15/29) and 56.3% (9/16), respectively, at the Aug-2017 DBL. 
ORR by Lynch Syndrome 
  ORR per BICR: 
o 
o 
o 
In all combination treated subjects with Lynch Syndrome (n = 35), the ORR was 62.9% 
(95% CI: 44.9, 78.5).  
In  all  combination  treated  subjects  without  Lynch  Syndrome  (n  =  35),  the  ORR  was 
60.0% (95% CI: 42.1, 76.1). 
In all combination treated subjects with unknown Lynch Syndrome status (n = 49), the 
ORR was 57.1% (95% CI: 42.2, 71.2). 
  ORR per investigator: 
o 
o 
In all combination treated subjects with Lynch Syndrome (n = 35), the ORR was 77.1% 
(95% CI: 59.9, 89.6).  
In  all  combination  treated  subjects  without  Lynch  Syndrome  (n  =  35),  the  ORR  was 
57.1% (95% CI: 39.4, 73.7). 
In all combination treated subjects with unknown Lynch Syndrome status (n = 49), the ORR was 51.0% 
(95% CI: 36.3, 65.6). 
ORR by Time from Progression on Most Recent Prior Therapy to Treatment 
BICR-  and  investigator-assessed  ORR  by  time  from  progression  on  most  recent  prior  therapy  to 
treatment in all combination treated subjects were similar: 
• 
In subjects who started treatment in < 3 months, the ORR was 57.1% (48/84) and 56.0% 
(47/84), respectively 
• 
In  subjects  who  started  treatment  in  3-6  months,  the  ORR  was  63.6%  (7/11)  and  90.9% 
(10/11), 
respectively 
• 
In subjects who started treatment in > 6 months, the ORR was 50.0% (4/8) and 50.0% (4/8), 
respectively 
ORR by Subjects Enrolled and Treated in cStage 1 or cStage 2 
Considering the subgroups of subjects enrolled and treated in cStage 1 or in cStage 2, ORR per BICR 
were numerically lower for subjects enrolled and treated in cStage 1 (ORR of 48.1% [13/27], 95% CI 
[28.7, 68.1]) as compared to subjects enrolled and treated in cStage 2 (63.0% [58/92], 95% CI [52.3, 
72.9]). However, the related CIs are overlapping.

PFS 
Regarding PFS, there were 10 new events of progression in the Feb-2019 DBL compared to the Aug-
2017 DBL. The median PFS per BICR was 36.0 months (95% CI: 27.9, NA) in all treated subjects and 
was 36.0 months (95% CI: 27.4, NA) in prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri combination treated subjects. For all 
combination treated subjects the 12- and 24-month PFS rates per BICR were 69.8% and 63.5%, 
respectively. Similar rates were observed for prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri combination treated subjects (69.7% 
and 63.0%, respectively). 
There were 71 (59.7%) of all combination treated subjects and 47 (57.3%) of prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri 
combination treated subjects that were censored as of the Feb-2019 DBL. There were 69 (58.0%) of 
all combination treated subjects and 45 (54.9%) of prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri combination treated subjects that 
had their PFS time censored on the date of last on-study tumour assessment. The most common 
reason for censoring among these subjects was ‘still on treatment’. 
OS 
Per the Feb-2019 DBL, median OS for all combination treated subjects or prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri 
combination treated subjects has not yet been reached, with 10 additional events compared with the 
Aug-2017 DBL; in total 33 events occurred in 119 subjects (27.7%) and 22 events occurred in 82 
(26.8%) subjects, respectively. For all combination treated subjects the 12- and 24-month OS rates 
were 84.9% and 74.8%, respectively. Similar rates were observed for prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri combination 
treated subjects (the 12- and 24-month OS rates were 87.8% and 75.6%, respectively). 
At the time of the Feb-2019 DBL among all combination treated subjects, 86 (72.3%) subjects were 
censored and 60 (73.2%) of prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri subjects were censored. Among all treated subjects that 
were censored, 51 (42.9 %) subjects were still on treatment (43 [36.1%] subjects had not 
progressed), and 34 (28.6%) subjects were in follow-up. Among subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri 
treatment that were censored, 36 (43.9%) were still on treatment (30 [36.6%] subjects had not 
progressed), and 23 (28.0%) were in follow-up. 
Median follow-up for OS was 30.65 months (range: 0.1 to 44.2 months) among all combination treated 
subjects and 30.98 months (range: 0.1 to 44.2 months) in prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri combination treated 
subjects.

Latest efficacy results (DBL Oct-2020) 
Updated efficacy analyses were provided based on a later cut-off date (Oct-2020) with a minimum 
follow up of 46.9 months and a median follow-up of 51.1 months. These analyses were originally 
performed in the known as “modified population” (n=109) where 10 subjects were excluded due to not 
having received previous treatment in the metastatic setting, from the not prior 5Fu-Oxa-Iri subjects 
dataset (N=27). Data in the ‘all treated population’ (N=119), 3L (N=82) and all 2L subjects (N=37) 
were also provided.  
The investigator assessed-ORR and DOR are summarized in table 9. Regarding secondary endpoint, 
ORR by BICR, results were similar and are presented in table 34.

•  Concordance between Local MSI Testing and Central MSI Testing 
By the initial DBL (18 Aug 2017), out of the 119 subjects, 62 had confirmed MSI H by a central test. 
An additional 30 subjects had missing central testing data due to inadequate amount of tumor tissue 
and/or no viable tumour in the sample to be centrally tested. The remaining 27 subjects had central 
test results that did not match the local testing.

Concordance rate of responders was 69.7% in all subjects (n=119) and 65.0% in subjects with prior 
5Fu-Oxa-Iri (n=82). 
Focusing on updated efficacy data (DBL 19 Feb-2019), out of the 119 subjects, 70 had confirmed MSI-
H by a central test, known as centrally confirmed MSI-H population, as defined in the study protocol. 
An additional 28 subjects had central test results that did not match the local testing. The remaining 
21 subjects had missing central testing data due to inadequate amount of tumour tissue and/or no 
viable tumour in the sample to be centrally tested. 
•  ORR and DCR: BICR-assessed ORR was 64.3% (45/70) and investigator-assessed ORR was 
65.7% (46/70). The BICR-assessed DCR was 84.3% and investigator-assessed DCR was 
80.0%. These results were similar to the overall population evaluated by the local laboratories 
as dMMR or MSI-H. 
•  BICR-assessed median PFS was not reached in all central lab confirmed combination therapy 
treated subjects. The investigator-assessed median PFS was 41.59 months.

•  Sensitivity Analyses of ORR (DBL 19 Feb 2019) 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the robustness of the results of 
the primary analysis of ORR and the impact of the changes in the sample size and the primary analysis 
method. 
1) The first 19 subjects in C2 cStage 1 and the first 29 subjects in C2 cStage 2 who had been 
identified as MSI-H by the central laboratory (i.e., the first 48 subjects identified as MSI-H by the 
central laboratory) were analysed on the assumption that the study had been conducted in accordance 
with the study protocol. The SAP version 2.0 Clopper and Pearson method and the protocol-specified 
Atkinson and Brown method were used in these analyses. 
2) Analysis were performed based on the total of 70 subjects identified as being MSI-H by the 
central laboratory. The Clopper and Pearson method and the Koyama and Chen method were used in 
these analyses. In the Koyama and Chen method, the analysis was adjusted for the actually increased 
sample size in the Simon 2-stage design. 
These results are summarised in the following table.

A sensitivity analysis accounting for the two independent 2-stage designs that were conducted is also 
provided. This analysis is considering a correction to the overall alpha level according to Bonferroni. In 
that approach, the original 0.05 alpha level (corresponding to a 95% CI) is divided by two (for the two 
independent designs), resulting into a 0.025 alpha level (corresponding to a 97.5% CI). That 
correction was used to rectify the CI for all the key efficacy results (ORR, PFS and OS). 
CIs resulting from this correction were all consistent with the ones from the original analyses and 
specifically from the primary efficacy analysis.

•  Baseline PD-L1 Expression and Efficacy - Exploratory Endpoint 
Subjects were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 expression status; however, pre-study (baseline) tumour 
tissue specimens were systematically collected in order to conduct pre-planned analyses of efficacy 
and safety according to PD-L1 expression status. Subjects were required to submit an archived tumour 
sample or, if not available, a pre-treatment fresh biopsy sample. Tumour tissue must have been 
obtained from an unresectable site of disease or from a site of metastatic disease. The presence of a 
biopsy specimen was an inclusion criterion and hence a prerequisite for full eligibility of a subject. 
Tumour tissue samples were tested for PD-L1 expression using the Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx 
test. 
As of the 18 Aug 2017 DBL, the majority (85.7%) of subjects had PD-L1 tested at baseline and of 
these, most (89.2%) had quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline. 11 (10.8%) subjects did not have 
quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline (including PD-L1 tumour sample PD L1 not evaluable). No 
subjects had indeterminate PD-L1 expression at baseline. 
As of the 19 Feb 2019 DBL, the majority (95.0%) of subjects had PD-L1 tested at baseline and of 
these, most (90.3%) had quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline. 9.7% of subjects did not have 
quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline (including subjects without baseline tumour sample and PD-
L1 not evaluable). No subjects had indeterminate PD-L1 expression at baseline.

Supportive study 
Study CA2097XM 
The MAH conducted a retrospective cohort study (CA2097XM) using the Flatiron electronic health 
record (EHR) database from Jan-2013 through Apr-2020 to assess OS and time to next treatment 
(TTNT) among 2L and 3L patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC on standard of care treatment, 
respectively. While OS data (date of death) is very complete in the Flatiron dataset, there are no 
recordings of PFS available at this time for the mCRC patient population. Thus, TTNT was used as a 
surrogate for PFS. TTNT is defined as the period of time from the initial line of therapy to a subsequent 
line of therapy.   
A matched cohort of patients with dMMR or MSI-H stage IV or recurrent mCRC treated with systemic 
therapy were identified in Flatiron using the eligibility criteria from CA209142.  
Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate median OS, TTNT, and their associated 95% confidence 
intervals, respectively. For both OS and TTNT, patients were followed from initiation of 2L or 3L 
systemic treatment until the event of interest, censoring, or death. Censoring events were loss to 
follow-up, end of study period, and use of immunotherapy in later-line therapy.  
Seventy-eight patients met inclusion criteria on 2L and 26 patients met inclusion criteria on 3L and 
were compared in terms of baseline demographics and clinical characteristics to the 37 and 82 patients 
from study CA209142 respectively.  
Median OS and TTNT for CA2097XM patients on 2L were 15.3 months (95% CI: 11.1, 22.4) and 6.5 
months (95% CI: 5.1, 8.1), respectively. Median OS and TTNT for CA2097XM patients on 3L were 14.8 
months (95% CI: 5.1, 28.7) and 5.1 months (95% CI: 3.3, 7.0), respectively Median OS and PFS per 
BICR for CA209142 patients without prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri had not been reached. For CA209142 patients 
with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri, median OS had not been reached and median PFS per BICR was 36.0 months 
(95% CI: 27.4, NA). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The data submitted to support this new indication is based on the results of the cohort 2 (combination 
therapy) (cStage1 and cStage2) from Study CA209142 (Checkmate 142). This is an open-label, multi-
centre, 2-stage Simon design study of nivolumab monotherapy (mStage) or in combination with 
ipilimumab (cStage) to estimate the response rate in MSI-H/dMMR mCRC.  
It is noted that, in the context of this new application data from cohort 1 (nivolumab monotherapy 
cohort) are submitted mainly to justify the contribution of the mono-components in the proposed 
combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab. No indication for nivolumab in monotherapy in the intended 
disease setting is currently sought. 
The sample size has been arranged according to the Simon’s Two-Stage design (optimal). The 
assumptions and the number of subjects for each stage are endorsed. A total of 119 subjects were 
enrolled in cohort 2 treatment period, 82 of whom had received prior treatment with 5FU-Oxa-Iri. 
There were also 23 non MSI-H subjects that were also treated with nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab (not included in this report). The MAH has provided results based on the 18-Aug-2017 
Assessment report

Page 129/175 
 
 
 
 
clinical database lock (DBL) as well as updated efficacy data based on a later DBL (19-Feb-2019) and 
results for the main endpoints based on the latest DBL (Oct-2020). 
The main limitation of the pivotal study submitted is the lack of a control arm, which hampers the 
interpretation of the reported results. In order to address these uncertainties and to further 
contextualise results from study CA209142, the MAH has provided results from a retrospective study 
(Study CA2097XM) based on real word data from the Flatiron database in MSI-H mCRC treated with 
SOC. However, ORR data are not available in this dataset which is a major limitation, i.e. data outputs 
from the study CA2097XM are mainly TTNT (as proxy for PFS) and OS that renders any comparison 
with data from study CA209142 of very limited value as for the challenging interpretation of time to 
event endpoints in the context of uncontrolled trials. Given the absence of an appropriate historical 
control, the MAH was asked to provide additional within-patient analyses to better understand the 
clinical relevance of the study results. The MAH was requested to provide results showing PFS on 
nivolumab/ipilimumab in relation to time to progression on previous therapy(ies) in the metastatic 
setting for each patient and statistically test this  as well as for ORR. Furthermore, within-patient 
analyses of ORR per line of treatment were submitted. Overall, no correlation was observed between 
PFS and ORR to previous treatment and to the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab. In fact, with 
regards to ORR, a high number of non-responders to most recent prior therapy did respond to 
nivolumab+ipilimumab treatment. It should be taken into account that for the overall population, there 
were missing data (i.e. 16 patients had missing TTP prior values and 29 patients had missing value for 
best response to most recent prior therapy). These patients were excluded from the analyses, i.e. no 
imputation of missing data was done. These analyses were also performed for 2L and 3L patients, 
separately and similar results were observed. 
By protocol amendment 04 (Revised Protocol 03), the enrolment was chosen to be done by MSI-
H/MMR per local lab instead of central lab due to difficulties in getting the results in time, which led to 
delays in the study. Previously, an over-enrolment of the Stage 2 had been decided in order to 
compensate for these delays in getting the central lab confirmed status for dMMR/MSI-H. SAP v. 2.0 
(dated 30-Aug-2016) included these already mentioned changes on the primary analysis population. 
Moreover, a change in the methodology to estimate the CI of the primary endpoint was performed 
(from Atkinsons & Brown method to a Clopper-Pearson method). The latter was incorporated with SAP 
v.3.0 (dated 20 Jul 2017). Several sensitivity analyses have been provided to further assess the 
robustness of the results and the impact of these changes. Overall, results were consistent with the 
primary analysis.  
As stated above, the MSI status of the study population was determined by local tests on either MSI or 
MMR deficiency by an accredited laboratory per local regulations (local lab). Samples with instability in 
2 or more of these markers were defined as MSI-H, whereas those with one unstable marker were 
designated as MSI-Low (MSI-L). Samples with no detectable alterations were microsatellite stable 
(MSI-S, or MSS). However, when more than 5 loci are analysed, MSI-H tumours are defined as having 
instability in ≥ 30-40% markers, while MSI-L tumours are defined as having instability in < 30-40% 
markers. In both cases, MSI-S is defined as having no instability detected in any of the markers. Of 
the 119 patients in cohort 2, 118 (99.2%) were MSI-H by local testing and 1 patient was classified as 
MSI-H/MSI-S. The method used were in most cases IHC (44.5%) and PCR (36.15). MSI-H was 
centrally confirmed in 62 (52.1%) patients, with a concordance rate of 69.7%. There were 27 (22.7%) 
patients classified as non-MSI-H and 30 (25.2%) patients for whom central testing was not reported 
due to inadequate amount of tissue and/or viable tumour. At the Feb 2019 DBL, the number of 
patients centrally confirmed with MSI-H mCRC was of 70 (confirmed MSI-H population).  
The enrolment of cohort 2 lasted approximately 15 months: May-2015 to Oct-2015 for cStage 1 and 
Feb-2016 to Aug-2016 for cStage 2. As the recruitment took place in two different timeframes (stage 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 130/175 
 
 
 
and 2), the MAH was required and has provided baseline characteristics separately for subjects 
included on stage 1 (n=27) and stage 2 (n=92). There were some unbalances in baseline 
characteristics between the two stages that might explain the apparently lower ORR reported in 
patients from cStage 1 compared with cStage 2 (48.1% [95%CI: 28.7, 68.1] vs. 63.0% [95%CI: 52.3, 
72.9]). The MAH was asked to further discuss these differences and whether unbalances observed in 
baseline characteristics may have contributed. In relation to this and in order to provide further 
confirmation that the observed results from study CA209142 are robust, the ORR results for the 
patients who were overenrolled in cStage1 and cStage2 (for the remaining patients with confirmed 
central testing as well as all remaining patients regardless of confirmation by central testing) were 
submitted and compared to the reported results for patients in protocol-defined cStage1 and 2. In 
addition, the DoR results for each stage (protocol-defined cStage1 [first 19 patients MSI-h CRC 
confirmed by central testing], protocol-defined cStage2 [first 29 patients with MSI-h CRC confirmed by 
central testing], and the remaining patients) were included. No clear trend in the mentioned 
unbalances has been observed in relation to possible worse prognostic factors and the differences 
observed in ORR may be due to the small size of cStage 1. 
The primary DBL for the combination cohort occurred on 18-Aug-2017, with a minimum follow-up of 9 
months. A later DBL was performed on 19-Feb-2019, with a minimum follow-up of 27.5 months. An 
updated efficacy analysis was performed based on the latest DBL (Oct-2020) upon request, with a 
minimum follow-up of 46.9 months. 
Among combination treated subjects, the baselines seems balanced and overall, subjects included 
seem to be representative of the target population. 
The majority of all treated subjects (82/119, 68.9%) were generally heavily pre-treated and received 
prior systemic cancer therapies that included all 3 components: 5FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (5FU-
Oxa-Iri) (e.g., FOLFOX and FOLFIRI). These subjects hereafter referred to as “with 5FU-Oxa-Iri”, 
represented a third line and beyond setting (3L+). Moreover, 57.1% and 29.4% of patients had 
received prior treatment with VEGF- and EGFR-inhibitors, respectively. As per inclusion criteria, 
patients must have received at least 1 prior therapy for their metastatic disease or patients had 
actively refused chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced disease. One patient 
did not receive any prior line and refused chemotherapy in order to enter the study, per inclusion 
criteria. Moreover, there were 9 patients that did not receive prior treatment in the metastatic setting. 
They received oxaliplatin in the (neo)-adjuvant setting and progressed during or within 6 months of 
completion of the adjuvant therapy. It was questioned that those patients pertained to a different 
treatment setting and as a consequence the updated efficacy analysis (DBL Oct-2020) excluded all 
patients who had not received prior fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting in 
cohort 2, i.e. 10 patients. It is however recognised that in clinical practice patients progressing on or 
within 6 months of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting are considered 
as having been treated with first-line (1L) chemotherapy. In this regard it is noted that in fact these 
patients are normally excluded from clinical studies that enrol 1L patients. ‘All Combination Treated 
Subjects’ population (n=119) have been the one used for efficacy inference and analysis/data 
corresponding to that population is included in the SmPC. With this in mind the efficacy analysis / 
summary of efficacy results for the Oct 2020 DBL was updated to include data for all subjects in the 
‘without 5FU-Oxa-Iri’ population recruited according to the protocol, i.e. 37 patients and, in the same 
way, efficacy results for ‘all prior 5Fu-Oxa-Iri subjects’ (N=82). Data from the ‘all treated’ population 
(n=119) had already been submitted.  
In the majority of patients (70.6%), time from progression to most recent prior treatment to start 
treatment with nivolumab + ipilimumab was < 3 months. Information of the median time to disease 
progression on most recent therapy was provided.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
With a minimum follow-up of at least 9 months for the primary database lock (Aug-2017), the 
primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR by RECIST 1.1 was 54.6% (95% CI: 45.2, 63.8; 
65/119) in all combination treated subjects and 52.4% (95%CI: 41.1, 63.6; 43/82) in subjects with 
prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. The BICR-assessed ORR using RECIST 1.1 was 48.7% (95%CI: 39.5, 58.1; 58/119) 
in all combination treated subjects and 46.3% (95%CI: 35.3, 57.7; 38/82) in subjects with prior 5FU-
Oxa-Iri. Median DOR per investigator and per BICR was not reached in either subject population. 
The ORR as per investigator in MSI-H centrally confirmed patients was 54.8% (95%CI: 41.7, 67.5) in 
the overall population (n=62) and 56.4% (95%CI: 39.6, 72.2) in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri 
treatment (n=82).  
In general, subgroup analysis showed rather consistent results. Investigator-assessed ORR by 
KRAS/BRAF wild type (WT) status in all combination treated subjects was 54.8% (17/31) and 42.9% 
(9/21) in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. ORR was similar in subjects with BRAF mutation status 
(55.2% vs 56.3% in all combination treated and subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri, respectively) and 
KRAS mutation status (56.8% vs 57.9%, respectively). However, ORR appears lower in patients ≥75 
years (27.3%) and in patients with 4 or more prior therapies (36.8%). The latter is not unexpected; 
however, sample size for elderly patients is quite limited (n=11) and interpretation of efficacy results is 
difficult. This information is included in the PI. 
Investigator and BICR assessments for responders was highly concordant; 90.7% in all combination 
treated subjects and 88.9% in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. 
The median PFS per investigator was not reached in all combination treated subjects and subjects with 
prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. On the date of the last on-study tumour assessment, 86 (72.3%) and 60 (73.2%) 
subjects had their PFS time censored, respectively. The most common reason for censoring among 
these subjects was ‘still on treatment’. The median PFS per BICR was not reached in all combination 
treated subjects and subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. Seventy nine (66.4%) and 54 (65.9%) subjects 
had their PFS time censored on the date of last on-study tumour assessment, respectively. The most 
common reason for censoring among these subjects was ‘still on treatment’. 
Investigator and BICR-assessed KM PFS curves were similar for each subgroup of KRAS/BRAF mutation 
status in all combination treated subjects as well as in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. Investigator 
and BICR-assessed KM PFS curves were close for each subgroup of Lynch syndrome in all combination 
treated subjects as well as in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. Median PFS was not reached in any 
subgroup/population. 
With regard to OS, at the time of the DBL, data were still immature. Median OS has not been reached, 
neither for all combination treated subjects nor for subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri. Twenty-three 
events occurred in 119 subjects (19.3%) and 14 events in the 82 (17.1%) subjects with prior 5FU-
Oxa-Iri. At the time of the DBL, among all combination treated subjects, 96 (80.7%) were censored. 
Of those censored, 75 (63.0%) subjects were still on treatment (71 [59.7%] subjects had not 
progressed), and 21 (17.6%) subjects were in follow up. Among patients with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri, 68 
(82.9%) subjects were censored, of which 53 (64.6%) were still on treatment (50 [61.0%] subjects 
had not progressed), and 15 (18.3) subjects were in follow-up. No subjects were off-study in either 
group. Median follow-up for OS (time between first dose date and last known date alive or death) was 
12.94 months (range: 0.1 to 26.1 months) among all combination treated subjects and 13.11 months 
(range: 0.1 to 26.1 months) in subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri.  
Updated efficacy data with a later DBL (Feb-2019) were provided, with a minimum follow-up of 27.5 
months. At that time, the investigator-assessed ORR using RECIST 1.1 was 60.5% (95% CI: 51.1, 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 132/175 
 
 
 
69.3; 72/119) in dMMR or MSI-H per local lab, in all combination therapy treated subjects, with 9 CR 
(7.6%) and 63 achieved PR (52.9%). The BICR-assessed ORR using RECIST 1.1 was 59.7% (95% CI: 
50.3, 68.6; 71/119) in dMMR or MSI-H per local lab, in all combination therapy treated subjects with 
17 having achieved CR (14.3%) and 54 having achieved PR (45.4%). In the subgroup of patients 
previously treated with 5FU-Oxali-Iri the investigator-assessed ORR was 59.8% and the BIC-assessed 
ORR was 56.1%. Median DOR per BICR and investigator was not reached for the all treated subjects 
(95%CI: 30.03, NA and 34.6, NA, respectively). Median DOR in the subgroup of patients previously 
treated with 5FU-Oxali-Iri was not reached as per investigator assessment (95% CI: 34.60, NA) and 
was of 33.38 months (95%CI: 30.03, NA) according to BIRC. One subject was no longer considered as 
a responder in this data update due to a change in the assessment by a different adjudicator. 
ORR for confirmed Lynch Syndrome patients was higher: 71.4%. No differences were found between 
KRAS/BRAF WT, KRAS and BRAF mutated subjects. 
Regarding prior treatment lines, ORR was lower when advancing in treatment line: ORR of 63% for 2L 
patients, 58.1% for 3L, 51.7% for 4L and 36.8% for patients who received this combination for later 
than 4L treatment. It should be highlighted that 51.7% is a very valuable ORR for 4L patients, as 
treatment options at this point are limited and this could be a subgroup of patients who could 
considerably benefit from new treatment options. 
Comparable ORR was observed between the central lab confirmed subjects (n=70) and local lab 
confirmed subjects (n=119, shown above). For the central lab confirmed subjects, ORR was 65.7% 
(95% CI: 53.4, 76.7; 46/70) per Investigator, and 64.3% (95%CI: 51.9, 75.4) per BICR. Overall, the 
investigator-assessed and BICR-assessed ORR were comparable across baseline subgroups for all 
combination treated subjects and in line with prior data analysis.  
With regard to PFS, at the time of the DBL, the median Investigator-assessed PFS was of 41.5 months 
(95%CI: 32.8, 41.6), the same as for prior 5-Fu-Oxa-Iri treated patients. The median BICR-assessed 
PFS was of 36 months (95%CI: 27.9, N.A). However, the number of events accounted for in this 
analysis are still low (40.3% in the overall population according to BIRC and Investigator).  
At the time of the DBL median OS for all combination treated subjects had not been reached (neither 
for the subgroup of patients with prior treatment with 5FU-Oxa-Iri). A total of 33 events (27.7%) 
occurred in 119 combination treated subjects (22 [26.8%] among patients with prior treatment with 
5FU-Oxa-Iri). OS rates at 12 months, for the overall population and for the subgroup of patients with 
prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri were around 84.9% and 87.8% and at 24 months 74.8% and 75.6%, respectively.  
The reported data are considered encouraging and of particular value in patients having received prior 
treatment with 5FU-Oxa-Iri (3L+) in whom currently available systemic therapy options provide very 
limited overall clinical activity and invariably short-lived. The observed magnitude of durable tumour 
responses could be regarded as clinically relevant as it is reasonable to expect that these will translate 
into a survival benefit; though its magnitude is yet to be determined.  
Updated efficacy data from the latest DBL (Oct-2020) after approximately 20 months of additional 
follow-up was submitted for the overall population (n=119), 2L and 3L patients. The investigator 
assessed-ORR was 64.7% (95% CI: 55.4, 73.2) for all subjects who received therapy in the metastatic 
setting, 63.4% (95% CI: 52.0, 73.8) for subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri therapy (n=82) and 67.6% 
(95% CI: 50.2, 73.8) for subjects without prior 5FU Oxa-Iri therapy (n=37). These results were 
consistent with BICR-assessed ORR. Responses are durable with median duration of response not 
having been reached in either of the two subpopulations. A significant improvement was observed for 
BICR-assessed PFS (exploratory endpoint) compared to the previously reported. Up to Oct-2020, 
median PFS was 56.3 (95% CI: 30.3, N.A.) months for the total population, 56.3 (95% CI: 27.8, N.A.) 
months for the 3L population and N.R. (16.5, N.A.) for the 2L population, while mPFS was around 36

months in the previous cut-off. Regarding OS, 35 (29.4%) events occurred in the total population of 
119 patients. This represents 2 additional events with respect to the previous DBL (Feb 2019). The 
relatively low number of OS events reported after a minimum follow-up of nearly 4 years , i.e. 86 out 
of the 119 patients (72.3%) are still alive, is considered to support the clinical benefit of the 
combination in the intended treatment setting albeit the limitations of the uncontrolled nature of the 
data set. 
The benefit in the 2L was initially regarded as slightly less clear, considering that these patients still 
have some established treatment options among traditional (chemo)therapy. A discussion of the 
benefit/risk in the claimed broad indication and the 2L and ≥3L separately was requested. 
Investigator-assessed and BICR-assessed ORR results and median duration of response (not reached) 
were similar for 2L and 3L subjects based on the latest DBL, see above, and considering its magnitude 
are considered clinically meaningful also for 2L patients.  
As previously observed, an apparently lower efficacy was observed in patients ≥ 75 years and it is to 
be noted that only 11 from the 109 subjects in the modified population were 75 years or older (the 
same than in the all treated population). Up to the new DBL (Oct-2020), the BICR assessed ORR for 
these 11 subjects was 36.4% (4/11) while the ORR was 27.3% (3/11) at the initial cut-off date (Aug-
2017), therefore one more subject was considered as a responder for the updated analysis. Some 
baseline demographic and disease baseline characteristics by age categories (<75 and ≥75) have been 
analysed by the MAH to try to explain this low response rate in elderly patients. The percentage of 
subjects with right colon as primary tumour location was higher in elderly (72.7% vs. 52%), BRAF 
mutation was also more reported for elderly patients (63.6% vs. 2.4%) and more patients from this 
group were reported as MSI-S by central assessment (36.4% vs. 18.4%). Results for PFS and OS by 
these age categories have also been reported. Median PFS was 56.34 (95% CI: 30.26, N.A.) months 
for <75 years and 16.89 (95% CI: 1.31, N.A.) months for ≥75 years subjects. Due to the small sample 
size for this group (N=11), it is really difficult to reach any conclusion. This information regarding lower 
ORR for subjects ≥75 years have been included in the PI. 
In addition, as discussed above, a lower ORR was observed in patients from cStage 1 compared to 
cStage 2 (48.1% [95%CI: 28.7, 68.1] vs. 63.0% [95%CI: 52.3, 72.9]). As observed for the previous 
data cut-off (Feb-2019), in the modified population (N=109) using Oct-2020 DBL, the ORR in cStage 1 
(50.0% [95% CI: 29.9, 70.1]) (N=26) was also numerically lower than that in cStage 2 (60.2% [95% 
CI: 48.9, 70.8]) (N=83). The differences observed in ORR between patients from cStage 1 and cStage 
2 may be due to the small sample size of cStage 1. Baseline characteristics by enrollment stages were 
evaluated to further investigate this difference. Some unbalances were found between both stages: in 
cStage 1 there were fewer male subjects, more KRAS mutated patients and more 3L subjects (prior 
5Fu-Oxa-Iri) but these differences are not considered to explain the lower ORR in the cStage 1 
population. However, it is important to note that there were also differences regarding primary tumor 
location (left colon location was nearly double in cStage 2 than cStage 1 patients). Tumor location has 
been postulated as a prognostic factor in CRC. In fact, left-sided primary tumor location has been 
associated with a reduced risk of death (Petrelli F et al. JAMA Oncol; 2016). Nevertheless, since this is 
a “selected” population (i.e. patient with MSI-H/dMMR CRC) it is not clear whether a similar effect 
could be expected in this case. Overall, the MAH’s justification is acknowledged. 
The MAH was also requested to evaluate if over-enrollment and MSI-H status per central lab had any 
impact on ORR results. Excluding over-enrolled patients, the first 19 subjects enrolled in cStage 1 
appeared to have numerically lower ORR than the first 29 subjects enrolled in cStage 2 across both 
centrally-confirmed (57.9% vs. 69.0%) and locally-determined (47.4% vs. 69.0%). ORR in over-
enrolled subjects with centrally-confirmed MSI-H status (N=14) was 57.1% (95% CI: 28.9, 82.3) and 
ORR in all centrally-confirmed MSI-H subjects (N=62) was 62.9% (95% CI: 49.7, 74.8). In the same 
Assessment report

Page 134/175 
 
 
 
way, ORR in over-enrolled subjects with locally-confirmed MSI-H status (N=61) was consistent with all 
locally-determined MSI-H subjects (N=109), being 55.7% and 57.8% respectively. Overall, over-
enrollment did not seem to have had an impact on ORR results differently from the efficacy results 
obtained for centrally and locally-confirmed MSI-H status subjects, as reported in the initial 
assessment. 
In addition, as originally planned, an analysis for cohort 2 for the primary endpoint for the first 48 
centrally-confirmed MSI-H patients included was provided, while also using a Bonferroni-correction due 
to the two cohorts, i.e. using a 97.5% confidence interval and results seemed to confirm those 
observed for the overall population.  
An exploratory analysis of efficacy according to PD-L1 expression was performed. PD-L1 expression 
was not an inclusion criterion. Of the 119 patients included in Cohort 2 of the study, 102 (90.3%) had 
quantifiable PD-L1 expression (DBL 19 Feb 2019). The majority of patients had a PD-L1 expression 
<1% (73.5%). Overall, ORR results were consistent regardless of PD-L1 expression (<1% or ≥1%). 
However, response appears to be higher in patients with PD-L1 ≥5% (n=15), with an ORR of 80% as 
per investigator and 86.7% according to BIRC compared with the ORR in patients with PD-L1 <5% 
(n=87) 56.3% and 55.2%, investigator and BIRC, respectively. However, considering the exploratory 
nature of this analysis and the low number of patients with PD-L1 ≥ 5% no conclusions can be drawn.  
In order to justify the contribution of the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab over nivolumab 
monotherapy, the MAH has provided comparative efficacy data from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 of the 
CA209142 study. Overall, the ORR reached with the combination was higher than with nivolumab 
monotherapy (59.7% [95%CI: 50.3, 68.6] vs. 37.8% [95%CI: 26.8, 49.9], respectively). Median 
duration of response was not reached in either cohort. Even if any comparison between non 
randomised cohorts requires cautious interpretation and no definitive conclusions can therefore be 
drawn, the reported results appear to strongly suggest that the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab 
leads to better efficacy in the targeted patient population. 
Even if results reported in cohort 2 of the CA209142 study are considered clinically relevant, data 
cannot be regarded as comprehensive as a result of the uncontrolled nature of the study that limits 
interpretation of data. In this respect the MAH has proposed to provide results from a currently 
ongoing randomized Phase 3b trial (Study CA2098HW) as a post-authorisation measure (PAM). Results 
from this study are expected to provide replication of ORR and DOR results in the ≥2L population, and 
also randomised data to compare numerical differences between chemotherapy and nivolumab (in 
combination with ipilimumab) in the 2L setting of dMMR or MSI-H mCRC. Results from this study 
should be submitted when available in the context of a recommendation.  
The revised protocol version 03 (dated 28-Mar-2019) has been submitted as part of the documentation 
for this procedure. CA2098HW is a Phase 3, randomized, 3-arm open-label study of nivolumab 
monotherapy (Arm A), nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy (Arm B) or an investigator’s 
choice chemotherapy (Arm C) for the treatment of participants with recurrent or metastatic dMMR or 
MSI-H CRC. The trial was expanded (Revised protocol v.04, 09-Jul-2019) to include more participants 
in the 1L setting, as discussed at the SA meeting in Sep-2019 (EMEA/H/SA/3330/4/2019/II). As a 
result, the study enrolment consists of 2 sequential parts. Part 1 enrolment is open to participants 
across all lines of therapy, and Part 2 enrolment is open only to participants who have not received 
prior therapy for metastatic disease (1L). It is expected that approximately 748 participants with 
dMMR or MSI-H mCRC determined by local testing will be randomized to the study, including 
approximately 492 and 256 during Part 1 and Part 2 enrolment, respectively. Participants will be 
randomized to arms A, B or C in a 2:2:1 ratio. Randomization to Arm C will be restricted to 
participants who have received no more than 1 prior line of systemic therapy (0 or 1 line). Part 1 
enrolment continues to allow randomization of approximately 492 participants across lines of therapy

with locally determined dMMR or MSI-H mCRC as per protocol revision 3. As of 01-Jul-2020, study had 
randomized 282 participants across lines of therapy during Part 1 enrolment. The study has dual 
primary endpoints of BICR assessed PFS between Arms B and A across all randomized patients (PFS in 
all lines B vs A) and BICR assessed PFS between Arms B and C across patients who have not received 
prior therapy (PFS in 1L B vs C). The study is also powered for comparison of key secondary endpoint 
of BICR assessed PFS between Arms B and A in patients who have not received prior therapy (PFS in 
1L B vs A). Other secondary endpoints include BICR assessed ORR, safety and OS across arms. As of 
30-Nov-2020, Part 1 enrollment is complete and a total of 558 subjects with MSI-H/ dMMR mCRC 
determined by local testing were randomized as of 31-Dec-2020. Part 2 enrollment started on 01 Dec 
2020 and, as of 31-Dec-2020, 5 subjects with MSI-H/ dMMR mCRC determined by local testing have 
been randomized. Enrollment in the study is projected to be completed by 1Q 2022 and the first IA is 
projected to occur in 4Q 2022. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data supporting this variation procedure are based on the analysis of Cohort 2 (combination therapy) 
of the phase 2 uncontrolled study CA209142 in which a total of 119 dMMR/MSI-H mCRC patients 
previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy were included. One of the main 
limitations of this study is its exploratory nature including the lack of a control arm, which hampers the 
interpretation of the reported results.   
Further, currently available data from the literature do not allow to firmly conclude on the relevance, or 
to define MSI-H/dMMR status as an independent prognostic factor, which is an additional limitation.  
Notwithstanding the above limitations, the results reported in the 119 patients from CA209142 can be 
considered clinically meaningful and are numerically superior to currently available therapies for (MSI-
H) mCRC patients. Even if it is acknowledged that historical data indicating sub-optimal outcomes in 
mCRC patients treated with 2L chemotherapy come from unselected mCRC patients, in view of the 
reported data, i.e. ORR of 61.3% (95% CI: 52.0, 70.1) with long durations of response it is difficult to 
foresee that potential differences in prognosis or response to treatment in the targeted MSI-H mCRC 
population compared to other CRC patients could challenge the relevance of obtained results, which 
have notably matured after additional 20 months of follow-up (minimum follow-up of nearly 4 years) 
and remain consistent. The available dataset for the so called 2L or ‘without 5FU-Oxa-Iri’ patients is 
certainly limited, i.e. a total of 37 patients, including 9 patients who progressed on or within 6 months 
of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting. However, the reported ORR and 
DOR are in line with those reported in 3L patients and can be expected to translate into a clinically 
meaningful effect also in this group.  
Taking all the above into account it can be concluded that clinically meaningful efficacy has been 
reported for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in the applied indication, i.e. for the treatment 
of adult patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC after prior fluoropyrimidine based combination 
chemotherapy. Further relevant information is also included in section 5.1.  
Results from part 1 of the ongoing CA2098HW phase 3 study, which are expected to provide 
replication of ORR and DOR results in the ≥2L population as well as randomised data to compare 
numerical differences between chemotherapy and nivolumab (in combination with ipilimumab) in the 
2L setting of dMMR or MSI-H mCRC, will be submitted when available as a post-authorisation measure 
(PAM) and capture as recommendation.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The WSA provided safety data, for the nivolumab + ipilimumab combination in subjects with 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC), 
from Study CA209142.  
The Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) provides safety data for one arm of combination treatment 
(N=119), where dMMR or MSI-H CRC subjects were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W), followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W). The SCS provides 
an assessment of safety based on the Feb-2019 DBL, with minimum follow-up of approximately 27.5 
months, updated from a previous CSR DBL of Aug-2017.  
In addition to the safety data from CA209142, pooled safety data of CA209142 and Study CA2092143 
(which examined nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg treatment Q3W followed by nivolumab 3 
mg/kg Q2W in subjects with renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) are presented to provide a safety profile of 
the same combination regimen in a broader population. 
Patient exposure 
Table 45. Cumulative Dose and Relative Dose Intensity Summary – All Combination Treated 
Subjects in CA209142 (Feb-2019 DBL) 
Note: the number of ipilimumab doses to be administered in combination with nivolumab was 4 per protocol in Cohort 2. 
The median duration of therapy in all combination therapy treated subjects based on Kaplan-Meier 
analysis was 24.90 months. As of the Feb-2019 DBL, the maximum duration of therapy was 44.09 
months and 2.10 months for nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively. 
Adverse events  
As of the Feb-2019 DBL, the most common AEs,  the most common drug-related AEs and deaths (none 
were ascribed to study drug toxicity) are reported in table 46. 
Assessment report

Safety summaries presented in this section are with follow-up of 30 days after last dose, except those 
with extended follow-up, which was follow-up of 100 days after last dose. 
The overall safety profile of nivolumab 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg for the treatment of subjects 
with dMMR or MSI-H CRC after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy was consistent 
with the established safety profile of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, in other tumour types, 
and no new safety concerns were identified.

Deaths attributed to “other” reasons were reported in 3 (2.5%) subjects. The verbatim terms reported 
for the ‘other’ reasons for death are as follows: 
- 
patient 1: Sudden death (died 18 days after the last dose). This death occurred between the 
DBLs. On Day 998 after the first dose, subject’s wife reported subject experienced severe pain 
and “sweating” around 3 AM. However, subject declined to go to the hospital for evaluation. 
Subject was found dead in bed later that morning. Very limited information is available due to 
lack of hospital records and autopsy.  
- 
- 
Patient 2: Respiratory failure (died 83 days after the last dose). This death was reported at the 
Aug-2017 DBL. 
Patient 3: Patient made voluntary decision to discontinue dialysis, subsequently died from 
renal failure (died 158 days after the last dose). This death was reported at the Aug-2017 DBL. 
Select Adverse Events  
Select AEs are AEs of special clinical interest that are potentially associated with the use of nivolumab, 
which the applicant identified based on the following 4 guiding principles: 
•  AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies 
•  AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g. corticosteroids) as part of their management 
•  AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity 
•  AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby 
necessitating the pooling of terms for full characterization. 
Based on these guiding principles and taking into account the types of AEs already observed across 
studies of nivolumab monotherapy, endocrinopathies, diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, 
interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently considered to be select AEs. Multiple event terms that may 
describe each of these were grouped into endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, pulmonary, renal, 
and skin select AE categories, respectively. Select AE analyses included events occurring within 30 
days of the last dose. Limited analysis of select AEs with 100 days of follow-up (i.e. extended follow-
up) was also performed. 
The most common all-causality select AEs in CA209142, by category, were skin (59.7%), 
gastrointestinal (53.8%), and hepatic (34.5%). The majority of select AEs were Grade 1-2, and most 
were considered drug related by the investigator.  
The most frequently reported drug-related any-grade select AE, by category, at the Feb-2019 DBL 
were skin (35.3% for any grade, 4.2% for Grade 3-4), endocrine (31.9% for any grade, 5.9% for 
Grade 3-4), gastrointestinal (25.2% for any grade, 3.4% for Grade 3-4), and hepatic (23.5% for any 
grade, 11.8% for Grade 3-4). The most frequently reported drug-related any-grade select AE events 
(≥ 10% of subjects at the Feb-2019 DBL), by preferred term (PT), were: diarrhoea (25.2% for any 
grade, 2.5% for Grade 3-4), pruritus (20.2% for any grade, 1.7% for Grade 3-4), hypothyroidism 
(17.6% for any grade, 0.8% for Grade 3-4), AST increased (16.0% for any grade, 7.6% for Grade 3-
4), rash (15.1% for any grade, 1.7% for Grade 3-4), hyperthyroidism (14.3% for any grade, and none 
for Grade 3-4), and ALT increased (12.6% for any grade and 6.7% for Grade 3-4). 
Across the select AE categories, the majority of events were manageable using the established 
algorithms, with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mainly systemic 
corticosteroids) were administered. Except for endocrine events, most drug-related select AEs had 
resolved (ranging from 76.2% to 100.0% across categories) at the time of database lock. Some 
Assessment report

endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone 
replacement therapy.

Other Events of Special Interest  
Other events of special interest (OESIs) are events that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as select AEs. 
These events may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require 
immunosuppression as part of their management. OESI included the following categories: 
demyelination, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, myocarditis, myositis, 
pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, and uveitis.  
In all combination therapy treated subjects, OESIs with extended follow-up, regardless of causality, 
were reported in 5 (4.2%) subjects. Events were myositis (2 subjects; 1 Grade 3, 1 Grade 2) and 1 
each of encephalitis (Grade 3), uveitis (Grade 3), and pancreatitis (Grade 3). One of the 2 myositis 
events was reported as necrotizing. All events, except uveitis, were considered drug-related by the 
investigator. All 5 events resolved.  
Safety with Extended Follow-Up in CA209142 
In CA209142, the incidence rates of AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs, and drug-related 
SAEs, reported within 100 days of the last dose were consistent with those reported within 30 days of 
the last dose. The most common all-causality AEs with extended follow-up were diarrhoea (54.6%), 
pyrexia (42.0), fatigue, pruritis, cough, and anaemia (each 33.6). 
There were 55.5% of subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE, with extended follow-up. The most 
common SAEs were malignant neoplasm progression (8.4%), pyrexia (4.2%), abdominal pain, colitis, 
diarrhoea, intestinal obstruction, large intestinal obstruction, small intestinal obstruction, dehydration, 
and acute kidney injury (each 2.5%). There were 22.7% of subjects, who experienced a drug-related 
SAE, with extended follow-up. The most common drug-related SAEs with extended follow-up were 
colitis and pyrexia (each 2.5%), adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
transaminases increased, anemia, acute kidney injury (each 1.7%). Compared to 30 days of follow-up, 
this was slightly higher for adrenal insufficiency (0.8%), diarrhoea (0.8%), but the same for colitis, 
hypophysitis, abdominal pain, transaminases increased, acute kidney injury. 
There were 79.8% of subjects who experienced a drug-related AE, with extended follow-up. Of all 
treated subjects, 44.5% had skin disorders, 33.6% had gastrointestinal disorders, and 31.1% had 
endocrine disorders. The most common drug-related select AEs with extended follow-up were 
diarrhoea (26.1%), pruritus (20.2%), fatigue (18.1%), hypothyroidism (17.6%), rash and pyrexia 
(each 15.1%), nausea and hyperthyroidism (each 14.3%), AST increased (12.6%), lipase increased 
(11.8%), asthenia and decreased appetite (each 10.9%). Compared to 30 days of follow-up, this was 
slightly higher for diarrhoea (25.2%) and nausea (13.4%), slightly lower for fatigue (18.5%) and AST 
increased (16.0%), and the same for pruritus, hypothyroidism, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, 
hyperthyroidism, lipase increased, asthenia, and decreased appetite. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations included assessments of haematology, liver, kidney, and thyroid 
function, and electrolytes. 
Haematology

Among all combination treated subjects, abnormalities in haematology tests that occurred during 
treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug were primarily Grade 1-2. 
Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were anaemia (8.7% Grade 3) and 
lymphocytopenia (7.1% Grade 3).  
Liver function tests 
Among all combination treated subjects, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) that 
occurred during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug were primarily Grade 1-2. 
Grade 3-4 liver test abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were AST (11.4% Grade 3), ALT 
(10.5% Grade 3), alkaline phosphatase (6.1% Grade 3), and bilirubin (5.3% Grade 3). 
Among all combination treated subjects, nearly half of subjects had abnormalities in ALT or AST 
parameters (all increases) that occurred during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug 
and most (19.1%) were more than 3x the upper limit of normal. 
6 (5.3%) subjects had concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3 x ULN with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within 
both 1 day and 30 days of last dose of study therapy.

Kidney Function 
Among all combination treated subjects, most subjects had normal kidney function; abnormalities in 
kidney function that occurred during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug were 
primarily Grade 1. 
The only Grade 3-4 kidney function test abnormality reported in ≥ 5% of subjects was total lipase 
(8.9% Grade 3). 
Thyroid Function 
Among all combination treated subjects, 37.5% of subjects had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
levels greater than the upper limit of normal, and 43.8% of subjects had TSH levels lower than the 
lower level of normal.

Safety to support the updates of the SmPC 
Safety data to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC were integrated across completed studies in multiple 
indications using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 
(nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q3W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV for 4 doses then nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV 
Q2W). 
The studies included in the analyses of nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q3W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV for 4 
doses then nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W were as follows: 
Renal cell carcinoma: CA209214 
Colorectal cancer: CA209142 (Cohort 2) 
In the proposed OPDIVO SmPC, in Section 4.8, Tables 7 and 10 have been updated for nivolumab 3 
mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. In the proposed YERVOY SmPC, in Section 4.8, Tables 
5 and 7 have been updated for ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg. 
Some MedDRA PTs were re-mapped or deleted for the purposes of generating summary tables to 
support Section 4.8 of the nivolumab and ipilimumab SmPCs (nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg). Remapping allowed for pooling of PTs representing the same or similar clinical 
conditions. Some MedDRA PTs were deleted from the tables generated to support the SmPC because 
they were overly general/nonspecific. 
In general pooled safety data are reflected on the SmPC as follow: 
In the pooled dataset of nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg across tumour 
types (n = 666), with a minimum follow-up ranging from 17.5 to 27.6 months, the most frequent 
adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were fatigue (58%), diarrhoea (41%), musculoskeletal pain (39%), 
rash (38%), pruritus (35%), nausea (30%), cough (29%), pyrexia (29%), abdominal pain (22%), 
arthralgia (22%), decreased appetite (22%), upper respiratory tract infection (21%), vomiting (21%), 
headache (19%), dyspnoea (19%), hypothyroidism (18%), constipation (18%), oedema (including 
peripheral oedema) (16%), dizziness (14%), hyperthyroidism (12%), dry skin (11%), hypertension 
(10%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). 
Among the patients treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, 194/666 
(29%) had the first onset of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions during the initial combination phase.

Elderly 
No overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients 
(< 65 years). Data from SCCHN and adjuvant melanoma patients 75 years of age or older are too 
limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.1). Data from dMMR or MSI-H CRC 
patients 75 years of age or older are limited (see section 5.1). Data from cHL patients 65 years of age 
or older are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.1). 
In MPM patients, there was a higher rate of serious adverse reactions and discontinuation rate due to 
adverse reactions in patients 75 years of age or older (68% and 35%, respectively) relative to all 
patients who received nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (54% and 28%, respectively). 
For patients treated with nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib, data from RCC patients 75 years 
of age or older are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.1).

Post marketing experience 
Based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by BMS Worldwide Patient Safety, review of post-
marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety data for nivolumab. The 
safety profile of nivolumab in the post-marketing setting remains favourable and similar to the profile 
established during clinical trials. To date, no new significant safety concerns have been identified based 
on global post-marketing reports. Post-marketing data for nivolumab are subject to continued active 
pharmacovigilance monitoring and are reported as per applicable post-marketing safety reporting 
requirements, as well as periodically to global health authorities. 
Based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by BMS Worldwide Patient Safety, review of post-
marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety data for ipilimumab. The 
safety profile of ipilimumab in the post-marketing setting remains favourable and similar to the profile 
established during clinical trials. Qualitative and quantitative safety information received to date does 
not raise any significant new safety concerns or substantially alter the overall known safety profile of 
ipilimumab as described in the prescribing information. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety dataset of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of patients 
with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy is based on 119 patients 
included in Cohort 2 (cStage 1 and 2) of Study CA209142. The Study CA209142 was a Phase 2, open-
label, multi-cohort (six cohorts) study of nivolumab monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab or 
other therapies in patients with recurrent or mCRC.  
In addition, integrated safety data (n=666) from the study CA209144 and study CA209214 (in patients 
with renal cell carcinoma treated with the same combination regimen), have been provided.  
Cohort 2 was comprised by patients with metastatic MSI-H/dMMM CRC, with a median age of 58.0 
years (range: 21, 88), most of them were White (92%), male (59%) with an ECOG performance status 
of 0 (45%) or 1 (55%). Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, active, 
known, or suspected autoimmune disease or a condition requiring systemic treatment with either 
corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration 
were excluded from the study. The majority of patients had received at least 2 prior regimens (76.5%) 
and 82 (69%) patients had received prior treatment with 5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan.  
Patients in Cohort 2 received nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for four cycles, followed 
by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. However, the proposed posology for the applied indication to be included 
in the SmPC (i.e. nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 cycles and then nivolumab 240 
mg Q2W) differ from the one used in the study. Moreover, the duration of the infusion is also proposed 
to be shortened (i.e. from 60 min to 30 min for nivolumab and from 90 min to 30 min for ipilimumab). 
See PK/PD section.  
At the date of the last database lock (19 Feb 2019), 43% of patients remained on treatment. Among 
patients who had discontinued treatment, disease progression was the leading cause (28%) followed 
by study drug toxicity (14%). The median number of doses received was 51.0 (range: 1 -93) for 
nivolumab and 4.0 (range: 1-4) for ipilimumab and most of patients (76.5%) received at least 90% of 
the planned dose intensity of nivolumab and ipilimumab.   
Almost all patients reported at least one adverse event (99.2%). The most frequently reported 
(≥25%) adverse events, regardless of causality, were diarrhoea (54%), pyrexia (42%), fatigue, 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 158/175 
 
 
 
pruritus, cough (34%, each), anaemia (33%), nausea, abdominal pain (29%, each), asthenia (28%) 
and back pain (27%). Of these, 59.7% were adverse events (AEs) of Grade 3-4. AEs of Grade 3-4 
most common (≥5%) were lipase increased (13%), AST increased (10%), ALT increased (8%) and 
diarrhoea (6%).  
The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab is characterised by immune-related adverse events. 
Select AEs include endocrine, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin events and 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. In this regard, the most commonly reported select AEs in patients 
treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab in study CA209142, regardless of causality, were skin events 
(60%), gastrointestinal (54%), endocrine and hepatic events (35%, each). Most of these events were 
considered drug-related (35%, 25%, 32%, 24%, respectively). By preferred term, the most frequent 
select AEs considered drug-related were diarrhoea (25.2%), pruritus (20.2%), hypothyroidism 
(17.6%), AST increased (16%), rash (15.1%), hyperthyroidism (14.3%) and ALT increased (12.6%). 
Most of events were Grade 1 or 2. Among the AEs of Grade 3-4, the most common were hepatic 
events (11.8%; mainly AST and ALT increased). No AEs of Grade 5 were reported. The majority of 
events resolved, with immune-modulating medication and/or corticosteroids, except for endocrine 
events, since only 34% of evens were resolved at the time of the data cut-off.   
There were 5 (2.5%) patients that reported other events of special interest (OESI), including myositis 
(2 patients), encephalitis, uveitis and pancreatitis (1 patient, each).  
Up to the data cut-off, 33 (27.7%) patients had died, most of them due to disease progression (29 
[24.4%]). None of the deaths was considered related to study drug toxicity. There were also 3 patients 
who died due to “other” causes. These causes were sudden death (18 days after the last dose), 
respiratory failure (83 days after the last dose) and renal failure (158 days after the last dose). None 
of these events appear to be related to study treatment.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 52.9% of patients. Of these, 22.7% were considered 
related to study treatment. Most of SAEs occurred within the SOC of endocrine and gastrointestinal 
disorders.  
There were 19 (16.0%) patients that required treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, most 
of them (16 [13.4%]) were considered treatment-related. The main AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation were AST and ALT increased (2.5%, each), autoimmune hepatitis and acute kidney 
injury (1.7, each); all of them were considered related to study treatment. 
Safety data according to age have been provided. However, data in elderly and very elderly patients 
are rather limited (there were only 11 patients 75 years or older).  
Updated safety data from the latest DBL of Oct 2020 with longer follow-up have been provided to align 
data for safety and efficacy. Overall, the safety profile remained comparable to what was observed at 
the Feb-2019 DBL. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab in patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC appear 
consistent with that observed in patients with RCC, and with the already known safety profile of each 
monocomponent.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
For final adopted wording please refer to the appended and agreed Product Information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The proposed indication for the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab is for the treatment of adult 
patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer 
after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy.  
The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg nivolumab in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab administered 
intravenously, over 30 min each, every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses. This is then followed by a second 
phase in which nivolumab monotherapy is administered intravenously at 240 mg every 2 weeks, over 
30 min. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide with a 5-year 
survival rate of approximately 14% in patients with metastatic disease (National Cancer Institute: 
surveillance, epidemiology and end results program – accessed 16 July 2020). Worldwide, CRC is the 
third most common form of cancer, with 1.8 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2018, 
constituting 10.2% of all new cancers. Among all new CRC cases, 27% were diagnosed in Europe 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 167/175 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Globocan 2018). Each year, there are about 880,792 deaths from CRC worldwide, which is 9.2% of all 
cancer deaths, making CRC the second most common cause of cancer death (Globocan 2018). The risk 
of developing CRC is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors (Chan and Giovannucci, 
2010).  
Among metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients, mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability 
high (MSI-H) tumor only accounts for approximately 5%. Patients with Lynch-like mCRC are associated 
with younger age, higher frequency of liver metastasis, more frequent resection of metastatic disease, 
thus more favourable prognosis compared to those with sporadic dMMR or MSI H mCRC. In both 
patient groups, alterations in the DNA MMR genes lead to accumulation of errors during DNA 
replication, especially in repetitive sequences known as microsatellites, causing high level of MSI. 
Thus, MSI is the molecular fingerprint of a deficient DNA mismatch repair. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Metastatic CRC is a complex and heterogeneous disease, with outcomes ranging from potential cure 
(ie, upfront resectable mCRC) to dismal (refractory wide-spread disease). Multi-modality treatment 
including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, especially in medically-fit patients with borderline or 
potentially resectable disease, is the preferred approach in earlier lines of treatment in centres capable 
of providing multidisciplinary approach and adequate supportive care. The active agents in first- and 
second-line treatment of mCRC consist of fluoropyrimidines (5-FU, capecitabine), oxaliplatin, and 
irinotecan. Doublet or triplet chemotherapy is often combined with a monoclonal antibody inhibiting 
VEGF (bevacizumab or ziv-aflibercept); or EGFR (cetuximab or panitumumab; only indicated in RAS 
wild-type tumors), depending on biomarker status and primary tumour location.  
Second-line treatment is typically a doublet chemotherapy, depending on the regimen used in first-line 
setting. The multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, and the oral nucleoside analogue 
trifluridine/tipiracil are available options beyond second-line, but efficacy was modest in the pivotal 
trials, CORRECT and RECOURSE. Another third line option, anti EGFR antibody with or without 
irinotecan, is also used in patients with RAS wild-type status who have not received anti-EGFR therapy 
in prior lines of therapy. Patients carrying tumors with BRAF V600E mutation are eligible for doublet 
targeted therapy against BRAF and EGFR in second line and beyond (combination of an anti-EGFR mAb 
with encorafenib). Additionally, larotrectinib is a new treatment option for patients whose tumors are 
positive for NTRK gene fusion, a rare alteration. 
So far, there are no approved treatment options in the EU specifically for patients with dMMR/MSI-H 
mCRC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
CA209142 (Checkmate 142) is a Phase 2 multi-cohort, open-label, multi-centre trial including 
nivolumab monotherapy (Cohort 1) or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (Cohort 2) in adults 
(≥ 18 years) who had disease progression during, after, or had been intolerant to therapy with 5FU-
based chemotherapy with recurrent or metastatic dMMR or MSI-H CRC. The dMMR or MSI-H evaluation 
was performed by local lab as part of standard diagnostic testing by investigators. MSI status was to 
be confirmed by a central testing during the study.  
For Cohort 2, which is the objective of this assessment report, study treatment scheme was nivolumab 
3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or maximum clinical benefit, per protocol.

Investigator-assessed ORR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria was the primary endpoint. BICR-assessed 
ORR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and DCR were evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this study, 
PFS and OS were exploratory endpoints.  
This study followed a 2-stage design, where an ORR threshold was needed to be met to proceed from 
Stage 1 to Stage 2. A total of 119 patients were treated with nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab (including a subset of 82 subjects who received prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri) in Cohort 2 of this study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy results of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab presented below are based on the 
latest updated database lock of Oct-2020, with a median follow-up of 46.9months. Data in the ‘all 
treated’ population are presented (n=119): 
• 
• 
The Investigator-assessed ORR was 64.7% (95% CI: 55.4, 73.2) for the all treated 
population (n=119), 63.4% (95% CI: 52.0, 73.8) ) for subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri therapy 
(n=82) and 67.6% (95% CI: 50.2, 82.0) for subjects without prior 5Fu-Oxa-Iri therapy 
(n=37). 
The BICR-assessed ORR was 61.3% (95% CI: 52.0, 70.1) for the all treated population 
(n=119), 58.5% (95% CI: 47.1, 69.3) for subjects with prior 5FU-Oxa-Iri therapy (n=82) and 
67.6% (95% CI: 50.2, 82.0) for subjects without prior 5FU Oxa-Iri therapy (n=37;). 
•  Median DOR was not reached in either case. 
•  Median PFS per investigator was N.R. (95% CI: 38.4, N.A.) and median PFS per BICR was 
56.3 (30.3, N.A.) months. 
Median OS as per investigator assessment was not reached. OS rates at 36 and 48 months, for the 
all treated patient population were, respectively, 71.4% and 70.5%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In addition to the small sample size, the main limitation of this study is its non-comparative design, 
which hampers the interpretation of the reported results, particularly of time to event endpoints. This 
is of particular relevance taking into account the uncertainties on the actual prognostic value of MMR 
status in the mCRC setting. As for the predictive value of MSI-H status this appears supported for 
immune check-point inhibitors with international consensus guidelines noting that MSI testing has 
strong predictive value for its use to treat patients with mCRC. Also external data from studies 
investigating checkpoint inhibitors in MSI-H mCRC has emerged, which support concept that patients 
with MSI-H mCRC may benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy, such as data from KEYNOTE-177 (abstract, 
Thierry et al. J Clin Oncol, 2020) and KEYNOTE-164 (Le J Clin Oncol, 2019). Even if results reported in 
cohort 2 of the CA209142 study are considered clinically relevant, data cannot be regarded as 
comprehensive as a result of the uncontrolled nature of the study that limits interpretation of data. In 
this respect the MAH has proposed to provide results from a currently ongoing randomized Phase 3b 
trial (Study CA2098HW) as a post-authorisation measure (PAM). Results from this study are expected 
to provide replication of ORR and DOR results in the ≥2L population, and also randomised data to 
compare numerical differences between chemotherapy and nivolumab (in combination with 
ipilimumab) in the 2L setting of dMMR or MSI-H mCRC. Results from this study should be submitted 
when available in the context of a recommendation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 169/175 
 
 
 
The observed magnitude of durable tumour responses could be regarded as clinically relevant as it is 
reasonable to expect that these will translate into a survival benefit; though its magnitude is yet to be 
determined. The dataset of 2L patients to support the claimed broad indication is limited (n=37) 
though results in this subpopulation are also compatible with clinically meaningful efficacy. 
The primary analysis cohort includes 119 patients among whom one patient did not receive any prior 
line of treatment and 9 received prior fluroropyrimidine based chemotherapy in the (neo)-adjuvant 
setting and progressed during or within 6 months of completion of treatment. It was initially 
questioned that patients having received fluroropyrimidine based chemotherapy in the (neo)-adjuvant 
setting and progressed during or within 6 months of completion of the treatment pertained to a 
different treatment setting and as a consequence the updated efficacy analysis (DBL Oct-2020, with 
additional follow-up of ~ 20 months) excluded all patients who had not received prior fluoropyrimidine 
based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting in cohort 2, i.e. 10 patients. It is however recognised 
that in clinical practice patients progressing on or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant 
chemotherapy in the non-metastatic setting are considered as having been treated with first-line (1L) 
chemotherapy and indeed normally excluded from clinical studies that enrol 1L patients. It is therefore 
considered that the ‘All Combination Treated Subjects’ population (n=119) is the one used for efficacy 
inference and the analysis/data to be included in the SmPC.  
A lower ORR was observed in patients from cStage 1 compared to cStage 2 (48.1% [95%CI: 28.7, 
68.1] vs. 63.0% [95%CI: 52.3, 72.9]) which could be related to the smaller size of the cStage 1 
sample. Some unbalances in baseline characteristics may also have contributed to these results. 
Lower rates of tumour response were observed in elderly patients and patients heavily pre-treated 
(more than 4 prior lines) although the number of subjects included in these subgroups is limited. 
The justification for the contribution of ipilimumab in the proposed combination is based on 
comparative efficacy data from Cohort 1 (nivo monotherapy) and Cohort 2 (nivo/ipi combination) of 
the CA209142 study. The reported superior ORR for the combination vs. the monotherapy (almost 2-
fold; 59.7% [95%CI: 50.3, 68.6] vs. 37.8% [95%CI: 26.8, 49.9], respectively) appears sufficient to 
justify that the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab leads to better efficacy in the targeted patient 
population albeit the limitations of a comparison between non randomised cohorts. No indication for 
nivolumab in monotherapy in the intended disease setting is currently sought. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main safety dataset of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of patients 
with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC after prior fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy is based on 
119 patients included in Cohort 2 of Study CA209142 at the DBL of Oct-2020.  
The median number of doses received was 51.0 (range: 1 -122) for nivolumab and 4.0 (range: 1-4) 
for ipilimumab and most of patients (75.6 fro nivolumab and 84.9% for ipilimumab%) received at least 
90% of the planned dose intensity of nivolumab and ipilimumab respectively.   
Almost all patients reported at least one adverse event (99.2%). The most frequently reported 
(≥25%) adverse events, regardless of causality, were diarrhoea (58%), pyrexia (44.5%), fatigue, 
pruritus, cough (35.5%, 34.5%, 35.3% respectively), anaemia (33.6%), nausea, abdominal pain 
(30.3% and 31.9% respectively ), asthenia (28.6%) and back pain (27.7%).  
Adverse events (AEs) of Grade 3-4 were reported in 62.2% of patients, being the most common 
(≥5%) lipase increased, AST increased, ALT increased  and diarrhoea. 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 170/175 
 
 
 
Select AEs in patients treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab include endocrine, 
gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin events and hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. The 
most commonly reported select AEs, regardless of causality, were skin events (60%), gastrointestinal 
(58%), endocrine and hepatic events (34.5% and 36.1% respectively). Most of these events were 
considered drug-related (38.7%, 26.9%, 31.9%, 26.1%, respectively). By preferred term, the most 
frequent select AEs considered drug-related were diarrhoea (26.9%), pruritus (21%), hypothyroidism 
(17.6%), AST increased (16.8%), rash (16%), hyperthyroidism (14.3%) and ALT increased (14.6%). 
Most of events were Grade 1 or 2. Among the AEs of Grade 3-4, the most common were hepatic 
events (11.8%; mainly AST and ALT increased). No AEs of Grade 5 were reported.  
There were 5 (2.5%) patients that reported other events of special interest (OESI), including myositis 
(2 patients), encephalitis, uveitis and pancreatitis (1 patient, each).  
Up to the latest data cut-off (oct-2020), 35 (29.4%) patients had died, most of them due to disease 
progression (31 [26.1%]). None of the deaths was considered related to study drug toxicity. There 
were also 3 patients who died due to “other” causes (sudden death, respiratory failure and renal 
failure.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 55.5% of patients. Of these, 22.7% were considered 
related to study treatment. Most of SAEs occurred within the SOC of endocrine and gastrointestinal 
disorders.  
There were 19 (16.0%) patients that required treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, most 
of them (16 [13.4%]) were considered treatment-related. The main AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation were AST and ALT increased (2.5%, each), autoimmune hepatitis and acute kidney 
injury (1.7, each); all of them were considered related to study treatment. 
Safety data according to age have been provided. However, data in elderly and very elderly patients 
are rather limited (there were only 11 patients 75 years or older). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data of the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab in the applied indication is very limited in 
elderly patients (≥75 years), which hampers a proper characterisation of the safety profile in this 
patient population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, the reported results with the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab in the 119 patients with 
dMMR or MSI-H mCRC who had disease progression during, after, or had been intolerant to therapy 
with 5FU-based chemotherapy included in cohort 2 of study CA209142 are considered of clinical 
relevance.  
The main limitation of the study, in addition to its limited sample size, is its non-comparative design, 
which hampers the interpretation of the reported results, particularly of time to event endpoints. This 
is of particular relevance taking into account the uncertainties regarding the actual prognostic value of 
MMR status in the metastatic CRC setting.   
The ORR and duration of response shown in study CA209142, even if in the context of a single arm 
trial where results might be overestimated, well exceeds the ORR reported in other mCRC trials 
(although not selected by dMMR/MSI-H status, trials conducted years ago) where response rates in 
e.g. second line were around 13-32% depending on the administered treatment and KRAS mutation 
status (Giantonio BJ, et al J Clin Oncol, 2007; Benouna J, et al Lancet Oncol, 2013). In the recent 
KEYNOTE-177 study, a phase 3 randomised study in patients with dMMR or MSI-H mCRC previously 
untreated with chemotherapy, an ORR of 33% (95%CI: 2.8, 37.5) and a median DoR of 10.6 months 
was reported in patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (abstract, Thierry et al. J 
of Clin Oncol, 2020). Additional (within-patient) information/analyses to better understand the clinical 
relevance of the study results and to confirm their robustness have been submitted together with an 
update of the efficacy analysis at the latest DBL of Oct 2020. BICR-assessed ORR results previously 
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021  
Page 172/175 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed have been confirmed and are of similar magnitude for 2L and 3L subjects. Median duration of 
response has not been reached. Of note, even if interpretation of time to event related endpoints is 
jeopardized by the uncontrolled nature of the study, OS rates at 36 and 48 months are of notable 
relevance (i.e. 71.4% and 70.5%, respectively).    
In summary, efficacy results reported in cohort 2 of study CA209142 are considered clinically 
meaningful and are numerically superior to that obtained with currently available therapies for (MSI-H) 
mCRC patients. The available data set for 2L patients of 37 patients, including 9 patients who 
progressed on or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in the non-metastatic 
setting, is certainly limited. However, it is difficult to foresee that potential differences in prognosis or 
response to treatment in the targeted MSI-H mCRC population compared to other CRC patients could 
challenge the relevance of the reported ORR with long durations of response that have notably 
matured after additional 20 months of follow-up (minimum follow-up of nearly 4 years) and remain 
consistent.  
The indication wording is supported and efficacy data from the ‘all treated population’ (n=119) has 
been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In addition, the patient population enrolled in the study has 
been described in detail, including specific requirements for patients having received treatment in the 
adjuvant setting.  
The justification for the contribution of ipilimumab in the proposed combination, which is based on 
comparative efficacy data from Cohort 1 (nivo monotherapy) and Cohort 2 (nivo/ipi combination) of 
study CA209142, appears sufficient to justify that the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab leads to 
better efficacy in the targeted patient population albeit the limitations of a comparison between non 
randomised cohorts.  
From a safety point of view, the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in the 
intended indication appears consistent with that previously observed in other indications and is in line 
with the already known safety profile of each component. The combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab 
is characterised by a high incidence of adverse events, especially those considered immunomediated. 
Finally, the MAH plans to provide results of a currently ongoing randomized Phase 3b trial (Study 
CA2098HW) in the first line setting as a post-authorisation measure (PAM).  Results from this study 
are expected to provide replication of ORR and DoR results in the ≥2L population, and also randomised 
data to compare numerical differences between chemotherapy and nivolumab (in combination with 
ipilimumab) in the 2L setting of dMMR or MSI-H mCRC. Results from this study should be submitted 
when available in the context of a recommendation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Combination treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab resulted in an ORR benefit in the treatment of 
adult patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability high metastatic colorectal 
cancer after prior fluoropyrimidine based combination chemotherapy. 
The overall safety profile of the combination appears to be similar to that observed with the same 
combination in other indications and seems in line with the safety profile of both components 
The benefit-risk balance is therefore considered positive in the target population as represented by the 
adopted indication. 
The benefit risk balance for the claimed indication is considered positive.  
Assessment report  
EMA/314215/2021

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The final adopted indication is: 
for Opdivo: 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch 
repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer after prior 
fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy. 
for Yervoy: 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch 
repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer after prior 
fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of nivolumab + ipilimumab in the claimed indication is positive.

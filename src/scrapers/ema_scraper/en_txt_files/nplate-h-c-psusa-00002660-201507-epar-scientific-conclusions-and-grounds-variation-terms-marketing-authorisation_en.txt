Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
During the PSUR reporting period a signal originated from the Marketing Authorisation Holder’s (MAH) 
Product  Complaints  database  where  9  product  complaints  regarding  reconstitution  and  administration 
guideline were identified, indicating that the potential for confusion over vial overfill for Nplate exists. 
In  relation  to  this  concern  the  MAH  performed  a  review  of  all  available  sources  (safety  database, 
clinical trial database, nonclinical data review, literature review…) where a total of 13 cases from post-
marketing  sources  were  identified.  In  addition,  one  case  from  a  literature  report  was  identified 
regarding the potential for confusion when preparing the solution for injection. In view of the available 
data,  the  PRAC  recommends  an  update  of  the  product  information  in  order  to  clarify  the  vial  overfill 
and how to reconstitute the product safely.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding romiplostim, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.

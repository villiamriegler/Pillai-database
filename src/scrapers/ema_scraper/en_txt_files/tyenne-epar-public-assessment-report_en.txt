• 
• 
the treatment of severe, active and 
progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
in adults not previously treated with 
MTX. 
the treatment of moderate to severe 
active RA in adult patients who have 
either responded inadequately to, or 
who were intolerant to, previous 
therapy with one or more disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF) antagonists. 
In these patients, Tyenne can be given as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or 
where continued treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Not applicable for a biosimilar. 
2.2.  About the product 
MSB11456 has been developed as a proposed tocilizumab biosimilar to US-licensed Actemra (US-
licensed reference product, referred to as US-Actemra in the remainder of the document) and EU-
approved RoActemra (EU-RoActemra) in the remainder of the document) for subcutaneous (SC) and 
intravenous (IV) use for approval in the European Union (EU) 
The active substance, tocilizumab, is a recombinant humanised anti-human interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin gamma 1, kappa subclass (IgG1κ) 
directed against both the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) and the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-
6R). 
Tocilizumab belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group antineoplastics and immunomodulating agents, 
immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors. The anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) Code is 
L04AC7. 
The applicant is seeking approval for Tyenne for both administration routes and all indications for the 
reference medicinal product EU-RoActemra, namely:

1.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (IV and SC route) 
2.  Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients 1 year (SC route) / 2 years (IV route) of 
age and older 
3.  Juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (PJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older (IVC and SC route) 
4.  Giant cell arteritis (GCA) (SC route) 
5.  Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-induced severe or life-threatening CRS in adults and 
pediatric patients 2 years of age and older (IV route)  
6.  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalised adults who are receiving systemic 
corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation (IV route) 
As for the reference product, the use of MSB11456 in the treatment of RA, PJIA, and SJIA is proposed 
for both the IV and SC routes of administration, whereas treatment of GCA is through the SC route and 
treatment of CRS and COVID-19 disease is through the IV route only. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme for MSB11456 consisted of three phase 1 studies where two 
included healthy individuals with the objective to evaluate PK comparability of intravenous 
administration of MSB11456 versus US-Actemra (FK 456-002) and for subcutaneous administration of 
MSB11456 versus EU-RoActemra/US-Actemra (MS200740-0001). A third study (FK456-003) included 
healthy participants with the aim to evaluate PK equivalence in pre-filled syringe versus auto-injector 
(AI) administration of MSB114556. All studies are finalised. 
The demonstration of biosimilarity of MSB111456 to RoActemra is based on the totality of evidence 
data of analytical, nonclinical, and clinical comparative studies to demonstrate structural and functional 
similarity. 
Data submitted within this application concerns results from study (FKS456-001), a randomised, 
double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-group, two arm clinical study conducted in patients with 
moderately to severely active RA who have experienced an inadequate clinical response to at least one 
DMARD (either synthetic or biologic) and are currently receiving a stable dose of methotrexate. The 
overall aim is to evaluate efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity similarity of MSB11456 to EU-
RoActemra. The study includes 604 patients with RA (302 in each treatment arm) that were 
randomised to either MSB11456 or EU-RoActemra Single use prefilled syringe (PFS) 162 mg 
tocilizumab/0.9 mL solution for SC injection administered every week.

compendial tests. The verification of the specific procedures for the in-process tests are satisfactorily 
described. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) 
The PPQ of the active substance manufacturing process was executed at the proposed commercial 
active substance manufacturing site, at Merck Serono S.A., Corsier-sur-Vevey (MS-Vevey), 
Switzerland. Demonstration of successful validation was achieved by showing that the runs were 
operated with process parameters within their normal operating range (NOR), and ultimately within 
their proven acceptable range (PAR), and by meeting the acceptance criteria on IPCs for the process 
intermediates, and on active substance batches. All deviations in the manufacturing process were 
reported and investigation(s) were conducted. The deviations are described and assessed to have no 
impact on product quality or process performance. 
In conclusion, it is agreed that the PPQ study sufficiently demonstrates that the intended commercial 
manufacturing process performs as expected and produces substance meeting the active substance 
specification consistently. Hence, the process is considered validated. 
The PPQ results are acceptably described. 
Resin and Filter Lifetime Studies 
The resin lifetimes were evaluated at small scale in order to establish prospectively the maximum 
number of cycles that can be applied in manufacturing. Adequate performance with repeated use was 
demonstrated by characterisation of step performance at regular intervals, including step yield and 
product quality. Acceptance criteria were met for all monitored attributes. 
The resin and filter lifetime studies, including the conclusions, are found acceptable. 
Reprocessing 
Impact of reprocessing was evaluated. The validation approach is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 17/126 
 
 
 
 
Hold Times Studies 
Hold time studies were performed and the proposed hold times are considered acceptable.  
Impurity clearance 
An impurity clearance validation was performed. The impurities included in the evaluation were 
process-related impurities and product-related substances. The clearance profiles of process-related 
and product-related impurities demonstrated that the active substance manufacturing process is able 
to consistently and efficiently remove those impurities or maintain them at very low levels all along the 
purification process, therefore ensuring an acceptable residual quantity of process- and product-related 
impurities in the final active substance. The results are found acceptable. 
Shipping validation 
As part of the PPQ, a shipping validation has been performed with the active substance batches. The 
stability-indicating quality attributes of the active substance samples were tested to ensure that 
shipment had no adverse impact on the product quality. All samples met the acceptance criteria. The 
validation approach is found acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing process history 
During development, the active substance manufacturing process has been subject to changes. Details 
on the changes implemented at each purification step are provided. This is found acceptable. 
The history of the active substance batches and their use during development are acceptably 
described. 
A comparability exercise was conducted to ascertain that the pre- and post-change active substance 
batches are comparable in terms of quality, safety and efficacy. To identify the impact of the proposed 
change, results were evaluated. All quality attributes studied in the comparability studies for the 
change of active substance show a high degree of similarity with very few and minor differences noted 
and are assessed as not expected to have any impact on safety or efficacy. Therefore, it can be agreed 
that comparability has been sufficiently demonstrated for all the attributes tested and evaluated in this 
comparability study. 
CQA and CPP assessment 
The identification of the CQAs was accomplished by using prior knowledge, experimental data and 
applicable published knowledge. The CQA identification is found acceptable. A final list of the CQAs has 
been introduced. 
Process parameters were evaluated to identify the potential critical process parameters (pCPPs) based 
on prior knowledge derived from manufacturing and process development activities, relevant literature 
and scientific expertise. The approach is found acceptable. 
Process characterisation studies 
Process characterisation studies are presented. The expected outcome of the process characterisation 
studies was a list of confirmed CPPs and associated proven acceptable ranges (PARs). 
Critical material attributes (CMA) 
An identification of CMAs, that can have an impact on the CQAs of the active substance, was 
performed. Some materials were defined as critical. For these materials, risk mitigation actions were 
considered. The approach is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 18/126 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of risk of nitrosamines 
An assessment was performed to evaluate the risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
active substance. Several potential sources were assessed. The conclusion was that the risk was 
negligible. The conclusion is assessed to be acceptable. 
Extractables and leachables, contact materials 
An evaluation of leachables and extractables from contact materials was performed on the materials 
with product contact during the active substance manufacturing process (excluding the active 
substance container, which is evaluated in Section 3.2.S.6), with an acceptable conclusion that the 
safety concern was negligible. 
Small-scale reprocessing studies 
Nanofiltration and final filtration reprocessing studies were performed at small-scale in order to 
evaluate the impact of repeated nanofiltrations on product quality. This was achieved by characterising 
the step performance and product quality over successive filtrations. All acceptance criteria were met, 
demonstrating that reprocessing performed at small-scale have no impact on active substance quality. 
The conclusion is assessed to be acceptable. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
Characterisation of MSB11456 was performed with respect to primary structure and post-translational 
modification (PTMs), higher order structure, purity/impurities and product related substances, general 
characteristics and biological characterisation. Different batches were used for characterisation, 
including batches manufactured by the commercial process and batches manufactured by an older 
version of the process. In general, state-of-the-art methods were applied and most relevant 
characteristics have been evaluated. 
Structural and Physicochemical characterisation 
Several techniques were applied to fully characterise the primary structure. Analysis of post-
translational modifications was performed. Overall, the presence and levels of detected PTMs are found 
consistent between batches and in line with what can be expected for therapeutic monoclonal 
antibodies and are therefore considered acceptable.   
Higher order structure was investigated. The results from all methods demonstrated acceptable higher 
order structure. 
Biological characterisation 
Biological activity characterisation for MSB11456 active substance addressed Fab binding and Fc 
binding. Fab binding and Fc binding were evaluated and consistent results were obtained for all 
batches under study. Results from a cell-based IL-6 Inhibition Bioassay are also included in the 
characterisation section and the choice of this cell-based assay as the sole potency assay included in 
the active substance and finished product specifications is found acceptably justified. 
Regarding the biological characterisation, the results are further evaluated in the biosimilarity 
assessment exercise. In addition, analyses of Fc effector functions and intracellular signaling activities 
are evaluated in the biosimilarity section. This is found acceptable. 
Impurities 
Potential impurities and product variants of MSB11456 are categorised into the two main categories 
product-related substances and process-related impurities. The categorisation is found acceptable, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 19/126 
 
 
 
 
the methods used for characterisation are found relevant. The results are presented and the 
characterisation of product-related substances is found acceptable. 
The results confirm efficient removal of all process-related impurities. This is found acceptable. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
Active substance specification including methods to evaluate identity, purity, impurities, biological 
activity, protein content, microbiological and a few general characteristics is presented. For compendial 
methods, references are made to the corresponding Ph. Eur. chapters. This is found acceptable. For 
non-compendial method, the type of method used for analysis is stated and in-house method numbers 
are defined. 
Justification of specification 
For active substance, the acceptance criteria at release and end of shelf life are identical for all 
specification tests. Overall, the active substance specification criteria are aligned with the finished 
product specification limits at release, where applicable. This is found acceptable. 
Analytical procedures and method validations 
The tests for appearance, clarity, degree of coloration, pH, bioburden and bacterial endotoxins are 
stated to comply with Ph. Eur. This is found acceptable. Method descriptions of all non-compendial 
procedures are provided. For all methods, the method principle is described, the equipment, method 
parameters and samples to be analysed are listed. System suitability criteria are also listed, and the 
calculation and reporting of results are sufficiently described. Examples of typical chromatograms and 
electropherograms are provided. The method descriptions are found adequate and sufficient.  
Comprehensive validation summaries are provided including descriptions of validation approaches, 
parameters, samples and obtained results. Relevant validation parameters have been evaluated. 
Overall, the methods were demonstrated to be adequately validated. 
Batch analysis 
Results from batch analysis of active substance batches are presented. Some of the batches were 
manufactured with the commercial process. All results complied with the proposed specification limits 
in place at the time of testing. The provided data from the commercial process is in support of a 
consistent manufacture of active substance. 
Reference standards 
Two different sets of reference standards have been used throughout active substance development. 
Initially, a one-tiered approach based on the interim reference standard (IRS) Tocilizumab 2016/01 
was applied. In 2021, a two-tiered reference standard was implemented, consisting of a primary 
reference standard and a secondary house standard. Adequate information on the current and interim 
standards is provided. In conclusion, the reference standards are found sufficiently characterised.  
Container Closure System 
The active substance container closure is a flexible bag. The layer that contacts with the active 
substance is made of a copolymer, which has been demonstrated to be compliant to Ph. Eur. 3.1.7. 
This is found acceptable. 
To demonstrate suitability of the system, the safety of product-contact materials during intended use 
was evaluated. An extractables and leachables assessment was carried out to provide evidence that 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 20/126 
 
 
 
 
the container closure components do not leach harmful or undesirable amounts of substances that 
could pose a risk to patients. The studies, including this conclusion, are considered acceptable.  
Based on the results obtained it can be concluded that the risk to patients arising from substances 
leaching from the proposed container closure system into active substance is negligible. This is 
considered acceptable. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The stability of MSB11456 active substance was tested under long-term, accelerated and stressed 
stability conditions. The active substance batches included in the stability programme in support of the 
shelf-life have been listed. The testing protocol for the PPQ batches is provided, along with the testing 
frequency. 
For the stability studies, the container closure system is considered representative of the container 
routinely used for long-term storage. This is found acceptable. 
For the long-term storage conditions, all results met the stability acceptance criteria and are within the 
limits defined for commercial specification. The results indicate that the active substance is stable 
under long-term intended storage conditions supporting the proposed shelf-life for the active 
substance. 
Data from studies on accelerated and stress storage studies are acceptably presented.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product (FP-IV)

when stored in the commercial container protected from light. 
In addition, the FP-SC may be stored at temperatures up to 25°C for a single period of up to 14 days. 
The pre-filled syringe must be protected from light, and discarded if not used within the 14 day period. 
The proposed shelf-life is found acceptable. 
2.4.4.5.  Biosimilarity 
Overall approach 
MSB11456 (tocilizumab) has been developed as a proposed biosimilar to the reference medicinal 
product (RMP) EU-approved RoActemra and the reference product (RP) US-approved Actemra. The 
RMP for the MAA is EU-approved RoActemra, but bridging to US-approved Actemra is required since 
the RP has been used in some clinical trials.  
Lots included in the biosimilarity assessment 
The applicant states that MSB11456 and RoActemra are identical with respect to pharmaceutical form, 
concentration and route of administration and differ only in formulation. The differences in formulations 
are sufficiently described. The analytical biosimilarity assessment involves MSB11456 finished product, 
RoActemra and Actemra for both subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) administration. A table is 
provided, showing the number of batches included for each analytical procedure. In conclusion, the 
number of batches of both MSB11456 and the RMP are considered sufficient.  
The age of the batches at time tested is also clearly shown. The applicant confirms that the MSB11456 
batches were relatively young at the time of testing in comparison to RP/RMP batches. Therefore, an 
evaluation of attributes that could change on storage is included in the biosimilarity section, and 
reference is given to stability section 3.2.P.8. A few of the attributes were found to change over time. 
These attributes are included with the comparative analytical data in the relevant subsections of 
Section 3.2.R.1.3. Overall, the presentation of age of batches and the evaluation of impact on 
attributes are found acceptable. The impact on specific attributes will be assessed in conjunction with 
the corresponding subsections. 
Analytical similarity acceptance criteria and statistical approach 
Criticality ranking was performed for physicochemical and biological attributes and a criticality score 
was calculated for each attribute based on severity of clinical impact and the likelihood/uncertainty of 
clinical impact. The approach is found acceptable.  
For statistical analysis, data from attributes of moderate to very high criticality were evaluated using 
the quality range approach, mean ±X SD. Justifications for setting X are provided for each attribute. To 
allow for comparison of attributes of low and very low criticality scores and attributes for which 
statistical analysis is not feasible, tables of data, raw data and graphical data are presented side-by-
side for MSB11456, RMP and RP. Depending on the attribute, similarity is evaluated by visual 
comparison of the raw data such as spectra or descriptive statistics (mean and minimum to maximum 
ranges). It should be note that also for attributes where quality ranges are calculated, tables of data 
and side-by-side comparisons are presented.  
Overall, the statistical approach is found acceptable. The strategy to provide graphical and tabular 
presentations of individual analytical results enables an assessment independent of the defined quality 
ranges for each attribute. From the graphical presentations, it was also concluded that the quality 
ranges were acceptably defined.

Primary structure and Post-translational modifications 
The primary sequence of MSB11456 and the RMP and RP was evaluated by peptide mapping. The 
sequence coverage was determined to be 100% for all three products.  
The masses of the intact light chain and the deglycosylated heavy chain were demonstrated to comply 
with the theoretical molecular masses, and thus to be similar between MSB11456 and the RMP. The 
light chain was detected predominantly at around 23500 Da. The assignment of peaks is found 
accurate. 
Furthermore, no results were provided for the intact molecule and also not for the glycosylated heavy 
chain. This is considered a limitation.  
Post-translational modifications were investigated by peptide mapping. The level of deamidation was 
confirmed to be comparable. In addition, the level of methionine oxidation was sufficiently 
demonstrated to be similar between MSB11456 batches and RMP. 
The level of glycation was demonstrated to differ significantly between MSB11456 and the RMP, in that 
the levels are higher for MSB11456 both in terms of total glycation and glycation for individual chains. 
The applicant justified these differences. The biological activity of MSB11456 and the RMP was also 
demonstrated to be similar, see the following section. In addition, a thorough evaluation of the 
structure-function relationship is presented in section 3.2.R.1.5.6. In conclusion, it is found sufficiently 
justified that the efficacy is not influenced by the slightly higher level of glycation observed for the 
RMP.  
N- and C-terminal variants were investigated by peptide mapping and Edman sequencing and the 
same N- and C-terminal variants were identified for MSB11456 and the RMP. The levels were 
sufficiently similar, with slight shifts observed that are not likely to influence efficiency or safety. 
Overall, similar primary structure and post-translational modifications have at large been 
demonstrated for batches of the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), to the 
EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP).  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 36/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It can also be concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra (RMP) and US-approved Actemra are 
considered comparable with respect to primary structure and PTMs. 
Higher order structure 
The secondary structure of MSB11456 finished product was demonstrated to be similar to RMP and RP 
by FTIR and far-UV-CD. Tertiary structure was demonstrated to be similar by near UV-CD and 
fluorescence scan spectroscopy.  
The levels of free thiols were determined to be consistently low, and the position of disulfide bonds 
were confirmed for all three products. 
In conclusion, the analyses included in the study and the obtained results sufficiently demonstrate that 
the higher order structure of MSB11456 is similar to that of the RMP, for both the PFS and the vial 
presentations. It can also be concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra (RMP) and US-approved 
Actemra are considered comparable with respect to higher order structure. 
Purity and impurities 
Several complementary and orthogonal analytical tests have been applied to compare batches of the 
biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), to the EU approved RoActemra (RMP) 
and US approved Actemra (RP) for SC or IV use with respect to purity and impurities. This comparison 
includes assessment of monomer content and HMW forms (dimer and higher aggregates) by SE-HPLC, 
AUC and SE-HPLCMALLS, as well as determination of purity by CE-SDS and sub-visible particles by LO 
and MFI. 
The chromatograms for SE-HPLC show similar size variant profiles for both the MSB11456 vial (FP-IV) 
and PFS (FP-SC) compared to RoActemra and Actemra. The level of HMWs as determined by SE-HPLC 
is in general found low for all products studied and the FP-IV batches have slightly lower levels of 
HMWs than the corresponding RMP and RP. The applicant considers this difference as positive for the 
biosimilar candidate and this is agreed to. 
Similar monomeric purity, dimer and higher aggregate levels have been demonstrated by AUC for both 
the MSB11456 vial (FP-IV) and PFS (FP-SC) compared to RoActemra and Actemra. Similar monomer 
molecular weight has been demonstrated by SE-HPLC MALLS for both the MSB11456 vial (FP-IV) and 
PFS (FP-SC) compared to RoActemra and Actemra. 
The CE-SDS electropherograms show that all products studied contain the same species.  The applicant 
considers this slight difference as positive for the biosimilar candidate and this is agreed to. 
The levels of SVP as determined by LO and MFI are found comparable or slightly lower for the 
MSB11456 vial (FP-IV) and PFS (FP-SC) compared to RoActemra and Actemra. The levels are also 
found well within the limits as defined in Ph. Eur. 2.9.19. 
In conclusion, the assessment of monomer content and HMW/LMW forms by SE-HPLC, AUC and SE-
HPLC-MALLS, and determination of purity and LMW species by CE-SDS and sub-visible particles by LO 
and MFI all support the biosimilarity claim for the MSB11456 vial (FP-IV) and PFS (FP-SC) compared to 
the RMP RoActemra and RP Actemra. It can also be concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra (RMP) 
and US-approved Actemra are considered comparable with respect to the analysis of purity and 
impurities. 
Product variants 
This section on product variants provides a summary of data to demonstrate similarity for batches of 
the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), to the EU approved RoActemra 
Assessment report

(RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP) with respect to charge, oxidation, sialic acids and glycan 
variants. 
The analysis of charge variants profile for similarity was performed by using IEX-HPLC and an 
orthogonal icIEF method. 
IEX-HPLC show highly similar charge variants profile for batches of the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 
FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), to the EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP). A 
somewhat lower/higher level of acidic and/or basic variants is noted for the MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and 
FP-SC (PFS) compared to the RMP and RP. The applicant argues that this difference is minor and not 
expected to be clinically meaningful. This is agreed to.  
icIEF show similar levels of acidic, basic and main peaks although the levels of basic peaks are slighly 
lower for MSB11456 FP-SC (PFS) compared to the batches of RMP RoActemra and RP Actemra.  
RP-UPLCwas employed to assess oxidised product variants. This analysis shows similar levels in 
oxidation for batches of the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), to the EU 
approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP). A minor difference is noted between the 
MSB11456 FP-SC and US-approved Actemra (RP), however, the applicant argues that this minor 
difference is highly unlikely to be clinically meaningful and this is agreed to. 
Sialic acid analysis by HPAEC-PAD demonstrated that MSB11456 and the RMP and RP have similar, 
very low levels of sialic acid capped glycans.  
Glycan mapping by 2AB was performed to compare the glycosylation profile between MSB11456 and 
the RMP/RP. The patterns are similar.  The applicant justifies that the observed difference in 
galactosylation is not expected to impact biological activities in vivo. The justification is found 
acceptable.  
In conclusion, similar charge variants profile, oxidised variants and sialic acids have at large been 
demonstrated for batches of the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), to the 
EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP). The minor differences noted in charge 
variants profile have been sufficiently justified as not clinically meaningful. The differences in 
formulations between the biosimilar candidate FP-IV and FP-SC to the RMP RoActemra and RP Actemra 
seem only to have a minor impact on charge variants and level of oxidised species.  
It can also be concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra (RMP) and US-approved Actemra are 
considered comparable with respect to the analysis of charge, oxidation and sialic acids. 
Analytical biosimilarity with respect to glycan groups is found demonstrated. In addition, it can be 
concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra (RMP) and US-approved Actemra are considered 
comparable with respect to glycan groups. 
Biological characterisation 
The methods used to for characterisation of biological activity can be divided into four categories, i.e. 
those measuring Fab binding, intracellular signalling activity, Fc binding and Fc effector function, 
respectively. The methods are sufficiently described in the dossier. 
Fab binding is tested by different assays. For both vial and PFS it is demonstrated that Fab binding and 
inhibition of IL-6 activity of MSB11456 is similar as compared to EU-RMP and the US-RP. This is found 
acceptable. 
Several analytical tests have been applied to compare MSB11456, EU-RMP and US-RP with respect to 
Fc-related bioactivity. Binding towards FcRn, FcγR was evaluated by SPR methods and C1q was 
evaluated by ELISA. Data from the analyses is presented both graphically and in tabular form. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 38/126 
 
 
 
 
results sufficiently demonstrate that Fc binding of MSB11456 is similar to EU-RMP and US-RP, for both 
the PFS and the vial presentations. This is found acceptable. 
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
were evaluated since these effector functions cannot be excluded as potentially contributing to the 
biological activities of an IgG1 antibody directed against a membrane bound target. The results 
sufficiently demonstrate lack of ADCC and CDC for MSB11456, EU-RMP and US-RP.  
A few additional in vitro pharmacodynamic studies were performed to complement the Fab, Fc binding 
and effector function assays for both the PFS and vial presentations. The results further support the 
biosimilarity claim with respect to biological activity. 
In conclusion, the methods used for biological characterisation are found relevant and appropriately 
described. The results confirmed that the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC 
(PFS), is similar to the EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP) with respect to 
biological activity. It can also be concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra (RMP) and US-approved 
Actemra are considered comparable. 
Comparative forced degradation stability study 
The results from comparative forced degradation stability studies of the biosimilar candidate, 
MSB11456 FP-IV (vial, all three volumes) and FP-SC (PFS), to the EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and 
US approved Actemra (RP) are provided in section 3.2.P.8.3 but are assessed in the Analytical 
similarity section in 3.2.R.1. 
In conclusion, the results from the comparative forced degradation stability studies demonstrate 
similar degradation rates and pathways for the biosimilar candidate, MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC 
(PFS), to the EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP). Furthermore, additional 
data from comparative variant characterisation studies of the impact of oxidation, charge and size 
variants and glycation on biological activities show that the minor differences seen between MSB11456 
FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS) to RoActemra and Actemra have no effect on binding and potency. The 
comparison in the comparative forced degradation study supports the claim for biosimilarity. 
It can also be concluded that the EU-approved RoActemra and US-approved Actemra are considered 
comparable with respect to the results provided in the comparative forced degradation stability 
studies. 
2.4.4.1.  Adventitious agents 
The origin of the CHO cell line, the pre-MCB and the MCB-1, WCB-1.1 and the ExCB-1.1.2 (extended 
cultivation) have all been described adequately in their history and manufacture. 
There are no animal derived components used in the active substance upstream or downstream 
processes or in the finished product formulation. All raw materials are certified to be free of animal 
derived components based on supplier certificates and a BSE/TSE declaration. 
The MCB-1, WCB-1.1 and ExCB-1.1.2 were all tested negative.  
The testing of future WCBs is found appropriate. The necessity to perform in vivo tests for the 
qualification of future WCBs was removed by the applicant in line with 3R recommendation. 
Model viruses were used in the virus clearance studies. The extent and type of viruses used with their 
different characteristics of genome, size and enveloped or non-enveloped are endorsed. 
The selection of steps studied and the rationale for the chosen parameters used during the scale-down 
studies are justified and further described. Some further information on the use of controls was asked 
for and provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 39/126 
 
 
 
 
A risk assessment with a discussion on CPPs for viral clearance has been provided and study conditions 
for all steps were discussed. Where a worst case setting for a parameter could not be identified, set 
points were used. This is accepted. 
In summary, the applicant has provided the history and testing of the cell substrates and 
demonstrated control over the materials used in their development and also the materials used in the 
manufacturing process. The testing and demonstrated clearance capacity of different viruses of the 
manufacturing process is found sufficient. It is agreed that tocilizumab is safe from adventitious agents 
and TSE. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Tyenne dossier is overall of good quality and no major objections related to quality aspects have 
been raised. Information on development, manufacture and control of active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory way. The results of tests carried out indicate that the 
active substance and finished product is manufactured in a validated and well-controlled process. 
The applicant has analysed the similarity between the biosimilar candidate MSB11456 and EU approved 
RoActemra in a comprehensive comparability exercise. 
In general, Tyenne is considered to be similar to the EU approved RoActemra at the quality level. 
Some minor differences are noted but the applicant justifies all minor differences as being not clinically 
meaningful. This is acceptable. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Tyenne is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Tyenne is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.7.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends further points for investigation.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of MSB111456 and RoActemra is tocilizumab, a recombinant humanised 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptors 
(IL-6R) and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Tocilizumab specifically binds to the IL-6 
binding site of both soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound IL-6R (mIL-6R) with similar affinity, 
preventing IL-6 binding to both receptors and thereby blocking the activity of IL-6. Consequently, IL-6-
driven cellular functions are down-regulated. 
The Non-clinical programme was focused on primary pharmacodynamics (PD). A series of in vitro PD 
studies was performed to assess any potential differences in biological activity between MSB11456 and 
the reference products RoActemra (EU) or Actemra (US). Given that MSB11456 is developed as a 
proposed biosimilar, secondary PD, safety pharmacology and PD drug interaction, PK/toxicokinetic 
(TK), or relevant toxicology studies were not deemed necessary, which is in accordance with EMA 
guideline [EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010].

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
For the non-clinical evaluation of MSB11456, a series of comparative in vitro studies to evaluate 
similarity between MSB11456 and RoActemra (EU) or Actemra (US) was conducted.  
The in vitro pharmacological properties of MSB11456 were investigated using binding and functional 
assays, taking into consideration that tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass that 
binds to the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). The in vitro PD activity of MSB11456 was compared with 
multiple batches of the reference products. 
The in vitro assessment of binding and function included in vitro pharmacodynamics assays regarding 
Fab-dependent biological activities, Fc binding activities, Fc effector function characterisation and the 
supportive IL-6 induced and sIL-6R driven in vitro signalling assays.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance (MSB111456, tocilizumab) is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter 
the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, MSB111456 is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical data package was focused on comprehensive in vitro functional activity analyses 
relevant for tocilizumab mechanism of action. No in vivo pharmacology, PK/TK, or toxicology studies 
were conducted as they are not generally required for a biosimilar for the approval of the marketing 
authorisation within EU.  
The in vitro assessment of binding and function included in vitro pharmacodynamics assays regarding 
Fab-dependent biological activities, Fc binding activities, Fc effector function characterisation and the 
supportive assays (concerning IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation, sIL-6R driven STAT3 signalling). 
The functional in vitro data package is deemed adequate for demonstrating the similar biological 
activity of MSB11456 and RoActemra or Actemra for both the SC and IV presentation and reflects the 
principal mode of actions of tocilizumab. Please refer to section 2.4 of this report. 
Adequate justification for absence of the environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided. 
Monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. ERA studies are 
therefore not required in accordance with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. 
The active substance (MSB111456, tocilizumab) is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter 
the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, MSB111456 is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical in vitro functional activity data support the biosimilarity of MSB111456 versus 
RoActemra-EU (and or Actemra-US) for both the SC and IV presentation.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical development programme included four clinical studies to evaluate the similarity between 
MSB11456 and the reference product (EU-RoActemra/US-Actemra), in terms of clinical pharmacology, 
efficacy, tolerability and safety.  
One pivotal comparative efficacy and safety Study FKS456-001 was conducted to compare the efficacy 
and safety of MSB11456 with EU-RoActemra after multiple fixed-dose SC administrations in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis. PK trough concentration samples were collected from all study patients at 
scheduled visits. 
Two comparative clinical PK studies were conducted to demonstrate PK comparability and similarity 
between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra/US-Actemra:  
• 
Pivotal 3-way comparative PK Study MS200740-0001: MSB11456 versus EU-RoActemra and 
versus US-Actemra after single SC administration in healthy subjects. 
• 
Pivotal 2-way comparative PK Study FKS456-002: MSB11456 versus US-Actemra after  
single IV infusion in healthy subjects. 
In addition, a supportive 2-way comparative PK Study FKS456-003 was conducted to demonstrate 
equivalence of the PK profile of MSB11456 administered by either an AI or a PFS after a single SC 
injection of 162 mg in healthy subjects, respectively. 
Immunogenicity was also evaluated in the clinical studies except for Study FKS456-003. 
Analytical methods 
Quantification of tocilizumab in human serum 
Quantification of tocilizumab in serum of healthy and RA patients was performed using an 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay.  
High bind 96-well MSD plates are coated with anti-idiotypic (Fab monovalent) antibody overnight to 
capture free tocilizumab and then blocked. The tocilizumab calibrators/QCs and samples are added to 
the plate and incubated. After washing to remove excess unbound molecules, wells are incubated with 
ruthenylated full immunoglobulin (lg), and the plate is incubated for formation of bridge. After final 
wash steps, the read buffer is added to the plate, and the plate is read with MSD reader to obtain raw 
responses.  
The first method developed had a wide calibration range from 103 ng/mL to 134000 ng/mL. This 
method was validated for sample analysis in healthy subjects. However, the method failed the 3-month 
long-term stability evaluation due to a high variability at the highest concentrations of the calibration 
curve. An investigation was initiated and a revised method with a shortened quantitation range (from 
100 to 50 000 ng/mL) but otherwise identical was tested and validated. 
Immunogenicity 
A multi-tiered approach to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralising antibodies (NAb) was 
applied. The same validated homogeneous electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging format 
incorporating an acid-dissociation sample pre-treatment step was applied for testing of samples from 
all three clinical studies, with minor changes to operating conditions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 45/126 
 
 
 
 
 
A cell-based assay dependent on the biological activity of hIL-6 was used to detect neutralising 
antibodies to tocilizumab. The cell-based NAb assay measures a luminescence signal induced by 
binding of rhIL-6 to IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) expressed on the surface of the Promega SIE-luc2p/HEK293 
cell line. MSB11456 binds to IL-6R, inhibiting the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and thereby reducing IL-6-
mediated signal transduction and luciferase activity. Anti-tocilizumab NAb binds to MB11456 to enable 
IL-6 to bind to its receptor and activate signaling pathway to increase luciferase activity and the 
luminescence signal.  
PK studies 
The pivotal data for demonstrating PK similarity with the reference product are obtained from two 
single-dose studies in healthy subjects: Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose 162 mg SC injection) and 
Study FKS456-002 (single-dose 8 mg/kg IV infusion). 
Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose SC injection):  
This study was a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, single-dose study to compare PK, PD, 
safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MSB11456 versus US-Actemra and EU-RoActemra in healthy 
adult subjects. 
A single dose of 162 mg of MSB11456, US-Actemra or EU-RoActemra was administered as a 
subcutaneous injection in the lower abdomen. 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by weight category (≥ 60 and ≤ 80 kg, > 80 and 
≤ 100 kg).  
Overall, 685 subjects received one single dose of MSB11456 (231 subjects), US-Actemra (229) or EU-
RoActemra (225 subjects) as a SC injection of 162 mg. Of the 685 subjects who received treatment 
and were included in the Safety Analysis set; 680 subjects (99.3%) were included in the PK Analysis 
set and 666 subjects (97.2%) completed the study. 
Sample sise re-estimation: Initially, 318 subjects were planned to be randomised (106 subjects per 
arm). A blinded sample re-estimation (BSSR) was conducted after 163 subjects completed the study 
up to Day 29, resulting in an increase of the sample size to up to 696 subjects.  
The primary PK endpoints were AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax. 
PK results:  
The mean tocilizumab concentrations over time for all 3 treatment arms are depicted in Figure 2. 
Following a single subcutaneous administration, mean tocilizumab serum concentrations increased 
rapidly and reached peak concentrations on Day 4 (96 hours) post-dose in all 3 treatments. Mean 
tocilizumab serum concentrations declined in a multi-exponential manner, with the last  
mean concentration above the LLOQ observed on Day 22 (504 hours) in all 3 treatments. Overall, the 
mean PK profiles were very similar and mostly overlapping among the 3 treatments.

The descriptive statistics for PK parameters by treatment group are presented in Table 3.  
Overall, the PK parameters were similar between MSB11456 and the reference products.

PK Analysis Set 
The statistical analysis results for the primary objectives to demonstrate PK similarity are presented in 
Table 4.  
For all primary PK parameters (AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax) and all pairwise treatment comparisons 
(MSB11456 versus US-Actemra; MSB11456 versus EU-RoActemra; and US-Actemra versus EU-
RoActemra), the 90% CIs for the geometric LS mean ratio were contained within the predefined 
80.00% to 125.00% similarity margin. 
The results from the primary PK analysis demonstrated PK similarity between MSB11456 and the 
reference products (EU-RoActemra and US-Actemra) as well as between the reference products.

Table 4 Statistical analysis results - PK Analysis Set
All PK parameters were additionally summarised by subgroups based on ADA status, NAb status, 
baseline weight, baseline BMI, and study centre. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the ANCOVA covariates, as well as PK 
outliers, on the statistical results, as planned in the IAP. Similarity was demonstrated between 
treatments for all sensitivity analyses, supporting the results from the primary analysis. 
Subgroup summaries of the PK parameters showed no apparent difference in primary PK parameters 
among the treatments for ADA positive, ADA negative, or NAb negative subgroups; the NAb positive 
subgroups were too small to draw any conclusions. 
For the weight and BMI categories, tocilizumab exposure was lower in the higher weight and BMI sub-
groups across the 3 treatments. In the study centre comparison, exposure in Study Centre 102 
appeared to be higher than that observed in Study Centre 101 in the MSB11456 treatment.  
Evaluation of the impact of missing AUC0-inf parameter on PK descriptive statistics: It was noted that in 
around 11 to 16% of subjects who participated in the study, it was not possible to calculate the 
terminal rate constant as described in the SAP. Consequently, the half-life and other associated 
parameters such as AUC0-inf and clearance could not be calculated for these subjects. An analysis was 
undertaken to determine why these PK parameters were missing and to investigate the possible impact 
of these missing data on PK descriptive statistics.

Study FKS456-002 (single-dose IV infusion):  
This study was a randomised, double-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, single-dose study designed to 
show PK similarity of MSB11456 with the reference product (US-Actemra) after a single IV infusion of 8 
mg/kg for 1 hour in healthy subjects. 
Subjects were randomised to receive a single IV infusion of 8 mg/kg of either MSB11456 or reference 
product (US-Actemra) for 1 hour. 
A total of 128 subjects received 1 IV dose of IMP (8 mg/kg tocilizumab), of which 62 subjects received 
1 IV dose of MSB11456 and 66 subjects received 1 IV dose of reference product. All 128 subjects 
completed the study.  
PK results: 
The mean tocilizumab serum concentrations versus time are presented in Figure 3.  
The overall shape of the arithmetic mean serum concentration-time profiles of tocilizumab was similar 
between MSB11456 and the reference product. Tocilizumab concentrations decreased gradually by a 
nonlinear, biphasic elimination (i.e., a combination of linear clearance and saturable elimination).

Overall, the PK parameters were similar between MSB11456 and the reference product.

The statistical analysis of the biosimilarity of MSB11456 versus US-Actemra for the primary PK 
endpoint (AUC0-last) and secondary PK parameters (Cmax and AUC0-inf) is presented in Table 6. 
For AUC0-last the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the 
conventional biosimilarity acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when comparing MSB11456 to US-
Actemra. PK similarity was additionally demonstrated for the secondary PK parameters AUC0-inf and 
Cmax. The GMRs (and 90% Cis) were 103.34 (98.53-108.37%) for AUC0-last, 103.15% (97.86-108.73%) 
for AUC0-inf and 101.48% (97.23-105.92%) for Cmax.  
Thus, PK similarity was demonstrated between MSB11456 and US-Actemra.

Study FKS456-003 (PFS vs AI):  
In addition to the pivotal PK studies, a supportive 2-way comparative PK Study FKS456-003 was 
conducted to demonstrate equivalence of the PK profile of MSB11456 administered by either a PFS or 
an AI after a single SC injection of 162 mg in healthy subjects, respectively.  
Study FKS456-003 was a randomised, open-label, single fixed-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, cross-over 
study in healthy male and female subjects.  
A single dose of 162 mg (180 mg/mL in 0.9 mL) MSB11456 was administered as an SC injection in the 
lower abdomen, upper thigh, or outer area of upper arm, using a PFS or an AI. 
PK results: 
The statistical analysis of the equivalence of AI and PFS presentations of MSB11456 is presented in the 
table below.

Table 7 Statistical analysis of bioequivalence of MSB11456 AI vs MSB11456 PFS - PK Analysis Set
For Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference 
products fell within the conventional bioequivalence acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when 
comparing the AI to the PFS. The GMRs (and 90% CIs) were 99.67% (90.95-109.21%) for Cmax, 
102.88% (92.21-114.79%) for AUC0-last, and 100.23% (92.67-108.41%) for AUC0-inf. 
Thus, PK equivalence was demonstrated between the PFS and AI presentations of MSB11456. Also, the 
secondary PK endpoints were comparable between PFS and AI presentations of MSB11456. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study FKS456-001 (RA patients): 
PK data were obtained from the phase III study FKS456-001 in patients with RA (using EU-
RoActemra). The blood samples were collected before tocilizumab administration at baseline, week 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and end of core treatment (week 24), extended by pre-dose samples at 
week 30, 42 and 52.  
At baseline, mean trough tocilizumab concentrations were below the limit of quantification in both the 
MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups. Steady-state was reached after 8-12 weeks. The mean trough 
tocilizumab concentrations in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups were sustained at week 24 of 
the Core Period (32058.4 ng/mL and 35442.8 ng/mL, respectively) and week 30 of the Overall Period 
(31005.9 ng/mL and 35478.9 ng/mL, respectively), with similar concentrations in the MSB11456 and 
EU-RoActemra groups.  
During the Overall Period, the mean trough concentration in the EU-RoActemra-to-MSB11456 group at 
week 24 was maintained at week 30 (35284.7 ng/mL) and was similar to the trough concentrations in 
the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups.

Absorption 
No data on absorption and bioavailability was generated specifically for MSB11456 throughout the 
development programme. The PK parameters indicative of rate and extent of absorption of tocilizumab 
after a single SC 162 mg MSB11456 dose administered via PFS in healthy subjects were fairly 
comparable between Study MS200740-0001 and FKS456-003. 
Table 11 Inter-study comparison of MSB11456 in serum - absorption and bioavailability PK metrics 
Following subcutaneous dosing in RA patients, the time to peak serum RoActemra concentrations tmax 
was 2.8 days. The bioavailability for the subcutaneous formulation was 79% (RoActemra SmPC, 2021). 
In adult patients with active RA, the mean steady-state Cmin concentration was 43.0 ± 19.8 μg/mL 
during weekly tocilizumab 162 mg treatment (RoActemra SmPC, 2021). This finding is deemed 
consistent with the mean trough steady-state tocilizumab concentrations of 32.1 ± 20.7 μg/mL and 
35.4 ± 20.4 μg/mL, respectively, after weekly 162 mg SC injection of MSB11456 or EU-RoActemra 
determined in efficacy and safety Study FKS456-001.

Distribution 
No data on distribution was generated specifically for MSB11456 throughout the development 
programme. For tocilizumab it was reported that the central volume of distribution was 3.72 L, the 
peripheral volume of distribution was 3.35 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 
7.07 L (RoActemra SmPC, 2021). 
Elimination 
Regarding elimination of tocilizumab following IV administration, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic 
elimination from the circulation. The total clearance of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent and is 
the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance 
plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is 
saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear 
clearance. 
Immunogenicity 
Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose SC injection): 
For ADA, 155 out of 231 subjects (67.1%) in the MSB11456 treatment; 123 out of 229 subjects 
(53.7%) in the US-Actemra treatment; and 148 out of 225 subjects (65.8%) in the EU-RoActemra 
treatment, had confirmed positive ADA test results.  
PK parameters, which were similar across the three treatment groups, were not influenced by ADA 
positive versus ADA negative status, consistent with the relatively low treatment-emergent ADA titres 
detected in all three treatment groups. Thus, ADA positive status did not have an impact on PK 
parameters for tocilizumab in this study.  
Table 12 Relationship between ADA positive vs ADA negative status and tocilizumab serum PK 
parameters - PK Analysis Set 
Study FKS456-002 (single-dose IV infusion): 
Nearly all subjects had at least 1 positive ADA result after dosing (i.e., on Day 15, Day 29, and/or 
EOS). This incidence was similar between subjects who received MSB11456 (57 out of 62 [91.9%] 
subjects) and US-Actemra (65 out of 66 [98.5%] subjects). Only 1 (1.6%) subject was positive for 
ADA prior to dosing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 54/126 
 
 
 
 
 
The ADA titre versus time profiles were similar across the two treatment groups; the median ADA titres 
were also similar and relatively low (60 to 240 depending on time point). 
Table 13 Summary of tocilizumab serum PK parameters for ADA positive subjects - PK Analysis Set 
Although a higher incidence of NAb positive samples was detected in Study FKS456-002 compared with 
Study MS200740-0001, the NAb positive incidence was still below 10%. 
The full set of PK parameters for ADA positive subjects in the MSB11456 and US-Actemra were similar; 
ADA negative incidence was too low to able comparison of the ADA positive versus ADA negative 
subpopulations in each treatment group. 
Study FKS456-001 (RA patients): 
A high incidence of ADA positive results was detected in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 
MSB11456 (97% of total ADA positive patients for week 0 to week 30) and EU-RoActemra (95.7%) 
and 97.1% for patients who switched from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 at week 24. ADA incidence 
appeared to peak at week 2 for both treatment groups. 
For the majority of patients, the absolute ADA titre values were relatively low, and similar to those 
detected in Study FKS456-002. For the overall treatment period of 30 weeks, geometric mean ADA 
titre for the three treatment arms was 118.8 for MSB11456, 99.9 for EU-RoActemra and 113.1 for 
patients who switched from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 at week 4. Thus, the magnitude of the ADA 
response to MSB11456 appeared similar to that for EU-RoActemra. 
PK trough concentrations stratified by ADA status throughout the Core Period (up to week 24) and up 
to week 30 of the Overall Period ( 
Figure 5) were similar between treatment groups.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tocilizumab is an IL-6Receptor (R) monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig)G1κ 
subclass directed against both the membrane-bound IL-6R (mIL-6R) and the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R). 
Tocilizumab binds specifically to both mIL-6R and sIL-6R and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated 
signaling through these receptors.  
Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose SC injection):  
This study was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, single-dose study to compare the PK/PD of 
a single 162 mg subcutaneous injection of MSB11456, US-Actemra or EU-RoActemra. 
The PD parameters included: Emax, AUE and tEmax for sIL-6R. Emax, AUE, tEmax, Emin and tEmin for serum 
CRP levels, using the high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). 
The results for sIL-6R similarity evaluation for the PD Analysis Set are presented below:

PD similarity was demonstrated for sIL-6R between MSB11456 and the reference products as well as 
between the reference products. 
For both sIL-6R PD parameters (Emax and AUE) and all pairwise treatment comparisons, the 90% CIs 
for the geometric LS mean ratio were contained within the 80.00% to 125.00% similarity margin. 
The results for CRP similarity evaluation for the PD Analysis Set are presented below:

Table 15 Results for CRP similarity evaluation for the PD Analysis Set 
Comparability was concluded for CRP PD parameters. Based on Emax and AUE, CRP exposure was 
comparable among the 3 treatment arms. The 90% CIs of the LS mean difference included zero for all 
pairwise treatment comparisons. For Emin, the 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratio were contained 
within the predefined 80.00% to 125.00% similarity margin in all pairwise treatment comparisons. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
Two bioanalytical methods for quantitation of tocilizumab in human serum were developed and 
validated. The first method failed the 3-month long-term stability evaluation due to a high variability at 
the highest concentrations of the calibration curve. In the revised second method the calibration range 
was shortened.  
Both analytical methods were used to analyse samples from the study MS200740-0001. The maximum 
concentration measured in the study was 24,800 ng/ml, which is below the selected upper limit of 
quantification (ULOQ) for the second method. It is agreed that the restriction of the calibration curve 
did not have an impact on sample analysis. Each PK sample from the study was analysed only with one 
Assessment report

method, and the corresponding concentration value reported. In the study, 5331 samples were 
analysed with the first method and 6246 samples were analysed with the second method. It is agreed 
that the ISR experiments performed during method validation demonstrated that the two assays are 
comparable and the two set of data can be combined. 
The method for the determination of soluble sIL-6R in human serum was proven to be precise and 
accurate over the concentration range 10.0 – 1000 ng/mL and is considered suitable for the analyses 
of soluble IL-6Rin human serum. 
A high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) assay was used in order to quantify CRP in serum samples as PD 
variable from PK/PD study MS200740-0001. The applicant provided description of the assay, assay 
verification, performance of the QC samples during the analysis period. All observed QC concentration 
were within acceptance criteria. The data provided by the applicant are considered sufficient by the 
CHMP.  
Since the CRP parameter is expected to be low in healthy subjects at baseline, no substantial changes 
in CRP levels can be observed in healthy volunteers after administration of tocilizumab. Given the low 
relevance of this biomarker in the evaluation of the tocilizumab PD comparability in healthy subjects, 
the provided supporting data are sufficient. 
The ADA assay is considered adequately validated for the intended purpose. Drug tolerance is 
considered adequate in relation to the mean drug trough concentration (approximately 35 μg 
tocilizumab/mL) measured at steady-state in Study FKS456-001.   
The NAb assay has lower sensitivity compared to the ADA assay. As the ADA assay is considered 
acceptable to detect differences in immunogenicity a new NAb method is not requested. 
PK studies 
The pivotal data for demonstrating PK similarity with the reference medicinal product are obtained 
from two single-dose studies in healthy volunteers: Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose 162 mg SC 
injection) and Study FKS456-002 (single-dose 8 mg/kg IV infusion). In addition, a supportive 2-way 
comparative PK Study FKS456-003 was conducted to demonstrate equivalence of the PK profile of 
MSB11456 administered by either an AI or a PFS after a single SC injection of 162 mg in healthy 
subjects, respectively. 
MS200740-0001: 
The study design is satisfactory.   
The subjects included in this study were to weigh between 60 and 100 kg to ensure that PK 
parameters between subjects were as similar as possible. In addition to including a limited range of 
body weights, subjects were stratified by weight category (≥ 60 and ≤ 80 kg, or > 80 and ≤ 100 kg) 
during randomisation and weight category was included in the statistical analyses as a covariate. This 
is adequate. 
MSB11456 was administered at the same dose and via the same route as EU-RoActemra or US-
Actemra for subcutaneous formulation. The selected dose is acceptable. 
A blinded sample size re-estimation was conducted resulting in an increase of the sample size. The 
blinded sample re-estimation was in general supported by the CHMP in a scientific advice. The study 
protocol was amended (CSP Version 4.0, amendment 3) so that the total sample size could be 
increased up to a maximum of 696 randomised subjects to yield 220 evaluable subjects per arm 
(based upon 65% GeoCV and dropout rate of 5%).  
The primary PK parameters included AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax. The PK parameters are adequate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 59/126 
 
 
 
 
The secondary PK parameters included AUC0-72, AUCextra%, tmax, tlast, λz, t½, and CL/F up to 48 days 
post-dose. Parameter AUC0-72 has been selected as supportive partial AUC to ensure the similar 
exposure of tocilizumab until the approximate appearance of maximal levels between products.  
However, the Scientific Advice was given to evaluate partial AUCs (not only AUC0-72) reflecting the 
linear and non-linear phases in in study MS200740-0001 (see EMEA/H/SA/3323/1/2016/III; CHMP 
answer to Question 1 c and EMA/SA/0000060099, 2021). The clearance of tocilizumab is concentration 
dependent and consists from linear and non-linear clearance. If the reference mAb is eliminated both 
by target-mediated and non-target mediated mechanisms, comparable PK should be demonstrated 
where each mechanism of clearance predominates (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). The applicant 
did not provide calculations for partials AUCs to compare portions of linear/nonlinear clearance 
between test and reference product due to difficulties with establishing a timeframe reflecting the 
linear and non-linear clearance. Taking into account that the provided studies demonstrated similarity 
for PK parameters after single lower dose (SC), higher dose (IV) and also for multiple doses in the 
treatment regimen once weekly, this issue regarding partial AUCs has not been pursued further. 
For all primary PK parameters (AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax) and all pairwise treatment comparisons 
(MSB11456 versus US-Actemra; MSB11456 versus EU-RoActemra; and US-Actemra versus EU-
RoActemra), the 90% CIs for the GMRs were contained within the predefined 80.00-125.00% similarity 
margin.  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of the ANCOVA covariates, as well as PK 
outliers, on the statistical results, as planned in the IAP. Similarity was demonstrated between 
treatments for all sensitivity analyses, supporting the results from the primary analysis. 
Also, the secondary PK endpoints were comparable between MSB11456 and the reference products. 
The exclusion of subjects with missing AUC0-inf values was prespecified in the protocol. Exclusion of 
subjects with missing AUC0-inf parameter did not influence the overall study results, and tocilizumab PK 
remained similar across treatment groups. 
FKS456-002: 
The study design is satisfactory.  
The applicant has previously sought CHMP advice on the development programme, and principally 
followed the received recommendations. As pointed in the scientific advice 
EMEA/H/SA/3323/1/2016/III dated 26th of May 2016, use of a non-EU licensed reference product can 
be acceptable as comparator in a clinical study if a comprehensive comparability exercise concerning 
quality characteristics, biological activity and PK equivalence study has established an acceptable 
bridge between the reference products. Analytical similarity studies scientifically justifying the 
relevance of comparative data between US-Actemra and EU-RoActemra and establish the requisite 
scientific bridge between these have been performed, please refer to Section 2.4. Therefore, the use of 
US-Actemra as a comparator in the IV PK study FK 456-002 is acceptable. 
Analytical similarity studies scientifically justifying the relevance of comparative data between US-
Actemra and EU-RoActemra and establishing the requisite scientific bridge between these have been 
performed, please refer to the section 2.4. Therefore, the use of US-Actemra as a comparator in the 
study is acceptable. 
The chosen dose of 8 mg/kg IV infusion for 1 hour in this study reflects the current recommended 
maintenance dose for Actemra in adults with RA. The selected dose is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 60/126 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was selected to be AUC0-last. In addition, Cmax and AUC0-inf were included as 
standard PK endpoints. The PK parameters are adequate. The PK parameters tmax, λz, t1/2, and CL were 
also measured.  
For AUC0-last the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the 
conventional biosimilarity acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when comparing MSB11456 to US-
Actemra. PK similarity was additionally demonstrated for the secondary PK parameters AUC0-inf and 
Cmax. The GMRs (and 90% Cis) were 103.34 (98.53-108.37%) for AUC0-last, 103.15% (97.86-108.73%) 
for AUC0-inf and 101.48% (97.23-105.92%) for Cmax.  
Thus, PK similarity was demonstrated between MSB11456 and US-Actemra. Also, the secondary PK 
endpoints were comparable between AI and PFS presentations of MSB11456. 
FKS456-003: 
The study design is satisfactory.   
The chosen dose of 162 mg MSB11456 and SC route of administration in this study is the approved 
dose for the tested presentations (i.e., AI and PFS), and reflect the recommended EU-RoActemra dose 
given weekly (or every other week) in adults with RA. This dose has also been administered to healthy 
subjects without posing any safety concerns. The selected dose is acceptable. 
The primary parameters were AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and Cmax. The PK parameters are adequate.  
For AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference 
products fell within the conventional bioequivalence acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when 
comparing the AI to the PFS. The GMRs (and 90% CIs) were 99.67% (90.95-109.21%) for Cmax, 
102.88% (92.21-114.79%) for AUC0-last, and 100.23% (92.67-108.41%) for AUC0-inf. 
Thus, PK equivalence was demonstrated between the AI and PFS presentations of MSB11456. Also, the 
secondary PK endpoints were comparable between AI and PFS presentations of MSB11456. 
Elimination 
In the case of tocilizumab, the total clearance is concentration-dependent and is the sum of linear 
(non-target mediated) clearance and nonlinear (target-mediated) clearance. 
The target is also present in healthy subjects and so is target-mediated clearance but it can be a 
different magnitude in effect when there is more target in patients.  
For MSB11456, the clearance of tocilizumab has been characterised for both doses and routes of 
administration in the submitted PK studies. This is in accordance with the guideline criteria. The choice 
of study design including choice of dose, sampling scheme and PK endpoints is adequate.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Ctrough is the only PK parameter in the phase 3 study. Ctrough at different time points during the 
treatment can be used as a supportive PK parameter without any statistical analysis.  
PK between a biosimilar product and the reference product can usually be investigated in adequately 
designed and conducted PK studies in healthy volunteers; supportive PK data from clinical efficacy and 
safety studies should usually be collected as well. As noted above, there is a pronounced target-
mediated clearance for tocilizumab which could be larger in the target population. In Study FKS456-
001, values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were imputed as ½LLOQ (50 ng/ml). The 
proportion of patients with trough concentration below LLOQ at each time point is similar for all 
treatment groups from baseline to week 12. It is agreed that the small numerical differences between 
the treatment groups are not considered to be significant. Similar mean trough concentrations 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 61/126 
 
 
 
 
measured over the time, in particular until week 12 confirm that the target-mediated clearance is 
comparable between treatment arms. 
A small difference in mean trough concentration is observed between the MSB11456 and EU-
RoActemra arms from week 12 and onwards, and a decreased concentration is observed among 
patients who switch from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 (at week 24) from week 30 and onwards.  
The difference in mean trough concentration may be related to the difference in ADAs from week 24 
onwards.  
Immunogenicity 
ADAs have an impact on the PK of tocilizumab but the response was similar for MSB11456 and EU-
RoActemra.  
In patients given multiple doses, a small difference in mean trough concentration is observed between 
the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra arms from week 12 and onwards, and a decreased concentration is 
observed among patients who switch from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 (at week 24) from week 30 
and onwards. The difference in mean trough concentration may be related to the difference in ADAs 
from week 24 onwards. The CHMP is of the opinion that this has no impact on the biosimilarity 
comparison. 
Study FKS456-001: The incidence of treatment-induced ADA for the overall period is similar between 
the treatment groups, however the incidence at various timepoints is generally higher for MSB11456. 
Median ADA titres at week 52 are lower for the EU-RoActemra arm, compared to the MSB11456 arm. 
The difference in ADAs from week 24 onwards is likely to have an impact on the serum tocilizumab 
concentration for the MSB11456 vs EU-RoActemra vs EU-RoActemra/MSB1146 treatment groups. 
However, as the SD for the three arms is wide and overlapping, it is not likely to be clinically relevant.  
Special populations and interaction studies 
No patients over the age of 55 were included in the PK studies, which is acceptable.  
No clinical studies in special populations or interaction studies were submitted, which is acceptable for 
a biosimilar.  
In the SmPC for MSB11456, the information in Section 4.5 “Interaction with other medicinal products 
and other forms of interaction” and Section “5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties” is the same as in the EU-
RoActemra SmPC; and this is acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No validated PD marker exists that would be predictive of efficacy of tocilizumab in patients. However, 
the analysis of PD marker(s) as secondary endpoints in the clinical studies is considered supportive of 
similarity. In that regard, CRP, total IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor, lipids (cholesterol and low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol) and absolute neutrophil count are relevant PD markers. 
The pharmacodynamic comparability in terms of sIL-6R and CRP has been demonstrated in PK/PD 
study MS200740-001 between MSB11456 and reference product EU-RoActemra.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pivotal data for demonstrating PK similarity with the reference medicinal product are obtained 
from two single-dose studies in healthy volunteers: Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose 162 mg SC 
injection) and Study FKS456-002 (single-dose 8 mg/kg IV infusion). The available single-dose PK/PD 
data support biosimilarity of MSB11456 versus the EU-reference product RoActemra.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study FKS456-001 does not contain any dose response data. The clinical trial included however, 
according to the applicant, some PK assessments. Steady state PK of MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra 
were compared by evaluating serum through concentrations (Ctrough) of tocilizumab over time in all 
patients. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Title of study: A Randomized, Double-blind, Multiple-dose, Parallel-group, Two-arm Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of MSB11456 Compared to European Union‒approved 
RoActemra® in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (APTURA I Study) 
Methods 
The pivotal study FKS456-001 was  1:1 randomised, double-blind, two arm study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MSB11456 compared to EU-RoActemra in patients with 
moderately to severely active RA (APTURA I study). The study included 604 patients with RA, 302 
patients in each arm that were randomised to either MSB11456 or EU-RoActemra in prefilled syringe 
with a weekly injection of 162 mg subcutaneously (SC). Study FKS456-001 consists of a Screening 
period, a double-blind 24-week Core Treatment Period followed by an additional 28-week double-blind 
Extended Treatment Period and a 12-week Safety Evaluation Period. The schematic trial design is 
presented in Figure 6.

Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
The study population consisted of male or female patients aged ≥18 years old with moderately to 
severely active RA and inadequate response to therapy with at least one disease modifying anti-
rheumatic drug (DMARD, either synthetic or biologic) and who were receiving a stable dose of 
methotrexate. The diagnosis of RA had to be made according to the revised 1987 American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Classification 2010 criteria. 
Disease duration had to be ≥6 months prior to the Screening Visit. Moderately to severely active RA 
was defined by Swollen Joint Count ≥6 (66 joint count) and Tender Joint Count ≥6 (68 joint count) at 
screening and randomisation, radiographic evidence of  ≥1 joint with a definite erosion attributable to 
RA at screening and C-reactive protein ≥1 mg/dL (≥10 mg/L) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
≥28 mm/hour at screening. Previous use of any interleukin-6 (IL-6) acting drugs, targeted synthetic 
DMARDs like janus kinase inhibitors, any biological agent for a condition other than RA and more than 
two biologic treatments for RA were not allowed. 
Exclusion criteria 
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis classified as ACR functional class IV were excluded, as were patients 
with rheumatic autoimmune disease or inflammatory joint disease other than rheumatoid arthritis. 
Patients who had prior use of targeted synthetic DMARDs, more than 2 biologic treatments for 
rheumatoid arthritis, or any biological agent for a condition other than rheumatoid arthritis were also 
excluded.  
The study enrolled patients from 81 investigative sites in Europe (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, 
Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Serbia, and Slovakia). The study enrolment went from 03 Aug 
2020-11 Oct 2021.  
Treatments 
Patients were assigned to the study drug in accordance with the randomisation schedule and received 
either MSB11456 or EU-RoActemra at a dose of 162 mg by SC injection starting at Day 1, then weekly 
up to Week 51. Randomisation was stratified by previous exposure to biologic treatment for RA. 
Patients who discontinued treatment early or violated the protocol were asked to continue to be 
followed for all regularly scheduled visits for safety and efficacy assessments up to the end of the 
corresponding treatment period. If a patient discontinued study drug prior to Week 24, the patient 
remained in the study up to the completion of the Week 24 assessments to allow for the collection of 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity data for the assessment of similarity for a full 24-week period 
before switching occurs. Visits at site were on Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, 42 and 52. The first 3 
doses of MSB11456 (162 mg at Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15) were administered on site to ensure that 
the patient, or their caregiver was appropriately trained. The subsequent 2 doses (on Day 22 and Day 
29) were also administered on site in the Czech Republic as per a request from the Czech Regulatory 
Authority. Patients were monitored for 2 hours following onsite administration. If, after proper training, 
the healthcare professional judged it appropriate, the patient (or a trained caregiver) could inject the 
following weekly doses of the MSB11456/ EU-RoActmera at home. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was:  
to demonstrate equivalent efficacy of the proposed biosimilar tocilizumab MSB11456 and EU-
RoActemra both administered SC to patients with moderately to severely active RA. 
The secondary objective was:  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 64/126 
 
 
 
 
to compare the safety, immunogenicity, and long-term efficacy of MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra. 
The explanatory objectives were: 
1)  to explore the effect of a single treatment transition (i.e., in patients, who transitioned from 
EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 at Week 24) on efficacy, safety and immunogenicity and  
2)  to describe PK parameters of MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The study endpoints as pre-specified in the study protocol are summarised in Table 16. 
Additionally, the applicant states that, based on the International Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) addendum on estimands and 
sensitivity analysis in clinical trials and to the guideline on statistical principles for clinical trials (ICH, 
2019), the study objective  and  endpoints  described  in  the  study  protocol  have  been  translated  
into  key  clinical  questions  of  interest  by  means  of  the  estimands  framework  in  the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) as  agreed with both FDA and EMA prior to partial database lock and unblinding for 
the Week 30 analyses, see Statistical Methods section. 
Table 16 Study endpoints of study FKS456-001 
Sample size 
A sample size of 542 randomised patients (271 patients per arm) was chosen to provide approximately 
460 patients (230 per arm) in the PP Analysis Set at Week 24, assuming a 15% drop-out rate 
(including major protocol deviations). The applicants states that this was based on the EMA 
recommendation a total of 460 evaluable patients (230 per arm) that would provide 90% power to 
demonstrate equivalence between treatments for the primary endpoint, with equivalence margins of 
±0.6 and a Type I error of 2.5%, assuming no difference between the 2 treatment groups and a 
common standard deviation of 1.76.  
In addition, this sample size would provide more than 80% power to demonstrate that the 95% CI for 
the difference between treatments in the key secondary endpoint (ACR20 response rate at Week 24) 
would be included in the equivalence interval [-15%, +15%], assuming no difference between the 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023

treatment groups and that both MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra have an ACR20 response rate of 60% at 
Week 24. The actual number of patients finally enrolled was 604 (302 in ach treatment arm) 
marginally superseding the 10% over-enrolment. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Patients with RA whose eligibility was confirmed at baseline were randomised 1:1 in a blinded fashion 
through an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to receive either MSB11456 or the EU-
RoActemra. Randomisation was stratified by previous exposure to biologic treatment for rheumatoid 
arthritis. Patients who previously received 1 or 2 biologic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis were 
capped at 10% of the total study population. According to the applicant randomisation data were kept 
strictly confidential, accessible only to authorised staff, until the time of unblinding. 
Participants and personnel involved in the conduct and the interpretation of the study were blinded to 
the participants’ randomised treatment assignment during the study. Likewise, the double-blind nature 
of this study was maintained because at Week 24, after all efficacy and safety assessments were 
performed, all patients remaining on the investigational medical product (IMP) were re-randomised, 
including those in the MSB11456 group whose re-randomisation to continue the same treatment. Each 
IMP (MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra) syringe was blinded. Blinded labelled treatment kits were 
provided to each study site. 
Statistical methods 
The applicant states that the statistical analysis plan (SAP) detailing the statistical analyses were 
finalised prior to the Week 30 partial database lock. 
The primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 was conducted after all patients had completed the Week 30 
assessments or had withdrawn from the study before Week 30. 
Analysis populations 
Safety and immunogenicity data were listed and summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics on 
the Safety Analysis Set (SAF) and Extended Period Safety (EP-Safety) Analysis Set. Descriptive 
statistics were provided for results of the PK exploratory analyses (i.e., trough concentrations). The 
study analysis sets of FKS456-001 are presented in Table 17.

Intercurrent events (ICE) 
The primary, key secondary, and early efficacy (Week 12) estimands were defined in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) with all of its attributes.  
The following intercurrent events were defined:  
•Treatment discontinuation or interruption due to AEs in patients with an IMP compliance of <80%; 
•IMP discontinuation due to lack of efficacy;  
•IMP discontinuation due to any other reason;  
•Prohibited medications; 
•Dose modification of methotrexate;  
•COVID-19 vaccination;

Estimand and analyses 
Primary Estimand 1.0 (DAS28-ESR Intent-to-Treat [ITT]) targeted the effect of study drug on the 
variable measurement regardless of adherence to the study drug or to the protocol, including use of 
prohibited medication prior to Week 24 and followed a ‘treatment policy’ strategy for all intercurrent 
events. Missing DAS28-ESR scores at Week 24 were imputed by a multiple imputation procedure under 
a MAR assumption. Nonmonotone missing data were imputed first, then the monotone missing values 
for each treatment group were imputed via the chained equation method. First, all missing data for the 
first post-baseline visit were imputed; then missing data for the next visit were imputed using 
observed data plus the just imputed missing data; and so on to the Week 24 visit. Baseline DAS28-
ESR score and the randomisation stratification variable were used to model the distribution of 
trajectory values. Imputed DAS28-ESR scores were restricted such that the values were greater than 
zero.  
The change from baseline at Week 24 in DAS28-ESR was analysed using an analysis of covariance with 
treatment group and previous exposure to biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis [yes/no] as fixed 
effects and baseline DAS28-ESR as a covariate. The stratification variable was used as entered in IRT. 
The difference between treatments was estimated by the least squares (LS) mean difference between 
MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra, with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The CI was compared with the 
equivalence interval of [-0.6, 0.6]. 
Supportive Estimand 1.1 (DAS28-ESR Per Protocol [PP]) targeted the effect of study drug on the 
variable measurement in the target population of those patients who adhered to the protocol and did 
not experience any clinically important protocol deviations impacting the primary endpoint.No 
imputation of missing data was performed.The same ANCOVA analysis as used for the primary 
estimand was performed on the PP Analysis Set. All data available were included in the analysis. 
Supportive Estimand 1.2 (DAS28-ESR hypothetical return-to-baseline ITT) targeted the effect of 
study drug on the variable measurement in the target population as if the patient who discontinued or 
interrupted study drug due to study-related events (lack of efficacy or AE in patients with a study drug 
compliance of <80%) or took prohibited medication or had any methotrexate dose modification would 
no longer benefit from study drug. Measurements were projected as a worst case scenario, as if the 
patient’s DAS28-ESR value returned to baseline levels immediately after the time of the intercurrent 
event (‘hypothetical’ strategy). For other intercurrent events, a treatment policy strategy was followed. 
Imputation of missing DAS28-ESR values at Week 24 and imputation of discounted values due to the 
occurrence of relevant intercurrent events were based on a pattern-mixture model combining a 
baseline observation carried forward multiple imputation approach with missing at random (MAR) 
sequential imputation. For other missing data, MAR sequential imputation was used (as for the primary 
estimand). A similar analysis as for the primary estimand was performed with the exception that 
measurements that occurred after selected intercurrent events were not considered in the analysis.  
Supportive Estimand 1.3 (DAS28-ESR hypothetical continuing per protocol ITT) targeted the effect 
of study drug on the variable measurement in the target population as if the patient who discontinued 
study drug for any reason or took prohibited medication or had any methotrexate dose modification, 
continued to follow the protocol after the time of the intercurrent event. Thus, for these intercurrent 
events, a ‘hypothetical’ strategy was followed where measurements were projected as a per protocol 
scenario. For the other intercurrent events, a treatment policy was followed. 
A similar analysis as for the primary estimand was performed, with the exception that the following 
DAS28-ESR assessments were discounted and those now missing visits were imputed using multiple 
imputation as in the primary analysis: DAS28-ESR values that occurred after treatment discontinuation 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 68/126 
 
 
 
 
due to any reason and DAS28-ESR values that occurred after use of prohibited medication (or 
modification of permitted medications) that could impact Week 24 efficacy. 
The following sensitivity analyses on the primary estimand were performed on the ITT population: 
•  no imputation of missing values. 
• 
a tipping point analysis, based on the same analysis of covariance model as for the primary 
analysis.  
The Key Secondary Estimand 2.0 (ACR20 ITT) targeted the effect of study drug on the variable 
measurement regardless of adherence to the study drug or to the protocol, including use of prohibited 
medication prior to Week 24 and followed a ‘treatment policy’ strategy for all intercurrent events. 
Missing ACR20 response data were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. 
All missing ACR20 assessments were imputed using the last non-missing assessment. Patients who 
had just a baseline assessment had their postbaseline assessments imputed as non-responders. LOCF 
was proposed because few missing ACR assessments were expected at Week 24. However, a 
sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation was proposed to address any situation in which there was 
a large number of missing values at Week 24. 
The difference in ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was compared using a 95% stratified Newcombe CI 
to adjust for the stratification factor previous exposure to biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis 
[yes/no] and assessed against an equivalence margin of [-15%, 15%]. Mantel-Haenszel weights were 
used to combine the stratum components. 
Supportive Estimand 2.1 (ACR20 PP) targeted the effect of study drug on the variable measurement 
in the target population of those patients who adhered to the protocol and did not experience any 
clinically important protocol deviations. The same analysis method as the key secondary estimand was 
performed on the PP Analysis Set. No patients in the PP Analysis Set had missing ACR20 data at Week 
24. 
Supportive Estimand 2.2 (ACR20 hypothetical non-responder ITT) targeted the effect of study drug 
on the variable measurement in the target population as if the patient who discontinued or interrupted 
study drug due to study-related events (lack of efficacy or AE in patients with a study drug compliance 
of <80%) or took prohibited medication or had any methotrexate dose modification would no longer 
benefit from study drug. Measurements were projected as a worst case scenario, as if the patient’s 
ACR20 was considered as a nonresponse immediately after the time of the intercurrent event 
(‘hypothetical’ strategy). For other intercurrent events, a treatment policy strategy was followed. 
A similar analysis as for the Key Secondary Estimand 2.0 was carried out with the exception that 
measurements that occurred after selected intercurrent events were not considered in the analysis. 
Imputation of missing ACR20 response data at Week 24 and imputation of discounted values due to 
the occurrence of relevant intercurrent events was based on a combination of a non-responders 
approach with LOCF. The non-responders approach was used for patients who discontinued from IMP 
prior to Week 24 due to lack of efficacy or due to an AE and/or for patients who used prohibited 
medication or modified their permitted medications prior to Week 24. For other missing data, LOCF 
was used (as for the key secondary estimand). 
The following sensitivity analyses on the Key Secondary Estimand were performed on the ITT 
population: 
•  No imputation.  
•  Missing ACR20 values were imputed using a multiple imputation approach.  
•  A tipping point analysis

Early (Week 12) efficacy estimands Supportive Estimand 3.0, Supportive Estimand 3.1, and 
Supportive Estimand 3.2 were constructed based on DAS28-ESR at Week 12 with the same 
attributes as Primary Estimand 1.0, Supportive Estimand 1.1, and Supportive Estimand 1.3 
respectively. 
Type-I Error Control 
There was no adjustment for multiplicity because this study had only one primary endpoint, and study 
success were evaluated according to the success criterion defined for each agency. 
Analyses of Subgroups 
Analyses on the primary and key secondary estimands (Estimand 1.0, and Estimand 2.0 as described 
above) were to be performed for the following subgroups using the same methods as the main 
analyses, removing the strata from the model, when applicable: 
• 
Previous exposure to biologic treatment for RA [yes/no]  
•  ADA positive/ADA negative  
•  Neutralising antibody (NAb) positive/NAb negative  
•  Non COVID-19 vaccinated/COVID-19 vaccinated prior to Week 24 
•  Non COVID-19 vaccinated/COVID-19 vaccinated prior to Week 12 for Estimand 3.0 (DAS28 
ESR at Week 12) 
Of note: Previous exposure to biologic treatment for RA and COVID-19 vaccinated, subgroup analyses 
were to be performed only if at least 10% of the ITT or PP set in each subgroup. ADA or NAb status 
were defined as positive for a complete study period if the patient had at least 1 confirmatory positive 
result post-dose any time during this period. Otherwise, the status was defined as negative for this 
complete study period. A forest plots were to be displayed with the analysis by each of the subgroups 
as well as overall. 
Secondary analyses 
For secondary and other efficacy variables, mixed-effect repeated measure models were employed for 
the analysis of longitudinal continuous data. The fixed effects of treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit 
interaction, and stratification factor were included in the model and the 95% CI of the LS mean was 
provided for each time point.  
Categorical variables were summarised descriptively. The Core Period tables utilised the ITT and PP 
Analysis Sets, and the Extended Period tables utilised the Extended Period Intent-to-Treat (EP-ITT 
Analysis Set).  
Results 
Participant flow 
Subject disposition in Study FKS456-001 is summarised Figure 7. Of the 908 patients screened, a total 
of 604 patients were randomised to receive study drug administered SC according to the randomised 
treatment (302 per arm) and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. According to the applicant 
similar proportions of patients in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups discontinued study drug 
prior to Week 24 (35 [11.6%] and 26 [8.6%], respectively). The main reasons for discontinuing study 
drug prior to Week 24 in both groups included AE(s) and withdrawal of consent from treatment. 
Overall, similar proportions of patients in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups were rerandomised 
in the Extended Treatment Period (267/302 [88.4%] and 276/302 [91.4%] of patients, respectively), 
and most patients (541/543 [99.6%]) received study drug during the Extended Treatment Period.

The applicants further states that other than 1 patient who received 1 dose of EU-RoActemra instead of 
MSB11456 at Week 25, all patients received study drug according to the re-randomised treatment and 
were included in the EP-SAF Analysis Set: 266 patients who continued MSB11456; 139 patients who 
transitioned from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456, and 136 patients who continued EU-RoActemra. 
Hereafter, these treatment groups will be referred to as the MSB11456 group, the EU-RoActemra / 
MSB11456 group, and the EU-RoActemra group, respectively, in the context of the Overall or Extended 
Treatment Periods. 
In the EP-SAF Analysis Set, study drug was ongoing at Week 30 in similar proportions of patients in 
each treatment group (approximately 95.0% of patients overall). The main reason for discontinuing 
study drug during the Extended Treatment Period prior to Week 30 was AE(s) in all treatment groups.

Recruitment 
The study period for enrolment went from 03 Aug 2020- 11 Oct 2021. The study enrolled patients from 
81 investigative sites in Europe (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, 
Russia, Serbia, and Slovakia). 
Conduct of the study 
Up to the time of unblinding for this Week 30 CSR, there were 2 global amendments of  
the original protocol. In addition, local amendments were implemented. The two substantial global 
amendments are summarised below: 
Protocol Version 2.0 (Global Amendment 1; substantial), dated 06 May 2020:  
-Measures implemented to increase safeguarding for the patients due to COVID19 pandemic  
▪ Implementation of risk minimisation and the mitigation plan for COVID-19.  
▪ Provision of a separate ICF to inform patients of the nature and impact of COVID-19.  
▪ Updates to the exclusion criteria to exclude patients with confirmed or suspected active COVID-19 
infection and to ensure that the investigator specifically evaluates the patient’s eligibility taking into 
consideration COVID-19 risk factors and situation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 72/126 
 
 
 
 
 
▪ Provided details of action to take with the IMP due to COVID-19 and confirmed details of COVID-19 
AE/SAE reporting.  
▪ Permitted the inclusion of local laboratories (with preapproval of the Sponsor) instead of central 
laboratories, if required due to the COVID-19 situation.  
-Further details of injection site reactions and reporting, and instructions for the investigator to t if 
such reaction had occurred since the last assessment. 
- Replaced predefined AESIs with a statement that any AEs that lead to interruption of IMP, permanent 
discontinuation of IMP, or withdrawal from the study will be considered predefined AESIs 
Protocol Version 3.0 (Global Amendment 2; substantial), dated 01 Feb 2021:  
-Added that COVID-19 vaccination was not allowed from 4 weeks prior to  
randomisation until the completion of the Week 30 visit (COVID-19‒related  
protocol deviation)  
-Removed details regarding North America, Asia, and the Rest of the World,  
including stratification by geographical region, as the study was being conducted  
in Europe only.  
Baseline data 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the trial population (ITT population) are 
summarised in Table 19 and Table 20 respectively. The applicant states that baseline demographics 
and baseline disease characteristics were similar for the PP Analysis Set compared to the ITT Analysis 
Set.

Analysis Set had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis ≥6 months prior to the Screening visit and 
were ACR functional Class I to Class III.  
Overall, similar proportions of patients in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups (9.3% and 8.6% 
respectively) had previous exposure to any biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Likewise, the 
applicant states that a similar proportion of patients in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups 
received COVID 19 vaccination prior to the Week 12 visit (5.6% and 6.6% respectively) and prior to 
the Week 24 visit (11.6% and 9.9% respectively).  
Regarding extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, 17.7% of patients were known to 
have rheumatoid nodules, 4.5% secondary Sjogrens Syndrome, and 1.8% of patients were known to 
have peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of each of the other extra articular manifestations was 
≤1.0%, Table 21.

Table 22 continued Rheumatoid arthritis history- Core period (ITT analysis set) 
Prior medication 
Prior medications defined as any medication discontinued prior to the first dose of study drug, had 
been taken by 76.5% of patients in the ITT Analysis Set. The most commonly reported prior 
medications were those taken for the rheumatoid arthritis disease under study. Prior medication taken 
by ≥ 5% of the patients in either treatment group is presented in Table 23. 
The applicant further states that COVID-19 vaccines were reported as prior medications for 5 patients 
in the ITT Analysis Set, 4 (1.3%) patients in the MSB11456 group and 1 (0.3%) patient in the EU-
RoActemra group. As already described prior biologic medications for the disease under study were 
taken by less than 10% of patients n=54) and included the selective immunosuppressant abatacept, 
and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab 
pegol, certolizumab, and ABP501 (i.e. biosimilar amgevita). 
Of note, to be eligible for the study, all patients had to have been treated with methotrexate for at 
least 12 consecutive weeks immediately prior to randomisation and were on a stable dose of between 
Assessment report

10 and 25 mg/week methotrexate for the last 8 weeks prior to screening. The dose and route of 
administration of methotrexate at study entry was to be continued without change during the study, in 
particular during the 52-week treatment period of the study. 
Table 23 Prior medication taken by ≥ 5% of the patients in either treatment group (ITT analysis set) 
Numbers analysed 
The ITT Analysis Set (n=604) was used as the primary analysis set for efficacy and was used for all 
primary, secondary and other efficacy endpoint analyses. 
The PP Analysis Set (n= 497) was used as a sensitivity analysis for the primary, secondary and other 
efficacy endpoint analysis.  
The Safety Analysis Set (n=604) was used for all secondary and other safety, and immunogenicity 
endpoints analyses. Among the 604 patients included in the Safety Analysis Set for the Overall Period 
(Day 1 to Week 30), 541 patients were included in the Extension period -Safety Analysis Set for the 
Extended Period (Week 24 to Week 30).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint and primary estimand 1.0 
The primary endpoint, i.e., DAS28-ESR change from baseline at Week 24 (Primary Estimand 1.0) in 
the ITT Analysis Set is summarised in Table 25. The difference between treatment groups was 
estimated by the least squared (LS) mean difference between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra, with its 
95% CI for the EMA (equivalence interval of [-0.6, 0.6]) and its 90% CI for the FDA (equivalence 
interval of [-0.6, 0.5]). LS mean decreases in DAS28-ESR from baseline were present at Week 24 in 
both the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra treatment groups for the ITT Analysis Set.  
The results of the statistical analysis of the primary estimand showed no difference between MSB11456 
and EU-RoActemra, with the 95% CIs for the differences in DAS28-ESR change from baseline at Week 
24 between groups fully included within the respective predefined equivalence intervals, Table 25.

Supportive Estimand 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 
The statistical analysis of Supportive Estimand 1.1 was conducted in the PP Analysis Set. The results of 
the statistical analysis of Supportive Estimand 1.1 were similar to those of Primary Estimand 1.0, i.e., 
and the 95% CIs for the differences in change from baseline between treatment groups fully included 
the respective predefined equivalence intervals. 
DAS28-ESR change from baseline at Week 24 in the ITT Analysis Set (Supportive Estimand 1.2) is 
targeted the effect of study drug on the variable measurement in the target population as if the patient 
who discontinued or interrupted study drug due to study-related events (lack of efficacy or AE in 
patients with a study drug compliance of < 80%) or took prohibited medication or had any 
methotrexate dose modification would no longer benefit from study drug. The results of the statistical 
analysis of Supportive Estimand 1.2 showed no differences between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra, 
with the 95% CIs for the differences in change from baseline between groups fully included within the 
respective predefined equivalence intervals. Likewise the analysis of DAS28-ESR change from baseline 
at Week 24 in the ITT Analysis Set (Supportive Estimand 1.3) showed no difference between 
MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra, with the 95% CIs for the differences in change from baseline between 
groups fully included within the respective predefined equivalence intervals.  
An overview of all results of the statistical analyses of primary Estimands and supportive Estimands 
1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 is presented in Figure 8 Estimands 1: 95% CI for the LS mean difference in change 
from baseline to week 24 in DAS28-ESR between MSB11456 and EU-Roactemra.

Sensitivity analyses 
No Imputation 
DAS28-ESR change from baseline at Week 24 with no imputation of data (i.e., discounted patients with 
a missing week 24 DAS28-ESR value) for the ITT Analysis Set is presented in Table 26.

Table 26 DAS28-ESR-Change from baseline at week 24- No imputation (ITT analysis set) 
Tipping Point Analysis 
To assess the robustness of the missing at random assumption for the primary estimand, a tipping 
point analysis was also performed, based on the same analysis of covariance model as for the primary 
analysis. Missing data were imputed by means of the multiple imputation approach of the primary 
estimand, with imputed values adjusted with a sequence of shift values for DAS28-ESR change from 
baseline at Week 24 of between -3 and 3, separately by treatment. 
Tipping points were identified in both the analysis for the FDA and the analysis for the EMA. In the 
analysis for the EMA, no tipping points were identified. The applicant states that the tipping point 
identified for the FDA analysis was the most extreme case possible and seems implausible considering 
the results of Estimand 1.2 which addressed the worst case scenario of returning to baseline.  
Subgroup analyses 
By previous Exposure to Biologic Treatment and by COVID19 Vaccination Status 
Subgroup analysis by Previous Exposure to Biologic Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis i.e., change of 
baseline DAS28-ESR at Week 24 in the ITT Analysis Set is presented in  
Figure 9 DAS-ESR Change from Baseline at Week 24, Subgroup Analysis. The subgroup with previous 
exposure to biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis consisted of 29 patients in MSB11456 and 26 
patients in EU-Roactemra group respectively. 
Stratified analysis by COVID19 Vaccination status is also shown in Figure 9. The COVID 19 vaccinated 
consisted of 35 patients in the MSB11456 group and 30 patients in the EU-RoActemra group. 
For the above subgroup analyses, similar results were observed in the PP Analysis Set as in the ITT 
Analysis Set.

By Antidrug Antibody (ADA) Status and by Neutralising Antibody (NAb) Status 
DAS28-ESR change from baseline at Week 24 was to be summarised by ADA status and by NAb in the 
ITT Analysis Set and PP Analysis Set. The applicant states that these analyses were not done because 
the ADA-negative subgroup category and the NAb-positive group included fewer than 10% of patients 
in the respective analysis population the planned analyses. See Table 27 for the ADA overall status 
results. As presented below, the proportions of ADA incidence at week 24 was 76.3% (209/274) in the 
MSB11456 group and 68.6% (194/283) in the EU-RoActemra group.

DAS28-ESR Mean Change from Baseline at All Assessment Visits up to Week 30  
DAS28-ESR mean absolute change from baseline was determined at all assessment visits except Week 
1 (i.e., at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 30). The LS mean decrease in DAS28-ESR from baseline and 
at all assessment visits (except week 1) are presented in Figure 10. Overall, the LS mean decreases 
from baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 24 were observed from the entire throughout all visits and 
sustained to Week 30 in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups. The DAS28-ESR mean changes 
from baseline at Week 30 were similar in both the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups, as indicated 
by the 95% CIs for the difference in change from baseline between groups.

Key Secondary Estimand (ACR20 Response Rate at Week 24) 
Key Secondary Estimand 2.0 (ACR20 ITT) 
ACR20 response at Week 24 in the ITT Analysis Set (Key Secondary Estimand 2.0) using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) is summarised in Table 28. In brief the proportion of patients 
reaching ACR20 response at week 24 was 80.75% in the MSB11456 group and 84.77 % in the EU-
RoActemra group. The difference (%) in response rate was -3.94 (95%CI -9.97 to 2.11).

Subgroup analyses of ACR20 response rate at week 24      
Subgroup analyses of the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 were performed by previous exposure to 
biologic treatment for RA and by previous COVID-19 vaccination status. According to the applicant, 
largely similar results were observed for the PP Analysis Set as for the ITT Analysis Set. The difference 
(%) in response rate was quite high especially among those with prior biological therapy i.e., -5.72 (-
27.03 to 16.58) and among those that had received COVID19 vaccination i.e., -7.25 (-24.16 to 10.65) 
Of note the analyses were hampered by low precision. 
Ancillary analyses 
Supportive Estimand 3.0: Early DAS28-ESR Change from Baseline at Week 12 and remaining 
explorative analysis  
The result of the analysis of the supportive Estimand 3.0 (i.e., the same attributes as Primary 
Estimand 1.0, except that Week 24 was replaced by Week 12 in all relevant attributes’ description to 
investigate early treatment effects) was overall similar as that of the primary estimand. The results of 
the statistical analyses of supportive estimands 3.1 (early DAS28-ESR, PP) and supportive estimands 
3.2 (early DAS28-ESR hypothetical continuing as PP, ITT) as well as a sensitivity analysis of supportive 
Estimand 3.0 with no imputation were overall similar to those of the supportive Estimand 3.0 in the ITT 
Analysis Set. 
Likewise, didn’t the results of the remaining explorative analyses show any substantially different 
results as compared to the main analyses.   
Efficacy after week 24 
The comparisons of efficacy between the MSB11456 and RMP groups after week 24 were based on the 
data for the Overall Period (from Week 1 up to Week 52). The exploration of the effects of a single-
treatment transition in the RMP to MSB11456 group compared with the MSB11456 group and 
compared with the RMP group, is based on the data for the Extended Period (from Week 24/extended 
baseline up to Week 52). DAS28-ESR repeated measures analyses for change from baseline (i.e., 
primary endpoint) are summarised for the Overall Period in Table 29 (ITT Analysis Set). The results 
were overall in line with the 24-weeks results. A substantially similar result was observed also for the 
secondary endpoint/estimands.

Title: A Randomized, Double-blind, Multiple-dose, Parallel-group, Two-arm Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of MSB11456 Compared to European Union‒approved RoActemra® 
in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (APTURA I Study)  
Study identifier 
 Protocol number: FKS456-001,  
 EudraCT number: 2019-004369-42 
Design 
This was a multicentre, randomised (1:1), active-controlled, double-blind, 
multiple fixed-dose, multinational, two-arm, parallel-group study to compare 
the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the proposed biosimilar candidate 
MSB11456 versus EU-approved RoActemra in patients with moderately to 
severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Randomisation was stratified by previous 
exposure to biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (yes/no).  
At the end of Week 24 Visit, after all planned assessments had been conducted 
and the investigator had confirmed that the study drug did not need to be 
discontinued (Refer to Module 5.3.5.1 FKS456-001 CSR Appendix 16.1.1 - 
Protocol Section 6.3 for criteria for patient withdrawal), patients were re-
randomised. Patients initially randomised to the MSB11456 group were re-
assigned to the same treatment with a probability of 1. Patients initially 
randomised to the EU-approved RoActemra group were randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either MSB11456 or EU-approved RoActemra. This 
extension Phase included a 28-weeks period of double-blind treatment, 
followed by 12 weeks of safety follow-up. 
Duration of main phase: 
24 weeks (also referred as Core Treatment 
Period) 
Duration of Run-in phase:  
4 weeks (also referred as Screening Period) 
Duration of Extension phase: 
40 weeks, including

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study FKS456-001 was a randomised, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-group clinical study 
conducted in patients with moderately to severely active RA who have experienced an inadequate 
clinical response to at least one DMARD (either synthetic or biologic) and are currently receiving a 
stable dose of methotrexate. The overall aim is to evaluate efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity 
similarity of MSB11456 to EU-RoActemra administered as a weekly injection of 162 mg 
subcutaneously.  
The study consists of a Screening period, a double-blind 24-week Core Treatment Period followed by 
an additional 28-week double-blind Extended Treatment Period and a 12-week Safety Evaluation 
Period. This original submission covered efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and PK results up to Week 
30, thus covering the 24-week Core Treatment Period and the first 6 weeks of the Extended Treatment 
Period. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant submitted a new CSR including efficacy data up to Week 
52 and additional safety data including immunogenicity up until Week 63, see safety section for more 
details.  
The choice of the indication (rheumatoid arthritis), the clinical setting (patients not adequately 
controlled with methotrexate or previous biological treatment), the primary and key secondary 
endpoints (DAS28-ESR and ACR20 at week 24) and the equivalence margin (± 15%) are in line with 
the CHMP guidance and were endorsed in CHMP Scientific Advice. The pre-specified equivalence 
margins of the primary efficacy estimand (DAS28-ESR at Week 24) set to [-0.6, 0.6] is also endorsed. 
Thus, the clinical model is considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the detection of differences 
between the two products.  
The study objectives and the participants are overall acceptable. It should be noted that all patients 
were treated with concomitant methotrexate. This has potential impact on the extrapolation to 
indications where tocilizumab is intended for monotherapy, since concomitant methotrexate is 
expected to decrease the risk for immunogenicity. The time period for enrolment into the study and 
the included study sites and setting are also acknowledged. There is no concern about the 
amendments to the study protocol. The methods used for randomisation (including randomisation by 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 93/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous biologic treatment) and blinding are likewise acceptable. Patients who previously received 1 
or 2 biologic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis were capped at 10% of the total study population. 
Statistical methods 
Scientific advice regarding the estimands, handling of missing data and analyses was given by the 
CHMP on 24 June 2021 (EMA/SA/0000060099). The advices given were mainly followed. Although the 
primary 24-week endpoint was accepted by CHMP, the importance of an earlier, potentially more 
sensitive, time point to confirm consistency across the study regarding the conclusion on biosimilarity 
was raised by the CHMP. An early efficacy estimand at week 12 has been defined to meet this 
requirement. This is endorsed. 
The spectrum of analysis approaches described for DAS28 (one primary and three 
supportive/supplementary estimands, including sensitivity analyses) is seen to cover a sufficiently 
broad range of assumptions, allowing for assessment of robustness of conclusion drawn. The more 
conventional ITT and PP population analyses were performed as well as an approach to define a ‘PP-
like’ estimand based on the full analyses set, which is endorsed. 
For the key secondary endpoint (ACR20) the CHMP advised to use multiple imputation (MI) methods 
rather than single imputation methods. This advice was not followed in the primary analyses since 
LOCF, and non-responder imputations was used. MI is however introduced in sensitivity analyses which 
is endorsed. The different analyses provided is considered to cover a sufficiently broad range of 
assumptions also for this endpoint.  
No multiple test procedure for secondary endpoints were planned or used in the study, making only the 
primary analysis formally type I error protected. 
Results 
Participants flow, protocol deviations  
Of the 908 patients with RA screened, a total of 604 (302 in each treatment group) were randomised. 
All of these received study drug administered SC according to the randomised treatment and were 
included in the Safety Analysis Set.  
The proportions of patients discontinuing study drug prior to Week 24 were 35 (11.6%) and 26 (8.6%) 
in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups respectively. The major reasons were, according to the 
applicant, AEs and consent withdrawal. Although the differences by treatment group were quite small, 
the reasons behind consent withdrawal were not entirely clear in the first submission. The applicant 
has in the second round presented the reasons for withdrawal. It is overall agreed that treatment 
discontinuation rate was relatively low and quite balanced across arms in the Core Period and the 
numerical differences between treatment groups observed were probably not related to differences 
between the treatment groups but instead considered a chance observation. Further, the high 
occurrence of major protocol deviations (PDs) in the ITT analysis set during the Core Treatment Period 
in both treatment groups has been clarified by the applicant displaying that the reasons for the high 
proportion of PDs were due to a very conservative definition of major protocol deviations. This included 
for example that both COVID-19 treatments and vaccinations were included as a prohibited medicine 
and thereby resulted in a PD. In the light of this very strict definition of PDs it is overall agreed with 
the applicant that the recorded major PDs did not impact data validity and integrity of the study.  
Baseline characteristics  
Demographic characteristics and baseline disease characteristics were overall balanced across 
treatment groups in the ITT Analysis Set. The two treatment groups were also largely balanced with 
respect to medical history and prior medication. Most of the included patients had high disease activity 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 94/126 
 
 
 
 
at baseline according to multiple measures of disease activity. Disease activity were however equally 
distributed between the treatment groups. Of note, the proportion of patients with positive anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) were lower (6.6 versus 8.3%) as was also the ADA titres (108 versus 252) in the 
MSB11456 versus the EU-RoActemra group.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the primary endpoint/primary estimand i.e., the absolute mean change of DAS28-ESR at 24 weeks 
was -3.53 (95% CI -3.74 to -3.32) for MSB11456 and -3.34 (95% CI -3.75 to -3.35) for EU-
RoActemra. This corresponded to a LS mean difference of 0.01 (standard error 0.104) with a 95% CI 
of -0.19 to 0.22. The mean change of DAS28-ESR in both treatment groups is considered high and 
clinically relevant. The results support therapeutic equivalence of MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra with 
the 95% CIs for the LS mean differences in change from baseline between groups fully included within 
the respective predefined equivalence intervals. The results of the statistical analyses of supportive 
Estimand 1.1 (PP approach) and Supportive Estimand 1.2 and 1.3 (DAS28-ESR Hypothetical Return-to-
Baseline PP and ITT respectively) were also supportive of therapeutic equivalence between the 
treatment arms. Likewise, the sensitivity (no imputation and tipping point) analyses supported the 
original findings in the analysis of the primary estimand. In subgroup analyses, i.e., stratifying for the 
previous exposure to biologic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and for COVID19 vaccination status 
also showed largely similar results as the main analysis although with limited statistical precision.  
In addition, the results from the explorative analyses of DAS28-ESR mean absolute change from 
baseline at all assessment visits except Week 1 (i.e., at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 30) also 
indicated similar efficacy in both treatment groups. The submitted results support the comparable 
efficacy between MSB11456 and RoActemra. 
Of note, the number of missing values of the primary endpoint i.e., DAS28-ESR at week 24 is rather 
high (25 versus 17 in the MSB11456 and the EU-RoActemra group respectively). According to the 
applicant the main reason for missing on DAS28-ESR at Week 24 data was due to patients 
discontinuing prior to Week 24 and further that the impact of the missing data was minimal as the 
sensitivity analyses were in line with and support the primary analysis. This is acceptable.  
The applicant states that prespecified subgroup analyses by ADA status and by NAb status were not 
performed because the ADA-negative subgroup category and the NAb positive subgroup respectively 
included fewer than 10% of the patients. Although this is overall agreed when looking at the entire 
study period, the proportions of ADA incidence at week 24 was 76.3% (209/274) in the MSB11456 
group and 68.6% (194/283) in the EU-RoActemra group, see below for further reasoning on this.   
The proportion of patients reaching the key secondary estimand (ACR20 response at week 24) was 
80.75% in the MSB11456 group and 84.77 % in the EU-RoActemra group. The difference (%) in 
response rate was thus -3.94 (95% CI -9.97 to 2.11). Thus, the 95% confidence interval falls within 
the pre-defined equivalence margin of +/-15%.  
The result of the analyses of the supportive estimands 2.1 and 2.2 as well as the sensitivity analyses 
were also overall similar to the main analysis of the key secondary estimand. This was also the case for 
the subgroup analyses. Again, the difference (%) in response rate was high especially among those 
with prior biological therapy, 5.72 (-27.03 to 16.58) and among those that had received COVID19 
vaccination, -7.25 (-24.16 to 10.65). However, the interpretation of these subgroup analyses was 
hampered by small sample size.  
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant presented data on efficacy after week 24 based on the results for 
the Overall Period (from Week 1 up to Week 52). The results were overall in line with the 24-weeks 
results. A substantially similar result was observed also for the secondary endpoint/estimands. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 95/126 
 
 
 
 
Given the importance of ADA/ immunogenicity for the assessment, the applicant was asked to provide 
descriptive data regarding the primary and key secondary endpoints in the two treatment groups by 
ADA and NAb status. Taken together this data (provided in the second round) show a substantially 
similar response with respect to the primary and secondary endpoints by ADA and by Nab in the EU-
RoActemra group and the MSB11456 group respectively. This was true both for the core period (24-
week), the overall period and when presenting data on primary and secondary endpoints by each visit. 
Of note the proportions of ADA negative and Nab positive patients respectively are very few, making 
robust conclusions difficult to draw. 
For further discussion on the impact of ADA on drug levels and efficacy, please refer to section2.6.8. 
(Clinical safety).  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study FKS456-001 including 604 subjects with RA randomised 1:1 to either MSB11456 or 
EU-RoActemra comprised a double-blind 24-week Core Treatment Period followed by an additional 28-
week double-blind Extended Treatment Period and a 12-week Safety Evaluation Period. Efficacy data 
up until week 52 was submitted with this application and showed evidence of therapeutic equivalence 
between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra in this sensitive clinical model of RA, and therefore, supports 
biosimilarity with respect to efficacy.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety data supporting a similar clinical profile of MSB11456 relative to the reference  
product (Ro)Actemra for the SC route of administration is drawn primarily from 2 clinical studies:  
1) the comparative pivotal pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) Study MS200740-0001  
that randomised 695 healthy subjects and 2) the comparative pivotal safety and  efficacy  
Study FKS456-001 that randomised 604 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (see Table 31). Further  
safety information of MSB11456 is provided by Study FKS456-003 comparing the administration  
of MSB11456 by PFS and AI in 100 healthy volunteers. 
Evidence for a similar profile in terms of product safety when administered IV is primarily  
provided by Study FKS456-002.  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
During the clinical development of MSB11456, a total of 834 subjects received at least one dose 
of MSB11456. Of those, the study drug was administered by SC injection in 772 subjects including 
139 patients who have been switched from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456, and by IV infusion in 
62 subjects (Table 31).

Table 31. Number of subjects receiving at least one dose of study drug 
In the pivotal study FKS456-001, a total of 441 randomised patients with rheumatoid arthritis were 
exposed to at least 1 injection of MSB11456. Overall, from Day 1 to Week 52 the mean exposure was 
45.34 (±14.560) weeks in the MSB11456 group, 44.30 (±15.424) weeks in the EU-RoActemra group 
and 49.48 (±6.962) in the EU-RoActemra-to-MSB11456 group.

Pivotal study FKS456-001 
During the Core Treatment Period of Study FKS456-001, the proportion of subjects with at least  
1 SAE was 9.3% in the MSB11456 group and 9.9% in the EU-RoActemra group (Table 36). The most 
common SAE in both treatment groups were infections.  
A total of 5 deaths were reported up to Week 63: 
•  1 death in an unrandomised patient during the Screening Period 
•  3 deaths during the Overall Period up to Week 55 (COVID-19, acute myocardial infarction, 
COVID-19 pneumonia, all in the EU-RoActemra group),  
•  1 death between Week 55 and Week 63 of the Overall Period (myocardial infarction in the 
MSB11456 to EU-RoActemra group). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
The bioanalytical methods and ADA results are described in section 3.3.1 Clinical pharmacology. 
The immunogenicity of MSB11456 was evaluated directly in comparison to the originator product, in the 
three  randomised,  double-blind  parallel  group,  clinical  studies  as  described  previously.  In    total,    the  
ADA    Evaluable    population    comprised    1417    subjects    across    the    three    clinical  studies.  A  highly 
sensitive  (limit  of  detection  approximately  4  ng  positive  control  antibody/mL)  and  drug-tolerant  anti-
drug  antibody  (ADA)  assay  was  applied  in  conjunction  with  a  cell-based  neutralising  antibody  (NAb) 
assay to monitor the humoral immune response to tocilizumab. 
Study MS200740-0001 
In Study MS200740-0001, the detected ADA incidence was similar for healthy volunteers receiving a 
single 162 mg SC dose of MSB11456 (67.1%) or EU-RoActemra  (65.8%), and slightly lower  in 
subjects receiving US-Actemra  (53.7%). The incidence of NAb against tocilizumab was 2.6% in the 
MSB11456 treatment arm, 1.3% in the US-Actemra treatment arm, and 2.7% in the EU-RoActemra 
treatment arm.

Study FKS456-002 
The ADA incidence for healthy volunteers receiving a single IV infusion dose of 8 mg/kg of MSB11456 
or US-Actemra was 91.9% and 98.5 % respectively.  
Study FKS456-001 
A high incidence of ADA positive results was detected in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 
MSB11456 (97% of total ADA positive patients for Week 0 to Week 30) and EU-RoActemra (95.7%) 
and 97.1% for patients who switched from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 at Week 24. ADA incidence 
appeared to peak at Week 2 all both treatment groups (Table 39 and Figure 12).

Impact of ADA on safety 
The following were considered predefined adverse events of special interest (AESI) potentially  
related to immunogenicity for this study: 
•  Serious infections (defined as those requiring administration of intravenous antibiotics) 
•  Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
•  Adverse events leading to the interruption of study treatment, permanent discontinuation  
of study treatment or withdrawal from the study. 
The incidence of any AESI potentially related to immunogenicity for the ADA positive subpopulations in 
each treatment group (Overall Period) was 37.6% for MSB11456, 34.5% for EU-RoActemra and 35.8% 
for patients who switched treatment from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 at Week 24 (Table 41). 
Table 41. Treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest by ADA status – overall period  
(Safety Analysis Set) 
The incidence of hypersensitivity events for the ADA positive subpopulations in each treatment 
group (Overall Period of 52 weeks) was 5.4% for MSB11456, 8.2% for EU-RoActemra and 10.8% 
for patients who switched treatment at Week 24 from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456. 
There were no anaphylactic reactions reported. 
There was a higher incidence of injection site reactions for the ADA positive sub-population in the 
MSB11456 treatment group (12.2%) compared to the EU-RoActemra group (8.2%). It should be noted 
that almost all patients in both arms were ADA-positive (98.7% vs 98.1%, respectively for MSB11456 
and RoActemra).

Please refer to Table 36. In the pivotal study up to week 24, TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation was reported in 32/302 patients (10.6%) in the MSB11456 group and in 22/302 
patients (7.3%) in the EU-RoActemra group.  
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
MSB11456 is currently not marketed in any country. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
MSB11456 is proposed as a biosimilar to RoActemra in both approved formulations (IV and SC). The 
most common adverse reactions noted in clinical studies with RoActemra were upper respiratory tract 
infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
injection site reactions (ISRs) after SC administration. 
In terms of immunogenicity, the detected incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) was relatively low 
(less than 2%) in the different approved indications when RoActemra was administered as a 
monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate in historical studies. 
The main data supporting biosimilarity from a clinical perspective originates from the comparative 
pivotal safety and efficacy Study FKS456-001 including 604 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis 
randomised to either SC MSB11456 or SC EU-RoActemra in prefilled syringe. Study FKS456-001 
consists of a screening period, a double-blind 24-week core treatment period followed by an additional 
28-week double-blind extended treatment period and a 12-week safety evaluation period. The original 
submission covered efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and PK results up to week 30 covering both the 
24-week core treatment period and the first 6 weeks of the extended treatment period. In response to 
day 120 LoQ, the applicant submitted a new CSR including data up to Week 63, including 
immunogenicity data up to the latest timepoint for ADA analysis (week 55).  
Supportive data are received from:  
•  SC PK/PD study MS200740-0001 comparing the PK,  safety, and immunogenicity of  
MSB11456 with US-Actemra and EU-RoActemra in healthy subjects, who received a single dose 
of 162 mg of the assigned study medication 
• 
IV PK study FKS456-002 comparing the PK, safety, and immunogenicity of IV administered 
MSB11456 with that of IV administered US-Actemra in healthy subjects, who received a single 
dose of 8 mg/kg of the assigned study medication 
• 
Prefilled syringe vs autoinjector study FKS456-003 comparing the PK and safety of MSB11456 
administered via PFS and AI in healthy subjects, who received SC a single dose of 162 mg 
MSB11456 via PFS and AI each, in the assigned treatment sequence (ie, PFS followed by AI or 
AI followed by PFS). 
If not otherwise stated, the data presented in the safety section comes from the pivotal efficacy and 
safety study FKS456-001. 
Exposure 
During the clinical development of MSB11456, a total of 834 subjects received at least one dose 
of MSB11456. Of those, the study drug was administered by SC injection in 772 subjects including 
Assessment report

139 patients who have been switched from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456, and by IV infusion in 
62 subjects. 
Overview of adverse events 
In PK study MS200740-0001, the pattern of AEs was similar in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra 
groups, respectively. Serious AEs was more frequent in the MSB11456 group. Overall, five  (5)  
subjects  reported  SAEs:  3 subjects  in  the  MSB11456  group  (appendicitis  perforated  Grade  3,  
considered  related  to  study treatment; pneumothorax spontaneous Grade 3, considered unrelated to 
study treatment; abortion spontaneous Grade 1, considered related to study treatment), 1 subject in 
the US-Actemra group (abdominal  pain  Grade  3,  considered  related  to  study  treatment)  and  1  
subject  in  the  EU-RoActemra  group  (appendicitis  perforated  Grade  3,  considered  related  to  
study  treatment). Although this imbalance evokes some concern, it is likely a random finding given 
the few overall events. The most frequently observed TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache, oropharyngeal pain, vessel puncture site bruise and nausea. Injection site reactions were 
slightly more frequent in the MSB11456 group (18/231 patients, 7.8%) than in the EU-RoActemra 
group (12/225 patients, 5.3%). Injection site erythema and injection site bruising were reported in all 
treatment arms (5.3% for EU RoActemra and 6.5 % for MSB11456, 2.7% for EU RoActemra and 6.9% 
for MSB11456 respectively). However, less injection site reactions have been observed for US licensed 
Actemra. The apparent imbalance in injection site reactions has been attributed to injection site 
technique by the applicant and findings were considered of no clinical relevance as all these injection 
site reactions were mild, short duration and resolved spontaneously.  
The injection site reactions observed in study MS200740-0001 must be interpreted together with the 
data from the pivotal study, see later in this report.  
IV PK study FKS456-002 did not include any comparison against EU-RoActemra and the study is 
therefore of limited relevance for this assessment. 
In prefilled syringe vs autoinjector study FKS456-003, it is agreed that no specific differences in safety 
outcomes were observed between the autoinjector and the prefilled syringe, apart from a higher 
occurrence of injection site reactions for the autoinjector. According to the applicant, the slightly higher 
frequency of ISRs observed for the AI may be due to more direct contact of the AI with the skin 
compared to the PFS (the AI is pushed to the skin during administration). This seems reasonable. 
In the pivotal study FKS456-001 up to week 24, the frequency of TEAEs was similar in the MSB11456 
(65.2%) and EU-RoActemra (62.3%) groups, respectively. Also, SAE were equally frequent in both 
arms. AESI was slightly more frequent in the MSB11456 group, se details later in this AR, as were 
TEAEs leading to treatment and study discontinuation. There were four deaths reported during the 
overall study, 3 in the EU-RoActemra arm (COVID-19, acute myocardial infarction, COVID-19 
pneumonia) and 1 in the MSB11456 to EU-RoActemra arm (myocardial infarction). 
Common adverse events 
The frequencies of common adverse events were very similar between the arms. Headache was slightly 
more frequent in the MSB11456 arm (5%) than in the EU-RoActemra arm (2%), however this pattern 
was not consistent across the other studies (for example in study MS200740-0001 headache was more 
frequent in the EU-RoActemra arm).   
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Although serious 
infections and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were numerically higher in the 
biosimilar arm, this might be a random finding given the few events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 110/126 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events of special interest 
Overall, AESIs were numerically more frequent in the biosimilar arm. These include for example 
infections (12.6 vs 9.6%) and leukopenia (1.7 vs 1.0%). However, the difference between the arms is 
considered too small to draw any conclusions on clinically meaningful differences. No particular 
differences in the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions were observed between the arms. 
As previously noted in PK study MS200740-0001, injection site reactions were more frequent in the 
MSB11456 arm (34/302, 11.3%) than in the EU-RoActemra arm (14/302 patients, 4.6%). The main 
difference is observed for erythema, pain and pruritus. At day 120, the applicant was asked to further 
discuss this, including a justification as to why this does not constitute a meaningful difference 
precluding biosimilarity. In their response, the applicant argues that although a difference in 
prevalence of injection site reactions was observed up to week 24 (11.3% and 4.6% in the MSB11456 
and RMP groups, respectively), this difference was smaller in the overall study period (12.3% and 
8.0% of patients in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups, respectively). Very few cases (1 patient 
in the MSB11456 arm and 2 patients in the RoActemra arm) had injection site reactions that resulted 
in discontinuation of the study drug. The applicant considers the observed imbalance in injection site 
reactions to be clinically not relevant. 
The applicant has discussed the potential causes for the observed numerical imbalance in injection site 
reactions rate. Overall, the comparison of structural, physiochemical and functional attributes using 
multiple batches of the proposed biosimilar product and reference product, demonstrate that 
MSB11456 and RoActemra show high similarity in quality attribute. This is agreed on (for details please 
refer to section 2.4.). There are however some possible causes for this observed difference as is 
further discussed below.  
According to the applicant, dimerisation/aggregation reflected by high molecular weight (HMW) content 
might be a potential influencing factor on the occurrence of injection site reactions. However, the HMW 
profile of the MSB11456 clinical batches is stated to be well within the accepted quality range. Further, 
the amount of HMW in MSB11456 batches used in the clinical study FKS456-001 was found to be in 
general slightly lower than the amount of HMW observed for the EU-RMP batches used in Study 
FKS456-001.  
Further, the applicant has discussed possible differences in composition/excipients. According to the 
applicant, all excipients used for the formulation of MSB11456 are well-known and widely used in the 
pharmaceutical industry for solutions for injection. None of the excipients used is expected to induce 
clinically relevant Injection site reactions or would have any other safety impact. 
Finally, the applicant has discussed possible influence of immunogenicity on the injection site reactions 
prevalence. The proportion of ADA-positive patients with an injection site reaction was similar to the 
proportion of ADA-negative patients with an injection site reaction (9.8% and 9.1% of patients, 
respectively). The applicant concludes that due to the high incidence of ADAs it cannot be fully 
excluded that ADA status would have any slight influence on injection site reactions, nevertheless the 
likelihood is very minimal due to consistent results between MSB11456 and RoActemra irrespective of 
ADA status. This is agreed on. 
Overall, given the well-characterised similarity between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra from a quality 
and PK perspective, the observed difference in injection site reactions between the arms might be a 
random finding that does not indicate a true difference between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra. 
Laboratory values

Mean change from baseline to week in Hb, leukocytes, platelets and neutrophils were similar between 
the arms). Further, the frequencies of haematology-related adverse events (anaemia, leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia) were similar in both treatment groups. 
It is agreed with the applicant that no clinically meaningful differences  in  mean  or  median  
biochemistry  values  were  noted  across the treatment groups. No relevant differences were observed 
between the arms in urinalysis parameters. 
No clinically relevant findings with respect to the clinical laboratory evaluation were observed in  
Study FKS456-002 or FKS456-003.  
There were no  clinically  relevant  findings  with  respect  to  vital  signs  and  ECG  recordings. 
Immunogenicity 
ADA levels were generally high in both treatment groups (>95%). This is far higher than what was 
observed in the RoActemra studies SC-II and SC-II, where ADA levels around 1% were observed 
(RoActemra SmPC). According to the applicant, the ADA sensitivity was in line with the current 
standards. The analytical methods are further discussed in the clinical pharmacology section.  
A higher proportion of patients in the EU-RoActemra group was ADA positive at baseline (6.6% in 
MSB11456 group and 8.3% in EU-Roactemra group), whereas a shift is observed at week 12 and 
onwards with a higher proportion of ADA-positive patients in the MSB11456 than in the EU-RoActemra 
group (80.9% vs 61.1% [difference 19.8% in favour of RoActemra] at week 52). The similar 
observation is made with regards to ADA titres, with lower levels at baseline for MSB11456 than for 
EU-RoActemra, but higher levels for MSB11456 than for EU-RoActemra at week 30 and 52.  
Among ADA-positive patients, injection site reactions occurred more frequently in the MSB11456 group 
(12.2%) than in the EU-RoActemra group (8.2%). There was no notable difference between ADA-
positive and ADA-negative patients, however the limited number of ADA-negative patients hampers 
firm conclusions to be drawn. 
Somewhat reassuring, no meaningful difference in ADA levels was observed in the PK studies. In SC PK 
study MS200740-0001, the detected ADA incidence was similar for healthy volunteers receiving a 
single 162 mg SC dose of MSB11456 (67.1%) or EU-RoActemra (65.8%).  In the IV PK study, the ADA 
incidence was 91.9% for MSB11456 and 98.5 % for US-Actemra, respectively. 
A difference is noted in serum drug concentration, which might be a result of an imbalance in ADAs. 
For details, please refer to section2.6.2.. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary estimands were additionally planned by ADA and 
NAb status. However, these analyses were different to interpret since at least 1 subgroup category 
included fewer than 10% of patients in the respective analysis population and results would not have 
been interpretable (please refer to efficacy section). 
To summarise, the observed difference in ADA prevalence between the products observed from week 
12 to week 52 confers some uncertainty regarding a potential difference in immunogenicity between 
the products. However, it is acknowledged that the method for ADA detection is very sensitive and that 
the relative difference between the arms is small. Although a decrease in serum drug concentration is 
observed from week 12 and onwards in the MSB11456 arm compared to the EU-RoActemra arm, there 
are no indications that this would confer an impaired efficacy for the biosimilar. It is further 
acknowledged that the immunogenicity for tocilizumab in previous studies has been shown to be very 
low, and therefore this small potential difference is not expected to pose clinical issue and is likely due 
to a more sensitive method for ADA detection. 
Extrapolation to other indications  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023

According to the applicant, data support a consistent immunogenicity profile of tocilizumab across all 
approved indications, populations, routes and modes of administration, and regardless if the drug was 
used as monotherapy or in combination with csDMARDs. Therefore, the applicant considers it justified 
to anticipate that MSB11456 does exert a similar immunogenicity profile as the reference product in 
those indications and populations approved for (Ro)Actemra which were not studied in the MSB11456 
clinical programme. Further, the applicant states that the safety profile of (Ro)Actemra across all 
approved indications and routes of administration is similar and undifferentiated with the exception of 
injection site reactions which occurred more frequently following the SC route than the IV route  of 
administration. This is agreed on.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
To conclude, some uncertainties regarding the biosimilarity between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra 
were identified during the assessment. The most important difference was a small difference in ADA 
prevalence between MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra.   
However, there are no differences observed from a quality perspective to explain such a potential 
difference between the products (please refer to section 3.1 and 3.3). Taking the totality of data and 
the similarity observed in the quality and PK characterisation of the products into account, the small 
observed difference in immunogenicity does not preclude biosimilarity.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The applicant is seeking approval for both administration routes and all indications for the reference 
medicinal product EU-RoActemra, namely: 
1.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  
2.  Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 1 year (SC route) / 2 years (IV route) of 
age and older 
3.  Juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older  
4.  Giant cell arteritis (GCA) 
5.  Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-induced severe or life-threatening CRS in adults and 
pediatric patients 2 years of age and older  
6.  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalised adults who are receiving systemic 
corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation 
Use of MSB11456 in the treatment of RA, pJIA, and sJIA is proposed for both the IV and SC routes of 
administration, whereas treatment of GCA is through the SC route and treatment of CRS and COVID-
19 disease is through the IV route only. 
According to the applicant, the development of MSB11456 followed the standard stepwise approach for 
establishing similarity across structural and functional quality attributes, and (nonclinical and) clinical 
data consistent with relevant guidance advice were obtained. 
The objective of the clinical development programme for MSB11456 was to evaluate the clinical 
similarity between MSB11456 and the reference product (Ro)Actemra, in terms of clinical 
pharmacology, efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. 
The clinical development programme consisted of three phase 1 studies and one phase 3 study. The 
phase 1 studies included healthy individuals with the objective to evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) 
similarity of intravenous administration of MSB11456 versus US-Actemra (FKS456-002) and for 
subcutaneous administration of MSB11456 versus EU-RoActemra/US-Actemra (MS200740-0001). A 
third study (FK456-003) likewise included healthy participants with the aim to evaluate PK equivalence 
in pre-filled versus auto-injector administration of MSB114556. All phase 1 studies are finalised. The 
pivotal study FKS456-001 was a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, two arm study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity of MSB11456 compared to EU-RoActemra in patients with moderately to 
severely active RA (APTURA I study). The study included 604 patients randomised to either MSB11456 
or EU-RoActemra SC.  
The applicant has reviewed scientific advice and have broadly implemented CHMP scientific advice in 
their programme.

Quality 
The applicant has performed an extensive biosimilarity exercise, evaluating relevant quality attributes 
by a panel of state-of-the-art analytical methods. The overall approach to assess analytical similarity is 
found acceptable.  
The batches included in the biosimilarity study are found acceptable, both with respect to MSB11456 
FP-IV (vial) and FP-SC (PFS), the EU approved RoActemra (RMP) and US approved Actemra (RP). The 
analytical similarity assessment has been performed with a combination of methods assessing the 
primary and higher order structures, post-translational modifications, purity and impurities and product 
variants. In addition, biological activities related to Fab binding, intracellular signalling activity, Fc 
binding and Fc effector function have been evaluated. A comparative forced degradation stability study 
is also presented.  
Overall, the provided data indicates a high degree of similarity between MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-
SC (PFS) and EU approved RoActemra. Some minor differences are noted. The applicant justifies the 
differences and provides arguments related to tocilizumab mode of action, results from biological 
characterisation, information in the literature as well as results obtained in non-clinical and clinical 
studies, implying that these differences are not clinically meaningful. EU-approved RoActemra and US-
licensed Actemra are also considered comparable. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
The applicant has performed an extensive biosimilarity exercise, evaluating relevant quality attributes 
by a panel of state-of-the-art analytical methods. The overall approach to assess analytical similarity is 
found acceptable. 
Overall, the provided data indicates a high degree of similarity between MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-
SC (PFS) and EU approved RoActemra. Some minor differences are noted. The applicant justifies the 
differences and provides arguments related to tocilizumab mode of action, results from biological 
characterisation, information in the literature as well as results obtained in non-clinical and clinical

Pharmacokinetics 
The pivotal data for demonstrating PK similarity with the reference product are obtained from two 
single-dose studies in healthy volunteers: Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose 162 mg SC injection) 
and Study FKS456-002 (single-dose 8 mg/kg IV infusion). 
Study MS200740-0001 (single-dose SC injection): For all primary PK parameters (AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and 
Cmax) and all pairwise treatment comparisons (MSB11456 versus US-Actemra; MSB11456 versus EU-
RoActemra; and US-Actemra versus EU-RoActemra), the 90% CIs for the geometric LS mean ratio 
were contained within the predefined 80.00% to 125.00% similarity margin. Furthermore, the 
comparability was established also for PD parameters sIL-6R and CRP. 
Study FKS456-002 (single-dose IV infusion): The statistical analysis of the biosimilarity of MSB11456 
versus US-Actemra included the primary PK endpoint (AUC0-last) and secondary PK parameters (Cmax 
and AUC0-inf). For AUC0-last the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products 
fell within the conventional biosimilarity acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when comparing 
MSB11456 to US-Actemra. PK similarity was additionally demonstrated for the secondary PK 
parameters AUC0-inf and Cmax. The GMRs (and 90% Cis) were 103.34 (98.53-108.37%) for AUC0-last, 
103.15% (97.86-108.73%) for AUC0-inf and 101.48% (97.23-105.92%) for Cmax.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 119/126 
 
 
 
 
Study FKS456-003 (PFS vs AI): For Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf the 90% confidence interval for the ratio 
of the test and reference products fell within the conventional bioequivalence acceptance range of 
80.00-125.00% when comparing the AI to the PFS. The GMRs (and 90% CIs) were 99.67% (90.95-
109.21%) for Cmax, 102.88% (92.21-114.79%) for AUC0-last, and 100.23% (92.67-108.41%) for AUC0-
inf. 
Thus, PK equivalence was demonstrated between the PFS and AI presentations of MSB11456. Also, the 
secondary PK endpoints were comparable between PFS and AI presentations of MSB11456. 
In the pivotal efficacy and safety study FKS456-001, PK trough concentration samples were collected 
from all study patients at scheduled visits. Similar mean trough concentrations were measured until 
week 12. A small difference in mean trough concentration was observed between the MSB11456 and 
EU-RoActemra arms from week 12 and onwards, and a decreased concentration is observed among 
patients who switch from EU-RoActemra to MSB11456 (at week 24) from week 30 and onwards. 
However, this did not impact the efficacy. 
Efficacy 
For a definition of the estimands, please refer to the statistical section.  
For the primary endpoint/primary estimand 1.0 i.e., the absolute mean change of DAS28-ESR at 24 
week was -3.53 (95% CI -3.74 to -3.32) for MSB11456 and -3.34 (95% CI -3.75 to -3.35) for EU-
RoActemra. This corresponded in a LS mean difference of 0.01 (standard error 0.104) with a 95% CI 
of -0.19 to 0.22. The 95% CIs for the LS mean differences in change from baseline between groups 
fully included within the respective predefined equivalence intervals (-0.6 to 0.6). The mean change of 
DAS28-ESR in both treatment groups is considered high and clinically relevant. The results of the 
analyses of supportive Estimand 1.1 (per protocol approach) and Supportive Estimand 1.2 and 1.3 
(DAS28-ESR Hypothetical Return-to-Baseline PP and ITT respectively) showed overall similar results as 
the main analysis. Likewise, sensitivity and subgroup analyses of the primary outcome/primary 
estimand supported the main results. In addition, the analyses of absolute mean change of DAS28-ESR 
from baseline at all assessment visits except Week 1 (i.e., at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 30) 
showed similar efficacy in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra group. 
The proportion of patients reaching the key secondary endpoint/secondary estimand i.e., ACR20 
response at week 24 was 80.75% in the MSB11456 group and 84.77 % in the EU-RoActemra group, 
corresponding to a difference (%) of -3.94 (95% CI -9.97 to 2.11). Thus, the 95% confidence interval 
fell within the pre-defined equivalence margin of +/-15%. Overall, the results of the supportive 
analyses of the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 (supportive Estimand 2.1 and 2.2) as well as 
sensitivity analyses were largely similar to that of the main analysis. In addition, data submitted in the 
second round evaluating efficacy also after 24 weeks (i.e., from baseline up until 52 weeks) showed 
substantially similar results as the 24-week data.  
Safety 
In the pivotal study FKS456-001 up to week 24, the frequency of TEAEs was similar in the MSB11456 
(65.2%) and EU-RoActemra (62.3%) groups, respectively. Also, SAE were equally frequent in both 
arms (9.3% for MSB11456 vs 9.9% for EU-RoActemra). 
The frequencies of common adverse events were similar between the arms. During the Core Treatment 
Period of Study FKS456-001, the most commonly affected SOCs were investigations/laboratory 
derangements (21.2% subjects in the MSB11456 group and 24.8% in the EU-RoActemra group), 
infections and infestations (18.5% and 17.9% patients, respectively) and blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (13.9% and 12.6% patients, respectively).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
The overall approach to assess analytical similarity is found acceptable. Some minor differences are 
noted. The applicant justifies the differences and provides arguments related to tocilizumab mode of 
action, results from biological characterisation, information in the literature as well as results obtained 
in non-clinical and clinical studies, implying that these differences are not clinically meaningful. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Study FKS456-001: Ctrough is the only PK parameter in the phase 3 study.  A small difference in mean 
trough drug concentration is observed between the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra arms from week 12 
and onwards, and a decreased concentration is also observed among patients who switch from EU-
RoActemra to MSB11456 (at week 24) from week 30 and onwards. This raises some concern on a 
potential impact on the long-term efficacy of the biosimilar. However, no difference in efficacy between 
the products could be observed in the 52-week clinical study. 
Efficacy  
From an efficacy perspective the overall data indicate similar clinical efficacy in MSB11456 as 
compared to EU-RoActemra.  
Safety 
Injection site reactions occurred with a higher frequency in the MSB11456 arm than in the EU-
RoActemra arm. In PK study MS200740-0001, injection site reactions were slightly more frequent in 
the MSB11456 group (18/231 patients, 7.8%) than in the EU-RoActemra group (12/225 patients, 
5.3%). The same tendency was observed in the pivotal study FKS456-001, where injection site 
reactions were more frequent in the MSB11456 arm (34/302, 11.3%) than in the EU-RoActemra arm 
(14/302 patients, 4.6%) during the core 24-week period of the study. However, in the Overall Period 
(up to week 63), the difference was smaller with a proportion of patients with at least 1 injection site 
reaction of 12.3% and 8.0% of patients in the MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra groups, respectively.  
Immunogenicity 
ADA levels were generally high in both treatment groups (>95%). This is far higher than what was 
observed in the RoActemra studies SC-1I and SC-II, where ADA levels around 1% were observed 
(RoActemra SmPC) indicating that a very sensitive method for ADA detection has been used. 
In the pivotal study FKS456-001, a higher proportion of patients in the EU-RoActemra group was ADA 
positive at baseline (6.6% in MSB11456 group and 8.3% in EU-Roactemra group), whereas a shift is 
observed at week 12 and onwards with a higher proportion of ADA-positive patients in the MSB11456 
than in the EU-RoActemra group (80.9% vs 61.1% [difference 19.8% in favour of RoActemra] at week 
52). Somewhat reassuring, no clinically meaningful increased ADA prevalence for the biosimilar was 
observed in the PK studies. In SC PK study MS200740-0001, the detected ADA incidence was similar 
for healthy volunteers receiving a single 162 mg SC dose of MSB11456 (67.1%) or EU-RoActemra 
(65.8%). In the IV PK study, the ADA incidence was 91.9% for MSB11456 and 98.5 % for US-
Actemra, respectively. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
From a quality perspective, an extensive biosimilarity exercise has been performed, evaluating relevant 
quality attributes by a panel of state-of-the-art analytical methods. The overall approach to assess 
analytical similarity is found acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 121/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the provided data indicates a high degree of similarity between MSB11456 FP-IV (vial) and FP-
SC (PFS) and EU approved RoActemra. Some minor differences are noted. The applicant justifies the 
differences and provides arguments related to tocilizumab mode of action, results from biological 
characterisation, information in the literature as well as results obtained in non-clinical and clinical 
studies, implying that these differences are not clinically meaningful. EU-approved RoActemra and US-
licensed Actemra are also considered comparable. 
From a pharmacokinetic perspective, the available PK/PD data overall support biosimilarity versus the 
EU reference product RoActemra. 
From an efficacy perspective the results overall show evidence of therapeutic equivalence between 
MSB11456 and EU-RoActemra in this sensitive clinical model of rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore, 
supports biosimilarity.  
From a safety perspective, a small difference in ADA prevalence was observed between MSB11456 and 
EU-RoActemra. There are no indications that this would impair the efficacy of the biosimilar. There are 
no differences observed from a quality perspective to explain such a potential difference in 
immunogenicity. Taking the totality of data and the similarity observed in the quality and PK 
characterisation of the products into account, the products are considered biosimilar.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Inflammatory diseases for which RoActemra is approved are associated with enhanced IL-6 production. 
Tocilizumab binds to soluble and membrane bound IL-6 receptors, blocking IL-6 from exerting its pro-
inflammatory effects. Extrapolation to all indications of RoActemra is considered possible. 
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Tyenne is considered biosimilar to Roactemra. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tyenne is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Tyenne 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion 
“Tyenne, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: 
• 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not 
previously treated with MTX. 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded 
inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. 
In these patients, Tyenne can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where 
continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/365561/2023  
Page 122/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tocilizumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray 
and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Tyenne is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who are 
receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. 
Tyenne is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 
2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs and 
systemic corticosteroids. Tyenne can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX or where

SmPC, Annex 
The review of Proquad post-marketing data has 
update the safety information and further 
characterize the risk of secondary transmission 
following MAH evaluation of new significant 
Pharmacovigilance data. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
The RMP has been updated to version 7.1 to reflect 
those changes and with the consequential revisions: 
the important potential risk of “potential secondary 
transmission of Oka/Merck varicella vaccine virus 
II, Labelling 
demonstrated that transmission of varicella vaccine virus 
and PL 
(Oka/Merck strain) resulting in varicella infection including 
disseminated disease may rarely occur between vaccine 
recipients (who develop or do not develop a varicella-like 
rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella,  including 
healthy as well as high risk individuals.  
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

strain in susceptible high-risk individuals leading to 
severe clinical consequences” is renamed to 
“secondary transmission of Oka/Merck varicella 
vaccine virus strain in susceptible individuals leading 
to disseminated disease” and is reclassified to 
important identified risk. 
The MAH takes the opportunity to implement some 
changes in Section 6.5 of the SmPC with information 
on the glass type for the immediate container 
following the "Excipients in the labelling and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use 
guideline" and the "Guideline on quality aspects 
included in the product information for vaccines for 
human use”. Annex A has been updated with the 
same information. 
In addition, the MAH implements QRD v10.1 taking 
into account the ‘Compilation of QRD decisions on 
stylistic matters in product information’ 
(EMA/25090/2002 rev.19.  
The MAH also takes the chance to align some 
wordings across other MMRV vaccines owned by the 
MAH, in particular section 6.6 ‘Special precautions for 
disposal and other handling’.

vaccine virus strain, exposure of 
immunocompromised individuals, hypersensitivity 
including anaphylaxis and injection-site reactions are 
also removed.  
- Additionally, secondary transmission of Oka/Merck 
vaccine virus strain in susceptible high-risk 
individuals leading to severe clinical consequences is 
included.  
 - The important missing information ‘categories 
exposure during pregnancy’ and ‘safety and

immunocompromised individual was identified during 
routine safety surveillance for varicella virus vaccine, live 
(Oka/Merck). Specimens from the patient’s eye were 
positive for DNA from the Oka strain of varicella-zoster 
virus (VZV). Live varicella vaccines are contraindicated in 
immunocompromised individuals, and the addition of 
necrotizing retinitis to the Product Information is intended 
to inform healthcare professionals (HCPs) that this 
condition has been reported in immunocompromised 
individuals following vaccination. This addition is relevant 
for ProQuad since varicella virus vaccine, live (Oka/Merck) 
is one of the vaccine components in ProQuad. This addition 
also aims at informing HCPs that the eye may be the only 
involved organ at the time of presentation.

from two long-term follow-up studies with Varivax 
(monovalent varicella vaccine) evaluating long-term 
persistence of protective post vaccination antibodies to 
varicella with special regard to an epidemiologically 
changing environment and the rate of breakthrough cases. 
Study 036 was a 15-year observational prospective cohort 
study, which studied long-term antibody persistence of 
varicella vaccine among children and adolescents and 
evaluated the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in vaccinated 
individuals in a 15-year long-term follow-up. 
Study 037 was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey to 
evaluate the changing epidemiology of varicella among 
children and adolescents.  
Both studies showed no increase in the frequency of herpes 
zoster compared to children with prior wild type varicella 
during the pre vaccine era and that varicella vaccinated 
children actually may have a lower risk of herpes zoster. 
Page 30/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The data confirmed that widespread varicella vaccination 
reduces the risk of varicella by approximately 90% and that 
protection is maintained over at least 15 years both in 
vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The Product 
information was updated with more detailed results from 
these studies.

Infanrix hexa no clinically relevant interference in the 
antibody response to each of the individual antigens is 
observed. Generally higher response rates and antibody 
titres were obtained, when both vaccines were given 
concomitantly compared to the administration of each 
vaccine alone. The immunisation schedule (3+1 vs 2+1) 
had limited impact on the immunogenicity results. 
As to be expected after concomitant administration a 
higher percentage of adverse reactions were observed than 
after administration of each vaccine alone. More subjects 
reported at least one solicited injection-site adverse 
reaction related to ProQuad in the concomitant group 
compared to the non-concomitant group, whereas a 
numerically comparable number of subjects reported 
systemic adverse events related to ProQuad in both groups.  
The frequency of adverse reactions in the concomitant 
group is comparable with that of the combined frequency of 
adverse reactions found after administration of both 
vaccines alone.  Only non-injection site varicella-like rashes 
Page 32/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were reported more frequently in the concomitant group 
compared to the ProQuad alone. The safety profile following 
concomitant administration is comparable in terms of 
incidence and nature of adverse events to that following 
separate administration of the vaccines. All observed 
adverse events are already known and described in the 
SmPCs. However higher rates of high fever were observed 
in recipients of ProQuad given concomitantly with Infanrix 
hexa compared to Infanrix hexa alone.  
The Product information was therefore updated with this 
findings and to reflect that ProQuad can be given 
concomitantly with either Prevenar and/or Hepatitis A 
vaccine, or with monovalent or combination vaccines 
comprised of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, or 
hepatitis B antigen.

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of ProQuad remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
Very limited post authorisation safety data are available 
regarding the use of ProQuad (refrigerated formulation) 
within the EU. Furthermore, most of the clinical trials were 
conducted with the frozen vaccine formulation in the US. 
Additionally, a potential increased risk of febrile seizures 
observed in the 5- to 12-day timeframe after the first dose 
of quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella 
vaccines in children compared to concomitant 
administration of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella 
vaccines might be a signal that also other side effects 
might occur more frequently after administering ProQuad 
compared to concomitant administration of measles, 
mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines. 
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
6-monthly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of ProQuad, which 
requires the submission of 6-monthly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

EUSPC regarding ProQuad and thrombocytopenia due to a 
cluster of cases observed in Italy. During the assessment, it 
became apparent that although many of the cases reported 
worldwide (in total 20 cases) had confounding factors that 
could explain the onset of thrombocytopenia, the data 
indicated that individuals with current thrombocytopenia 
may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following 
vaccination with Proquad. The CHMP therefore agreed to 
update the Product Information to reflect this data. In 
addition, a warning has been included that individuals who 
experienced thrombocytopenia following the first dose of a 
live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine may develop 
thrombocytopenia with repeat doses.

ProQuad with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
and/or hepatitis A vaccine. These changes are based 
on a clinical study on the immunogenicity and safety 
of Proquad when given concomitantly with a 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a study on the 
safety of the concomitant administration of Proquad 
and a hepatitis A vaccine and a study evaluating the 
immunogenicity and safety of concomitant

approval for the concomitant administration of ProQuad 
with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and/or hepatitis A 
vaccine. 
The coadministration of ProQuad with the pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine Prevenar showed no impact on the 
antibody responses of both vaccines. Regarding 
concomitant use of ProQuad and VAQTA data on the 
concomitant use of the vaccines MMR II and Varivax (the 
same antigens are contained in ProQuad) with and without 
VAQTA showed that immune responses to measles, mumps 
and rubella 6 weeks after administration to infants at 12 
months of age were similar. In a further study, concomitant 
use of ProQuad, Prevenar and VAQTA revealed also no 
clinically relevant interference of the antibody response 
against each of the individual antigens.  
In terms of safety, ProQuad demonstrated to have an 
acceptable safety profile in children from 12 to 15 months 
of age, when administered together with Prevenar, when 
VAQTA or when all three vaccines were given 
concomitantly. However, an increased rate of vaccine-
related pyrexia could be observed in general when ProQuad 
was coadministered with other vaccines than given alone. 
The use of anti-inflammatory drugs was therefore more 
Page 43/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequent in the group with concomitant vaccine 
administration. Overall, the available data showed a 
sufficient level of efficacy and safety for the 
coadministration of ProQuad when given in combination 
with Prevenar and/or VAQTA.

Based on the review of clinical data, the safety study 
conducted by Merck revealed an increased risk of febrile 
convulsion in children vaccinated with ProQuad compared 
to children receiving MMR and varicella vaccine 
concomitantly. In summary these data suggest that the risk 
of febrile convulsion after vaccination with ProQuad may be 
increased ~2 fold in days 5-12 (when post-vaccination 
fever is most likely to occur), compared to concomitant 
vaccination, but is not different overall in the month 
following vaccination in children vaccinated with ProQuad 
compared to a historical comparison group.

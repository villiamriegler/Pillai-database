1.  Introduction 
On 29th August 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Otezla (Apremilast) 
EMEA/H/C/003746, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Clinical  Study  Report  for  CC-10004-PPSO-003:A  Phase  3,  Multi-Center,  Randomized, 
Double- Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Apremilast (CC-10004) in Pediatric 
Subjects from 6 to less than 18 years of Age with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis is being submitted as a 
stand-alone post-authorisation measure (PAM) with no changes to the Otezla product information proposed at 
this stage. 
The above study forms part of clinical measure of the paediatric investigational plan (PIP) for Otezla for the 
treatment of Psoriasis (PsO) (EMEA- EMEA-000715-PIP03-11-M06). 
Directly upon conclusion of this Article 46 procedure and the paediatric Compliance Check, a Type II variation 
application will be submitted. Dossier preparation for the Type II variation is currently on-going and submission 
is planned for Nov 2023. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In the current study, subjects with baseline weight between 20 to <50 kg received apremilast 20 mg BID or 
placebo BID and subjects with baseline weight ≥50 kg received apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID.Clinical 
aspects. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for one study: 
• 
Clinical Study Report for CC-10004-PPSO-003: 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Study CC-10004-PPSO-003 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast in paediatric subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis. The study included a placebo-controlled treatment phase (weeks 0 to 16), an apremilast 
extension phase (weeks 16 to 52), and a 14-week observational follow-up phase. In the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase of the study, paediatric subjects were randomized in a 2 (apremilast):1 
(placebo)ratio for the first 16 weeks. Subjects 20 to `<50 kg received apremilast 20 mg twice daily (BID) or 
placebo BID, and subjects ≥ 50 kg received apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo  BID. Treatment assignment

was stratified by baseline age group (6 to 11 years or 12 to 17 years). At week 16, subjects in the placebo 
group were switched to apremilast.  
A total of 245 subjects were enrolled (163 subjects were randomized to the apremilast group and 82 subjects 
were  randomized  to  the  placebo  group).  All  163  subjects  (100%)in  the  apremilast  group  and  80  subjects 
(97.6%) in the placebo group received at least 1 dose of investigational product. In the apremilast and placebo 
groups, 149 subjects (91.4%) and 72 subjects (87.8%), respectively, completed the placebo-controlled phase. 
The study met its primary endpoint with an adjusted treatment difference of 21.7% (95% CI: 11.2, 32.1; p < 
0.0001)  between  apremilast  and  placebo  in  the  proportion  of  paediatric  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe 
plaque psoriasis achieving an sPGA response of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at week 16 with at least a 2-point 
reduction  from  baseline.  Sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  the  robustness  of  the  primary  analysis  results  and 
subgroup analyses showed generally consistent treatment effects in favour of apremilast, including in baseline 
weight and age subgroups. 
The study also met its major secondary endpoint with an adjusted treatment difference of 29.4% (95% CI: 
17.8,  40.9;  p  <  0.0001)  between  apremilast  and  placebo  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  PASI-75 
response  at  week  16.    Among  subjects  originally  randomized  to  apremilast  who  continued  with  apremilast 
treatment after week 16, continuous improvements in sPGA and PASI-75 response rates were observed through 
week  52.  Among  subjects  originally  randomized  to  placebo  who  were  switched  to  apremilast  at  week  16, 
improvements  in  sPGA  and  PASI-75  response  rates  were  observed  after  initiation  of  apremilast  treatment 
through week 52. 
Overall, apremilast 20 or 30 mg was well tolerated in these paediatric subjects. The types of adverse events 
were similar to those observed in adult subjects. Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache 
were the most frequently reported adverse events. No serious gastrointestinal adverse events were reported 
during the study. No adverse events of depression were reported during the study. An adverse event of suicidal 
ideation was reported in the placebo group and none in the apremilast group. The rate of psoriasis flare was 
lower for apremilast-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects in the placebo-controlled phase. 
Psoriasis  rebound  was  reported  for  4  subjects  after  apremilast  treatment.  The  subject  incidence  of  adverse 
events leading to discontinuation was similar for the apremilast and placebo groups. No new safety findings 
were identified when apremilast was used in paediatric subjects. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Receipt of the completed study report for Study CC-10004-PPSO-003 (20200056) in accordance with Article 
46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  (the  ‘Paediatric  Regulation’)  is  acknowledged.  The  study  report  is 
submitted  as  a  stand-alone  post  authorization  measure.  As  the  applicant  is  planning  to  submit  a  Type  II 
variation application directly upon conclusion of this Article 46 procedure this study will not be further assessed 
at this point. A full assessment of the study will be conducted as part of the impending variation (Nov 23). Thus 
no further queries or recommendations for updates to the SmPC are proposed at this time. 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a variation prior to making 
any conclusion on product information amendments. The MAH has committed to submit this variation 
application in November 2023.

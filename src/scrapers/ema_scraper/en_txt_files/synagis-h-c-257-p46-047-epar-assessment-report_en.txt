1.  Introduction 
On  17  November  2016,  the  MAH  submitted  a  final  study  report  for  the  post-marketing  observational 
paediatric  studies  P10-128  and  P11-060,  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
1901/2006, as amended. These two Polish studies were similar, but conducted during 2008-2009 and 
2010, respectively.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  states,  that  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  the  studies  is  consistent  with  the  previously 
established benefit risk profile of Synagis and does not recommend any changes to the SmPC. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH has submitted: 
Studies P10-128 and P11-060, both entittled:  "Multicentre, Retrospective, Non-interventional Study to 
Evaluate  the  Incidence  of  Respiratory  Infections  in  Children  with  BPD  Receiving  Prophylaxis  with 
Synagis. 
The  MAH  confirms  that  these  studies  are  stand-alone  and  does  not  form  part  of  a  development 
programme. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study. 
Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ) specific for the fusion protein (F-protein) of 
RSV  that  has  potent  neutralizing  and  fusion-inhibitory  activity  against  a  broad  range  of  RSV  isolates. 
Based on clinical studies in premature infants and children with chronic lung  disease the product was 
licensed  in  the  US  in  1998  and  in  the  EU  in  1999.  Further  studies  were  subsequently  conducted  in 
different patient groups. The currently approved indications are: 
SYNAGIS  is  indicated  for  the  prevention  of  serious  lower  respiratory  tract  disease  requiring 
hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:  
• Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV 
season.  
• Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the 
last 6 months.  
• Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.”  
The pharmaceutical formulations used in these studies were: 
In the EU palivizumab in a lyophilized formulation of and a liquid solution for injection are approved in 
the  EU.  Lyophilized  palivizumab  (maximum  of  5  doses)  was  administered  as  recommended  by  the 
manufacturer and product label with an interval of 30 days between subsequent doses.

2.3.   Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Synagis  (Pavalizumab)  received  marketing  authorization  through  the  centralised  procedure  in  1999. 
Synagis  was  approved  for  the  prevention  of  serious  lower-respiratory-tract  disease  requiring 
hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease: 
-children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than six months of age at the onset of the RSV 
season; 
-children  less  than two  years  of  age  and  requiring  treatment  for  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia 
(BPD) within the last six months; 
-children  less  than two  years  of  age  and  with  haemodynamically  significant  congenital  heart  disease 
(CHD). 
 The MAH submitted a final report for:

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Study P11-060 
In total, over 2001 palivizumab doses were administered. Children were given from 1 to 5 palivizumab 
doses (mean 3.6 ± 1). Mean interval between subsequent palivizumab doses ranged from 29 to 32 
days. 
Study P10-128 
In total, 1240 palivizumab doses were administered. Children received from 1 to 5 palivizumab doses. 
Mean interval between subsequent palivizumab doses ranged from 30 to 38 days. 
Baseline data 
Study P11-060 
Palivizumab was administered to 557 children [female: 302 (54%), male: 255 (46%)]. The number of 
enrolled patients in specific centers ranged from 3 to 68 (mean: 22 ± 17). The age range of enrolled 
children  was  4  weeks  to  2  years,  with  mean  age  of  39  ±  21  weeks.  Mean  age  of  infants  receiving 
prophylaxis varied for specific centers. 
Patient gestational age ranged from 22 to 34 weeks (median 26), and birth weight from 450 to 2730 
grams (median 900). 
Study P10-128 
Palivizumab was administered to 464 children [female: 214 (46%), male: 250 (54%)]. The number of 
enrolled  pediatric  patients  in  specific  centers  ranged  from  2  to  44  (mean  ±  SD  17.8  ±  12.6). 
Distribution  of  patient  sex  remained  relatively  uniform  throughout  all  centers.  The  age  range  of 
enrolled children was 3 to 45 weeks, with a mean age of 23 ± 10 weeks. Mean age of infants receiving 
prophylaxis  varied  for  specific  centers.  Patient  gestational  age  ranged  from  22  to  29  weeks  (median 
27), and birth weight from 400 to 1880 grams (median 900).

Effectiveness results 
Study P11-060 
Four  hundred  thirty-six  (436)  episodes  of  respiratory  infection  were  reported.  The  proportion  of 
patients experiencing at least one episode of respiratory tract infection decreased from 23% after dose 
1  to  7.5%  following  the  fifth  dose  of  palivizumab  (Fisher's  exact  test:  p  =  0.001).  There  was  a 
statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  mean  number  of  respiratory  infection  episodes  per  infant 
decreasing from 0.24 ± 0.46 after the first dose to 0.08 ± 0.27 after dose 5 (Kruskal-Wallis analysis, p 
< 0.001). 
Decrease  in  the  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  episode  of  respiratory  infection  was 
mainly due to systematic, statistically significant decrease in the number of infection episodes affecting 
the  lower  airways  (a  total  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  and  mixed  infections).  After  the  first 
dose  of  palivizumab,  episodes  of  lower  airway  infection  were  46%  of  all  infections;  after  dose  5  no 
episodes were reported (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). 
A  total  of  183  hospitalization  episodes  were  reported,  including  91  (49.7%)  caused  by  respiratory 
diseases. The percentage of all hospitalized patients decreased from 10.2% from dose 1 to 2.2% after 
the fifth dose (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01). 
Mean  number  of  respiratory-related  hospitalizations  per  infant  decreased  from  0.05  ±  0.23  after  the 
first dose to 0 following the fifth dose of palivizumab (Kruskal-Wallis analysis, p < 0.01). Additionally, 
there  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  duration  of  hospitalization  episodes  from  15  ±  12 
days after dose 1 to 6 ± 2 days after dose 4 (Kruskal-Wallis analysis, p = 0.01). 
Study P10-128 
Two hundred and two (202) episodes of respiratory infection were reported. 
The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  episode  of  respiratory  tract  infection  was 
approximately  the  same  between  doses  1  and  4.  No  episodes  were  reported  after  5  doses  from  6 
patients.  Mean  number  of  respiratory  infection  episodes  per  child  following  immunoprophylaxis  doses 
remained stable. Mean number of lower respiratory infections significantly decreased from 0.07 ± 0.25 
after dose 1 to 0.03 ± 0.16 after dose 3 and 0.02 ± 0.13 after dose 4. 
A total of 124 hospitalization episodes in 114 patients (25%, 114/464) were reported. Mean number of 
all hospitalizations in the period of 35 days postdose decreased from 0.12 ± 0.1 after dose 1 to 0.05 ± 
0.05  after  dose  4,  but  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  Causes  were  not  specified  for  5 
hospitalizations.  Of  the  remaining  119  hospitalizations,  53  (44%,  53/119)  were  due  to  respiratory 
disease. 
Change in the duration of respiration-related hospitalization was not statistically significant. 
For respiratory-related hospitalizations, there was no reported change in the incidence of corticosteroid 
use, bronchodilator administration or assisted respiration following palivizumab doses 1 – 4. 
Safety results 
Study P11-060 
Incidence of adverse reactions following palivizumab administration ranged from 1.2 to 4.8%. Adverse 
reactions  were  first  reported  following  the  administration  of  72  (3.6%)  out  of  the  total  2001  doses 
given. Five children participating in the program died (male-3, female-2). They were of 25 – 30 weeks 
gestational  age,  and  birth  weight  of  700  –  1140  g.  The  children  received  from  2  to  5  doses  of 
palivizumab. Deaths occurred at the age of 4 – 11 months and during the period from 17 to 52 days 
after palivizumab administration, and none of the deaths were related to palivizumab. No cases of RSV 
infection were identified as the cause of death.

Incidence  of  adverse  reactions  following  the  administration  of  a  palivizumab  dose  ranged  from  0  to 
5.2%  (incidence  per  dose  number,  1st  through  5th).  In  total,  36  adverse  reactions  (2.9%,  36/1240 
total  number  of  doses)  were  reported  in  31  children  after  administration  of  32  palivizumab  doses 
(2.6%,  32/1240).  Nervousness  was  the  most  frequently  reported  reaction  (1.1%,  14/1240)  followed 
by fever (6.5%, 8/1240). There was no report of injection site reaction. 
Two children participating in the program died (male 1, female 1). Both were infants born at 24 weeks 
of  gestational  age,  with  birth  weight  of  600  –  700  g.  The  children  received  from  1  to  2  palivizumab 
doses.  Deaths  occurred  at  the  age  of  6  –  8  months,  on  the  6th  and  11th  day  after  palivizumab, 
respectively. No cases of RSV infection were identified as the cause of death. 
2.3.2.   Discussion on clinical aspects 
In these post-marketing observational studies no new safety or efficacy concerns were identified 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The findings from the submitted Polish observational studies seems overall consistent with the 
established efficacy and safety of palivizumab.  
The results submitted in accordance with article 46 of the Pediatric Regulation are in agreement with 
the currently approved SMPC and no further regulatory action is deemed necessary.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Darunavir, administered twice daily (b.i.d.) in combination with low-dose ritonavir (rtv) and with other ARV 
agents, is currently indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adults and 
treatment-experienced paediatric subjects aged ≥ 3 years and ≥ 15 kg body weight.  
Darunavir, administered once daily (q.d.) in combination with low-dose rtv and with other ARV agents, is 
currently indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric subjects from the age of 12 
years and at least 40 kg who are either treatment-naive or treatment-experienced with no darunavir 
resistance-associated mutations (RAMs)*, who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml, and CD4+ cell 
count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. 
With this type II variation, the MAH requests an extension of the indication to:  
Darunavir administered q.d. in combination with low-dose rtv and with other ARV agents, in paediatric 
Assessment report  
EMA/664620/2014 
Page 3/31 
  
  
 
 
 
 
subjects aged 3 to <12 years and weighing ≥ 15 kg who are 1) treatment-naive or 2) treatment experienced 
with no DRV RAMs, plasma HIV-I RNA <100,000 copies/ml, and CD4+ cell count >100x106 cells/l. 
Similar to the development of DRV/rtv in adults, the paediatric clinical development program focused first on 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children, and progressed from older to younger children: a weight 
based DRV/rtv twice daily (b.i.d.) regimen has been investigated in trial TMC114-C212 in 
treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 6 to < 18 years of age, followed by trial 
TMC114-TiDP29-C228 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 3 to < 6 years of age. In addition, 
after at least 32 weeks of treatment with the twice daily regimen, the pharmacokinetics of a DRV/rtv once 
daily (q.d.) regimen was evaluated in a subset of TMC114-C228 patients after a 2 week once daily treatment 
period. Finally, the use of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve adolescents between 12 to < 
18 years of age has been investigated in TMC114-TiDP29-C230. 
The registration of the darunavir oral suspension in 2012 allows for dosing in the young age groups 
(EMEA/H/C/707/X/041/G). 
In the present application, the proposed extension of the q.d. indication to subjects aged 3 to <12 years who 
are a) treatment-naïve or b) treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs, plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 
copies/mL, and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100x106 cells/L, is supported by data from:  
the 2-week qd substudy of Phase 2 study TMC114-C228 in treatment-experienced subjects aged 3 to 
<6years, along with results from model-based pharmacokinetic simulations;  
extrapolation of efficacy data from adults treated with DRV/rtv qd (Phase 3 study TMC114-C211 in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and study TMC114-TiDP31-C229 in treatment-experienced HIV-1 
infected adults with no DRV RAMs), and data from pediatric subjects aged 12 to <18 years and weighing ≥
40 kg treated with DRV/rtv qd (study TMC114-TiDP29-C230); 
safety data from pediatric clinical studies and Compassionate Use (CU) and other programs up to a cut-off   
date of 31 October 2013. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
During the assessment procedure, the MAH was requested to address preclinical safety margins and in vitro 
affinity to off target receptors.  It was re-itererated by the MAH that for the original submission of DRV for 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, all preclinical safety margins were calculated assuming a DRV Cmax 
of 10,000 ng/mL. As such, those previously established preclinical margins for DRV could apply to this 
pediatric population as well.  No further preclinical data are available for DRV on in vitro affinity to off-target 
receptors.  
In the absence of clinical safety signals and PK/PD (safety) relationships for DRV, it is considered that the 
proposed dosing regimens for the pediatric population are justified. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity /environmental risk assessment 
For type II variations, the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if there is an increase in 
the environmental exposure e.g. a new indication may result in a significant increase in the extent of the use 
(Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/664620/2014 
Page 4/31 
  
  
 
Based on the current total Prezista sale volume, the naïve indication in children aged 3 to < 12 years of age 
is not expected to increase on the total environmental exposure. Hence, the MAH didn’t submit an updated 
Environmental Risk Assessment with this application. 
The justification by the MAH is considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP agrees with the MAH that no 
increase in the environmental exposure is expected.

2.3.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
A total of 10 HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects were treated with study medication in the once daily 
sub-study TMC114-C228. 
Treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to <6 years of age who participated in 
study TMC114-C228, and who had a confirmed viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml after 24 weeks of 
treatment, could participate in the once-daily sub-study of this study. These subjects had their weight-based 
DRV/rtv twice-daily dosing regimen in the main study switched for 2 weeks to a target dose of DRV/rtv 40/7 
mg/kg once daily for subjects weighing 10 to <15 kg and a dose of 600/100 mg once daily for subjects 
weighing ≥ 15 kg; their optimized background regimen (OBR) of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs from the main 
study was continued. After completion of the rich PK sampling of DRV and rtv in plasma at Week 2 of the 
once-daily sub-study, all subjects reverted back to their DRV/rtv twice-daily dosing regimen in the main 
study. 
The population PK model for DRV, consisting of adult and paediatric (TMC114-C212, TMC114-C228, 
TMC125-C206, TMC125-C216) PK data, was updated with the results of the once-daily sub-study of 
TMC114-C228 and study TMC114-C230 (a study in treatment-naive paediatric subjects aged from 12 to <18 
years). This model was then used to simulate dosing regimens to recommend a weight-based once-daily 
dose of DRV in combination with rtv for paediatric subjects from 3 to <12 years of age and weighing ≥15 kg. 
The objective of this model-based simulation was to achieve PK exposures (AUC24h) and plasma trough 
concentrations (C0h) in the HIV-1 infected paediatric population that were similar to those observed when 
DRV/rtv is administered at a dose of 800/100 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected adults (treatment-naive and 
treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs). A target exposure (AUC24h) of 89.7 µh.h/ml was used, which 
represents the geometric mean DRV AUC24h observed in treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adults (study 
TMC114-C211). Darunavir AUC24h and C0h, when DRV is administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, 
is similar between treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adults and HIV-1 infected adults who are 
treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs. 
The DRV doses selected for use in the sub-study were based on simulations of DRV exposures using a 
previously developed population PK model for DRV updated to accommodate data from HIV-1 infected 
paediatric subjects from 3 to <18 years of age treated with a twice-daily regimen. Simulations for the 
expected DRV exposure according to the 5th, 50th (ie, median), and 95th percentile of α1 acid glycoprotein 
(AAG) in paediatric subjects from 3 to <6 years of age and weighing from 10 to <20 kg were performed for 
3 different dosing strategies (see figure 1). The objective of this simulation was to determine a convenient 
Assessment report

dose of DRV that would target the arithmetic mean exposure of DRV in adults when treated with DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg once daily (ie, 93.0 μg.h/ml) while minimizing the risk of under-dosing. 
The expected DRV exposure in dosing regimens A and C was considered insufficient, particularly for 
paediatric subjects with AAG below the median and with lower body weight. Dosing regimen B was 
implemented for the once-daily sub-study of TMC114-C228, i.e., 40 mg/kg once daily for subjects weighing 
less than 15 kg and 600 mg once daily for subjects weighing at least 15 kg (both co-administered with rtv), 
because this dosing strategy best fit the set objectives. This dosing strategy was endorsed by the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board for the study. 
The mean plasma concentration-time curve for DRV obtained in the sub-study is shown in figure 2. The 
maximum mean plasma concentrations were reached at 3 hours after intake of DRV/rtv.

The PK parameters for DRV are summarized in table 1. Based on the coefficient of variation (CV), the 
inter-individual variabilities of the minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), the maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax), and AUC24h were 59%, 27%, and 38%, respectively. 
When compared with historical data for DRV administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults (sub-study of TMC114-C211), the Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h values 
for DRV in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects from 3 to <6 years of age were 1.33-, 
1.81-, and 1.62-fold higher, respectively, than in the adults (table 1).

800/100 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected adults (study TMC114-C211 sub-study) 
The PK parameters for rtv are summarized in table 2. Based on the CV, the inter-individual variabilities of 
Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h were 47%, 62%, and 47%, respectively. 
When compared with historical data for rtv administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults (sub-study of TMC114-C211), rtv Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h values in 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to <6 years of age were 1.31-, 3.45-, and 
3.40-fold higher, respectively, than in the adults (table 2).

800/100 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected adults (study TMC114-C211 sub-study). 
As indicated, the population pharmacokinetic model is updated after inclusion of the data after once daily 
intake in the TMC114-C228 sub-study and in the TMC114-C230 trial, which was implemented by pooling the 
richly sampled data from the children aged 3 to <6 years in TMC114-C228 and from the children aged 12 to 
<18 years in TMC114-C230 together with the data that were used for the previous model adjustment 
accounting for DRV/rtv b.i.d. intake in children aged 3 to <18 years.

The dataset for the TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study consisted of 10 individuals, with 59 observations after two 
weeks of treatment. The dataset for TMC114-C230 consisted of 12 individuals, with 71 observations after 
two weeks of treatment. The overall dataset for the parameter estimation, including the data from the 
ARIEL, DELPHI and DUET studies, consisted of 659 observations from 102 subjects (72 children and 30 
adults). 
The pharmacokinetic parameter values for darunavir were estimated in NONMEM using the paediatric 
population PK model, i.e. a two-compartment model with a first-order absorption (parameterized as KA and 
fixed to the previously obtained value). The distribution compartment was parameterized in terms of 
apparent volume (V3/F) and apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). Both V3/F and Q/F values were 
fixed. Equation 1 is used to describe the apparent clearance of darunavir as was determined previously. 
Equation 1: 
Where CL/Fi is the apparent oral clearance of an individual, CLint/F the population estimate of apparent 
intrinsic clearance, KAFF is the population estimate for the affinity of darunavir to alpha1-acid glycoprotein 
(AAG) and was fixed to its previously obtained value, θ is the influence of the individual weight (WTi) on 
apparent clearance and ηi is the individual random effect. Frel is the population estimate of the relative 
bioavailability correction for the commercial tablet formulation (Frel=1.18, fixed value) compared to the 
previously used clinical trial tablet formulation as determined in the original model in adults. 
For V2/F, the model was adjusted as follows: 
The model parameters are shown in the table 3 below. 
Table 3: Darunavir parameter estimates for the original pediatric population pharmacokinetic 
model.

The parameter estimates obtained from the model update are shown in table 4. Only slight changes in the 
parameter estimates are observed for CL/F and V2/F, compared to the model developed for children from 3 
to ≤ 18 years old after b.i.d administration. The influence of body weight on CL/F and V2/F was unchanged. 
The major impact of the model adjustment was the increase of V3/F and Q/F. Due to the once daily dosing, 
more information was gathered on these parameters, allowing their estimation. IIV on V2/F and V3/F on the 
other hand were too small to be properly estimated compared to the previous model. The goodness-of-fit 
plots for the adjusted model showed that the bias in the individual prediction versus the observation is 
minimal. 
Table 4: Darunavir population PK parameters after update. 
The arithmetic mean darunavir exposure is 120 µg.h/ml (see table 5) which represents 129% of the target 
(exposure arithmetic mean of 93.0 µg.h/ml in ARTEMIS study). The geometric mean darunavir exposure is 
115 µg.h/ml which represents 128% of the target geometric mean (exposure geometric mean of 89.7 
µg.h/ml in ARTEMIS study).  
Table 5. Summary statistics of the median individual pharmacokinetic parameters in the 
TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study. 
The fact that the mean exposure is on the upper side of the target may be explained by two individuals 
having a high exposure. These two subjects exhibited high AAG values and low body weight, as illustrated in 
figure 3, therefore, low clearances and high exposures were expected.

The blue dotted lines represent the target adult exposure (geometric mean) and its 80-130% 
associated interval. 
The results of the population PK analysis of DRV at Week 2 of the sub-study were consistent with the 
non-compartmental PK analysis. 
The arithmetic mean AUC24h for DRV was 120 μg.h/mL, which was 1.29-fold higher than the arithmetic 
mean of the target adult exposure in study TMC114-C211 (93.0 μg.h/ml). The geometric mean AUC24h for 
DRV was 115 μg.h/ml, which was 1.28-fold higher than the geometric mean of the target DRV exposure in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults in study TMC114-C211 (89.7 μg.h/ml). 
Simulated dosing regimens were investigated for their ability to achieve DRV exposures that were close to 
the target adult exposure while minimizing the pill burden and permitting a switch from the DRV oral 
suspension to a DRV tablet formulation at the earliest opportunity. While clinical studies were conducted with 
DRV/rtv once-daily treatment in children from 3 to <6 years of age (10 to 20 kg) and from 12 to <18 years 
of age (40 to 65 kg), the adjusted population PK model was used to bridge data to cover also children 6 to 
<12 years of age (20 to 40 kg) for DRV/rtv once-daily dosing.  
Because AAG concentrations were shown to be important determinants for DRV exposure in the population 
PK analysis, simulations were performed using the 5th, 50th (i.e., median) and 95th percentile of AAG 
concentrations observed in TMC114-C228 and TMC114-C230. Based on the typical value of the clearance 
parameter obtained in the updated popPK analysis (see table 4), the expected DRV exposures (AUC24h) for 
different dosing regimens were simulated over a weight range of 10 to 65 kg. 
The investigated weight range was divided into 5 weight bands: 10 to 15 kg, 15 to 20 kg, 20 to 30 kg, 30 to 
40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg. For each of these weight bands, various dosing regimens were simulated, taking the 
available DRV tablet strengths (75-, 400-, and 600-mg tablets) and the DRV oral suspension (100-mg/ml 
suspension) into consideration. The following once-daily regimens were explored for DRV: 
•  30, 35, and 40 mg/kg for the 10 to 15 kg weight band 
•  30 and 35 mg/kg, and 600 mg for the 15 to 20 kg weight band 
•  600 and 675 mg for the 20 to 30 kg weight band 
•  675 and 800 mg for the 30 to 40 kg weight band 
•  800 mg for the ≥40 kg weight band 
The simulations assumed the presence of rtv (7 mg/kg or 100 mg q.d.).

30 to <40 kg, and 800/100 mg for subjects weighing ≥ 40 to 65 kg are shown in Figure 4. 
Figure 4: Plots of the expected DRV AUC24h when co-administered with rtv in HIV-1 infected

The mean exposure of DRV achieved with the dosing regimens shown in figure 9 is expected to be within 
80% to 130% of the target DRV exposure in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults in study TMC114-C211 
when AAG concentration is average. This regimen limits the risk of overexposure without compromising 
efficacy, as the lower range of exposure (AUC and C0h) is within observed adult ranges. There is a greater 
chance of achieving a higher DRV exposure in children with higher AAG concentrations. However, no 
association was observed between the exposure of DRV and the development of AEs or laboratory 
abnormalities in DRV studies conducted to date. 
Based on DRV exposure, these proposed dosing regimens could be considered for treatment naïve 
HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects 
without DRV RAMs because DRV exposure is comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 
800/100 mg once daily (table 7).

2.3.3.  Discussion 
A population pharmacokinetic model for darunavir in adults was already available. This model was adjusted 
as follows: 
- adjustment to accommodate the difference in exposure after administration of the clinical trial and the 
commercial tablet formulation. 
-adjustment to accommodate the data from children between the ages of 3 to <18 years old treated b.i.d. 
This model was based on richly sampled plasma concentration profiles obtained in studies TMC114-C228, 
TMC114-C212, TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216 (studies submitted with the original marketing 
authorisation application).  
- update of the model by inclusion of the data obtained after once daily intake (TMC114-C228 sub-study and 
in the TMC114-C230 trial), which was implemented by pooling the richly sampled data from the children 
aged 3 to <6 years in TMC114-C228 and from the children aged 12 to <18 years in TMC114-C230 together 
with the data that were used for the previous model adjustment accounting for DRV/rtv b.i.d. intake in 
children aged 3 to <18 years.  
- This model was then used to simulate once-daily dosing regimens in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects from 
3 to <12 years of age and weighing ≥15 kg that would achieve similar levels of darunavir exposure to those 
observed in HIV-1 infected adults.

Individual darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters for subjects involved in the TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study 
were derived during the population pharmacokinetic analysis as described before. Simulation records were 
added to the dataset to obtain an estimation of the through darunavir plasma concentrations.  
The goodness-of-fit plots from the adjusted model, containing only the data from the TMC114-C228 q.d. 
sub-study subjects, indicate that the model predictions appear to be accurate, with no detectable bias 
present for individual predictions.  
The results of the population PK analysis of DRV at Week 2 of the sub-study were consistent with the 
non-compartmental PK analysis. 
Simulated dosing regimens were investigated for their ability to achieve DRV exposures that were close to 
the target adult exposure while minimizing the pill burden and permitting a switch from the DRV oral 
suspension to a DRV tablet formulation at the earliest opportunity. While clinical studies were conducted with 
DRV/rtv once-daily treatment in children from 3 to <6 years of age (10 to 20 kg) and from 12 to <18 years 
of age (40 to 65 kg), the adjusted population PK model was used to bridge data to cover also children 6 to 
<12 years of age (20 to 40 kg) for DRV/rtv once-daily dosing, which is considered acceptable.  
Different dosing regimens were simulated over a weight range of 10 to 65 kg. For children with a weight of 
10 to <15 kg, a regimen of 35 mg/kg resulted in a similar exposure compared to adult. This also account for 
a DRV q.d. regimen of 600 mg in children of 15 to < 30 kg, although for the 15 – 20 kg exposure was at the 
higher end, it is considered not to be a safety problem and it offers the opportunity of the use of the tablet 
formulation instead of the suspension for the whole group. 
A DRV q.d. regimen of 675 mg is expected to provide comparable exposure to adult in the 30 to <40 kg 
group. From 40 kg and above, the adult DRV/rtv regimen (800/100 mg q.d.) can be used from 40 kg onward 
and leads to similar DRV exposure compared to adult. 
Nonetheless, exposures seen for both darunavir and ritonavir in the phase II study (TMC114- 228) in 3- 6 
years old seem high and are higher than that seen in any adult studies involving chronic dosing.  This is 
particularly true of the Cmax values for both components, with mean values of 10.6 and 2.4 µg/ml for 
darunavir and ritonavir respectively.  Although safety events in this study appear acceptable it is considered 
that the data being in only 10 individuals are too limited to allow a thorough assessment of safety.  Further 
data to support safety with exposures with these Cmax values is required.  In addition a mechanistic PKPD 
discussion of the importance of Cmax for safety based on all data should be provided.  
In addition to this, although the population PK model seems well developed and validated, it seems to be less 
accurate for prediction of higher plasma concentrations regarding Cmax (see diagnostic plots). A similar 
divergence is seen for the plots for the study in the 3-6 year olds.  This is often the case for these models 
where Cmax is less well defined due to sparse sampling. In general it appears that the model will under 
predict the Cmax. Further diagnostic plots are therefore required to show the accuracy of prediction of the 
plasma concentration profiles in the children for which PK data are available.  However it is accepted that if 
sufficient data are provided from previous studies to support safety at the exposures seen in the clinical 
study for 3 - 6 year olds then the model is probably judged sufficient to bridge to simulate similar exposures 
in the other age categories. 
Based on DRV exposure, these proposed dosing regimens could be considered for treatment naïve HIV-1 
infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without 
DRV RAMs because DRV exposure is comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults 
and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
once daily. 
Based upon these data, the SmPC proposes the following dose regimens: 
ART naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kilograms). 
The weight based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below.

Table 8 
ART experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kilograms) PREZISTA 
twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended. 
A once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients with 
prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated mutations 
(DRV RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV 1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count  100 cells x 
106/l.

DRV RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V 
The weight based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below. The 
recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the recommended adult dose 
(600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily). 
Table 9 
With regard to the recommended doses, in the POPPK model weight is a covariate with an exponent of 0.502 
(i.e., somewhat lower than the value of 0.75 normally expected), although it is accepted that AAG is also a 
covariate in the model which can also influence the relationship.  The relationship with weight would suggest 
lower doses in each of the age categories would achieve the target drug exposure as defined in the adult 
population (see table below for comparison of MAH’s proposal and assessor’s calculation of dose required in 
children by scaling the adult dose with body weight with the exponent 0.502. 
In the TMC114-C228 once daily substudy, a darunavir/low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv) dosing regimen of 40/7 
mg/kg once daily was evaluated for subjects <15 kg, and a dosing regimen of 600/100 mg once daily for

subjects ≥15 kg. Table 10 displays the individual maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values observed 
with their DRV/rtv allocated treatment. Table 11 presents summary statistics of Cmax per DRV/rtv dosing 
regimen. 
Tables 10 & 11 
It is acknowledged that the DRV/rtv 40/7 mg once daily dose in pediatric subjects weighing less than 15 kg 
could lead to higher Cmax values than those typically observed in adults, as also shown in Table 15. 
Simulations indicated that a DRV/rtv 35/7 mg/kg once daily dose regimen would be more appropriate for the 
pediatric subpopulation of 10 to <15kg. However, this specific pediatric population (<15 kg) is not subject 
of this application. 
For children ≥15 to <30 kg, a DRV/rtv 600/100 mg once daily dosing regimen is proposed, as also evaluated 
in the once daily substudy of TMC114-C228. All children dosed with 600/100 mg once daily in TMC114-C228 
weighed between 16 and 21 kg. As such, it is not unexpected that the observed individual and mean C-max 
for this particular subset of subjects are on the higher end of those anticipated for the full pediatric cohort of 
≥15 to <30 kg. However, the observed Cmax values were still within the range of those observed in other 
studies for children and adults.  
Furthermore, the anticipated DRV exposures with the proposed once daily dosing regimen were also 
compared with the approved twice daily dosing regimen for this pediatric population.  This comparison 
showed that the range of anticipated exposures, including Cmax, is similar for the once daily and twice daily 
regimens. It is acknowledged that there may be some bias in the estimation of Cmax with the population 
pharmacokinetic (popPK) model (which has been further validated), but this bias is anticipated to be 
minimal, and similar for both the once daily and twice daily dosing regimens.

Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed dosing regimens could be considered for treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as 
well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs as the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis indicate that DRV exposure is comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily. However, in the PK substudy higher Cmax levels were observed, which may 
trigger safety concerns. Moreover, although the population pharmacokinetic model predicted a comparable 
exposure, there was uncertainty with regard to the prediction of Cmax and the recommended dose. This 
aspect was however further clarified by the MAH during the variation procedure.    The MAH presented 
additional data indicating that although with the limitations of the model, Cmax values were within the range 
of once daily dosing. As shown in PK figures, the predicted 95th percentile are comparable for recommended 
once and the approved twice daily dosing regimens.  
2.4.  Clinical Efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Once Daily Substudy of TMC114-C228 in Treatment-experienced Pediatric Subjects Aged 3 to <6 
Years  
Study TMC114-C228 has been submitted and assessed within procedure X-41-G. The present 2-week 
pharmacokinetic substudy of TMC114-C228 was performed between Weeks 32 and 40 to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of DRV/rtv q.d. dosing. Dosing recommendations for the DRV/rtv q.d. substudy were 
based on the updated pharmacokinetic model of DRV with the rich pharmacokinetic data obtained at Week 
2 with the b.i.d. dosing regimen of DRV/rtv in the main study TMC114-C228. 
Ten treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children aged 3 to <6 years and weighing between 10 and <20 kg 
were treated with DRV/rtv qd for 2 weeks. Seven subjects received DRV/rtv 600/96 mg qd, and 3 subjects 
were to receive DRV/rtv 560/92 mg (40/7 mg/kg) qd. However, due to the accuracy constraints of the rtv 
pipette, the actual rtv dose for the latter 3 subjects was also 96 mg qd. 
The main objective of the q.d. dosing TMC114-C228 substudy was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
DRV/rtv at steady-state after q.d. dosing in HIV-1 infected children, aged from 3 to < 6 years at screening 
and weighing between 10 and < 20 kg at screening, with a confirmed undetectable plasma viral load (< 50 
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) at Week 32. See section 2.3 on details. The secondary objective was to evaluate the 
short-term safety and tolerability. AEs were monitored, as part of the main study, on an ongoing basis from 
signing the ICF onwards until the last study-related visit. 
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  There was no randomisation. The study was open label. 
All subjects participating in the substudy remained undetectable (< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) after 2 weeks 
of DRV/rtv q.d. dosing.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
This small 2-week pharmacokinetic substudy of TMC114-C228 was intended to collect data on 
pharmacokinetics. There is very limited data on efficacy, all 10 subjects maintained undetectable plasma 
viral load (< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL).  However, efficacy of the once daily dose regimen in treatment naïve 
children can be extrapolated from adults.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the 
expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an extrapolation of efficacy data 
obtained in adults to children may be accepted. 
As DRV exposure in treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced 
HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs was found to be comparable to that observed in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs 
when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, efficacy of 800/100 mg once daily DRV/rtv can be 
assumed. 
2.5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.5.1.  Studies 
Once Daily Substudy of TMC114-C228 in Treatment-experienced Pediatric Subjects Aged 3 to <6 
Years 
The secondary objective of this substudy was to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability. AEs were 
monitored, as part of the main study, on an ongoing basis from signing the ICF onwards until the last 
study-related visit. 
Four AEs occurred in 2 subjects: cough and rhinorrhea in 1 subject, and ear pain and oropharyngeal pain in 
1 subject. Each of these AEs were grade 1 in severity, and none were considered by the investigator related 
to DRV. There were no grade 2 to 4 AEs, no serious adverse events (SAEs), no deaths, and no AEs led to 
discontinuation. There were no AEs related to physical of neurologic examinations, weight, or laboratory 
assessment. 
The safety results of the qd substudy of TMC114-C228 are in line with those of the main part of the study. 
There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in 
HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects aged 6 to <18 years. 
Safety in Other Clinical Studies and Programs 
In total 180 HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects <18 years of age have been treated with DRV/rtv in the 
ongoing CU program (or exceptionally EAPs or PAA programs) up to the cut-off date of 31 October 2013. 
Sixty-six of these subjects were <12 years of age. Each of the 180 treated subjects had limited treatment 
options due to virologic failure or intolerance to multiple ARV regimens. Between 1 August 2012 and 31 
October 2013, 2 new SAEs were reported in 1 subject <12 years of age. Both SAEs (viral load increased and 
diarrhea) were considered by the reporting physician as at least possibly related to DRV/rtv.  
Assessment report  
EMA/664620/2014 
Page 19/31 
  
  
 
Nine new SAEs were reported in 6 subjects <18 years of age and treated with DRV/rtv in the ongoing 
continued-access study TMC114-C232. Two of these SAEs (pneumonia and asthma) occurred in 1 subject 
who was <12 years of age. Follow-up information was received for 6 pediatric subjects with 10 SAEs that 
started prior to 1 August 2012. Seven of these SAEs (appendicitis, tuberculosis, intestinal obstruction, 
asthma, pneumonia, road traffic accident, and femur fraction) occurred in 4 subjects <12 years of age. All 
events (new and follow-up cases) were assessed as not related to DRV/rtv by the investigator. 
None of the SAEs reported between 1 August 2012 and 31 October 2013 had a fatal outcome. No new ADRs 
were identified and no new safety concerns emerged from these data that would affect the benefit/risk 
assessment for the use of DRV/rtv in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in 
HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged 6 to <18 years. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in 
HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects aged 6 to <18 years.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 (75/150/300/600 mg tablets), 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the 
SmPCs of Prezista have been updated.   The package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
(Prezista 75 mg Tables SmPC shown as example) 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
PREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. 
PREZISTA 75 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see section 4.2): 
● 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult patients, 
including those that have been highly pre-treated. 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg 
body weight. 
● 
In deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations 
associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history 
should guide the use of PREZISTA. 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration (oral suspension)

ART-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) 
The weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below.

600 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir once daily 
675 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir once daily 
800 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir once daily 
ART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) 
PREZISTA twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended. 
A once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients with 
prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated mutations 
(DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count 
≥ 100 cells x 106/l. 
*  DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V 
The weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below. The 
recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the recommended adult dose 
(600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily).

For ART-experienced paediatric patients HIV genotypic testing is recommended. However, when HIV 
genotypic testing is not feasible, the PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimen is recommended in HIV 
protease inhibitor-naïve paediatric patients and the twice daily dosing regimen is recommended in HIV 
protease inhibitor-experienced patients. 
[…] 
Paediatric patients 
PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in children with a body weight of less than 15 kg as the dose for this 
population has not been established in a sufficient number of patients (see section 5.1). PREZISTA/ritonavir 
should not be used in children below 3 years of age because of safety concerns (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
Darunavir exposures in treatment-naïve adolescents 12 to 17 years weighing at least 40 kg receiving 
PREZISTA 800 mg once daily have been determined and were found to be within the therapeutic range as 
has been established in adults receiving PREZISTA 800 mg once daily. As a consequence, since PREZISTA 
once daily has also been registered for use in treatment-experienced adults without darunavir resistance 
associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell 
count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l, the same indication of PREZISTA once daily applies to treatment-experienced 
children 3 to 17 years weighing at least 15 kg.

[…] 
ART-experienced patients – once daily dosing 
PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced patients 
should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) or 
HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2). Combinations with 
optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been studied in this population. 
Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see section 5.1).

The pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 10 treatment 
experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to < 20 kg, showed that 
weight based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in adults 
receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, pharmacokinetic 
modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages of 3 to < 18 years 
confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed the identification of weight 
based PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric patients weighing at least 15 kg that are

3.  Overall conclusion 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the 
expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, the extrapolation of efficacy data 
obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  The efficacy of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg qd in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected adults was established in Phase 3 study TMC114-C211 and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 
infected adults with no DRV RAMs in the Phase 3 study TMC114-C229. The use of the DRV/rtv qd regimen in 
paediatric subjects aged 12 to <18 years and weighing ≥40 kg was established in study 
TMC114-TiDP29-C230 (assessed II/54). 
As DRV exposure in treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced 
HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs was found to be comparable to that observed in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs 
when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, efficacy of 800/100 mg once daily DRV/rtv can be 
assumed. 
In a small 2-week pharmacokinetic substudy of TMC114-C228 ten treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected 
children aged 3 to <6 years and weighing between 10 and <20 kg were treated with DRV/rtv qd for 2 weeks. 
Seven subjects received DRV/rtv 600/96 mg qd, and 3 subjects received DRV/rtv 560/96 mg (40/7 mg/kg) 
qd. All subjects maintained undetectable plasma viral load ( < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) after 2 weeks.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The only data on efficacy for the present extension of indication stems from the substudy of TMC114-C228 
in treatment experienced children. This is very limited data.  However, efficacy of the once daily dose 
regimen in treatment naïve children can be extrapolated from adults when exposure is comparable. 
However, in the PK substudy higher Cmax levels were observed, which may trigger safety concerns. 
Moreover, although the population pharmacokinetic model predicted a comparable exposure, there could be 
uncertainty with regard to the prediction of Cmax and the recommended dose. This  has been further  
clarified though, with no indication that higher exposures (i.e.  ≥ 10,000 to <15,000 ng/mL, or ≥ 15,000 
ng/mL) would result in an increase in AEs, increased toxicity.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in 
HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged 6 to <18 years. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Larger studies are required to assess the long-term effects of DRV on lipid and growth parameters. The 
on-going PASS study “Pharmacovigilance study on the safety and use of DRV in HIV infected children and 
adolescents in Europe” will provide this information. Annual reports from the on-going PASS study are being 
submitted to the CHMP. In addition, the MAH will initiate a study to compare of the data on growth from 
children treated with darunavir and other ART products. A study protocol has been submitted by the MAH in 
March 2014 and is currently under assessment (EMEA/H/C/000707/MEA069). 
Benefit-risk balance 
As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data support robust 
dose recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  
Exposures with the once daily dose of 600/100 mg DRV/rtv as recommended for treatment-naïve children 
weighing ≥15kg and <30kg are similar to the once daily regimen of 800/100 mg DRV/rtv in adults and 
comparable to exposures with twice daily dosing as recommended in paediatric and adult patients. As such, 
safety and efficacy can be extrapolated. There seems no indication that higher exposures (i.e.  ≥ 10,000 to 
<15,000 ng/mL, or ≥ 15,000 ng/mL) would result in an increase in AEs, increased toxicity.  
The safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new clinically relevant findings 
compared with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 infected adults.  Lipid abnormalities and growth 
impairment were identified as potential risks related to the use of darunavir in treatment-naïve HIV-1 
infected adolescents and adequate measures have been put in place to monitor those.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
EDURANT, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment 
of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients 
12 years of age and older with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml.
Genotypic resistance testing should guide the use of EDURANT (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
The recommended dose of EDURANT is one 25 mg tablet taken once daily. EDURANT must be 
taken with a meal (see section 5.2).
Dose adjustment
For patients concomitantly receiving rifabutin, the EDURANT dose should be increased to 50 mg (two 
tablets of 25 mg each) taken once daily. When rifabutin co-administration is stopped, the EDURANT 
dose should be decreased to 25 mg once daily (see section 4.5).
Missed dose
If the patient misses a dose of EDURANT within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient 
must take the medicine with a meal as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a 
patient misses a dose of EDURANT by more than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed 
dose, but resume the usual dosing schedule.
If a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking the medicine, another EDURANT tablet should be taken 
with a meal. If a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking the medicine, the patient does not need 
to take another dose of EDURANT until the next regularly scheduled dose.

Special populations
Elderly
There is limited information regarding the use of EDURANT in patients > 65 years of age. No dose 
adjustment of EDURANT is required in older patients (see section 5.2). EDURANT should be used 
with caution in this population.
Renal impairment
EDURANT has mainly been studied in patients with normal renal function. No dose adjustment of 
rilpivirine is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease, rilpivirine should be used with caution. In patients with severe 
renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, the combination of rilpivirine with a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor (e.g., ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitor) should only be used if the benefit outweighs 
the risk (see section 5.2).
Treatment with rilpivirine resulted in an early small increase of mean serum creatinine levels which 
remained stable over time and is not considered clinically relevant (see section 4.8).
Hepatic impairment
There is limited information regarding the use of EDURANT in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh score A or B). No dose adjustment of EDURANT is required in patients with 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment. EDURANT should be used with caution in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment. EDURANT has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh score C). Therefore, EDURANT is not recommended in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of EDURANT in children aged < 12 years have not yet been established.
No data are available.
Pregnancy
Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed during pregnancy, therefore viral load should be 
monitored closely. Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen could be considered (see 
sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2).
Method of administration
EDURANT must be taken orally, once daily with a meal (see section 5.2). It is recommended that the 
film-coated tablet be swallowed whole with water and not be chewed or crushed.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
EDURANT should not be co-administered with the following medicinal products, as significant 
decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations may occur (due to CYP3A enzyme induction or gastric 
pH increase), which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of EDURANT (see section 4.5):
the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin
-
the antimycobacterials rifampicin, rifapentine
-
proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, 
-
rabeprazole
the systemic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Virologic failure and development of resistance
EDURANT has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other 
antiretroviral therapy. The list of rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations presented in section 5.1 
should only guide the use of EDURANT in the treatment-naïve population.
In the pooled efficacy analysis from the Phase III trials in adults through 96 weeks, patients treated 
with rilpivirine with a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml had a greater risk of 
virologic failure (18.2% with rilpivirine versus 7.9% with efavirenz) compared to patients with a 
baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (5.7% with rilpivirine versus 3.6% with 
efavirenz). The greater risk of virologic failure for patients in the rilpivirine arm was observed in the 
first 48 weeks of these trials (see section 5.1). Patients with a baseline viral load 
> 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml who experienced virologic failure exhibited a higher rate of 
treatment-emergent resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class. 
More patients who failed virologically on rilpivirine than who failed virologically on efavirenz 
developed lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance (see section 5.1).
Findings in adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) in trial TMC278-C213 were generally in line 
with these data (for details see section 5.1).
Only adolescents deemed likely to have good adherence to antiretroviral therapy should be treated 
with rilpivirine, as suboptimal adherence can lead to development of resistance and the loss of future
treatment options.
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing should guide the use of rilpivirine
(see section 5.1).
Cardiovascular
At supra-therapeutic doses (75 and 300 mg once daily), rilpivirine has been associated with 
prolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) (see sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.2). 
EDURANT at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant 
effect on QTc. EDURANT should be used with caution when co-administered with medicinal 
products with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any 
inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).
Pregnancy
Edurant should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. 
Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during 
pregnancy. In the Phase III studies, lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen during pregnancy, 
has been associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load should be 
monitored closely (see sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2). Alternatively, switching to another ART regimen 
could be considered.
4
Important information about some of the ingredients of EDURANT
EDURANT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Medicinal products that affect rilpivirine exposure
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A. Medicinal products that induce or 
inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co-administration of 
rilpivirine and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma 
concentrations of rilpivirine, which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine.
Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A has been observed to
increase the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine.
Co-administration of rilpivirine with medicinal products that increase gastric pH may result in
decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of 
EDURANT.
Medicinal products that are affected by the use of rilpivirine
Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the 
exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes.
Rilpivirine inhibits P-glycoprotein in vitro (IC50 is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study, rilpivirine did not 
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. However, it may not be completely excluded that 
rilpivirine can increase the exposure to other medicines transported by P-glycoprotein that are more 
sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition, e.g. dabigatran etexilate.
Rilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC50 of < 2.7 nM. The clinical 
implications of this finding are currently unknown.
Established and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal 
products are listed in table 1.
Interaction table
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
Interactions between rilpivirine and co-administered medicinal products are listed in table 1 (increase 
is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, not applicable as “NA”, confidence interval as 
“CI”).

QT prolonging medicinal products
There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between 
rilpivirine and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG. In a study of healthy 
subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been 
9
shown to prolong the QTc interval of the ECG (see section 5.1). EDURANT should be used with 
caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of rilpivirine (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). Lower exposures of 
rilpivirine were observed during pregnancy, therefore viral load should be monitored closely.
Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The use of rilpivirine may be considered during pregnancy, if necessary.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether rilpivirine is excreted in human milk. Rilpivirine is excreted in the milk of 
rats. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, mothers should be instructed 
not to breast-feed if they are receiving rilpivirine.
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of rilpivirine on fertility are available. No clinically relevant effects on 
fertility were seen in animal studies (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
EDURANT has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue, 
dizziness and somnolence have been reported in some patients taking EDURANT and should be 
considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
During the clinical development program (1,368 patients in the Phase III controlled trials 
TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 (THRIVE)), 55.7% of subjects experienced at least one 
adverse drug reaction (see section 5.1). The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
(≥ 2%) that were at least of moderate intensity were depression (4.1%), headache (3.5%), insomnia 
(3.5%), rash (2.3%), and abdominal pain (2.0%). The most frequent serious treatment-related ADRs
were reported in 7 (1.0%) patients receiving rilpivirine. The median duration of exposure for patients 
in the rilpivirine arm and efavirenz arm was 104.3 and 104.1 weeks, respectively. Most ADRs 
occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment.
Selected treatment emergent clinical laboratory abnormalities (grade 3 or grade 4), considered as 
ADRs, reported in EDURANT treated patients were increased pancreatic amylase (3.8%), increased 
AST (2.3%), increased ALT (1.6%), increased LDL cholesterol (fasted, 1.5%), decreased white blood 
cell count (1.2%), increased lipase (0.9%), increased bilirubin (0.7%), increased triglycerides (fasted, 
0.6%), decreased haemoglobin (0.1%), decreased platelet count (0.1%), and increased total cholesterol 
(fasted, 0.1%).

Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
ADRs reported in adult patients treated with rilpivirine are summarised in Table 2. The ADRs are 
listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, 
ADRs are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

In the rilpivirine arm in the week 96 analysis of the Phase III ECHO and THRIVE trials, mean change 
from baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) was 5 mg/dl, in HDL cholesterol (fasted) 4 mg/dl, in LDL
cholesterol (fasted) 1 mg/dl, and in triglycerides (fasted) -7 mg/dl.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
11
Paediatric population (12 to less than 18 years of age)
The safety assessment is based on the week 48 analysis of the single-arm, open-label, Phase II trial, 
TMC278-C213, in which 36 antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescent patients
weighing at least 32 kg received rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) in combination with other antiretroviral 
agents (see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure for patients was 63.5 weeks. There were no 
patients who discontinued treatment due to ADRs. No new ADRs were identified compared to those 
seen in adults.
Most ADRs were grade 1 or 2. The most common ADRs (all grades, greater than or equal to 10%) 
were headache (19.4%), depression (19.4%), somnolence (13.9%), and nausea (11.1%). No grade 3-4 
laboratory abnormalities for AST/ALT or grade 3-4 ADRs of transaminase increased were reported.
There were no new safety concerns identified in the Week 240 analysis of the TMC278-C213 trial in 
adolescents.
The safety and efficacy of rilpivirine in children aged <12 years have not yet been established. No data 
are available.
Other special populations
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus
In patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic 
enzyme elevation was higher than in patients receiving rilpivirine who were not co-infected. This 
observation was the same in the efavirenz arm. The pharmacokinetic exposure of rilpivirine in 
co-infected patients was comparable to that in patients without co-infection.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific antidote for overdose with EDURANT. Human experience of overdose with 
rilpivirine is limited. Symptoms of overdose may include headache, nausea, dizziness and/or abnormal 
dreams. Treatment of overdose with rilpivirine consists of general supportive measures including 
monitoring of vital signs and ECG (QT interval) as well as observation of the clinical status of the 
patient. Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national 
poisons centre, where available. Since rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma protein, dialysis is unlikely 
to result in significant removal of the active substance.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors, ATC code: J05AG05.
12
Mechanism of action
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1. Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA 
polymerases α, β and γ.
Antiviral activity in vitro
Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected 
T-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/ml). Although rilpivirine
demonstrated limited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 2,510 to 
10,830 nM (920 to 3,970 ng/ml), treatment of HIV-2 infection with rilpivirine is not recommended in 
the absence of clinical data.
Rilpivirine also demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, 
C, D, F, G, H) primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/ml) 
and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/ml).
Resistance
In cell culture
Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different 
origins and subtypes as well as NNRTI resistant HIV-1. The most commonly observed 
resistance-associated mutations that emerged included L100I, K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, 
H221Y, F227C and M230I.
Resistance to rilpivirine was determined as a fold change in EC50 value (FC) above the biological 
cut-off (BCO) of the assay.
In treatment-naïve adult subjects
For the resistance analysis, a broader definition of virologic failure was used than in the primary 
efficacy analysis. In the week 48 pooled resistance analysis from the Phase III trials, 62 (of a total of
72) virologic failures in the rilpivirine arm had resistance data at baseline and time of failure. In this 
analysis, the resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) associated with NNRTI resistance that 
developed in at least 2 rilpivirine virologic failures were: V90I, K101E, E138K, E138Q, V179I, 
Y181C, V189I, H221Y, and F227C. In the trials, the presence of the mutations V90I and V189I, at 
baseline, did not affect response. The E138K substitution emerged most frequently during rilpivirine 
treatment, commonly in combination with the M184I substitution. In the week 48 analysis, 31 out of 
62 of rilpivirine virologic failures had concomitant NNRTI and NRTI RAMs; 17 of those 31 had the 
combination of E138K and M184I. The most common mutations were the same in the week 48 and 
week 96 analyses.
In the week 96 pooled resistance analysis, lower rates of virologic failure were observed in the second 
48 weeks than in the first 48 weeks of treatment. From the week 48 to the week 96 analysis, 24 (3.5%) 
and 14 (2.1%) additional virologic failures occurred in the rilpivirine and efavirenz arm, respectively. 
Of these virologic failures, 9 out of 24 and 4 out of 14 were in subjects with a baseline viral load 
< 100,000 copies/ml, respectively.
In treatment-naïve adolescent subjects
In the week 240 resistance analysis of the TMC278-C213 trial, rilpivirine resistance-associated 
mutations (RAMs) were observed in 46.7% (7/15) of subjects with virologic failure and post-baseline 
genotypic data. All subjects with rilpivirine RAMs also had at least 1 treatment-emergent NRTI RAM 
at the last post-baseline time point with genotypic data.
Considering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data in treatment-naïve subjects, the following 
resistance-associated mutations, when present at baseline, may affect the activity of rilpivirine: 
K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188L, 
13
H221Y, F227C, M230I, and M230L. These rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations should only 
guide the use of EDURANT in the treatment-naïve population. These resistance-associated mutations 
were derived from in vivo data involving treatment-naïve subjects only and therefore cannot be used to 
predict the activity of rilpivirine in subjects who have virologically failed an antiretroviral-containing 
regimen.
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing should guide the use of EDURANT.
Cross-resistance
Site-directed NNRTI mutant virus
In a panel of 67 HIV-1 recombinant laboratory strains with one resistance-associated mutation at RT 
positions associated with NNRTI resistance, including the most commonly found K103N and Y181C, 
rilpivirine showed antiviral activity against 64 (96%) of these strains. The single resistance-associated 
mutations associated with a loss of susceptibility to rilpivirine were: K101P, Y181I and Y181V. The 
K103N substitution did not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine by itself, but the combination 
of K103N and L100I resulted in a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine.
Recombinant clinical isolates
Rilpivirine retained sensitivity (FC ≤ BCO) against 62% of 4,786 HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates 
resistant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine.
Treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients
In the week 96 pooled resistance analysis of the Phase III trials (ECHO and THRIVE), 42 out of 
86 subjects with virologic failure on rilpivirine showed treatment-emergent resistance to rilpivirine 
(genotypic analysis). In these patients, phenotypic cross-resistance to other NNRTIs was noted as 
follows: etravirine 32/42, efavirenz 30/42, and nevirapine 16/42. In patients with a baseline viral load 
≤ 100,000 copies/ml, 9 out of 27 patients with virologic failure on rilpivirine showed 
treatment-emergent resistance to rilpivirine (genotypic analysis), with the following frequency of 
phenotypic cross-resistance: etravirine 4/9, efavirenz 3/9, and nevirapine 1/9.
Effects on electrocardiogram
The effect of rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily on the QTcF interval was 
evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) controlled crossover 
study in 60 healthy adults, with 13 measurements over 24 hours at steady-state. EDURANT at the 
recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc.
When supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily of rilpivirine were studied in 
healthy adults, the maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF 
interval from placebo after baseline correction were 10.7 (15.3) and 23.3 (28.4) ms, respectively. 
Steady-state administration of rilpivirine 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily resulted in a mean 
Cmax approximately 2.6-fold and 6.7-fold, respectively, higher than the mean steady-state Cmax
observed with the recommended 25 mg once daily dose of rilpivirine.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients
The evidence of efficacy of rilpivirine is based on the analysis of 96 week data from 2 randomised, 
double-blinded, active-controlled, Phase III trials TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 
(THRIVE). The trials were identical in design, with the exception of the background regimen (BR). In 
the week 96 efficacy analysis, the virologic response rate [confirmed undetectable viral load 
(< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml)] was evaluated in patients receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily in 
addition to a BR versus patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily in addition to a BR. Similar 
efficacy for rilpivirine was seen in each trial demonstrating non-inferiority to efavirenz.
14
Antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled who had a plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5,000 copies/ml and were screened for susceptibility to N(t)RTIs and for absence of 
specific NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. In ECHO, the BR was fixed to the N(t)RTIs, 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine. In THRIVE, the BR consisted of 
2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine or zidovudine plus 
lamivudine or abacavir plus lamivudine. In ECHO, randomisation was stratified by screening viral 
load. In THRIVE, randomisation was stratified by screening viral load and by N(t)RTI BR.
This analysis included 690 patients in ECHO and 678 patients in THRIVE who had completed 
96 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier.
In the pooled analysis for ECHO and THRIVE, demographics and baseline characteristics were 
balanced between the rilpivirine arm and the efavirenz arm. Table 3 displays selected baseline disease 
characteristics of the patients in the rilpivirine and efavirenz arms.

Table 4 below shows the results of the week 48 and the week 96 efficacy analysis for patients treated 
with rilpivirine and patients treated with efavirenz from the pooled data from the ECHO and THRIVE 
trials. The response rate (confirmed undetectable viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) at week 96 
was comparable between the rilpivirine arm and the efavirenz arm. The incidence of virologic failure 
was higher in the rilpivirine arm than the efavirenz arm at week 96; however, most of the virologic 
failures occurred within the first 48 weeks of treatment. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 
higher in the efavirenz arm at week 96 than the rilpivirine arm. Most of these discontinuations 
occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment.

Subjects achieved virologic response (two consecutive viral loads < 50 copies/ml) and maintained it through week 48/96.
Predicted difference of response rates (95% CI) for the week 48 analysis: 1.6% (-2.2%; 5.3%) and for the week 96 analysis: -0.4% 
(-4.6%; 3.8%); both p-value < 0.0001 (non-inferiority at 12% margin) from logistic regression model, including stratification factors 
and study.
† Virologic failure in pooled efficacy analysis: includes subjects who were rebounder (confirmed viral load ≥ 50 copies/ml after being 
responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load < 50 copies/ml, either ongoing or discontinued due to lack or loss of 
efficacy).
e.g. lost to follow-up, non-compliance, withdrew consent.
¶
At week 96, the mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count was +228 × 106 cells/l in the 
rilpivirine arm and +219 × 106 cells/l in the efavirenz arm in the pooled analysis of the ECHO and 
THRIVE trials [estimated treatment difference (95% CI): 11.3 (-6.8; 29.4)].
From the week 96 pooled resistance analysis, the resistance outcome for patients with protocol defined 
virological failure, and paired genotypes (baseline and failure) is shown in table 5.

Resistance was defined as the emergence of any resistance-associated mutation at failure.
#
For those patients failing therapy with rilpivirine and who developed resistance to rilpivirine, 
cross-resistance to other approved NNRTIs (etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine) was generally seen.
Study TMC278-C204 was a randomised, active-controlled, Phase IIb trial in antiretroviral 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients consisting of 2 parts: an initial partially blinded 
dose-finding part [(rilpivirine) doses blinded] up to 96 weeks, followed by a long-term, open label 
part. In the open label part of the trial, patients originally randomised to one of the three doses of 
rilpivirine were all treated with rilpivirine 25 mg once daily in addition to a BR, once the dose for the 
Phase III studies was selected. Patients in the control arm received efavirenz 600 mg once daily in 
addition to a BR in both parts of the study. The BR consisted of 2 investigator-selected N(t)RTIs: 
zidovudine plus lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine.
Study TMC278-C204 enrolled 368 HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve adult patients who had a plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5,000 copies/ml, previously received ≤ 2 weeks of treatment with an N(t)RTI or 
protease inhibitor, had no prior use of NNRTIs and were screened for susceptibility to N(t)RTI and for 
absence of specific NNRTI resistance-associated mutations.
At 96 weeks, the proportion of patients with < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml receiving rilpivirine 25 mg 
(N=93) compared to patients receiving efavirenz (N=89) was 76% and 71%, respectively. The mean 
increase from baseline in CD4+ counts was 146 × 106 cells/l in patients receiving rilpivirine 25 mg 
and 160 × 106 cells/l in patients receiving efavirenz.
Of those patients who were responders at week 96, 74% of patients receiving rilpivirine remained with 
undetectable viral load (< 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) at week 240 compared to 81% of patients 
receiving efavirenz. There were no safety concerns identified in the week 240 analyses.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily, in combination 
with an investigator-selected BR containing two NRTIs, was evaluated in trial TMC278-C213, a 
single-arm, open-label Phase II trial in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescent
subjects weighing at least 32 kg. This analysis included 36 patients who had completed at least
48 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier.
The 36 subjects had a median age of 14.5 years (range: 12 to 17 years), and were 55.6% female, 
88.9% Black and 11.1% Asian. The median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10 copies per ml, 
and the median baseline CD4+ cell count was 414 × 106 cells/l (range: 25 to 983 × 106 cells/l).
Table 6 summarizes the week 48 and week 240 virologic outcome results for trial TMC278-C213. Six 
subjects discontinued due to virological failure up to week 48 and 3 subjects discontinued beyond 
week 48. One subject discontinued due to an adverse event at week 48, and no additional subjects 
discontinued due to adverse events in the week 240 analysis.

§
Intent-to-treat time to loss of virologic response.
Subjects achieved virologic response (two consecutive viral loads < 50 copies/ml) and maintained it through week 48 and week 240.
± Virologic failure in efficacy analysis: includes subjects who were rebounder (confirmed viral load ≥ 50 copies/ml after being 
responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load < 50 copies/ml, either ongoing or discontinued due to lack or loss 
of efficacy).
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rilpivirine in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
Pregnancy
Rilpivirine in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 19 pregnant 
women during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate 
that total exposure (AUC) to rilpivirine as a part of an antiretroviral regimen was approximately 30%
lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6-12 weeks). The virologic response was 
generally preserved throughout the study: of the 12 subjects that completed the study, 10 subjects were 
suppressed at the end of the study; in the other 2 subjects an increase in viral load was observed only 
postpartum, for at least 1 subject due to suspected suboptimal adherence. No mother to child 
transmission occurred in all 10 infants born to the mothers who completed the trial and for whom the 
HIV status was available. Rilpivirine was well tolerated during pregnancy and postpartum. There were 
no new safety findings compared with the known safety profile of rilpivirine in HIV-1 infected adults 
(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of rilpivirine have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in 
antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients 12 years of age and older. Exposure to 
rilpivirine was generally lower in HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects.
Absorption
After oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration of rilpivirine is generally achieved 
within 4-5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of EDURANT is unknown.
Effect of food on absorption
The exposure to rilpivirine was approximately 40% lower when EDURANT was taken in a fasted 
condition as compared to a normal caloric meal (533 kcal) or high-fat high-caloric meal (928 kcal). 
When EDURANT was taken with only a protein-rich nutritional drink, exposures were 50% lower 
18
than when taken with a meal. EDURANT must be taken with a meal to obtain optimal absorption. 
Taking EDURANT in fasted condition or with only a nutritional drink may result in decreased plasma 
concentrations of rilpivirine, which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of EDURANT (see 
section 4.2).
Distribution
Rilpivirine is approximately 99.7% bound to plasma proteins in vitro, primarily to albumin. The 
distribution of rilpivirine into compartments other than plasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital tract 
secretions) has not been evaluated in humans.
Biotransformation
In vitro experiments indicate that rilpivirine primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism mediated by 
the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A system.
Elimination
The terminal elimination half-life of rilpivirine is approximately 45 hours. After single dose oral 
administration of 14C-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity could be retrieved in 
faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on average 25% of the 
administered dose. Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) were detected in urine.
Additional information on special populations
Paediatric population (less than 18 years of age)
The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescent
subjects receiving EDURANT 25 mg once daily were comparable to those in treatment-naïve HIV-1
infected adults receiving EDURANT 25 mg once daily. There was no impact of body weight on 
rilpivirine pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects in trial TMC278-C213 (33 to 93 kg), similar to 
what was observed in adults.
The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in paediatric patients less than 12 years of age are under 
investigation. Dosing recommendations for paediatric patients less than 12 years of age cannot be 
made due to insufficient data (see section 4.2).
Older people
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that rilpivirine pharmacokinetics 
are not different across the age range (18 to 78 years) evaluated, with only 3 subjects aged 65 years or 
older. No dose adjustment of EDURANT is required in older patients. EDURANT should be used 
with caution in this population (see section 4.2).
Gender
No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have been observed between 
men and women.
Race
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of rilpivirine in HIV infected patients indicated that race had no 
clinically relevant effect on the exposure to rilpivirine.
Hepatic impairment
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a study comparing 8 patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A) to 8 matched controls, and 8 patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose exposure of 
rilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment. However, it may not be excluded that the pharmacologically active, 
unbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate hepatic impairment.
19
No dose adjustment is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
EDURANT has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C).
Therefore, EDURANT is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2).
Hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection had no 
clinically relevant effect on the exposure to rilpivirine.
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal 
elimination of rilpivirine is negligible. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, 
EDURANT should be used with caution, as plasma concentrations may be increased due to alteration 
of drug absorption, distribution and/or metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. In patients with 
severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, the combination of EDURANT with a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk. As rilpivirine is highly bound
to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal 
dialysis (see section 4.2).
Pregnancy and Postpartum
The exposure to total rilpivirine after intake of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral 
regimen was lower during pregnancy (similar for the 2nd and 3rd trimester) compared with postpartum 
(see table 7). The decrease in unbound (ie, active) rilpivirine pharmacokinetic parameters during 
pregnancy compared to postpartum was less pronounced than for total rilpivirine.
In women receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-
individual values for total rilpivirine Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were, respectively, 21%, 29% and 
35% lower as compared to postpartum; during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin
values were, respectively, 20%, 31% and 42% lower as compared to postpartum.

Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity
Liver toxicity associated with liver enzyme induction was observed in rodents. In dogs, 
cholestasis-like effects were noted.
Reproductive toxicology studies
Studies in animals have shown no evidence of relevant embryonic or foetal toxicity or an effect on 
reproductive function. There was no teratogenicity with rilpivirine in rats and rabbits. The exposures at 
the embryo-foetal No Observed Adverse Effects Levels (NOAELs) in rats and rabbits were 
respectively 15 and 70 times higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg 
once daily.
20
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis
Rilpivirine was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up 
to 104 weeks. At the lowest tested doses in the carcinogenicity studies, the systemic exposures (based 
on AUC) to rilpivirine were 21-fold (mice) and 3-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans at 
the recommended dose (25 mg once daily). In rats, there were no drug-related neoplasms. In mice, 
rilpivirine was positive for hepatocellular neoplasms in both males and females. The observed 
hepatocellular findings in mice may be rodent-specific.
Rilpivirine has tested negative in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system in the 
in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay and the in vitro clastogenicity mouse lymphoma assay. 
Rilpivirine did not induce chromosomal damage in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What EDURANT is and what it is used for
EDURANT contains rilpivirine that is used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
(HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTIs). EDURANT works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body.
EDURANT is used in combination with other HIV medicines to treat adolescents and adults 
12 years of age and older who are infected with HIV and who have never been treated before with 
HIV medicines.
Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.
2. What you need to know before you take EDURANT
Do not take EDURANT if you are allergic to rilpivirine or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).
Do not take EDURANT in combination with any of the following medicines as they may affect the 
way EDURANT or the other medicine works:
-
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures)
rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)
omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, (proton pump inhibitors 
that are medicines to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux disease)
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions) when taken by mouth or injected, except as a single dose treatment
products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for 
depression).
-
-
-
-
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EDURANT.
32
EDURANT is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in the 
blood. 
EDURANT has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to 
this age group, please discuss the use of EDURANT with your doctor.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
-
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including 
hepatitis B and/or C, and/or problems with your kidneys. Your doctor may evaluate how 
severe your liver or kidney disease is before deciding if you can take EDURANT.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections (for example, fever, 
chills, sweats). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic
infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the 
body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with 
no obvious symptoms.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that may cause a life-threatening irregular 
heartbeat (Torsade de Pointes).
-
-
-
Children
EDURANT is not for use in children less than 12 years of age, because it has not been sufficiently 
studied in these patients.
Other medicines and EDURANT
You must take EDURANT together with other HIV medicines. Your doctor will advise on which HIV 
medicines can be combined with EDURANT and together you will decide which combination fits 
your needs best. Follow your doctor’s instruction carefully.
Some medicines may affect the levels of EDURANT in the blood when they are taken at the same 
time as EDURANT.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
It is not recommended to combine EDURANT with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine.
The effects of EDURANT or other medicines might be influenced if you take EDURANT together 
with any of the following medicines. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections). If you take this medicine while taking 
EDURANT, please carefully read how to take EDURANT in section 3 “Instructions for proper 
use in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)”.
clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics)
cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine (H2-receptor antagonists used to treat stomach or 
intestinal ulcers or used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux). If you take these medicines, 
please carefully read how to take them in section 3 “Instructions for proper use in adults and 
adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)”.
-
-
33
-
-
-
antacids (used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach; for example, 
aluminium/magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). If you take these medicines, please 
carefully read how to take them in section 3 “Instructions for proper use in adults and 
adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)”.
methadone (used to treat narcotic withdrawal and dependence)
dabigatran etexilate (anticoagulant).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Pregnant women 
should discuss the use of EDURANT with their doctor.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Some patients may experience tiredness, dizziness or drowsiness during treatment with EDURANT. 
Do not drive or operate machinery if you feel tired, dizzy or drowsy while taking EDURANT.
EDURANT contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.
EDURANT contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
3.
How to take EDURANT
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Instructions for proper use in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)
The recommended dose of EDURANT is one tablet once a day.
EDURANT must be taken with a meal. A meal is important to get the right levels of active 
substance in your body. A nutritional drink (e.g. protein-rich) alone does not replace a meal.
There are four situations that require special attention:
1.
If you take rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections), take two tablets of 
EDURANT once a day. When you stop taking rifabutin, take one tablet of EDURANT once a 
day. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
If you take an antacid (a medicine to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach such as 
aluminium / magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). Take the antacid either at least 2 hours 
before or at least 4 hours after EDURANT (see section 2 “Other medicines and EDURANT”).
If you take an H2-receptor antagonist (medicines used to treat stomach or intestinal ulcers or 
used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux (such as cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine or 
ranitidine). Take the H2-receptor antagonist at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after 
EDURANT (see section 2 “Other medicines and EDURANT”). H2-receptor antagonists should 
not be taken in a twice a day regimen. Talk to your doctor about an alternative regimen.
If you take didanosine (a medicine to treat HIV infection), no dose adjustment is required. 
Didanosine should be administered on an empty stomach at least two hours before or at least 
four hours after EDURANT (which must be taken with a meal).

Removing the child resistant cap
The bottle comes with a child resistant cap. It can be opened by pushing the screw 
cap down while turning it anti-clockwise.
If you take more EDURANT than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. In case of overdose, you may have a headache, 
nausea, dizziness, and/or abnormal dreams.
If you forget to take EDURANT
If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take EDURANT, you must take the tablet as 
soon as possible. The EDURANT tablet must be taken with a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. 
If you notice after 12 hours, then skip that dose and take the next doses as usual.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking EDURANT, take another tablet with a meal. If you vomit 
more than 4 hours after taking EDURANT you do not need to take another tablet until your next 
regularly scheduled tablet.
Contact your doctor if uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.
Do not stop using EDURANT
HIV treatment does not cure HIV infection! Do not stop using EDURANT without talking to your 
doctor first. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking EDURANT or your other HIV medicines. 
Doing so could increase the risk of the virus developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

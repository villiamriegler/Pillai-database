SmPC, Annex 
The results obtained from a long-term follow-up extension 
in order to reflect information on the long-term 
II and PL 
study conducted in healthy adolescents of 12-15 years, 
antibody persistence and immune memory up to 15 
years after primary immunisation of adolescents, 
based on data from the Phase IV study HAB-084 EXT 
Y11-15 (An open, long-term follow-up study to 
evaluate long-term antibody persistence and immune 
memory between 11 and 15 years after the primary 
study HAB-084). The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in 
line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
tested 15 years after the primary vaccination with Ambirix, 
showed anti-HAV seropositivity rates of 100% and anti-HBs 
seroprotection rates of 81.1%. These data show the long-
term persistence of immune memory for both hepatitis A 
and B vaccination with Ambirix, suggesting a sustained 
long term protection.

SmPC, 
Following receipt of customers’ complaints with regards to 
improve the re-suspension instructions following 
receipt of customers’ complaints with regards to 
unusual vaccine appearance and based on user 
testing results. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in 
line with the latest QRD template version 9.1, to 
include some corrections and to align the wording 
across combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines 
(i.e. Twinrix Adult, Twinrix Paediatric and Ambirix). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Labelling and 
‘unusual vaccine appearance’ for hepatitis A and B vaccines 
PL 
often described as ‘cloudy vaccine’ or ‘particles in vaccine’, 
the MAH initiated an investigation into these complaints. 
The aluminium salt used as adjuvant can settle during 
storage and form an insoluble pellet which can break into 
particles if not sufficiently re-suspended prior to 
administration of the vaccine. The MAH therefore proposed 
to improve the re-suspension instructions intended for 
health care professionals, based on the results of a user 
testing, in order to obtain a uniform hazy white suspension 
prior to administration.

Although the results of the retesting with the anti-HBs CLIA 
assay (CLIA) data for the persistence of the anti-HBs

showed that the percentage of subjects having an anti-HBs 
antibody response ten years after primary 
vaccination. Furthermore, the MAH took this 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 9.0. Finally, minor editorial 
amendments are made throughout the PI. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

and PL 
antibody concentration > 10mIU/ml tends to be lower than 
with the initial ELISA test (77.3% versus 81.7%), this 
4.4% difference observed at Year 10 post-primary 
vaccination is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance, 
as an anamnestic response was obtained in all subjects 
following a challenge dose. The persistence of antibody 10 
years after the primary vaccination is still demonstrated for 
the majority of subjects and the immunogenicity profile is 
considered unchanged.

by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ambirix in 
non-immune children and adolescents from 1 year up to

and hepatitis B infection, remains favourable and therefore 
recommends the renewal of the marketing authorisation

This was an application for a group of variations 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to

the available safety data. The PL was proposed to be 
updated in accordance. In addition, the company 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the PL of Pumarix, Ambirix, 
safety database performed by the MAH, the CHMP 
recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope 
to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. 
The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred 
around the age of 15 years, with females having more than 
twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with 
secondary injuries were reported most frequently in 
children and adolescents.  
Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it 
was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an 
undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as 
such events can result in injury, and may not have

addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the PL.

To update section 4.2 "Posology and method of 
administration" and section 5.1 "Pharmacodynamic 
properties" of the SmPC with data from four long-
term immune persistence studies: HAB-137 and 
HAB-152 which were conducted in children 1 to 11 
years old and HAB-159 and HAB-157 which were 
conducted in adolescents 12 to 15 years old. 
data, the Product Information was updated  to include 
adverse event terms from a cumulative review of Ambirix 
PMS data (Syncope, Anaphylaxis/allergic reactions, 
localised Hypoaesthesia) and adverse event terms 
previously included in the Twinrix Adult SmPC 
(Angioneurotic oedema, Paralysis, Neuritis, Neuropathy, 
Lichen planus, Arthritis, Muscular weakness). 
In addition, this variation also updated section 4.9 of the 
Ambirix SmPC to harmonise the information on overdose 
with that of the Twinrix Adult SmPC to remove wording 
referring to thiomersal containing formulations from 
sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Ambirix SmPC to harmonise 
with the SmPCs for Fendrix and Twinrix. The MAH made 
also minor changes to wording and format to comply with 
the updated Guideline on SmPC, as well as the QRD 
template.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the PL to reflect that recommendations should be 
addressed not only to children/adolescents but also 
to their adult guardians.

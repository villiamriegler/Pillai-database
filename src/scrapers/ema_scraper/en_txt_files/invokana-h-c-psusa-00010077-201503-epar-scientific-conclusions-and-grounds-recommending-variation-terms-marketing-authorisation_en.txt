Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for canagliflozin, metformin, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations 
Following a request from PRAC, the MAH conducted a search of the clinical trial database identified 69 
cases of serious adverse events of renal failure in 65 subjects (17 on canagliflozin 100 mg, 13 on 
canagliflozin 300 mg, 16 on comparator and 19 still on blinded treatment). Additionally, an analysis 
of post-marketing data for renal failure and renal impairment events included 382 serious cases 
involving the use of canagliflozin, and 1 serious case involving the use of canagliflozin/metformin. For 
completeness, 117 non-serious cases for canagliflozin and 2 non-serious cases for 
canagliflozin/metformin were also reviewed. Although this events occurred via volume depletion in 
most of the cases other mechanisms may be involved. Hence, the PRAC agreed with the MAH’s 
proposal to include information on these events in the product information. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding canagliflozin and canaglifozin/metformin, the PRAC 
considered that changes to the Product Information of medicinal products containing canagliflozin and 
canaglifozin/metformin were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for canagliflozin, metformin the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing canagliflozin, metformin is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

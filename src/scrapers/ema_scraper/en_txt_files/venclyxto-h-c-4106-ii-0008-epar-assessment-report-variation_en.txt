2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Venetoclax is a selective, orally available, small molecule inhibitor designed to bind competitively to B-
cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), thereby liberating pro-apoptotic proteins to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells.  
Aberrant expression of BCL-2 is common in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and CLL cells typically 
rely on BCL-2 for survival. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717199/2018  
Page 7/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood for the 
duration of at least 3 months. It is the most common form of adult leukaemia in the Western world, 
representing about 30% of leukaemias, with higher incidences in North America and Europe than in 
Asia, with an incidence of 4 per 100,000 persons per year. In Europe, the age-standardised CLL 
incidence rate from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink was 6.2/100,000 person 
years. The median age of diagnosis in the EU is 72 years and only 10% of patients are less than 55 
years old. The current WHO classification system recognizes and groups CLL and small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL) as the same biological entity, with CLL clinically manifesting primarily in bone marrow 
and peripheral blood, and SLL primarily manifesting in the lymph nodes.  
Current treatments for CLL are not curative. Fewer patients obtain responses with each subsequent 
regimen, and subjects become increasingly resistant to available therapy. Patients who relapse after a 
disease-free period of over 1 year (2-3 years for chemoimmunotherapy) are considered treatment 
sensitive and may be candidates for treatment reinitiation. Patients who relapse after a shorter 
interval, or are refractory to first-line treatment, present a more challenging group, particularly those 
who are older, have comorbid conditions, and/or harbour high-risk cytogenic abnormalities. A 
retrospective analysis of patients in the German CLL8 trial found that overall survival after the start of 
salvage treatment among patients whose disease had progressed within 2 years after the end of 
chemoimmunotherapy was about 2 years, comparable to that of truly refractory patients. In the 
EUROCARE-5 registry, the survival rate for patients with CLL at 5 years post diagnosis was 69.0%. 
Patients with a genetic mutation with 17p del or a mutation of the tumour suppressor gene TP53 have 
a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS) of 2 to 5 years. Approximately 5% to 10% of 
patients with early stage CLL have a 17p del and/or TP53 mutation; this rate increases with treatment 
lines up to 40% in advanced refractory CLL. Approximately 80% of CLL patients with a 17p del also 
have a mutation in TP53; sole TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p del have been reported to occur 
in approximately 4% to 5% of patients. 
The monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, is currently approved in the EU in the treatment of CLL in the 
relapsed or refractory setting as a single agent. The combination of the monoclonal antibody rituximab 
with chemotherapy (eg, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) (FCR regimen) is approved in the EU for 
use in this setting. Marketing authorization for alemtuzumab, which had been indicated for the 
treatment of CLL in patients for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate, was 
withdrawn in the EU in August 2012. 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment option with the 
potential to cure CLL; however most patients are not fit for HSCT and the benefits must be weighed 
against the risks for each patient. Historically, the prognosis for 17p del CLL patients has been poor 
due to the limited efficacy of immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy-based regimens.  A median 
progression free survival (PFS) of 14 months has been reported in first-line 17p deletion patients and 6 
to 7 months in relapsed/refractory (R/R) 17p del patients; median OS was approximately 24 months. 
Recent introduction of targeted therapy, such as BCR inhibitors (BCRi), has improved the treatment 
options for CLL patients with the 17p del or TP53 mutation.  Ibrutinib demonstrates independent 
review committee (IRC) assessed objective remission rate (ORR) of 48% to 65% (investigator 
assessed ORR of 83% to 86%) and idelalisib/rituximab demonstrates IRC assessed ORR of 85%. In 
2014, Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and Zydelig (idelalisib) in combination with rituximab were approved for 
treatment of CLL patients that have received at least one prior therapy and first-line treatment in the 
presence of 17p del or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.  
Venclyxto in monotherapy is currently conditionally licensed for the treatment of CLL:

in the presence of 17 p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or 
have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or 
in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both 
chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. 
This is an extension of Indication to include: “Venclyxto in combination with rituximab for the 
treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one 
prior therapy”. 
Venclyxto is orally administered presented as film coated tablets proposed as a starting dose of 20 mg 
once daily for 7 days, to be gradually increased over a period of 5 weeks up to the recommended daily 
dose of 400 mg.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Venetoclax observed PK 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements were taken in both study M13-365 and study GO28667. The PK 
samples were collected after the venetoclax dose ramp-up schedule. The pre-dose sample for Cycle 1 
was collected prior to the first dose of rituximab, whereas all subsequent PK samples were collected 
after initiating rituximab therapy. A comparison of cycle 1 and cycle 4 pre-dose steady-state mean 
venetoclax plasma concentration is shown in Table 1.

Concentrations (μg/mL) Following a 400 mg Dose of Venetoclax 
PopPK venetoclax 
PK parameters of venetoclax were characterized using a popPK analysis. The popPK analysis assessed 
whether a previous popPK model structure for venetoclax was able to describe PK of venetoclax in 
combination with Rituximab in study GO28667. All patients in Arm A (venetoclax + rituximab) in study 
GO28667 with at least one quantifiable plasma venetoclax concentration value by the pharmacokinetic 
samples analysis data cut-off date (2/24/2017) were included in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. The analysis included 600 quantifiable venetoclax plasma samples from 182 patients 
following 400 mg daily dose of venetoclax.  
The data were described by the two-compartment population PK model with first-order absorption and 
elimination. The final model structure was identical to the final model of the previous analysis, with an 
additional effect of geographical region on apparent clearance. Shrinkage of the inter-individual 
random effects was moderate to high (31-54%). Rituximab co-administration was estimated to 
increase CL/F by 7% (95% CI: 2% – 12%). Patients from Central and Eastern Europe and Asia had 
apparent clearance 30% (95% CI: 21% – 39%) lower and steady state exposure approximately 43% 
higher compared to patients from other regions.

Figure 1: Prediction-Corrected Visual Predictive Check, Model 027 (Final Model) 
Patients from Central and Eastern Europe and Asia had apparent clearance 30% lower and steady 
state exposure approximately 43% higher compared to patients from other regions. Only 4 patients 
were from Asia, thus no conclusion on PK differences for patients from the Asian region can be drawn.  
60 patients were from central/eastern Europe. However it does not appear that a link for this 
geographical region to race can be made that would explain the difference in clearance. In the popPK 
Assessment report

report 176 patients were assigned race white while 6 patients were assigned as Asian. No other races 
were reported. 
Both the popPK and the observed data suggest that there is no DDI between venetoclax and 
rituximab. The similarity in parameter estimates between the previous and the updated popPK models 
show that PK of venetoclax is similar in study GO28667 compared to what has previously been 
reported.  
Rituximab PK 
PK samples for rituximab were not collected in study GO28667 but were collected in study M13-365. 
The mean (SD) for serum concentration of rituximab for cohorts 3 through 6 obtained at the monthly 
combination visits prior to and immediately after the infusion are presented in Figure 2. Different 
doses of venetoclax from Cohorts 3 through 6 (200, 300, 400 and 600 mg) did not have any 
statistically significant impact on rituximab mean concentrations prior to and immediately after infusion 
at each combination therapy visit (p-value < 0.05). Steady-state (Month 6) mean rituximab trough 
concentrations ranged from 94.9 - 141 μg/mL, depending on cohort. These are similar to trough values 
reported in the literature with the same rituximab dosing regimen in R/R CLL patients, with mean 
rituximab trough concentrations at Month 6 of around 100 μg/mL (Li et al., J Clin Pharmacol. 2012). 
Mean rituximab trough concentrations at the early cycles, such as at Month 3, are approximately 2 to 3 
-fold higher than that reported in the literature, likely due to early reduction of B-cells by venetoclax.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling  
The post-hoc estimates of venetoclax PK parameters from the final population PK model and the 
relevant PK covariates for each subject were used to estimate individual exposure measures for each 
patient. For subjects who did not have evaluable PK data and were not included in the population PK 
analysis, the PK parameters were imputed using the population estimates and the individual subject's 
covariate values.  
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
The exposure-efficacy analysis utilized 194 patients administered venetoclax from V+R arm of Study 
GO28667. The exposure-efficacy analysis of venetoclax efficacy parameters showed no statistically 
significant or clinically meaningful relationships with venetoclax exposure, supporting the current QD 
400 mg regimen of venetoclax in combination with rituximab in R/R CLL patients. 
Exposure-safety analysis 
The main exposure-safety analysis, which only analyzed the AE data after the end of the ramp-up 
phase, utilized 191 patients from V+R arm of Study GO28667 and 48 patients from Study M13-365. 
The logistic regression analyses in patients from studies M13-365 and GO28667 indicated that there 
were no statistically significant associations between venetoclax exposure and probability of treatment-
emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and treatmentemergent Grade ≥ 3 infections. The pooled exposure-
safety analysis suggested no statistically significant improvement in the safety profile would be 
expected with lower venetoclax exposure over the tested venetoclax dose range (200 - 600 mg QD). 
Venetoclax co administration did not appear to impact the delivery of rituximab, and patients with 
higher venetoclax exposure showed similar tolerability of the study treatment compared to patients 
with lower venetoclax exposure. There was no apparent correlation between venetoclax exposure and 
venetoclax or rituximab dose intensity. Overall, the exposure safety/tolerability parameters showed no 
statistically significant or clinically meaningful relationships with venetoclax exposure, supporting the 
current QD 400 mg regimen of venetoclax in combination with rituximab in R/R CLL patients. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The observed mean steady state pre-dose concentration for venetoclax at cycle 1 (venetoclax alone) 
and cycle 4 (venetoclax + rituximab) are all similar in both the M13-365 and the GO28667 studies. 
This suggests that there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between venetoclax and rituximab affecting 
venetoclax PK. This is further supported by the popPK analysis. 
The previous popPK model structure, used as a starting point here, has previously been assessed and 
deemed adequate. The pcVPC for the updated model show that the model structure is adequate also 
for the new data from the GO28667 study. The parameter estimates between the previous model and 
the updated model are small. Shrinkage was however relatively high.  
Rituximab co-administration was estimated to increase CL/F by 7% which can be considered negligible. 
Rituximab exposures at steady state did not appear to be affected by different doses of venetoclax in 
study M13-365. Mean rituximab trough concentrations at the early cycles were a 2 to 3 -fold higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717199/2018  
Page 13/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than that reported in the literature. The explanation that this is likely due to early reduction of B-cells 
by venetoclax is accepted. Mean concentrations of rituximab at early cycles are still lower than at 
steady state, thus this increased exposure at early cycles is not expected to provide any safety 
concerns. 
The reason for lower clearance patients in Central/Eastern Europe is not known and could be a chance 
finding. Further, the venetoclax dose is titrated up for 5 weeks and a table for dose modifications due 
to toxicity is provided in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Thus, it does not appear that any changes in 
posology for patients in Central/Eastern Europe are warranted. 
Only one dosing regimen was used in study GO28667 and thus, the usefulness of the exposure-
efficacy analysis is limited. Shrinkage from the popPK was relatively high (31-54%) indicating difficulty 
for the model to estimate individual parameters, further limiting the value of the exposure-efficacy 
analysis.  
As expected, the exposure-response analysis showed no significant relationships with venetoclax 
exposure.  
The information from the exposure-response analyses are of limited value but the venetoclax dosing 
regimen in combination with rituximab can be supported based on the clinical efficacy data (see 
Clinical Efficacy section).  
Only one dosing regimen was used in study GO28667. For the exposure-safety analyses, data from 
study M13-365 was also included.  While the data from M13-365 was for only around 50 patients, the 
usefulness of exposure-safety analyses could have been higher than for the exposure-efficacy since 
several doses were studied in M13-365. For subjects who did not have evaluable PK data and were not 
included in the population PK analysis, the primary PK parameters were imputed using the population 
estimates and the individual subject's covariate values. Since data from M13-365 was not included in 
the popPK model, the exposures for patients in M13-365 is not adequately described by the applicants 
approach.  In addition, high shrinkage from the popPK model is still an issue further limiting the 
usefulness of the exposure-safety analysis. 
The exposure safety/tolerability parameters showed no statistically significant or clinically meaningful 
relationships with venetoclax exposure. While the exposure-safety has several limitations it suggested 
that no statistically significant improvement in the safety profile would be expected with lower 
venetoclax exposure over the tested venetoclax dose range. This would suggest that the approved 400 
mg dosing regimen of venetoclaxm which was chosen for study GO28667 was appropriate from an 
exposure-safety standpoint. (see also Clinical Safety section). 
The usefulness of the conducted exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety modeling analyses are limited 
but using the approved doses of venetoclax and rituximab appear appropriate. This is supported by the 
pharmacokinetics, no clinically relevant DDI between venetoclax and rituximab was found in the 
observed data or in the popPK analysis. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology aspects have been adequately studied. No relevant changes are needed in 
section 5.2 in the SmPC.

199) in Combination with Rituximab in Subjects with Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. 
First subject study visit 25 July 2012, ongoing, data cut off 01 July 2016. 
The primary objectives of this study were to assess the safety profile, determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD), and establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) of venetoclax when 
administered in combination with rituximab in subjects with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL). 
Ramp up dosing of venetoclax was modified to 20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg (or additional lead-in 
steps to designated cohort dose). After a week at the designated cohort dose of venetoclax, the 
combination of venetoclax and rituximab was started. 
Up to 50 subjects with relapsed CLL or SLL were planned. As of the data cutoff for this interim CSR, 49 
subjects have been treated with at least 1 dose of venetoclax and are included in the safety 
population, including 8 subjects in the expanded safety cohort. 
For the combination period, rituximab was administered monthly on Day 1 of Months 1 to 6 for an 
overall duration of approximately 6 months. After discontinuation of rituximab, subjects were allowed 
to receive venetoclax monotherapy for up to 4 years following the date of the last subject enrolled. 
Efficacy Results: 
All efficacy analyses were exploratory. The 49 subjects enrolled in the study were included across 5 
dose-escalating cohorts, in addition to 1 safety expansion cohort at the RPTD and schedule. The 
efficacy results are summarized as follows: Overall, the majority of subjects (42 [85.7%]) achieved 
investigator assessed objective response, 25/49 (51.0%) subjects achieved CR or CRi.  
Safety Results:  
Analysis of overall safety in Study M13-365 at doses from 200 to 600 mg venetoclax did not 
convincingly demonstrate a relationship between dose and safety. Incidences of treatment emergent 
adverse events in the Blood and Lymphatic Disorders, Gastrointestinal Disorders, General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions, Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders, Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue 
Disorders, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders, and Investigations SOCs and grade 3 or 4 
adverse events overall were numerically lowest in the 400 mg dose group compared to total subjects. 
The selection of 400 mg as the dose to explore further in the safety expansion portion of this study 
(Cohort 6) was based on the balance of safety and efficacy data.

for “confirmation).  
•  Risk status: High risk (17p del, no response to first line therapy, relapse within 12 month after 
chemotherapy, 24 month after chemo-immuno-therapy). Low risk: complementary set.  
•  Region: US/Canada, Australia/New/Zealand, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Asia, 
Latin America. 
• 
Planned sample size 370 individuals randomized 1:1. Final analysis at 186 investigator 
assessed PFS events, one interim analysis at 140 events, i.e. 38% of events in the long run 
(assuming no cure, relative survival).  
Sample size 
The  primary  endpoint  of  PFS  was  used  to  determine  the  sample  size  for  the  study  based  on  the 
following assumptions: Two-sided log-rank test at the 0.05 level of significance, 80% power to detect 
a  hazard  ratio  (HR)  for  venetoclax  +  R  versus  BR  of  0.66,  corresponding  to  an  approximate  median 
improvement  of  15.2  months  to  23  months  (34%  reduction  in  risk  of  a  PFS  event),  Exponential 
distribution  of  PFS,  an  annual  dropout  rate  of  5%,  One  interim  analysis  (IA)  for  efficacy  at 
approximately  75%  of  total  investigator-  assessed  PFS  events  (approximately  140  investigator-
assessed PFS events). With these assumptions, 186 investigator-assessed PFS events were required to 
achieve 80% power for the primary analysis of PFS in all patients. It is planned to enroll 370 patients 
across  the  two  arms  with  1:1  randomization  ratio.  Sample  size  calculations  were  performed  with 
Insightful S+ Seq Trial S 2.0.6. 
Randomisation 
Block stratified randomization procedure using an interactive voice/web based system was used. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label.

Statistical methods 
Analysis  sets.  The  primary  analysis  of  efficacy  was  based  on  the  set  of  all  randomized  patients  (cf 
intention-to-treat  population).  The  primary  analysis  of  safety  was  based  on  the  set  of  all  treated 
patients, who received at least one dose of the study treatment. 
Planned interim analysis. One IA was planned during the conduct of the study to assess the efficacy of 
V+R  combination  treatment  compared  with  B+R  treatment,  and  to  allow  for  release  of  the  results 
earlier  than  the  planned  final  analysis  in  case  of  significant  differences.  The  IA  is  performed  when 
approximately 140 investigator-assessed PFS events have occurred in both treatment arms combined 
(75%  of  the  186  events  required  for  the  final  primary  efficacy  analysis  is  available).  The  stopping 
boundary  follows  a  unified  family  with  parameter  P=2  (Kittelson  and  Emerson  1999).  Based  on  140 
events, the duration of PFS will be tested at the IA, which corresponds to approximately a 2-sided p-
value of 2 * 0.0013 = 0.0026.  
Primary  efficacy  endpoint  analysis.  A  two-sided  stratified  (by  17p  deletion  status,  risk  status  and 
geographic  region)  log-rank  test  adjusted  for  interim  analysis;  a  two  sided  unstratified  log-rank  test 
was performed to confirm the primary analysis. Median PFS and 95% confidence limits were estimated 
using Kaplan-Meier methodology.  
The primary endpoint will be tested at the IA with 140 events, which corresponds to approximately a 
2-sided  p-value  of  2  *  0.0013  =  0.0026.  In  case  the  observed  number  of  events  is  not  exactly  140, 
the boundaries will be updated to reflect the number of events based on investigator assessment and 
IRC assessment, respectively. 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoint  analysis.  To  adjust  for  multiple  testing  of  the  key  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints, a fixed sequence hierarchical testing procedure was used for specific key efficacy endpoints. 
Formal  statistical  testing  of  response  rates  between  the  two  arms  was  performed  at  the  two-sided 
significance  level  of  0.05  using  a  stratified  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test.  Time-to-event 
endpoints such as OS, EFS, and TTNT were analyzed using the same statistical methods described for 
the primary analysis of PFS. Additional secondary endpoints were not tested formally. 
Secondary endpoints were tested following a multiple testing procedure based on hierarchical testing. 
To adjust for multiple testing of key secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed sequence testing procedure 
was used (Westfall and Krishen 2001). The following endpoints were tested in the following order: 1) 
IRC-assessed CR rate, 2) IRC-assessed best ORR, 3) OS. 
If  the  study  meets  its  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  prolonged  PFS  in  the  treatment  arm  (V+R)  in  all 
randomized patients, then a formal statistical test of IRC-assessed CR rate between the two arms will 
be performed at the two-sided significance level of 0.05 by using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH)  test  with  stratification  factors.  If  the  study  does  not  meet  its  primary  endpoint,  then  this  test 
will not be performed. The IRC-assessed best ORR will only be tested by the same stratified CMH test 
once  the  null  hypothesis  for  IRC-assessed  CR  rate  in  all  randomized  patients  has  been  rejected  at  a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
If the null hypothesis for IRC-assessed best ORR has been rejected at a two-sided significance level of 
0.05, the duration of OS will be analyzed at a nominal alpha spend of 0.0001. Approximately 3 years 
after the last patient is enrolled, OS will be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.0499.

Recruitment 
Study period: February 2014 (first patient screened) to May 2017 (cut-off for interim analysis) 
Study centres: 20 countries (14 EU), 109 centres. 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 59.9% (233/389) of patients (67.0% [130/194] in the VR arm and 52.8% [103/195] in the 
BR arm) had at least one major protocol deviation reported. The most common deviations (reported 
for 66.0% of patients in the VR arm and 50.3% of patients in the BR arm) were procedural deviations, 
the majority of which were missing individual laboratory assessments at a single response assessment. 
None of the major deviations were likely to have an impact on study outcomes.   
Baseline data 
The median age was 65 years, and about 14% were older than 75, i.e. rather typical for CLL studies 
with moderately intensive therapies. As expected there was a dominance of males, about 3/4. About 
half were considered “high risk” and close to 20% had del 17p. About 1/3 enrolled in Western Europe 
and 1/3 in Central and Eastern Europe.

At an updated efficacy analysis with all patients off treatment (data cut-off date 8 May 2018 and 
median follow-up of 36 months) the 36-month PFS estimate in the venetoclax + rituximab arm was 
71.4% [95% CI: 64.8, 78.1] and in the bendamustine + rituximab arm was 15.2% [95% CI: 9.1, 21].

At 6 months, the VR arm had 8 PFS events compared with 14 PFS events in the BR arm. Also, the BR 
arm had 18 patients censored within the first six months compared with only one patient censored in 
the VR arm. Per medical monitor review, the 18 patients censored in the BR arm included 14 who 
dropped out from the study early and 4 patients who did not have adequate response assessment 
beyond 6 months.

Efficacy results for the pre-specified primary analysis (data cut-off date 8 May 2017) were also 
assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating a statistically significant 81% 
reduction in the risk of progression or death for patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab (hazard 
ratio: 0.19 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.28]; P<0.0001). Additional efficacy results for the pre-specified primary

Minimal Residual Disease 
Peripheral blood MRD response was assessed using iwCLL recommended ASO-PCR and flow cytometry 
for all patients and across serial timepoints. MRD was considered negative if the result was less than 
one CLL cell in 10000 leukocytes (MRD value <0.0001, 10-4). 
For both ASO-PCR and flow cytometry methods, only samples that had a limit of detection (LOD) below 
10-4 were considered for MRD determination. In addition, for flow cytometry, samples were required 
to have a minimum of 200,000 leukocytes assessed, which adhered to the prior reporting conventions 
for MRD flow cytometry data in clinical trials. 
Unlike peripheral blood MRD assessments that were performed serially throughout the study, MRD 
assessments in bone marrow were only required for responders (CR or PR) at the end of combination 
treatment response visit or at any other point during the study that a patient became a responder. A 
total of 115/389 patients [29.6%] had post baseline BM samples available for MRD assessment 
(74/194 patients [38.1%] in the VR arm and 41/195 patients [21.0%] in the BR arm). 
Comparison of MRD-negativity between the two arms in peripheral blood at the end of the combination 
treatment response (EOCTR) visit was a secondary endpoint for this study. 
Table 8: MRD-Negativity (Peripheral Blood) at the End of Combination Treatment Visit – ITT 
Population (data cut-off date 8 May 2017) 
The MRD-negativity rate in peripheral blood among investigator-assessed complete responders 
(CR/CRi) was 94.2% (49/52 patients) in the VR arm compared with 31.3% (5/16 patients) in the BR 
arm; and among investigator-assessed partial responders (nPR/PR) was 86.0% (111/129 patients) in 
the VR arm compared with 32.8% (38/116 patients) in the BR arm.  
Concordance between the MRD status in peripheral blood and in bone marrow was 84.3% based on 
108 pairs of post-baseline samples across both arms; 48 out of 60 (80.0%) patients that had been

out of 53 (90.6%) patients that measured MRD negative in bone marrow also measured negative in 
blood.

2.4.3.   Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A randomised (1:1), multicenter, open-label phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
Venclyxto + rituximab versus BR in patients with previously treated CLL. Patients in the Venclyxto + 
rituximab arm completed the Venclyxto 5-week dose-titration schedule and then received 400 mg once 
daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab in the absence of disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Rituximab was initiated after the 5-week dose-titration schedule at 375 mg/m2 
for Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 for Cycles 2-6. Each cycle was 28 days. Patients randomised to BR received 
bendamustine at 70 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 for 6 cycles and rituximab as described above. 
The overall study design was accepted by the SAWP/CHMP: Bendamustin + rituximab versus 
venetoclax + rituximab for six cycles followed by monotherapy with venetoclax until PD with PFS as 
primary endpoint – highlighting that the benefit of continuing ABT-199 until progression without a 
placebo control will not only lead to results that are non-interpretable as regards the benefit of ABT-
199 “maintenance” treatment, but also to events of progression on-therapy of ABT-199, in contrast to 
the reference arm where most progression events will occur off-therapy. Also, the MAH was advised to 
avoid cross-over until informative survival data are available.   
Changes/deviations from advice/planned design were: Venetoclax was to be administered for a total of 
6 + 18 months not until PD. An interim analysis was undertaken at about 35% of events of PFS in the 
long run (assuming no cure). The difference between events of progression on and off therapy was not 
addressed. 
A follow-up advice was requested and important and accepted changes included an interim analysis to 
be conducted “if the number of investigator assessed events of PFS is less than 160 as of 12 months 
after the enrolment of the last patient. Further time to progression was changed to total duration of 
therapy 12 months. The possibility of cross-over at time of progression was no longer optional. 
Median age was 65 years (range: 22 to 85); 74% were male, and 97% were white. Median time since 
diagnosis was 6.7 years (range: 0.3 to 29.5). Median prior lines of therapy was 1 (range: 1 to 5); and 
included alkylating agents (94%), anti-CD20 antibodies (77%), B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors 
(2%) and prior purine analogs (81%, including 55% FCR). At baseline, 46.6% of patients had one or 
more nodes ≥5 cm, and 67.6% had ALC ≥25 x 109/l. A 17p deletion was detected in 26.9% of 
patients, TP53 mutations in 26.3%, 11q deletion in 36.5%, and unmutated IgVH gene in 68.3%. 
Median follow-up time for primary analysis was 23.8 months (range: 0.0 to 37.4 months). 
Enrolled patients with at least one prior adequate treatment regimen (according to clinical guidelines) 
represent a rather heterogeneous population: median (and mean) time from diagnosis was about 7 
years, but the majority of patients had been treated with only one prior regimen. It should be noticed, 
however, that diagnosis does not imply need for therapy. On the other hand, more than 50% of 
patients were considered “high risk” and non-adjusted beta 2 microglobulin was above 3.5 mg/dl in 
close to 70% of patients. Subgroup analysis in terms of PFS, indicate no important relationship 
between prognosis and HR for PFS, but data may be misleading due to the low event rate in the VR 
arm. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by investigators using the International Workshop for 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group 
(NCI-WG) guidelines (2008).

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results for PFS at the time of pre-specified primary interim analysis (data cut-off date 8 May 
2017) showed an event rate of  16.5% of the VR combination as compared to 58.5% of the BR 
combination, with an improvement of the PFS  of HR 0.17 (0.11, 0.25). At an updated efficacy analysis 
with all patients off treatment (data cut-off date 8 May 2018 and median follow-up of 36 months) the 
36-month PFS estimate in the venetoclax + rituximab arm was 71.4% [95% CI: 64.8, 78.1] and in the 
bendamustine + rituximab arm was 15.2% [95% CI: 9.1, 21]. 
Efficacy results for the pre-specified primary analysis (data cut-off date 8 May 2017) were also 
assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating a statistically significant 81% 
reduction in the risk of progression or death for patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab (hazard 
ratio: 0.19 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.28]; P<0.0001). Median DOR was not reached with median follow up of 
approximately 23.8 months. 
In total, 130 patients in the venetoclax + rituximab arm completed 2 years of venetoclax treatment 
without progression. Of the 130 patients, 92 patients completed the 6-month post treatment follow-up 
visit. The estimated PFS rate at 6 months post treatment was 92%. 
The observed PFS benefit of venetoclax + rituximab  compared with bendamustine + rituximab was 
consistently observed across all subgroups of patients evaluated, including age (< 65, ≥ 65 years and 
< 75, ≥ 75 years), prior lines of therapy (1, >1), bulky disease (< 5 cm, ≥ 5 cm), 17p deletion, 11q 
deletion, TP53 mutation, IgVH mutation, and refractory versus relapse to most recent therapy. 
In terms of response rate (IRC by convention, no confirmation required, RECIST 1.1), CR rate is 
borderline 8% vs. 4% (p=0.08). Of note, in the investigator analysis, CR rates are much higher 27% 
vs. 8% (p<0.0008). This discrepancy was most likely due to the assessment of borderline lymph 
nodes. MRD negativity at end of dual therapy also favoured the venetoclax arm. According to the 
analysis plan, ORR should be assessed only if CR is positive: ORR 92% vs. 72% (p<0.0001). MRD data 
may be used to bridge between the validity of IRC and investigator assessment of CR.   
Formally PFS (primary endpoint) was highly significant and convincing, HR 0.17 (p< 0.0001). The 
event rate in the venetoclax arm was only 17%. Furthermore there were two steps in the PFS curves: 
in the BR arm at about 6 months and in the VT arm at about 2 years, i.e. at time of stopping therapy. 
In the control arm, PFS is likely to be sufficiently stable, event rate 58% and long follow-up off 
therapy. The pattern of recurrence in the venetoclax arm is not possible to estimate.  
In the updated cutoff of May 2018, altogether 61 patients provided PFS data at 36 months, 12 months 
after stopping venetoclax. Based on the shapes of the time to event curves it appears possible to 
conclude that the event rate with respect to progressive disease is not worse, if not better, in the VR 
arm after end of venetoclax than in the BR arm after month 24.  
As a concequence, it also appears possible to conclude that “truncated” time without therapy is longer 
than 18 months (24 – 6 months), meaning that time without therapy when data become mure mature 
is highly likely to be longer in the VT arm compared with the BT arm. At the updated analysis, a total 
of 61 randomized patients had died; 22/194 patients (11.3%) in the V+R arm and 39/195 patients 
(20.0%) in the BR arm with an exploratory HR of 0.5 (0.3; 0.85).  
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been revised to include information on the results of the MURANO trial.  
The recommended dose of venetoclax in combination with rituximab is 400 mg once daily. Rituximab 
should be adminstered after the patient has completed the dose-titration schedule and has received 
Assessment report

the recommended daily dose of 400 mg venetoclax for 7 days. Venetoclax should be taken for 24 
months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated with relevant 
posology information on the combination with rituximab. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In overall the efficacy of venetoclax in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy has been 
demonstrated. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
•  Submission of the final CSR of the MURANO study including updated efficacy data. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of Venclyxto, as reflected in the current SPC, is based on pooled, single-arm data of 
296 patients with treatment experienced CLL treated with venetoclax 400 mg monotherapy once daily.  
The most serious adverse reaction was tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). The most commonly occurring 
adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade in patients receiving Venclyxto monotherapy were 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
fatigue, hyperphosphataemia, vomiting, and constipation. The most frequently reported serious 
adverse reactions (≥2%) were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and TLS. 
Based on this experience, AEs of special interest included:

Tumour lysis syndrome: Six cases (3%) of TLS were reported in the V+R arm of MURANO, in one 
case due to a high starting dose, 100 mg instead of 20 mg.  All events occurred during the venetoclax 
ramp-up period and resolved within 2 days.  All 6 patients reached the recommended dose of 400 mg. 
In addition there were two clinical cases not meeting the Howard criteria (laboratory), 1 case in each 
arm of the study (BR and V+R).  No clinical TLS cases were reported in the V+R arm under the current 
prophylactic and monitoring measures.   
Only based on Howard criteria, there were an additional 5 patients in the V+R arm with TLS, but 
according to the investigator not clinically relevant and not reported as AE. Three of the 5 patients 
were receiving the former measures for TLS prophylaxis.  Four of the 5 patients had abnormal single or 
multiple laboratory values at baseline, prior to starting venetoclax treatment. 
There were two cases of TLS in the BR arm. 
Grade 3 or higher events of infections or serious infections: These events were reported in 
similar frequencies in the VT and BR arms, pneumonia being the most common serious event (about 
8%).  
There were 4 fatal events in the VR arm, thereof 2 at time of disease transformation (Richter) and 4 in 
the BR group. In the BR group there were two fatalities due to opportunistic infections (Listeria, 
Scedosporium).

Richter transformation: In the MURANO study there were 6 cases of transformation in the VR arm 
(DLBCL 5, Hodgkin 1) and 5 in the BR arm (DLBCL 3, Non-B cell lymphoma 1, transformation NUD 1). 
Drug induced liver injury: No case fulfilling the criteria for DILI was identified in the VR arm 
(MURANO). 
Hy’s law: Two cases in the BR arm (MURANO)  
Grade ≥3 Infusion-related Reactions: Overall, 6/194 patients (3.1%) in the V+R arm experienced 
7 Grade ≥ 3 IRRs and 18/188 patients (9.6%) in the BR arm experienced 22 Grade ≥ 3 IRRs. The 
majority of these were Grade 3 in severity (7/7 events in the V+R arm; 21/22 events in the BR arm). 
One Grade 4 infusion related reaction was reported in the BR arm. There were no Grade 5 IRRs.

In the VR arm, 1 patient experienced a serious Grade ≥3 infusion related reaction. The event resolved 
after 2 days following treatment for the event. Of the 6 patients in the VR arm who experienced a 
Grade ≥3 IRR, none discontinued rituximab treatment or had a rituximab dose modification. 
In the BR arm, 9 patients experienced a serious Grade ≥ 3IRR. Of the 18 patients in the BR arm with a 
Grade ≥3 IRR, 3 patients discontinued rituximab treatment and 2 patients discontinued bendamustine. 
Additionally, 5 patients in the BR arm had a rituximab dose interruption due to a Grade ≥ 3 IRR. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
During the study most patients in both treatment arms either exhibited no shift or a worsening by 1 
grade in any particular hematology laboratory parameter and there was no marked difference between 
the V+R and BR treatment arms with regards to the number of patients experiencing a shift from 
baseline in their haematology laboratory parameters. An exception was neutrophil count (hypo) where 
patients in the V+R arm who started with neutropenia at baseline were observed to experience a shift 
to a worse grade during treatment. 
Blood Chemistry 
During the study most patients in both treatment arms either exhibited no shift or a worsening by 1 
grade and there was no marked difference between the VR and BR treatment arms.  
The only exception was Grade 3/4 low phosphorus values which were reported in 30/194 patients 
(15.5%) of patients in the V+R arm and 8/188 patients (4.3%) of patients in the BR arm. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: Higher rates of SAEs in the VR arm were observed in patients ≥65 years of age as compared to 
patients < 65 years (51.5% vs. 41.2%) (serious neoplasms (11.3% vs. 2.1%) and serious 
gastrointestinal disorders (8.2% vs. 1.0%).   
There were no differences in the pattern of AEs between male and female patients. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A numerically higher rate of treatment withdrawals of any study treatment due to an AE was observed 
in the VR analysis sets compared with the BR analysis set, 15.7% in the VR 400 mg dose analysis set 
vs. 9.6% in the BR analysis set. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, 
pneumonia, and malignant neoplasm progression (reported as an AE in Study M13-365) were the most 
frequently reported AEs (≥1% of patients) leading to discontinuation of venetoclax.  
Overall, the number of patients with at least one AE leading to venetoclax dose interruption was 
141/210 (67.1%) in the VR 400 mg dose analysis set. The most frequent AE that resulted in 
venetoclax dose interruption was neutropenia (40.5%).  Other frequently reported AEs leading to dose

interruption included diarrhoea (4.8%), thrombocytopenia (4.3%), pneumonia and nausea (3.8% 
each), URTI (3.3%), neutrophil count decreased (2.9%), and bronchitis and influenza (2.4% each). 
Post marketing experience 
No additional safety signal identified. World-wide cumulative exposure: 778 patient-treatment years. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The addition of rituximab to venetoclax results, as expected, in an increase in haematological toxicity. 
Especially neutropenia led to interruption and sometimes dose reduction. CLL per se is associated with 
an increase in infectious events and the increase is of similar magnitude as seen for BR.  
The overall safety profile of Venclyxto is based on data from 490 patients with CLL treated in clinical 
trials with venetoclax in combination with rituximab or as monotherapy. The safety analysis included 
patients from one phase III study (MURANO), two phase 2 studies (M13-982 and M14-032), and one 
phase 1 study (M12-175). MURANO was a randomised, controlled trial in which 194 patients with 
previously treated CLL received venetoclax in combination with rituximab. In the phase 2 and phase 1 
studies, 296 patients with previously treated CLL, which included 188 patients with 17p deletion and 
92 patients who had failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor were treated with venetoclax 
monotherapy (see section 5.1). 
In the open-label, randomised phase III study (MURANO), the incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in 
patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the study, the 
protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described 
in Posology (see section 4.2). All events of TLS occurred during the venetoclax dose-titration phase 
and resolved within two days. All six patients completed the dose titration and reached the 
recommended daily dose of 400 mg of venetoclax. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who 
followed the current 5-week dose-titration schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures 
(see section 4.2). The rates of grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia 
1%, hyperphosphatemia 1%, and hyperuricemia 1%. 
Neutropenia is an identified risk with Venclyxto treatment. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been reported 
in patients treated with venetoclax in the combination study with rituximab (GO28667/MURANO) and 
in the monotherapy studies (see section 4.8). In the MURANO study, neutropenia was reported in 61% 
(all grades) of patients on the venetoclax + rituximab arm. Forty-three percent of patients treated with 
venetoclax + rituximab experienced dose interruption and 3% of patients discontinued venetoclax due 
to neutropenia. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 32% of patients and grade 4 neutropenia in 26% 
of patients. The median duration of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 8 days (range: 1-712 days). With 
venetoclax + rituximab treatment, febrile neutropenia was reported in 4% of patients, grade ≥3 
infections in 18%, and serious infections in 21% of patients.  
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax 
in the combination study with rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract 
infection. In the monotherapy studies, the most common adverse reactions were 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea, nausea, anaemia, fatigue, and upper respiratory 
tract infection.

The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (≥2%) in patients receiving  venetoclax in 
combination with rituximab or as monotherapy were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and TLS. 
Richter transformation, in clinical practice observed as rapid progression of transformed lymphoma is 
expected and was observed in similar incidence in VR and BR.  
Second primary malignancies were observed and should be further characterised in relation to duration 
of exposure and observation, etc. A numerical increase is observed also in the update in the MURANO 
study and appears driven by non-melanoma skin cancer. Second primaries should remain an important 
potential risk in the RMP. The likely magnitude of the potential risk does not influence the risk 
assessment to an important degree.  
Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients treated with the combination of 
venetoclax and rituximab in the MURANO study. In the monotherapy studies with venetoclax, 9% of 
patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. 
Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients treated with the combination 
of venetoclax and rituximab in the MURANO study and 12% of patients treated with venetoclax in the 
monotherapy studies. 
In the MURANO study, dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 71% of patients treated 
with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose 
interruption of venetoclax was neutropenia (43%). 
Tolerability of 6 cycles of VR as measured by discontinuation and AEs seems to be similar to 6 cycles 
BR. Monotherapy for 18 months is associated with 7% AEs leading to withdrawal. 
Relevant amendments have been introduced in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns related to venetoclax have been identified and add-on of rituximab leads to 
the expected increase in bone marrow toxicity.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:  
• 
The submission of the final CSR from Study GO28667 (MURANO) in order to have an update on 
the overall safety profile with a special focus on the issues of Richter's transformation and 
secondary primary malignancy.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 3.3 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The condition for which Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is applied for is the treatment of adult 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Based on single arm studies showing impressive activity in hard to treat patients with CLL, Venclyxto is 
currently licensed for:  
• 
The treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who 
are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. 
•  Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or 
TP5 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell 
receptor pathway inhibitor.   
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatments for CLL are not curative. Fewer patients obtain responses with each subsequent 
regimen, and subjects become increasingly resistant to available therapy. Patients who relapse after a 
disease-free period of over 1 year (2-3 years for chemoimmunotherapy) are considered treatment 
sensitive and may be candidates for treatment reinitiation. Patients who relapse after a shorter 
interval, or are refractory to first-line treatment, present a more challenging group, particularly those 
who are older, have comorbid conditions, and/or harbour high-risk cytogenic abnormalities. Overall, 
there is a long expected survival (from time of diagnosis, 5-year relative survival rate about 75%). In 
the EUROCARE-5 registry, the survival rate for patients with CLL at 5 years post diagnosis was 69.0%. 
Due to the licensure of highly active new treatment options (venetoclax, ibrutinib, idelalisib), therapy 
in B-cell malignancies is in a dynamic phase.      
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
 The MURANO study was a randomised study comparing bendamustine + rituximab (BR) with 
venetoclax + rituximab (VR), both for six cycles followed by venetoclax versus no treatment up to a 
total study duration of 2 years in R/R CLL after at least one, but not more than three lines of therapy, 
thereof at least one “guideline compliant” regimen.  
The MA of Venclyxto was conditional to the reporting of study M14-032, whilst reporting of the current 
study MURANO was an annex IIE obligation. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint (ITT), PFS, showed a HR 0.17, with event rates 59% for the BR arm and 17% in 
the VR arm, p< 0.0001 (investigator assessment). At an updated efficacy analysis with all patients off 
treatment (data cut-off date 8 May 2018 and median follow-up of 36 months) the 36-month PFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717199/2018  
Page 55/60 
 
 
 
 
 
estimate in the venetoclax + rituximab arm was 71.4% [95% CI: 64.8, 78.1] and in the bendamustine 
+ rituximab arm was 15.2% [95% CI: 9.1, 21]. 
The observed PFS benefit of venetoclax + rituximab  compared with bendamustine + rituximab was 
consistently observed across all subgroups of patients evaluated, including age (< 65, ≥ 65 years and 
< 75, ≥ 75 years), prior lines of therapy (1, >1), bulky disease (< 5 cm, ≥ 5 cm), 17p deletion, 11q 
deletion, TP53 mutation, IgVH mutation, and refractory versus relapse to most recent therapy.  The 
HR for PFS (17p del) was HR 0.13, event rates 59% (BR) and 15% (VR) p< 0.0001 (investigator 
assessment) (predefined subgroup).  
With regard to the secondary endpoint CR+Cri (hierarchical testing), this was 3.6% (BR) vs. 8.2% 
(VT), p=0.08 (IRC). 
Efficacy results for the pre-specified primary analysis (data cut-off date 8 May 2017) were also 
assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) demonstrating a statistically significant 81% 
reduction in the risk of progression or death for patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab (hazard 
ratio: 0.19 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.28]; P<0.0001). Median DOR was not reached with median follow up of 
approximately 23.8 months. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Additional information on the long term outcome, would be needed as OS is still immature (20% and 
11% events). The exploratory HR was 0.5 (0.3; 0.85). Data  will be obtained through the final CSR of 
MURANO study (see RMP).   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of VR is manageable in the clinic with standard measures and adherence to 
Venclyxto (see SmPC section 4.2). Dose reductions/interruptions, mainly for neutropenia, were 
undertaken in about 2/3 patients. In the combination phase, neutropenia was also more pronounced in 
the VR arm. There was no difference in infectious events.  
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (≥20%) of any grade in patients receiving venetoclax 
in the combination study with rituximab were neutropenia, diarrhoea, and upper respiratory tract 
infection. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions (≥2%) in patients receiving  
venetoclax in combination with rituximab or as monotherapy were pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and 
TLS. 
Altogether 16% discontinued the combination phase and 9% the monotherapy phase.  
Second primary malignancies are included in the RMP as an important potential risk that should be 
monitored.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
B-cell malignancies is in a dynamic phase as highly active new treatment options (venetoclax, 
ibrutinib, idelalisib), are approved. Licensure was conditional to the reporting of study M14-032, whilst 
reporting of the current study MURANO was an annex IIE obligation.  
In studies comparing induction + maintenance vs. induction only, endpoints beyond first time to 
progression or deaths are expected to support licensure according to the current NfG. In this case an 
established standard of care regimen (BR) over 6 months is compared with an experimental regimen 
(VR) over 2 years, i.e. two regimens of different durations were compared. This may justify a partly 
different approach from an assessment perspective, not least as CLL is an indolent disease with 
durable responses also in the R/R stage and beyond.   
In the interim analysis submitted to support licensure of the VR regimen, the primary endpoint and all 
supportive measures of efficacy clearly indicated that VR is superior to BR. The pattern of recurrence 
after end of therapy in the VR arm, a highly relevant outcome measure from a clinical perspective, 
provided too limited information for an assessment. Based on the update, it appears clear that the 
recurrence pattern off-therapy in the VR arm is not worse than the pattern in the BR. As the roughly 
estimated “truncated” mean time to next line of therapy appears longer than 18 months (24 – 36 
months) a benefit of VR over BR also from the perspective of “time off-therapy” is likely, but not 
proven yet.  
The safety profile of VR is manageable, dose reductions/interruptions, mainly for neutropenia were 
undertaken in about 2/3 patients. In the combination phase, neutropenia was also more pronounced in

the VR arm. There was no difference in infectious events. Altogether 16% discontinued the 
combination phase and 9% the monotherapy phase. Altogether the intensity of treatment is rather 
high, but clinically clearly manageable by standard measures.       
CLL in response may be viewed as an essentially symptom-free disease and next-line therapy is 
normally instituted in case of symptomatic disease. A delay in the initiation of next-line therapy has 
been shown to be achievable with an HR of 0.2, corresponding to a roughly estimated truncated mean 
of more than 18 months. These data are immature, and assuming that there are no major differences 
in duration of next-line therapies, the VR regimen despite its longer duration, is unlikely to result in a 
totality of more time on therapy with associated side effects than the use of BR in treatment 
experienced patients with CLL. At this early time point, besides the benefit of higher response rates 
and longer estimated PFS, OS data also look favourable to the experimental regimen.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Altogether benefit – risk is found to be favourable, but there are outstanding issues that should be 
addressed in the final study report. Apart from updates of OS, PFS (e.g. reported as restricted mean 
time) and, e.g. comparative time on/off therapy, an update of MRD data is of clear interest. This may 
enable a more detailed analysis of pattern of recurrence in responding patients off therapy, e.g. 
recurrence in relation to depth of response (by quantitative data, not only dichotomized) and the 
possible additional relevance of study therapy.  
Final safety data for the monotherapy phase will be reported (see RMP).   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Venetoclax in combination with rituximab in the treatment of adult patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy is concluded to be 
positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include Venclyxto in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
This submission also fulfils the Annex II condition to submit the results of the MURANO study 
comparing venetoclax plus rituximab to bendamustine plus rituximab in patients with 
relapsed/refractory CLL.  
In addition, RMP version 3.3 (in version 2 of the RMP template) is being approved.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

Page 59/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Venclyxto is not similar to Arzerra (ofatumomab), 
Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) and Imbruvica (ibrutinib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix I 
5.   EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include Venclyxto in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
This submission also fulfils the Annex II condition to submit the results of the MURANO study 
comparing venetoclax plus rituximab to bendamustine plus rituximab in patients with 
relapsed/refractory CLL. 
In addition, RMP version 3.3 (in version 2 of the RMP template) is being approved.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Reagila is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose of cariprazine is 1.5 mg once daily. Thereafter the dose can be 
increased slowly in 1.5 mg increments to a maximum dose of 6 mg/day, if needed. The lowest 
effective dose should be maintained according to the clinical judgement of the treating physician. 
Because of the long half-life of cariprazine and its active metabolites, changes in dose will not be fully 
reflected in plasma for several weeks. Patients should be monitored for adverse reactions and 
treatment response for several weeks after starting cariprazine and after each dose change (see section 
5.2). 
Switching from other antipsychotics to cariprazine 
When switching from another antipsychotic to cariprazine gradual cross-titration should be 
considered, with gradual discontinuation of the previous treatment while cariprazine treatment is 
initiated. 
Switching to another antipsychotic from cariprazine 
When switching to another antipsychotic from cariprazine, no gradual cross-titration is needed, the 
new antipsychotic should be initiated in its lowest dose while cariprazine is discontinued. It should be 
considered that plasma concentration of cariprazine and its active metabolites will decline by 50% in 
~1 week (see section 5.2). 
Missed dose 
If the patient misses a dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible. However, if it 
is almost time for the next dose, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken 
according to the regular schedule. It is not recommended to take a double dose to make up for the 
forgotten dose. 
Special population 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Creatinine 
Clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min and < 89 mL/min). Safety and efficacy of cariprazine have not been 
evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Use of cariprazine is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score between 5-9). Safety and efficacy of cariprazine have not been evaluated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 10 and 15). Use of cariprazine is not recommended in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
Available data in elderly patients aged ≥ 65 years treated with cariprazine are not sufficient to 
determine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients (see section 5.2). Dose 
selection for an elderly patient should be more cautious. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cariprazine in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Reagila is for oral use, to be taken once daily at the same time of the day with or without food. 
Alcohol should be avoided when taking cariprazine (see section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Concomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
The possibility of suicidality (suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide) is inherent in 
psychotic illnesses and, generally, it is reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic 
therapy. Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy. 
Akathisia, restlessness 
Akathisia and restlessness is a frequently occurring adverse reaction of antipsychotics. Akathisia is a 
movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in 
constant motion, as well as by actions such as rocking while standing or sitting, lifting the feet as if 
marching on the spot, and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting. As cariprazine causes 
akathisia and restlessness, it should be used cautiously in patients who are prone to or already exhibit 
symptoms of akathisia. Akathisia develops early in treatment. Therefore close monitoring in the first 
phase of treatment is important. Prevention includes slow up-titration; treatment measures include 
slight down-titration of cariprazine or anti-EPS medicinal product The dose can be modified based on 
individual response and tolerability (see section 4.8). 
Tardive dyskinesia 
Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, rhythmical, involuntary 
movements, predominantly of the tongue and/or face that can develop in patients treated with 
antipsychotics. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with 
cariprazine, discontinuation should be considered. 
Parkinson's disease 
If prescribed to patients with Parkinson's disease, antipsychotic medicinal products may exacerbate the 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
underlying disease and worsen symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Physicians should, therefore, weigh 
the risks versus the benefits when prescribing cariprazine to patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Ocular symptoms/cataract 
In the preclinical studies of cariprazine lens opacity/cataract was detected in dogs (see sections 4.8 and 
5.3). However, a causal relationship between lenticular changes / cataracts observed in human studies 
and cariprazine use has not been established. Nevertheless, patients who would develop symptoms 
potentially related to cataract should be advised to ophthalmologic examination and re-evaluated for 
treatment continuation. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) 
A potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as NMS has been reported in association with 
antipsychotic treatment. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, elevated 
serum creatine phosphokinase levels, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability 
(irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs 
may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and 
symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical 
manifestations of NMS, cariprazine must be discontinued immediately. 
Seizures and convulsions 
Cariprazine should be used cautiously in patients with history of seizures or with conditions that 
potentially lower the seizure threshold. 
Elderly patients with dementia 
Cariprazine has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia and is not recommended to treat 
elderly patients with dementia due to increased risk of overall mortality.  
Risk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) 
An approximately 3-fold increased risk of CVA has been seen in randomised placebo-controlled 
clinical studies in the dementia population with some atypical antipsychotics. The mechanism for this 
increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other 
patient populations. Cariprazine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for stroke. 
Cardiovascular disorders 
Blood pressure changes 
Cariprazine can cause orthostatic hypotension as well as hypertension (see section 4.8). Cariprazine 
should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease predisposing to blood 
pressure changes. Blood pressure should be monitored. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes 
QT prolongation can develop in patients treated with antipsychotics. 
With cariprazine no QT interval prolongation was detected compared to placebo in a clinical study 
designed to assess QT prolongation (see section 5.1). In clinical studies, only a few, non-serious, QT-
prolongations have been reported with cariprazine (see section 4.8). Therefore, cariprazine should be 
used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular disease or in patients with a family history of 
QT prolongation and in patients treated with medicinal products that might cause QT prolongation 
(see section 5.1). 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
Cases of VTE have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with 
antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be identified before and during treatment with cariprazine and preventive measures undertaken. 
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus 
Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or patients with risk factors for diabetes 
mellitus (e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical 
antipsychotics should be monitored for serum glucose levels. In clinical studies, glucose-related 
adverse reactions have been reported with cariprazine (see section 5.1). 
Weight change 
Significant weight gain has been observed with the use of cariprazine. Patients should have their 
weight monitored regularly (see section 4.8). 
Excipients 
Reagila 3 mg, 4.5 mg and 6 mg hard capsules contain Allura red AC (E 129), which may cause 
allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect cariprazine 
Metabolism of cariprazine and its major active metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and 
didesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR), is mediated mainly by CYP3A4 with a minor contribution of 
CYP2D6. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused two-fold increase in plasma exposure for total 
cariprazine (sum of cariprazine and its active metabolites) during short-term (4 days) 
co-administration, either if unbound or unbound+bound moieties considered. 
Due to the long half-life of the active moieties of cariprazine a further increase in plasma exposure of 
total cariprazine can be expected during longer co-administration. Therefore, co-administration of 
cariprazine with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). Consumption of grapefruit juice should be avoided. 
CYP3A4 inducers 
Co-administration of cariprazine with strong and moderate inducers of CYP3A4 may result in a 
significant decrease in total cariprazine exposure, therefore the co-administration of cariprazine and 
strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St. 
John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
CYP2D6 inhibitors 
CYP2D6 mediated pathway plays a minor role in the metabolism of cariprazine, the major pathway is 
via CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore CYP2D6 inhibitors are unlikely to have a clinically relevant 
effect on cariprazine metabolism. 
Potential for cariprazine to affect other medicinal products 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates 
Cariprazine is a P-gp inhibitor in vitro at its theoretical maximum intestinal concentration. The clinical 
consequences of this effect is not fully understood, however the use of P-gp substrates with narrow 
therapeutic index such as dabigatran and digoxin could require extra monitoring and dose adjustment.

Hormonal contraceptives 
 In a drug interaction study, 28 days of treatment with cariprazine at 6 mg daily had no clinically 
relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Given the primary central nervous system effects of cariprazine, Reagila should be used with caution 
in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on Reagila. Female 
patients of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment 
and for at least 10 weeks following the last dose of Reagila. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of cariprazine in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including developmental malformations in rats 
(see section 5.3). 
Reagila is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
effective contraception. After discontinuation of cariprazine treatment contraception should be used 
for at least 10 weeks due to the slow elimination of active moieties. 
Neonates exposed to antipsychotics (including cariprazine) during the third trimester of pregnancy are 
at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in 
severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress or feeding disorder. These complications have varied in 
severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases, neonates have required 
intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Consequently, newborns should be 
monitored carefully. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether cariprazine or its major active metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Cariprazine and its metabolites are excreted in milk of rats during lactation (see section 5.3). A risk to 
the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
cariprazine. 
Fertility 
The effect of cariprazine on human fertility has not been evaluated. In rat studies lower female fertility 
and conception indices were observed (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cariprazine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should 
be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably 
certain that therapy with Reagila does not affect them adversely.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with cariprazine in the dose range 
(1.5-6 mg) were akathisia (19%) and parkinsonism (17.5%). Most events were mild to moderate in 
severity. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Lens opacity/Cataract 
Development of cataracts was observed in cariprazine non-clinical studies (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
cataract formation was closely monitored with slit lamp examinations in the clinical studies and 
patients with existing cataracts were excluded. During the schizophrenia clinical development program 
of cariprazine, few cataract cases were reported, characterized with minor lens opacities with no visual 
impairment (13/3192; 0.4%). Some of these patients had confounding factors. The most commonly 
reported ocular adverse event was blurred vision (placebo: 1/683; 0.1%, cariprazine: 22/2048; 1.1%). 
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) 
In the short-term studies the incidence of EPS was observed in 27%; 11.5%; 30.7% and 15.1% in 
patients treated with cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and aripiprazole respectively. Akathisia was 
reported in 13.6%; 5.1%; 9.3% and 9.9% in patients treated with cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and 
aripiprazole respectively. Parkinsonism was experienced in 13.6%; 5.7%; 22.1% and 5.3% in patients 
treated with cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and aripiprazole respectively. Dystonia was observed in 
1.8%; 0.2%; 3.6% and 0.7% in patients on cariprazine, placebo, risperidone and aripiprazole, 
respectively.  
In the placebo-controlled part of the long-term maintenance of effect study EPS was 13.7% in the 
cariprazine group compared to 3.0% in the placebo treated patients. Akathisia was reported in 3.9% in 
patients treated with cariprazine, versus 2.0% in the placebo group. Parkinsonism was experienced in 
7.8% and 1.0% in cariprazine and placebo group respectively.  
In the negative symptom study EPS was reported in 14.3% in the cariprazine group and 11.7% in the 
risperidone treated patients. Akathisia was reported in 10.0% in patients treated with cariprazine and 
5.2% in the risperidone group. Parkinsonism was experienced in 5.2% and 7.4% in cariprazine and 
risperidone treated patients respectively. Most EPS cases were mild to moderate in intensity and could 
be handled with common anti-EPS medicinal products. The rate of discontinuation due to EPS related 
ADRs was low. 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
Cases of VTE, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein thrombosis have been 
reported with antipsychotics - Frequency unknown. 
Elevated liver transaminases 
Elevated liver transaminases (Alanine Aminotransferase [ALT], Aspartate Aminotransferase [AST]) 
are frequently observed with antipsychotic treatment. In the cariprazine clinical studies the incidence 
of ALT, AST elevation ADRs occurred in 2.2% of cariprazine-, 1.6% of risperidone- and 0.4% of 
placebo-treated patients. None of the cariprazine-treated patients had any liver damage.

Weight changes 
In the short-term studies, there were slightly greater mean increases in body weight in the cariprazine 
group compared to the placebo group; 1 kg and 0.3 kg, respectively. In the long-term maintenance of 
effect study, there was no clinically relevant difference in change of body weight from baseline to end 
of treatment (1.1 kg for cariprazine and 0.9 kg for placebo). In the open-label phase of the study 
during 20 weeks cariprazine treatment 9.0% of patients developed potentially clinically significant 
(PCS) weight gain (defined as increase ≥ 7%) while during the double-blind phase, 9.8 % of the 
patients who continued with cariprazine treatment had PCS weight gain versus 7.1% of the patients 
who were randomized to placebo after the 20 week open-label cariprazine treatment. In the negative 
symptom study, the mean change of body weight was -0.3 kg for cariprazine and +0.6 kg for 
risperidone and PCS weight gain was observed in 6% of the cariprazine group while 7.4% of the 
risperidone group.  
QT- prolongation 
With cariprazine no QT interval prolongation was detected compared to placebo in a clinical study 
designed to assess QT prolongation (see section 5.1). In other clinical studies, only a few, non-serious, 
QT-prolongations have been reported with cariprazine. During the long-term, open-label treatment 
period in, 3 patients (0.4%) had QTcB > 500 msec, one of whom also had QTcF > 500 msec. A > 60 
msec increase from baseline was observed in 7 patients (1%) for QTcB and in 2 patients (0.3%) for 
QTcF. In the long-term, maintenance of effect study, during the open-label phase, > 60 msec increase 
of from baseline was observed in 12 patients (1.6%) for QTcB and in 4 patients (0.5%) for QTcF. 
During the double-blind treatment period, > 60 msec increases from baseline in QTcB were observed 
in 3 cariprazine-treated patients (3.1%) and 2 placebo-treated patients (2%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Accidental acute overdose (48 mg/day) was reported in one patient. This patient experienced 
orthostasis and sedation. The patient fully recovered the same day. 
Management of overdose 
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy including maintenance of an 
adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation and management of symptoms. Cardiovascular 
monitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for 
possible arrhythmias. In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medicinal products 
should be administered. Since cariprazine is highly bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is 
unlikely to be useful in the management of overdose. Close medical supervision and monitoring 
should continue until the patient recovers. 
There is no specific antidote to cariprazine.

5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX15 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of cariprazine is not fully known. However the therapeutic effect of 
cariprazine may be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at dopamine D3, D2 (Ki 
values of 0.085-0.3 nM versus 0.49-0.71 nM respectively) and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (Ki values 
of 1.4-2.6 nM), and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT2B, 5-HT2A and histamine H1 receptors (Ki 
values of 0.58-1.1 nM, 18.8 nM and 23.3 nM, respectively). Cariprazine has low affinity for serotonin 
5-HT2C and adrenergic α1 receptors (Ki values of 134 nM and 155 nM, respectively). Cariprazine has 
no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM). The two major active 
metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine and didesmethyl cariprazine have a similar in vitro receptor 
binding and functional activity profile as the parent active substance 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In vivo non-clinical studies demonstrated that cariprazine occupies D3 receptors to a similar extent as 
D2 receptors at pharmacologically effective doses. There was a dose-dependent occupancy of brain 
dopamine D3 and D2 receptors (with preferential occupancy in regions with higher D3 expression) in 
patients with schizophrenia within the therapeutic dose range of cariprazine for 15 days. 
The effects of cariprazine on the QT interval were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder. Holter monitor-derived electrocardiographic assessments were obtained in 
129 patients over a twelve hour period at baseline and steady state. No QT interval prolongation was 
detected following supratherapeutic doses (9 mg/day or 18 mg/day). No patients treated with 
cariprazine experienced QTc increases ≥ 60 msec from baseline, nor did any patient experience a QTc 
of > 500 msec in the study. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy with short-term use 
The efficacy of cariprazine for the treatment of acute schizophrenia was studied in three multi-center, 
multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week studies including 1,754 patients 
with the age of 18 to 60 years. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in the 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and the secondary endpoint was change 
from baseline to week 6 in the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score in all acute 
schizophrenia studies. In a multinational placebo-controlled study using fixed doses of 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg 
and 4.5 mg cariprazine and 4.0 mg risperidone for assay sensitivity, all cariprazine doses and the 
active-control showed statistically significant improvement in both primary as well as secondary 
endpoint compared to placebo. In another multinational placebo-controlled study using fixed doses of 
3.0 mg, and 6.0 mg cariprazine and 10 mg aripiprazole for assay sensitivity, both cariprazine doses 
and the active-control showed statistically significant improvement in both primary as well as 
secondary endpoint compared to placebo. In a third multinational placebo-controlled study using 
fixed/flexible doses of 3.0-6.0 mg and 6.0-9.0 mg cariprazine, both cariprazine doses groups showed 
statistically significant improvement in both primary as well as secondary endpoint compared to 
placebo. 
Results for the primary outcome parameter are summarized in Table 2 below. Results for the 
secondary outcome parameter (CGI) and additional endpoints were supportive of the primary 
endpoint.

Efficacy with long-term use 
The efficacy of cariprazine for maintaining antipsychotic effect was investigated in a randomized-
withdrawal, long-term clinical study. Totally, 751 patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia 
received cariprazine 3-9 mg/day for 20 weeks, of whom 337 received cariprazine in the dose-range of 
3 or 6 mg/day. Stabilized patients were then randomised to receive fixed doses of 3 or 6 mg 
cariprazine (n=51) or placebo (n=51) in a double-blind manner for up to 72 weeks. The primary 
outcome of the study was time to relapse. By the end of the study 49.0% of placebo-treated patients 
versus 21.6% of cariprazine-treated patients had a relapse of schizophrenic symptoms. Time to relapse 
(92 vs. 326 days-based on the 25th percentile) was therefore significantly longer in the cariprazine 
group than in the placebo group (p=0.009). 
Efficacy in predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia 
The efficacy of cariprazine for the treatment of predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia 
was investigated in a 26-week, multi-centre, double-blind, and active-controlled clinical study. 
Cariprazine (dose range 3-6 mg, target dose 4.5 mg) was investigated compared to risperidone (dose 
range 3-6 mg, target dose 4 mg) in patients with persistent, predominant negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia (n=461). 86% of patients were less than 55 years old, 54% of them were male. 
Persistent predominant negative symptoms were defined as symptoms lasting for a period of at least 
6 months with high level of negative symptoms and low level of positive symptoms [(PANSS factor 
score for negative symptoms ≥ 24, a score of ≥ 4 on a minimum 2 of the 3 PANSS items (N1: flat 
affect, N4: avolition, and N6: poverty of speech) and PANSS factor score for positive symptoms 
≤ 19]. Patients with secondary negative symptoms, such as moderate to severe depressive symptoms 
and clinically relevant parkinsonism (EPS) were excluded. 
Both cariprazine- and risperidone-treated patient groups have shown statistically significant 
improvement in the change from baseline for the primary efficacy parameter, PANSS factor score for 
negative symptoms (PANSS-FSNS) (p < 0.001). However, a statistically significant difference 
(p=0.002) in favour of cariprazine over risperidone was observed from Week 14 onward (Table 3).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
cariprazine in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia. See 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Cariprazine has two pharmacologically active metabolites with similar activities as cariprazine, 
desmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR). Total cariprazine (sum of 
cariprazine + DCAR and DDCAR) exposure approaches 50% of steady state exposure in ~1 week of 
daily dosing while 90% of steady state is achieved in 3 weeks. At steady state, exposure to DDCAR is 
approximately two to three-fold higher than to cariprazine, and exposure to DCAR is approximately 
30% of cariprazine exposure. 
Absorption  
Absolute bioavailability of cariprazine is unknown. Cariprazine is well absorbed after oral 
administration. Following multiple-dose administration, peak plasma concentrations for cariprazine 
and the major active metabolites generally occur at approximately 3-8 hours post dose. 
Administration of a single dose of 1.5 mg cariprazine with a high-fat meal (900 to 1,000 calories) did 
not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of cariprazine (AUC0-∞ increased by 12%, Cmax decreased by 
< 5% under fed condition versus fasting). The effect of food on the exposure of the metabolites DCAR 
and DDCAR was also minimal. 
Cariprazine can be administered with or without food. 
Distribution 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 916 L 
for cariprazine, 475 L for DCAR and 1,568 L for DDCAR, indicating extensive distribution of 
cariprazine and its major active metabolites. Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are highly 
bound (96 to 97% for CAR, 94% to 97% for DCAR and 92% to 97% for DDCAR) to plasma proteins. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of cariprazine involves demethylation (DCAR and DDCAR), hydroxylation (hydroxy 
cariprazine, HCAR) and a combination of demethylation and hydroxylation (hydroxy desmethyl 
cariprazine, HDCAR and hydroxy didesmethyl cariprazine, HDDCAR). The metabolites of HCAR, 
HDCAR, and HDDCAR are subsequently biotransformed to their corresponding sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates. An additional metabolite, desdichlorophenyl piperazine cariprazine 
(DDCPPCAR) acid, is produced by dealkylation and subsequent oxidation of cariprazine. 
Cariprazine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6, to DCAR and HCAR. 
DCAR is further metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 into DDCAR and 
HDCAR. DDCAR is further metabolised to HDDCAR by CYP3A4. 
Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the organic 
anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), and the breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). This suggests that an interaction of cariprazine with inhibitors of P-gp, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP is unlikely. 
Elimination 
Elimination of cariprazine and its major active metabolites is mainly through hepatic metabolism. 
Following administration of 12.5 mg/day cariprazine to patients with schizophrenia, 20.8% of the dose 
was excreted in urine as cariprazine and its metabolites. 
Unchanged cariprazine is excreted by 1.2% of the dose in urine and 3.7% of the dose in faeces. 
The mean terminal half-life (1 to 3 days for cariprazine and DCAR and 13 to 19 days for DDCAR) is 
not predictive of time to reach steady state or plasma concentration decline after treatment 
discontinuation. For the management of patients treated with cariprazine, the effective half-life is more 
relevant than the terminal half-life. The effective (functional) half-life is ~ 2 days for cariprazine and 
DCAR, 8 days for DDCAR and is ~1 week for total cariprazine. The plasma concentration of total 
cariprazine will gradually decline following dose discontinuation or interruption. The plasma 
concentration of total cariprazine decreases by 50% in ~1 week and greater than 90% decline in total 
cariprazine concentration occurs in ~3 weeks. 
Linearity 
After repeated administration plasma exposure of cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, 
desmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR), increases proportionally over 
the therapeutic dose range of 1.5 to 6 mg. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using data from patients enrolled in the 
schizophrenia cariprazine clinical program with differing levels of renal function, including normal 
renal function (creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 90 mL/min), as well as mild (CrCl 60 to 89 mL/min) and 
moderate (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment. No significant relationship was found between 
cariprazine plasma clearance and creatinine clearance. 
Cariprazine has not been evaluated in patients with severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment (see 
section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
A 2-part study (a single dose of 1 mg cariprazine [Part A] and a daily dose of 0.5 mg cariprazine for 
14 days [Part B] was conducted in patients with varying degrees of impaired hepatic function (Child-
Pugh Classes A and B). Compared to healthy subjects, patients with either mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment had up to approximately 25% higher exposure (Cmax and AUC) for cariprazine and up to 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 45% lower exposure for the major active metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine and 
didesmethyl cariprazine, following the single dose of 1 mg cariprazine or 0.5 mg cariprazine for 
14 days. 
The total active moiety (CAR+DCAR+DDCAR) exposure (AUC and Cmax) decreased by 21-22% and 
13-15% in mild or moderate hepatic impairment (HI), respectively, compared to healthy subjects if 
unbound + bound concentrations were considered, while for unbound total moiety a decrease of 12-
13% and an increase of 20-25% were calculated in mild HI patients and in moderate HI patients, 
respectively, after multiple dosing of cariprazine. 
Cariprazine has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) 
(see section 4.2). 
Age, gender and race 
In the population PK analysis there were no clinically relevant differences in the PK parameters (AUC 
and Cmax of the sum of cariprazine and its major active metabolites) based on age, gender and race. 
This analysis included 2,844 patients of different races, involving 536 patients between the ages of 50 
and 65. Of the 2,844 patients 933 were female (see section 4.2). In elderly patients above 65 years of 
age data are limited. 
Smoking status 
Because cariprazine is not a substrate for CYP1A2, smoking is not expected to have an effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of cariprazine. 
Potential for cariprazine to affect other medicinal products 
Cariprazine and its major active metabolites did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes 
and were not inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP219, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are not inhibitors of 
transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), and organic anion 
transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3) in vitro. DCAR and DDCAR were not inhibitors of 
transporter P-gp although cariprazine was a P-gp inhibitor in the intestine (see section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Cariprazine caused bilateral cataract and secondary retinal changes (retinal detachment and cystic 
degeneration) in the dog. The exposure (AUC of total cariprazine) at the no-observed-adverse-effect-
level (NOAEL) for ocular toxicity is 4.2-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximal recommended 
human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day. Increased incidence of retinal degeneration/atrophy was observed 
in albino rats in the 2-year study at clinically relevant exposures. 
Phospholipidosis was observed in the lungs of rats, dogs, and mice (with or without inflammation) and 
in the adrenal gland cortex of dogs at clinically relevant exposures. Inflammation was observed in the 
lungs of dogs dosed for 1 year with a NOAEL at AUC exposures 2.7 (males) and 1.7 (females) times 
the clinical exposure at the MRHD. No inflammation was observed at the end of 2-month drug-free 
period at an exposure 4.2 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD; however, inflammation was still 
present at higher doses. 
Hypertrophy of the adrenal gland cortex was observed at 4.1 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD 
in rats (females only) and at clinically relevant total cariprazine plasma concentrations in mice. In 
dogs, reversible hypertrophy/hyperplasia and vacuolation/vesiculation of the adrenal gland cortex 
were observed with a NOAEL 4.2 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD. 
In female rats, lower fertility and conception indices were observed at clinically relevant exposures 
based on mg/m2 body surface area. No effects on male fertility were noted at exposures up to 4.3 times 
the clinical exposure at the MRHD. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of cariprazine to rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations, lower 
pup survival, and developmental delays at drug exposures less than the human exposure at the MRHD 
of 6 mg/day. In rabbits, cariprazine caused maternal toxicity, but no foetal toxicity at exposures 
5.8 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD. 
Administration of cariprazine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, throughout 
pregnancy and lactation at clinically relevant exposures decreased postnatal survival, birth weight, and 
post-weaning body weight of first-generation pups. In addition, pale, cold bodies and developmental 
delays (renal papillae not developed/underdeveloped and decreased auditory startle response in males) 
were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. Reproductive performance of the first-generation 
pups was unaffected; however, second generation pups also had similar clinical signs and lower body 
weight. 
Cariprazine and its metabolites were excreted in milk of rats during lactation.

Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during Reagila treatment. Even 
after treatment is stopped, contraception must be used for at least 10 weeks after your last dose of

taken. 
Pregnancy 
Do not take this medicine during pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to do so. 
If your doctor decides that you should take this medicine during pregnancy, your doctor will monitor 
your baby closely after birth. This is because the following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of 
mothers who have used this medicine in the last trimester (last three months) of their pregnancy: 
shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and 
- 
difficulty in feeding. 
If your baby develops any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Reagila because a risk for the baby cannot be excluded. Contact 
your doctor for advice.  
Driving and using machines 
There is a minor or moderate risk that the medicine could affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Drowsiness, dizziness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see section 
4). Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know that this medicine does not affect you in 
a negative way.

Allura red AC is a coloring agent, which may cause allergic reactions. 
3. 
How to take Reagila 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The recommended starting dose is 1.5 mg once a day by mouth. Thereafter, the dose may be slowly 
adjusted by your doctor, in steps of 1.5 mg, depending on how the treatment works for you. 
The maximum dose should not exceed 6 mg once a day. 
Take Reagila at the same time each day with or without food. 
If you were taking another medicine to treat schizophrenia before starting Reagila, your doctor will 
decide whether to stop the other medicine gradually or immediately and how to adjust the dose of 
Reagila. Your doctor will also inform you how to act if you switch from Reagila to another medicine. 
Patients with kidney or liver problems 
If you have serious kidney or liver problems Reagila may not be appropriate for you. Talk to your 
doctor. 
Elderly patients 
Your doctor will carefully select the appropriate dose for your needs. 
Reagila should not be used by elderly patients with dementia (loss of memory). 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you take more Reagila than you should 
If you have taken more Reagila than your doctor has recommended or if, for example, a child has 
taken it by mistake, contact your doctor or go to the nearest hospital right away and take the pack of 
the medicine with you. You may experience dizziness from low blood pressure, or have abnormal 
heartbeats, you may feel sleepy, tired, or have abnormal body movements and find it difficult to stand 
or walk. 
If you forget to take Reagila 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your 
next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you miss two or more doses, contact your doctor. 
If you stop taking Reagila 
If you stop taking this medicine you will lose the effects of the medicine. Even if you feel better, do 
not alter or stop your daily dose of Reagila unless told to do so by your doctor as your symptoms may 
return.

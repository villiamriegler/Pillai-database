2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1 
Introduction 
Aripiprazole,  a  dihydrocarbostyril  (quinolinone)  derivative,  is  an  antipsychotic  agent.  Aripiprazole 
(Abilify)  was  authorised  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  on  4  June  2004.  Aripiprazole  tablets, 
orodispersible  tablets  and  oral  solution  are  currently  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of 
schizophrenia in adults with recommended starting dose of 10 mg or 15 mg/day and target dose of 15 
mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. These formulations are also 
indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I disorder and for the 
prevention of a new manic episode in adult patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes 
and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.  
Abilify tablets, orodispersible tablets and oral solution are also approved in the EU for the treatment 
of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older and in the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate 
to  severe  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  Disorder  in  adolescents  aged  13 years  and  older.  The 
recommended  dose  in  these  patient  groups  is  10 mg/day  administered  on  a  once-a-day  schedule 
without regard to meals. Treatment should be initiated at 2 mg (using Abilify oral solution 1 mg/ml) 
for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When 
appropriate,  subsequent  dose  increases  should  be  administered  in  5  mg  increments  without 
exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg for adolescents 15 years and older with schizophrenia. 
In adolescents aged 13 years and older with Bipolar I disorder, enhanced efficacy at doses higher than 
a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated with a 
substantially higher incidence of significant undesirable effects. Doses higher than 10 mg/day should 
therefore only be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring. 
Aripiprazole intramuscular (7.5mg/ml, solution for injection) is specifically indicated for the treatment 
of the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients 
with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate. 
The present application does not concern aripiprazole intramuscular (7.5 mg/ml, solution for 
injection).  
This variation refers to update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) to include information related to studies 31-12-293 and 031-KOA-0703 conducted in 
patients (6-18 years) with Tourette's disorder (TD). 
2.2  Clinical efficacy aspects 
Tourette’s Disorder (TD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by childhood onset of 
motor and phonic tics. A dopaminergic hyperfunction in certain brain areas in Tourette’s Disorder 
would explain why postsynaptic dopamine antagonists such as antipsychotics as well as dopamine 
agonists with a presynaptic component may be effective in suppressing tics associated with TD. 
From epidemiological studies it is likely that the prevalence of TD in the general population ranges 
from 4.3 to 10 per 10,000 but may be as high as 100 per 10,000 in children between 8 and 12 years 
of age. 
The main characteristics of TD appear to be independent of culture and, in general, symptoms are 
similar worldwide. TD is found in all countries, all racial groups and is three to four times more 
common in males. Disability caused by TD however, is strongly related to the type of tics and social 
environment, and the extent to which tics may interfere with social role of the patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/557557/2014 
Page 3/21 
 
  
  
 
Although the precise etiology of TD remains unknown, disturbances in dopaminergic and/or 
serotonergic pathways have been implicated because of the close association between TD and other 
disorders that involve imbalances in dopamine and/or serotonin (eg, obsessive-compulsive disorder 
[OCD] and attention deficit disorder/attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder [ADD/ADHD]). 
Regarding such disorders, ADHD and OCD are the most prevalent comorbidities and occur in 84% of 
individuals with TD. 
The rationale for studying aripiprazole in TD is the fact that it exhibits partial agonism at dopamine D2 
and serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptors and antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2 
receptors. The currently available tablet formulation for daily administration has been investigated for 
the treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders, including those with TD, in a few 
uncontrolled trials. Most used agents do not have an approved indication in TD, including 
antipsychotics. Pimozide, the most extensively used does not have an indication in TD in several 
countries. Haloperidol is also used, and more recently risperidone and ziprasidone have also been 
used. The use is usually based upon small short term non controlled clinical trials or case descriptions. 
Antipsychotic safety profile often preclude its widespread and long term use. 
Within  this  application,  the  MAH  submitted  2  completed  paediatric  studies,  31-12-293  and 
031-KOA-0703 conducted in patients (6-18 years) with Tourette's disorder (TD) in accordance to 
article 46 of Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006, as amended: 
 
Trial 31-12-2931: A multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study enrolling 
patients in Hungary, Italy, Canada, and US to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fixed dose once daily 
oral aripiprazole in children and adolescents with Tourette’s disorder; 
 
Trial  031-KOA-07032:  A  randomised,  double-blind,  dose-adjustment,  placebo-controlled 
study  conducted  in  Korea  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aripiprazole  in  children  and 
adolescents with chronic Tic disorders or Tourette’s disorder. 
On the basis of these data, the MAH proposed to update the SmPC information for Abilify. 
2.2.1 Methods – analysis of data submitted 
2.2.1.1  
Study Design 
Although of similar overall design, there were differences in the dosing schemes and titration 
schedules for the 2 trials. In both trials, all subjects were randomly assigned to active treatment or 
placebo. Trial 31-12-293 evaluated fixed dosing in an 8-week trial conducted globally and Trial 
031-KOA-0703 evaluated flexible dosing in a 10-week trial conducted in Korea. All subjects assigned 
to active treatment in both trials began with a dose of 2 mg/day. 
Trial 31-12-293 
Trial 31-12-293 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, outpatient 
trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of fixed dose oral aripiprazole once daily tablets in 
children and adolescents with Tourette’s disorder.

Subjects were male or female children or adolescents between 7 and 17 years of age (inclusive) who 
met the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision 
(DSM IV TR) diagnostic criteria for Tourette’s disorder  (as confirmed by the Kiddie Schedule for 
Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia   Present and Lifetime Version (K SADS PL), including the 
Diagnostic Supplement 5 [Substance Abuse and Other Diseases, i.e., Tic Disorders]), had a total Tic 
score ≥  20 on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) at screening and baseline (randomisation), 
and who, along with his/her caregiver, and the investigator all agreed that the presenting tic 
symptoms caused impairment in the subject's normal routines (e.g., academic achievement, 
occupational functioning, social activities, and/or relationships).  Subjects did not have neurologic 
conditions that may have abnormal movements (e.g., Transient Tic disorder, Huntington’s disease) 
and had no history of psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder.  Subjects were in good physical health as 
determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical 
examinations. The eligibility criteria were developed to represent the patient population that would 
most likely be treated with aripiprazole tablets.  The subjects enrolled allowed for the appropriate 
evaluation of efficacy in the intended population. 
The trial consisted of 2 distinct phases: Pre-treatment phase consisting of a screening and washout 
(when applicable) period, followed by 8 week treatment phase starting with the baseline visit (Day 0). 
There was also a follow up period (30 ± 3 days) for subjects who discontinued from the trial or who did 
not roll over into an open label follow-on trial (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & 
Commercialization, Inc. (OPDC) protocol 31 12 294). 
Subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to low or high dose aripiprazole or placebo.  For subjects who 
weighed < 50 kg at baseline, low and high doses of aripiprazole were 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively.  
For subjects who weighed ≥  50 kg at baseline, low and high doses of aripiprazole were 10 and 20 
mg/day, respectively.  All subjects randomised to the aripiprazole groups began treatment at a 2 
mg/day dose, with the dose titrated to 5 mg/day after 2 days.  The dose was titrated to achieve the 
randomised dose according to a pre-specified titration scheme.  All subjects reached their randomised 
dose by Week 3 and remained on that randomised dose.  If a subject did not tolerate the randomised 
dose during the titration period (before first dose at Week 3), he/she was discontinued from the trial.  
If a subject did not tolerate the randomised dose, the dose may have been decreased one time after 
Week 3, to the next lower dose level or to 2 mg/day for the 5 mg/day group.  Subjects who did not 
tolerate the reduced dose were discontinued from the trial.

Trial 031-KOA-0703 
Trial 031-KOA-0703 was a randomised, double-blind, dose-adjustment, placebo-controlled study 
conducted in South Korea to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in children and 
adolescents with chronic Tic disorders or Tourette’s disorder.  Subjects were male or female children 
and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years (inclusive) with a current diagnosis of chronic Tic disorders (vocal 
Tic and motor Tic) or Tourette’s disorder according to DSM-IV (using Kiddie-Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present and Lifetime Version-Korean version (K-SADS-PL-K)) requiring 
drug therapy.  Subjects had equal to or greater than 22 in total Tic scores on the Korean version of 
Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (K-YGTSS) at baseline visit.  Subjects were required to be in good 
physical health as determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests, ECG, and physical 
examinations. The eligibility criteria were developed to represent the patient population that would 
most likely be treated with aripiprazole tablets and as such the subjects enrolled allowed for the 
appropriate evaluation of efficacy in the intended population. 
Subjects were randomised to either aripiprazole or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and received double-blind 
study drug for 10 weeks from the randomisation day (Day 1).  All subjects visited hospital every 2 
weeks, and investigators adjusted the study drug dose according to the improvement of Tic 
symptoms and incidence of adverse events.  The dose increase schedule was from 2 mg/day to 5 
mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, and 20 mg/day, and the decision to increase dose was made at each 
2 week visit.  The maximum target dose was 20 mg/day, but it was not mandatory to reach the 
maximum dose.   
The investigator made the final decision on the dose adjustment based on the improvement of Tic 
symptoms (score of the Tourette’s syndrome-Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (TS-CGI-I) 
scale) and adverse events based on the following criteria: a) Criteria for maintaining dose: a score of 
1 or 2 in the TS-CGI-I scale and tolerable adverse event; b) Criteria for increasing dose: a score of ≥  
3 in the TS-CGI-I scale and tolerable adverse event; c)Criteria for reducing dose: in case of an 
intolerable adverse event the dose was decreased to the previous dose or study drug was 
discontinued based at the investigator’s discretion. If the dose was decreased from the previous dose, 
the reduced dose was maintained until the final visit. 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed and evaluated cumulative safety data 
collected at regular intervals to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the trial. 
2.2.1.2  
Statistical Methods 
Trial 31-12-293 
For Trial 31-12-293, the ITT Sample was the primary dataset for all efficacy analyses, and was 
composed of all subjects randomly assigned to investigational medicinal product (IMP). The statistical 
analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints were performed by using a mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) linear model under the assumption that missing data were missing at 
random (MAR). The MMRM model included terms of treatment (aripiprazole low-dose, aripiprazole 
high-dose, or placebo), region, body weight group, visit week, and treatment-by-week interactions as 
fixed categorical effects, and fixed covariate of either baseline YGTSS TTS (for the primary endpoint) 
or the Clinical Global Impression severity (CGI-S) scale score, with a single unstructured covariance 
matrix assumed for all treatment groups. Subjects without a post-baseline measurement of YGTSS 
TTS were not included in the MMRM analysis, but their data were analysed using imputed 
post-baseline data in the sensitivity analyses assuming a missing not at random (MNAR) scenario 
(described subsequently in this section). The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity 
in testing 2 comparisons (low-dose aripiprazole versus placebo and high-dose aripiprazole versus 
placebo) of the primary endpoint (YGTSS TTS) and key secondary endpoint (CGI-I at endpoint), and 
form 2 families of null hypotheses in the stated order. The rules following the Hochberg procedure 
Assessment report  
EMA/557557/2014 
Page 6/21 
 
  
  
were as follows: if the maximum of the 2 p-values was < 0.05, then both hypotheses were rejected 
with claim for statistical significance; otherwise, if the smaller of the 2 p-values was < 0.025, then the 
hypothesis with the smaller p-value was rejected with claim for statistical significance. Both null 
hypotheses for the primary endpoint must have been rejected at the 0.05 significance level in order 
to test the 2 null hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses of the primary and 
key secondary endpoints were performed to assess the impact of missing data being MNAR and to 
understand the impact of stepdown dosing. 
Missing data in this trial could potentially have arisen from the mechanism of MNAR. In order to 
understand the impact on the trial findings of different treatments for missing data under the MNAR 
assumption, if at least 1 aripiprazole dose group demonstrated statistically significant efficacy, 
sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were carried out by multiple imputations for the ITT 
Sample. 
Trial 031-KOA-0703 
For Trial 031-KOA-0703, the ITT Sample was the primary dataset for all efficacy analyses, and was 
composed of all randomized subjects. Assumption of normality was checked before carrying out 
statistical testing on continuous variables. If the normality assumption was met, parametric methods 
(e.g., paired t-test, 2-sample t-test, or analysis of variance were used). If the normality assumption 
was not met, nonparametric methods (e.g., Kruskal Wallis test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, or 
Wilcoxon rank sum test) were used. All tests were presented at the 2-tailed, 0.05 level of significance. 
Missing data were imputed via last-observation carried- forward (LOCF) analysis, and included results 
for 2 subjects in the placebo group for whom the only post-baseline visit was the ET visit. 
2.2.2 Results 
2.2.2.1  
Patient Population 
Trial 31-12-293 
A total of 133 subjects were randomised in the trial to either low dose aripiprazole (44 subjects of 
whom 28 and 16 received aripiprazole 5 and 10 mg, respectively), high dose aripiprazole (45 subjects 
of whom 30 and 15 received aripiprazole 10 and 20 mg, respectively) or placebo (44 subjects).  All 
randomised subjects received study drug.  A total of 119 subjects completed the trial (i.e., completed 
the Week 8 Visit).  The mean age of randomised subjects was 11.1, 11.8, and 11.6 years in the low  
and high dose aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively.  Overall, the baseline demographic 
characteristics were similar between the low  and high dose aripiprazole and placebo groups with the 
exception of a higher percentage of Black or African American subjects in the aripiprazole low dose 
group, and a lower mean body weight at baseline in the low dose aripiprazole group compared with 
the other groups. The intention to treat (ITT) Sample included a higher percentage of males than 
females in each of the low  and high dose aripiprazole and placebo groups:  81.8%, 77.8%, and 
75.0%, respectively.  The mean weight and body mass index (BMI) of randomised subjects were 44.2 
kg and 19.5 kg/m2, 47.4 kg and 20.3 kg/m2, 47.8 kg and 20.1 kg/m2, respectively, in the low  and 
high dose aripiprazole and placebo groups.  Baseline characteristics were also similar between the low  
and high dose aripiprazole and placebo groups with regards to disease status.  The baseline mean 
total YGTSS of randomised subjects was 61.2, 62.5, and 62.8 in the low  and high dose aripiprazole 
and placebo groups, respectively.  The baseline mean Clinical Global Impressions Scale Tourette’s 
Syndrome (CGI TS) Severity Score was 4.3, 4.1, and 4.2 in the low  and high dose aripiprazole and 
placebo groups, respectively.

Trial 031-KOA-0703 
A total of 61 subjects were randomised to either placebo (29 subjects) or aripiprazole (32 subjects).  
All randomised subjects, except for one in the aripiprazole arm who withdrew due to protocol 
deviation, were treated with the study drug.  Demographics were similar across treatment groups.  
The mean age was 10.95 years (SD ± 2.72; range, 6 to 18 years). All 61 subjects (100.00%) had 
current psychiatric histories of Tourette’s disorder.  There were no statistically significant differences 
between the aripiprazole and placebo groups with regards to other past psychiatric histories or other 
current psychiatric histories. 54 subjects (25 placebo, 29 aripiprazole) completed the trial and the 
disposition of study completion status did not differ between the two groups (p=0.6988). 
2.2.2.2  
Efficacy results 
Trial 31-12-293 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) in the YGTSS TTS.  The 
treatment difference between the low-dose aripiprazole and placebo groups (-6.26) was statistically 
significant (p = 0.0020) for the primary efficacy variable (change from baseline to Week 8 in YGTSS 
TTS); the treatment difference between the high-dose aripiprazole and placebo groups (-9.85) was 
also statistically significant (p < 0.0001), based on a mixed effect repeated measure model.  
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint corroborated these results. 
The onset of a treatment difference between the aripiprazole and placebo groups occurred as early as 
Week 1 in YGTSS TTS (see below).  Separation in the treatment difference between the high-dose 
aripiprazole and placebo groups increased from Weeks 2 through 8, and between the low-dose 
aripiprazole and placebo groups from Weeks 4 through 8.  The high-dose aripiprazole group 
demonstrated a numerically greater treatment effect than the low-dose aripiprazole group at each 
time point in the trial.  The treatment difference between the aripiprazole (low and high doses) and 
placebo groups was statistically significant at all-time points except at Week 2 in the low-dose 
aripiprazole group. 
The LS mean changes from baseline in the YGTSS TTS score by week are shown below:

Table: Analysis of Change from Baseline to Week 8 in YGTSS TTS for Trial 31-12-293, MMRM (ITT 
Sample) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed for the following subgroups: a) Age of 7 to 12 years 
versus 13 to 17 years at screening; b) Region of North America (US and Canada) versus the Rest of 
the World; c) Race of white versus Other; d) Baseline YGTSS TTS of < 30 versus  30. 
The treatment effect among these subgroups was similar to the trial population, except in the “Other” 
race and the 13-to-17 year-old subgroups for the low-dose aripiprazole versus placebo groups and 
except in the “Other” race and the “Rest of the World” subgroups for the high-dose aripiprazole versus 
placebo groups.  However, the small sample sizes in these subgroups do not allow reliable inferences 
to be made.

Secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint was the mean CGI-TS Change Score at endpoint (change score obtained 
from CGI-TS improvement scale assessment).  The treatment difference between the low-dose 
aripiprazole and placebo groups (-1.03) was statistically significant (p = 0.0001) for the key 
secondary efficacy variable; the treatment difference between the high-dose aripiprazole and placebo 
groups (-1.02) was also statistically significant (p = 0.0002), based on a mixed effect repeated 
measure model.  Sensitivity analyses of the key secondary endpoint confirm these results. The 
treatment difference between the aripiprazole (low and high doses) and placebo groups was 
statistically significant at all-time points in the trial and was observed at Week 1.  The separation in 
the treatment difference continued to Week 2 and increased from there through Week 8.  The 
treatment effect of the low- and high-dose aripiprazole groups was comparable at each time point in 
the trial. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were the mean change from baseline to endpoint in Total YGTSS 
Score; mean change from baseline to endpoint in CGI-TS Severity Score; response rates (clinical 
response was defined as > 25% improvement from baseline to endpoint in the YGTSS TTS or a 
CGI-TS Change Score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved] at endpoint); and treatment 
discontinuation rates.  Results of the Total YGTSS Score and the CGI-TS Severity Score also 
corroborated the primary efficacy results.  The treatment difference between the low-dose 
aripiprazole and placebo groups for Total YGTSS Score (-13.26) and CGI-TS Severity Score (-0.80) at 
Week 8 was statistically significant, p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0010, respectively.  The treatment 
difference between the high-dose aripiprazole and placebo groups for Total YGTSS Score (-19.37) and 
CGI-TS Severity Score (-0.92) at Week 8 was statistically significant, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, 
respectively. 
The response ratio (95% CI) (response ratio > 1 favours aripiprazole) using observed case (OC) data 
at Week 8 in the low- and high-dose aripiprazole groups, versus the placebo group, was 1.36 (0.98, 
1.88) and 1.61 (1.20, 2.16), respectively.  The response ratio for the low-dose aripiprazole group 
compared with the placebo group was not statistically significant; the response ratio for the high-dose 
aripiprazole group compared with the placebo group was statistically significant (p = 0.0014).  
Response was observed as early as Week 1 in both aripiprazole groups (for OC) and, except for the 
low-dose aripiprazole group at Week 8, was maintained throughout the trial. 
Trial 031-KOA-0703 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was mean change of total Tic scores in K-YGTSS from randomisation (Visit 2) to 
the final visit at Week 10 (Visit 7).  For the intention to treat (ITT) analysis the mean total Tic score 
was decreased from 29.48 (±5.60) at baseline to 19.86 (±9.54) at Visit 7 for the placebo arm, 
showing a decrease by -9.62 (±8.83).  For aripiprazole, the mean total Tic score showed a greater 
decrease then placebo, changing from 28.34 (±5.51) at baseline to 13.55 (±9.12) at Visit 7, a 
decrease by -g14.97 (±8.42).  The difference in the change from baseline to Visit 7 between the 
treatment groups was statistically significant (p=0.0196). The full analysis set (FAS) analysis showed 
identical results with the ITT analysis, other than a small difference in the summary statistics of 
baseline measurement in the aripiprazole group, due to the ITT data set having only one extra subject 
compared to the FAS, who was randomised but withdrawn prior to the study drug administration and 
for who post-administration efficacy data were not available. For the per protocol (PP) analysis the 
mean total Tic score was 28.19 (±5.72) at baseline and 17.24 (±7.44) at Visit 7 for placebo, showing 
a decrease by -10.95 (±7.89).  For aripiprazole, the mean total Tic score showed a greater decrease 
than for placebo, changing from 28.35 (±4.65) at baseline to13.87 (±7.27) at Visit 7, a decrease by 
-14.48 (±7.76)].  However, the difference in the change from baseline to Visit 7 between treatment 
groups was not statistically significant.  One possible reason for this difference in statistical 
Assessment report

significance may be the exclusion of subjects from the PP population, who had shown a poor response 
while taking placebo. In addition, the same analysis was performed on the change from baseline to 
each visit (Visit 3 to 6) and the significance of the change from baseline to each visit in each treatment 
group was also assessed.  ANCOVA was carried out on the difference in change from baseline to Visit

Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percent change of total Tic scores in K-YGTSS from 
randomisation to the final visit, response rate in TS-CGI-I at the final visit, partial response rate in 
TS-CGI-I at the final visit, and mean change of Tourette’s syndrome-Clinical Global 
Impression-Severity (TS-CGI-S) score. For the analysis of percent change of total Tic scores in 
K-YGTSS from randomisation (Visit 2) to the final visit (Week 10, Visit 7) the mean percent change 
was -33.00% (±27.83) for placebo and -52.86% (±27.83) for aripiprazole.  The difference between 
the treatment groups was statistically significant (p-=0.0077). The analysis of response rate 
(percentage of subjects with score 1 or 2) in TS-CGI-I at the final visit showed a higher response rate 
for aripiprazole, with 21 subjects (65.63%) in the aripiprazole group and 13 subjects (44.83%) in 
placebo group being responders. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the 
response rate between the treatment groups. For the analysis of partial response rate (percentage of 
subjects with score 3) in TS-CGI-I, aripiprazole showed a higher partial response rate as 6 subjects 
(18.75%) in the aripiprazole group and 4 subjects (13.79%) in the placebo group were partial 
responders.  However, the difference in the response rate between the treatment groups was not 
statistically significant. For mean change of TS-CGI-S score from randomisation (Visit 2) to the final 
visit (Visit 7) a decrease, by -1.10 (±1.14) was seen in the placebo group.  For the aripiprazole group, 
the decrease was greater, by -1.71 (±1.30).  The difference in the change from baseline to Visit 7 
between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p=0.0321).

Paediatric Subjects with Tourette's Disorder (ITT Samples) 
2.2.3 Discussion 
Trial 31-12-293 
Trial was powered to test for a 5-point difference in change from baseline of YGTSS TTS between 
placebo and any of the treatment groups (defined as clinically meaningful improvement). In Trial 
31-12-293, the LS mean change from baseline to Week 8 in YGTSS TTS showed statistical significance 
for both low-dose (−13.35; p = 0.0020) and high-dose (−16.94; p < 0.0001) aripiprazole compared 
with placebo (−7.09). The difference in treatment effect observed as early as Week 1 was sustained 
through the course of the trial, with a statistically significant treatment difference in favour of 
aripiprazole for the high-dose group at each time-point, and for the low-dose group at each time-point 
except at Week 2. These data were derived from an MMRM linear model that assumes the mechanism 
of missing data is MAR. Results of both MNAR scenarios revealed that the method used to impute 
missing data did not change the overall conclusion of the primary analysis. The step-down dose 
sensitivity analysis performed according to the dose to which subjects were stepped down showed 
that the treatment effect for YGTSS TTS remained statistically significant for both low-dose (p = 
0.0009) and high-dose (p < 0.0001) aripiprazole compared with placebo. Seven subjects were 
stepped down to the next lower dose than their randomized dose: 4 subjects randomized to receive 
Assessment report  
EMA/557557/2014 
Page 12/21 
 
  
  
 
10 mg and 1 subject randomized to receive 20 mg in the high-dose aripiprazole group, and 1 subject 
each randomized to receive 5 or 10 mg in the low-dose aripiprazole group. 
The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses demonstrated that both low- and high-dose 
aripiprazole are statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of tics associated with Tourette’s 
disorder in children and adolescents (aged 7-17 years). The results of the other secondary efficacy 
analyses corroborate the primary efficacy results. 
Trial 031-KOA-0703 
For primary efficacy analysis, the ITT, FAS and PP analysis results showed that the total Tic score 
decreased by visit and the differences from baseline were statistically significant at all visits in both 
treatment groups (paired t-test).  The mean decreases were greater for aripiprazole than for placebo 
at all visits, and of these, the treatment difference was significant at Visit 3 and 5, in the ITT and FAS 
analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint, mean change of total Tic scores in K-YGTSS, and two of the 
secondary efficacy endpoints (percent change of total Tic scores in K-YGTSS and mean change of 
TS-CGI-S score from randomisation to the final visit) showed a statistically significant difference 
between treatment groups, with aripiprazole being superior to placebo. 
Overall efficacy conclusions 
The population in both trials was small, particularly Trial 031-KOA-0703, and the primary efficacy 
endpoint of the “low dose” aripiprazole arm, was not significantly different from placebo. This “low 
dose” is equal to the minimum adult maintenance dose for schizophrenia, and therefore is not really 
a “low dose”. 
No controlled trials have been conducted to assess the long-term efficacy and/or tolerance effects of 
aripiprazole for the treatment of tics associated with TD in paediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. 
Clinical meaningfulness of the differences was not established a priori nor was discussed afterwards. 
It is worth of note that the placebo effect was about half of the average effect of both aripiprazole 
arms  in  trial  31-12-293  and  even  more  significant  on  trial  031-KOA-0703.  Moreover,  the  main 
endpoint did not truly assess improvement of disability caused by TD. 
Another important aspect is the fact that both studies were very short in treatment duration, and 
there  is  no  available  follow  up  data.  Considering  that  TD  is  a  chronic  disorder,  there  is  no  robust 
evidence  on  the  maintenance  of  effect  on  TD.  In  this  respect,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  SmPC 
approved  information  for  “Irritability  associated  with  autistic  disorder  in  paediatric  patients”  was 
based on more clinically significant data. 
In  conclusion,  MAH  did  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  of  clinical  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  for  the 
treatment of TD to support the initial proposed SmPC wording for section 5.1. See further details in 
section 2.4. 
2.3  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.3.1 Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The primary analysis of safety was performed on data for the individual TD trials (Trials 31-12-293, 
031-KOA-0703, and 31-12-294. 
For the purposes of this submission, a TEAE was defined as an AE that began after the start of IMP or 
an AE that continued from baseline (before dosing) and that became serious or drug-related; resulted 
in death; or led to discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IMP. An AE with an unknown start date 
Assessment report  
EMA/557557/2014 
Page 13/21 
 
  
  
was considered a TEAE. For completed trials, AEs with an onset more than 30 days after the last day 
of IMP were excluded from the summary tables. 
Breslow-Day tests for homogeneity were conducted for Trial 31-12-293 on subgroups of  subjects 
based on age, gender, and race for TEAEs with an incidence ≥  5% in subjects receiving aripiprazole 
and ≥  2 times the incidence in subjects receiving placebo. The incidence of AESIs was summarized for 
the TD trials. Searches of the AE databases for specified preferred terms according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 16.0, were conducted to identify subjects with 
AESIs in the following categories: EPS-related events, suicidality-related events, weight gain-related 
events,  prolactin-related  events,  hyperglycemia-  or  diabetes-related  events  and 
lipid 
parameter-related events. 
2.3.2 Results 
Overall Extent of Exposure 
In Trial 31-12-293, a total of 89 subjects were exposed to aripiprazole: 44 and 45 subjects in the low- 
and high-dose aripiprazole groups, respectively. The largest proportion of subjects in the low-dose 
aripiprazole group (52.3%) was exposed for 50 to 56 days, and in the high-dose aripiprazole group, 
the largest proportion (44.4%) was exposed for > 56 days (CSR 31-12-293 CT-7.2). During the 50- 
to 56-day interval, the average daily dose was 4.8 and 9.5 mg for the low- and high-weight subjects 
in the low-dose aripiprazole group, respectively, and 9.0 and 17.6 mg for the low- and high-weight 
subjects in the high-dose aripiprazole group, respectively. 
In Trial 031-KOA-0703, a total of 32 subjects were exposed to aripiprazole. The mean total duration 
of aripiprazole administration was 68.6 days, and the mean average daily dose of aripiprazole was 6.5 
mg. 
Deaths 
No deaths have been reported during the two trials included in this submission. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No pregnancies were reported in subjects the two clinical trials included in this submission. 
2.3.2.1  
Rates of AEs, SAEs, and Discontinuation of Therapy 
Trial 31-12-293 
A total of 133 subjects were included in the safety analysis:  44, 45 and 44 subjects in the low dose 
aripiprazole,  high  dose  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.    The  largest  proportion  of 
subjects in the low dose (52.3%) and high dose (44.4%) aripiprazole groups was exposed for 50 to 56 
days and > 56 days, respectively.  In the low and high dose aripiprazole groups, 43.2% and 44.4% of 
subjects, respectively, were exposed to aripiprazole for ≥ 8 weeks (i.e., ≥ 56 days).  No subject in the 
trial received > 30 mg/day of aripiprazole. 
No  serious  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (TEAEs)  were  reported.    Discontinuation  of  trial 
medication due to a TEAE occurred in 9 subjects:  1 subject (2.3%) each, in the low dose aripiprazole 
and placebo groups and 7 subjects (15.6%) in the high dose aripiprazole group (Subject 530S3094 in 
the  low  dose  [5  mg]  aripiprazole  group  was  discontinued  trial  medication  due  to  severe 
somnambulism,  but  completed  the  trial).  The  trial  completion  rate  was  95.5%  in  the  low  dose 
aripiprazole,  77.8%  in  the  high  dose  aripiprazole,  and  95.5%  in  the  placebo  groups.    The 
discontinuation  ratio  was  statistically  significant  for  the  high  dose  aripiprazole  (22.2%)  group

compared  with  the  placebo  group,  due  predominantly  to  the  discontinuation  rate  of  subjects  who 
weighed < 50 kg and received aripiprazole 10 mg. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in the low  and high dose aripiprazole groups was 65.9% and 75.6%, 
respectively, and 40.9% in the placebo group.  The most frequently reported TEAEs that occurred in 
the low  and high dose aripiprazole groups (with an incidence of ≥ 5% in both aripiprazole groups) 
were  sedation  (18.2%  and  8.9%,  respectively),  somnolence  (11.4%  and  15.6%,  respectively), 
increased  appetite  (9.1%  and  6.7%,  respectively),  fatigue  (6.8%  and  15.6%),  and  headache, 
nasopharyngitis, and nausea (6.8% and 8.9%, respectively, each). 
In  general,  TEAEs  with  an  incidence  of  ≥  5%  in  either  aripiprazole  group  were  experienced  by  a 
greater proportion of subjects who weighed < 50 kg than subjects who weighed ≥ 50 kg.  In the low 
dose aripiprazole group, the exceptions were sedation and somnolence in < 50 kg subjects (14.3% 
and 10.7%, respectively) versus ≥ 50 kg subjects (25.0% and 12.5%, respectively).  In the high dose 
aripiprazole group, the exceptions were akathisia and headache in < 50 kg subjects (3.3% and 6.7%, 
respectively)  versus  ≥  50  kg  subjects  (13.3%  for  each).    Most  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
intensity in the aripiprazole and placebo groups.  There was 1 severe TEAE of somnambulism in the 
low dose aripiprazole group; 4 severe TEAEs of lethargy, sedation, somnolence, and insomnia in the 
high dose aripiprazole group; and no severe TEAEs reported in the placebo group.  TEAEs considered 
by the investigator as potentially causally related to trial medication were reported for 20 (45.5%), 28 
(62.2%),  and  10  (22.7%)  subjects  in  the  low    and  high  dose  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively. 
There were 1 (2.3%), 6 (13.3%), and no subjects in the low  and high dose aripiprazole and placebo 
groups, respectively, who experienced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) related TEAEs.  EPS rating 
scales (SARS (Simpson-Angus Rating Scale), BARS (Barnes-Akathisia Rating Scale), and Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)) were assessed at baseline before dosing and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 
6 and 8.  The treatment difference was statistically significant only between the high dose aripiprazole 
and placebo groups for the EPS rating scales of SAS (p = 0.0357) and AIMS (p = 0.0382).   
There  were  no  TEAEs  related  to  prolactin,  hyperglycaemia  and  diabetes,  lipid  parameters,  or 
overdose. 
While 2 subjects noted emergent suicidal ideation and 4 subjects had worsening suicidal ideation per 
responses to the C SSRS, no suicidal behaviour or ideation with a specific plan was observed and no 
suicide  related  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported.  Weight  gain-related  TEAEs  in  the  low-  and 
high-dose  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups  were  reported  for  5  of  44  subjects  (11.4%),  3  of  45 
subjects  (6.7%),  and  1  of  44  subjects  (2.3%),  respectively.  Potentially  clinically  relevant  weight 
abnormalities (defined as a change of ≥  7% from baseline) were seen at a higher incidence in the 
low-dose aripiprazole group (8/44 subjects; 18.2%) than in the high-dose aripiprazole and placebo 
groups (4/45 subjects; 9.3% and 4/44 subjects; 9.1%, respectively). 
Additional  scales  were  used  to  measure  any  increase  in  attention  deficit/hyperactivity  disorder 
(ADHD) Inattentive and ADHD Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms, obsessive compulsive symptoms, 
oppositional defiant symptoms, depression, and anxiety symptoms.  These included the Swanson, 
Nolan, and Pelham IV (SNAP IV) Rating Scale, Children’s Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY 
BOCS), Children’s Depression Rating Scale   Revised (CDRS R), and Paediatric Anxiety Rating Scale 
(PARS).  No statistically significant difference was observed between the aripiprazole (low and high 
doses) and placebo groups, except on the SNAP IV, where high dose aripiprazole showed significant 
improvement  over  placebo  in  inattention  subscale  score  (p  =  0.0027),  hyperactivity/impulsivity 
subscale score (p = 0.0352), and attention deficit disorder (ADD)/ADHD subscale total score (p = 
0.0048).

Trial 031-KOA-0703 
A total of 60 subjects were included in the safety analysis; 28 in the placebo group and 32 in the 
aripiprazole  group.    Extent  of  drug  exposure  was  estimated  by  adding  the  amount  of  drug 
administration of all visits.  The mean total amount of study medication taken during the study was 
530.86  mg  (±239.31)  for  placebo  and  455.94  mg  (±220.39)  for  aripiprazole,  with  no  statistically 
significant  difference  between  the  treatment  groups.    The  mean  total  duration  of  study  drug 
administration was also not significantly different between treatment groups (63.75 days (±19.09) 
for placebo and 68.63 days (±10.02) for aripiprazole).  No subjects withdrew from the study owing to 
TEAEs. 
No deaths or suicidal ideation events were reported.  All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, with 
no severe TEAEs being reported.  TEAEs were experienced by 20 subjects (71.43%, 57 events) out of 
the 28 in the placebo group and 24 subjects (75.00%, 56 events) out of the 32 in the aripiprazole 
group, demonstrating no difference in the incidence rate between the treatment groups. However, 
one subject (Subject 003-0009) experienced an SAE of hydrocephalus during the screening period. 
The  most  common  TEAEs  reported  at  an  incidence  rate  of  ≥   5%  were  akathisia  (4/  28  subjects, 
14.29%) and dizziness (4/ 28 subjects, 14.29%) in the placebo group, and nausea (6/ 32 subjects, 
18.75%) and headache (5/ 32 subjects, 15.63%) followed by sedation (4/ 32 subjects, 12.50%), 
somnolence  (4/  32  subjects,  12.50%)  and  nasopharyngitis  (4/  32  subjects,  12.50%)  in  the 
aripiprazole group.  Seven TEAEs in the placebo group and 4 TEAEs in the aripiprazole group were 
moderate, and the rest of TEAEs were mild. 
No SAEs were reported  during randomised treatment and there were no other significant adverse 
events, including AEs that lead to withdrawal from the study.  
EPS-related  side  effects  were  evaluated  with  the  SARS,  BARS,  and  AIMS  scales.    There  was  no 
significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo groups in mean change from baseline to Week 
10 (Visit 7) in total SARS, BARS and AIMS scores.  Each SARS, BARS and AIMS score item was also 
analysed by visit.  No statistical significance was detected for change from baseline to each visit and 
for difference in these changes between the aripiprazole and placebo groups.  
Treatment-emergent  EPS  and  EPS  related  TEAEs  were  reported  in  7  placebo  and  5  aripiprazole 
treated  patients.    Akathisia  occurred  in  4  (14.29%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  and  1  (3.13%) 
subject  in  the  aripiprazole  group.    Extrapyramidal  disorder  occurred  in  1  (3.57%)  subject  in  the 
placebo  group  and  3  (9.38%)  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  group.  Dystonia  occurred  in  2  (7.14%) 
placebo  subjects  and  bradykinesia in 1  (3.13%)  aripiprazole  subject.  No  weight  gain  or loss  were 
reported. Notwithstanding, Aripiprazole-treated subjects had a mean (± SD) increase from baseline 
in body weight of 1.62 ± 2.02 kg, while subjects in the placebo group had a mean (± SD) increase 
from baseline of 0.20 ± 1.84 kg (CSR 031-KOA-0703 Table 13.47). Nine of 32 subjects (28.1%) in the 
aripiprazole group and 2 of 28 subjects (7.1%) in the placebo group had potentially clinically relevant 
weight gain (≥  7% change from baseline) at Week 10; however, the differences between treatment 
groups were not statistically significant. 
2.3.2.2 Laboratory Assessments, Vital Signs, ECG 
Trial 31-12-293 
No significant findings were shown in clinical laboratory values, vital signs and ECG parameters The 
incidence of potentially clinically relevant laboratory values was similar across the low  and high dose 
aripiprazole and placebo groups, except for creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and fasting glucose, which 
were elevated in 2 subjects each in the low  and high dose aripiprazole groups versus no subjects in 
the placebo group. No clinically relevant mean changes were observed in the insulin or fasting insulin 
results.

The mean change from baseline at Week 8 in the prolactin test results for the low  and high dose 
aripiprazole male groups ( 5.82 [± 7.25] and  4.32 [± 6.84], respectively) and female groups ( 15.58 
[± 23.23] and  5.40 [± 7.78], respectively) was greater than for the placebo group males ( 1.48 [± 
7.88]) and females ( 0.23 [± 4.66]). The mean change from baseline at last visit in the prolactin test 
results for the low dose and high dose aripiprazole male groups ( 5.57 [± 7.29] and  4.22 [± 6.38], 
respectively) and female groups ( 12.31 [± 23.40] and  5.03 [± 7.43], respectively) was greater than 
for the placebo group males ( 1.37 [± 7.66]) and females ( 0.23 [± 4.66]). 
One subject had an increase from baseline in QTc of > 60 msec or a QTc value of > 500 msec.  One 
high dose aripiprazole (10mg) subject had an ECG related TEAE that led to discontinuation of trial 
medication at the investigators discretion and three subjects had potentially clinically relevant ECG 
abnormalities  during  the  trial  (one  low  dose  aripiprazole  (5mg)  and  two  high  dose  aripiprazole 
(20mg)). 
Trial 031-KOA-0703 
There were no apparent safety issues observed with the laboratory test, vital signs, or ECG results.  
No  clinically  relevant  mean  changes  were  observed  in  the  insulin  or  fasting  insulin  results.    No 
clinically meaningful trends were observed for any of the potentially clinically significant laboratory 
test abnormalities.  Any reported abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG parameters 
all appeared to be isolated findings. 
Serum prolactin showed a statistically significant mean change, by -5.85 (±4.93) (Median = -4.45, 
p<0.0001) in the aripiprazole group.  This change was significantly different (p<0.0001) from that in 
placebo group (Mean change = -0.10 (±3.24), Median = 0.10). 
2.3.2.3  
Laboratory Measurements of Special Interest 
Trial 31-12-293 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in any laboratory measurements of 
special interest such as fasting blood levels for triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (cholesterol) 
(HDL-C), glucose and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  
With a potentially clinically relevant weight abnormality defined as a change > 7%, the incidence of a 
weight gain abnormality was higher in the low dose aripiprazole group (8 subjects [18.2%]) than in 
the high dose aripiprazole and placebo groups (4 subjects each [9.3% and 9.1%, respectively]). The 
incidence  of  weight  gain  related  TEAEs,  which  included  events  of  weight  increased  and  increased 
appetite was higher in the low dose aripiprazole group (5 [11.4%] subjects) than in the high dose 
aripiprazole group (3 [6.7%] subjects) and the placebo group (1 [2.3%] subjects).  Two low dose 
aripiprazole (one 10 mg, one 5 mg) subjects had a TEAE of weight increased during the trial. 
Trial 031-KOA-0703 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in any laboratory measurements of 
special interest such as fasting blood levels for triglycerides, HDL-C, glucose and systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure. 
Body weight showed a statistically significant mean change, by 1.62kg (±2.02) (p = 0.0001) in the 
aripiprazole group.  This change was significantly different (p = 0.0102) from that in placebo group 
(Mean change = 0.20 kg (±1.84), p = 0.6070).  BMI showed a statistically significant mean change, 
by  0.45  kg/m2  (±0.86)  (p-value  =  0.0079)  in  aripiprazole  group.    This  change  was  significantly 
different  (p-value  =  0.0243,)  from  that  in  placebo  group  (Mean  change  =  -0.09  kg/m2  [±0.85]).  
Waist circumference also showed a statistically significant mean change, by 1.83 cm (±3.80) (p = 
0.0093) in aripiprazole group.  This change was found significantly different (p = 0.0293) from that in 
placebo group (Mean change = -0.07 cm [±2.90]).  Considering baseline and final BMI, the weight

gain  is  not  considered  excessive,  and  the  weight  gain  may  be  seen  as  a  natural  consequence  of 
symptom relief from Tic disorders or Tourette’s disorder. 
2.3.3 Discussion 
Aripiprazole is known to cause adverse events (AEs), and the most expected in the paediatric age 
range are EPS, weight gain, and somnolence. It was fairly well studied in paediatric bipolar type I 
disorder, which shares common comorbidities like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), 
and  in  these  children,  some  of  the  adverse  events  were  cumulatively  more  evident  after  the  first 
weeks of treatment. Weight gain threshold of >7% increase over baseline must take enough time to 
be attained, and short trials fail to identify this. Of note, the indication “for the treatment up to 12 
weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents” was adopted for 
children aged 13 years and older due to safety issues in children between 10 and 12 years of age.  
Delayed onset adverse events, such as neuroleptic tardive syndrome cannot be identified on such 
short trials. This is particularly important since TD may be a form of tardive disease, and thus the 
patient may improve in the first months or years of treatment, and then worse tics again either in the 
context of worsening of the primary disease or as a new tardive disorder with similar symptoms. 
TD is a spectrum, which range from minor non incapacitating tics to motor and socially disabling tics. 
Safety issues must thus be weighed against efficacy through the entire range of disease severity. It is 
known that different disease populations have different AE profile. With these very short term trials 
the profile of AEs in TD cannot be identified. Adverse events were only followed up for 30 days after 
IMP  stops.  Therefore  there  is  no  data  on  medium  term  or  delayed  adverse  events.  Events  with  a 
cumulative effect such as weight gain were not adequately followed in order to properly weigh their 
safety value. 
2.4 Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  initially  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI)  (deleted  text= 
strikethrough, new text= underlined):  
Section 4.2 
Tics associated with Tourette’s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and adolescents 
6  to  18  years  of  age  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in 
section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Section 5.1 
Tics associated with Tourette’s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) 
The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of Tourette’s disorder was established in one 8-week (7 
to 17 years of age) and one 10-week (6 to 18 years of age), placebo-controlled trials in paediatric 
patients.  In  the  8-week  placebo-controlled  trial,  children  and  adolescents  with  Tourette’s  disorder 
(n=133), received daily doses of placebo or aripiprazole based on weight. Patients < 50 kg started at 
2 mg/day with a target dose of 5 mg/day after 2 days, and were allowed to increase to 10 mg/day if 
they did not achieve optimal control of tics at or after day 7.  Patients weighing ≥ 50 kg, started at 2 
mg/day increased to 5 mg/day after 2 days, with a subsequent increase to a target dose of 10 mg/day 
at day 7 and were allowed weekly increases of 5 mg/day up to 20 mg/day for patients who did not 
achieve optimal control of tics. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically significantly improved scores 
on total tic score (TTS) of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) change from baseline to Week 8 
and on the CGI-I scale compared with placebo in patients with a minimum total tic score on the YGTSS 
scale greater than 20 at baseline. In the 10-week, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescents

with  Tourette’s  disorder  (n=61),  aged  6  to  18  years,  patients  received  daily  doses  of  placebo  or 
aripiprazole, starting at 2 mg/day with increases allowed up to 20 mg/day based on clinical response. 
Aripiprazole demonstrated significantly improved scores on the YGTSS scale compared with placebo. 
The mean daily dose of aripiprazole at the end of 10-week treatment was 6.54 mg/day.  
However, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. The safety profile for these 
two studies remains unchanged compared to approved paediatric indications.  
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the 
proposed wording of the SmPC update for section 5.1 for the following reasons: 
- TD is a broad spectrum syndrome, with some patients experiencing simple and non-bothersome tics 
with no QoL impact, while on the other end of the spectrum patients develop a severe and disabling 
form of disorder. 
- TD may significantly change in symptom intensity in the individual patient. Tics are known to have 
a bimodal distribution, peaking around 8-10 years of age, and with a second less striking peak in the 
60’s. Moreover, tic severity also changes with emotional and environmental stress, to a significant 
extent: children with tics suffer less when on holidays. Therefore trials with up to 10 week duration 
may be considered too short to draw conclusions on efficacy. 
- The tools used to assess TD were adequate, but the Total YGTSS score (Total Yale Global Tic Severity 
Scale Score (Total Tic Severity Score + Impairment) was not the primary endpoint. In fact, only the 
Total Tic Severity Score was used, and therefore the consequence of Tics upon impairment (which is 
what is the most important) was not described. Also, the minimum value of change with clinical 
significance was not set a priori for this score, and thus the magnitude of effect (which was not 
paramount when compared to placebo effect) may not be clinically relevant, particularly considering 
the above aspects of the disease. 
- Aripiprazole is known to cause adverse events (AEs), and the most expected in this age range are 
EPS, weight gain, and somnolence. It was fairly well studied in paediatric bipolar type I disorder, 
which shares common comorbidities like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and in 
these children some of the adverse events were cumulatively more evident after the first weeks of 
treatment. Weight gain threshold of >7% increase over baseline must take enough time to be 
attained, and short trials fail to identify this. Of note, the indication “for the treatment up to 12 weeks 
of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents” was adopted for children 
aged 13 years and older due to safety issues in children between 10 and 12 years of age. 
- Delayed onset adverse events, such as neuroleptic tardive syndrome cannot be identified on such 
short trials. This is particularly important since Tourette may be a form of tardive disease, and thus 
the patient may improve in the first months or years of treatment, and then worse tics again either in 
the context of worsening of the primary disease or as a new tardive disorder with similar symptoms. 
The CHMP therefore requested further amendments to the PI (section 5.1) that were agreed by the 
MAH.  
The final recommended wording was as follows: 
Section 4.2 
Tics associated with Tourette’s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and adolescents 
6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in 
section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

The efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Tourette’s disorder (aripiprazole: 
n = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a 
fixed dose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and 
a starting dose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on 
Total Tic Score on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an 
improvement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to Week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg 
or 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of 
7.09 in the placebo group. 
The  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  in  paediatric  subjects  with  Tourette’s  syndrome  (aripiprazole:  n = 32, 
placebo:  n = 29)  was  also  evaluated  over  a  flexible  dose  range  of  2 mg/day  to  20 mg/day  and  a 
starting dose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 
Korea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. 
Aripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to Week 10 
as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. 
In  both  of  these  short  term  trials,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  efficacy  findings  has  not  been 
established, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and 
the unclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to 
the efficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk 
balance 
TD is a disorder with a broad spectrum of symptoms and disability. Its continuously modifying clinical 
expression is particularly challenging for the treating physician, but also for clinical investigation and 
the attempt to design adequate clinical trials to address the subject. 
Reference literature frequently describes antipsychotics as agents to treat motor symptoms of TD, but 
most agents do not have a specific indication on TD or tics. Antipsychotics as a group are broadly 
described as possessing an effect of sufficient magnitude to be used in TD, but there are no specific 
recommendations for titration or drug adjustment, nor evidence of maintenance of effect. 
Adverse events of antipsychotics are also of particular concern, particularly when to be used on 
paediatric TD population, who are not as severely disabled as schizophrenic or bipolar adolescents, 
and most important are younger than the pediatric groups for whom aripiprazole has an indication. 
The clinical trials of aripiprazole in children with TD provided useful data for healthcare professionals, 
for which no atypical antipsychotic agent is approved. The CHMP concluded that the addition of such 
information in the SmPC was considered acceptable, taking into consideration the knowledge about 
the disease, the limited efficacy data of aripiprazole on TD - particularly regarding maintenance data 
and the lack of long term safety data, especially for a sustained treatment. 
The benefit-risk balance of Abilify remains positive in the authorised indications.

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Amvuttra 25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each pre-filled syringe contains vutrisiran sodium equivalent to 25 mg vutrisiran in 0.5 mL solution. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection (injection). 
Clear, colourless-to-yellow solution (pH of approximately 7; osmolality 210 to 390 mOsm/kg). 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Amvuttra is indicated for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR 
amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated under the supervision of a physician knowledgeable in the management of 
amyloidosis. Treatment should be started as early as possible in the disease course to prevent the 
accumulation of disability.  
Posology 
The recommended dose of Amvuttra is 25 mg administered via subcutaneous injection once every 
3 months. 
Vitamin A supplementation at approximately, but not exceeding, 2 500 IU to 3 000 IU vitamin A per 
day is advised for patients treated with Amvuttra (see section 4.4). 
The decision to continue treatment in those patients whose disease progresses to stage 3 
polyneuropathy should be taken at the discretion of the physician based on the overall benefit and risk 
assessment. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, Amvuttra should be administered as soon as possible. Dosing should be resumed 
every 3 months, from the most recently administered dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1 x upper 
limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 1 x ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 
1.5 x ULN and any AST). Vutrisiran has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment and should only be used in these patients if the anticipated clinical benefit outweighs the 
potential risk (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2). Vutrisiran has not been studied in 
patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease and should only be used in these 
patients if the anticipated clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Amvuttra in children or adolescents < 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Amvuttra is for subcutaneous use only. Amvuttra should be administered by a healthcare professional. 
This medicinal product is ready-to-use and for single-use only.  
Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. Do not use if discoloured or if 
particles are present. 
Prior to administration, if stored cold, the pre-filled syringe should be allowed to warm by leaving 
carton at room temperature for about 30 minutes. 
• 
The subcutaneous injection should be administered into one of the following sites: the abdomen, 
thighs, or upper arms. Amvuttra should not be injected into scar tissue or areas that are 
reddened, inflamed, or swollen. 
If injecting into the abdomen, the area around the navel should be avoided. 
• 
4.3  Contraindications 
Severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Vitamin A deficiency  
By reducing serum transthyretin (TTR) protein, Amvuttra treatment leads to a decrease in serum 
vitamin A (retinol) levels (see section 5.1). Serum vitamin A levels below the lower limit of normal 
should be corrected and any ocular symptoms or signs due to vitamin A deficiency should be 
evaluated prior to initiation of treatment with Amvuttra. 
Patients receiving Amvuttra should take oral supplementation of approximately, but not exceeding, 
2 500 IU to 3 000 IU vitamin A per day to reduce the potential risk of ocular symptoms due to 
vitamin A deficiency. Ophthalmological assessment is recommended if patients develop ocular 
symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, including reduced night vision or night blindness, 
persistent dry eyes, eye inflammation, corneal inflammation or ulceration, corneal thickening or 
corneal perforation. 
During the first 60 days of pregnancy, both too high or too low vitamin A levels may be associated 
with an increased risk of foetal malformation. Therefore, pregnancy should be excluded before 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initiating Amvuttra and women of childbearing potential should practise effective contraception (see 
section 4.6). If a woman intends to become pregnant, Amvuttra and vitamin A supplementation should 
be discontinued and serum vitamin A levels should be monitored and have returned to normal before 
conception is attempted. Serum vitamin A levels may remain reduced for more than 12 months after 
the last dose of Amvuttra.  
In the event of an unplanned pregnancy, Amvuttra should be discontinued (see section 4.6). No 
recommendation can be given whether to continue or discontinue vitamin A supplementation during 
the first trimester of an unplanned pregnancy. If vitamin A supplementation is continued, the daily 
dose should not exceed 3 000 IU per day, due to the lack of data supporting higher doses. Thereafter, 
vitamin A supplementation of 2 500 IU to 3 000 IU per day should be resumed in the second and third 
trimesters if serum vitamin A levels have not yet returned to normal, because of the increased risk of 
vitamin A deficiency in the third trimester. 
It is not known whether vitamin A supplementation in pregnancy will be sufficient to prevent 
vitamin A deficiency if the pregnant female continues to receive Amvuttra. However, increasing 
vitamin A supplementation to above 3 000 IU per day during pregnancy is unlikely to correct plasma 
retinol levels due to the mechanism of action of Amvuttra and may be harmful to the mother and 
foetus. 
Sodium content  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical interaction studies have been performed. Vutrisiran is not expected to cause interactions or 
to be affected by inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, or to modulate the activity of 
transporters. Therefore, vutrisiran is not expected to have clinically significant interactions with other 
medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Treatment with Amvuttra reduces serum levels of vitamin A. Both too high or too low vitamin A 
levels may be associated with an increased risk of foetal malformation. Therefore, pregnancy should 
be excluded before initiation of treatment and women of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception. If a woman intends to become pregnant, Amvuttra and vitamin A supplementation 
should be discontinued and serum vitamin A levels should be monitored and have returned to normal 
before conception is attempted (see section 4.4.). Serum vitamin A levels may remain reduced for 
more than 12 months after the last dose of treatment.  
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of Amvuttra in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential teratogenic risk arising from 
unbalanced vitamin A levels, Amvuttra should not be used during pregnancy. As a precautionary 
measure, vitamin A (see section 4.4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels should be obtained early 
in pregnancy. Close monitoring of the foetus should be carried out, especially during the first 
trimester. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether vutrisiran is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the 
excretion of vutrisiran in animal milk (see section 5.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
Amvuttra, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for 
the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of Amvuttra on human fertility. No impact on male or female fertility 
was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Amvuttra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

drug antibodies (ADA). ADA titres were low and transient with no evidence of an effect on clinical 
efficacy, safety, or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles of vutrisiran. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored as medically indicated for any 
signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Nervous System Drugs; ATC code: N07XX18 
Mechanism of action 
Amvuttra contains vutrisiran, a chemically stabilized double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic 
acid (siRNA) that specifically targets variant and wild-type transthyretin (TTR) messenger RNA 
(mRNA) and is covalently linked to a ligand containing three N - acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
residues to enable delivery of the siRNA to hepatocytes.  
Through a natural process called RNA interference (RNAi), vutrisiran causes the catalytic degradation 
of TTR mRNA in the liver, resulting in the reduction of variant and wild-type serum TTR protein 
levels. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Mean serum TTR was reduced as early as Day 22, with mean near to steady state TTR reduction of 
73% by Week 6. With repeat dosing of 25 mg once every 3 months, mean reductions of serum TTR 
after 9 and 18 months of treatment were 83% and 88%, respectively. Similar TTR reductions were 
observed regardless of genotype (V30M or non-V30M), prior TTR stabiliser use, weight, sex, age, or 
race. 
Serum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein 4, which is the principal carrier of vitamin A in the 
blood. Amvuttra decreased vitamin A levels with mean steady state peak and trough reductions of 
70% and 63%, respectively (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Amvuttra was studied in a global, randomised, open-label clinical study (HELIOS-A) 
in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Patients were randomised 3:1 to 
receive 25 mg of Amvuttra (N=122) subcutaneously once every 3 months, or 0.3 mg/kg patisiran 
(N=42) intravenously once every 3 weeks. The treatment period of the study was conducted over 18 
months with two analyses at Month 9 and at Month 18. Ninety-seven percent (97%) of Amvuttra-
treated patients completed at least 18 months of the assigned treatments (vutrisiran or patisiran). 
Efficacy assessments were based on a comparison of the vutrisiran arm of the study with an external 
placebo group (placebo arm of the APOLLO Phase 3 study) comprised of a similar population of 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Assessment of non-inferiority of serum TTR 
reduction was based on comparison of the vutrisiran arm to the within-study patisiran arm. 
Of the patients who received Amvuttra, the median patient age at baseline was 60 years (range 34 to 
80 years), 38% were ≥ 65 years old, and 65% of patients were male. Twenty-two (22) different TTR 
variants were represented: V30M (44%), T60A (13%), E89Q (8%), A97S (6%), S50R (4%), V122I 
(3%), L58H (3%), and Other (18%). Twenty percent (20%) of patients had the V30M genotype and 
early onset of symptoms (< 50 years old). At baseline, 69% of patients had stage 1 disease 
(unimpaired ambulation; mild sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy in the lower limbs), and 31% 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had stage 2 disease (assistance with ambulation required; moderate impairment of the lower limbs, 
upper limbs, and trunk). There were no patients with stage 3 disease. Sixty-one percent (61%) of 
patients had prior treatment with TTR tetramer stabilisers. According to the New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) classification of heart failure, 9% of patients had class I and 35% had class II. 
Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients met pre-defined criteria for cardiac involvement (baseline LV 
wall thickness ≥ 13 mm with no history of hypertension or aortic valve disease).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Month 18 in modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7). This endpoint is a composite measure of motor, sensory, and 
autonomic neuropathy including assessments of motor strength, reflexes, quantitative sensory testing, 
nerve conduction studies, and postural blood pressure, with the score ranging from 0 to 304 points, 
where an increasing score indicates worsening impairment. 
The change from baseline to Month 18 in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QoL-DN) 
total score was assessed as a secondary endpoint. The Norfolk QoL-DN questionnaire (patient-
reported) includes domains relating to small fibre, large fibre, and autonomic nerve function, 
symptoms of polyneuropathy, and activities of daily living, with the total score ranging from -4 to 136, 
where increasing score indicates worsening quality of life. 
Other secondary endpoints included gait speed (10-meter walk test), nutritional status (mBMI), and 
patient-reported ability to perform activities of daily living and social participation (Rasch-Built 
Overall Disability Scale [R-ODS]). 
Treatment with Amvuttra in the HELIOS-A study demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
in all endpoints (Table 2 and Figure 1) measured from baseline to Month 9 and 18, compared to the 
external placebo group of the APOLLO study (all p < 0.0001). 
The time-averaged trough TTR percent reduction through Month 18 was 84.7% for vutrisiran and 
80.6% for patisiran. The percent reduction in serum TTR levels in the vutrisiran arm was non-inferior 
(according to predefined criteria) to the within-study patisiran arm through Month 18 with a median 
difference of 5.3% (95% CI 1.2%, 9.3%).

All Month 9 endpoints analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with multiple imputation (MI) method and all 
Month 18 analyzed using the mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
a External placebo group from APOLLO randomised controlled study 
Patients receiving Amvuttra experienced similar benefit relative to placebo in mNIS+7 and Norfolk 
QoL-DN total score at Month 9 and Month 18 across all subgroups including age, sex, race, region, 
NIS score, V30M genotype status, prior TTR stabiliser use, disease stage, and patients with or without 
pre-defined criteria for cardiac involvement.  
The N-terminal prohormone-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a prognostic biomarker of 
cardiac dysfunction. NT-proBNP baseline values (geometric mean) were 273 ng/L and 531 ng/L in 
Amvuttra-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. At Month 18, the geometric mean NT-
proBNP levels decreased by 6% in Amvuttra patients, while there was a 96% increase in placebo 
patients.  
Centrally-assessed echocardiograms showed changes in LV wall thickness (LS mean difference: -0.18 
mm [95% CI -0.74, 0.38]) and longitudinal strain (LS mean difference: -0.4% [95% CI -1.2, 0.4]) with 
Amvuttra treatment relative to placebo.  
Despite the observed values for NT-proBNP and LV wall thickness, a clinical benefit in regard to 
cardiomyopathy is yet to be confirmed.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
vutrisiran in all subsets of the paediatric population in hATTR amyloidosis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of Amvuttra were characterised by measuring the plasma and urine 
concentrations of vutrisiran. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration, vutrisiran is rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum plasma 
concentration (tmax) of 3.0 (range: 2.0 to 6.5) hours. At the recommended dosing regimen of 25 mg 
once every 3 months subcutaneously, the mean (% coefficient of variation [%CV]) steady state peak 
concentrations (Cmax), and area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) were 
0.12 μg/mL (64.3%), and 0.80 μg·h/mL (35.0%), respectively. There was no accumulation of 
vutrisiran in plasma after repeated quarterly dosing. 
Distribution 
Vutrisiran is greater than 80% bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range observed in 
humans at the dose of 25 mg once every 3 months subcutaneously. Vutrisiran plasma protein binding 
was concentration-dependent and decreased with increasing vutrisiran concentrations (from 78% at 
0.5 µg/mL to 19% at 50 µg/mL). The population estimate for the apparent central compartment 
volume of distribution (Vd/F) of vutrisiran in humans was 10.2 L (% Relative standard error 
[RSE]=5.71%). Vutrisiran distributes primarily to the liver after subcutaneous dosing. 
Biotransformation 
Vutrisiran is metabolised by endo- and exo-nucleases to short nucleotide fragments of varying sizes 
within the liver. There were no major circulating metabolites in humans. In vitro studies indicate that 
vutrisiran does not undergo metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. 
Elimination 
Following a 25 mg single subcutaneous dose, the median apparent plasma clearance was 21.4 (range: 
19.8, 30.0) L/h. The median terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of vutrisiran was 5.23 (range: 2.24, 
6.36) hours. After a single subcutaneous dose of 5 to 300 mg, the mean fraction of unchanged active 
substance eliminated in urine ranged from 15.4 to 25.4% and the mean renal clearance ranged from 
4.45 to 5.74 L/h for vutrisiran. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Following single subcutaneous doses over the 5 to 300 mg dose range, vutrisiran Cmax was shown to be 
dose proportional while area under the concentration-time curve from the time of dosing extrapolated 
to infinity (AUCinf) and area under the concentration-time curve from the time of dosing to the last 
measurable concentration (AUClast) were slightly more than dose proportional. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses in healthy subjects and patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis (n=202) showed a dose-dependent relationship between predicted vutrisiran liver 
concentrations and reductions in serum TTR. The model-predicted median steady state peak, trough, 
and average TTR reductions were 88%, 86%, and 87%, respectively, confirming minimal peak-to-
trough variability across the 3-month dosing interval. Covariate analysis indicated similar TTR 
reduction in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment, as well as 
by sex, race, prior use of TTR stabilisers, genotype (V30M or non-V30M), age and weight. 
Special populations 
Gender and race 
Clinical studies did not identify significant differences in steady state pharmacokinetic parameters or 
TTR reduction according to gender or race. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly patients 
In the HELIOS-A study, 46 (38%) patients treated with vutrisiran were ≥ 65 years old and of these 
7 (5.7%) patients were ≥ 75 years old. There were no significant differences in steady state 
pharmacokinetic parameters or TTR reduction between patients < 65 years old and ≥ 65 years old. 
Hepatic impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses indicated no impact of mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and AST > 1 x ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and 
any AST) on vutrisiran exposure or TTR reduction compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
Vutrisiran has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses indicated no impact of mild or moderate 
renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) on vutrisiran exposure or TTR reduction 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. Vutrisiran has not been studied in patients with 
severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
General toxicology 
Repeated once-monthly subcutaneous administration of vutrisiran at ≥ 30 mg/kg in monkeys produced 
the expected sustained reductions of circulating TTR (up to 99%) and vitamin A (up to 89%) without 
any apparent toxicological findings. 
Following once monthly repeated dosing for up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in monkeys, the mild 
and consistent non-adverse histological changes in liver (hepatocytes, Kupffer cells), kidneys (renal 
tubules), lymph nodes and injection sites (macrophages) reflected the principal distribution and 
accumulation of vutrisiran. However, no toxicities were identified at up to more than 1 000- and 
3 000-fold higher plasma AUC, when normalised to quarterly dosing and compared to the anticipated 
exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]. 
 Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity 
Vutrisiran did not exert any genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. Carcinogenicity studies have not 
been completed. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Vutrisiran is not pharmacologically active in rats and rabbits, which limits the predictivity of these 
investigations. Nevertheless, a single dose of a rat-specific orthologue of vutrisiran did not impact on 
fertility and early embryonic development in a combined study in rats. 
Weekly subcutaneous administrations of vutrisiran did not affect fertility and early embryonic 
development at more than 300-times the normalised MRHD In an embryo-foetal study with daily 
subcutaneous vutrisiran administration in pregnant rats, adverse effects on maternal body weight, food 
consumption, increased premature delivery and post-implantation loss were observed with a maternal 
NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day that was more than 300-times the normalised MRHD of 0.005 mg/kg/day. 
Based on an adverse reduction in foetal body weights and increased skeletal variations at 
≥10 mg/kg/day, the foetal NOAEL of vutrisiran was 3 mg/kg/day which is 97-times the normalised 
MRHD. 
In an embryo-foetal development study in pregnant rabbits, no adverse effects on embryo-foetal 
development were observed at ≤ 30 mg/kg/day vutrisiran, which is more than 1900-times the 
normalised MRHD. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a prenatal-postnatal development study, subcutaneous vutrisiran administration on every 6th day had 
no effect on growth and development of the offspring with a NOAEL of 20 mg/kg, which was more 
than 90-times the normalised MRHD.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Amvuttra is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Amvuttra is vutrisiran. 
What Amvuttra is used for 
Amvuttra is used for the treatment of an illness called ‘hereditary ATTR’ or ‘hATTR amyloidosis’. 
This is an illness which runs in families. hATTR amyloidosis is caused by problems with a protein in 
the body called ‘transthyretin’ (TTR). This protein is made mostly in the liver and carries vitamin A 
and other substances around the body. 
In people with this illness, small fibres of TTR protein clump together to make deposits called 
‘amyloid’. Amyloid can build up around or within the nerves, heart, and other places in the body, 
stopping them from working normally. This causes the symptoms of the illness. 
How Amvuttra works 
Amvuttra works by lowering the amount of TTR protein made by the liver which means there is less 
TTR protein in the blood that can form amyloid. This can help to reduce the effects of this illness. 
Amvuttra is used in adults only. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Amvuttra 
You must not be given Amvuttra 
• 
If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to vutrisiran, or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Lowered vitamin A levels in the blood and vitamin supplements 
Amvuttra lowers the amount of vitamin A in your blood. 
Your doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin A supplement. Please follow the vitamin A dose 
recommended by your doctor. 
Signs of low vitamin A may include: sight problems especially at night, dry eyes, hazy, or cloudy 
vision. 
• 
If you notice a change in your vision or any other eye problems whilst using Amvuttra, talk to 
your doctor. Your doctor may send you to an eye specialist for a check-up. 
Both too high and too low levels of vitamin A can harm the development of your unborn child. 
Therefore, women of childbearing age should exclude any pregnancy before starting treatment with 
Amvuttra and practise effective contraception (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
contraception” below). 
• 
• 
Vitamin A levels may remain low for more than 12 months after the last dose of Amvuttra.   
Tell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will tell you to stop taking 
Amvuttra and vitamin A supplementation. Your doctor will also ensure that your vitamin A 
levels have returned to normal before conception is attempted. 
Tell your doctor if you have an unplanned pregnancy. Your doctor will tell you to stop taking 
Amvuttra. In the first 3 months of your pregnancy, your doctor may tell you to stop taking 
vitamin A supplementation. During the last 6 months of your pregnancy, you doctor may tell 
you to resume the vitamin A supplementation if your vitamin A levels have not yet returned to 
normal, because of the increased risk of vitamin A deficiency during the last 3 months of your 
pregnancy. 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Amvuttra is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Amvuttra 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
You should not use Amvuttra if you are pregnant.  
Women of childbearing age 
Amvuttra will reduce the level of vitamin A in your blood and vitamin A is important for normal 
development of your unborn child (see “Warnings and precautions” above). 
• 
You should use effective contraception during treatment with Amvuttra - if you are a woman 
who is able to become pregnant. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception. 
Pregnancy should be excluded before starting treatment with Amvuttra. 
Tell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant or if you have an unplanned pregnancy. 
Your doctor will tell you to stop taking Amvuttra. 
• 
• 
• 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding  
It is not known if vutrisiran passes into breast milk. Your doctor will consider the potential benefits of 
treatment for you - compared with the risks of breast-feeding for your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Amvuttra is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. Your doctor will tell you whether 
your condition allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Amvuttra contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How Amvuttra is given 
This medicine will be given to you by a doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. 
How much Amvuttra you are given 
The recommended dose is 25 mg once every 3 months. 
Where the injection is given 
Amvuttra is given by injection under the skin (‘subcutaneous injection’) into your stomach area 
(abdomen), upper arm or thigh. 
How long to use Amvuttra 
Your doctor will tell you how long you need to receive Amvuttra. Do not stop treatment with 
Amvuttra unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you receive more Amvuttra than you should  
In the unlikely event that you are given too much (an overdose), your doctor will check you for side 
effects. 
If you miss your dose of Amvuttra 
If you miss an appointment for your Amvuttra injection, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as 
soon as you can to arrange to have the injection you missed. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

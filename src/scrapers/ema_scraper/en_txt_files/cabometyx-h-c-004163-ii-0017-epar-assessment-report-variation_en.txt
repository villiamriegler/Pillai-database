This application concerns an extension of indication to include the use of cabozantinib in combination with 
nivolumab for the first-line (1L) treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The proposed 
posology for this new indication is 40 mg cabozantinib administered once daily in combination with either 
240 mg nivolumab IV Q2W or 480 mg IV Q4W . This is a new posology for cabozantinib instead of the 
approved 60 mg daily (Cabometyx SmPC). The two dose regimens for nivolumab have already been 
approved for other indications (Opdivo SmPC). 
Disease or condition 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include the use of Opdivo in combination with 
cabozantinib the first-line (1L) treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
The proposed posology for this new indication is either 240 mg nivolumab intravenous (IV) every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) or 480 mg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) in combination with 40 mg cabozantinib administered orally 
once daily (QD) (see SmPC 4.2). 
Epidemiology 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth most 
common cancer in women, accounting for 3%-4% of all adult malignancies in the US (Siegel et al. CA A 
Cancer J Clin. 2019). The percentage of new cases across Europe in 2018 was 3.2%, with an estimated 
number of new cases over 136.000 and over 54.000 expected deaths (Globocan 2018). Well-known risk 
factors for RCC are cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension (Chow et al. Nat Rev Urol. 2010).

Biologic features 
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, comprising 80-90% of 
all kidney tumours (2020 European Association of Urology [EAU] RCC guidelines). 
Approximately 2%-3% of all RCCs are hereditary and several autosomal dominant syndromes are 
described, each with a distinct genetic basis and phenotype, the most common one being von Hippel–
Lindau (VHL) disease (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Many renal masses remain asymptomatic until the late disease stages. Currently, >50% of RCCs are 
detected accidentally by non-invasive imaging investigating various non-specific symptoms and other 
abdominal diseases (2020 EAU RCC guidelines; Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). In addition, 25-40% of 
the patients that are radically treated (nephrectomy) will eventually relapse. ‘Advanced’ RCC (hereafter 
simply referred to as advanced RCC) entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local 
therapy, i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus 
requires systemic treatment. All histological epithelial subtypes of RCC (clear cell, papillary, 
chromophobe) can present with sarcomatoid differentiation, which is the most aggressive form of RCC. A 
high proportion of RCC patients with sarcomatoid features presents with metastatic disease. These 
features are found in 5-8% of clear cell RCC.  
RCC with sarcomatoid features is characterised by limited therapeutic options due to its relative 
resistance to established systemic targeted therapy. Most trials report on a poor median OS of 5 to 12 
months. Studies have shown that sarcomatoid RCC express programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 
(PD-L1) at a much higher level than non-sarcomatoid RCC, suggesting that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 
axis may be an attractive new therapeutic strategy (Pichler et al. Cancers (Basel). 2019). 
Management 
Current systemic treatment of advanced RCC 
Recommendations mainly relate to clear cell histology, since most of the pivotal trials have been 
conducted in this common histological subtype (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
The clinical therapeutic scenario in advanced RCC changed radically in the last decade with the availability 
of targeted agents and, more recently, with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (Moscetti et al. 
ESMO Open. 2020). 
The choice of treatment is normally based on prognostic risk factors historically developed in the era of 
frontline vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
(UpToDate). The most commonly used prognostic model is the International Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) prognostic model (Heng et al. Lancet Oncol. 2013), that includes 
the following six adverse factors: 
-  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%; 
- 
time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year; 
-  haemoglobin concentration less than the lower limit of normal; 
- 
serum calcium greater than the upper limit of normal; 
-  neutrophil count greater than the upper limit of normal; and 
- 
platelet count greater than the upper limit of normal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 10/131 
 
 
 
 
Patients with none (0) of these risk factors are considered good risk, those with one or two (1-2) are 
considered intermediate risk, and those with three or more (≥3) are considered poor risk. The estimated 
median overall survival (OS) for the patients in these risk groups is 43.2 months, 22.5 months, and 7.8 
months, respectively. 
The most appropriate time to start systemic therapy is not well defined. Because of the indolent course of 
some RCCs, a period of observation before starting treatment should be considered, especially in patients 
with limited tumour burden and few symptoms (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
First-line systemic treatment 
The algorithm for first-line (1L) systemic treatment in ccRCC that is currently recommended by ESMO is 
presented in Figure 1 (eUpdate - ESMO RCC algorithm). Of note, all recommended medicinal products 
and combinations of medicinal products in this figure are approved by EMA, i.e. pembrolizumab + axitinib 
(Keytruda + Inlyta 1L RCC European public assessment report [EPAR]), sunitinib (Sutent 1L RCC EPAR), 
pazopanib (Votrient 1L RCC EPAR), tivozanib (Fotivda 1L RCC EPAR), nivolumab + ipilimumab (Opdivo + 
Yervoy 1L RCC EPAR), and cabozantinib (Cabometyx 1L RCC EPAR).

Abbreviation: ccRCC= clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
In addition, the combination of avelumab + axitinib has been approved by EMA for the 1L treatment of 
adult patients with advanced RCC (Bavencio + Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR). 
Plus, the combination of atezolizumab + bevacizumab has been tested against sunitinib in a phase 3 
study in the 1L RCC setting (Rini et al. Lancet. 2019). 
Previously EMA-approved medicinal products that are no longer recommended by ESMO for the treatment 
of RCC are not discussed here.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Cabozantinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 11/131 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) known to play important roles in 
tumour cell proliferation and/or tumour neovascularization including the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), MET, 
AXL, and RET. Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein in clear cell RCC 
(ccRCC) results in upregulation of VEGF, MET, and AXL. Increased expression of MET and AXL has been 
associated with poor prognosis in RCC. In addition, targets of cabozantinib, including TYRO3, MER, and 
AXL (TAM family kinases), are implicated in promoting suppression of an antitumor immune response.  
Cabozantinib is currently approved as Cabometyx in the EU as monotherapy in RCC and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). In RCC, cabozantinib is approved both in the first line (intermediate and poor risk) 
population, and in the 2nd line (following prior VEGF-targeted therapy) across all risk groups. 
Cabozantinib is also approved under the name Cometriq for the treatment of adult patients with 
progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. 
Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with 
its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Tumors use PD-L1 expression as defense or escape mechanism against the 
host’s anti-tumor T cell response; inhibiting PD-L1 restores the function of these anti-tumor T cells which 
have become ineffective or suppressed. Therefore, the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibition relies on a preexisting 
immune response.  
Nivolumab is currently approved as OPDIVO in the EU. Initial and subsequent approvals have resulted in 
indications for advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma, classical Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (cHL), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In RCC, nivolumab monotherapy is approved after 
previous therapy (2L+ setting). In combination with ipilimumab, nivolumab is approved in the 1st line 
intermediate and poor risk RCC population in the EU. 
Cabozantinib + nivolumab 
Multitargeted TKIs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent two systemic modalities that have 
contributed in the recent advancements in treatment of advanced RCC the past years. Nivolumab (2nd 
line) and cabozantinib (1st and 2nd line) have individually demonstrated clinical activity and significant 
improvement in OS in the treatment of patients with advanced RCC. Based on their different mechanism 
of action and potentially complementary effect, the MAH hypothesized that combining nivolumab and 
cabozantinib could produce additive clinical activity. The aim of the pivotal study CA2099ER was to 
evaluate the benefits and risks versus (previous) standard of care in the first-line RCC population, 
sunitinib. 
The combination of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and cabozantinib (anti-RTKs) has currently no approved 
indication in the EU. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Nivolumab plus cabozantinib combination therapy 
In an ongoing phase 1 study (CTEP-9681; Apolo et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020), the combinations nivo+cabo 
and nivolumab and ipilimumab with cabozantinib (nivo+ipi+cabo) are being evaluated in patients with 
previously treated advanced genitourinary cancers, including urothelial carcinoma (UC) and RCC. CTEP-
9681 was the first clinical study evaluating the nivo+cabo combination and its results informed the 
nivo+cabo dose selection for CA2099ER the pivotal study for the current application. The primary 
objectives of CTEP-9681 were to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 12/131 
 
 
 
 
dose (RP2D) of nivo+cabo and nivo+ipi+cabo in patients with genitourinary tumours. Patients were 
treated with a doublet regimen of nivo+cabo (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg Q2W nivolumab in combination with 
40 mg or 60 mg cabozantinib) which was found to be tolerable with no DLTs reported. However, a trend 
toward fewer treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and dose reductions for the lower 40 mg/day 
cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) compared to the 60 mg/day cabozantinib dose + 
nivolumab (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) was observed. The recommended phase 2 dose from CTEP-9681 was 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD and expansion with this dose resulted in anti-tumour 
responses in genitourinary cancers, including RCC. This combination dose regimen was thus selected for 
study CA2099ER. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH confirms that the clinical trials included in this submission were performed in accordance with 
the principles of Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) and were conducted to meet the ethical requirement of European Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Furthermore, it is stated that the clinical trials carried out outside the European Union also meet the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. For a free combination involving two marketed products and for which there is adequate clinical 
documentation on their co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be 
recommended unless there is significant toxicological concern. Thus, considering different targets for 
nivolumab (anti-PD1) and cabozantinib (RTK-inhibitor), and existing clinical safety data, combination 
toxicity data are not required. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applied Type II variation concerns an extension of indication to include the use of Cabometyx in 
combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in adults. 
In previous ERAs, a refined Fpen was applied based on the occurrence of advanced RCC and advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This led to a calculated PECsurfacewater of 0.0069 μg/L. As this value is 
below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was not triggered. 
The applied Type II variation does not lead to altered refined Fpen or PEC, since the extended indication 
falls under advanced RCC. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of cabozantinib. 
Cabozantinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The initial clinical pharmacology package for cabozantinib (Cabometyx) in the initial MAA 
(EMEA/H/C/4163) was based on the clinical pharmacology package for cabozantinib in medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC; Cometriq) (EMEA/H/C/2640), with three additional studies. The clinical PK of cabozantinib 
have previously been investigated in 11 clinical studies. Table 1. shows the key PK characteristics of 
cabozantinib established based on previous submissions.  
In this report the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib will be discussed with nivolumab as covariate while in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0092 the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab are discussed with 
cabozantinib as covariate.

Overview of new pharmacokinetics data 
No new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted in support the current application. 
PK data for cabozantinib were sparsely collected from patients in pivotal study CA2099ER in RCC patients 
receiving cabozantinib coadministered with nivolumab. These PK data were used to evaluate whether 
nivolumab may affect the PK of cabozantinib. Further, the PK data were added to an input data set of a 
previously developed population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model for cabozantinib. No exposure-response 
analyses were performed.

Plasma concentration analyses for cabozantinib were performed by a previously validated liquid 
chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method was validated for a range of 0.500 
to 1000 ng/mL based on the analysis of 50.0 µL of plasma by LC-MS-MS.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The PK data from study CA2099ER was analysed with popPK methodology. No non-compartmental 
analyses were conducted.

Evaluation and Qualification of models  
Previous models 
•  Model #1 (EMEA/H/C/2640). A popPK model was previously developed for cabozantinib using 
data from 289 patients with solid tumours (including MTC) following QD oral administration of 
140 mg cabozantinib capsules. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination, first-order 
absorption, and absorption lag time was used to describe the cabozantinib concentration-time 
profiles. Body mass index (BMI) and sex were identified as statistically significant predictors of 
cabozantinib CL/F, but they were not considered to be clinically relevant.  
•  Model #2 (EMEA/H/C/4163). A new popPK model was developed using data from 318 patients 
with RCC and 63 healthy volunteers. A two-compartment model with two parallel (fast and slow) 
lagged first-order absorption processes adequately described the pharmacokinetics of 
cabozantinib (Figure 1). The absorption rate constant for the faster absorption process was dose 
dependent. This feature was added to account for observed delay in the time to reach maximum 
concentration with increasing doses in Study XL184-020. The final covariate model included 
female gender (21% lower CL/F) and Asian race (27% lower CL/F than White subjects).  
•  Model #3 (EMEA/H/C/4163/II/5 and used in the current application). Model #2 was updated to 
include available PK data from 489 subjects with HCC, using the same structural model. Covariate 
effects evaluated in the development of Model #2 were reassessed in the updated dataset with a 
full model approach, thus including all potential covariates in the model regardless of statistical 
significance. The final model included capsule formulation on Ka and relative bioavailability, and 
age, sex, race, weight, cancer type and liver dysfunction on both CL/F and Vc/F. The MTC cancer 
type had the largest effect on cabozantinib PK parameters among the covariates examined (88% 
higher CL/F). The CL/F estimate was 24% lower in females. The most influential covariate effect 
on Vc/F included glioblastoma multiforme (~50% decrease in Vc/F). The parameter estimates for 
Model #3 are shown in Table 4. in this report.

Current application 
For the current application, the MAH has submitted a popPK modelling and simulation report. The 
objectives of this analysis were:  
1.  Assess the predictive performance of a population PK model developed for cabozantinib in healthy 
subjects and patients with various cancer types (Model #3) when applied to cabozantinib 
administered in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC from Study CA2099ER. The 
results are presented in the section Pharmacokinetics in target population.  
2.  Update the cabozantinib population PK model (Model #3) with pooled PK data from cabozantinib 
monotherapy studies and the combination therapy study with nivolumab, including appropriate 
covariates to account for differences between studies, if necessary. The results are presented in 
this section.  
3.  Generate individual predicted cabozantinib exposure measures for subsequent analyses (this was 
not performed).  
Software and estimation method 
PopPK predictions and updated modelling was performed using non-linear mixed effects modelling with 
NONMEM (v 7.3). Stochastic estimation methods including stochastic approximation expectation-
maximization (SAEM) and importance sampling (IMP) were used for parameter estimation and objective 
function value, respectively.  
Data 
The popPK analysis included plasma cabozantinib concentration-time data from CA2099ER and 
10 additional studies that supported the previous PopPK model . Plasma samples for cabozantinib 
concentration determination were collected in Study CA2099ER prior to the first dose in addition to a 
single sample at Weeks 5, 7, and 13 taken ~8 or more hours after prior evening dose.  
A prospectively written modelling analysis plan was included in the submission.   
The pooled analysis included 10,333 quantifiable PK samples obtained from 2331 subjects, including 
823 PK samples from 308 subjects in Study CA2099ER. A small percentage (<1%) of post-dose samples 
had concentrations that were BLQ, and these samples were excluded from the analysis in accordance with 
the pre-specified analysis plan. No PK samples were excluded from Study CA2099ER ( 
Table 2).  
The number of subjects, number of quantifiable PK samples and number of BLQ PK samples are listed by 
study in  
Table 2.

PK profiles of cabozantinib in Study CA2099ER are shown in Figure 2, with mean values stratified by the 
most recent dose prior to PK sample collection. All patients started at a dose regimen of 40 mg QD, 
except for 2 subjects who started at 20 mg QD, and 1 patient had a dose record of 60 mg. Doses were 
reduced from 40 mg QD to 20 mg QD for 134 of 320 (42%) subjects, and further from 20 mg QD to 
20 mg every other day for 31 of 320 (10%) subjects.

CA2099ER.  
Note: Grey lines represent observed cabozantinib concentration-time profiles for individual subjects, and mean 
concentrations at nominal timepoints are shown by green, red and blue symbols 
A total of 17 observations in the dataset were identified as potential outliers. To evaluate the influence of 
these outliers, the model was run with these data excluded and estimates of the key model parameters 
were compared to estimates from the base model with outliers included. Based on differences of <11% 
for all parameters, the outliers were not considered influential, in accordance with the pre-specified 
analysis plan.   
Covariates

Covariate information for the 2331 subjects (2191 cancer patients and 140 healthy subjects) included in 
the integrated analysis was summarised by study (data not shown). The majority of subjects were male 
(83.3%) and 16.6% of subjects were female. The median age was 64 years (range, 18 to 90 years) and 
median body weight was 78.4 kg (range, 30.4 to 190.7 kg). Cancer patients were generally older (20 to 
90 years) than healthy subjects (18 to 55 years). Distribution of subject race included 1809 (77.7%) 
White, 237 (10.1%) Asian, 54 (2.3%) Black and 72 (3%) other race, and 156 (6.7%) subjects had 
missing race information. Approximately 28% of the data were obtained with the capsule formulation and 
72% with the tablet formulation. All subjects in CA2099ER received tablet formulation.  
No subjects from CA2099ER had missing categorical covariates, and 307 of 308 (99.7%) had ALT, AST, 
bilirubin and creatinine clearance measurements available. As prespecified, continuous covariates were to 
be imputed as the median value from the study population. 
Results 
Updated popPK model 
Initially, the parameters of the previous model were re-estimated after inclusion of the CA2099ER 
population (not shown) and without any model modifications. Next, a covariate effect of nivolumab co-
administration was added to cabozantinib CL/F (Run 3, results not shown), and the estimated covariate 
coefficient (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 0.947 (0.871, 1.03), indicating a lack of statistical 
significance for the effect of nivolumab after the effect of RCC on cabozantinib CL/F was accounted for 
(RCC on CL/F estimate [95% CI]: 0.908 [0.811, 1.02]). The objective function increased by ~ 43 units 
with the addition of the nivolumab coadministration covariate. 
A preliminary visual predictive check (VPC) indicated overprediction of variability from day 40 (not 
shown). In order to improve the predictive performance, the model was refined by removing the effect of 
RCC on Vc/F for patients also receiving nivolumab, while retaining it for patients receiving cabozantinib 
monotherapy (Run 27). According to the MAH, this resulted in a slight improvement in the prediction of 
95th percentile cabozantinib concentrations in Study CA2099ER. Run 27 was therefore considered the 
updated final model although some degree of bias still remained in the predicted 95th percentile at the 
12 week timepoint according to the VPC (Figure 3). The change from Model 2 to Model 27 altered the 
estimated impact of nivolumab on CL/F to 0.99 (95% CI 0.93-1.06). The list of steps taken in the popPK 
model revision are shown in Table 3..

Goodness-of-fit plots for the updated integrated PK model for cabozantinib (not shown here) suggested 
good agreement between observed data and model predictions.  
Parameter estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table 4 for the previous 
model and the updated integrated model including RCC patients from Study CA2099ER. PK parameter 
estimates and covariate effects were similar to the previous integrated PK model; key parameter 
estimates (i.e., Ka, CL/F, and Vc/F) differed by ≤15%. For a White male subject, CL/F at steady state was 
estimated as 2.35 L/hr and Vc/F as 182 L. 
Compared to healthy subjects, RCC patients (Studies XL184-308 and CA2099ER) showed no significant 
effect on CL/F based on the confidence interval of the fractional change estimate including the value of 1. 
The model estimated a non-significant effect of RCC (Study XL184-308) on Vc/F. The magnitude of the 
nivolumab coadministration effect on cabozantinib CL/F was <1% and the confidence interval of the 
estimate included the value of 1, indicating a lack of statistical significance.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The target population in this application is patients receiving cabozantinib plus nivolumab as first line 
therapy for RCC. The PK of cabozantinib has previously been described in other populations (healthy 
volunteers, MTC, HCC, castration-resistant prostate cancer and glioblastoma multiforme), including 
subjects receiving cabozantinib monotherapy for RCC in second line following previous VEGFR-therapy. 
This section describes the comparison of cabozantinib PK with or without concomitant nivolumab therapy.

Exploratory analysis 
Dose-normalised cabozantinib concentrations at Week 5, 7 and 13 from the subset of subjects receiving 
the cohort-assigned 40 mg/day dose combined with nivolumab (in 14 out of 15 prior doses; the “Steady-
State Population”) was compared with dose-normalised cabozantinib concentrations at Week 5 in the 
previous METEOR trial where PK from single agent cabozantinib at 60 mg QD was evaluated in RCC (see 
dashed and dotted lines indicating cabozantinib concentrations from METEOR (Figure 4)).  
Figure 5. Dose-normalised cabozantinib concentrations at week 5, week 7, and week 13 after 
overnight dosing in the steady state-population (40 mg/day) in CA2099ER compared to 
cabozantinib single agent (60 mg/day) from METEOR trial (2L RCC).  
Model predictions 
The ability of the previous PopPK model (Model #3, described above) to describe cabozantinib 
concentration-time data for CA2099ER RCC patients was assessed via an external prediction-corrected 
VPC. From the 500 simulated datasets conditioned upon the observed study designs, 90% confidence 
intervals were calculated for the median, 5th and 95th percentiles of the predicted plasma cabozantinib 
concentration-time profiles and overlaid with the same percentiles of the observed cabozantinib 
concentration data. Results are presented in Figure 5. Overall, the observed concentrations were 
generally contained within the confidence intervals, supporting that cabozantinib PK data in RCC patients 
receiving combination therapy with nivolumab are similar to previous cabozantinib monotherapy data.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new PK/PD or exposure-response modelling for cabozantinib coadministered with nivolumab has been 
presented in this application. Results from the new dose finding study for the combination therapy (CTEP-
9681) are presented in section 2.4.1. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Cabozantinib (Cabometyx), as monotherapy, is currently approved for the treatment of HCC after 
previous sorafenib treatment, and advanced RCC in (1) treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor 
risk and (2) adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy. 
Characterisation of the clinical pharmacology of cabozantinib monotherapy has been provided in previous 
submissions. 
The clinical pharmacology data supporting this new combination therapy of cabozantinib together with 
nivolumab for the indication first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
consist of PK data from the pivotal CA2099ER study. In this study, plasma samples for cabozantinib 
concentration determination were sparsely collected (prior to the first dose, in addition to single samples 
at weeks 5, 7 and 13 at ~8 or more hours after prior evening dose). No clinical pharmacology data has 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 24/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been presented from the dose finding trial, CTEP-9681. This was acceptable since the trial design, 
including only two cabozantinib dose-levels, in addition to the sparse number of subjects, of which only 
one patient had RCC, limits the information that could have been gathered from such data (see section 
2.4.1 and 2.4.3).   
The raw plasma concentration data for cabozantinib in study CA2099ER were also compared with dose-
normalised raw plasma concentration data for XL184-308 (METEOR trial). At week 5, which is the only 
time-point with corresponding data from both trials, somewhat higher geometric mean exposure was 
observed in the CA2099ER trial (20.6 vs 18.2 ng/mL/mg). However, overall, the results do not indicate 
any relevant changes in cabozantinib PK when co-administered with nivolumab. Because nivolumab is a 
selective antibody, it is not expected to affect cabozantinib drug absorption or elimination pathways. The 
plasma concentration data for cabozantinib in the applied indication (1L RCC) in combination with 
nivolumab were compared with predictions using a previously developed popPK model based on 
cabozantinib monotherapy data. The observed concentrations of cabozantinib co-administered with 
nivolumab generally fell within the range of predicted concentrations from the cabozantinib monotherapy 
model. Together with the raw data comparison, this supports that nivolumab coadministration seemingly 
does not affect the PK of cabozantinib.  
In addition to the analyses described above, the impact of nivolumab on cabozantinib CL/F was evaluated 
by including nivolumab treatment as a covariate in the popPK model after re-estimating the parameters 
based on the combined data set. The popPK model used as starting point for this analysis has been 
previously developed using a full modelling approach and includes 30 covariate parameters of which 
several have 90% CIs comprising the null value and/or with biologically implausible estimated values 
(e.g. negative effect of body weight on clearance). A concern regarding whether this model may be 
overparameterised has been raised in previous assessments. When the model was now updated by 
including nivolumab co-administration as an additional covariate, the OFV increased by 43 points. Such 
increases in OFV between nested models indicate that the model with the covariate added has not 
converged into its global minimum. This adds to the previous concern that the model may be 
overparameterised. Generally, the main limitation with the full modelling approach is sensitivity to 
correlating covariates and this was not addressed by the MAH. Thus, the results from these modelling 
exercises should be interpreted with caution and not used to derive conclusions. However, the model is 
not necessary to answer essential questions in this application. Nevertheless, for future applications in 
which the modelling results may have higher relevance, the MAH is encouraged to consider simplifying 
the model. 
In the MAA for cabozantinib RCC monotherapy, relationships between increasing exposure and several 
adverse events have been demonstrated, while the optimal biologically active dose, i.e. the dose level 
where an increase in dose do not further improve clinical outcomes, is undetermined. Cabozantinib dose 
levels, safety and dose modifications are further discussed under section 2.4.1. Dose response study and 
2.5 Clinical safety. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The cabozantinib clinical pharmacology data are considered adequate for this application to extend the 
indication to include combination therapy with nivolumab. 
The PK of cabozantinib do not seem to be affected by co-administration of nivolumab.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The applied indication is based on results from CA2099ER, an open label, Phase 3, multicentre and 2-
armed randomised comparative trial of nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib (nivo + cabo) versus 
sunitinib as first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic RCC. 
Dose selection for nivolumab combined with cabozantinib is based on an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 
trial (CTEP-9681), NCT02496208, supported by the National Cancer Institute NCI/NIH. 
Selective data from the CABOSUN trial (Phase 2 study of cabozantinib monotherapy versus sunitinib in 
subjects with RCC, intermediate and poor IMDC risk groups) and the METEOR trial (Phase 3 comparative 
study of cabozantinib versus everolimus in 2L+ clear cell RCC, all IMDC risk groups) were included as 
supportive with the aim to justify the contribution of nivolumab to the efficacy of the cabozantinib + 
nivolumab regimen. In addition, the preliminary results from the ongoing CA209669 study (Phase 2 
single-arm study of nivolumab and salvage nivolumab + ipilimumab in treatment-naïve patients with 
advanced RCC, all IMDC risk groups) were provided to justify the contribution of cabozantinib in the 1L 
treatment of RCC. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Dose selection for nivolumab combined with cabozantinib was based on an investigator-sponsored Phase 
1 trial (CTEP-9681), NCT02496208, evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab (doublet) 
or cabozantinib with nivolumab and ipilimumab (triplet) in subjects with previously treated advanced 
genitourinary (GU) cancers, including 1 subject with RCC. The data presented below are published in 
Apolo et al J Clin Oncol 2020, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.20.01652.  
The primary objective of the trial was to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab and cabozantinib, nivolumab and 
ipilimumab. Data from subjects receiving triplet therapy are not presented.  
Secondary objectives included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of 
response (DoR) and overall survival (OS).  
Patients and methods 
Eligible patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic GU tumours with new or 
progressive lesions on cross-sectional imaging, measurable by RECIST v1.1. Patients must have received 
one or more lines of standard therapy unless no standard treatment existed that had been shown to 
prolong survival. 
The DLT period referred to the first 4 weeks during the dose-escalation phase for all dose levels. A DLT 
was defined as an adverse event (AE) potentially attributable to any of the study drugs or the 
combination that required permanent discontinuation of protocol therapy or was grade ≥ 3 according to 
the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. If dose 
reduction or interruption of cabozantinib led to a patient taking ≤ 75% of the planned dose within the DLT 
observation period, the event was considered a DLT. 
Part 1 had four escalating dose levels of continuous daily oral cabozantinib and intravenous (IV) 
nivolumab administrated every 2 weeks for a 28-day cycle (Table 5).  
Dose reductions for cabozantinib (40 mg/day, 20 mg/day, then 20 mg every other day) and interruptions 
of study treatment were specified for management of AEs. After dose reduction, no dose escalation was 
permitted. No dose modification was allowed for nivolumab.

Results  
For patients who received cabozantinib and nivolumab, the median duration of treatment was 
6.36 months (IQR, 2.66-19.51 months), and the time to best response was 1.81 months (IQR, 1.71-
3.68 months). 
The most common treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) observed in patients who received cabozantinib 40 mg 
vs. 60 mg daily and the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation, dose hold, and dose 
reduction are reported in Table 6 and Table 7.

In the dose escalation stage of the study, no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported during the 
defined observation period (28 days) for the doublet combination. However, a trend toward fewer 
treatment-related AEs and dose reductions for the lower 40 mg/day cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (33% 
cabozantinib dose reductions) compared with the 60 mg/day cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (75% 
cabozantinib dose reductions) were observed (Table 7). Based on the overall tolerability, RP2D for the 
doublet regimen was cabozantinib 40 mg QD administered orally with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W 
administered IV.

CA2099ER: A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label Study of Nivolumab 
Combined with Cabozantinib versus Sunitinib in Participants with Previously 
Untreated Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma 
Methods 
A final clinical study report (CSR) was completed based on database lock date of 30-Mar-2020. These 
data form the basis of this application, and include efficacy and safety data with a median follow up of 
18.1 months (minimum follow-up of 10.6 months). 
CA2099ER consisted of 3 phases: screening, treatment and follow-up (see Figure 6 below). Subjects were 
assessed for response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] v1.1) by computed 
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging beginning 12 weeks (± 7 days) from randomisation and

Treatments 
The study treatments are outlined in Table 8. 
Table 8. Treatments and timing of dose 
Participants began study treatment within 3 days (72 hours) of randomisation. For Arm A, participants 
received nivolumab at a dose of 240 mg as an approximately 30-minute infusion on Day 1 of each 2-
week treatment cycle. Cabozantinib was taken daily by mouth on an empty stomach, preferably at bed 
time. For Arm C, sunitinib was taken orally without regard to meals. The study used the label-
recommended dose and schedule for RCC (50 mg QD 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off). 
In both study arms treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1-defined progression was 
permitted if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug, as determined by the 
investigator. Nivolumab was administered for a maximum of two years. For cabozantinib and sunitinib 
dosing may continue beyond two years in absence of progression and unacceptable toxicity. 
Per protocol, no crossover was allowed. 
Dose delays and dose reductions 
Dose delays for management of AEs during nivolumab, cabozantinib, or sunitinib treatment were allowed. 
Dosing of nivolumab could be delayed without delay of cabozantinib dosing if toxicity was felt to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 32/131 
 
 
 
 
 
related to only nivolumab, and vice versa. For dose delay, criteria for nivolumab, sunitinib and 
cabozantinib were defined in the protocol. As a general approach, all AEs related to the study drugs were 
to be managed with supportive care when possible at the earliest signs of toxicity.  
No dose reductions were allowed for nivolumab. Dose reductions for AE management were allowed for 
cabozantinib and sunitinib. 
Two levels of dose reduction were permitted for cabozantinib: 20 mg daily, and then to 20 mg every 
other day. After toxicity requiring a dose delay had improved and met the criteria to resume dosing, 
cabozantinib dose could be resumed at a reduced dosing level. Participants who were receiving 
cabozantinib 20 mg daily prior to the delay and require another dose delay were to resume cabozantinib 
at 20 mg every other day. If more than 2 dose reductions were necessary (i.e., reduction to less than 
20 mg every other day), cabozantinib was to be permanently discontinued. For sunitinib, dose reductions 
occurred in 12.5 mg decrements (e.g. 37.5 mg, 25 mg). No more than 2 dose reductions were allowed. If 
more than 2 levels of dose reductions were necessary (i.e., reduction to less than 25 mg daily), the 
participant was to be permanently discontinued. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Study treatments continue until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator and confirmed 
by BICR, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) or intercurrent illness prevents further administration of 
treatment, death or withdrawal of consent. For Arm A, although there is overlap among the 
discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria were met for one study drug but not the other, it might 
be acceptable to continue treatment with the study drug that was not felt to be related to the toxicity as 
specified. If the investigator considered the toxicity to be related to both study drugs or was unable to 
determine which of the study drug was the cause of the toxicity, then both study drugs in the treatment 
regimen were to be discontinued, and the recommendations for management of toxicity related to both 
study drugs were to be promptly initiated.  
After discontinuation of study therapy participants were followed for at least 100 days after last dose of 
study treatment (Follow-up Visit 2). After the Follow-up Visit 2, all participants will be followed for overall 
survival status every 3 months (+/- 14 days) until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or end 
of study. Adverse events (AEs) were followed until the toxicities resolved, returned to baseline, or were 
deemed irreversible.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) – RECIST v1.1 by BICR in nivolumab combined with cabozantinib 
(Arm A) compared to sunitinib (Arm C) 
o  The primary definition of PFS was defined as the time from randomisation to the first 
documented disease progression per RECIST v.1.1 based on BICR or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurs first. Patients were censored in case of: 
 
 no baseline tumour assessment,  
  no on study tumour assessment and no death,  
 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy started 
  no progression and no death and no new anti-cancer therapy started. 
o  The secondary definition of PFS was defined as the time between the date of 
randomisation and the date of first documented tumour progression, based on BICR 
assessments (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first 
(without censoring for subsequent therapy). Patients were censored in case of: 
  no baseline tumour assessment,  
  no on study tumour assessment and no death,  
  no progression and no death. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Overall survival (OS) comparison between Arm A and Arm C 
o  OS is defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of death due to 
any cause. A participant who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date. 
•  Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by BICR comparison between arm A and Arm C 
o  ORR is defined as the proportion of randomised participants who achieve a best response 
of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
o  Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation recorded 
between the date of randomisation and the date of objectively documented progression 
per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy (including tumour-directed 
radiotherapy and tumour-directed surgery), whichever occurs first. 
Exploratory endpoints:

o  PFS-2 was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of investigator-defined 
documented second objective disease progression after second-line therapy or death due 
to any cause, whichever comes first. Clinical deterioration was not to be considered as 
progression. A subject who neither progresses nor dies was to be censored on the date of 
his/her last adequate tumor assessment or last follow-up for progression/subsequent 
therapy. A subject who does not have any post-baseline tumor assessments and who has 
not died was to be censored on the date at which he/she was randomised. 
•  Biomarkers: PD-L1 and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) expression in tumour specimens 
and in blood samples, and their potential relationship to efficacy and safety endpoints 
• 
Immunogenicity: incidence of anti-nivolumab-antibodies and their potential relationship with 
safety and safety endpoints 
•  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): assessed by the NCCN functional assessment of cancer 
therapy-kidney symptom index (FKSI-19) and the EuroQoL Group’s EQ-5D (3L version) 
Sample size 
Sample size calculations were based on primary endpoint PFS by BICR in Arm A and Arm C, and the 
secondary OS endpoint. The total number of randomised subjects were higher due to Arm B that was 
stopped when implementing CA2099ER Global Revised Protocol 01. Assuming a 25% screen failure rate, 
it was expected that approximately 850 subjects would need to be enrolled in order to randomize 638 
subjects (319 per arm) in a 1:1 ratio.  
The analysis of PFS in Arm A vs Arm B was to be conducted on all randomised subjects after 
approximately 9-10 months minimum follow-up, when approximately 350 events had occurred in Arm A 
and Arm C combined. With a two-sided Type I error of 0.05 this was calculated to provide 95% power to 
detect a HR of 0.68, corresponding to a 47% increase in median PFS assuming median PFS of 18.2 and 
12.4 months for Arm A and Arm C, respectively.  
If the formal analysis of PFS among all randomised subjects was statistically significant, OS in the same 
population was to be tested in a hierarchical testing procedure. It was calculated that approximately 
254 events (i.e., deaths) in Arm A and Arm C would provide at least 80% power to detect a HR of 0.70, 
assuming median OS of 47.1 and 33 months for Arm A and Arm C respectively, and an overall type 1 
error of 0.05 (two-sided). There were two formal interim analyses planned for OS, the first at time of final 
PFS analysis, expecting to observe 165 OS events (65% of final targeted OS events), and the second 
when approximately 211 events (83% of targeted final OS events). The stopping boundaries for these 
analyses were derived based on actual number of observed events at the time of analysis using O’Brien 
and Flemming α-spending function.

Randomisation 
Participants were randomised between Arm A (nivolumab + cabozantinib) and Arm C (sunitinib 
monotherapy) in a 1:1 ratio. Prior to randomisation subjects were stratified according to the following 
factors: 
1)  International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) prognostic score (0 
[favorable risk] vs 1-2 [intermediate risk] vs 3-6 [poor risk]).  
2)  Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour expression (≥ 1% vs < 1% or indeterminate).  
3)  Geographic region (US/Canada/Western Europe/Northern Europe vs rest of the world) 
The randomisation to IMDC favorable risk participants was capped at approximately 25% to represent the 
typical frequency of favorable risk subjects among mRCC. Tumour PD-L1 expression levels were 
determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing by the central lab (classified as PD-L1 expression 
≥1%, <1%, or indeterminate) prior to randomization 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Hypothesis 
The hypothesis for the study was that treatment with nivolumab combined with cabozantinib (doublet 
regimen) would demonstrate an improvement in PFS per BICR compared to sunitinib monotherapy in 
subjects with previously untreated mRCC.  
Interim analyses / Multiplicity 
An independent statistician external to BMS was to perform the interim analyses. For details of the 
planned hierarchical testing / interim analyses for OS, see sample size section. In addition to the formal 
planned interim analyses for OS, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) had access to periodic un-blinded 
interim reports of efficacy and safety to allow a risk/benefit assessment, as per the DMC charter.  
Analysis populations 
All analyses were to be carried out using the treatment arm as randomised (intent to treat), with the 
exception of dosing and safety, for which the treatment arm as received were to be used. Analysis 
populations, for Arm A and Arm C, were as defined in Table 10 below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 36/131 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 10. Analysis populations (Arm A and Arm C) 
Statistical method of analysis  
In general, time-to-event variables were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with medians 
reported, with 95% CI using Brookmeyer and Crowley method using log-log transformation for 
constructing the confidence intervals, and rates at fixed time points with their associated 95% CIs based 
on Greenwood formula for variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied survivor function. 
Confidence intervals for binomial proportions were derived using the Clopper-Pearson method. The 
unweighted difference in ORRs between the two treatment arms and corresponding asymptotic 95% CI 
were estimated using a Newcombe method.  
PFS per BICR was compared between the treatment groups via stratified log-rank test among all 
randomised subjects at a two-sided α = 0.05 level. The stratification factors were; IMDC prognostic risk 
score (0 vs 1-2 vs 3-6), region (US/Canada/W Europe/N Europe vs ROW)’ and PD-L1 status (≥ 1% vs < 
1% or indeterminate). The hazard ratio was calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
with treatment as the sole covariate. These analyses were performed for the primary and secondary 
definitions of PFS, i.e. adjusting for subsequent anticancer therapy or not. 
A multivariate Cox regression model was used in order to estimate the treatment effect after adjustment 
for possible imbalances in known or potential prognostic factors, including the same stratification factors 
as in the randomisation (IMDC score [0 vs 1-2 vs 3-6], Region [US/Canada/W.Europe/N.Europe vs. 
ROW], Baseline PD-L1+ status based on a 1% cut off) and including as covariates; Age categorisation 
(<65 vs. ≥ 65), Gender (Male vs. Female), Race, Karnofsky performance status (100-90, <90), Prior 
Nephrectomy (Yes, No), LDH level (≤ 1.5 x ULN , > 1.5 x ULN), Number of organ with metastasis (1 vs. 
≥2).  
Additional sensitivity analyses included: an un-stratified log rank test, a weighted log-rank test G(rho=0, 
gamma=1) to test for late separation KM-curves, PFS censoring for two missed assessments, PFS by 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021

investigator assessment (and analysis of concordance with BICR assessment), an un-stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model with stratification factors of randomisation as covariates, or with a treatment 
by time interaction term, and a test for qualitative interaction of treatment and strata. Since no delayed 
effect in in PFS KM-curves was noted, a planned sensitivity analysis using a stratified time-dependent Cox 
model with effects for treatment and period-by-treatment interaction, where period was defined as before 
after 6mth, was not carried out.  
Overall survival was compared between the treatment groups at the interim and final analyses, for all 
randomised subjects, using a log-rank test stratified by the same factors as for PFS. An O’Brien and 
Fleming α-spending function was employed to determine the nominal significance levels for the interim 
and final analyses, based on actual observed number of events at the time of analysis (see sample size 
section). The stratified hazard ratio between the treatment groups was presented along with 100*(1- α)% 
CI (adjusted for interim). These analyses were also applied to intermediate/poor-risk subjects in Arm A 
and Arm C.  
Subgroup analyses – time to event endpoints 
For the time to event endpoints, PFS and OS, medians based on KM estimates (with two-sided 95% CIs), 
and a forest plot of the unstratified hazard ratios (with two-sided 95% CIs) were to be presented for 
relevant subgroups.  
Objective Response Rate  
The number and percentage of subjects in each category of BOR per BICR (complete response [CR], 
partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], or unable to determine [UTD]) was 
presented, by treatment group, for all randomised subjects. Estimates of response rate, along with its 
exact two-sided 95% CI by Clopper and Pearson were presented, by treatment group. In addition, a 
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test of superiority, was carried out. These analyses were also 
performed for Intermediate/poor-risk subjects only. A forest plot presenting un-weighted differences in 
ORR between treatment groups, with 95% CI by Newcombe method, was presented for the same subsets 
as for PFS and OS subsets (where N > 10).  
Time to Tumour Response, Duration of Response (DoR) and PFS-2 
The DoR for each treatment group was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit method, 
displayed graphically, and results tabulated presenting number of events, number of subjects involved, 
medians, and 95% CIs for the medians in each treatment group based on a log-log transformation 
method. DoR was censored for ongoing follow-up, off-study (lost to follow-up, withdraw consent, never 
treated) or Received subsequent anticancer therapy. TTR, which does not involve censoring, was 
summarised by treatment group in all responders using descriptive statistics. PFS-2 was analysed 
similarly to PFS.  
Clinical Outcomes Assessments  
FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-3L was summarised descriptively by treatment groups for randomised subjects in 
Arm A and C who had an assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. 
Questionnaire completion rate, mean score and mean change from baseline at each assessment time 
point was summarised using descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, 
minimum, maximum), for total scores and subscales, and mean change from baseline plotted ( including 
95% CI).

Results 
Participant flow 
The participant flow in study CA2099ER is shown in Figure 7. 
Of the 640 treated patients, 270 patients (42.2%) were ongoing in the treatment period at the time of 
30-Mar-2020 DBL: 178 (55.6%) with nivo+cabo and 92 (28.8%) with sunitinib. The percentage of 
patients who discontinued the treatment period were 44.4% and 71.3% in the nivo+cabo and sunitinib 
arms, respectively. The primary reason for not completing the treatment period was disease progression 
(243 patients, 38.0%): 89 (27.8%) with nivo+cabo and 154 (48.1%) with sunitinib. Of these, 15 (4.7%) 
and 31 (9.7%) patients in the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, respectively, discontinued treatment due to 
study drug toxicity. 
Overall, 188 patients (29.4%) discontinued the study, and the most common reason for not continuing 
the study was death (146 patients [22.8%]: 62 patients [19.4%] with nivo+cabo and 84 patients 
[26.3%] with sunitinib). Study treatment was ongoing in 55.6% (N=178/320) of the subjects treated 
with cabo + nivo and in 28.8% (N=92/320) treated with sunitinib.  
Note: 50 patients were randomized to Arm B, but enrolment to this arm was stopped after the 
implementation of CA2099ER Revised Protocol Version 1, see below at Conduct of the study -

Protocol version 01 (18-Dec-2017): 
1. stop enrolment into Arm B (nivolumab, ipilimumab and cabozantinib triplet) 
2. include favourable risk participants (capped at 25%) in the study 
3. add a Data Monitoring Committee review after 30 participants were treated for 6 weeks 
Protocol version 02 (03-May-2019): 
1. adjust the timing of the PFS and OS interim analyses with modified hypothesized OS hazard ratio (HR). 
The number of randomised participants increased from 290 to 319 per arm. 
2. The interim analysis for ORR was removed, resulting in revised overall alpha for PFS and OS endpoints. 
3. No change in eligibility or study procedure 
4. Clinical data for nivolumab + ipilimumab in RCC have been updated 
Protocol deviations 
Significant protocol deviations were defined as related to inclusion and exclusion criteria, study conduct, 
and study management that differed significantly from the protocol, including GCP non-compliance. The 
total number of subjects with significant protocol deviations was 149/323 (46.2%) in Arm A and 126/328 
(38.5%) in Arm C. 
Deviations were reported across the following categories: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Failure to obtain written consent prior to each subject’s participation in the study (n=31 Arm A, 
n=30 Arm C) 
Failure to report all SAEs in accordance with the time period required by GCP, the protocol and 
applicable regulations (n=17 Arm A, n=20 Arm C) 
Implementation of protocol changes prior to review by IRB/IEC or failure to implement an 
IRB/IEC approved amendment (n=6 Arm A, n=5 Arm C) 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria (n=58 Arm A, n=50 Arm C) 
Incorrect dosing or study treatment assignment (n=14 Arm A, n=8 Arm C) 
Tumour assessment not per protocol (n=7 Arm A, n=4 Arm C) 
Lack of required lab tests prior to dosing (n=5 Arm A, n=2 Arm c) 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 40/131 
 
 
 
 
•  Discontinuation criteria (n=1 Arm A, n=1 Arm C) 
The most common deviations in both arms were associated with inclusion/exclusion criteria (58 in Arm A 
vs. 50 in Arm C). The majority of cases in this category was due to “baseline labs collected not within 14 
days of randomisation” (n=23 in Arm A vs. n=15 in Arm C) and “baseline tumour assessments not 
performed within 28 days prior to randomisation” (n=12 in Arm A vs. n=14 in Arm C).  
Totally 61 protocol deviations (n=31 in Arm A vs. n=30 in Arm C) in the “failure to obtain written consent 
prior to each subject’s participation in the study” category were registered. All randomised subjects 
signed an initial consent. However, 2 subjects had screening activities performed prior to signing the 
consent and 3 subjects had “incorrect written consent process”. The remaining deviations were related to 
delays in re-consenting of updated written consent. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of all randomised subjects are presented in the table 
below.

Three (3) subjects (0.9%) in the nivo + cabo arm and 2 subjects (0.6%) in the sunitinib arm received 
one prior systemic anticancer treatment, all of which were in the adjuvant setting. One subject in the nivo

+ cabo arm received prior treatment with pazopanib, and this was considered a relevant protocol 
deviation (see Section “Protocol deviations” above). 
Concomitant medication 
Most subjects (98.1%) received concomitant medication(s) during the treatment period. The frequency of 
immune modulating concomitant medications was all over high: 50.6% (324 subjects) of the ITT 
population; 60.6% (194 subjects) in the nivo + cabo arm and 40.6% (130 subjects) in the sunitinib arm. 
Included in these immune modulating medications are corticosteroids for systemic use: 55.9% and 
33.4%, respectively in the two treatment arms. 
Reasons for using systemic corticosteroids in the ITT population were categorised and listed as 
premedication, for adverse events (AE) or other use. The most frequent reason for concomitant use of 
systemic corticosteroids was treatment of AE (52.5% and 29.1%, in Arm A and C, respectively). No 
subject used systemic corticosteroids as premedication. The most frequently reported AEs of any grade 
that required immune modulating concomitant medication were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome in both arms, followed by rash and diarrhoea in Arm A (nivo + cabo) and mucosal inflammation 
and stomatitis in Arm C (sunitinib).  
High dose corticosteroids were administered to subjects in CA2099ER in approximately 20% of nivo+cabo 
treated subjects with immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) or Selected AEs; approximately 10% 
received high dose corticosteroids for a duration of at least 2 weeks and approximately 4% received high 
dose for a duration of at least 30 days. 
Subsequent anticancer therapy 
Subsequent cancer therapy (radiotherapy, surgery, and/or systemic therapy) was received by 61 subjects 
(18.9%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared to 108 subjects (32.9%) in the sunitinib arm. Subsequent 
systemic therapy was received by 36 subjects (11.1%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 91 subjects (27.7%) in 
the sunitinib arm. Subsequent anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy was received by 2.8% of subjects in the 
nivo+cabo arm compared with 20.4% for the sunitinib arm. A similar percentage of subjects in the 
nivo+cabo arm and sunitinib arm received subsequent antiangiogenic drugs (9.6% vs 10.7%). 
Numbers analysed 
Populations for analyses refer to participants in Arm A and Arm C, with exception of “enrolled” which also 
included subjects screened and randomised to Arm B. The efficacy analyses were based on the ITT 
population, which included participants in the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, 
regardless of whether or not they received study treatment. The patient populations analysed is provided 
in the Table below.

Outcomes and estimation 
In study CA2099ER, the last participant was randomised on 14-may-2019 and clinical cut-off occurred on 
12-Feb-2020 (Last patient last visit, LPLV). The median duration of follow-up (date of randomisation to 
the last known date alive or death date) was approximately 15.7 months for the nivo + cabo arm and 
14.59 months for the sunitinib arm. By database lock (DBL) on 30-Mar-2020, the minimum and median 
follow-up for OS was approximately 10.6 and 18.1 months, respectively.  
Efficacy 
The overall efficacy results include the primary and secondary endpoints in all randomised subjects (ITT 
population), and are summarised in the table below.

The primary endpoint of PFS per BICR and both secondary endpoints (OS and ORR per BICR) were 
statistically significant for Arm A (nivo + cabo) vs Arm C (sunitinib). The OS data are still immature as 
the medians were not reached in either arm, and the rate of events was 20.7% in the study arm and 
30.2% in the control arm.   
The summary of efficacy in the table above refers to the primary definition of PFS, which does not 
account for tumour progression post sequent therapies. Analysis of PFS per BICR using the secondary 
definition is presented below. The Kaplan Meier Plot of PFS below represents the secondary definition 
of PFS (Figure 8).  
Primary endpoint 
Progression free survival (PFS) 
PFS per BICR and censoring for subsequent therapy (primary definition) compared with sunitinib: 
In all randomised subjects, nivo+cabo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per 
BICR  
•  HR = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.64); stratified log-rank test p-value <0.0001.  
•  Median PFS was longer with nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib: 16.59 (95% CI: 12.45, 24.94) 
vs 8.31 (95% CI: 6.97, 9.69) months, respectively. 
• 
PFS rates were higher with nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib: 68.3% vs 47.8% at 9 months, 
respectively.

These analyses were consistent with the analysis for the primary PFS definition. 
•  HR = 0.54 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.67), p <0.0001).  
•  Median PFS was longer with nivo+cabo compared to sunitinib: 14.29 (95% CI: 12.29, 19.84) vs 
8.31 (95% CI: 7.00, 9.69) months, respectively.  
At 30-Mar-2020 DBL, 55.4% and 41.8% of randomised subjects in the nivo + cabo and sunitinib arms, 
respectively, were censored for PFS, with “still on treatment” to be the most common reason for 
censoring.

Concordance between BICR and investigator PFS assessments was high: 83.9% and 82.9% for nivo+cabo 
and sunitinib arms, respectively.  
•  Median investigator-assessed PFS by primary definition was 19.38 months (16.59, N.A.) and 
9.20 months (7.06, 11.04) for nivo+cabo and sunitinib respectively, HR = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.36, 
0.57) for nivo+cabo vs sunitinib, p < 0.0001. 
Results for the sensitivity analysis of PFS (analysis using stratification factors as determined at baseline 
[CRF source]): HR= 0.47 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.59), p < 0.0001; for PFS secondary definition HR=0.51 (95% 
CI: 0.41, 0.63), p < 0.0001. 
In a multivariate analysis, the treatment effect of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib when adjusted for the baseline 
factors of age (< 65, ≥ 65), gender (male, female), race, region, IMDC score 0, 1-2, 3-6), Karnofsky

Results for a sensitivity analysis of PFS using stratification factors as determined at baseline (CRF source) 
and a multivariate analysis (adjusting for several baseline factors) were consistent with the primary PFS 
analysis (both in regards to the primary and the secondary definition of PFS). 
Overall, 301 progression events have been observed by DBL 30 March 2020. 
For the assessment of PFS defined according to the primary definition, patients were censored due to 
receiving subsequent anticancer therapy:  7.1% of the patients were censored on date of last tumor 
assessment on-study due to start of new anti-cancer therapy in the cabo + nivo arm vs. 13.1% in the 
sunitinib arm (data not shown).  
Updated PFS data according to DBL SEP-2020 are presented under Ancillary analyses.  
Secondary endpoints 
Overall Survival 
As the formal analysis of PFS was statistically significant, the formal (first planned) IA of OS was tested, 
as per hierarchical testing procedure. As this IA of OS crossed the pre-specified boundary for statistical 
significance (nominal significance level p < 0.0111), it is considered the final analysis and no additional 
analysis will be performed. 
At 30-Mar-2020 database lock, the event rates for OS were 20.7% and 30.2% of randomised subjects in 
the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, respectively. A total of 79.3% and 69.8%, respectively, were censored 
for OS (Table 15). 
• 
The HR showed a statistically significant improvement in OS for nivo+cabo compared with 
sunitinib; HR = 0.60 (98.89% CI: 0.40, 0.89), p = 0.0010. 
•  Median OS was not reached in either treatment groups (Table 13).  
•  OS rates were slightly higher in the nivo+cabo arm compared with the sunitinib arm: 89.9% vs 
80.5% at 9 months. 
•  Results for the sensitivity analyses, i.e., tests for qualitative interaction, tests for assumptions 
gave a p-value of 0.9181 and 0.2615, respectively. 
• 
In a multivariate analysis, the treatment effect of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib when adjusted for the 
baseline factors of age (< 65, ≥ 65), gender (male, female), race, region, IMDC score (0, 1-2, 3-
6), Karnofsky performance status (100-90, < 90), prior nephrectomy, LDH level (≤1.5*ULN vs > 
1.5*ULN), PD-L1 status (< 1%, ≥ 1%), and number of organ with metastasis (1, ≥ 2), was: HR 
0.60 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.82), p = 0.0015.

Time to response and duration of response 
Median TTR per BICR was 2.83 months (min,max: 1.0, 19.4) for all confirmed responders treated with 
nivo+cabo and 4.17 months (min,max: 1.7, 12.3) for all confirmed responders treated with sunitinib at 
30-Mar-2020 database lock. The median DoR was longer for all confirmed responders treated with 
nivo+cabo than with sunitinib: 20.17 (95% CI: 17.31, N.A.) vs 11.47 (95% CI: 8.31, 18.43) months 
(Table 13). 84% and 73% of responders in the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, respectively, had a DoR of 
at least 6 months. 
The first post baseline tumor assessment was at 12 week per protocol.

Progression free survival-2 (PFS-2) 
Median PFS-2 per investigator was not reached in either treatment arms. HR favoured the nivo+ cabo 
arm over the sunitinib arm: 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.70). PFS-2 results in the two treatment arms are 
presented in the figure below.

Efficacy by PD-L1 
The efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of PD-L1 tumor cell expression 
status (< 1%, ≥ 1%) and across all efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS, ORR). 
Efficacy by Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) 
The efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of MDSC status at baseline 
(tertiles with 33.33% and 66.67% cut off) and across all efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS, and ORR) for both 
monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs.

PROs were assessed over the time of the study using valid and reliable scales: the NCCN Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-19) and a 3-level version of the EQ-5D. 
The FKSI-19 is a 19-item scale that measures tumour specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 
kidney cancer patients. The EQ-5D-3L is a generic measure used to assess treatment effects on perceived 
health status and to generate utility data for health economic evaluations. 
Analysis of the FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-3L was restricted to randomised subjects in Arm A and Arm C who 
had an assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. Both measures were 
completed on Day 1 of each treatment cycle (Q2W for nivo+cabo, Q6W for sunitinib) prior to any study 
related procedures. 
Questionnaire completion rate (number of subjects who filled the questionnaire/number of available 
subjects), mean score and mean change from baseline (for both total and subscale scores) at each 
assessment time point were analysed. 
For both the FKSI-19 and EQ-5D higher scores are indicative of better quality of life. Positive changes in 
score reflect improvement in HRQoL, while negative changes reflect a decrease in HRQoL. 
93.4% of subjects completed the FKSI-19 at baseline in the nivo+cabo arm while 97.2% of the sunitinib 
subjects had a baseline assessment. Completion rates were ≥ 80% in both treatment arms at all 
subsequent on-treatment assessments, through Week 105 for the nivo+cabo arm and Week 97 for the 
sunitinib arm.   
94.1% of subjects completed the EQ-5D-3L at baseline in the nivo+cabo arm while 97.5% of the sunitinib 
subjects had a baseline assessment. Completion rates were ≥ 80% in both treatment arms at all 
subsequent on-treatment assessments, through Week 105 for nivo+cabo and Week 97 for sunitinib, with 
the exception of the nivo+cabo arm at Week 93 (76.6%). 
Mean FKSI-19 total scores were 58.74 (SD: 10.57) in the nivo+cabo arm and 58.39 (SD: 9.92) in the 
sunitinib arm at baseline. Mean changes from baseline were generally stable for the nivo+cabo arm, 
whereas subjects in the sunitinib arm had a trend toward decreased scores. These changes are illustrated 
in the figure below.

Mean baseline scores for the EQ-5D VAS were 74.23 (SD: 22.23) in the nivo+cabo arm and 75.68 (SD: 
20.92) in the sunitinib arm. The mean EQ-5D VAS scores increased over time in the nivo+cabo arm, 
indicating better overall health status for subjects remaining on treatment. In the sunitinib arm, mean 
EQ-5D VAS scores varied with a decreased trend from Weeks 37-91. Results are summarised in the figure

A summary of the provided updated efficacy data is presented in Table 17, side by side with the results 
from the 30-Mar-2020 DBL, for reference. In a similar fashion (i.e. Sep-2020 DBL results side by side 
with Mar-2020 DBL results), Kaplan-Meier plots for PFS per BICR (primary definition), PFS per BICR 
(secondary definition), and OS are shown in  
Figure 16, Figure 17 and Figure 18. 
Also in the updated efficacy data, PFS benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score 
and tumour PD-L1 expression status. For the IMDC subgroups the original and updated PFS per BICR 
(primary definition) Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figure 19. For tumour PD-L1 expression status 
(≥1%, <1%) the updated results were (refer to or Figure 14 for the Mar-2020 DBL results): 
- 
PD-L1 ≥1%: median PFS was 13.08 vs 4.67 months, respectively, HR = 0.41 (95% CI: 0.27, 
0.61)

Subsequent anti-cancer treatment 
At the 10 Sep 2020 DBL, subsequent anti-cancer therapy (radiotherapy, surgery, and/or systemic 
therapy) was received by 84 patients (26.0%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared to 128 patients (39.0%) 
in the sunitinib arm. 
Subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 56 patients (17.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 
112 patients (34.1%) in the sunitinib arm. Subsequent immunotherapy (anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy, 
anti-CTLA4 therapy or the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4) was received by 20 patients (6.2%) 
in the nivo+cabo arm compared with 95 (29.0%) for the sunitinib arm. This included subsequent anti-
PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy in 13 patients (4.0%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared with 78 (23.8%) for the 
sunitinib arm. Subsequent antiangiogenic drugs were received by 44 patients (13.6%) in the nivo+cabo 
arm and 48 patients (14.6%) sunitinib arm.

Supportive studies 
Supportive studies to establish contribution of individual components 
To establish the contribution of the individual components nivolumab and cabozantinib to the nivo+cabo 
regimen, the MAH has compared the CA2099ER results to cabozantinib monotherapy data from the 
CABOSUN trial (Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology study A031203) and the METEOR trial. Nivolumab 
monotherapy data were gathered from Study CA209669. 
Contribution of nivolumab 
CABOSUN trial 
To justify the contribution of nivolumab monotherapy into the combination, the MAH is referring to the 
CABOSUN trial. It is a randomised Phase 2 study of cabozantinib vs sunitinib (total N=157) in participants 
with previously untreated intermediate (81%) or poor risk (19%) advanced RCC. This trial was the basis 
for approving the 1L indication of advanced RCC in patients with intermediate or poor risk for 
cabozantinib.  
Key efficacy results for CA2099ER and CABOSUN are presented in the table below: 
Table 18. Summary of efficacy in CA2099ER and CABOSUN- intermediate and poor risk 
population 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 71/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a Refer to Figure 5.30IP.3 (PFS), Figure 5.30IP.1 (OS), and Table 5.5IP.2 (ORR) of the CA2099ER Final 
CSR 
b Data presented as reported in Choueiri et al., Eur J Cancer. 2018; 94: 115. 
There was a cross-study difference in ORR between nivo+cabo (52.2%) and cabozantinib monotherapy 
(20%). The absolute ORR increase in CA2099ER was 29% (52.2% in the nivo+cabo arm minus 23.0% in 
the sunitinib arm) vs 11% (20% in the cabozantinib arm minus 9% in the sunitinib arm) in CABOSUN. 
There was an increase in median PFS in CA2099ER, compared to the 3.3 month increase in CABOSUN, 
however a similar HR of 0.48 was achieved in both trials. 
Baseline characteristics in the CABOSUN trial were similar to study CA2099ER, except for the lack of 
favorable risk patients (data not shown). As the CABOSUN-population had poorer prognosis, the effect 
size is expected to be lower than in the CA2099ER. The comparator, sunitinib, was identical in the two 
trials. 
METEOR trial 
To establish that the contribution of components demonstrated also accounts for 1L favorable risk 
participants, additional supportive data from the METEOR study were provided to compare the effect of 
cabozantinib monotherapy in the favorable population to the intermediate or poor risk populations. 
METEOR was a randomised, open-label, Phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy of cabozantinib, as 
compared with everolimus, in patients with RCC who had progressed after VEGFR-targeted therapy. This 
study formed the basis for the approval of this 2L indication in RCC for cabozantinib. The primary 
endpoint was PFS as assessed by BICR and secondary endpoints were OS and ORR. Cabozantinib 
treatment resulted in improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared with everolimus across all IMDC risk groups. 
ORR from cabozantinib monotherapy in METEOR was similar between the favorable risk subgroup and the 
intermediate and poor risk subgroups: 16.7%, 19.0% and 11.1%, respectively, see table below. 
Table 19. Summary of efficacy in METEOR across IMDC risk categories 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 72/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The baseline population in the METEOR trial and the CA2099ER trial differs significantly in the sense of 
treatment line (METEOR 2L+, CA2099ER 1L). Of note, 64% of the cabozantinib patients in the METEOR 
trial had used sunitinib previously and the comparator was everolimus.  
Contribution of cabozantinib 
Nivolumab is not approved for the use in the 1L RCC population as monotherapy (MA only granted for 
nivolumab monotherapy after prior therapy in RCC, 2L+).  
To justify the contribution of cabozantinib, the MAH provided a comparison of the data from the nivo + 
cabo combination in CA2099ER with nivolumab monotherapy data from Study CA209669. The CA209669 
study is an ongoing Investigator-sponsored, single-arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of nivolumab monotherapy in previously untreated advanced RCC (n=123), as well as the efficacy 
of nivolumab + ipilimumab salvage therapy in participants with tumours resistant to initial nivolumab 
monotherapy. Study CA209669 included all IMDC risk groups. Only results from the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm were presented. There was a cross-study difference in ORR between nivo+cabo 
(55.7%, 95% CI [50.1, 61.2]) and nivolumab monotherapy (31.7%, 95% CI [23.6, 40.7]), with non-
overlapping 95% CIs. 
The CA209669 is still ongoing. Baseline characteristics were similar among studies, except for the higher 
proportion of poor risk subjects enrolled in CA2099ER compared with CA209669 (18.6% vs 9.8%). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study CA2099ER was the main study submitted for the extension of indication to include the use of 
cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
Selected data from CABOSUN trial (cabozantinib vs sunitinib in 1L RCC), study CA209669 (single-arm 
nivolumab [salvage nivolumab + ipilimumab] 1L RCC) and the METEOR trial (cabozantinib vs everolimus 
in 2L+ RCC) have been included as supportive with the aim to provide justification on the contribution of 
each of the components to the efficacy of the nivolumab + cabozantinib combination. To support the 
choice of the proposed reduced cabozantinib dose in the combination (40 mg) a dose finding phase 1b/2 
trial (CTEP-9861) is submitted.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design and patient population 
Study CA2099ER is an open label, randomised, Phase 3 trial comparing nivolumab 240 mg Q2W 
combined with cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily [nivo + cabo; Arm A] versus sunitinib 50 mg orally 
QD (4 weeks, 2 weeks off) [Arm C] in participants with previously untreated (first line) advanced or 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  
Subjects ≥18 years of age and who had previously untreated advanced RCC (not amenable for surgery or 
radiotherapy) or metastatic RRC, with histology confirmed RCC with clear cell component with or without 
sarcomatoid features, were eligible provided they had not received prior systemic therapy for advanced 
RCC. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for RCC was acceptable if completed ≥ 6 months prior to 
randomisation. No crossover was allowed.  
It is also noted that some medicinal-product-specific exclusion criteria did apply. The most important 
ones have been reflected in the respective SmPCs: patients with an autoimmune disease or any condition 
requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications (nivolumab 
specific); and patients receiving concomitant treatment with anticoagulants (cabozantinib specific). 
Additionally, patients with any active brain metastases were excluded.  
Only patients with RCC with a clear-cell component were eligible for CA2099ER. Only a few (three) 
patients were documented to also have non-clear cell component. Even if patients with only non-clear cell 
RCC were not included in the trial, they were not excluded from the sought indication, which is acceptable 
because cabozantinib has shown efficacy in non-clear cell RCC in a retrospective study (Martinez Chanzá 
et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019).  
Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumour expression, however, it was used as a stratification 
factor (≥ 1% vs < 1%). Subgroup analyses according to PD-L1 expression have been included in the 
protocol. 
In addition to PD-L1 tumour expression, participants were also stratified according to International 
Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group (favourable, intermediate and poor) and 
geographic region (North America and Western Europe and Northern Europe vs rest of the world [ROW]). 
Stratification factors are considered appropriate. 
Inclusion across all three IMDC risk categories results in heterogeneity of the patient population in terms 
of prognosis. It is a fact that two other similar combination regimens (PD-L1-inhibitor + TKI; 
pembrolizumab +axitinib and avelumab +axitinib) are already approved across all three IMDC risk 
categories. Stratified subgroup analyses by IMDC risk categories have been included in the protocol. 
Sunitinib is considered to be an acceptable comparator in the target population as the study started 
inclusion in 2017. The shift to new standard of care in first line RCC across IMDC risk categories to 
combination regimens (pembrolizumab + axitinib [all risk categories] or nivolumab + ipilimumab 
[intermediate and poor risk categories]) occurred in European guidelines (ESMO, EAU) during 2018 and 
2019.  
The patient population was adequate and inclusion/exclusion criteria are acceptable. The open-label 
design is acceptable on the basis of the different administration route and schedule of administration. The 
assessment of response has been performed based on blinded independent central review (BICR). BICR 
reviewed tumour assessments scans for all randomised participants to determine RECIST v1.1 response 
for the analysis of PFS and ORR. 
Overall, the study design is considered acceptable.

Study endpoints and statistics 
The primary objectives of the study were to compare PFS per BICR in participants treated with nivolumab 
+ cabozantinib (Arm A) vs sunitinib (Arm C). OS, ORR, DoR, and safety were secondary outcomes. 
PFS as primary objective is considered appropriate considering OS was defined as a secondary objective. 
The MAH has evaluated PFS based on two definitions. The primary definition entailed censoring for 
subsequent therapy while the secondary definition was irrespective of subsequent therapy and did not 
account for it. According to the EMA Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer treatment medicinal 
products in man, Appendix 1 (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev1) it is the secondary definition of PFS used in 
the pivotal trial that is recommended. Starting new anti-cancer treatment cannot be assumed to be non-
informative and therefore censored.  
All analyses (apart from dosing and safety) were to be carried out using the treatment arm as 
randomised (intent to treat). Overall, the statistical analyses are considered appropriate and the sample 
size calculations are acceptable. 
Cabozantinib dose 
A formal Phase II dose-finding study in order to support the proposed lower dose of 40 mg daily has not 
been conducted. The dose selection of cabo+nivo is rather based on an investigator-initiated Phase I trial 
(CTEP-9681) evaluating the combination of cabo+nivo or cabo+nivo+ipi in patients with genitourinary 
cancers (including RCC). The primary objective was to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of cabo+nivo (and cabo+nivo+ipi). There was 
only one RCC patient included in the cabo+nivo dose cohort, thus efficacy was not assessed. As expected, 
no DLTs were reported during the first 4 weeks of therapy. For molecularly targeted agents, such as 
cabozantinib, it is common that patients present grade 3-4 toxicity after cycle 1. The RP2D (40 mg 
cabozantinib QD co-administered with 3 mg/kg nivo Q2W) was therefore selected based on cabozantinib 
dose reductions past the first 4 weeks of therapy. Four (4) of 12 (33%) patients starting with 40 mg 
cabozantinib had dose reductions, compared to 9 of 12 (75%) patients starting with 60 mg cabozantinib. 
Albeit a limited number of subjects, there were somewhat more subjects with treatment related adverse 
events (TRAEs) of any grade in the 60 mg groups compared to 40 mg groups. This supports that the 40 
mg dose may be more tolerable than 60 mg dose in combination with nivolumab.  
In the pivotal CA2099ER trial, dose modifications were abundant. The majority of subjects had 
cabozantinib dose interruptions (68%) and dose reductions (51%) due to adverse events (see section 2.5 
for further discussion on safety profile and dose-reductions). The limited data from CTEP-9681 indicate 
that an even lower cabozantinib starting dose could have reduced the risk of adverse events. This is also 
supported by previous exposure-response analyses in cabozantinib RCC monotherapy where higher 
exposure has been linked with increased risks of adverse events and dose reductions. It is unknown 
whether a lower cabozantinib dose could have resulted in similar efficacy, but it is likely that the risk of 
AEs would be reduced. Thus, a lower cabozantinib starting dose may provide a better benefit-risk profile 
in RCC patients co-treated with nivolumab. The MAH is recommended to investigate lower dose levels for 
cabozantinib in future studies both in monotherapy and when co-administered with nivolumab or other 
agents [REC]. 
For nivolumab, the MAH proposes two doses: 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W iv. At the time of the 
CA2099ER protocol initiation, nivolumab 240 mg Q2W flat dose had been shown to be comparable to 
3 mg/kg Q2W in multiple tumour types, including RCC (2L). As the 480 mg Q4W dose was not approved 
at the time of the initiation of study CA2099ER, this dose was not explored in the pivotal study. The doses 
of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W have been accepted to have a similar 
benefit-risk balance for treatment of melanoma and RCC (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0036/G).

Originally, an Arm B was included in study CA2099ER, intended for studying the triplet cabo+nivo+ipi. 
However, this arm was later removed from the study protocol due to incoming data from the CA209314 
trial demonstrating superior OS with nivo + ipi compared to sunitinib in the 1L RCC population. At the 
time of the revised protocol version 01, 15 participants had been randomised to CA2099ER (5, 4 and 6 
participants to Arm A, B and C respectively). Revised protocol v.01 was implemented at the sites when 
approved locally. Thus, a delay occurred from the date of the new protocol version (18-Dec-2017) to the 
implementation at the last site (Sep-2018). Fifty (50) participants had been randomised to Arm B before 
the revised protocol was implemented on all study sites due to a delay of revised protocol 
implementation. According to the MAH, the delay was mainly due to dependence on the national approval 
process before implementation. The national approval process in one particular site in Mexico was 
particularly slow. At the same time, the protocol was also amended to include participants with favourable 
risk (according to IMDC criteria) into the study. The statistical analysis plan was updated with respect to 
the two protocol amendments well before database lock (30-Mar-2020) and subsequent availability of 
unblinded data, which is reassuring. Patients allocated to Arm B continued with the triplet-treatment per 
protocol version 00, and planned clinical evaluation per protocol. Data collected for subjects in Arm B are 
included in the dataset, however, not included in the “Analysed population”- see section Numbers 
Analysed. 
The total number of subjects with significant protocol deviations was 149 (46.2%) in Arm A and 126 
(38.5%) in Arm C. In total, 61 protocol deviations (31 in Arm A vs. 30 in Arm C) in the “failure to obtain 
written consent prior to each subject’s participation in the study” category were registered. All 
randomised subjects signed an initial consent, thus most of these deviations were related to delays in re-
consenting of updated written consent. Two sites, in Mexico and Chile respectively, reported a higher 
number of protocol deviations due to delayed implementation of protocol changes and failure to obtain 
written consent prior to participation in the study. According to the MAH, these PDs occurred due to lack 
of experience and unsatisfactory GCP routines on site. Still, it appears that the training of the PIs and the 
staff has been acceptable. Of note is that one (0.3%) subject in the experimental arm (nivo + cabo) 
received prohibited prior anti-cancer therapy with pazopanib in adjuvant therapy setting. No subjects 
were excluded from the intent to treat (ITT) analyses. Furthermore, there were also violations on basic 
rules of GCP such as failure to report all SAEs in accordance with the time period required and 
implementation of protocol changes prior to review by IRB/IEC. However, the number of these cases was 
low. The MAH has also satisfactorily justified that these significant PDs had no impact on trial results or 
interpretation. Overall, it is considered there is no impact on the overall data quality and integrity of the 
study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cut-off date for the primary data analysis in the CA2099ER study occurred on 12-Feb-2020. The 
median duration of follow-up (date of randomisation to the last known date alive or death date) was 
approximately 15.7 months for the nivo + cabo arm and 14.59 months for the sunitinib arm. By database 
lock (DBL) on 30-Mar-2020, the minimum and median follow-up for OS was approximately 10.6 and 
18.1 months, respectively.  
Baseline and disease characteristics 
In general, the ITT population’s baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms, and 
the enrolled population is overall representative for the intended patients population. The percentage of 
participants in the IMDC risk categories of favourable, intermediate and poor risk was 22.6%, 57.6% and 
19.7%, respectively, which reflects, in general, what is observed in clinical practice. A total of 24.9% of 
participants had tumor tissue PD-L1 expression score ≥ 1%. 11.5% of the participants had sarcomatoid 
features in the confirmed histology, and were well balanced between Arm A and C.

There was more extensive use of corticosteroids in the cabo + nivo arm, this is as expected due to more 
immune related toxicity in this arm. High dose corticosteroids were administered to approximately 20% of 
nivo+cabo treated subjects with immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) or Select AEs. Approximately 
10% received high dose corticosteroids for a duration of at least 2 weeks and approximately 4% received 
high dose for a duration of at least 30 days.  
Administration of systemic corticosteroids might decrease the AUC of cabozantinib by 20-50% via CYP3A4 
induction. The potential clinical impact of lower exposure cannot be ascertained since cabozantinib 
exposure-response relationships are undetermined.  
The impact of the use of systemic corticosteroids on cabozantinib exposure and efficacy cannot be 
concluded based on a post-hoc analysis in a small subgroup in the pivotal trial (data not shown). 
Exploratory data from nivolumab trials, support the assumption that concomitant use of corticosteroids 
has no detrimental effect on nivolumab efficacy. No such data is available for cabozantinib. The SmPC 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 reflect that use of concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 should be avoided.   
Primary endpoint: PFS 
At the original DBL 30-Mar-2020, a statistically significant benefit in PFS (secondary definition) was 
observed for nivolumab + cabozantinib over sunitinib (HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.67; p < 0.0001) with 
159 (49.2%) and 211 (64.3%) events in the experimental and the control arm, respectively. The main 
reason for censoring was ongoing without event (48.6% in the nivo + cabo arm vs 29.9% in the sunitinib 
arm), no tumour assessment on-study (1.5% and 4%, respectively) and no baseline tumour assessment 
(0.6% and 1.8%, respectively). Of the patients censored due to no event, the majority was still on 
treatment (42.4% in the experimental arm vs 19.5% in the control arm). 
The median PFS (nivo + cabo vs sunitinib) was 14.29 (95%CI: 12.29, 19.84) vs 8.31 (95%CI: 7.00, 
9.69) months. Separation of the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves favoring nivo+cabo occurred early, and with 
no crossing of the curves. A lot of censoring is observed from approximately month 10-11. 
Results from a sensitivity analysis of PFS using stratification factors as determined at baseline (CRF 
source) and a multivariate analysis (adjusting for several baseline factors) were consistent with the 
primary PFS analysis (both in regards to the primary and the secondary definition of PFS).  
The MAH provided updated data with a 10-Sep-2020 DBL, corresponding to a minimum follow-up of 16.0 
months (instead of 10.6) and a median follow-up of 23.5 months (instead of 18.1 months).  
The updated PFS data were consistent with the primary data and thus confirmed the PFS benefit of 
nivo+cabo over sunitinib ( 
Figure 16 and Figure 17). Updated PFS results using the secondary definition were also consistent. At 
the 10-Sep-2020 DBL the difference between median PFS using the secondary vs the primary definition 
has decreased, aligning PFS results across definitions.   
At the original DBL 30-Mar-2020, a benefit in PFS favouring the cabo + nivo arm was seen across the 
three pre-specified stratification categories: baseline IMDC prognostic score, PD-L1 tumor expression and 
region. However, median PFS was not reached in the favourable IMDC risk group in the nivo + cabo arm 
(event-rate 40.5%). For both the intermediate and poor risk groups median PFS was reached and the 
event-rates were slightly higher for the cabo+nivo arm (43.9% and 51.7%, respectively). Although a 
benefit in favour of the experimental arm was observed in the favourable risk group (HR = 0.60 [95% CI: 
0.37, 0.98], per CRF), the immaturity of the data contributed to an uncertainty in the interpretation of 
the primary endpoint results for this subgroup. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 77/131 
 
 
 
 
The updated data showed a benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score for PFS. Also for the favourable risk group, the PFS result remained clearly favourable (HR = 0.58 
[95% CI: 0.36, 0.93] and median PFS was reached with 24.71 months in the nivo+cabo group vs 12.81 
months in the sunitinib group. 
A benefit in PFS in favour of the cabo + nivo arm was also seen across most other subgroups, except in 
Asian participants (7.8% of ITT, n = 51). It was concluded that the subgroup of Asian patients is too 
small and the number of PFS events is too limited to draw any firm conclusions that would question the 
clinical benefit of nivo+cabo in this subgroup (see below also). Of note, in the pivotal avelumab + axitinib 
study there was no discordance of efficacy results for the subgroup of Asian patients (n=133; 15.0% of 
full analysis set; Bavencio + Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR). 
Of note, the PFS benefit was also observed in the subgroup of patients with sarcomatoid features in the 
tumor (11.5% of ITT).  
Secondary endpoints: 
OS 
At the original DBL 30-Mar-2020, a statistically significant benefit was observed in the ITT population for 
nivolumab + cabozantinib over sunitinib (HR 0.60; 95%CI: 0.40, 0.89, p = 0.0010). There were 67 
(20.7%) events in the experimental arm and 99 (30.2%) events in the control arm. The median OS was 
not reached in either study arm. The estimated percentage of patients who was alive at 9 months was 
89.9% (95%CI: 86.0, 92.8) in the nivo + cabo arm and 80.5% (95%CI: 75.7, 84.4) in the sunitinib arm. 
The K-M curves for the two treatment arms seem to separate early with no crossing of the curves, and no 
detrimental effect is expected. Updated OS data were provided with DBL 10-Sep-2020 with an event rate 
of 26.6% in the nivo+cabo vs 35.4% in the sunitinib arm. Median OS was still not reached in nivo+cabo 
arm. Overall, these data were consistent with the primary data (Figure 18). 
A benefit in OS in favour of the cabo + nivo arm was observed across the three pre-specified stratification 
categories: baseline IMDC prognostic score, PD-L1 tumour expression and region. However, median OS 
was not reached in the majority of the subgroups, and based on the DBL 30-Mar-2020, the data were 
considered too immature to draw any definitive conclusions.  
The updated data showed a benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score although, the OS HR for IMDC favourable-risk patients increased slightly, i.e. from 0.84 (30-Mar-
2020 DBL) to 0.94 (10-Sep-2020 DBL) raising uncertainty on the OS benefit in this subgroup. However, 
updated OS data for this subgroup remain immature with only 15/74 vs 15/72 deaths/patients, 
respectively.  Furthermore, there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS in this subgroup, the PFS result 
remained clearly favourable for this subgroup (HR = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.93]; median PFS 24.71 vs 
12.81 months) and ORR provided support (66.2% vs 44.4%, respectively). 
Only in the small subgroup of Asian patients (n=51) and the small subgroup of patients ≥75 years of age 
(n=62) did the point estimate of the OS HR (numerically) favour sunitinib (i.e. 3.83 and 1.05, 
respectively). The 95% CI for OS HR was, however, wide for both these subgroups and, importantly, did 
encompass unity (‘1’). It is also considered that the subgroup of Asian patients is too small and the 
number of deaths (4 vs 1, respectively) too few to question the clinical benefit of nivo+cabo in this 
subgroup. Of note, ORR results did favour nivo+cabo in this subgroup. 
ORR 
The objective responses rate based on BICR assessment favoured the nivo + cabo arm, 55.7% (95%CI: 
50.1, 61.2) vs 27.1% (95%CI: 22.4, 32.3) in the sunitinib arm, and was irrespective of PD-L1 
expression, IMDC risk group and region (original DBL 30-Mar-2020). 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 78/131 
 
 
 
 
The updated ORR and DoR results were consistent with the original data (Table 17). 
The updated data for ORR also showed a benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib regardless of baseline IMDC 
prognostic score. 
The median time to response (TTR) per BICR was 2.83 months (min, max: 1.0, 19.4) for all confirmed 
responders in the nivo + cabo arm and 4.17 months (min, max: 1.7, 12.3) for all confirmed responders in 
the sunitinib arm. 
The median duration of response (DoR) favoured the participants treated in the nivo + cabo arm over the 
sunitinib arm: 20.17 months (95% CI: 17.31, N.A.) vs 11.47 months (95% CI: 8.31, 18.43).  
Exploratory endpoints 
PFS-2: At the original DBL 30-Mar-2020, median PFS-2 per investigator was not reached in either 
treatment arm. HR favoured the nivo+ cabo arm over the sunitinib arm: 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.70). 
Thus, there seems to be no detrimental impact of first-line treatment with the combination of nivolumab 
and cabozantinib on subsequent benefit from second-line treatments. Updated data were provided (event 
rate nivo+cabo: 30.3%; sunitinib: 42.4%; median PFS2 not reached in nivo+cabo arm) and these were 
consistent with the primary PFS2 data (data not shown). The interpretation of PFS-2 is hampered as the 
second-line treatment was not predefined per protocol. 
HRQoL: 
Even though PROs were captured through the use of two validated questionnaires (FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-
3L), the HRQoL results are considered of a descriptive, hypothesis-generating nature only. It is, 
nevertheless, noted that patients in the sunitinib arm had a trend toward decreased scores/decline, 
whereas the patients in the nivo+cabo arm did not. 
Biomarkers 
Across all above efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS, and ORR), an efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was 
observed regardless of tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%). This is in line with the results 
of the three recently approved ICI combinations in the 1L RCC setting (Moscetti et al. ESMO Open. 2020). 
The updated efficacy data (PFS and OS) for the PD-L1 expression status subgroups confirmed the original 
results. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients: study CA2099ER included 250 patients (38.4%) ≥65 years of age and 62 patients 
(9.5%) ≥75 years of age. This is acceptable. 
Contribution of each component in the combination regimen 
The clinical trial design of the study CA2099ER is lacking a monotherapy arm, testing the combination 
(cabozantinib + nivolumab) against either of the two components of the combination. This leads to 
uncertainties when it comes to reaching a conclusion on the contribution of each agent to the 
combination. The MAH has presented several cross-trial comparisons to address this issue.  
To justify the efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy in the 1st line RCC population, the MAH presented an 
investigator sponsored single arm phase 2 trial (CA209669) in RCC across all IMDC groups, which is still 
ongoing. The results from this study also serve the purpose of justifying the contribution of cabozantinib 
into the combination. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab 
monotherapy in the previously untreated RCC population, as well as the efficacy and safety of nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab as salvage therapy in participants with tumors resistant to initial nivolumab monotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 79/131 
 
 
 
 
Of note, nivolumab is currently not approved as monotherapy for 1st line treatment in advanced RCC but 
only as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced RCC after prior therapy.  
Based on the cross-trial difference observed in pooled ORR in favor of the nivo + cabo combination, the 
add-on activity of cabozantinib to nivolumab monotherapy can be supported. The provided data are 
indicative of an increase in ORR when cabozantinib is combined with nivolumab. As the nivolumab single-
arm study in totality is small, the number of patients in each IMDC risk group becomes limited and it is 
not possible to conclude on the efficacy of nivolumab for each of these subgroups with certainty. 
The benefit of cabozantinib monotherapy (thus, contribution of nivolumab into the combination) as 1st line 
treatment of RCC is justified by the CABOSUN trial. This was a Phase 2 trial comparing cabozantinib and 
sunitinib as 1st line treatment of patients with RCC leading to the approval of cabozantinib in the 
intermediate and poor risk population. Based on the cross trial increased ORR, the add-on tumor activity 
of nivolumab to cabozantinib monotherapy in patients with intermediate and poor risk can be supported. 
To establish that the demonstrated contribution of components can be extrapolated to the 1st line 
favourable risk population, additional supportive data from the METEOR study were provided to compare 
the efficacy in the favourable risk population to the intermediate and poor risk populations. The METEOR 
trial was an open label trial in 2nd line plus patients that evaluated the efficacy of cabozantinib 
monotherapy compared with everolimus after progression on VEGF-targeted therapy. The differences in 
the patient populations greatly hamper the cross-study comparison between METEOR and CA2099ER. 
Even though the ORR was demonstrated to be similar across risk groups in METEOR, given all the 
limitations in this comparison, the justification of the extrapolation from data obtained in a 2L setting to a 
first line setting is deficient.  
The lack of data on 1st line efficacy for Cabometyx in the favourable risk group is a fact. However, despite 
this uncertainty, the totality of the submitted data provide sufficient support of the efficacy for 
Cabometyx in the favourable risk group. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single pivotal study CA2099ER, the nivo+cabo combination demonstrated a clinically 
relevant and statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared 
with sunitinib treatment. This result was robust as results of all sensitivity analyses and of the analysis of 
PFS according to the secondary definition in line with the EMA/CHMP guideline  were consistent with the 
primary analysis. Nivo+cabo also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the secondary 
endpoints OS and ORR (per BICR) compared with sunitinib. 
An efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score 
and tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%). 
Updated results (10-Sep-20 DBL) were confirmative but remain somewhat immature regarding OS. Thus, 
there remains some uncertainty regarding an OS benefit, particularly in the subgroup of IMDC favourable-
risk patients. This is, however, acceptable as there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS in any 
subgroup, including the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients that has clearly favourable PFS results 
with support from ORR. 
Regarding the contribution of the individual components, the additive efficacy of both individual 
components has been shown in a qualitative sense based primarily on an increase in ORR over the 
individual agents. This is considered acceptable despite the limitations of cross-study comparisons.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The previously EU-approved indications for cabozantinib (monotherapy) in advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) include treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor risk, and adults following prior VEGF-
targeted therapy. The recommended dose is 60 mg cabozantinib PO QD (by mouth, once daily).  
The safety profile of cabozantinib in the approved RCC indications is largely similar to other approved 
VEGFR-TKIs (e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib, regorafenib). The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade 
(experienced by at least 25% of patients) include diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, PPES, 
hypertension, weight decreased, vomiting, dysgeusia, constipation, and AST increased. Hypertension was 
observed more frequently in the treatment naïve RCC population (67%) compared to RCC patients 
following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (37%). The most common serious adverse reactions (SAEs) 
associated with cabozantinib in the RCC population (frequency ≥1%) are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
nausea, hypertension, embolism, hyponatraemia, pulmonary embolism, vomiting, dehydration, fatigue, 
asthenia, decreased appetite, deep vein thrombosis, dizziness, hypomagnesaemia and PPES.  
The known safety profile of nivolumab includes fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints (including diarrhoea 
and nausea), and multiple immune-related AEs, including immune-related pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, 
nephritis, rash, and endocrinopathies (including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, and diabetic ketoacidosis). 
The safety data presented here, in support of the new indication, are derived from 320 subjects treated 
with nivolumab +cabozantinib (nivo+cabo) in the ongoing CA2099ER study. The data are based on a 
30 March 2020 database lock (DBL) with minimum 10.6 months of follow-up for overall survival. Updated 
safety data were submitted (DBL 10 September 2020), and are presented separately, as indicated.  
In order to characterise the contribution of each drug to the safety profile of the nivo+cabo combination, 
the most common adverse events reported for the combination are presented in the context of available 
monotherapy data for nivolumab and cabozantinib in RCC indications as listed in Table 20.

Patient exposure 
Overall, 1003 subjects were enrolled and 701 were randomized, including 323 to the nivo+cabo arm (Arm 
A), 328 to the sunitinib arm (Arm C), and 50 to the nivo+ipi+cabo arm (Arm B). Of the 651 randomized 
subjects in the nivo+cabo (N = 323) and sunitinib (N = 328) arms, 640 subjects were treated: 320 with 
nivo+cabo and 320 with sunitinib. At the time of the first DBL, study treatment was ongoing in 55.6% of 
the subjects treated with nivo+cabo and 28.8% with sunitinib. The data for study arm B have not been 
provided.

Adverse events 
Safety data (AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, laboratory abnormalities, Select AEs for 
nivolumab, Events to Monitor for cabozantinib) from the all treated population (subjects who received 
at least one dose of any study medication) in the pivotal CA2099ER study is presented, including a 
safety window of 30 days after the last dose, with the intention of safety characterisation without 
influence of AEs associated with subsequent therapies. In addition, reported immune-mediated AEs 
(IMAEs) and other events of special interest (OESI) associated with the use of nivolumab are analysed 
within 100 days of the last dose (see section on other significant events below).

Table 28. Assessment of Most Common All Causality AEs (>20%) in CA2099ER and Occurrence 
with Monotherapies 
Exposure-adjusted AE summary 
When incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, all-causality AE incidence rates (events per 100 person-
years) were 1705.2 in the nivo+cabo treatment arm and 1852.6 in the sunitinib arm. The following was 
noted when comparing exposure-adjusted event data with non-exposure adjusted event data: 
• AEs of diarrhoea, AST/ALT increased and hepatotoxicity, and rash remain more frequent in the 
nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm in the exposure-adjusted event data also. 
• In the exposure-adjusted data, relatively more events in Investigations, General disorders and 
administration site conditions (mainly due to fatigue), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (mainly 
due to a relative increase in PPE and rash), Nervous system disorders and Vascular disorders were 
counted in the sunitinib arm compared to the nivo+cabo arm, while the rate of events was comparable 
across the two study arms or higher in the nivo+cabo arm in the non-exposure adjusted event data. 
Drug-related AEs 
Causal relationship to study drug was determined by the investigator and assessed as related (there is a 
reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and AE) or not related (there is not a 
reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and AE).

Selection of specific adverse reactions from study CA2099ER to be presented in the proposed SmPC 
(Sections 4.4 and 4.8) for nivo+cabo was based on clinical relevance as determined by the Sponsor’s 
medical reviewer. PTs considered to be related to either nivolumab or cabozantinib monotherapy as 
shown in the respective SmPCs, and found to be related events (or not assessed) by the investigator for 
the combination of nivo+cabo, were selected for inclusion into the tabulated list for nivo+cabo in Section 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021

4.8 of the SmPC. Certain terms were excluded from the list of related events. These were events which 
were overly general/non-specific, events where the sponsor’s medical reviewer did not suspect causal 
relationship to cabozantinib or nivolumab, and events which were captured under a different term. 
In addition, laboratory values worsening from baseline for PTs in which laboratory testing was performed 
routinely in CA2099ER per protocol were considered for inclusion. 
Updated safety data DBL Sep-2020 
The median duration (defined as last dose date - start dose date + 1 day) of nivo+cabo was 
17.99 months (16.13 months for nivolumab; 17.30 months for cabozantinib), and 9.15 months for 
sunitinib at the Sep-2020 DBL. Study treatment was ongoing in 45.0% of subjects treated with 
nivo+cabo and 22.2% with sunitinib. The median number of doses received during the treatment period 
was as follows nivo+cabo arm: 34.0 doses nivolumab, 417.5 doses cabozantinib, sunitinib arm: 166.0 
doses sunitinib. 
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of subjects with ≥1 dose delay) were as follows, as reported on the 
exposure page of the CRF: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo arm: 73.1% of subjects had delays for nivolumab only, 81.9% for cabozantinib only, 
and 89.4% for either nivolumab or cabozantinib  
Sunitinib arm: 72.8% had dose delays 
Dose reductions (subjects with ≥1 dose reduction) were as follows, as reported on the exposure page of 
the CRF: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo arm: 59.4% had dose reductions of cabozantinib 
Sunitinib arm: 52.5% had dose reductions of sunitinib. 
As of the Sep-2020 lock, there remained only one death reported due to study drug in the nivo+cabo 
treatment arm; the verbatim term for the cause of death per investigator was small intestine perforation. 
The proportion of patients experiencing all causality AEs leading to discontinuation was 31.6% (drug-
related 23.4%).  In the below table a summary of safety data from the March 2020 and September 2020 
cut-off is shown.

Other Significant Events 
Select Adverse Events, Immune-mediated Adverse Events and Other Adverse Events of Special 
Interest for nivolumab 
To characterise adverse events of special clinical interest that may be associated with nivolumab, the 
MAH has defined and analysed several categories of AEs: Select AEs, Immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs), 
Other events of special interest (OESI).  
Select adverse events (endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, 
rash, hypersensitivity/infusion reactions) are currently considered as select AEs, based on the following 
principles: AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies; 
AEs that may require immunosuppression (eg, corticosteroids) as part of their management; AEs whose 
early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity; AEs for which multiple event terms may 
be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating the pooling of terms for full 
characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were analyzed along with the select AE categories 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 97/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
because multiple event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling of terms was, therefore, 
necessary for full characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be 
considered select AEs. Events occurring within 30 days of the last dose were included. 
Analysis of immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) included events (regardless of causality) for 
which subjects received immune-modulating medicines for treatment of the event, except for endocrine 
events which were included in the analysis regardless of treatment since these events are often managed 
without immunosuppression. The analysis also included events where the investigator identified them as 
IMAEs due to no clear alternate pathology and an immune mediated component was present. Events 
occurring within 100 days of the last dose were included. 
In order to capture Other events of special interest (OESI) that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as 
IMAEs or Select AEs, and which may be associated with the use of cancer immunotherapy and require 
immunosuppression as part of their management, the following categories of AEs were defined: 
demyelination, encephalitis, Gullain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, pancreatitis, uveitis, 
myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyelosis. Events occurring within 100 days of the last dose were 
included.

Events to Monitor for Cabozantinib 
To track events likely to be associated with the use of cabozantinib, a set of events to monitor (ETMs) 
were defined that are known to be associated with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or vascular 
endothelial growth factor pathway inhibition and that may have potentially serious consequences or that 
have been determined to warrant ongoing routine surveillance.  
These comprise GI perforation, abscess, intra-abdominal and pelvic abscess, fistula, wound complication, 
osteonecrosis, Grade ≥3 hemorrhage, hypertension, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome (PPES), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), arterial thromboembolic events, 
venous and mixed thromboembolic events, QT prolongation, renal failure, and hepatotoxicity. 
Each ETM is a grouped clinical term comprising a broad set of AEs that are related pathophysiologically. 
The search methods used to identify the AEs grouped within each ETM vary between ETMs and may 
include one or more of the following: standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs), keyword searches of 
MedDRA PTs, and predefined lists of relevant PTs. ETMs for cabozantinib are shown in Table 42 (modified 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 101/131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to show only associated PTs occurring in ≥2 subjects in the nivo+cabo treatment arm). Not all PTs for a 
given ETM have been reported for subjects receiving cabozantinib.

Overlapping AEs 
Hepatotoxicity (ALT/AST increases, and select hepatic events), diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and rash are 
part of the known safety profiles of both nivolumab and cabozantinib (ie, overlapping AEs). The higher 
frequencies and/or severities of these AEs with nivo+cabo observed in CA2099ER in comparison with the 
nivolumab and cabozantinib as monotherapies (and higher vs the sunitinib arm within CA2099ER), 
acknowledging the different doses of cabozantinib among the compared studies, suggest potentially 
additive effects of the two drugs when used in combination; these 4 terms are therefore assessed in more 
detail below. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity in CA2099ER was assessed by several methods including the Select hepatic AE category 
which comprises the following PTs: hepatotoxicity, ALT increased, AST increased, blood alkaline 
phosphatase increased, gammaglutamyl transferase increased, autoimmune hepatitis, blood bilirubin 
increased, drug induced liver injury, hepatic enzyme increased, hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, liver 
function test increased, liver function test abnormal, transaminases increased, hepatic failure. Unlike the 
ETM of hepatotoxicity, the Select hepatic AE category definition accounts for increases in transaminases, 
among other types of hepatic events, and may more comprehensively represent the incidence of 
hepatotoxicity than an all-causality SOC of hepatobiliary disorders or laboratory test results 
independently. The assessment of hepatotoxicity with the nivo+cabo combination in relation to the 
monotherapy components took into consideration the differences among nivolumab and cabozantinib 
monotherapy studies and the fact that the comprehensive hepatic ‘select AE’ grouping was not utilized 
across monotherapy studies, but only for nivolumab monotherapy in 2L+ RCC (CA209025). Laboratory 
test abnormalities (worsening from baseline) (ie, increased ALT and AST lab values) may be the most 
direct and objective measurements of hepatotoxicity, and therefore most relevant in relation to assessing 
the hepatic safety profile of the combination and the handling of dose modifications by the investigator 
for severe events.

Diarrhoea 
In CA2099ER, all-causality AEs in the PT ‘diarrhea’ occurred in the nivo+cabo treatment arm with a 
frequency of 63.8% (any grade); 6.9% (Grade 3-4) (Table 27). In comparison, in the nivolumab 
monotherapy trials CA209205 and CA209669 and the cabozantinib monotherapy trials METEOR and 
CABOSUN, all-causality AEs of diarrhoea occurred with a frequency of 23.6%, 30.9%, 74% and 73%, 
respectively; grade 3-4: 1.2%, 3,3%, 11% and 10%, respectively.  
Most all causality AEs of diarrhoea with nivo+cabo were considered drug-related (56.9%) by the 
investigator (Table 29). Very few diarrhoea events (0.6%) led to discontinuation of treatment (Table 56). 
11 subjects (3.4%) in the nivo+cabo arm had a serious drug-related select AE of diarrhea (Table 34). The 
incidence of diarrhoea/colitis requiring immune modulating medication (IMAEs) was 5.3% (Table 40). 
Hypothyroidism 
In CA2099ER, all-causality AEs in the PT ‘hypothyroidism’ with nivo+cabo were reported more frequently 
with nivo+cabo (34.1% any grade; 0.3% Grade 3-4) compared with sunitinib (29.4% any grade; 0.3% 
Grade 3-4; Table 27). In comparison, in the nivolumab monotherapy trials CA209205 and CA209669 and 
the cabozantinib monotherapy trials METEOR and CABOSUN, all-causality AEs of hypothyroidism occurred 
with a frequency of 6.9%, 17.1%, 21% and 23%, respectively; grade 3-4: 0.2%, 0%, 0% and 0%, 
respectively. 
Almost all causality AEs of hypothyroidism with nivo+cabo were considered drug-related (33.4%) by the 
investigator (Table 29). When reported as on-treatment thyroid function laboratory abnormalities (see 
below), 63.4% of subjects had normal baseline but elevated post-baseline TSH levels with nivo+cabo, 
and 30.6% of subjects had elevated TSH as well as at least one FT3/FT4 < LLN, consistent with 
hypothyroidism (Table 52). 
Very few (0.3%) events of hypothyroidism in the nivo+cabo arm led to discontinuation of treatment. One 
subject (0.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm had a serious drug-related AE of hypothyroidism (data not shown). 
Hypothyroidism/thyroiditis is within the category of endocrine IMAEs, which do not have a requirement of 
immune modulating medication, and the incidence was 25.3% (grade 3-4 0.6%) in the nivo+cabo arm 
(Table 40). 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 106/131 
 
 
 
 
 
Rash 
In CA2099ER, all-causality any grade AEs in the PT ‘rash’ (21.6% any grade; 1.9% Grade 3-4) were 
mainly Grade 1-2 in severity with nivo+cabo (Table 27). In comparison, in the nivolumab monotherapy 
trials CA209205 and CA209669 and the cabozantinib monotherapy trials METEOR and CABOSUN, all-
causality AEs of rash occurred with a frequency of 15.8%, 32.5%, 15%, 15%, respectively; grade 3-4: 
0.7%, 3.3%, 0.6%, 0%, respectively. 
In CA2099ER, most all causality AEs of rash with nivo+cabo were considered drug-related (19.4%) by the 
investigator. One subject (0.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm had a serious drug-related AE of rash. The 
incidence of IMAEs of rash in the nivo+cabo arm (10.0%) indicates the requirement of immune 
modulating medication for rash in CA2099ER. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Delay/Interruption or Reduction 
AEs leading to dose delays or reductions 
The numbers and percentages of patients with any-Grade all-causality AEs leading to dose delays or 
reductions as of the 30-Mar-2020 DBL were as follows:

only 
−  Both nivolumab and cabozantinib: 68 patients (21.3%) with AEs leading to delays or reductions of 
both nivolumab and cabozantinib due to the same AE at the same time  
−  Sequential: 20 patients (6.3%) with AEs leading to sequential delays or reductions of nivolumab 
and cabozantinib  
−  Unassigned: 21 patients (6.6%) were unassigned to any of the above categories due to lack of 
information on the study drug exposure CRF page

Brief narratives of the 5 subjects in the nivo+cabo arm who had concurrent ALT or AST > 3X ULN with 
TBili > 2X ULN are provided below : 
•  Subject CA2099ER-45-740 was a 73 year old male who experienced Grade 3 hepatotoxicity 
(related) on Day 50; his lab test results showed elevated liver function tests (LFTs) wit 
ALT/AST > 3X ULN and TBili > 2X ULN (ALT of 611 U/L, AST of 466 U/L, and TBili of 47 
umol/L). Treatment with corticosteroids was given, and both study drugs were delayed. By 
Day 64, the hepatotoxicity improved to Grade 2, and cabozantinib and nivolumab were 
restarted. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity recurred on Day 78; steroid therapy was given, and both 
study drugs were delayed again. By Day 92, hepatotoxicity improved to Grade 1, and 
cabozantinib and nivolumab were restarted on Day 93. The event of hepatotoxicity resolved 
(with improved levels of ALT [59 U/L], AST [28 U/L] and TBili [29 umol/L]) by Day 113. 
•  Subject CA2099ER-50-194 was a 69-year-old female who developed Grade 3 increased ALT 
(related; lab ALT of 186 U/L) on Day 28. The subject received treatment with corticosteroids, 
and both study drugs were delayed. On Day 35, lab test results showed elevated LFTs with 
ALT/AST > 3X ULN and TBili > 2X ULN (ALT of 166 U/L, AST of 71 U/L and Tbili of 41 
umol/L), and Grade 2 increased in blood bilirubin (related). The events of increased ALT and 
increased blood bilirubin resolved on Day 49, and cabozantinib and nivolumab were restarted 
on Day 58. On Days 146, 188, and 196, lab test results showed elevated LFTs with ALT/AST 
> 3X ULN and TBili > 2X ULN. The subject had malignant neoplasm progression on Day 206 
and the study therapies were discontinued.

•  Subject CA2099ER-54-170 was a 60 year old male whose lab test results showed elevated 
LFTs with ALT/AST > 3X ULN and TBili > 2X ULN (ALT of 415 U/L, AST of 384 U/L, TBili of 48 
umol/L) on Day 44, and was hospitalized on Day 46 due to Grade 4 hepatotoxicity (related). 
The lab test results on Day 46 showed elevated LFTs with ALT/AST > 3X ULN and TBili > 2X 
ULN (ALT of 463 U/L, AST of 329 U/L, and TBili of 7.4 mg/dL). The subject received treatment 
with corticosteroids; the study therapy with cabozantinib was discontinued, and nivolumab 
was delayed. Hepatotoxicity resolved on Day 52, and nivolumab restarted on Day 71. Subject 
developed Grade 3 renal failure (related) on Day 151; the event improved to Grade 2 with 
steroid treatment. On Day 204, study therapy with nivolumab was discontinued due to 
worsening of hepatotoxicity. 
•  Subject CA2099ER-70-798 was a 54-year-old male whose lab test results showed ALT of 98 
U/L, AST of 88 U/L, and TBili of 14 umol/L on Day 43, and was hospitalized on Day 57 due to 
Grade 3 hepatotoxicity (related). Study drugs were discontinued, and the subject received 
treatment with steroids, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and cholecalciferol. Imaging did not 
show biliary obstruction, and he was discharged as steroid treatment had reduced the 
toxicity. The subject was re-hospitalized as his liver function tests increased again on Day 63. 
The subject was treated with corticosteroids and mycophenolate, and the event resolved on 
Day 83. The subject lab test results showed elevated LFTs with ALT/AST > 3X ULN and TBili > 
2X ULN (ALT of 152 U/L, AST of 61 U/L, TBili of 62 umol/l) on Day 148; the event did not 
resolve. The subject had progression of disease on Day 189. 
•  Subject CA2099ER-106-940 was a 52-year-old male who had Grade 2 blood bilirubin 
increased (related; lab TBili of 34 umol/L) at Day 155. Treatment with steroids was given, 
and both study drugs were delayed; the event resolved on Day 164. On Day 167, the subject 
developed Grade 2 AST increased (lab AST of 330 U/L). On Day 169, the subject was 
diagnosed with Grade 2 events of ALT increased and blood bilirubin increased (both related); 
the lab test results showed elevated LFTs with ALT/AST > 3X ULN and TBili > 2X ULN (ALT of 
424 U/L, AST of 411 U/L, and TBili of 39 umol/L). Both study drugs were discontinued per 
protocol. The events of increased ALT, increased AST, and increased blood bilirubin resolved 
on Day 183.

Haematology 
Haematologic abnormalities were mostly grade 1-2.  The only Grade 3-4 haematologic abnormality 
reported in ≥5% of subjects in the nivo+cabo arm was decreased absolute lymphocytes (6.9% Grade 3). 
In the sunitinib arm, the following Grade 3-4 haematologic abnormality were reported in ≥5% of subjects: 
decreased absolute neutrophil count (10.3% Grade 3), decreased absolute lymphocytes (10.0% Grade 
3), decreased platelet count (7.4% Grade 3), and decreased leukocytes (5.1% Grade 3). On-treatment 
worsening of haematology parameters to grade 3-4 relative to baseline was reported more frequently 
with sunitinib compared to nivo+cabo. 
Kidney Function Tests 
In the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, overall 31.5% of subjects with at least 1 on-treatment 
measurement had normal (Grade 0) creatinine values during the treatment reporting period. 
In both treatment arms, the majority of reported abnormalities in creatinine (increased) were Grade 1 or 
2: 50.8% were Grade 1, 16.7% were Grade 2. 4 (1.3%) subjects in the nivo+cabo arm and 2 (0.6%) 
subjects in the sunitinib arm had a Grade 3-4 increased creatinine level.

ECG abnormalities 
ECG abnormalities at baseline and on-treatment are shown in below table. The treatment emergent 
abnormalities with potential clinical significance under ‘Other’ were summarized in the following 
categories: 1) QT prolongation in 6 subjects with nivo + cabo and 3 with sunitinib; 2) Infarct/MI in 4 
subjects with nivo+cabo and 4 with sunitinib; 3) LAFB/LBBB/BIFASCICULAR in 7 subjects with nivo+cabo 
and 5 with sunitinib.

Safety in special populations 
Overall, as of the 30-Mar-2020 DBL the safety profile of nivo+cabo among subgroups of race and 
geographic region was generally similar to the total nivo+cabo treated population. However, very low 
numbers of non-whites participated in the pivotal trial, so results are not interpretable with respect to 
race. 
The following numerical differences were observed in the subgroups of gender within the Endocrine 
Disorder SOC: female patients reported more all-causality any Grade AEs than male patients for both 
treatment arms (nivo+cabo: 36.8% for males and 50.7% for females; sunitinib: 28.2% for males and 
38.7% for females). Drug-related AEs also showed a higher incidence for female patients in Endocrine 
Disorders SOC. 
With regard to age, more SAEs were observed in older subjects (≥65, ≥65 and <75, and 75 years) 
compared with younger subjects (< 65 years) in both treatment arms. In the nivo+cabo treatment arm, 
frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation were higher in the 75-84 and ≥ 85 years age group 
compared with the < 65 years and 65-74 years age group; this difference was not seen in the sunitinib 
treatment arm. However, the interpretation is limited by small number of subjects in the 75 to 84 years 
of age (n = 27 in the nivo+cabo arm and n = 25 in the sunitinib arm) and ≥ 85 years of age (n = 2 in the 
nivo+cabo arm and n = 4 in the sunitinib arm) subgroups.

Subgroup analyses comparing favourable risk patients with of patients with intermediate/poor risk were 
reported. These data indicate that there are no large differences in all-causality (Any Grade, Grade 3-4) 
AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation between subjects with favourable risk versus the subgroup 
of subject with intermediate/poor risk for the nivo+cabo arm. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Multiple drug interaction studies have been conducted with cabozantinib, the results of which are 
reflected in the current product SmPC. No new information has been generated in support of this 
submission. However, pharmacokinetic analysis to evaluate whether nivolumab may influence the PK of 
cabozantinib has been performed (please refer to section 2.3.2). 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with nivolumab. No new 
information has been generated in support of this submission.

Post marketing experience 
Cabozantinib was first approved on 25-Apr-2016 in the US for the treatment of patients with advanced 
RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy, and on 09-09-2016 in the EU for the treatment of 
adults with advanced RCC who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted 
therapy. Since then, cabozantinib has been approved for use in previously untreated patients with RCC 
and patients with HCC who have received prior sorafenib. 
According to the MAH, based on worldwide pharmacovigilance activities, review of postmarketing safety 
data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety data for cabozantinib.  
Nivolumab was first approved on 04-Jul-2014 in Japan for unresectable melanoma and has since been 
approved in multiple countries, including the US and in the EU, and for other indications as monotherapy. 
Based on pharmacovigilance activities, review of post-marketing safety data is consistent with, and 
confirms the clinical trial safety data for nivolumab. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile for nivolumab (240 mg IV Q2W) and cabozantinib (40 mg PO QD) combination therapy 
has not been described previously. The safety data in support of the sought indication extension for 
cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab  (nivo+cabo) for first line treatment of adults with advanced 
RCC, is based on the pivotal CA2099ER study, which is an ongoing, phase 3, randomized, open-label, 
multicenter study vs. sunitinib (database lock date 30 March 2020, updated safety database lock date 10 
September 2020).  The contribution of each drug to the safety profile of the combination nivo+cabo was 
derived from cross-study comparisons of trials with the monocomponents in advanced RCC indications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021

Some important differences to note between the monotherapy studies and the pivotal study CA2099ER 
include different doses of cabozantinib (60 mg in the monotherapy studies vs. 40 mg in CA2099ER), 
differences in study populations (lines of therapy, prognosis risk groups included), as well as differences 
in the methods used to capture and report safety events. Although recognizing the caveats of cross-trial 
comparisons, it is considered that the contextualization of the nivo+cabo safety profile with the 
monotherapies is of value, as it gives a broad impression of the contribution of each drug to the safety 
profile of the combination. It should also be noted that the pivotal CA2099ER study was performed open-
label, which is a potential source of bias. 
Median follow-up was 15.70 months for the nivo+cabo arm and 14.59 months for the sunitinib arm at 30-
Mar-2020 DBL. Overall median duration of therapy was longer in the nivo+cabo arm (14.26 months) 
compared to the sunitinib arm (9.23 months). In relation to the proposed target population the extent of 
exposure in the nivo+cabo arm is considered acceptable for the assessment of the B/R.  The long-term 
safety of the combination of nivo+cabo is not known, however this is considered acceptable considering 
the prognoses of these patients and the fact that many patients will receive subsequent therapies. The 
median number of cabozantinib doses received was 352.5, corresponding to approximately 12 months of 
treatment regardless of dose delays. At the time of database lock (30-Mar-2020), median time on 
treatment for the combination arm was not reached (55.6% of the patients still on treatment). It is likely 
that the longer time on treatment seen with nivo+cabo is reflective of the improved efficacy over the 
control arm, as most patients who discontinued treatment did so due to disease progression (27.8% in 
the nivo+cabo arm vs 48.1% in the sunitinib arm). Overall, 29.4% of patients discontinued the study 
(24.4% in the nivo+cabo treatment arm, 34.4% in the sunitinib arm). The most common reason for 
discontinuation was death: 22.8% of subjects (19.4% in the nivo+cabo arm and 26.3% in the sunitinib 
arm). 
The MAH submitted updated safety data with a 10-Sep-2020 DBL indicating comparable safety data to 
the March 2020 DBL. Nevertheless, the following were noted: a longer exposure in the nivo+cabo arm, a 
higher proportion of subjects requiring at least one dose delay of cabozantinib (81.9% vs 68.11%) and 
sunitinib (72.8% vs 51.9%), more deaths due to disease progression in both arms and more 
discontinuations due to AEs in both arms (for nivo+cabo 31.6% vs 19.7%; for sunitinib 16.9% vs 
19.4%), all of which were to be expected and are considered acceptable. 
No study report has been submitted to support dose selection in the CA2099ER study, which was based 
on safety data from an investigator-initiated phase I dose escalation study (see Section 2.4.1). The dose 
finding study concluded on the 40 mg cabozantinib dose over the 60 mg dose, based on a trend towards 
less treatment related AEs and fewer dose reductions in the 40 mg dose groups (n=12) compared to the 
60 mg dose groups (n=12). Lower doses of cabozantinib were not investigated, and there is a potential 
for ameliorated tolerability at even lower initial dose levels, which is also supported by previous 
cabozantinib exposure-safety modelling in RCC monotherapy (see section 2.3.5).  It is possible, but 
remains unknown, that efficacy could be maintained at a lower cabozantinib starting dose. The MAH is 
recommended to prospectively investigate lower dose levels for cabozantinib in future studies. 
In CA2099ER, dose delay (delays and interruptions) criteria for the management of AEs during 
nivolumab, cabozantinib, or sunitinib treatment were established. Dosing of nivolumab could be delayed 
without concomitant delay of cabozantinib dosing if toxicity was assessed to be related to only nivolumab, 
and vice versa. As a main rule, dosing was to be resumed at a lower dose when re-treatment criteria 
were met (cabozantinib and sunitinib only). Dose delays or dose reductions (all causes) were more 
common in the nivo+cabo treatment arm (83.4% overall) compared to the sunitinib treatment arm 
(51.9% in addition to the planned 2 weeks off treatment). A total of 71.9% of subjects had dose delays 
for nivolumab only, while 68.1% of patients had dose delays for cabozantinib only. Any-grade all-
causality AEs leading to dose delays occurred in 78.8% of the patients in the nivo+cabo arm, versus 
65.3% patients in the sunitinib arm. No dose reductions were allowed for nivolumab. Dose reductions of

cabozantinib (all reasons) occurred in 56.3% of patients. Dose reductions of cabozantinib due to an AE 
occurred in 50.6% of patients. Median daily dose cabozantinib was 29.55 mg, which is about 10 mg lower 
than the planned dose of 40 mg. In comparison, the median daily dose of sunitinib was 28.42 mg, or 
about 5 mg lower than the planned dose of 33.33 mg/day (50 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by no 
treatment for 2 weeks). Relative dose intensity for cabozantinib was low; 48% of patients had less than 
70% relative dose intensity, and 17% of patients had lower than 50% relative dose intensity. The high 
frequency of dose modifications indicates poor tolerability of the nivo+cabo combination, which is handled 
by dose reductions (for cabozantinib) and delays of one or both medicinal products. Recommendations for 
dose reductions in the cabozantinib SmPC (“reduce the dose to 20 mg of CABOMETYX once daily, and 
then to 20 mg every other day”) are based on the CA2099ER study and are considered acceptable.   
Almost all patients in both treatment arms experienced adverse events (AEs) in the pivotal study 
(99.7% in the nivo+cabo arm and 99.1% in the sunitinib arm). When incidence rates were exposure-
adjusted, all-causality AE incidence rates (events per 100 person-years) were 1705.2 in the nivo+cabo 
treatment arm and 1852.6 in the sunitinib arm. The most frequently reported any grade, all causality 
AEs (≥30%) in the nivo+cabo arm and/or the sunitinib arm were diarrhoea (63.8% vs 47.2%), PPES 
(40.0% vs 40.6%), hypertension (34.7% vs 37.2%), hypothyroidism (34.1% vs 29.4%) fatigue (32.2% 
vs 34.7%) and nausea (26.6% vs 30.6%, respectively). All causality grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported with 
higher frequency in the nivo+cabo treatment arm (70.3%) compared to the sunitinib arm (65.3%). The 
most frequently reported Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs (≥ 5%) in the nivo+cabo arm and/or the sunitinib 
arm were hypertension (12.5% vs 13.1%), hyponatraemia (9.4% vs 5.9%), PPES (7.5% in both 
treatment arms), diarrhea (6.9% vs 4.4%), lipase increased (6.3% vs 4.7%), hypophosphatemia (5.9% 
vs 1.3%) , ALT increased (5.3% vs 2.2%) and neutrophil count decreased (0.3% vs 5.0%). 
The large majority of subjects had at least one drug-related AE reported: 96.6% of patients in the 
nivo+cabo arm, and 93.1% in the sunitinib arm; the most common (≥25% in either treatment arm) being 
diarrhoea (56.9% vs 42.5%), PPES (38.1% vs 40.3%), hypothyroidism (33.4% vs 28.1%), hypertension 
(30.3% vs 33.4%), fatigue (26.9% vs 30.3%), ALT increased (25.0% vs 6.0%), and nausea (21.3% vs 
23.3%). Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 60.6% of patients in the nivo+cabo arm, and 
50.6% in the sunitinib arm. The most frequently reported grade 3-4 drug-related AEs (≥5% in the 
nivo+cabo treatment arm) were hypertension (10.9% vs 12.2%), PPES (7.5% in both arms), 
hyponatraemia (6.9% vs 4.4%), diarrhoea (5.6% vs 4.4%), lipase increased (5.3% vs 4.7%), 
hypophosphataemia (5.3% vs 4.7%).  In general, frequencies of drug-related AEs with the nivo+cabo 
combination were comparable to frequencies previously reported for the drugs used in monotherapy. 
Drug-related adverse events within the SOCs GI disorders, Endocrine disorders, Skin and Subcutaneous 
disorders, and Hepatobiliary disordes, were more frequently reported for nivo+cabo  compared to 
sunitinib. Events within these SOCs show potential additive toxicity with nivo+cabo (hepatotoxicity, 
diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, rash), and were therefore further assessed. Haematological toxicity was less 
frequently observed with nivo+cabo treatment compared to sunitinib. 
No new terms were identified for nivo+cabo that have not been seen previously with either cabozantinib 
or nivolumab monotherapy. The method for considering which ADRs to include in the tabulated list of 
Section 4.8 of the Cabometyx SmPC was based on clinical relevance as determined by the sponsor’s 
medical reviewer. For non-included events assessed as related by the investigator, the MAH has provided 
rationales for evaluation which is considered acceptable.  
Treatment-related SAEs were more frequently reported in the nivo+cabo arm (24.4% vs 12.8%). The 
most frequently reported drug-related SAEs in (≥ 1% of subjects in the nivo+cabo  arm) were diarrhoea 
(3.4% in the nivo+cabo arm vs 0% in the sunitinib arm), pneumonitis (2.8% vs 0%), pulmonary 
embolism (1.9% vs 0.3%), adrenal insufficiency (1.9% vs 0%), and hyponatraemia (1.3% vs 0.9%).

Overall, as of DCO (Mar-2020), more patients had died in the sunitinib arm (99; 30.9%) compared to the 
nivo+cabo arm (67; 20.9%). Most deaths were due to disease (51[23.1%] patients in the sunitinib arm, 
74 patients [15.9%] in the nivo+cabo arm arm, respectively). The frequency of death from drug toxicity 
was low in both treatment arms. There was one death in the nivo+cabo treatment arm attributed to 
study drug toxicity vs. two deaths in the sunitinib arm. The treatment-related fatal event in the 
nivo+cabo arm was due to small intestine perforation, which is a known ADR for cabozantinib. Deaths 
attributed to other reasons were reported in 12 (3.8%) of subjects in the nivo+cabo arm and 17 (5.3%) 
of subjects in the sunitinib arm. For three of these deaths attributed to other reasons (a patient who died 
from a GI bleeding and two from intestinal perforation) a causal role of study therapy cannot be excluded 
or ascertained due to limited available information. A warning/precautionary statement in section 4.4 of 
the current Cabometyx SmPC is included for serious GI perforations and fistulas (including fatal cases), 
which is considered adequate. . 
Analyses of Select AEs, Immune-related AEs (IMAEs) and Other events of special interest (OESI) were 
conducted in order to further characterize AEs of special clinical interest (potentially) associated with the 
use of nivolumab. All grade and grade 3-4 Select AEs (except grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions), 
IMAEs and OESIs categories occurred more frequently with nivo+cabo compared to sunitinib.  
The total number patients with select AEs was 164 (57.5%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 136 (42.5%) in 
the sunitinib arm (data not shown). The majority of Select AEs were Grade 1-2 and most were considered 
drug-related by the investigator. The most commonly occurring grade 3-4 drug-related Select AE 
category was skin and hepatic, which occurred in 10.6% and 10.3% of patients in the nivo+cabo 
treatment arm, respectively, compared to 7.5% and 3.4% in the sunitinib arm, respectively. Immune-
related management algorithms were included in the protocol for CA2099ER. These guidelines included 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids for immuno-oncology related adverse events. The proportion of 
patients with drug-related Select AEs who were treated with immune-modulating medication (mainly 
corticosteroids) ranged from 10.9% for endocrine and gastrointestinal Select AEs to 52.9% for pulmonary 
Select AEs. Most drug-related non-endocrine select AEs (GI, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin, and 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions) with nivo+cabo treatment had resolved (ranging from 65.8% to 100% 
across non-endocrine select AE categories) at the time of DBL. In total, 34.3% of the drug-related 
endocrine select AEs with nivo+cabo were resolved, with the median time to resolution of not evaluable. 
Some drug-related endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for 
hormone replacement therapy.  
The majority of IMAEs were grade 1-2. The most frequently reported grade 3-4 IMAE in the nivo+cabo 
treatment arm was hepatitis (5.9%). Almost all (96.9%) patients with an IMAE of hepatitis resolved, with 
median time to resolution 4.1 weeks. The majority, 10/17 (58.8%) of patients who had a rechallenge 
after resolution of IMAE hepatitis, experienced recurrence after reinitiation. Non-endocrine IMAEs 
occurred infrequently in the sunitinib arm. 
Overall, a higher proportion of patients in the nivo+cabo treatment arm experienced OESI compared to 
the sunitinib treatment (8/320; 2.5% vs. 1/320; 0.3%, respectively). 14 OESI events were experienced 
in the nivo+cabo treatment arm; all these were assessed as related to study drug. In the nivo+cabo arm, 
the OESIs reported were myasthenic syndrome (1 subject [2 events]), Guillain Barré syndrome (1 subject 
[1 event]), pancreatitis (2 subjects [1 event each]), uveitis (1 subject [3 events]), encephalitis (2 
subjects [1 event each]), and myocarditis (1 subject [4 events]). Over half of these events (8/14) were 
grade 3-4 and five were SAEs. Three events are ongoing at the 30 March 2020 DCO date, these are two 
unresolved/ongoing events of acute pancreatitis/pancreatitis and one event of myocarditis. Pancreatitis is 
also an uncommonly reported ADR in cabozantinib monotherapy trials. 
There were no OESI events in the categories of myositis, demyelination, rhabdomyolysis, and graft 
versus host disease.

Overall, any grade Events To Monitor (ETM) for cabozantinib occurred with a somewhat higher 
frequency in the nivo+cabo treatment arm (78%, grade 3-4: 34.4%) compared to the sunitinib treatment 
arm (72.8%, grade 3-4: 29.4%). However, considering the differences in time exposure between the 
treatment arms, the observed differences are of uncertain relevance. The most frequently reported (≥
20%) all-causality ETMs were PPES, hypertension and haemorrhage, all of which were reported with 
similar frequencies in both treatment arms (40.0%, 35.9% and 21.3% respectively in the nivo+cabo arm, 
and 40.6%, 39.1% and 20.9% respectively in the sunitinib arm). The most frequently reported grade 3-
4 ETMs in the nivo+cabo arm were hypertension (13.8%), PPES (7.5%) and venous and mixed 
thrombotic events (7.2%). Of these grade 3-4 ETMs, venous and mixed thrombotic events were the only 
events less commonly reported in the sunitinib treatment arm (2.5%). Most of the PTs in the ETM of 
venous and mixed thrombotic events were pulmonary embolism (20/36 events, of which grade 3-4: 
17/20). There were five events of severity grade 4 in this ETM category. These events were reported as 
generally successfully treated with low molecular weight heparins, and had a short time (within 10 days) 
to event resolution. Pulmonary embolism is a commonly occurring event with cabozantinib, and is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Similar rates of grade 5 ETMs were reported in both treatment arm. There were five (1.6%) grade 5 ETMs 
in the nivo+cabo arm, all assessed as unrelated to study drug. The grade 5 ETMs in the nivo+cabo arm 
were: GI perforation, upper GI haemorrhage, sudden death, cardiorespiratory arrest, cardiac arrest.  
The ETM of hepatotoxicity includes the SMQs “Drug related hepatic disorders- severe events only”. 
Transaminase elevations, commonly observed during cabozantinib treatment, are apparently not included 
in the hepatotoxicity ETM. Hepatotoxicity ETM of all grades and grade 3-4 was reported more frequently 
in the nivo+cabo treatment arm (9.1% and 4.4%, respectively) compared to the sunitinib arm (4.7% and 
1.3%, respectively). Under the hepatotoxicity ETM, the PTs reported for ≥2 subjects in the nivo+cabo arm 
were hepatotoxicity (all grades 5.6%, grade 3-4 2.5%) hepatitis (all grade 1.9%, grade 3-4 0.9%) and 
autoimmune hepatitis (all grades 0.6%, grade 3-4 0.6%). The PT of hepatotoxicity has not been included 
in the ADR table of Cabometyx SmPC, however it is considered sufficient to have  the term of hepatitis 
(including autoimmune hepatitis), increased ALT, increased AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, and 
increased total bilirubin in the Investigations SOC included in the SmPC.   
No new safety signals were identified with nivo+cabo, relative to the type of AEs typically observed for 
each agent in monotherapy trials. The most common all-causality AEs with nivo+cabo in CA2099ER are 
generally reflected in the commonly reported all-causality AEs for each individual agent in the previous 
RCC monotherapy studies for these drugs, but some differences were noted. ALT increased, AST 
increased (hepatotoxicity), diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, and rash appeared to occur more frequently with 
the nivo+cabo combination compared to the monotherapies, and they occurred more frequently 
compared to the sunitinb arm in CA2099ER, as well. The majority of these four types of AEs were 
considered drug-related by the investigator. The higher frequencies and/or severities of these AEs with 
nivo+cabo observed in CA2099ER compared to nivolumab and cabozantinib as monotherapies, suggests 
potentially additive effects of the two drugs when used in combination. These four toxicities were 
therefore further assessed.  
Hepatotoxicity: Laboratory abnormalities of ALT and AST increases were reported more frequently with 
nivo+cabo (78.8% and 77.3%, respectively) compared to sunitinib (39.0% and 57.1%, respectively), 
including grade 3 or 4 ALT and AST abnormalities (9.8% and 7.9% vs 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively). 
Grade ≥3 ALT and AST abnormalities with nivo+cabo were also more frequent compared to the 
nivolumab (3.2% ALT and 2.8% AST) and cabozantinib (3.3% ALT and 3.3% AST) monotherapies, 
indicating additive hepatotoxicity with nivo+cabo. Overall, characteristics of drug-related hepatic select 
AEs were congruent with those of ALT and AST elevations ≥ 3XULN in terms of time to onset, 
requirement for immune-modulating medication, outcome and time to resolution. A warning has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that when cabozantinib is given in combination with nivolumab, 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 119/131 
 
 
 
 
higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations have been reported relative to cabozantinib 
monotherapy in patients with advanced RCC. Liver enzymes should be monitored before initiation of and 
periodically throughout treatment. 
Diarrhoea: The frequencies of all-causality diarrhoea in the nivo+cabo treatment arm of CA2099ER 
(63.8% any grade; 6.9% Grade 3-4), were higher than in the nivolumab monotherapy studies CA209205 
and CA209669 (all-causality 23.6% and 30.9%; grade 3-4 1.2% and 3,3%, respectively), but lower than 
seen in the cabozantinib monotherapy studies METEOR and CABOSUN (all-causality 74% and 73%; grade 
3-4 11% and 10%, respectively), acknowledging the higher doses of cabozantinib in METEOR and 
CABOSUN vs CA2099ER (60 mg vs. 40 mg), overall suggesting potential small additive toxicity. Most 
events of diarrhoea with nivo+cabo were of low grade and manageable using standard AE management 
practices. The SmPC for Cabometyx includes a warning/precautionary statement for gastrointestinal 
disorders, including diarrhoea, which is considered sufficient. 
Hypothyroidism: TSH increases (> ULN) from baseline (≤ ULN) were reported more frequently in 
subjects in the nivo+cabo arm (201/317; 63.4%), compared to the sunitinib arm (159/306; 52.0%). The 
frequency of all causality any grade AEs of hypothyroidism noted with nivo+cabo was higher than seen in 
the monotherapy studies: 34.1% with nivo+cabo, vs 7-17% with nivolumab monotherapy and 21-23% 
with cabozantinib monotherapy, suggesting potential additive toxicity. The frequency of all causality 
Grade 3-4 AEs of hypothyroidism noted with nivo+cabo was low and similar to what is seen in the 
monotherapy studies: 0.3% with nivo+cabo vs 0-0.2% with nivolumab monotherapy and 0% with 
cabozantinib monotherapy, indicating that there may not be additive toxicity for severe events of 
hypothyroidism. Most events of hypothyroidism with nivo+cabo were manageable using standard AE 
management practices. Considering the high frequency observed in monotherapy trials with cabozantinib 
and with the combination, a warning has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC. Baseline laboratory 
measurement of thyroid function is recommended in all patients. Patients with pre-existing 
hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start 
of cabozantinib treatment. All patients should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid 
dysfunction during cabozantinib treatment. Thyroid function should be monitored periodically throughout 
treatment with cabozantinib. Patients who develop thyroid dysfunction should be treated as per standard 
medical practice. 
Rash: The frequencies of all causality any grade AEs rash noted with nivo+cabo (21.6% any grade; 1.9% 
grade 3-4), were generally higher than with the monotherapies Most rash events were of low grade and 
manageable using standard AE management practices. There was one related SAE of rash with nivo+cabo 
in CA2099ER. The SmPC Section 4.4 for Cabometyx does not contain any warning/precautionary 
statement concerning severe rash, however PPES is mentioned in Section 4.4. Considering the low grade 
of rash events for the majority of reported cases, and the general drug toxicity management guidelines 
already in place, further warning/precautionary statement for rash is not warranted at this time. 
Nivo+cabo and sunitinib have a different pattern of worsening of laboratory abnormalities relative to 
baseline. In the sunitinib arm haematology abnormalities were more frequent, while in the nivo+cabo 
arm liver function abnormalities, thyroid function abnormalities and certain electrolyte abnormalities 
(hypocalcemia, hypomagnesia, hypophosphatemia) occurred more frequently. Grade 3-4 electrolyte 
abnormalities were similar between the two study arms, except for Grade 3-4 hypophosphatemia (20.6% 
vs 6.8%) which occurred more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm. There are no large differences in the 
number of patients with ECG abnormalities on treatment in the nivo+cabo arm (40.6%) compared to the 
sunitinib arm (35%). 
Any grade all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug occurred in 19.7% of 
subjects in the nivo+cabo arm, which is higher than in the sunitinib arm (16.9%, Table 47). However, a 
lower proportion discontinued both drugs simultaneously in the nivo+cabo arm (5.6%) compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/145012/2021 
Page 120/131 
 
 
 
 
sunitinib. Cabozantinib only was discontinued in 7.5% of subjects, and nivolumab only in 6.6% of 
subjects due to AEs (data not shown). The most common all-causality AE leading to study drug 
discontinuation in the nivo+cabo arm was ALT elevation (1.9%), while in the sunitinib arm, it was 
malignant neoplasm progression (2.2%). Treatment discontinuation due to all-causality AEs in the 
nivo+cabo arm in CA2099ER was comparable to what was reported for cabozantinib in the CABOSUN 
study (21%), but higher than the METEOR study, where 10% discontinued due to AEs (refer to EPAR 
EMEA/H/C/004163/0000 and EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0003). Most AEs who led to any study drug 
discontinuation in the nivo+cabo arm were considered drug-related (15.3% of the patients discontinued 
any drug due to drug-related AE; 5.6% discontinued nivolumab only; 6.6% discontinued cabozantinib 
only; and 3.1% discontinued both), while in the sunitinib arm, a lower proportion of drug-related AEs 
(8.8%) led to discontinuation. The most commonly reported drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation 
of any drug in the nivo+cabo arm were ALT increased (1.9%), AST increased (1.6%), proteinuria (1.6%), 
adrenal insufficiency (0.9%), and pneumonitis (0.9%). In the sunitinib arm, the most commonly reported 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation was proteinuria (1.9%) and PPES (0.9%). The drug-related 
AEs leading to discontinuation in ≥2 patients with nivo+cabo, are all known ADRs with cabozantinib 
and/or nivolumab. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In the 1L treatment setting of advanced RCC patients no new safety concerns have arisen for nivolumab 
and cabozantinib combination therapy. ALT and AST increases and hypothyroidism appear to occur more 
frequently with nivo+cabo than with the monotherapies, diarrhoea was observed more frequently 
compared to nivolumab monotherapy, and rash was observed more frequently compared to cabozantinib 
monotherapy. This is likely because these are both overlapping toxicities for nivolumab and cabozantinib. 
The assessment is complicated by the lack of direct comparison in the pivotal study, and by the lower 
dose of cabozantinib (40 mg) employed with the combination compared to the cross-referenced 
monotherapy trials. 
The toxicity of treatment with nivo+cabo is slightly worse compared to treatment with sunitinib with 
slightly higher rates of severe AEs, SAEs, dose modifications and discontinuations. The most important 
differences in toxicity profile pertain to the AEs of diarrhoea, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and 
rash, that were more frequently observed in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm, while 
haematological toxicity was observed less frequently. The toxicity profile for nivo+cabo appears 
manageable with dose delays, dose reductions and, in case of immune-related AEs, immune modulating 
therapies.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
In the current variation, the addition of the proposed indication in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 
combination with nivolumab, the design, layout and format of the leaflet is not impacted. The 
modifications in the leaflet relate to slight changes in the safety profile and current writing style is 
followed. In the context of user testing, the updates are considered non-significant.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include the use of Cabometyx in combination with 
nivolumab the first-line (1L) treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The medicinal products and combinations of medicinal products that are currently approved in the EU for 
first-line (1L) systemic treatment in ccRCC are the following: pembrolizumab + axitinib, sunitinib, 
pazopanib, tivozanib, nivolumab + ipilimumab, and cabozantinib. In spite of available therapies, both 
(median) progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced RCC are 
still rather limited, especially for patients in the intermediate and poor risk groups.  
In particular, RCC with sarcomatoid features is characterised by limited therapeutic options due to its 
relative resistance to established systemic targeted therapy. Most trials report on a poor median overall 
survival of 5 to 12 months. Studies have shown that sarcomatoid RCC express programmed death 1 (PD-
1) and its ligand (PD-L1) at a much higher level than non-sarcomatoid RCC, suggesting that blockade of 
the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may be an attractive new therapeutic strategy (Pichler et al, 2019). 
Therefore, an unmet medical need remains.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The single pivotal study in this application is CA2099ER (NCT03141177), a phase 3, open-label, (1:1) 
randomized trial of nivolumab combined with cabozantinib (nivo+cabo, doublet regimen, Arm A) vs 
sunitinib (Arm C) in patients with previously untreated (1L) advanced RCC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study CA2099ER met its primary endpoint at a pre-planned final analysis for PFS. Nivo+cabo 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared with 
sunitinib: HR = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.64); p <0.0001. Median PFS was longer with nivo+cabo compared 
with sunitinib: 16.59 (95% CI: 12.45, 24.94) vs 8.31 (95% CI: 6.97, 9.69) months, respectively (an 
increase of 8.28 months) (data cutoff 30 March 2020). 
The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the pre-planned final PFS analysis, and so were 
the results of PFS per BICR using the secondary definition of PFS in accordance with EMA/CHMP guideline: 
HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.67; median PFS 14.29 (95% CI: 12.29, 19.84) vs 8.31 (95% CI: 7.00, 9.69) 
months. In a subgroup analysis, PFS HRs for almost all subgroups favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR 
<1). 
Nivo+cabo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the secondary endpoint OS compared 
with sunitinib: HR = 0.60 (98.89% CI: 0.40, 0.89); p = 0.0010. Median OS was not reached in either

treatment group. In a subgroup analysis, OS HRs for almost all subgroups favoured nivo+cabo vs 
sunitinib (HR <1). 
The secondary endpoint ORR per BICR was statistically significantly higher with nivo+cabo than with 
sunitinib: 55.7% (95% CI: 50.1, 61.2) vs 27.1% (95% CI: 22.4, 32.3); difference +28.6% (95% CI: 
21.7, 35.6); odds ratio = 3.52 (95% CI: 2.51, 4.95); p <0.0001). In the nivo+cabo arm compared with 
the sunitinib arm, a numerically higher proportion of patients had a BOR of CR (8.0% vs 4.6%) or PR 
(47.7% vs 22.6%). The median duration of response (DoR) tended to be longer with nivo+cabo than 
with sunitinib: 20.17 (95% CI: 17.31, N.A.) vs 11.47 (95% CI: 8.31, 18.43) months. The median time to 
response (TTR) per BICR for all confirmed responders was 2.83 (95% CI: 1.0, 19.4) months with 
nivo+cabo vs 4.17 (95% CI: 1.7, 12.3) months with sunitinib. In a subgroup analysis, the difference in 
unweighted ORRs favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib in all subgroups. 
An efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score 
and tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%). 
Updated results (10-Sep-2020 DBL) with approximately 5.5 months additional follow-up were 
confirmative. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Notwithstanding the statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR observed (data cutoff 30 
March 2020) for nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib that were confirmed by the updated results, efficacy 
data in terms of OS remains overall somewhat immature. In the updated results the death rate in the 
nivo+cabo arm was 26.6% vs 35.4% in the sunitinib arm, with median OS only reached in the sunitinib 
arm (29.47 [28.35, NA] months). Therefore, some uncertainty remains regarding an OS benefit 
particularly in the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Similar frequencies of any-Grade all-causality AEs were reported in the nivo+cabo arm (99.7%) and in 
the sunitinib arm (99.1%). The overall incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs (respectively 70.3% vs 65.3%), SAEs 
(46.3% vs 39.7%) and treatment-related SAEs (24.4% vs 12.8%) was higher in the nivo+cabo vs the 
sunitinib arm. 
The most frequently reported any-Grade all-causality AEs in the nivo+cabo arm were diarrhoea 
(63.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES; 40.0%), hypertension (34.7%), 
hypothyroidism (34.1%), fatigue (32.2%), ALT increased (28.1%), decreased appetite (28.1%), nausea 
(26.6%) and AST increased (25.3%). Most of these AEs were considered to be treatment-related in the 
nivo+cabo arm.  
Of the any-Grade all-causality AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients, diarrhoea (63.8% vs 47.2%), increased 
ALT (28.1% vs 8.4%), increased AST (25.3% vs 10.9%) and rash (21.6% vs 8.1%) were observed much 
more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm.  
Increases in ALT and AST (except in CABOSUN where these were solicited) and hypothyroidism were 
observed more frequently with nivo+cabo treatment compared to both nivolumab (study CA209205 and 
CA209669) and cabozantinib monotherapy (METEOR and CABOSUN studies). Frequencies of diarrhoea 
noted with nivo+cabo were higher compared to nivolumab monotherapy, but lower compared to 
cabozantinib monotherapy. Frequencies of rash reported with nivo+cabo were higher compared to 
cabozantinib monotherapy, but lower compared to nivolumab monotherapy.

EMA/145012/2021

The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs in the nivo+cabo arm were hypertension 
(12.5%), hyponatraemia (9.4%), PPES (7.5%), diarrhoea (6.9%), lipase increased (6.3%). There was no 
large difference in frequencies of Grade 3-4 AEs between the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arm. 
The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs in the nivo+cabo arm were diarrhoea (4.7%), malignant 
neoplasm progression (4.1%), pneumonitis (2.8%), pulmonary embolism (2.8%), pneumonia (2.2%) and 
hyponatraemia (2.2%). There were no large differences in frequencies of SAEs between the two study 
arms, except for diarrhoea (4.7% in the nivo+cabo arm vs 0% in the sunitinib arm). 
In the nivo+cabo arm a single (0.3%) death due to small intestine perforation was considered related to 
treatment by the investigator, in the sunitinib arm two (0.6%) deaths due to respiratory distress and 
pneumonia/acute respiratory failure were considered related to treatment.  
Discontinuation of (any) study medication due to AEs occurred at a slightly higher rate in the nivo+cabo 
arm (19.7%: 6.6% nivolumab only; 7.5% cabozantinib only; 5.6% both medicinal products [at the same 
time, for the same AE]) compared to the sunitinib arm (16.9%). In the nivo+cabo arm ALT increased 
(1.9%), AST increased (1.6%) and proteinuria (1.6%) were the most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation. 
AEs with potential immune-related aetiology occurred more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm vs the 
sunitinib arm. The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs in the nivo+cabo arm (vs the 
sunitinib arm) were in the categories skin (62.2% vs 47.2%), gastrointestinal (57.5% vs 42.5%), 
endocrine (42.8% vs 33.1%), and hepatic (40.0% vs 21.9%). The majority of these AEs were low Grade 
and most AEs resolved with dose delays and/or immune modulating medication. An exception was 
endocrine select AEs, in this category most AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need 
for hormone replacement therapy. 
AEs potentially associated with TKIs or VEGF inhibition (“event to monitor” [ETMs]) were observed at 
comparable rates in the nivo+cabo arm (78.1%) vs the sunitinib arm (72.8%). Grade 3 or higher ETM 
rates for nivo+cabo which were higher than in the sunitinib treatment arm were venous and mixed 
thrombotic events (7.2% vs 2.5%, respectively) and hepatotoxicity (4.4% vs 1.3%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Median follow-up was 15.70 months for the nivo+cabo arm and 14.59 months for the sunitinib arm. 
Follow-up was relatively short in relation to establishing the long-term safety of the combination of 
nivo+cabo, even with the new safety DBL of 10 September 2020. 
It cannot be excluded that the open-label design of the pivotal study may have affected safety reporting. 
The contribution of each drug to the safety profile of the combination nivo+cabo was derived from cross-
study comparisons of trials with the monocomponents in advanced RCC indications. Some important 
differences to these studies include different doses of cabozantinib (60 mg in the monotherapy studies vs. 
40 mg in CA2099ER), differences in study populations and different methods to capture and report safety 
events. 
Longer duration of therapy in the nivo+cabo treatment arm (14.26 months) compared to sunitinib (9.23 
months) could result in over-estimation of the magnitude of worse grade 3-4 event and SAE profile seen 
in the nivo+cabo arm relative to sunitinib.  
Few older subject ≥ 75 years participated in the pivotal trial, precluding any interpretation of possible 
differences in the safety profile between patients ≥ 75 years.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the single pivotal study CA2099ER, the nivo+cabo combination demonstrated a clinically relevant and 
statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared with sunitinib 
treatment. This result was robust as the results of all sensitivity analyses and of the PFS analysis using 
the secondary definition were consistent with the primary analysis. Nivo+cabo also demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in the secondary endpoints OS and ORR (per BICR) compared with 
sunitinib. An efficacy benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression status. 
Updated results were confirmative, but remain somewhat immature regarding OS. There thus remains 
some uncertainty regarding an OS benefit, particularly in the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients. 
This is, however, acceptable as there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS in any subgroup, including 
the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients that has clearly favourable PFS results with support from 
ORR.

Regarding the contribution of the individual components, the additive efficacy of both individual 
components has been shown in a qualitative sense based primarily on an increase in ORR over the 
individual agents. 
This is to be weighed against the toxicity profile for nivo+cabo which is only slightly worse compared to 
sunitinib, reflected by only slightly higher percentages of Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and dose modifications in 
the nivo+cabo arm. The most important differences in toxicity profile pertain to the AEs of diarrhoea, 
elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and rash that were more frequently observed in the nivo+cabo 
arm compared to the sunitinib arm, while haematological toxicity was observed less frequently. 
No new safety concerns were raised for nivolumab or cabozantinib, though increases in ALT and AST, and 
hypothyroidism appear to occur more frequently with nivo+cabo combination therapy compared to the 
monotherapy components separately. With nivo+cabo treatment diarrhoea was observed more frequently 
compared to nivolumab monotherapy, and rash was observed more frequently compared to cabozantinib 
monotherapy. The toxicity profile for nivo+cabo appears manageable with dose delays, dose reductions 
and, in case of immune-related AEs, immune modulating therapies. 
The high frequency of dose modifications indicates poor tolerability of the combination therapy. The 
tolerability profile and benefit/risk balance may be improved with lower initial cabozantinib doses. 
However, as lower doses have not been prospectively tested, and the dose-response relationship is not 
characterised, it is unknown whether lower initial doses would maintain similar clinical benefit. The MAH is 
recommended to explore lower doses in future studies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The nivo+cabo combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in efficacy (PFS, OS, and 
ORR) compared with sunitinib treatment. This combination of an efficacy benefit across all three 
endpoints (PFS, OS, and ORR) is regarded as being clinically relevant. Even though an OS benefit is not 
yet established for all subgroups, this is acceptable since there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS in 
any subgroup. Treatment with nivo+cabo resulted in a slightly worse toxicity profile compared to 
sunitinib. No new safety concerns have arisen for the nivo+cabo combination and the toxicity profile for 
nivo+cabo appears manageable. It can be concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC 
in adults is positive.

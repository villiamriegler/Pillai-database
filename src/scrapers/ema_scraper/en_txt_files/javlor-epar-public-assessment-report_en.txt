SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
3.1 
Introduction 
Transitional cell carcinoma urothelium (TCCU) 
TCCU  comprises  of  bladder  cancer  (90%),  renal  pelvis  (9%)  and  ureteral  carcinoma  (1%).  Radical 
cystectomy  is  the  recommended  treatment  in  most  cases  of  infiltrating,  non-metastatic  bladder 
carcinoma. External beam irradiation, with elective salvage cystectomy for residual local recurrence is 
preferred in some centres. Despite standard treatment, up to 30-40% of patients will develop distant 
metastases and approximately 15% of patients will be found to have regional or distant metastasis at 
diagnosis. Metastatic TCCU represents an aggressive disease that is associated with a median survival 
that rarely exceeds 3 - 6 months if left untreated. 
Transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium is considered to be a chemosensitive tumour. However, 
chemotherapy  confers  only  a  modest  survival  benefit  and  metastatic  disease  remains  essentially 
incurable,  with  only  a  small  number  of  patients  achieving  long-term  disease  control.  Both 
Performance Status (PS) and visceral involvement are prognostic factors predictive of overall survival 
after 1st line treatment of patients with metastatic TCCU. A number of chemotherapeutic agents have 
single  agent  activity  against  urothelial  cancer,  achieving  mainly  partial  responses  of  short  duration. 
Combination  therapy  may  yield  response  rates  of  30-35%.  M-VAC  (methotrexate  +  vinblastine  + 
doxorubicin  +  cisplatin  combination)  or  GC  (gemcitabine  +  cisplatin)  are  regimens  for  metastatic 
TCCU.  
There is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, whose disease 
has  progressed  after  or  during  a  prior  platinum-containing  regimen.  These  patients  have  a  median 
survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis. No randomised studies have been conducted 
in  this  patient  group  for  single  agent  treatment  of  second  line  TCCU.  Phase  II  studies  have  been 
conducted  in  small  populations  of  patients  (<  60)  that  show  response  rates  ranging  from  0%  with 
bortezomib to 29% with gemcitabine.  
The Medicinal Product 
Javlor  25 mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  belongs  to  the  pharmacotherapeutic  group  of 
Vinca  alkaloids  and  analogues,  ATC  code:  L01CA05.  1 ml  of  concentrate  contains  25 mg  of 
vinflunine (as ditartrate). Vinflunine (Javlor) is a microtubule inhibitor. Microtubules are involved in 
the maintenance of cell shape, mobility, adhesion and intracellular integrity as well as having a role in 
4/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the formation of the mitotic spindle during proliferation. Vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the 
vinca  binding  sites  inhibiting  its  polymerisation  into  microtubules,  which  results  in  treadmilling 
suppression,  disruption  of  microtubule  dynamic,  mitotic  arrestand  apoptosis.  In  vivo  vinflunine 
displays a significant antitumor activity against a broad spectrum of human xenografts in mice both in 
terms  of  survival  prolongation  and  tumour  growth  inhibition.In  common  with  other  Vinca  agents, 
vinflunine blocks cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and induces cell death via apoptosis.  
Javlor  is  indicated  in  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen. 
The efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients with a Performance Status ≥ 2. 
Vinflunine treatment should be initiated under the responsibility of a physician qualified in the use of 
anticancer chemotherapy.  Before each cycle, adequate monitoring of complete blood counts should be 
conducted to verify the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) as neutopenia is a frequent adverse reaction 
of vinflunine. 
The recommended posology is 320 mg/m² as a 20-minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. In case 
of    WHO/ECOG  Performance  Status  (PS)  of  1  or    of  0  and  prior  pelvic  irradiation,  the  treatment 
should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m². In the absence of any  haematological toxicity during the 
first cycle causing treatment delay or dose reduction, the dose will be increased to 320 mg/m² every 3 
weeks for the subsequent cycles. 
3.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
3.3  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Javlor is concentrate for solution for infusion and contains 25 mg/ml of vinflunine base as active 
substance (corresponding to 34.175 mg/ml of vinflunine ditartate). The finished product is available in 
50 mg/2 ml, 100 mg/4 ml and 250 mg/10 ml single-use vials. The container closure system is a type I 
colourless glass vial with a chlorobutyl or a laminated butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium flip-off 
seal. 
The other ingredients are water for injections and nitrogen (low oxygen). 
Javlor  is  diluted  with  a  suitable  parenteral  fluid,  sodium  chloride  0.9  %  solution  or  glucose  5% 
solution  to  obtain  a  solution  ranging  from  3  mg/ml  to  7  mg/ml  prior  to  intravenous  infusion. 
Compatible  admixture  fluids  and  administration  sets  have  been  qualified  and  use-times  and  storage 
conditions for diluted solutions for infusion have been established. 
Active Substance  
Its  chemical  name  is  ((2β,3β,4β,5α,12R,19α)-4-(acetyloxy)-6,7-didehydro-15-[(2R,4R,6S,8S)-4-(1,1-
difluoroethyl)-1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-octahydro-8-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,6-methano-2-Hazecino[4,3-b]indol-8-
yl]-3-hydroxy-16-methoxy-1-methyl-aspidospermidine-3-carboxylic  acid  methyl  ester,  (2R,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (1:2). 
5/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vinflunine ditartate is white to off-white powder, very hygroscopic and it is an amorphous substance. 
It  is  freely  soluble  in  water,  soluble  in  ethanol  and  practically  insoluble  in  dichloromethane.  It  is 
important to underline that this active substance has a strong buffering power. 
The  active  substance  has  9  chiral  centres  and  its  absolute  stereochemical  configuration  was 
established. In this context, the active substance will be used as single enantiomer (2R, 3S, 4R, 5R, 
12R, 19R, 2’S, 4’R, 18’S). 
•  Manufacture 
Vinflunine  ditartate  is  synthesised  in  nine  reactions  steps.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been 
adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls 
included.  Specifications  for  starting  materials,  reagents,  and  solvents  have  been  provided.  Adequate 
control  of  critical  steps  and  intermediates  has  been  presented.  The  active  substance  is  purified  by 
filtration and then undergoes lyophilisation allowing the isolation of the dried active substance. 
Structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  elemental  analysis,  mass  spectroscopy,  1H-NMR 
spectroscopy,  13C-NMR  spectroscopy,  19F-NMR  spectroscopy,  ultraviolet  spectroscopy,  infrared 
absorption spectroscopy and circular dichroïsm. 
The molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis which is in agreement with the expected 
molecular weight. The proposed molecular structure was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction 
and  the  absolute  stereochemistry  was  confirmed  with  data  from  NMR  spectroscopy  and  circular 
dichroïsm. 
•  Specification 
Vinflunine ditartate specifications include tests for appearance (white to off-white powder), solubility, 
Identification (IR, HPLC, TLC, Identification of tartrates), appearance of solution S (Ph.Eur), pH of 
solution S (Ph.Eur), absorbance of solution S (Ph.Eur), water content (Ph.Eur), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur), 
tartaric  acid  content  (Ph.Eur),  assay  residual  solvents  (Ph.Eur), 
impurities  (Ph.Eur)  and 
microbiological limit tests (Ph.Eur). 
All specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods, 
which were used in the routine controls, were carried out according to the general methods described 
in the Ph.Eur. 
Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, 
and qualified. Residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance according to the 
relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were  provided  and  all 
batch analysis results of 26 batches comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from 
batch to batch.  
•  Stability 
The  stability  results  from  long-term  (-20°C  ±  3°C)  and  accelerated  studies  (5  °C  ±  3°C)  were 
completed  according  to  ICH  guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  active  substance. 
During the stability studies the following parameters were controlled: appearance (white to off-white 
powder),  appearance  of  solution  S  (Ph.Eur),  pH  of  solution  S  (Ph.Eur),  absorbance  of  solution  S 
(Ph.Eur), water content (Ph.Eur), tartaric acid content (Ph.Eur), impurities, microbial contamination,

assay and LC assay. It was noticed that the test methods applied are those used for release of the drug 
substance  with  exception  of  LC  assay.  All  the  validation  parameters  have  been  submitted  for  this 
analytical  method  (LC  assay).  It  was  confirmed  that  the  active  substance  remained  within  the 
specifications for up to 48 months after long term storage at -20°C. Moreover, no major unexpected 
changes  were  observed  in  the  active  substance  after  storage  under  accelerated  stress  studies,  which 
were performed under heat, humidity, light, oxidation conditions and in solutions with different pH. 
Following the results from stress studies it was concluded that the active substance was sensitive to 
temperature, humidity and oxidation.  
The photosability study that was performed in accordance with the note for guidance on photostability 
testing  of  new  active  substances  and  medicinal  products  (CPMP/ICH/279/95)  confirmed  that  the 
active substance is photosensitive. 
Based  on  the  stability  results  it  was  concluded  that  the  active  substance  can  be  stored  48  months 
protected  from  light  in  the  proposed  container  closure  system  at  a  temperature  at  or  below  -15°C 
before being retested. 
Medicinal Product  
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified.  
The  main  objective  was  to  develop  a  stable,  sterile,  aqueous  solution  of  vinflunine  ditartrate  for 
intravenous administration. Based on the properties of the active substance an aqueous solution was 
selected for development. 
The concentration, which was used during the clinical trials, was changed to 25mg/ml in order to adapt 
the formulae to the recommended dose in human and reduce wastage of the medicinal product, which 
is  not  used.  The  final  formulation  contains  the  active  substance  at  a  concentration  of  25  mg/ml 
expressed as vinflunine base. The vehicle of this pharmaceutical form is water for injections and an 
inert gas (nitrogen low oxygen), which is used to protect the oxidation of the active substance. Good 
stability has been shown in unbuffered aqueous solution. Adjustment of the isotonicity of the finished 
product is not necessary since the administration is done by infusion after dilution in sodium chloride 
0.9 % solution or glucose 5% solution. Taking into account that Javlor is presented in single-use vials, 
which have been sterilised, no antimicrobial preservatives have been used  
Compatibility studies show that the finished product is stable with the proposed rubber stoppers and 
that there is no container-content incompatibility between the product diluted in sodium chloride 0.9% 
or glucose 5% solution at a concentration range between 3 mg/ml and 7 mg/ml and polyvinylchloride 
bag or polyethylene bag. This is accepted. The container closure system integrity is demonstrated by 
sampling  50  vials  from  the  media  fill  test  for  each  presentation  vials  and  the  results  show  negative 
microbial growth for all samples tested. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
This  Manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  steps:  mixing,  sterilisation,  filling  and 
packaging.  The  vials  are  washed  and  sterilised  by  dry  heat;  stoppers  and  flip-off  seals  are  steam 
sterilised using a validated cycle. The critical steps of this particular manufacturing process have been 
identified.  
Satisfactory process validation data have been provided for the major steps of the manufacturing 
process. All process validation batches are of maximum production scale size and all data are within 
specifications. 
The in process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. The batch analysis results show that 
the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the  agreed  finished  product 
specifications. 
7/89 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Product Specification 
The finished product specifications were established according the ICH guidelines and include the 
following tests: appearance, particulate contamination (Ph.Eur), identification (LC and UV), 
extractable volume (Ph.Eur), absorbance value at 420 nm (Ph.Eur), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur), 
related substances (LC), impurities (LC) and assay (Ph.Eur). It was noted that the impurity limits in 
the specification are justified by toxicology studies 
All relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines.  
The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly 
according the agreed finished product specifications. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The  stability  results  from  long-term  (5°C  ±  3°C)  and  accelerated  studies  (25  °C  60%  RH)  were 
completed  according  to  ICH  guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  finished  product.  All 
stress studies, which were preformed under stressing conditions (40 °C 75% RH), low temperatures, 
cold chain failure conditions, artificial lightning (photostability studies in accordance with the note for 
guidance on photostability testing - CPMP/ICH/279/95), have been performed, which are the extreme 
dosages. It was noticed that a detail justification for performing bracketing has been provided. 
Based on the results of the available stability data it can be concluded that the finished product must be 
protected from light. However, it was demonstrated that it can be exposed directly to ambient lighting 
not more than 1 day at room temperature. Javlor can undergo 1 or 2 freeze-thaw cycles from a freezing 
temperature  between -15°C and -25°C to a thawing between +2°C and + 8°C. It was verified that the 
authorised cold chain failure is limited to 14 days up to +30°C protected from light. Furthermore, it 
was demonstrated that Javlor diluted at 3 to 7 mg of the active substance per ml of sodium chloride 0.9 
% or glucose 5 % solution can be stored: in a polyethylene or polyvinylchloride bag for 1 day at room 
temperature protected from light, 6 days in the refrigerator (+2°C and + 8°C) protected from light or in 
a  polyethylene  or  polyvinylchloride  infusion  set  for  1  hour  at  room  temperature  (25°C)  exposed  to 
ambient  lighting.  From  a  microbiological  point  of  view,  the  finished  product  should  be  used 
immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use 
are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8°C, unless 
dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Finally it can be concluded that the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are 
acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product 
have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH 
guidelines. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was an unresolved quality issue, which will not 
have  an  impact  on  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out 
indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the finished product and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
3.3 
Non-clinical aspects  
Introduction 
The  non-clinical  development  programme  of  vinflunine  consisted  of  pharmacology  studies  (primary 
pharmacodynamics,  secondary  pharmacodynamics,  and  safety  pharmacology),  pharmacokinetic 
studies, toxicology  studies (single  dose toxicity,  repeat  dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicity, and local tolerance studies) and an environmental risk assessment.

Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
In vitro studies showed that VFL inhibits tubulin polymerisation, induces mitotic arrest and apoptotic 
cell  death.  These  studies  demonstrated  that  along  with  other  microtubule  inhibitors,  tubulin  was  a 
common intracellular target. VFL appears to suppress the rate and extent of microtubule growth and 
also suppresses microtubule treadmilling, but with a weaker potency than the other Vinca alkaloids.  
Microtubule treadmilling is necessary for normal chromosome progression through  mitosis, so these 
data  suggest  that  VFL  might  have  subtly  different  effects from  the  other  Vinca  alkaloids  on  certain 
mitotic events. 
Antitumour  activity  was  identified  in  three  other  murine  ‘solid’  tumour  models,  the  orthotopically-
transplantable  colon 
implanted  MB-49  bladder 
adenocarcinomas. Definite activity (defined by optimal T/C ranging from >135 to 179%) was reported 
with VFL against the sc-implanted M109 lung carcinoma using various multidose schedules. Overall 
antitumour activity with VFL was documented in five of the seven murine ‘solid’ tumours tested.  
the  MAC15A  and  MAC29 
tumour  and 
A summary of the in vitro studies conducted is represented in the table below.

Results 
VFL induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of 
L1210 murine leukaemia cell growth, with a dose-
response curve suggestive of a narrow dose-range of 
cytotoxicity. 
Using  this  method,  after  a  48-hour  drug  exposure,  the 
IC50 value obtained was 72 nM. 
Comparable results were obtained to the previous study 
(L0070-17492) 
VFL resulted in a similar pattern of cytotoxicity, versus 
the nine tumour cell lines to that of vinblastine and 
vinorelbine. The response induced by VFL was dose-
dependent, showing a plateau-shaped cytotoxic dose 
effect, observed with other tubulin-interacting agents. 
Flow cytometric analyses of cellular DNA content by 
propidium iodide staining of P388 leukaemia cells 
exposed to VFL showed an accumulation of cells in the 
G2+M phases of the cell cycle 
Exposure to VFL resulted in an accumulation of these 
cells in mitosis and that the proportion of these mitotic 
cells within the total population increased with 
increasing concentrations of VFL. 
VFL  induced  a  concentration-dependent  reduction  of 
the  microtubular  network  of  interphase  cells,  with 
complete loss occurring at 1 µM. At higher levels (> 10 
µM), VFL caused aggregation of microtubules with the 
formation of paracrystals.  
an 
increase  of  proteolysis  by 
VFL 
induced 
chymotrypsin,  without 
the  appearance  of  a  new 
proteolytic  band  known  to  form  in  the  presence  of 
bound  colchicine  and  podophyllotoxin.  VFL  also 
inhibited proteoloysis by trypsin, an effect noted in the 
presence of bound Vinca alkaloids. The binding of VFL 
to  tubulin  appears  to  induce  structural  changes  in 
tubulin  consistent  with  its  interaction  at  or  near  the 
Vinca binding domain 
VFL did not appear to inhibit significantly the binding 
of either tritiated colchicine or -vinorelbine to 
unpolymerised tubulin in vitro. When comparing the 
capacity of unlabeled Vinca alkaloids to VFL to inhibit 
the binding of 3H-vinorelbine to tubulin, the 
compounds tested could be classified (in terms of their 
competitive efficiencies, tubulin-binding affinities) as 
vincristine> vinblasine> VFL. 
Accumulation of VFL was higher than that of

VFL proved a less potent inducer of resistance than 
vinorelbine, as quantified by drug sensitivity

In vivo studies 
Data  from  human  tumour  xenografts  (applying  strict  application  of  NCI  toxicity  criteria),  showed 
definite  significant  activity  in  two  melanomas,  one  lung  and  one  renal  tumour,  whilst  moderate 
activity was noted in one pleura mesothelioma. (See table below),  
The data show that the in vivo activity of VFL against both murine and human tumour experimental 
models  was  achieved  at  considerably  higher  doses  than  those  of  vinorelbine.  Activity  of  VFL  was 
achieved in the absence of any significant body weight loss (i.e. ≤ 15%) or early deaths, in tumour-
bearing animals.

noted at 15 and 30 minutes after treatment. However, an increase 
in body temperature at 12.5 and 25 mg/kg, 24 hours after dosing 
was  also  noted.  No  other  effects  were  noted.  The  no-effect  dose 
was considered to be 6.25 mg/kg.

Evaluation of haemolytic activity of 
VFL 
VFL  at  a  concentration  of  10-4  M  induced  decreases  in  action 
potential  duration,  in  particular  APD50.  Decreases  in  the  plateau 
of action potential (APD50) and in maximal rate of depolarization, 
suggesting possible inhibition of calcium and/or sodium currents, 
were noted. 
VFL inhibited hERG current by 12.9% (n = 3), 37.7 % (n = 3) and 
70.1% (n = 3) at 3, 10 and 30µM, respectively. The calculated 
IC50 was 15.0 µM. 
The  primary  ECG  effect  was  a  dose-related  change  in  T  wave 
morphology and amplitude in some animals: 1/5 at 3 mg/kg, 2/5 at 
6  mg/kg  and  3/5  at  9  mg/kg.  These  morphology  and  amplitude 
changes returned to the baseline values 180 minutes after dosing.  
At 9 mg/kg, transient effects were noted on cardiovascular 
parameters but not on arterial blood gases. At 3 and 6 mg/kg, no 
significant effects on cardiovascular and arterial blood gases 
parameters were noted. 
No significant changes in PQ, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, heart 
rate, blood gases and blood biochemical parameters, were noted. 
However, the amplitude and morphology of the T-wave was 
altered. 
No  significant  effects  on  PQ,  QRS,  QT  and  QTc,  T  wave 
amplitude,  left  ventricular  end  diastolic  pressure,  heart  rate  and 
blood gases (pH, pO2, pCO2) or rectal temperature were found.  
No statistically significant effect on mean, systolic and diastolic 
arterial pressures over the 48-hour post-dosing period was noted. 
A statistically significant sinus tachycardia was seen from 
approximately 6 hours to 36 hours after dosing. 
The main effects seen in this study were a decrease in heart rate 
accompanied by an increase in RR interval and an increase in T 
wave amplitude. Heart rate decreased from a baseline mean of 156 
bpm to 135 bpm and showed partial recovery to 145 bpm, 120 min 
after administration, but had not completely recovered by 240 
minutes 
No statistically significant changes in respiratory parameters were 
noted at 20 mg/kg. At 40 and 60 mg/kg, a dose-dependent 
decrease in respiratory rate (- 38 to 41%), increases in inspiration 
(+ 44 to 48%), and expiration times (82 to 90%) and an increase in 
tidal volume (+ 55 to 59%) were seen. These effects were 
associated with a decrease in airway resistance at 60 mg/kg.

Effects of a single iv dose of VFL

VFL exhibited no relevant effect on diuresis, urinary

controls. 
VFL had no effect on the occurrence of hyperemia and ulcers in 
the gastric mucosa of the rat when compared with controls at any 
of the doses examined. 
At 12.5 or 25 mg/kg no effect on gastric emptying and intestinal 
transit in mice was noted. At 50 mg/kg, VFL significantly reduced 
gastric  emptying  (-  26  %)  of  the  test  meal,  but  did  not  effect 
intestinal transit.

ditartrate on gastric secretion in

VFL  had  no  effect  on  gastric  secretion  in  pylorus-ligated  rats  at 
0.67 or 2 mg/kg. At 6 mg/kg, VFL reduced the volume of gastric 
secretion and decreased total acidity, but did not affect the pH of 
gastric secretion, nor free and titratable acidity.

Study of the possible analgesic 
properties of a single intravenous dose 
of VFL in combination with a single

hot plate test in mice 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Doses of 3, 6 or 12 mg/kg VFL ditartrate did not modify arterial 
blood  gases.  It  did  not  change  the  respiratory  depressant  effect 
induced  by  morphine  given  i.v,  indicating  that  there  is  no 
interaction between morphine and VFL on respiratory function in 
this study. 
At 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, VFL increased the latency before pain 
appearance  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  This  slight  analgesic 
effect was not statistically significant 
The affinity of VFL ditartrate for various receptors was assessed in radioligand binding assays. At a 
concentration  of  1x10-5  M,  4-O  deacetyl  VFL  did  not  cause  any  significant  inhibition  of  specific 
radioligand  binding  at  the  receptors  studied,  which  indicates  that  it  is  devoid  of  affinity  for  these 
receptors at this concentration.  However, the study showed a micromolar affinity of VFL for opiate 
non selective receptors and µ receptors with a Ki value of 1120 nM. This was nearly 1000-fold higher 
than that of the reference agonist opioid peptide. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  iv  route  of  administration  was  used  exclusively  for  all  studies  described  (mouse,  rat  ,dog, 
monkey).  Rats  and  monkeys  were  the  principal  species  selected  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  VFL. 
Additional pharmacokinetic studies were conducted using 4-O-deacetyl VFL (DVFL) to document the 
contribution of this active metabolite to the toxicological profile of VFL.   
Single  dose  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  blood  and  plasma  samples,  were  performed  with 
radiolabelled  VFL  ([3H]-VFL),  while  toxicokinetic  studies  were  performed  after  both  single  or 
repeated doses with non-radiolabelled drugs.  
Overall, (in all species) exposure (AUC) was dose-proportional and was generally linear. In all four 
species, the pharmacokinetics of VFL in blood was characterised by a decrease in concentration over 
the first hours post i.v. bolus followed by slower distribution and elimination phases. The elimination 
half-life of total radioactivity was close to 100 h while T½z of unchanged VFL varied from 4 to 20 
hours.  Tissue  distribution  was  large  (volume  of  distribution  between  12  and  36  L/kg).  No  drug 
accumulation was noticed after repeated administrations over 26 weeks in monkeys whereas a trend to 
accumulation  was  suggested  in  rats  after  4-week  and  26-week  administration.  A  high  volume  of 
distribution suggests extensive tissue uptake. 
In vitro studies performed with human liver microsomes showed that VFL had neither inducing effects 
on  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6  or  CYP3A4  activity  nor  inhibition  effects  on  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (see SPC section 4.5).

In vitro pharmacodynamic studies showed that vinflunine is a Pgp-substrate as the other vinca 
alkaloids, but with a lower affinity. Therefore, risks of clinically significant interactions should be 
unlikely. 
DVFL  was  found to  be  a major  metabolite  in  man.  DVFL  was  observed  in  blood,  urine  and  faeces 
from all species. Single doses of DVFL were investigated in rats and monkeys (1 mg/kg in rats and 6 
mg/kg  in  monkeys).  Pharmacokinetics  of  DVFL  was  characterised  by  a  slow  distribution  and 
elimination  phase. The  terminal  elimination  half-life was  about  34 h  and  45  h in  rats  and  monkeys, 
respectively.

The neutropaenia, lymphopaenia, and decreases in erythropoiesis 
that occurred at 60 mg/kg were severe 5 days after dosing and were 
in general reversible following a 1-month recovery period 
The LD0 was < 60 mg/kg (180 mg/m2) for males and 60 mg/kg (180

At dose levels  ≥8.96 mg/kg leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and anaemia 
indicative  of  bone-marrow  toxicity  were  noted.  Increases  in  ALT

Test article-related findings included leukopaenia, neutropaenia, and 
anaemia  at  all  doses  and  were  considered  attributable  to  bone-
marrow  toxicity;  and  the  increases  in  liver  enzymes  at  9  and  12 
mg/kg  were  considered  attributable  to  liver  toxicity.  These  changes 
were reversible at the 9 mg/kg, and the MTD was considered to be 
approximately 9 mg/kg (180 mg/m2).

attributed to bone-marrow toxicity. The MTD was considered to be 
approximately 16 mg/kg (192 mg/m2). 
Systemic single-dose exposures (24-hour area under the concentration-time curve [AUC0-24]) to VFL 
in  dogs  and  monkeys  were  similar between  males  and  females. Mean single-dose  IV  systemic  VFL

•  Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeated-dose  i.v.  toxicity  studies  completed  with  VFL  included  a  5-day  study  in  mice,  pivotal  1-
month studies in rats and monkeys, a 3-month study in rats and 6-month studies in rats and monkeys. 
Dosing in the rat and monkey studies was intermittent and occurred twice weekly. The main signs of 
toxicity in the subchronic and chronic toxicology studies of VFL are weight loss, haematological and 
clinical  chemistry  changes,  mainly  neutropaenia.  These  toxicities  are  expected  based  on  the 
pharmacological  effects  of  VFL  and  have  been  demonstrated  to  be  either  partially  or  completely 
reversible. The bone-marrow and liver were also target organs.

•  Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  VFL  was  evaluated  in  a  battery  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies.  VFL  is 
positive  in  mutagenicity  and  genotoxicity  assays.  The  table  below  summarizes  the  results  of  these 
studies.

Results 
VFL was considered to be not 
mutagenic 
VFL was mutagenic and clastogenic 
without metabolic activation in 
mammalian mouse lymphoma cells. 
VFL and vincristine were clastogenic 
in the rat micronucleus test. At 
equitoxic doses, the clastogenic activity 
of VFL was lower than that of 
vincristine 
•  Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  were submitted. The  carcinogenic  potential of VFL has  not  been  studied 
according to ICH S1A and CPMP/SWP/99796. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  VFL  (IV)  include  assessment  of 
potential effects on fertility and reproductive function in male and female rats, evaluations of embryo-
fetal  development  in  rats  and  rabbits  and  effects  on  pre-  and  post-natal  development  in  rats. 
Preliminary, dose range-finding studies in rats and rabbits were conducted to assist in dose selection 
for  the  pivotal  reproductive  toxicity  studies.  Exposure  assessments  were  conducted  in  the  rabbit 
embryo-fetal development study. 
In the rat embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity were noted, characterized by increased number of dams with 
no  viable  fetuses,  increased  early  resorptions,  postimplantation  loss  and  reduced  fetal  weights  at 
higher  doses.  In  the  rabbit,  higher  doses  of  VFL  were  embryotoxic  and  teratogenic  (malformations 
included  cleft  palates,  exophthalmia,  microtia,  anotia,  dome-shaped  head,  cranioschisis,  misshapen 
head  or  vertebral  bones,  hemivertebrae,  fused  or  divided  ribs,  and  reduced  ossification  of  head, 
vertebrae  or  talus).  In  the  rat  ppn  study,  maternal  toxicity  was  evident  in  F0  generation  dams.  In 
addition, decrease in body weight gain and decreases in food consumption were seen in the undosed 
F1 adult females. At higher doses, malformations of the uterus and vagina and a reduced number of 
conceptuses were observed in F1 generation females. 
A  number  of  malformations  were  noted  in  the  rat  embryo  toxicity  study.  These  findings  might  be 
considered  to  indicative  of  teratogenicity.  Therefore,  both  male  and  female  patients  should  take 
adequate contraceptive measures up to three months after the discontinuation of the therapy. Advice 
on conservation of sperm should be sought prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible 
infertility due to therapy with vinflunine. (see section 4.6 of the SPC). 
Due  to  the  possible  very  harmful  effects  on  the  infants,  breast-feeding  during  the  treatment  with 
vinflunine is contraindicated (see section 4.3 of the SPC).  
•  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  evaluations  were  conducted  in  rats  and  monkeys  as  part  of  the  repeat  dose  i.v. 
toxicology studies with VFL. There were not gender differences neither drug accumulation based on 
AUC observed in the different studies (Tables 8 and 9).

Description 
In vitro study of the cytotoxicity of 
VFL and vinorelbine ditartrate on 
skin cells 
Evaluation of the ocular irritation 
potentially induced by VFL in the 
rabbit 
Local tolerance of VFL in the rabbit

rabbits 
Results 
VFL and vinorelbine had no adverse 
effect on human epidermal cells at the 
concentrations studied 
VFL without ocular rinsing was 
considered a slight irritant. 
VFL was well tolerated after i.v. 
injection, but it induced vascular 
irritation when administered 
perivascularly or intraarterially at a 
concentration of 2 mg/mL 
25  mg/mL  VFL  was  an  irritant,  in 
particular on abraded skin, but was not 
a vesicant. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
The  table  below  summarizes  additional  toxicity  studies  submitted.  The  major  human  metabolite  of 
VFL  and  the  only  one  active  is  4-O-deacetyl  VFL  (DVFL).  DVFL  was  tested  in  a  battery  of 
nonclinical toxicity studies listed below. The non-clinical safety of VFL impurities was also evaluated 
in several studies listed below.

Four week toxicity study by the intravenous route in rat -
VFL vs DVFL 
VFL, vincristine and paclitaxel were equally toxic to bone-
marrow progenitor cells, whereas vinorelbine was more toxic 
than these compounds.   
At  concentrations  ≤  0.01  µg/mL,  VFL  had  no  neurotoxic 
effects on DRG neurons; whereas vincristine and vinorelbine 
were  toxic  at  all  concentrations.  In  this  in  vitro  model,  the 
neurotoxicity of VFL was lower than that of vincristine and 
vinorelbine. 
The  toxicity  of  DVFL  was  considered  to  be  limited  to  the 
irritant  properties  of  this  type  of  compound  at  the  site  of 
administration and did not appear to contribute to the toxicity 
of VFL.

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  submitted  an  ERA.  The  Log  Kow  for  vinflunine  was  below  4.5.    The  calculation  of 
PECsw using this Fpen and a maximum daily dose of 320 mg/m2 would be equal to 0.000726 µg/L, 
i.e. a value far below the threshold of concern for environment, that is 0.01 µg/L . 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant  had  conducted  an  extensive  programme  of  pharmacology 
studies,  indicating  that  VFL  has  a  relevant  pharmacodynamic  effect.  The  applicant  also  conducted 
adequate  safety  pharmacology  and  pharmacokinetics  programmes.  Rats  and  monkeys  were  the 
principal  species  selected  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  VFL.  A  small  number  of  pharmacokinetic 
studies were conducted using 4-O-deacetyl VFL (DVFL) to document the contribution of this active 
metabolite to the toxicological profile of VFL.  The single-dose studies were adequate and no further 
studies were required. The intravenous infusion studies provided sufficient information on toxicity at 
higher  doses.  The  duration  of  repeat-dose  studies  was  also  considered  adequate  and  the  absence  of 
carcinogenicity  studies  was  adequately  justified.  An  acceptable  programme  of  genotoxicity  studies 
was conducted.  VFL is positive in mutagenicity and genotoxicity assays. Given the pharmacology of 
the compound and the proposed indication, this was considered acceptable. The carcinogenic potential 
of  VFL  was  not  studied,  according  to  ICH  S1A  or  CPMP/SWP/99796.  In  the  reproductive  toxicity 
studies performed, embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity were noted.

During the evaluation of the non-clinical data submitted as part of this dossier, the following concerns 
were identified. 
1. The applicant was requested to modify the wording of section 4.4 and 5.3 of the SPC regarding the 
cardiac  safety  of  vinflunine.  The  safety  margins  provided  from  the  Purkinje  assay  along  with  no 
adverse  cardiac  events  in  the  monkey  up  to  16  mg/kg,  provided  some  reassurance  regarding 
vinflunine’s  potential  to  alter  ventricular  repolarization,  however  given  that  there  were  other  test 
article-related  cardiovascular  findings  in  some  other  non-clinical  studies  and    agents  that  disrupt 
normal microtubules function have shown to affect essential cardiac activities, the statement in section 
5.3 of the SPC (‘’Vinflunine did not induce peripheral neuropathy nor cardiotoxicity in animals’’) was 
modified to delete the reference to cardiotoxicity. Section 4.4 of the SPC was also amended to include 
a  statement  for  the  management  of  patients  with  prior  history  of  myocardial  infarction/ischemia  or 
angina pectoris.  
2.  A  number  of  malformations  that  may  be  considered  indicative  of  developmental  toxicity 
(teratogenicity) were noted in the pregnant rat. In addition, malformed fetuses from 2 litters containing 
1 or 2 viable fetuses were noted. The resorption rate in these litters was high, possibly suggesting that 
this finding might have been due to possible malformations in the resorbed fetuses. Malformations of 
the uterus and vagina (2 females has closed vaginas) were noted in the rabbit; these were not reported 
in the rat. The applicant was therefore asked to discuss further information on the precise nature of the 
skeletal observations noted, whether the malformations are considered species specific, and to address 
their clinical relevance. In response to this concern, Section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC were amended as 
follows.  
SPC Section 4.6 Pregnancy: 
There  is  no  data  available  about  the  use  of  vinflunine  in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in  animals  have 
shown embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). On the basis of the results of animal studies 
and  the  pharmacological  action  of  the  product,  there  is  a  potential  risk  of  embryonic  and  foetal 
abnormalities.  
Vinflunine should therefore not be used during pregnancy, unless it is strictly necessary. If pregnancy 
occurs  during  treatment,  the  patient  should  be  informed  about  the  risk  for  the  unborn  child  and  be 
monitored carefully. The possibility of genetic counselling should be considered. Genetic counselling 
is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy.  
SPC Section 5.3 Preclinical safety data:  
In  the  reproduction  studies,  vinflunine  appeared  to  be  embryolethal  and  teratogenic  in  rabbits  and 
teratogenic  in  rats.  During  the  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  in  rat,  vinflunine  induced 
malformations  of  the  uterus  and  vagina  in  2  females,  and  adversely  affected  mating  and/or  ovule 
implantation and markedly lowered the number of concepti. 
Section 4.3 of the SPC reflects the following: 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, other vinca alkaloids. 
Recent (within 2 weeks) or current severe infection. 
Baseline ANC < 1,500/mm3 or platelets < 100,000/mm3 
Lactation (see section 4.6) 
3.4   Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical development programme of vinflunine consisted of pharmacokinetic studies (distribution, 
excretion,  metabolism,  dose  proportionality,  special  populations,  drug-drug  interactions  and 
safety/interaction studies), pharmacodynamic studies, and main clinical studies. 
19/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical development program for solid malignancies included the following studies as a single 
agent: 
-5 completed Phase I studies  
-4 ongoing Phase I studies  
-10 completed Phase II studies (variety of tumour types including melanoma, metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, advanced ovarian cancer) 
-1 completed Phase III study (NSCLC) 
-1 ongoing Phase II study (metastatic breast) 
-1 Phase II study in gastric cancer (premature termination) 
Studies in combination therapy were: 
- 4 completed Phase I/II studies 
- 4 ongoing Phase I/II studies  
- 1 Phase I/II (early termination)  
- 1 ongoing Phase III study, in HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer 
- 1 Phase III study in first line treatment of TCCU 
For  the  proposed  indication,  the  clinical  program  for  vinflunine  in  second-line  treatment  in  patients 
with TCCU after platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens includes: 
- 3 phase I trials (VFL 981, VFL 991, VFL 992) 
- 2 phase II studies (VFL202, CA 001) 
- 1 randomised Phase III study (VFL 302) 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  were  evaluated  in  cancer  patients.  The  tumours  of  the  patients  who 
participated in the phase I/II clinical trials included all types of solid cancer, such as bladder cancer 
(Urothelial Transitional Cell Carcinoma of Urothelium, TCCU), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
and breast cancer. 
Vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  is  linear  in  the  range  of  administered  doses  (from  30 mg/m²  to 
400 mg/m2) in cancer patients. 
Blood exposure to vinflunine (AUC), significantly correlated with severity of leucopenia, neutropenia 
and fatigue.

•  Methods  
Two  types  of  bioanalytical  methods  were  used  to  quantify  VFL  and  its  metabolites  in  human 
biological samples:  
−  Methods  dealing  with  radiolabelled  detection  and  measurement,  used  to  explore  the  in  vitro 
plasma proteins and blood cells binding and the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of VFL (Study L0070 
99  IN103  Q0).  These  methods  consisted  of  liquid  scintillation  counting  of  β  particles  emitted  by 
tritium from 3H-VFL and 3H-metabolites. HPLC methods were generally used for controls. 
−  Methods for non-radiolabelled detection, used to quantize of unchanged VFL and its metabolites in 
biological fluids.  
HPLC/UV: The HPLC/UV technique was the method employed in most of the clinical studies, in 
order to measure VFL and 4-O-deacetylvinflunine (DVFL) in blood and VFL in urine. In blood, 
the  method  is  linear  from  2-200  ng/mL  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  at  2  ng/mL 
(coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  <  7%)  and  in  urine,  from  20  and  2000  ng/mL  with  LLOQ  at  20 
ng/mL (CV < (3%). The intraday and interday precision and accuracy values were evaluated on 6 
replicates  of  quality  control  (QC)  samples  processed  over  3  days  and  they  were  within  usual 
acceptance limits of QC samples for daily run (15% at each concentration level: low, middle, and 
high).  
Most of the bioanalyses were performed in a single laboratory however a few ones (studies L00070 
IN108 J1, L00070 IN110 B0, L00070 IN111 B0, L00070 IN208 E2 and L00070 IN210 J3) were 
completed in another facilityA cross-validation of the HPLC method was performed comparing the 
results from the two laboratories and before analysis of the biological samples obtained from the 
concerned studies. The mean bias between the two laboratories was 6.3% for VFL and 13.7% for 
DVFL. The individual deviations of 8 out of 10 samples were within the acceptability limits (i.e. ≤ 
± 15%). VFL and DVFL chemical stability in stored samples from clinical trials was demonstrated 
to be sufficient for easy routine use of the bioanalytical methods. 
LC/MS-MS:  A  HPLC  method  followed  by  tandem  mass  spectrometry  detection.  This  method  was 
used for metabolites identification from human biological samples (blood, urine and faeces) by ATC 
laboratories (Study M821 and Study 20968) and for assessing the mass-balance distribution of VFL 
and its metabolites after  3H-VFL administration (Study 9 L0070 99 IN 103 Q0). In addition, it was 
used for evaluating in vivo the potential PK drug-drug interaction (DDI) with  ketoconazole (Study 
CA183009).  
The  method  was  linear  over  the  range:  0.25-1.000  ng/mL  for  VFL  en  blood,  0.25-200  ng/mL  for 
DVFL in blood, 20-  5000  ng/mL  in  urine  and  2-1000  µg/g  in  faeces  for  both  compounds.  The 
intraday and interday precision (CV %) calculated on QC samples were less than 6.9% and 15.9% for 
VFL and 7.1% and 5.2% for DVFL in blood while the accuracy (mean bias, %) was lower than 9.1% 
and 7.1% for VFL and DVFL,  
respectively.  In  urine  and  faeces,  the  precision  (CV  %)  was 
lower than 5.6% in urine and 8.2% in faeces. The accuracy (mean bias, %) was lower than 7% in both 
media for both compounds. 
Both HPLC/UV and LC/MS-MS methods were developed and validated according to GLP.   
•  Absorption  
No absorption studies were submitted. 
•  Distribution 
Vinflunine is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (67.2±1.1%) with a  ratio between plasma 
and  whole  blood  concentrations  of  0.80±0.12.  Protein  binding  mainly  involves  high  density 
lipoproteins  and  serum  albumin  and  is  non-saturable  on  the  range  of  vinflunine  concentrations 
22/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
observed in patients. Binding to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and to platelets is negligible (< 5%). The 
terminal  volume  of  distribution  is  large,  2422±676 litres  (about 35 l/kg)  suggesting  extensive 
distribution  into tissues.  
•  Elimination 
The PK of vinflunine and its metabolites were studied after a 15-min infusion of 3H-VFL at a single 
dose of 250 mg/m². Blood samples were collected over 7 days, while urine and faeces were collected 
over  14  days.  Total  radioactivity  in  blood,  urine  and  faeces  was  measured  by  liquid  scintillation 
counting (LSC) and vinflunine and metabolites were quantified according to LC/MS-MS method.

The metabolism of vinflunine was examined in both in vitro and in vivo studies. From in vitro studies 
(hepatic  microsomes,  hepatocytes  cultures,  insect  transfected  cells).  A  total  of  11  metabolites  are 
detected in blood, urine and faeces. 
7 metabolites were directly formed from vinflunine in one step reaction: 
•  DVFL (M1 – the only active metabolite); VFL 3,6 ether (M2); desmethyl-VFL (M4); VFL 6’-
oxide  (M9);  2  isomers  of  hydroxy-VFL  (M3,  M6/7)  and  one  unidentified  structure  named 
815d (M13) 
Sequential metabolism is presumed for 4 other structures: 
•  Di-hydroxy-VFL  (M10),  desmethyl-VFL  3,6  ether  (M15),  desmethyl-815d  (M16)  and 
hydroxy VFL 3,6 ether (M18) 
Major metabolites were: 
•  DVFL  (M1),  VFL  3,6  ether  (M2),  desmethyl  VFL  (M4)  and  VFL  6'-oxide  (M9).  All  other 
metabolites were either minor or detected at trace levels 
Vinflunine is eliminated following a multi-exponential concentration decay, with a terminal half-life (t 
½)    close  to  40 h.  DVFL  is  slowly  formed  and  more  slowly  eliminated  than  vinflunine  (t  ½of 
approximately 120 h).The excretion of vinflunine and its metabolites occurs through faeces (2/3) and 
urine (1/3). In a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 372 patients (656 pharmacokinetic profiles), 
23/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  total  blood  clearance  was  40 l/h  with  low  inter  and  intra-individual  variability  (25%  and  8%, 
respectively, expressed as coefficient of variation). 
All  metabolites  identified  are    formed  by  the  cytochrome  CYP3A4  isoenzyme,  except  for 
4Odeacetylvinflunine  (DVFL),  the  only  active  metabolite  and  main  metabolite  in  blood  which  is 
formed by multiple esterases.  The characterisation of human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved 
in  vinflunine  metabolism  shows  that  other  isoenzymes  studied  were  either  not  or  weakly  involved 
(CYP1A2,  CYP2D6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6  and  CYP2E1  were  not 
involved).  DVFL  was  not  generated  by  CYP  but  formed  through  multiple  esterases.  The  metabolic 
pathway of vinflunine involves both the nor 7' velbanamine and vindoline parts of the molecule. All 
structures went through phase I reactions. Phase II enzymes are not involved in vinflunine metabolism. 
No conjugated metabolite was observed.  
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A phase I and PK study of vinflunine given as a 10-minute infusion every 3 weeks was carried out to 
explore the PK profile of vinflunine. Ten dose levels of vinflunine from 30 mg/m² up to 400 mg/m² 
were administered and PK assessment was performed in 30 patients. 
Vinflunine blood concentrations vs. time profiles were characterized by a sharp concentration decrease 
over  the  first  30  minutes  following  the  end  of  infusion  and  then  demonstrated  a  slower  distribution 
/elimination phase (data not shown).  
The mean VFL total clearance was high (Cltot = 41.4 ± 12.9 L/h or 0.63 ± 0.23 L/h/kg) and its inter-
individual  variability  (calculated  by  coefficient  of  variation  from  the  30  patients)  was  31%.. 
Vinflunine  terminal  volume  of  distribution  was  large  (Vdz  =  1517 ± 503  L  or 22.8  ± 8.3  L/kg)  and 
terminal  half-life  (calculated  over  a  96-hour  period)  was  25.5  ± 3.9  h.  The  table  below  shows  that 
vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  is  linear  in  the  range  of  administered  doses  (from  30 mg/m²  to 
400 mg/m2) in cancer patients.

•  Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
A pharmacokinetic phase I study in patients with renal impairment is ongoing. An interim analysis on 
13 patients with moderate impairment (40 ml/min ≤ CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min) and on 9 patients with severe 
impairment (20 ml/min ≤ CrCl < 40 ml/min) indicated a decreased elimination of both vinflunine and 
DVFL when CrCl is decreased. This is further confirmed by the population pharmacokinetic analysis 
(56  patients  with  CrCl  between  20 ml/min  and  60 ml/min),  showing  that  vinflunine  clearance  is 
influenced  by  the  creatinine  clearance  value  (Cockcroft  and  Gault  formula).  Dose  adjustments  are 
recommended in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment(see section 4.2 of the SPC).  
Two doses are proposed in the SPC: Moderate renal impairment 280 mg/m² (a 12.5% dose decrease),   
Severe renal impairment 250 mg/m² (a 22% dose decrease)  
Impaired hepatic function 
A  phase  I  PK  dose  adjusted  study  of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  liver  dysfunction  was 
carried out to determine the recommended dose of vinflunine and to investigate the PK and tolerability 
of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  chronic  liver  dysfunction.  Three  groups  were  scheduled 
according to the liver dysfunction and the patients received 320 mg/m² (groups 1 and 2), 250 mg/m² 
(groups 2 and 3) or 200 mg/m² (group 3) on day 1 every 3 weeks depending on tolerance.  
No  modification  of  vinflunine  and  DVFL  pharmacokinetics  was  observed  in  25  patients  presenting 
varying  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment,  compared  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function.  This  is 
further  confirmed  by  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (absence  of  relationship  between 
vinflunine  clearance  and  biology  markers  of  hepatic  impairment).  However,  dose  adjustments  are 
recommended in patients with level 2 or 3 liver impairment (see section 4.2 of the SPC).  
According  to  pharmacokinetic  analysis  and  safety  data  the  recommended  doses  in  this  specific 
population are as follows: 
• 
In  patients  with  mild  liver  dysfunction  the  recommended  dose  of  vinflunine  is  320  mg/m² 
given on day 1 every 3 weeks. 
•  For patients with moderate chronic liver dysfunction the recommended dose of vinflunine is 
• 
250 mg/m² once every 3 weeks 
In patients with severe chronic liver dysfunction the recommended dose of VFL is 200 mg/m² 
once every 3 weeks. 
Gender, race, weight, elderly, children 
No  specific  studies  were  submitted  with  regards  to  gender,  race  or  weight.  No  specific  studies  in 
children were submitted either. According to the population pharmacokinetic analysis, neither gender 
nor  Performance  Status  (ECOG  score)  had  an  impact  on  vinflunine  clearance  which  is  directly 
proportional to body surface area.A study in elderly patients is ongoing. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Studies  using  human  biomaterials  (microsomes,  hepatocytes)  or  human  biological  samples  (e.g.: 
blood,  plasma,  urine  and  faeces)  were  performed  to  determine  the  binding  characteristics  of 
vinflunine,  its  metabolism  and  potential  in  vitro  drug-drug  interaction.  CYP  3A4  is  the  major 
cytochrome  enzyme  involved  in  vinflunine  metabolism  and  therefore  strong  inhibitors  of  CYP  3A4 
are likely to affect the metabolism of vinflunine. An in vitro drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was 
carried out with selected drugs. 
A pharmacokinetic interaction between vinflunine and pegylated/liposomal doxorubicin was observed, 
resulting in a 15% to 30% apparent increase in vinflunine exposure and a 2 to 3-fold apparent decrease 
of doxorubicin AUC, whereas doxorubicinol metabolite concentrations were not affected. According 
25/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to an in vitro study, such changes could be related to an adsorption of vinflunine on the liposomes and 
a modified blood distribution of both compounds. Therefore, caution should be excercised when this 
type of combination is used. 
Twenty-five  drugs  were  screened  to  assess  the  risk  of  DDI  on  vinflunine  metabolism  (Anastrozole, 
Imatinib,  Gefitinib,  Paclitaxel, 
Cyclophosphamide,  Docetaxel,  Doxorubicin,  Epirubicin, 
Aminoglutethimide,  Fluconazole,  Fluoxetine,  Itraconazole,  Morphine,  Norfluoxetine,  Omeprazole, 
Ondansetron,  Acenocoumarol,  Ketoconazole,  Methadone,  Metoclopramide,  Midazolam,  Nifedipine, 
Phenprocoumon,  Ritonavir,  Testosterone).  The  risk  of  drug-drug  interaction  was  evaluated  on 
Weaver’s  algorithm.  The  results  showed  that:  Ketoconazole,  Itraconazole  and  Ritonavir  may  inhibit 
vinflunine metabolism, DDI may be suspected for paclitaxel and docetaxel, and DDI was unlikely for 
the other 20 drugs. 
Thus, A possible interaction with paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP3 substrates) has been suggested from 
an in vitro study (slight inhibition of vinflunine metabolism). No specific clinical studies of vinflunine 
in combination with these compounds have been carried out yet. 
In vivo 
A  phase  I  study  evaluating  the  effect  of  ketoconazole  treatment  (a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor)  on 
vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  indicated  that  co-administration  of  ketoconazole  (400 mg  orally  once 
daily  for  8  days)  resulted  in  a  30%  and  50%  increase  of  blood  exposures  to  vinflunine  and  its 
metabolite 4Odeacetyl-vinflunine (DVFL), respectively.  
Therefore  the  concomitant  use  of  vinflunine  and  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (such  as  ritonavir, 
ketoconazole,  itraconazole  and  grapefruit  juice)  or  inducers  (such  as  rifampicine  and  Hypericum 
perforatum  (St John’s  wort)) should  be  avoided  since  they  may  increase  or  decrease  vinflunine  and 
DVFL concentrations (see section 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC). Based on these data and safety results, the 
recommended  dose  of  vinflunine  is  defined  as  160  mg/m²  when  co-administered  with  400  mg  of 
ketoconazole. 
Risk  of  DDI  was  assessed  in  vinflunine  combined  chemotherapy  with  cisplatin  (CDDP),  with 
carboplatin  (CBDCA),  with  liposomal  doxorubicin,  with  doxorubicin,  with  capecitabine,  and  with 
gemcitabine. The last 3 studies are still ongoing while the first 3 are completed. A pharmacokinetic 
interaction between vinflunine and pegylated/liposomal doxorubicin was observed, resulting in a 15% 
to 30% apparent increase in vinflunine exposure and a 2 to 3-fold apparent decrease of doxorubicin 
AUC,  whereas  doxorubicinol  metabolite  concentrations  were  not  affected.  According  to  an  in  vitro 
study, such changes could be related to an adsorption of vinflunine on the liposomes and a modified 
blood  distribution  of  both  compounds.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  excercised  when  this  type  of 
combination is used.. 
Overall, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when vinflunine was combined with 
either cisplatin, carboplatin, capecitabine, doxorubicin or gemcitabine.

•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Three  phase  I  trials  were  conducted  (VFL  981,  VFL 991  and  VFL  992)  with  the  main  objective  of 
determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Dose (RD). MTD and the 
RD were determined for each schedule of vinflunine administration: once every 3  weeks (on day1), 
weekly administration (on day 1), and twice every 3 weeks (on days 1 and 8). 
Table 17. Vinflunine - Phase I studies 
VFL 981 
This was a phase I study, assessing the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine given as a 10 minute infusion 
once every 3 weeks. The study was a dose escalating phase I multi-centre (3 centres in France), open 
label, non-randomised trial. The study was carried out between 1st December 1998 and 23rd March 
2000.  The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  MTD  of  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  (several 
tumour  types).  Secondary  objectives  were  to  determine  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  toxicities  of 
vinflunine, their duration and reversibility, to determine the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine, to search 
for relationships between the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine and clinical toxicities and to assess anti-
tumour  activity  in  patients  with  measurable  and  or  evaluable  disease.  Vinflunine  was  given 
intravenously  as  a  10  minute  infusion  at  a  fixed  dose  and  repeated  every  21  days  according  to  the 
observed toxicities. 
31  patients  were  evaluable.  The  MTD  of  vinflunine  administered  in  a  10  minute  infusion  every  3 
weeks is 400 mg/m². The RD for further trials is 350 mg/m² every 3 weeks. This dose was evaluated in 
6 patients for a total of 11 cycles, having an acceptable safety profile. Three responses were seen: 2 at 
400 mg/m² and 1 at 350 mg/m². The pharmacokinetics of vinflunine was shown to be linear with the 
administered  doses.  Inter-individual  variability  was  moderate.  Leucopenia  and  neutropenia  were 
correlated to vinflunine exposure. 
VFL 991 
This was a phase I study, assessing the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine given as a 10-minute infusion 
on  a  weekly  schedule.  The  study  was  a  dose  escalating  phase  I  multi-centre  (3  centres  -  France, 
Switzerland, Belgium), open label, non-randomised trial. The study was carried out between the 4th 
October 1999 and the 18th June 2003. The primary objective was to determine the MTD of vinflunine 
in cancer patients (several tumour types). Following amendment 3 (April 12th, 2000) it was decided to 
determine  separately  MTD  of  weekly  vinflunine  when  administered  to  either  pre-treated  patients 
(Group  A)  or  previously  untreated  patients  (chemonaive  patients,  Group  B).  Secondary  objectives 
included  determination  of  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  toxicities  of  vinflunine,  to  define  their 
duration  and  reversibility,  to  determine  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vinflunine,  to  explore  the 
reproducibility  over  administrations  after  repeated  administration,  to  document  intra  and  inter-

individual  variability  and  to  search  for  relationship  between  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vinflunine  to 
clinical toxicities observed and to assess anti-tumour activity. 
In Group A, 14 patients were evaluated in 3 dose levels of weekly vinflunine. The MTD was reached 
at 190 mg/m²/week and the RD established at 120 mg/m²/week. In Group B, 26 chemonaive patients, 
the  MTD  was  not  determined  even  if  high  doses  (250  mg/m²)  were  investigated;  the  RD  was 
established at 150 mg/m²/weekly. In both groups, dose limiting toxicities consisted of haematological 
related  toxicities,  infection,  severe  neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia.  A  single  patient  in  group  A 
presented  with  a  transient  increase  in  liver  enzymes  (declared  as  a  DLT).  No  other  significant 
modification  in  liver  enzymes  was  seen.  The  recommended  doses  were  associated  with  a  good 
tolerance  profile,  mainly  consisting  of  mild  nausea  and  vomiting,  no  severe  neutropenia,  no 
thrombocytopenia or anaemia. Leucopenia and neutropenia were correlated to vinflunine exposure. 
 VFL 992 
This was a phase I study, assessing the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine given as a 10-minute infusion 
on  days  1  and  8  every  3  weeks  a  weekly  schedule.  The  study  was  a  dose  escalating  phase  I  multi-
centre  (France,  UK),  open  label,  non-randomised  trial.  The  study  was  carried  out  between  21st 
October 1999 and 1st September 2000. The primary objective was to determine the MTD of vinflunine 
in  cancer  patients  (several  tumour  types).  Secondary  objectives  included  determining  the  qualitative 
and quantitative toxicities of vinflunine given, to define their duration and reversibility, to explore the 
pharmacokinetics reproducibility over cycles of vinflunine after repeated administrations, to document 
intra  and  inter-individual  variability  at  different  dose  levels,  to  search  for  relationship  between  the 
pharmacokinetics of vinflunine and the observed clinical toxicities and to assess anti-tumour activity. 
The MTD of vinflunine administered in a 10-minute infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks is 190 
mg/m².  RD  for  further  trials  is  170  mg/m².  This  dose  was  evaluated  in  6  patients  for  a  total  of  10 
cycles  with  an  acceptable  safety  profile.  Leucopenia  and  neutropenia  were  correlated  to  vinflunine 
blood exposure. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No secondary pharmacology studies were submitted. 
•  Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
Drug-drug interaction studies are ongoing. 
•  Genetic differences in PD response 
No data was submitted concerning genetic determinants of drug response. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology aspects 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacokinetic  data  submitted  was  satisfactory  and  the  main  PK 
characteristics had been adequately determined. The analytical methods were fully validated and were 
considered satisfactory. Satisfactory studies were performed to assess the distribution of vinflunine in 
the  blood,  its  binding  properties  to  blood  components/plasma  proteins  and  elimination.  Metabolic 
pathways were appropriately identified, and the drug interactions studies were considered adequate.  
No healthy subject pharmacodynamic study reports were submitted. The pharmacodynamic properties 
of  vinflunine  were  studied  in  cancer  patient  populations.  The  approach  to  determine  the  optimally 
tolerated  dose  of  vinflunine  was  satisfactory  and  allowed  for  the  exploration  of  several  different 
posologies  in  numerous  patients.  Based  on  the  analysis  of  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and  clinical 
activity from the 3 dose schedules evaluated at Phase I, vinflunine treatment once every 3 weeks was 
considered optimal. The recommended dose was established at 350 mg/m² every 3 weeks. This dose 
was carried forward for further phase II evaluation. 
Posology 
28/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  recommended  posology  is  320 mg/m²  vinflunine  as  a  20minute  intravenous  infusion  every  3 
weeks. 
In  case  of    WHO/ECOG  Performance  Status  (PS)  of  1  or    of  0  and  prior  pelvic  irradiation,  the 
treatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m². In the absence of any  haematological toxicity 
during  the  first  cycle  causing  treatment  delay  or  dose  reduction,  the  dose  will  be  increased  to 
320 mg/m² every 3 weeks for the subsequent cycles.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment  
Vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  is  not  modified  in  patients  with  three  levels  of  impaired  liver  function 
(see  table  below  and  section  5.2),  however  based  on  hepatic  biologic  parameter  modifications 
following  vinflunine  administration  (gamma  glutamyl  transferases  (GGT),  transaminases,  bilirubin), 
the dose recommendations are as follows:

Renal impairment 
In the clinical studies, patients with CrCl (creatinine clearance)> 60 ml/min were included and treated 
at the recommended dose. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (40 ml/min ≤ CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min), the recommended dose is 
280 mg/m² given once every 3 weeks.  
In  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (20 ml/min ≤ CrCl < 40 ml/min)  the  recommended  dose  is 
250 mg/m² every 3 weeks. (see section 5.2). 
Elderly (> 65 years) 
In  the  clinical  studies,  103  patients  ≥ 75  years  old  and  374  patients  ≥ 65  and  < 75  years  old  were 
treated at the recommended dose of vinflunine. No significant differences in safety were observed in 
these two age groups. No specific dose recommendation is necessary in the elderly. 
Paediatric use   
Use in children – there is no relevant indication for use of Javlor in children 
Method of administration 
Javlor must be diluted prior to administration. Javlor is for single use only. 
For instructions on dilution before administration, see section 6.6 of the SPC 
Javlor MUST ONLY be administered intravenously. Intrathecal administration of Javlor may be fatal. 
Javlor  must  be  administered  by  a  20minute  intravenous  infusion  and  NOT  be  given  by  rapid 
intravenous bolus. 
Either peripheral lines or a central catheter can be used for vinflunine administration. When infused 
through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce venous irritation (see section 4.4). In case of small or 
sclerosed veins, lymphoedema, recent venipuncture at the same vein, the use of a central catheter may 
be preferred. To avoid extravasations it is important to be sure that the needle is correctly introduced 
before starting the infusion. 
In order to flush the vein, administration of Javlor concentrate for  solution for infusion should always 
be followed by at least an equal volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or of 
glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion.  
For detailed instructions on administration, see section 6.6 of the SPC. 
Recommended comedication 
In  order  to  prevent  constipation,  laxatives  and  dietary  measures  including  oral  hydration  are 
recommended  from  day  1  to  day  5  or  7  after  each  vinflunine  administration  (see  section  4.4  of  the 
SPC). 
In  addition,  the  following  concerns  were  identified  with  regards  to  the  clinical  pharmacology  data

active moieties). 
3. The applicant was requested to commit to providing the results of the ongoing drug-drug interaction 
(DDI) studies, as follow-up measures. Further discussion on the implications of the suspected DDI for 
paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  were  also  requested  by  the  CHMP,  including  additional  wording  to  the 
product  literature.  According  to  Weaver’s  algorithm  and  the  FDA  Guidance,  the  potential  DDI  risk 
when  combined  with  VFL  was  likely  for  ketoconazole,  itraconazole  and  Ritonavir,  which  may 
significantly inhibit VFL metabolism in the clinical setting. An in vitro study also suggested a possible 
DDI for paclitaxel and docetaxel. Therefore, although vinflunine is not intended for combination with 
either docetaxel or paclitaxel, the applicant amended section 4.5 of the SPC  with additional wording:  
‘ A possible interaction with paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP3 substrates) has been suggested from an in 
vitro  study  (slight  inhibition  of  vinflunine  metabolism).  No  specific  clinical  studies  of  vinflunine  in 
combination with these compounds have been carried out yet’. 
4.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  further  information  on  the  linearity  of  VFL 
pharmacokinetics (Study  L0070  98  IN  101  Q0)  over  range  of  VFL  dose  from  30  mg/m2  up  to  400 
mg/m2, by for example providing a table and its graphic representation of AUClast versus Cmax for 
different doses and adjusted to the dose 320 mg/m2. From the applicant’s responses, the PK linearity 
of VFL was investigated through different approaches and PK parameters calculations. Dose-adjusted 
PK  parameters  were  consistent  across  strata  of  doses  and  they  are  supported  by  graphical  displays. 
Furthermore, the analyses based on the empirical Bayes confirmed the results of the first evaluation of 
pooled data from early phase I studies and based on non-compartmental AUC calculations. The SPC 
was amended accordingly. 
5.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  updated  results  for  both  studies  L00070  IN  113  (patients 
with renal impairment) and L00070 IN 114 (elderly patients) as follow-up measures. 
6. The applicant was asked to comment on any plan for a paediatric development. The CHMP agreed 
that TCCU is predominantly present in adults, in fact, the incidence of bladder cancer increases with 
age; and that carcinoma of the bladder is extremely rare in children so that it was included in the list of 
class  condition  waivers  for  paediatric  requirements  by  the  PDCO.  However,  bladder  cancer  in 
adolescents  may  develop  as  a  consequence  of  alkylating-agent  chemotherapy  given  for  other 
childhood tumours or leukaemia. In its responses, the applicant will request a waiver to the EMEA for 
the  TCCU  indication,  which  will  be  evaluated  by  the  Paediatric  Committee.  However,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  the  potential  off-label  use  in  children  still  justified  a  paediatric  development  for 
relevant conditions, where there is a paediatric need. As a result of this discussion, the lack of data in 
children and adolescent was reflected in section 4.2 of SPC as follow:  ‘Use in children – there is no 
relevant indication for use of Javlor in children’. 
7.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  submit  the  final  results  of  study  BMS  CA183009  (effect  of 
ketoconazole on the VFL PK). The CHMP considered that the final results were in accordance with 
31/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  preliminary  results  of  the  interim  analysis  performed  on  10  patients.  Though  no  precise  dose 
adjustments are propose in the SPC, adequate warnings were included to discourage the concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in section 4.5 of SPC. 
8. VFL is apparently a P-glycoprotein substrate as it displays the classic MDR profile. Therefore the 
CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  discuss  the  risk  for  clinically  significant  interactions  with  P-
glycoprotein  inhibitors/inducers,  and  to  address  whether  information  on  P-glycoprotein  should  be 
added to section 4.5 of the SPC.  
The Applicant provided preclinical data to suggest that vinflunine, as with other vinca alkaloids, is a 
Pgp  substrate.  VFL  has  lower  affinity  than  either  Vincristine  or  Vinorelbine  and  inter-patient 
variability  between  an  oral  preparation  and  IV  formulation  was  minimal,  suggesting  that  clinically 
significant interactions are unlikely. However, no specific PK study on vinflunine and P-glycoprotein 
(Pgp)  were  conducted  to  rule  out  a  clinically  meaningful  interaction.  To  reflect  this  unlikely 
interaction, the following statement was included in section 4.5 of the SPC.  
“In vitro studies showed that vinflunine is a Pgp substrate as the other vinca alkaloids, but 
with a lower affinity. Therefore, risks of clinically significant interactions should be unlikely.” 
9.    In  section  4.2  it  has  been  clarified  that  there  is  no  data  in  Child  Pugh  C  patients.  However,  in 
section 4.4 and 5.2, still the term “severe hepatic impairment” refers to Child Pugh B patients, as this 
was  the  definition  used  in  the  Sponsor’s  specific  study.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this 
might be misleading, as in SPCs it is more common to use the term “severe hepatic impairment” for 
Child Pugh C patients, while Child Pugh B is denoted “moderate hepatic impairment”. Therefore, to 
clarify the information included in the SPC relative to the dosage in the hepatic impaired patients, the 
following amendments were made.  
Section 4.4: 
“Hepatic impairment 
The  recommended  dose  should  be  reduced  in  patients  with  level  2  or  3  of  hepatic  impairment  (see 
section 4.2).” 
Section 5.2 
“Pharmacokinetic in special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No  modification  of  vinflunine  and  DVFL  pharmacokinetics  was  observed  in  25  patients  presenting 
varying  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment,  compared  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function.  This  is 
further  confirmed  by  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (absence  of  relationship  between 
vinflunine  clearance  and  biology  markers  of  hepatic  impairment)  However,  dose  adjustments  are 
recommended in patients with level 2 or 3 liver impairment (see section 4.2).” 
Section 4.2: 
“Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  is  not  modified  in  patients  with  three  levels  of  impaired  liver  function 
(see  table  below  and  section  5.2),  but  mainly  based  on  hepatic  biologic  parameter  modifications 
(gamma  glutamyl  transferases  (GGT),  transaminases,  bilirubin),  the  dose  recommendations  are  as 
follows: 
Table 2. Dose adjustments due to hepatic impairment 
32/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vinflunine  was  evaluated  neither  in  patients  with  Child-Pugh  grade  C,  nor  in  patients  with 
prothrombine  time  <  50%  NV  or  with  bilirubin  >  5xULN  or  with  transaminases  >  6xULN  or  with 
Gamma Glutamyl Transferases (GGT)> 15xULN.” 
Clinical efficacy  
The clinical development programme for vinflunine in second-line treatment in patients with TCCU 
after platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens included 3 phase I trials (VFL 981, 991 and 992), 2 
phase II studies (VFL 202 and CA001) and 1 randomised Phase III study (VFL 302). The table below 
summarises the phase II/III studies. 
Table 18. Summary of Phase II/III studies 
•  Dose response study(ies) 
Three  phase  I  trials  with  vinflunine  monotherapy  have  been  conducted  exploring  3  different 
administration  schedules:  (1)  day  1  every  3  weeks,  2)  day  1  every  week,  and  3)  days  1&8  every  3 
weeks.  Based  on  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and  clinical  activity,  the  schedule  of  vinflunine 
administered on day 1 every 3 weeks was selected for further clinical development (VFL 981). Dose 
limiting  toxicities  were  neutropenia,  constipation  and  mucositis  and  the  recommended  dose  for  this 
schedule  was  350  mg/m2  iv  q3w.  A  strong  correlation  between  vinflunine  AUC  and  maximum 
neutrophil  count  decrease  from  baseline  were  demonstrated.  Preliminary  evidence  of  antineoplastic 
activity was documented (tumour responses were observed in 1 renal and 2 breast cancer patients).

Starting in October 2000, an international program of Phase II studies with vinflunine as a single agent 
was undertaken in a wide range of solid tumours. In these early studies, vinflunine was administered at 
a  dose  of  350 mg/m²  every  3  weeks  according  to  the  phase  I  clinical  trial  recommendation.  A 
preliminary safety analysis performed after the enrolment of 60 patients in different trials, however, 
showed  an  exceedingly  high  rate  of  myelotoxicity  (64%  of  patients  had  Grade  3/4  events,  15% 
developed febrile neutropenia). Twenty-two patients (36.6%) out of the 60 patients who were exposed 
to 350 mg/m², experienced at least 1 study treatment related SAE, including 4 (6.7%) study treatment 
related  deaths  within  the  30  days  following  the  last  vinflunine  administration.  These  findings 
prompted  a  reduction  of  the  recommended  dose  to  320  mg/m²  every  3  weeks  for  all  patients 
subsequently  included  in  clinical  trials.  This  dose  recommendation  was  later  further  reduced  to  280 
mg/m2 in patients at higher risk of myelosuppression (PS > 1, prior pelvic radiotherapy).

Centres from the following countries participated in the trial: Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, 
Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Italy,  Netherlands,  Norway,  Poland, 
Russia, Serbia Montenegro, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom 
Treatments 
The study had two treatment arms: vinflunine (VFL) and Best Standard of Care (BSC) or BSC alone. 
In the vinflunine + BSC group, treatment was administered until documented progression. All lesions 
were regularly assessed every 42 days. In the BSC group, visits were recorded until completion of the 
18-week. 
Arm A – vinflunine + BSC  
VFL was administered every 21 days as a 20-minute infusion. Each 21-day period was defined as a 
cycle of treatment. There were 2 different starting doses of VFL used in this study tailored according 
to the patient: 320 mg/m² and 280 mg/m².Treatment was discontinued following progressive disease, 
unacceptable  toxicity,  intercurrent  illness  or  other  reactions  which  would  require  discontinuation  of 
the drug and request by the patient to withdraw. The follow-up period was the time from 30 days after 
the last study treatment administration. 
Arm B – BSC 
BSC  was  given  according  to  institutional  standards  (including  palliative  radiotherapy,  antibiotics, 
analgesics,  steroids,  transfusion).  Treatment  was  discontinued  following  completion  of  the  18-week 
period  counting  from  the  day  of  randomisation,  receiving  a  systemic  anticancer  therapy  due  to 
documented progressive disease compared to baseline, request by the patient to withdraw and patient 
inability to meet the every 3-week schedule. 
Patient accrual was planned to be completed within 24 months from the beginning of the study (May 
21st 2003). The study duration phase was planned to continue until the last patients withdrew from the 
treatment  (November  6th  2006)  After  withdrawal  from  the  study  treatment,  each  patient  will  be 
followed until death. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare overall survival (defined as the interval between randomisation 
and  death  or  last  follow  up)  in  patients  with  advanced  TCCU  previously  treated  with  a  platinum-
containing chemotherapy as first line treatment. The main objective was to show survival superiority 
in the vinflunine arm compared to best supportive care (BSC) alone, based on the statistical hypothesis 
that the median survival time for the vinflunine + BSC arm would be 6 months compared to a median 
survival time for the BSC only patients of 4 months. 
The secondary objectives were : 
- to compare patient benefit through a quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and clinical 
benefit parameters. 
36/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- to compare the safety profile in both study arms 
- to assess response rate, time to response, response duration and progression-free survival in patients 
treated with vinflunine +BSC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free 
survival, response rate, disease control/rate, quality of life and clinical benefit. 
Sample size 
A  total  of  330  randomised  evaluable  patients  were  enrolled.  The  vinflunine  +  BSC  arm  had  220 
randomised  evaluable  patients  and  the  BSC  only  arm  had  110  randomised  evaluable  patients.  To 
accommodate  an  anticipated  10%  loss  of  patients  to  follow-up,  364  patients  should  have  been 
included. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 2:1 to vinflunine + BSC or BSC alone. Patient randomisation was limited to 
stratification  by  study  site  and  whether  a  patient  was  refractory  to  prior  chemotherapy  (defined  as 
progression  within  the  first  2  cycles  of  a  prior  platinum-containing  regimen).  Randomisation  was 
performed by the Biometric department of IRPF. 
Blinding (masking) 
The phase III study was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
The objective of the protocol was to show a significant survival superiority in the vinflunine + BSC 
arm versus the BSC only arm. The sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy parameter included: 
- overall survival analysed in the per protocol population.  
-  overall  survival  censored  at  the  time  (start  date)  of  further  chemotherapy  in  the  randomised 
population and in the statistical analysis plan per protocol population. 
For patients who had not died, survival duration was censored at the date of last news if the patient 
was  lost  to  follow-up  or  reached  the  time  point  of  analysis  without  a  known  record  of  death.  For 
patients who received secondary chemotherapy, survival duration was censored at the start date of the 
secondary chemotherapy. 
The estimation of the number of events was based on the following clinical hypotheses: 
- the median survival time for vinflunine + BSC arm is 6 months. 
- the median survival time for  BSC arm is 4 months. 
A  total  of  290  events  were  assumed  to  be  needed  to  allow  the  detection  of  a  survival  superiority 
between both arms. The primary analysis was based upon the stratified log rank test performed at 0.05 
level.  The  primary  analysis  set  was  the  intent  to  treat  population.  A  Cox  multivariate  analysis  on 
survival  was  performed  in  order  to  take  into  account  prognostic  factors  (treatment  group,  alkaline 
phosphatase (< median, ≥ median), haemoglobin (< median, ≥ median), visceral metastases (yes, no), 
WHO  PS  (0,  ≥1),  radiotherapy  of  the  pelvis  (yes,  no),  and  the  presence  of  lymph  nodes  (yes,  no)). 
Survival information was collected approximately every 6 weeks during the first 6 months and then 
every 2 months until death.  
Secondary objectives were to compare patient benefit through a quality of life questionnaire (EORTC 
QLQ-C30)  and  clinical  benefit  parameters, to  compare  the  safety  profile in  both  arms  and to  assess 
response  rate  (according  to  RECIST,  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC)  reviewed  tumour 
assessments with CR and PR), time to response, response duration and progression free survival.  
37/89 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical  methods  for  categorical  variables:  the  x2  test  was  performed  to  compare  proportions  or 
replaced by Fisher exact test if the expected frequency in one cell of the contingency table was less 
than 5. The 95% CI for proportions was computing following the exact method. 
Statistical method for ordinal variables: comparison between treatment arms was provided for ordinal 
data using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
Statistical method for continuous variables: the distribution of quantitative data was examined by the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test  in  order  to  test  for  normality.  In  case  of  Gaussian  distribution,  the 
comparison  between  treatment  arms  was  made  with  a  Student  t-test.  In  case  of  non-Gaussian 
distribution, a non-parametric Wilcoxon test was performed. 
Statistical methods for time to event data: Kaplan-Meier curves and life tables by treatment arm were 
used  to  describe  time  dependent  paramenters.  Confidence  intervals  on  the  median  were  calculated 
using  the  reflection  method.  Stratified  Logrank  tests  were  performed  to  compare  the  two  arms  for 
overall survival. Multivariate analyses were performed to take into account the prognostic factors. A 
stratified Cox proportional hazard model was applied to the data. 
Statistical methods for Quality of Life data: data was analysed with a mixed effect model with change 
from  baseline  as  the  response.  The  most  suitable  covariance  structure  was  chosen  according  to 
Akaike’s  Information  Criterion  and  Schwartz  Bayesian  Criterion  between  unstructured,  compound 
symmetric and autoregressive of order 1. 
Populations analysed 
1.  Intent to treat population: all randomised patients whether treated or not were analysed in the 
group they were assigned by randomization. 
2.  Per  protocol  population:  patients  that  were  eligible  and  treated  in  the  arm  assigned  by 
randomization. 
Eligible patients were defined as those who had no major protocol deviations from inclusion 
and  exclusion  criteria.  These  included  the  following:  1)  no  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
histologically proven TCC at study entry, 2) no progression after 1st line platinum-containing 
chemotherapy  for  advanced  disease,  3)  having  received  a  neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant 
chemotherapy,  4)  more  than  1  line  of  chemotherapy,  and  5)  did  not  have  a  prohibited 
chemotherapy on study. 
3.  Evaluable for response: patients that were eligible, evaluable and treated in the arm assigned 
by randomization.  
To be evaluable for response patients must had received a minimum of two cycles/42 days of 
treatment as required by the protocol unless progression was documented before (in that case 
patient was considered evaluable with an early progression) and must have all baseline lesions 
assessed  at  least  once  after  the  second  cycle  with  the  same  method  of  measurement  as 
baseline. 
4.  Evaluable for safety: included all treated patients, in the treatment arm they actually received. 
5.  Evaluable  for  quality  of  life:  included  patients  who  completed  (more  than  two  thirds  of  the 
questions)  one  questionnaire  within  14  days  prior  to  randomisation  and  at  least  one 
questionnaire  during  study  period  at  least  21  days  after  the  beginning  of  study  treatment  or 
first visit for patients in BSC group. Patients were analysed in the group they were assigned by 
randomisation. 
Efficacy Analysis 
38/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses for overall survival were performed on the whole randomised 
population and on the pre-planned per protocol populations. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses 
for  the  other  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  on  the  whole  randomised  population  and  on  the 
response evaluable population. 
Additional efficacy analysis were performed based on blinded assessment by an Independent Review 
Panel  (IRP)  of  patients  with  partial  or  complete  responses  or  long  stabilizations  (lasting  at  least  4 
cycles). Also, an Independent Review Committee (IRC) evaluated study-related images and a subset 
of selected, prospectively defined clinical information for all patients who were randomized.

Recruitment 
The date of first enrolment was 21st May 2003. The study data cut off was 30th November 2006 with a 
final data update on the 31st of May, 2007. 
Conduct of the study 
A  total  of  8  protocol  amendments  were  carried  out.  Of  importance,  on  May  21st  2003,  all  patients 
randomised to vinflunine + BSC were treated at 320 mg/m² every 21 days as a 20-minute infusion. On 
November  19th  2003,  an  amendment  (amendment  1)  was  drawn  up  after  a  safety  assessment  was 
carried out on the first 10 treated patients. This amendment led to a tailored vinflunine administration 
as follows: 
•  Patients  with  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)/World  Health  Organization 
(WHO)  Performance  Status  (PS)  0  and  without  any  previous  irradiation  of  the  pelvic  area 
should receive VFL 320 mg/m² plus BSC 
Patients with PS 1 and patients with PS 0 with previous irradiation of the pelvic area should 
receive VFL as follows: 
• 
At 1st cycle: VFL 280 mg/m² plus BSC 
At  2nd  cycle:  patients  without  haematological  toxicities  causing  treatment  delay 
should start VFL at 320 mg/m² plus BSC.  
•  Patients with haematological toxicities causing a treatment delay should receive VFL at 280 
mg/m² plus BSC. These patients were not allowed to further dose escalate. 
Thirty one protocol deviations were established, among these items 4 were considered as significant 
protocol deviations. A total of 116 (31%) patients had 1 or more protocol deviations: 73 (29%) in the 
VFL+BSC  group  and  43  (37%)  in  the  BSC  group.  The  116  patients  collectively  had  26  of  the  31 
major protocol deviations that were pre-specified. Nine percent of bone scintigraphy and X-rays were 
not performed within 42 days before randomisation. The performance of bone scanning was the most 
common major protocol deviation (9% in both groups).

Numbers analysed 
ITT 
Efficacy  analyses  for  overall  survival  were  performed  on  the  whole  randomised  population  (n=370, 
100%),  on  the  eligible  population  (n=357,  96.5%)  and  on  the  pre-planned  per  protocol  population 
(n=351). Other efficacy analysis were performed on the whole randomised population (n=370, 100%) 
and on the response evaluable population (n=270, 72.9%). 
The table below summarizes the number of participants in each group included in the analysis.

Table 21. Study VFL 302. Participants by category 
Eligible patients 
The  eligible  patient  population  corresponds  to  the  whole  randomised  population  minus  ineligible 
patients,  those  with  clinically  significant  protocol  violations  at  baseline  (i.e.  violating  the  inclusion 
criteria).  The  eligible  patient  population  represents  the  actual  TCCU  population  targeted  by  the 
protocol  (all  randomised  patients  excluding  non  eligible  patients:  VFL+BSC:  4  patients,  BSC:  9 
patients: not pre-specified in the protocol). 
Non-Eligible patients 
Per protocol 
Per  protocol  population  corresponds  to  the  randomised  population  minus  non  eligible  patients.    Per 
protocol  population  excludes  13  patients  who  had  1  or  more  significant  deviations  at  baseline, 
deviations  during  the  study  and  non-treated  patients.  Per  protocol  population  (according  to  the 
statistical analysis plan was 244 subjects in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 107 subjects in the BSC. 
This population corresponds to all those randomised patients except: 
•  Deviations to the protocol at baseline (13 patients) 
•  Deviations to the protocol during study (1 patient) 
•  The non-treated patients (5 patients) 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
Overall Survival (OS) All randomised patients  
81% patients died in the vinflunine and BSC and 88% patients died in the BSC only arm. Median OS 
for all randomised patients was 6.9 months in the vinflunine arm and 4.6 months in the BSC arm. The 
risk of death is reduced by 12% in the vinflunine + BSC arm compared to the BSC arm: HR of 0.88 
(95%  CI:  0.69  -  1.12),  but  the  OS  difference  between  the  2  arms  is  not  statistically  significant 
(p=0.2868).  
Overall survival data was updated 6 months after the first analysis in November, 2006. OS in the all 
randomised population showed a 2 months advantage favouring vinflunine + BSC (6.9 month versus 
42/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.6 months),  with a reduction of risk of death by 12%, HR 0.88 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.10). This difference 
is not statistically significant (p = 0.2546). 
Figure 2. Overall Survival: All Randomised Patients 
Overall Survival (OS) - Per protocol population 
Median OS for per protocol analysis was 6.9 months in the vinflunine arm and 4.3 months in the BSC 
arm. The risk of death is reduced by 25% in the vinflunine + BSC arm compared to the BSC arm: HR 
of  0.75  (95%  CI:  0.59;  0.96  p=0.0197).    In  a  subsequent  update,  OS  in  the  per  protocol  patient 
population showed a 2 months advantage favouring vinflunine + BSC (6.9 month versus 4.3 months), 
with  a  reduction  of  risk  of  death  by  26%  HR  0.74  (95%  CI:  0.59,  0.94).  This  difference  was 
statistically significant (p = 0.0130).

Figure 3. Overall survival: Per protocol population 
Overall Survival (OS) - Eligible patients 
Median OS in the eligible population was 6.9 months in the vinflunine arm and 4.3 months in the BSC 
arm. The risk of death is reduced by 22% in the vinflunine + BSC arm compared to the BSC arm: HR 
of  0.78  (95%CI:  0.61,  0.99  p=0.0403).  The  OS  difference  between  the  2  arms  is  now  statistically 
significant.  
In a subsequent analysis, OS in the eligible patient population showed a 2 months advantage favouring 
vinflunine + BSC (6.9 month versus 4.3 months), with a reduction of risk of death by 23% HR 0.77 
(95% CI: 0.61, 0.98). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0320).

The overall survival updated on November 30th 2008 still confirmed the previous reported data of 2 
months median survival advantage favouring VFL+BSC with a reduction of risk of death of 22%  [HR 
(95% CI): 0.78 (0.61-0.96)], this difference being statistically significant (p=0.0227)

Tumour Response rate 
The  IRC  evaluated  study-related  images  and  a  subset  of  selected,  prospectively  defined  clinical 
information  for  all  patients  who  were  randomised.  The  reviewers  conducted  response  determination 
using RECIST for each patient. The on-study best overall response was calculated to 30th November, 
2006 and to 31st May, 2007. IRC information was also used to compare the response rate, to compare 
disease control rate, duration of response, time to response and duration of disease control. 
The response rate (RR) in all 253 randomised patients, as assessed by IRC was 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7 - 
10.1)  and  the  RR  as  assessed  by  investigators  was  11.1%  (95%  CI:  7.5  -  15.6).  Based  on  IRC 
assessment, the response rate in evaluable patients was 8.6% (95% CI: 5.0 - 13.7) in the vinflunine + 
BSC  and  0%  in  the  BSC  arms.  The  median  time  from  randomisation  to  first  response  in  the 
randomised  population  for  the  vinflunine  +  BSC  group  was  2.1  months  and  the  median  duration  of 
response was 7.4 months. The median duration of stabilisation in the randomised population was 5.4 
months in the vinflunine + BSC group and 4.2 months in the BSC group.

Disease Control/Rate (DC/R) 
Disease control is defined as: DC = PR + SD. Based on IRC assessment, the disease control rate for all 
randomised patients was 41.1% in the vinflunine + BSC group versus 24.8% in the BSC group [p = 
0.0024]. Duration of DC, in all randomised patients was 5.7 months in the vinflunine + BSC group 
versus 4.2 months in the BSC only arm. The disease control rate in evaluable patients was 55.1% in 
the vinflunine + BSC group versus 27.1% in the BSC group [p < 0.0001].

Quality of life  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 was completed at baseline, at the end of cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 for the vinflunine 
+ BSC arm and at baseline, Days 21, 42, 84 and 126 for the BSC arm. Compliance at baseline was 
91.3% in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 90.6% in the BSC arm. Compliance at the end of cycle 6/Day 
126 was 58.4% in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 53.7% in the BSC arm. There was no statistically 
significant  difference  between  the  groups  in  change  from  baseline  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global 
health status score (p=0.658). 
Clinical Benefit 
The  clinical  benefit  parameter  is  a  composite  endpoint  taking  into  account  the  following  clinical 
parameters assessed at the time of randomisation and every cycle/21 days: PS (WHO Scale), weight 
and pain intensity (measured by the McGill-Merlzack Pain Questionnaire) and incidence of palliative 
radiotherapy. 
The clinical benefit response rate in the evaluable population was 9.4% in the vinflunine + BSC arm 
and 7.6% in the BSC arm (p = 0.6066).  There was no statistically significant difference between the 
two arms in terms of clinical benefit response rate. 
Palliative Radiotherapy  
Administration of at least one course of palliative radiotherapy was statistically significantly higher in 
the BSC arm (23.9%) compared to the vinflunine + BSC arm (4.0%). 
Ancillary analyses 
Multivariate Analysis of OS using a Cox proportional hazard model 
Baseline  patient  characteristics  were  imbalanced  between  the  2  treatment  arms  for  WHO  PS  ≥  1 
(vinflunine + BSC arm (71.5%) BSC arm (61.5%). The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
were  performed  on  the  whole  randomised  population,  using  the  Cox  proportional  hazard  model 
adjusted for the stepwise selected covariates pre-specified in the protocol and the Statistical Analysis 
Plan  (treatment  group,  alkaline  phosphatase,  haemoglobin,  visceral  metastases,  ECOG  Performance 
Status, and pelvic irradiation). In the multivariate analysis of OS, including pre-specified prognostic 
factors,  Performance  Status  (PS  0  versus  1)  was  the most  important  prognostic factor  with a  HR  of 
50/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.48  (p<0.0001).  Based  on  the  results  of  this  model,  vinflunine  reduced  the  risk  of  death  by  23% 
compared with BSC only, with a hazard ratio HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61 - 0.98, p = 0.0360).  
Table  24:  Multivariate  Analysis  of  Overall  Survival  Using  a  Cox  Proportional  Hazard  Model:  All 
Randomised Patients 
An additional multivariate analysis of overall survival using a Cox proportional hazard model was also 
conducted in the eligible (modified ITT) population and showed a statistically significant effect of the 
treatment arm on survival (p=0.0027) (see table below).

b: Wald Chi square test 
The  results  observed  in  the  ITT  population  were  confirmed  by  those  observed  in  the  eligible  
population. 
The  Cox  model  proportional  hazards  assumption  was  investigated  with  the  test  of  Grambsch  and 
Therneau  as  performed  for  the  Cox  model  in  the  ITT  population.  The  global  test  did  not  show  a 
deviance  from  the  proportional  hazards  assumption  (p=0.273).  Taken  individually,  only  the 
Performance  Status  showed  evidence  of  deviation  from  the  proportional  hazards  assumption 
(p=0.028).  Thus,  the  Cox  model  was  performed  stratifying  by  Performance  Status.  The  results  are 
given in the table below.

b: Wald Chi square test 
The  proportional  hazards  assumption  was  tested  in  the  model  stratified  on  the  PS,  and  neither  the 
global  test  (p=0.731)  nor  the  individual  tests  (all  p-values  above  0.05)  showed  a  deviance  from  the 
assumption. 
No  effect  of  prior  cisplatin  (p=0.4626)  nor  interaction  with  the  treatment  group  (p=0.5825)  can  be 
evidenced with the multivariate Cox analysis (Table 27) leading to the conclusion that the multivariate 
model  to  be  analyzed  in  the  eligible  population  is  the  one  without  the  cisplatin  covariate.  In  this 
analysis  (Table  28),  it is  found  that VFL improves  significantly  the  Overall  Survival  of the  patients 
(HR: 0.686 (0.536, 0.877), p-value: 0. 0027).

No effect of prior cisplatin (p=0.8039) and no interaction between treatment group and prior cisplatin 
(p=0.9716). The pre-specified multivariate Cox model in the eligible population was used in order to 
adjust  the  effect  of  the  treatment  group  on  the  prognostic  factors  when  analyzing  the  PFS.  In  this 
model, the effect of the treatment group is found to be significant (p=0.0001).

•  Clinical studies in special populations 
Renal Impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in cancer patients with renal impairment was conducted and 
is still ongoing (CSR L0070 IN 113 interim). The trial is an open-label, non-randomised, multicentre 
PK Phase I study in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. The primary objective of the 
study  was  to  investigate the  effect  of  renal  impairment  on  the  PK  of  vinflunine  and  DVFL  in  adult 
cancer  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  dysfunction  and,  to  propose  a  dose  adjustment  when 
required. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety of vinflunine. The results of the interim 
analysis  suggested  that  Clcr  of  vinflunine  was  decreased  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  The 
decrease was of approximately 16% in patients with moderate renal impairment and of approximately 
30%  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  Renal  impairment  affected  the  elimination  of  both 
vinflunine and DVFL to a similar extent. 
Hepatic Impairment 
A  phase  I  pharmacokinetic  dose  adjusted  of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  liver  dysfunction 
was  conducted  during  the  drug  development  (CSR  L0070  IN  104).  The  study  was  an  open-label 
multicentre  phase  I  study.  The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  Recommended 
Dose  (RD)  of  vinflunine  and  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics  and  tolerability  of  vinflunine  in 
cancer  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  hepatic  dysfunction.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to 
recommend dose adjustments of vinflunine if needed.  
For pharmacokinetic analysis, no statistical difference was evidenced for VFL and DVFL among the 3 
groups of liver impairment and between liver impairment groups and the control group (n= 49). No 
significant correlation was observed between individual values of VFL clearance and each biological 
variables at baseline (i.e bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT, total plasma protein and prothrombine 
time) and between VFL clearance and the presence or absence of cirrhosis.  
The liver impairment (LI) effect was also studied in the population PK analysis (372 patients including 
LI  patients  data)  which  showed  that  covariates  such  as  total  bilirubin,  transaminases  and  alkaline 
phosphatase were not related to VFL Cltot. Likewise, the population PK approach did not show any 
modification of VFL Cltot in patients with liver metastases (n= 141 patients out of 372).

A  pharmacokinetic  study  of  IV  vinflunine  in  elderly  cancer  patients  (L00070  IN  114)  started  in 
January 2005 and is still ongoing. 
•  Supportive study(ies) 
Phase II study - VFL 202 
This was an open-label, multi-centre (18 centres in 5 European countries), single-arm non-randomised 
Phase  II  study  of  vinflunine.  Patients  with  TCCU  who  had  relapsed  after  a  previous  platinum-
containing regimen were enrolled. The study was carried out between November 2000 and September 
2002. The primary objective was to estimate the response rate according to modified WHO criteria. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  duration  of  response,  progression  free  survival  and  overall 
survival  and  to  evaluate  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  toxicities  associated  with  the  treatment.  An 
independent  radiologist  reviewed  all  the  responses  and  disease  stabilisations  lasting  at  least  2 
consecutive assessments. Tumour assessment was performed every two cycles. Subjects included Men 
or  women  >  18  years,  who  had  histologically  proven  advanced  TCCU  of  the  bladder,  with 
documented relapse or progression after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy and KPS > 80. 
The  median  age  of  patients  treated  with  350  mg/m²  group  was  66  and  the  median  age  of  patients 
treated with 320 mg/m² group was 63. Previous first-line chemotherapy included cisplatin-vinblastine 
(43%)  and  gemcitabine  /platinum  (49%).  51%  of  patients  had  progressed  within  6  months  of  their 
prior chemotherapy. 
Vinflunine  was  administered  as  a  10-minute  infusion  at  350  mg/m²  every  3  weeks  for  the  first  6 
patients.  For  the  51  subsequent  patients,  vinflunine  was  administered  at  320  mg/m²  every  3  weeks 
following  preliminary  safety  evaluation.  The  treatment  was  discontinued  in  case  of  progressive 
disease,  unacceptable  toxicity,  intercurrent  illness  or  other  reactions  which  in  the  judgement  of  the 
investigator, affected clinical status of the patient or request by the patient to withdraw. 
51  patients  were  treated  at  320  mg/m²,  Day  1  every  three  weeks.  Out  of  47  evaluable  patients,  the 
overall  response  rate  was  17.6%  (95%  CI:  7.7-30.8%)  as  assessed  by  independent  review  and  the 
median duration of the response was 9.1 months, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 4.2 to 
15.0  months.  The  median  progression-free  survival  calculated  was  3  months  [95%  CI:  2.4-3.8 
months], while the median overall survival was 6.6 months [95% CI: 4.8-7.6 months]    
Safety  conclusions  refer  solely  to  the  patients  treated  at  the  dose  of  320  mg/m².  In  terms  of  drug 
exposure,  the  relative  dose  intensity  was  95.5%  [range:  71.0  -  102.3%].  The  majority  of  dose 
reductions were due to non-haematological toxicities (280 mg/m² [9.6%]). Neutropenia was reported 
in 82.4% of patients with grade 3-4 severity in 66.7%. The neutrophil nadir appeared at a median day 
12 [range: 3-21] and lasted a median of 7 days [range: 1-14]. Grade 3 and 4 febrile neutropenia were 
observed in 7.8% and 2.0% of patients. Three cases of septicaemia/severe neutropenia occurred, with a 
fatal  outcome  for  2  patients.  The  overall  incidence  of  anaemia  was  in  90.2%  of  patients.  Grade  3 
anaemia occurred in 13.7% of patients (5.1% of cycles). A significant percentage of patients (66.7%) 
experienced fatigue of mild intensity. Grade 3 fatigue occurred in 9.8% of patients (3.0% of cycles) 
with  no  grade  4  fatigue  being  observed.    Constipation  appeared  to  be  the  most  important  non-
haematological  toxicity  seen,  with  an  overall  incidence  of  64.7%  of  patients.  Four  patients  (7.9%) 
experienced  severe  (grade  3/4)  constipation.  All  four  patients  had  undergone  significant  prior 
abdominal  surgery;  three  also  received  opioids  +  5HT3  antagonists.  Constipation  was  notified  as  a 
SAE  in  7  patients.  Grade  3  toxicities  included  neutropenia  (33.3%),  anaemia  (16.7%),  nausea  and 
vomiting  (16.7%).  Grade  4  toxicities  included  leucopenia  (50.0%),  neutropenia  (66.7%),  anaemia 
(16.7%),  one  patients  experienced  a  fatal  febrile  neutropenia,  and  three  patients  died  due  to  SAE 
(septic shock, septicaemia febrile neutropenia).  
Phase II study CA 001 
This was an open-label, multi-centre (60 centres in 12 countries), single-arm, non-randomised Phase II 
study  of  vinflunine.  Patients  with  TCCU  who  had  relapsed  after  a  previous  platinum-containing 
regimen were enrolled. The Study was carried out between the 27th January 2005 and the 10th April 
54/89 
 
 
 
 
 
      
 
2007.  The  primary  objective  was  to  estimate  the  response  rate  (complete  response  [CR]  +  partial 
response  [PR];  as  defined  by  modified  WHO  criteria  and  determined  by  an  Independent  Response 
Review Committee (IRRC). Tumour assessment was performed every 6 weeks. Secondary objectives 
included estimation of the duration of response, time to response, disease control rate, progression free 
survival  (PFS),  and  overall  survival  (OS)  and  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  vinflunine  and 
vinflunine  pharmacokinetics.  Inclusion  criteria  included  men  and  women  >  age  18  years  who  had 
histologically  proven  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  TCCU,  had  documented  progression  up  to  12 
months after the last dose of a platinum-containing regimen, and KPS of 100, 90 or 80. The median 
age was 66 years (range: 31 to 83 years). 
Vinflunine was administered every 21 days; prior to Amendment 5, patients received vinflunine at a 
dose  of  320  mg/m²  every  3  weeks  if  they  had  a  KPS  of  100  without  prior  pelvic  irradiation.  Upon 
implementation  of  Amendment  5,  patients  also  needed  to  be  <  75  years  old  and  have  a  CrCl  >  60 
mL/min to receive vinflunine at a starting dose of 320 mg/m². Patients received vinflunine at an initial 
dose of 280 mg/m² if they had a KPS of 90 or 80 
Among  the  175  patients  enrolled,  151  were  treated  with  the  study  medication.  In  the  All-Treated 
population, the primary endpoint of independently assessed response rate was 14.6% [95% CI: 9.4 - 
21.2]. Duration of tumour responses was a median of 5.95 months (95% CI: 5.42 - 9.46). Median PFS 
was 2.76 (95% CI: 2.56 - 3.84) and median OS was 7.89 months (95% CI: 6.67 - 9.69) 
The  most  frequent  adverse  events  noted  were  myelosuppression,  constipation  and  fatigue. 
Myelosuppression  was  common.  Severe  (Grade  3-4)  events  of  neutropenia  and  leukopenia  were 
reported  in  more  than  half  of  all  patients.  Febrile  neutropenia  was  uncommon  (6.6%).  The  most 
common  non-haematologic  AEs  were  constipation,  followed  by  fatigue,  nausea,  weight  decrease, 
anorexia, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, alopecia, and back pain. The most common (> 10%) 
non-haematologic  severe  (Grade  3-4)  AEs  were  constipation  and  fatigue.  The  frequency  of 
discontinuation  due  to  treatment  related  AEs  was  15%. The  incidence of  peripheral  neuropathy  was 
low and only 1 Grade 3 event was reported. Other AEs of special interest (ileus, intestinal obstruction, 
abdominal  pain,  injection/infusion  site  reactions,  immediate  hypersensitivity,  extravastion,  cardiac 
arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, infection with severe neutropenia, and diarrhoea) 
were manageable, though a few of these AEs led to discontinuation. 86 (57%) patients died after the 
study started, 10 of these (7%) died within 30 days of their last vinflunine dose. 2 patients (1%) died 
due to events judged to be related to the study drug (neutropenic sepsis, myocardial infarction).  
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  were  considered  to  be  consistent  and  the  efficacy  endpoint  of  overall 
survival  was  considered  to  be  significantly  different  between  the  two  treatment  groups,  based  on  a 
consistent  picture  across  a  number  of  secondary  analyses  including  the  eligible  population  analysis 
and following adjustment for covariates. Secondary endpoints, particularly progression-free survival, 
favoured  the  vinflunine  arm,  supporting  the  conclusion  that  the  product  is  efficacious.  The  effects 
were  consistent  across  subgroups.  The  updated  overall  survival  data,  at  two  years  confirmed  the 
positive  treatment  effect  of  vinflunine  on  overall  survival  as  reported  at  the  first  cut-off  date  (Nov 
30th, 2006).  
With  regards  to  potential  interactions  between  treatment  effect  and  prior  cisplatin  therapy  in  the 
eligible population, the results were better in those patients without prior cisplatin therapy, but there 
was  still  evidence  of  efficacy  in  the  group  of  patients  who  had  received  prior  cisplatin  therapy.  A 
favourable trend  was  observed  with the  log-rank  test and  when  covariates  were adjusted  in  the  Cox 
regression model, the difference reached statistical significance in both subgroups. 
The following major objections were raised regarding the clinical efficacy data submitted. 
1.  The CHMP was initially of the opinion that insufficient evidence for efficacy of Vinfluinine had 
been  provided.  The  primary  analysis  from  the  single  pivotal  study  had  failed  to  show  a  statistical 
significant difference in overall survival for vinflunine when compared to BSC in the ITT (intention to 
55/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treat) population. A difference in overall survival was only observed in secondary analyses, excluding 
patients from the ITT population. The need to exclude a substantial proportion of subjects from the per 
protocol analysis cast some doubt on the overall validity of the trial. Potential biases arising from these 
specific exclusions, needed to be addressed. 
In  the  dossier  submitted,  the  eligible  population  corresponds  to  the  whole  randomised  population 
minus  the  ineligible  patients.  The  Applicant  argued  that  the  eligible  patients  represent  the  actual 
TCCU population targeted by the protocol. In the eligible population, a median of 2 months survival 
advantage  favouring  the  VFL+BSC  arm  was  observed  (6.9  months  vs.  4.3  months).  A  statistically 
significant  (stratified  log-rank  test)  survival  difference  between  the  2  arms  was  achieved  (HR  0.78 
[0.61, 0.99] p=0.0403). In this analysis, where patients with clinically significant protocol violations at 
baseline  (i.e.  those  violating  the  inclusion  criteria)  were  excluded,  the  results  did  achieve  statistical 
significance.  
The primary analysis performed in the ITT population was affected by the higher proportion of non 
eligible patients in the BSC arm (9 non eligible patients for BSC vs. 4 for VFL + BSC).  Ineligible 
patients  included  patients  with  no  progression  to  first  line  platinum-containing  chemotherapy  for 
advanced  disease  (12  out  of  13  patients)  or  patients  with  no  advanced  or  metastatic  histologically 
proven TCCU.  This is consistent with the longer survival observed in these patients.  Importantly, non 
eligible  patients  were  identified  using  a  blinded  review  before  database  lock,  and  all  analyses  were 
performed  after  the  database  lock  (30th  March  2007).    These  patients  are  not  representative  of  the 
population  targeted  by  the  protocol  (advanced  TCCU  that  has  failed  prior  platinum-containing 
regimen).  
Furthermore,  a  significant  treatment  effect  of  vinflunine  (p=0.036)  on  overall  survival  in  the  pre-
specified multivariate Cox analysis conducted in the ITT population was seen. Vinflunine reduced the 
risk of death by 23% compared to BSC with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61-0.98).  In addition, 
the  fact  that  all  other  parameters  that  had  a  significant  independent  impact  on  OS  in  multivariate 
analysis  (liver involvement,  number  of  organs involved,  alkaline phosphatase, haemoglobin,  PS  and 
pelvic  irradiation)  were  the  same  in  the  three  populations  analysed  (ITT,  eligible  and  Per-Protocol) 
further supports the consistency of the results. 
Therefore the CHMP considered that: 
a. The primary analysis from the single pivotal study failed to show a statistical significant difference 
in overall survival for vinflunine when compared to BSC in the ITT population.  
b. A statistically significant effect on overall survival was obtained from the pre-specified multivariate 
Cox analysis. The hazard ratio from this analysis was 0.77 (0.61, 0.98), very consistent with the 0.78 
(0.61, 0.99) obtained from the eligible population analysis. At the request of the CHMP, the Applicant 
repeated  the  analysis  stratifying  for  Performance  Status  and  thereby  not  relying  on  proportional 
hazards for this covariate. The results were consistent with those previously observed - ITT population 
(p=0.0420, HR 0.776 (0.61, 0.99)); eligible population (p=0.0067, HR=0.708 (0.55, 0.91)). 
2. The Applicant was also asked to present efficacy results in relation to prior platinum based therapy. 
Based on the evidence provided,  the results were better in the ‘without prior cisplatin therapy group’, 
although evidence of efficacy was still seen in the ‘prior cisplatin group’. None of the prior platinum 
regimens  received  by  the  patients  appeared  to  have  a  significant  interaction  with  vinflunine  on  OS, 
PFS and DCR and the effect of the treatment arm was still found to be significant when adjusted for 
prior  platinum  based  therapies.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  modify  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  to 
include the following wording:  
In  the  two  multi-centre  open-label,  single-arm  phase  II  clinical  trials  a  total  of  202  patients  were 
treated with vinflunine. 
In  the  multi-centre,  open-label  controlled  phase  III  clinical  trial,  253  patients  were  randomised  to 
treatment with vinflunine + BSC (best supportive care) and 117 patients to the BSC arm.  
56/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  median  overall  survival  was  6.9  months  (vinflunine  +  BSC)  vs.  4.6  months  (BSC),  but  the 
difference  did  not  reach  statistical  significance;  hazard  ratio  0.88  (95%  CI  0.69,1.12).  However  a 
statistically  significant  effect  was  seen  on  progression-free  survival.  Median  PFS  was  3.0  months 
(vinflunine + BSC) vs 1.5 months (BSC) (p=0.0012). 
In  addition  a  pre-specified  multivariate analysis  performed  on  the  ITT population  demonstrated  that 
vinflunine had a statistically significant treatment effect (p=0.036) on overall survival when prognostic 
factors (PS, visceral involvement, alkaline phosphatases, haemoglobin, pelvic irradiation) were taken 
into  consideration;  hazard  ratio  0.77  (95%  CI  0.61,  0.98).  A  statistically  significant  difference  on 
overall survival (p=0.040) was also seen in the eligible population (which excluded 13 patients with 
clinically significant protocol violations at baseline who were not eligible for treatment); hazard ratio 
0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99). This is considered the most relevant population for the efficacy analysis, as 
it most closely reflects the population intended for treatment.  
Efficacy was demonstrated in both patients with and without prior cisplatin use.  
In the eligible population, the subgroup analyses according to the prior cisplatin use versus BSC on 
overall survival (OS) showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.64 (0.40 – 1.03); p=0.0821] in the absence of prior 
cisplatin, and a HR (95% CI) = [0.80 (0.60 – 1.06); p=0.1263] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When 
adjusted on prognostic factors, the analyses of OS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior 
cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.53 (0.32 – 0.88); p=0.0143] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.70 (0.53 – 
0.94); p=0.0174], respectively. 
In  the  subgroup  analyses  of  prior  cisplatin  use  versus  BSC  for  progression  free  survival  (PFS),  the 
results were: HR (95% CI) = [0.55 (0.34 – 0.89); p=0.0129] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR 
(95%  CI)  =  [0.64  (0.48  –  0.85);  p=0.0040]  in  the  presence  of  prior  cisplatin.  When  adjusted  on 
prognostic  factors,  the  analyses  of  PFS  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  without  or  with  prior  cisplatin 
showed  a  HR  (95%  CI)  =  [0.51(0.31  –  0.86);  p=0.0111]  and  a  HR  (95%  CI)  =  [0.63(0.48  –  0.84); 
p=0.0016], respectively. 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  all  these  efficacy  results,  together  with  the  acceptable  and 
manageable safety of the drug demonstrated meaningful efficacy in the context of this patient group, 
with a short life expectancy and with an unmet medical need. Following the responses to both major 
objections, The CHMP considered that the Applicant had adequately demonstrated that the magnitude 
of the efficacy effects observed with vinflunine were comparable or greater than those observed and 
considered as clinically meaningful with other approved anticancer drugs in different and comparable 
settings.  The  meaningful  efficacy  effect  was  reinforced  by  the  positive  results  of  vinflunine  across 
endpoints.   
When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology raised some concerns about the quality of the study 
(long duration of recruitment into the study, the large number of ineligible patients, the control arm not 
including  other  available  options),  that  the  claimed  effects  were  not  consistent  across  different 
endpoints  as  the  response  rate  was  low,  and  that  the  population  studied  was  very  heterogeneous 
concerning important prognostic factors for survival. The SAG agreed that the claimed difference in 
terms of overall survival would be clinically meaningful, provided that the claimed difference could be 
established using robust methodology. Although meaningful, the size of the effect on OS in the overall 
population  was  considered  as  modest.  However,  if  efficacy  were  established  based  on  robust 
methodology, the SAG stated that would be of interest to identify patients that might be more likely to 
benefit from this treatment. Currently, it was considered difficult to identify such population. 
In addition, the CHMP raised other concerns with regards to the clinical efficacy data submitted in this 
dossier. 
3. The applicant was asked to provide further discussion on the efficacy results of the Phase II studies 
in reference to available historical controls for TCCU patients. In the responses, the literature review 
demonstrates  that  when  compared  to  other  anti-cancer  agents  in  patients  with  TCCU,  VFL  had 
57/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
favourable activity. The data were considered to support the rationale for further study of vinflunine in 
the proposed indication. 
4. The study Ca 183002 was prematurely terminated due to unexplained reasons. The clinical report of 
this study was submitted in the initial application and was requested by the CHMP, in particular, the 
reasons that led to study early termination, as these may include efficacy or safety issues that may be 
absolutely  relevant  to  the  present  application.  In  the  applicant’s  responses,  the  reasons  for  early  Ca 
183002  study  termination  were  explained  and  the  clinical  report  of  this  study  was  provided.    Early 
termination  of  this  study  was  due  to  commercial  and  development  priorities  matters  and  not  to  any 
major safety or efficacy issues related to vinflunine therapy.  
5.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  submit  data  on  the  number  of  trial  subjects  in  each  arm  who  post-
progression received chemotherapy, indicating what the type of chemotherapy was administered. The 
proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy at disease progression was well balanced between study 
arms, with slightly higher figures as expected among patients allocated to BSC (34.2%) than among 
VFL  treated  patients  (28.8%).    Of  them,  the  percentage  of  patients  that  received  multiple  agents  at 
disease  progression  was  62.5%  (BSC  arm)  versus  57.5%  (VFL  arm).    Therefore,  an  unbalanced 
distribution of further subsequent therapies among study arms was considered unlikely to have had a 
major impact  in the ability  to  observe  a  survival  benefit  for VFL  treated  patients.    In  addition,  data 
submitted  suggests  that  vinflunine  therapy  does  not  compromise  the  ability  to  receive  further 
treatment. 
6. In line with the appendix on methodological issues on PFS in the CHMP anticancer guideline, the 
CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  address  sensitivity  analyses  and  discuss  how  ascertainment  bias 
can  be  ruled  out  for  the  PFS  results  submitted.  From  the  applicant’s  responses,  all  the  efficacy 
assessments  were  reviewed  by  a  blinded  Independent  Review  Committee  and  the  time  interval 
between tumour assessments was descriptively investigated. This was shown to be balanced between 
the study arms. The applicant carried out PFS sensitivity analyses in order to confirm the consistency 
of the initial results. Sensitivity analyses of PFS showed consistency, confirming the benefit of VFL + 
BSC treatment. 
7.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  statistically  significant  improvement  in  progression  free  survival 
obtained was small and clinically marginal. The applicant was therefore asked to explain any relating 
clinical relevance. In its responses, the applicant demonstrated that TCCU patients perform favourably 
in  terms  of  PFS  when  compared  to  historical  controls.  In  the  context  of  wider  clinical  practice,  to 
support  the  claim  of  clinical  relevance,  the  size  of  increase  in  PFS  is  similar  to  other  licensed  anti-
cancer agents in comparable situations. 
8.  The  demographic  baseline  characteristics  in  VFL  302  showed  overall  comparability  in  many 
aspects. Nevertheless the number of patients with disease stage unknown was considerably higher in 
the active treatment arm (14.6%) vs the BSC control arm: (7.7%). Since the disease of stage is related 
to  survival  prognosis,  unfamiliarity  with  this  important  aspect  may  induce  considerable  bias.  The 
CHMP recommended that a sensitivity analysis would reveal the impact of these cases with unknown 
stage  of  disease.  The  additional  analysis  supplied  by  the  applicant  demonstrated  that  the  benefit  in 
terms of overall survival of the VFL + BSC group compared with the BSC group was not due to the 
effect of disease stage at diagnosis. In terms of overall survival in the ITT population, when adjusted 
for  the  effects  of  potential  prognostic  factors  including  disease  stage  at  diagnosis,  the  effect  of  the 
treatment arm was significant (p= 0.0221), showing a reduction of risk of death of 26% for the VFL + 
BSC group compared with the BSC group. 
9.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  study  population  was  not  representative  for  the  patient  in  daily 
practice with advanced urothelial cancer progressive after first line chemotherapy as only Performance 
Status 0-1 patients were included, whereas the majority of patients have a poor Performance Status of 
2 in whom any benefit of systemic therapy will be lower. Given that only patients with PS 0 and 1 
were included in the phase III trial, which may not reflect the overall population of the patients with 
advanced TTCU relapsing after a platinum-containing regimen, the SPC was amended to reflect the 
58/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following statement in section 4.1:  “Efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients 
with Performance Status ≥2”. 
Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
A  total  of  1203  patients  received  4617  cycles  of  vinflunine  as  a  single  agent,  either  in  the  TCCU 
indication (450 patients) or in Non-TCCU setting. Safety analyses included all subjects who received 
at least one dose of study medication. 1202 cycles were administered in the 320 mg/m² group, with a 
median number of cycles delivered of 4 (range 1-21). 620 cycles were administered in the 280 mg/m² 
group, with a median number of cycles delivered of 2 (range 1-20).

Deaths 
107  patients  (8.9%)  died  within  30  days  following  the  last  vinflunine  infusion.  The  rates  of  deaths 
within the 30 days were 7.0 % for TCCU patients in the 320 mg/m² group, 14.6% in the 280 mg/m² 
group and 8.2% in Non-TCCU patients. In all TCCU patients, the rate of death within 30 days was 
10.0%.  Twenty  out  of  45  deaths  occurring  within  the  30  days  following  the  last  study  drug 
administration were due to disease progression. The most frequent adverse event leading to death was 
pulmonary embolism (8 patients). 
In the TCCU patients, 6 study drug related deaths were recorded, 4 in the 320 mg/m² group. Two were 
in relation to myelosuppression (pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia), one was in relation to septicaemia 
and  one  in  relation  to  a  cardio-pulmonary  arrest.  Two  study  drug  related  deaths  in  the  280  mg/m² 
group  died  due  to  infection  associated  with  bone  marrow  depletion  and  one  lethal  myocardial 
infarction. When Non-TCCU patients were considered, 4 out of the 6 deaths due to study medication 
related to AEs that were a consequence of severe infection.

•  Laboratory findings 
Hematological toxicity 
Neutropenia  is  a  frequent  adverse  reaction  of  vinflunine.  Adequate  monitoring  of  complete  blood 
counts  should  be  conducted  to  verify  the  ANC  value  before  each  vinflunine  infusion.  The 
recommended dose should be reduced in patients with Grade>3 haematological toxicity (see section 
4.2 of the SPC). Vinflunine should not be administered when the ANC < 1,000/mm3 and/or platelets  
< 100,000/mm3. 
Haemoglobin.  
Anaemia  was  commonly  observed  in  90.8%,  96.0%  and  81.7%  of  the  TCCU  (320  mg/m²),  TCCU 
(280 mg/m²) and Non-TCCU patients, respectively. In the BSC arm of the Phase III trial (VFL 302), 
2/3 of patients (61.3%) also experienced anaemia.  
During the treatment period, severe anaemia (grade 3, haemoglobin ≥ 6.5 g/dl < 8.0 g/dl; or grade 4, 
haemoglobin < 6.5g/dl) was recorded in 14.8 % of TCCU (320 mg/m²) patients and in 21.3 % TCCU 
(280  mg/m²)  patients.  Grade  4  anaemia  was  rare,  occurring  in  only  5  patients  (1.8%)  in  the  TCCU 
(320  mg/m²),  and  7  cases  (4.0%)  in  the  TCCU  patients  treated  at  280  mg/m².  Grade  3/4  anaemia 
occurred in 5.9% of cycles in the TCCU patients and in 1.9% of the cycles in Non-TCCU patients. 
Seven percent (6.8%) of the patients had no anaemia at baseline, but experienced grade 3/4 anaemia as 
the  worst  grade  during  treatment.  Forty  seven  percent  (568/1203)  of  patients  treated  with  VFL 
presented  with  anaemia  at  baseline.  Among  patients  presenting  with  grade  1/2  at  baseline  anaemia 
worsened to reach grade 3/4 events in 27.2% of patients during treatment. 
Leucocytes  
A  total  of  120  (44.3%)  of  the  TCCU  patients  in  the  320  mg/m²  group  and  81  (46.6%)  of  the  280 
mg/m²  group  experienced grade  3/4  leucopenia  during  vinflunine  treatment.  In  Non-TCCU  patients, 
the incidence of grade 3/4 leucopenia is lower (30.8%). 
At baseline, TCCU patients were required to have a baseline neutrophils (ANC) value of at least 1.5 x 
109/L in VFL 302 and CA 001 studies and of 2.0 x 109/L in the VFL 202 study.

Neutropenia  was  commonly  observed  in  all  data  sets.  Grades  3/4  severity  was  recorded  in  57.2%, 
50.6%  and  47.6%  of  patients  in  TCCU  (320  mg/m²),  TCCU  (280  mg/m²)  and  Non-TCCU  patients, 
respectively. Grade 3/4 neutropenia induced few major clinical consequences: 
- Febrile neutropenia was recorded in 7% of the TCCU patients treated at 320 mg/m² (1.8% of cycle), 
6.2% of patients treated at 280 mg/m² (1.8% of cycles) and in 4.5% of Non-TCCU patients (1.3% of 
cycles); only one patient died due to this adverse event (Patient 202-130601). 
-  Infections  with  severe  neutropenia  and  any  grade  of  infection  were  observed  in  4.7%  of  TCCU 
patients  (4.0%  treated  at  320  mg/m²  and  5.6%  treated  at  280  mg/m²)  and  in  2.5%  of  Non-TCCU 
patients. 
-  The  rate  of  severe  infection  with  severe  neutropenia  was  very  low  (grade 4  life  threatening  sepsis 
(e.g. septic shock): 1.1% of TCCU patients). 
-  Overall  7  deaths  were  reported  (0.5%)  from  infection  as  a  complication  occurring  during 
neutropenia. Five of those 7 deaths were observed in second line treatment (Two in NSCLC patients 
301-090104, 301-570106; one in ovarian cancer patient 208-520211 and two in TCCU patients 202-
130102, CA001-13-124). 
- Among the patients treated at the recommended dose of 320 mg/m², the median nadir of neutrophils 
at cycle 1was observed at 0.9 x 109 L ( range [0 ; 2.8 x 109 L] at the 8.5 day ,range [7 ; 17]. These 
values have been obtained from the phase I study in which WBC counts were performed twice every 
week. 
Platelets 
 In TCCU trials, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 10 patients (3.7%) among those treated 
at 320 mg/m² and in 12 patients (6.9%) among those treated at 280 mg/m², as compared to Non-TCCU 
patients (2.7%). In all studies, the threshold baseline value of platelets was 100 x 109/L.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Severe  constipation  occurred  in  15.3%  of  treated  patients.  Constipation  is  reversible  and  not 
cumulative. Special dietary measures such as oral hydration should be taken and laxatives should be 
administered  from  day  1  to  day  5  or  7  of  the  treatment  cycle.  Patients  at  high  risk  of  constipation 
(concomitant treatment with opiates, peritoneal carcinomas, abdominal masses, prior heavy abdominal 
surgery) should be medicated with polyethylene glycol from day 1 to day 7 administered once a day in 
the morning before breakfast. 
In  case  of  Grade  2  constipation  for  more  than  5  days  and  Grade≥ 3  of  any  duration,  the  dose  of 
vinflunine should be adjusted (see section 4.2 of the SPC).  
Therefore, the following warning was adequately reflected in the SPC: The concomitant use of opioids 
could enhance the risk of constipation. 
In case of any Grade≥ 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (except vomiting or nausea) and of mucositis (Grade 
2 for more than 5 days and Grade≥ 3 of any duration) dose adjustment is required (see section 4.2 of 
the SPC). 
Cardiac disorders  
Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. This effect 
may  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of  ventricular  arrhytmias  although  no  ventricular  arrhythmias  were 
observed  with  vinflunine.  Nevertheless,  vinflunine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with 
increase  of  the  proarrhytmic  risk  (e.g.,  congestive  heart  failure,  known  history  of  QT  interval 
prolongation,  hypokalemia)  (see  section  4.8  of  the  SPC).  The  concomittant  use  of  two  or  more 
QT/QTc interval prolonging drugs is not recommended (see section 4.5 of the SPC). 
Special  attention  is  recommended  when  vinflunine  is  administered  to  patients  with  prior  history  of 
myocardial  infarction/ischemia  or  angina  pectoris  (see  section  4.8  of  the  SPC).  Ischaemic  cardiac 
75/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
events may occur, especially in patients who have underlying cardiac disease. Thus, patients receiving 
Javlor  should  be  vigilantly  monitored  by  physicians  for  the  occurrence  of  cardiac  events.  Caution 
should  be  exercised  in  patients  with  a  history  of  cardiac  disease  and  the  benefit  /  risk  assessment 
should be carefully evaluated regularly. Discontinuation of vinflunine should be considered in patients 
who develop cardiac ischaemia. 
Liver function 
Bilirubin.  Overall,  the  incidence  of  grades  3  and  4  toxicity  was  low  and  there  was  no  relevant 
difference  between  groups:  1.9%  in  TCCU  (320  mg/m²)  patients,  2.4%  in  TCCU  (280  mg/m²) 
patients, and 0.8% in Non-TCCU patients.

As regards to alkaline phosphatase, the picture is very similar. 18 patients (4.1%) experienced grade 3 
or 4 levels.  
Grade 3 and grade 4 levels of SGOT/AST and SGPT/ALT were very infrequently observed 3 cases 
(0.7), whatever the data set of patients. 
Renal function 
In  studies  VFL  302  and  VFL  202,  the  lower  limit  of  calculated  creatinine  clearance  (Cockroft  and 
Gault formula) for study inclusion was 40 ml/min. In the CA 001 study, this lower limit was extended 
to 20 ml/min. Forty three percent of TCCU patients had a creatinine clearance below normal value (< 
60  mL/min)  at  baseline,  this  is  probably  related  both  to  the  disease  setting  and  to  prior  cisplatin 
exposure (68.2% of patients having received a prior CDDP containing regimen). Furthermore, 6.0% of 
these patients had a calculated creatinine clearance lower than 40 mL/min. there was no worsening of 
levels of serum creatinine on study. 
Serum creatinine levels observed during treatment were higher in the TCCU population (43.0%) than 
in  the  Non-TCCU  patients  (14.2%).  The  same  trend  is  observed  when  considering  the  grade  3/4 
creatininaemia  which  remain  very  low  (TCCU:  1.1%,  Non-TCCU:  0.4%).  The  difference  of  rate 
between TCCU and Non-TCCU is probably explained by the disease setting: the upper urinary tract 
can be impaired by the TCCU and by prior platinum containing chemotherapy (nephrotoxic agent). A 
total of 5 TCCU patients (1.1%) had grade 3 levels of serum creatinine during treatment. Of note, 3 
(2.8%)  BSC  arm  patients  in  the  TCCU  study  VFL  302  had  also  grade  3  or  4  as  worst  grade.).  In 
patient presenting normal values of serum creatinine at baseline, only 20% of TCCU patients treated 
with VFL had a grade 1 to 4 level of serum creatinine, as compared to 36% of BSC patients. 
According to the NCI CTC version 2.0, Grade 3  and 4 hyponatraemia are defined as serum sodium 
level between 120 mmol/L to 130 mmol/L and < 120 mmol/L respectively. The incidence is slightly 
higher (13.7%) in TCCU patients treated at 280 mg/m². The incidence of hyponatraemia is higher in 
TCCU patients (11.7%) than in Non-TCCU patients (6.8%).  
•  Safety in special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
A  phase  I  pharmacokinetic  dose  adjusted  study  of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  liver 
dysfunction  was  carried  out.  Both  vinflunine  and  DVFL  PK  parameters  showed  no  significant 
differences  between  patients  with  liver  impairment  and  control  groups.    However,  the  safety 
76/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evaluation  in  the  Phase  I  study  indicated  that  the  dose  of  vinflunine  needed  to  be  adjusted  to  250 
mg/m²  for  patients  with  moderate  impairment  and  200  mg/m²  for  patients  with  severe  impairment. 
Therefore, the recommended dose should be reduced in patients with level 2 or 3 hepatic impairment 
(see section 4.2 of the SPC) 
Group 1: Mild chronic liver dysfunction 
At the recommended dose of 320 mg/m², 6 patients were treated for a total of 15 cycles. Anaemia was 
seen in all patients and all cycles but no grade 3 or 4 were reported. Neutropenia grade 4 was reported 
in  2  patients  for  a  total  of  2  cycles  and  a  grade  3  neutropenia  was  reported  twice  in  one  patient.  A 
single episode of grade 3 fatigue was described. 
Group 2: Moderate chronic liver dysfunction 
At  the  recommended  dose  of  250  mg/m²,  6  evaluable  patients.  1  experienced  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia. 5 patients experienced anaemia and leucopenia. One episode of febrile neutropenia 
was recorded and 2 experienced grade 3 fatigue. One patient presented grade 1 neuropathy sensory. 
No other grades 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicities were reported in a total of 50 cycles. 
Group 3: Severe chronic liver dysfunction 
At the recommended dose of 200 mg/m², the 9 patients treated for a total of 37 cycles had anaemia 
which was graded 3 in 2 patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were observed in 4 patients and grade 3 
thrombocytopenia was seen in 2 patients. As regards non-haematological toxicities no grade 4 event 
was recorded. Five cases of grade 3 were observed, 2 patients experienced fatigue and 3 episodes of 
diarrhoea, gastric ulcer and melena were observed. 
Table 44. Dose limiting toxicities at cycle 1 by group of liver impairment and by Vinflunine dose 
Following the safety evaluation, the dose in patients with hepatic liver impairment is: 
In  patients  with  mild liver  dysfunction (Prothrombin  Time  ≥70%  and  ULN  < bilirubin ≤1.5  x  ULN 
and/or 1.5 x ULN < transaminases ≤2.5 x ULN and/or ULN < GGT ≤5 ULN), the recommended dose 
of vinflunine is 320 mg/m² given on day 1 every 3 weeks 
In  patients  with  moderate  chronic  liver  dysfunction  (Child-Pugh  grade  A  cirrhosis  or  prothrombin 
Time ≥60% and 1.5 x ULN < bilirubin ≤3 x ULN and transaminases > ULN and/or GGT > 5 x ULN) 
vinflunine recommended dose is 250 mg/m² on day 1 every 3 weeks; 
In patients with severe chronic liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh grade B cirrhosis prothrombin Time ≥50 
%  and  1.5  x  ULN  <  bilirubin  >3  x  ULN  and  transaminases  >  ULN  and  GGT  >  ULN)  vinflunine 
recommended dose is 200 mg/m², on day 1 every 3 weeks. 
Renal impairment 
77/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The interim analysis from  a Phase I study regarding the vinflunine use in cancer patients with renal 
impairment  was  provided.  Clcr  of  vinflunine  decreased  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  This 
decrease was of approximately 16% in patients with moderate renal impairment (Creatinine clearance 
(calculated)  from  40  ml/min  to 60  ml/min.)  and  of  approximately  30%  in  patients  with  severe renal 
impairment  (Creatinine  clearance  (calculated)  from  ≥20  ml/min  to  ≤40  ml/min).  Therefore,  the 
recommended  dose  should  be  reduced  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (see 
section 4.2 of the SPC). 
Dose recommendations in patients with renal impairment are as follows: 
Moderate renal impairment (40 ml/min ≤ Clcr ≤ 60 ml/min): the recommended vinflunine  dose is 280 
mg/m²;  
Severe renal impairment (20 ml/min ≤ Clcr < 40 ml/min): the recommended VFL dose is 250mg/m². 
Elderly 
A pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in elderly cancer patients started in January 2005 and is still 
ongoing.  
Paediatric population 
No studies have been submitted in this specific population. 
• 
Immunological events 
No data was submitted with regards to immunological events. A justification was provided.  
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The risks of Drug Drug Interactions (DDI) were investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies as 
well as through population PK analysis.vinflunine Cltot statistics obtained in combined chemotherapy 
clinical trials are summarised in the table below. 
Table 45. Safety Summary Related to DDDI with Vinflunine 
When combined with each chemotherapy agent, except pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLDH), 
vinflunine exhibited a constant clearance with less than 15% difference compared to the control values 
(single agent vinflunine). A significant effect of PLDH on vinflunine Cltot was demonstrated (>15% - 
30% decrease). The impact of vinflunine on PLDH was a 2-3-fold apparent increase in drug clearance 
and  volume  of  distribution.  The  mechanism  of  interaction  was  explored in  vitro,  demonstrating  that 
vinflunine is strongly adsorbed on to PLDH vesicles.  
A  dose-finding  and  pharmacokinetic  study  of  IV  vinflunine  combined  with  PLDH  in  a  variety  of 
advanced solid tumours was carried out (L00070 IN 1 08 J1). The study recommended two schedules 
for dose adjustments if combining vinflunine with PLDH. In schedule 1, the vinflunine recommended 
dose is 250 mg/m² together with PLDH 25 mg/m² both given on day 1 every 21 Days. In schedule 2, 
the vinflunine recommended dose is 170 mg/m² given on days 1 and 8 together with PLDH 25 mg/m² 
given on day 1, every 21 days.

Other  studies  indicate  that  only  strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  such  as  Itraconazole,  Ritonavir  and 
ketoconazole are  likely  to  inhibit  the  metabolism  of  vinflunine. Taxanes  compounds  (i.e.:  paclitaxel 
and docetaxel) also inhibit metabolism of vinflunine but to a lesser degree. The effect of ketoconazole 
was confirmed in vivo in a specific Phase I study. Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg/day for 
8 days) resulted in an increase of 31% in dose normalised AUCinf of vinflunine, a 31% increase in 
dose-normalized  AUC  (0-96h)  of  DVFL  and  a  49%  increase  in  dose-normalized  AUC  (0-168h)  of 
DVFL.  Co-administration  of  ketoconazole  at  400  mg  per  day  for  8  days  did  not  affect  the  dose-
normalized Cmax of a 20 minute IV infusion of vinflunine but increased the dose-normalized Cmax 
for DVFL by 17%. The MTD of vinflunine is defined as 160 mg/m² when co-administered with 400 
mg of ketoconazole. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most common reasons for discontinuation were progressive disease (54.9%) in the vinflunine + 
BSC  group  and  completion  of  the  18-week  period  (29.1%)  and  progressive  disease  (26.5%)  in  the 
BSC group. 
13.1%  of  the  patients  discontinued  the  treatment  after  one  cycle.  25.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  280 
mg/m² group received only one cycle versus 5.1% of the patients in the 320 mg/m² group. The main 
reasons for discontinuation after cycle 1 reported in the 280 mg/m² group were progression (20.0% of 
the patients) and related AEs (22.2% of the patients) 
53  TCCU  patients  treated  with  vinflunine  stopped  their  treatment  due  to  treatment  related  adverse 
events. The table below lists the reasons for discontinuation and the number of patients discontinued in 
each treatment arm.

•  Post marketing experience 
No postmarketing data has been submitted as this product is not commercially available, anywhere. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
the  main 
The overall patient exposure to vinflunine was considered adequate for safety assessment. In TCCU 
toxicities  of  vinflunine  were  neutropenia,  anaemia,  constipation  and 
patients, 
asthenia/fatigue.  All  of  these  adverse events  are  considered  class  effects  of the vinca  alkaloids. The 
safety  profile  of  vinflunine  was  similar  for  both  TCCU  and  Non-TCCU  populations,  except  for 
constipation,  infection  with  severe  neutropenia,  stomatitis/mucositis  and  febrile  neutropenia.  The 
safety  profile  of  vinflunine  in  both  dosages  groups  (280  mg/m²/320  mg/m²)  was  comparable  with 
slightly  higher  rates  of  AEs  were  seen  in  the  280  mg/m²  group.  The  most  frequent  adverse  event 
leading to death in all patients treated with vinflunine was pulmonary embolism. These deaths were 
judged not to be related to the study medication. 
79/89 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The following concerns were raised with regards to the clinical safety data submitted as part of this 
dossier. 
1. The CHMP requested that the applicant provide a discussion on rarer adverse events. The applicant 
was  also  asked  to  comment  on  the  type  and  incidence  of  adverse  events  other  than  ‘common’, 
particularly those related to the study medication.  From the data submitted. The CHMP noted no new 
safety concerns. The data was considered to clarify the acceptable safety prolife of vinflunine in the 
proposed indication.  
2.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  incidence  of  SAE  in  subjects  treated  with  vinflunine,  by 
commenting  on  the  observed  frequencies  of  SAE  in  the  vinflunine  +  BSC  arm,  comparing  the 
observed  safety  profile  of  vinflunine  with  other  vinca  alkaloids,  in  particular,  cardiovascular  and 
peripheral  neuropathic  AEs,  including  autonomic  neuropathy.  From  the  data  submitted  the  CHMP 
considered that there were no new safety concerns. The data were considered to clarify the acceptable 
safety prolife of vinflunine in the proposed indication.  
3.    The  CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  provide  a  full  and  detailed  discussion  on  QTc  interval 
prolongation, in line with current guidelines (CPMP/986/96 points to consider: The assessment of the 
potential for QT interval prolongation by non-cardiovascular medicinal products).  
Based  on  the  applicant’s  response,  in  phase  I  studies,  more  than  100  ECGs  were  collected  and 
carefully measured. QTc prolongation was not observed except in one subject whose change in QTc 
from baseline was found to be 67 msec at distance (~167 h) from the infusion of vinflunine at the time 
when  plasma  concentration  of  vinflunine  had  decreased  to  a  low  level  of  3.7  ng/mL  (higher  plasma 
concentrations  were  not  associated  with  QTc  prolongation  in  this  subject).In  the  clinical  studies 
database,  no  adverse  event  of  the  type  usually  associated  with  torsade  de  pointes  was  observed.  In 
addition to this, vinflunine belongs to the class of vinca alkaloids which is not known to be associated 
with  QTc  interval  prolongation  and  its  associated  pro-arrhythmic  events.  However,  the  CHMP 
considered that there were 3 cases in the study CA183001 with a QT interval prolonged that had not 
been sufficiently justified. Five cases in the same study had a ∆QTcF between 31 and 60 msec and one 
subject had a  ∆QTcF exceeding 60 msec. Despite these increases being lower than 500 msec, it could 
be considered as a safety problem to be taken into account.  
The CHMP therefore agreed that an amendment to the SPC wording be made regarding the potential 
QT interval prolongation at sections 4.4,  and 4.8 of the SPC. 
The concomitant use of Javlor with others QT/QTc interval prolonging drugs should be avoided (see 
SPC section 4.4)  
Cardiac effects are a known class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Myocardial infarction or ischemia were 
experienced by 0.6% of the patients and most of them had a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk 
factors. One patient died after myocardial infarction and another one due to a cardiopulmonary arrest. 
Few  QT  interval  prolongations  have  been  observed  after  the  administration  of  vinflunine.  (see  SPC 
section 4.8) 
When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology noted that the observed toxicity was considered as 
significant although the possible QTc effect did not raise particular concerns in the light of the overall 
toxicity profile and the applied indication, and overall agreed that due to the large unmet need in the 
applied indication, the safety profile did not raise particular concerns. 
4.  A  potential  risk  of  pancreatitis  associated  with  vinorelbine  use  was  recorded.  Therefore,  the 
Applicant  was    asked  to  discuss  whether  the  risk  of  pancreatitis  should  be  included  in  the  SPC  for 
Javlor. During vinflunine clinical trials, only 1 patient administered vinflunine injectable experienced 
pancreatitis NCI-CTC grade 3 (USBMS-C-20060024). This patient’s medical history and concomitant 
drugs  were  considered  to  be  pancreatitis  risk  factors.    Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
rationale to include pancreatitis as a potential side effect was not supported by the available evidence. 
80/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
5. The  CHMP   considered  it  was  hard to  estimate  the  magnitude  of the  tolerability  problems,  given 
that  gastrointestinal  grade  3/4  adverse  reactions  were  very  prevalent.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  was 
asked to provide information about the duration and incidence per treatment cycle, the manageability 
of constipation with laxatives, as well as the incidence of hospitalizations per treatment cycle. Based 
on the Applicant’s response, the CHMP noted that in general, gastrointestinal adverse events induced 
by vinflunine were manageable. Out of the 450 TCCU patients treated with VFL, 35 were hospitalized 
for  constipation  -  40  events  in  total.  18/40  of  these  events  occurred  in  the  phase  III  study.  All  40 
events  of  constipation  resolved,  with  a  median  time  to  recovery  of  5  days  either  after  laxative 
treatments (osmotics and/or stimulants and/or enema) or without any specific treatment.  
As  well  as  dose  reduction  information  following  the  advent  of  constipation,  section  4.2  of  the 
proposed SPC states ‘In order to prevent constipation, laxatives and dietary measures including oral 
hydration are recommended from day 1 to day 5 or 7 after each vinflunine administration (see section 
4.4)’.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  overall,  VFL  induced  constipation  was  non-cumulative, 
reversible, of relatively short duration and relative free of major clinical consequences.   
When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology noted that the observed toxicity was considered as 
significant  although no particular concerns were raised in  light of the overall toxicity profile and the 
applied indication, and overall agreed that due to the large unmet need in the applied indication, the 
safety profile did not raise particular concerns. 
The SPC also includes the following: 
The  concomitant  use  of  potent  inhibitors  or  potent  inducers  of  CYP3A4  with  vinflunine  should  be 
avoided(see section 4.5 of the SPC). 
When infused through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce Grade 1 (22%of the patients, 14.1% of 
the cycles), Grade 2 (11.0% of the patients, 6.8% of the cycles) or Grade 3 (0.8% of the patients, 0.2% 
of  the  cycles)  venous  irritation.  All  cases  resolved  rapidly  without  treatment  discontinuation. 
Instructions for administration should be followed as described in section 6.6. 
Men and women with reproductive potential must use an effective method of contraception during the 
treatment and up to 3 months after the last vinflunine administration (see section 4.6 of the SPC). 
No  studies  on the  effects on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines have  been performed.    However, 
patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a 
potential impact on the ability to perform these activities (e.g. dizziness, syncope are common). (See 
SPC section 4.7 of the SPC) 
The main toxic effect due to an overdose with vinflunine is bone marrow suppression with a risk of 
severe infection. There is no known antidote for vinflunine overdose. In case of overdose, the patient 
should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions should be closely monitored. Other appropriate 
measures should be taken, such as blood transfusions, administration of antibiotics and growth factors 
(see SPC section 4.9 of the SPC).

ventricular arrhythmias were observed with vinflunine. Nevertheless, 
vinflunine should be used with caution in patients with increase of the 
proarrhytmic risk (e.g., congestive heart failure, known history of QT 
interval prolongation, hypokalemia) (see section 4.8). The 
concomittant use of two or more QT/QTc interval prolonging 
substances is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Special attention is recommended when vinflunine is administered to 
patients with prior history of myocardial infarction/ischemia or 
angina pectoris (see section 4.8). Ischaemic cardiac events may occur, 
especially in patients who have underlying cardiac disease. Thus, 
patients receiving Javlor should be vigilantly monitored by physicians 
for the occurrence of cardiac events. Caution should be exercised in 
patients with a history of cardiac disease and the benefit / risk 
assessment should be carefully evaluated regularly. Discontinuation 
of vinflunine should be considered in patients who develop cardiac 
ischaemia.”

Paragraph “Pregnancy”: “There is no data available on the use of 
vinflunine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). On the basis of 
the results of animal studies and the pharmacological action of the 
product, there is a potential risk of embryonic and foetal 
abnormalities. 
Vinflunine should therefore not be used during pregnancy, unless it is 
strictly necessary. If pregnancy occurs during treatment, the patient 
should be informed about the risk for the unborn child and be 
monitored carefully. The possibility of genetic counselling should be 
considered. Genetic counselling is also recommended for patients 
wishing to have children after therapy.” 
Paragraph “Fertility”:  “Both male and female patients should take 
adequate contraceptive measures up to three months after the 
discontinuation of the therapy. Advice on conservation of sperm 
should be sought prior to treatment because of the possibility of 
irreversible infertility due to therapy with vinflunine”. 
Paragraph “Lactation”: It is unknown if vinflunine or its metabolites 
are  excreted  in  the  breast  milk.  Due  to  the  possible  very  harmful 
effects on the infants, breast-feeding during treatment with vinflunine 
is contraindicated (see section 4.3)”.

3.6   Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  is  one  unresolved  quality  issues,  which  do  not  have  any 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. This will be addressed as part of the follow-
up measure post-authorisation. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology  
85/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vinflunine  distribution  in  rats  by  imaging  techniques  illustrated  that  the  compound  levels  in  lungs, 
kidneys, liver, salivary and endocrine glands, and gastrointestinal tract were rapidly higher than those 
in blood.  
Preclinical data revealed moderate to severe neutropenia and mild anaemia, in all species tested, with 
liver toxicity in dogs and rats (characterized by dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases and 
hepatic  necrosis/hepatocellular  alterations  at  high  doses).  These  toxic  effects  were  dose-related,  and 
fully or partially reversible following a 1-month recovery period. Vinflunine did not induce peripheral 
neuropathy in animals. 
Vinflunine has shown to be clastogenic (induces chromosome breakage) in the in vivo micronucleus 
test  in  rat  as  well  as  mutagenic  and  clastogenic  in  mouse  lymphoma  assay  (without  metabolic 
activation). 
The carcinogenic potential of vinflunine has not been studied.  
In  the  reproduction  studies,  vinflunine  appeared  to  be  embryolethal  and  teratogenic  in  rabbits  and 
teratogenic in rats. 
During  the  pre-and  post-natal  development  study  in  rat,  vinflunine  induced  malformations  of  the 
uterus and vagina in 2 females, and adversely affected mating and/or ovule implantation and markedly 
lowered the number of concepti. 
Efficacy 
One phase III and two phase II trials support the use of Javlor for treatment of advanced or metastatic 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium as second-line therapy after failure of a prior platinum-
containing regimen. 
In  the  two  multi-centre  open-label,  single-arm  phase  II  clinical  trials  a  total  of  202  patients  were 
treated with vinflunine. 
In  the  multi-centre,  open-label  controlled  phase  III  clinical  trial,  253  patients  were  randomised  to 
treatment with vinflunine + BSC (best supportive care) and 117 patients to the BSC arm.  
The  median  overall  survival  was  6.9  months  (vinflunine  +  BSC)  vs.  4.6  months  (BSC),  but  the 
difference  did  not  reach  statistical  significance;  hazard  ratio  0.88  (95%  CI  0.69,1.12).  However  a 
statistically  significant  effect  was  seen  on  progression-free  survival.  Median  PFS  was  3.0  months 
(vinflunine + BSC) vs 1.5 months (BSC) (p=0.0012). 
In  addition  a  pre-specified  multivariate analysis  performed  on  the  ITT population  demonstrated  that 
vinflunine had a statistically significant treatment effect (p=0.036) on overall survival when prognostic 
factors (PS, visceral involvement, alkaline phosphatases, haemoglobin, pelvic irradiation) were taken 
into  consideration;  hazard  ratio  0.77  (95%  CI  0.61,  0.98).  A  statistically  significant  difference  on 
overall survival (p=0.040) was also seen in the eligible population (which excluded 13 patients with 
clinically significant protocol violations at baseline who were not eligible for treatment); hazard ratio 
0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99). This is considered the most relevant population for the efficacy analysis, as 
it most closely reflects the population intended for treatment.  
Efficacy was demonstrated in both patients with and without prior cisplatin use.  
In the eligible population, the subgroup analyses according to the prior cisplatin use versus BSC on 
overall survival (OS) showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.64 (0.40 – 1.03); p=0.0821] in the absence of prior 
cisplatin, and a HR (95% CI) = [0.80 (0.60 – 1.06); p=0.1263] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When 
adjusted on prognostic factors, the analyses of OS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior 
cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.53 (0.32 – 0.88); p=0.0143] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.70 (0.53 – 
0.94); p=0.0174], respectively. 
86/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  subgroup  analyses  of  prior  cisplatin  use  versus  BSC  for  progression  free  survival  (PFS),  the 
results were: HR (95% CI) = [0.55 (0.34 – 0.89); p=0.0129] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR 
(95%  CI)  =  [0.64  (0.48  –  0.85);  p=0.0040]  in  the  presence  of  prior  cisplatin.  When  adjusted  on 
prognostic  factors,  the  analyses  of  PFS  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  without  or  with  prior  cisplatin 
showed  a  HR  (95%  CI)  =  [0.51(0.31  –  0.86);  p=0.0111]  and  a  HR  (95%  CI)  =  [0.63(0.48  –  0.84); 
p=0.0016], respectively. 
Safety 
The most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions reported in the two phase II and one phase III 
trials  in  patients  with  transitional  cell  carcinoma  of  the  urothelium  (450  patients  treated  with 
leucopenia  and 
vinflunine)  were  haematological  disorders,  mainly  neutropenia,  anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia;

Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 54.6% of patients. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were 
less  common  (respectively  17.3  and  4.9%).  Febrile  neutropenia  defined  as  ANC  < 1,000/mm3and 
fever  ≥ 38.5°C  of  unknown  origin  without  clinically  microbiologically  documented  infection  (NCI 
CTC version 2.0) was observed in 6.7% of patients. Infection with grade 3/4 neutropenia is observed 
in  4.2%  of  patients.  Overall  6  patients  (1.3%  of  the  treated  population)  died  from  infection  as  a 
complication occurring during neutropenia. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Constipation is a class effect of the vinca alkaloids: 15.3% of patients experienced severe constipation 
during  treatment  with  vinflunine.  Grade  3/4  ileus  reported  in  2.7%  of  patients  was  reversible  when 
managed by medical care. Constipation is managed by medical care (see section 4.4 of the SPC). 
Nervous system disorders 
Sensory  peripheral  neuropathy  is  a  class  effect  of  the  vinca  alkaloids.  Grade  3  was  experienced  by 
0.2% patients. All resolved during the study. 
Cardiovascular disorders 
Cardiac effects are a known class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Myocardial infarction or ischemia were 
experienced by 0.6% of the patients and most of them had a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk 
factors. One patient died after myocardial infarction and another one due to a cardiopulmonary arrest. 
Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Dyspnoea occurred in 3.6% of the patients but was rarely severe (Grade 3/4: 0.4%). 
Bronchospam  was  reported  in  one  patient  treated  with  vinflunine  for  a  different  setting  from  the 
indication. 
Eye disorders: 
One case of vision blurred and visual acuity reduced have been reported. 
Endocrine disorders 
87/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three cases of suspected Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) have 
been reported in patients treated with Vinflunine for a different setting from the indication. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (See SPC section 4.8) 
Special precautions for disposal and other handling are adequately reflected in the SPC (see section 
6.6). 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  
•  User consultation 
The Applicant performed a readability testing (“user consultation”) and a satisfactory report has been

Risk-benefit assessment 
The efficacy results are consistent across endpoint and a difference in survival was observed based on 
a  number  of  secondary  analyses,  particularly  in  the  eligible  analysis  and  following  adjustment  for 
covariates.  Secondary  endpoints  all  favour  the  vinflunine  arm,  supporting  the  conclusion  that  the 
product  is  efficacious.  No  cumulative  toxicities  were  apparent  in  patients  with  TCCU  receiving 
vinflunine and in general, adverse events induced by vinflunine were transient and manageable. 
In the eligible population, a difference in median of about 2 months survival favouring the VFL+BSC 
arm was observed (6.9 months vs. 4.3 months). A stratified log-rank test showed a survival difference 
between  the  2  arms  (HR  0.78  [0.61,  0.99]  p=0.0403).  Furthermore,  a  significant  treatment  effect  of 
vinflunine  (p=0.036)  on  overall  survival  in  a  multivariate  Cox  analysis  conducted  in  the  ITT 
population  was  seen.  Vinflunine  reduced  the  risk  of death  by  23%  compared  to  BSC  with  a  hazard 
ratio  of  0.77  (95%  CI:  0.61-0.98).  Sensitivity  analyses  of  PFS  showed  consistency,  confirming  the 
benefit of VFL + BSC treatment.  
The  pivotal  study  failed  to  achieve  its  primary  endpoint,  apparently  because  of  the  inclusion  of 
ineligible  patients  who  had  not  failed  prior  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  However,  these  patients 
with  long  survivals  are  not  representative  of  the  targeted  population  and  might  explain  why  the 
treatment  effect  did  not  reach  significance  in  the  primary  analysis  of  the  ITT  population.  The  main 
toxicities  of  VFL  were  neutropenia  (79.6%),  anaemia  (92.8%),  constipation  (54.9%)  and 
asthenia/fatigue (55.3%), all these adverse events being class effects of the vinca alkaloids. The main 
dose limiting toxicity is neutropenia.  
There is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, whose disease 
has  progressed  after  or  during  a  prior  platinum-containing  regimen.  These  patients  have  a  median 
survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis.  
The CHMP considered that the data presented support the conclusion that vinflunine has meaningful 
activity  in  this  group  of  patients  and  therefore  fulfils  an  unmet  clinical  need.  The  magnitude  of  the 
efficacy  effects  observed  with  vinflunine  are  comparable  to  those  observed  and  considered  as 
clinically meaningful with other anticancer drugs in different and comparable settings. This effect is 
supported  by  the  positive  results  of  vinflunine  achieved  on  disease  symptoms  and  all  the  secondary 
endpoints  (PFS,  ORR,  DC).  Patient  exposure  to  vinflunine  is  considered  adequate  for  safety 
assessment. The main toxicities of vinflunine were class effects of the vinca alkaloids. No cumulative 
toxicities  were  apparent  and  in  general,  adverse  events  induced  by  vinflunine  were  transient  and 
manageable.  Overall,  the  evidence  supports  a  positive  benefit  risk  balance  for  vinflunine  in  adult 
patients with advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a 
prior platinum-containing regimen. 
88/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A minority of CHMP members expressed a divergent view whereby the positive benefit-risk balance 
for  Javlor  was  not  considered  to  be  established  in  the  applied  indication  because  of  insufficient 
evidence of efficacy in the presence of significant toxicity. In particular: 
•  No difference in the pre-specified primary analysis of overall survival was observed for vinflunine 
compared  to  best  standard  of  care  in  the  intent-to-treat  population,  based  on  the  single  pivotal 
study provided. 
•  Where  the  confirmatory  evidence  is  provided  by  one  pivotal  study  only,  this  study  has  to  be 
exceptionally compelling and special attention should be paid to internal and external validity. In 
the case of vinflunine, a difference in overall survival was only observed in post hoc exploratory 
analyses, excluding patients from the intent-to-treat population. However, potential biases arising 
from these specific exclusions, have not been adequately addressed.  
•  Notwithstanding  the  methodological  flaws  and  potential  biases  associated  with  exploratory 
analyses and post hoc exclusion of patients, the results observed from such analyses were of very 
modest  clinical  significance  in  terms  of  overall  survival  or  indeed  any  other  clinically  relevant 
endpoint, and the results lacked consistency across different analyses and subsets. Furthermore, in 
patients  who  were  adequately  pre-treated  with  cisplatin  and  who  represent  the  majority  of  the 
target EU population, vinflunine showed an even lower level of activity compared to those treated 
with non-standard platinum compounds. 
•  Treatment  with  vinflunine  was  associated  with  significant  toxicity  including  severe  or  life-
threatening neutropenia, anaemia, constipation and asthenia/fatigue. Six study drug related deaths 
were  recorded,  in  relation  to  myelosuppression,  septicaemia,  cardio-pulmonary  arrest,  infection 
associated with bone marrow depletion and lethal myocardial infarction. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
(cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority 
decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Javlor  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  or 
metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing 
regimen was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

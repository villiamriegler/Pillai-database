The MAH proposed the extension of indication of Ixiaro to the paediatric segment (2 months of age and 
older) in line with approved PIP EMEA -000559-PIP01-09-M03. Modification of syringe label to include 
"half dose mark" for administration of a 0.25 ml nominal dose for the paediatric sub-segment 2 months 
to below 3 years of age in line with the aforementioned PIP. This change is grouped with the indication 
extension as direct result of the proposed extension. The Package Leaflet and Labelling were proposed to 
be updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 8.2.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
The completed studies, development of marked pre-filled syringe and study IC51-323, are considered 
compliant with the Agency's Decision P/0249/2011) of 25 October 2011. 
This partially completed compliance procedure confirmed the compliance of all those studies contained in 
the agreed paediatric investigation plan that were to be completed by this date. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
IXIARO is licensed in the EU since 31 March 2009. The clinical development program to support licensure 
of IXIARO in adults consisted of 9 studies in which approx. 4,700 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated. 
Currently Ixiaro is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis in adults from 18 years 
onwards. 
JE disease is a potentially debilitating or fatal disease for which there is currently no drug treatment 
available. Children are the most vulnerable population for JE. The mortality rates can go as high as 30% 
of symptomatic cases and around 50% of those who survive have permanent neurological sequale. 
IXIARO is currently indicated only for 18 years and above, hence there is a need for a safe and 
immunogenic vaccine in this vulnerable population (<18 years). 
Intercell received Protocol assistance on the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) of Ixiaro in September 
2007 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/414690/2007). The PIP received initial PDCO opinion and EMA decision in 
January 2010. The PDCO has favourably completed the interim compliance check on 16 May 2012 for 
IXIARO versus the currently effective PIP (EMEA-000559-PIP01-09-M03). 
In accordance with the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) EMEA-000559-PIP01-09-M03 the 
MAH has performed three clinical studies evaluating IXIARO in children.  
In study IC51-221 immunogenicity and safety of different dosages of IXIARO (2 doses of either 0.5 ml or 
0.25 ml given on Day 0 and Day 28) has been compared to the locally licensed comparator vaccine 
JenceVac (a mouse-brain derived, inactivated JE vaccine manufactured by Korean Green Cross) on Days 
0, 7 and 28 in a total of 60 children ≥ 1 to < 3 years of age. The results of study IC51-221 were discussed 
during the PIP agreement. Based on those data the PDCO agreed that no further dose finding was needed 
in children <3 years of age.  
Study IC51-322 was designed to assess the systemic and local safety profile and immunogenicity of 
IXIARO administered in 2 doses in a 28-day interval in a paediatric population (>2 months to 18 years) 
from non-endemic regions. It was planned to recruit 100 subjects, however due to slow recruitment, an 
interim report is provided including data from 60 subjects.  
Study IC51-323 was designed to assess the systemic and local safety profile of IXIARO administered in 2 
doses in a 28-day interval in a paediatric population (>2 months to 18 years) from endemic regions. In a 
subset of subjects immunogenicity of IXIARO was analysed. The study also assessed a potential ‘half 
dose’ or 3µg given in 0.25ml in children ≥3 years to < 12 years. Active comparators used were Prevnar 
and Havrix.

2.2.  Quality  aspects 
The vaccine is supplied as a pre-filled syringe containing a 0.5ml single dose. For children aged 2 months 
to less than 3 years a 0.25ml dose is recommended. As agreed in the approved PIP no separate 
pharmaceutical development has been initiated but half the dose of the syringe filled with 0.5ml is used 
without any alteration to the primary container and filled volume. This half dose is applied by means of a 
printed line and an arrow on the syringe label, the “Half Dose Mark” (HDM).  
The approach was justified by the number of doses marketed. Ixiaro is indicated for active immunisation 
against Japanese encephalitis (JE), which is not endemic in Europe and therefore vaccination is restricted 
to subjects travelling to endemic regions or laboratory workers at risk of exposure to JEV. The overall 
maximum number of estimated doses for the overall paediatric population is far less than one single 
manufacturing lot, and the anticipated number of doses to be used in the age range of 2 months to <3 
years, where the half-dose has to be administered, is therefore estimated to be extremely small. This is 
also confirmed by the enrolment rate in the ongoing paediatric studies conducted in non-endemic 
countries (including EU) which was very low (only 59 children enrolled after 21 months). The number of 
children in the age group over 2 months to less than 3 years is even more limited. 
A number of options for administration of the 0.25ml dose to children <3 years of age were investigated. 
The most appropriate option identified was the application of a 0.25ml mark on the 0.5ml syringe label 
(adult dose). The “half dose mark” (HDM) constitutes a red printed line and an arrow on the syringe label. 
Details on the label are given in figure 1 and figure 2. No other modifications to the label have been 
introduced.

Figure 2: Photograph of syringe with proposed 0.25 ml mark on label  
If a 0.25 ml dose is to be administered, 0.25ml of the 0.5ml vaccine content in the syringe is expelled and 
discarded. This is done by holding the syringe in an upright position and manually expressing the syringe 
plunger until the plunger tip is aligned with the half dose mark indicated on the syringe label. The 
remaining volume of vaccine in the syringe can then be administered. 
Calculation of target extractable volume for half dose 
To assure that the minimum half-dose (0.25 ml) will be achieved, considering the theoretical “worst case” 
tolerance during labelling operation (based on equipment capability), a target extractable volume of 0.34 
ml was calculated. 
Exploratory trial runs  
Test runs were performed. The labelling was performed in accordance with the normal commercial 
labelling process with the exception that the labels used included the HDM and that labelling was 
performed with pre-filled syringes containing a placebo solution. Labelling was initially performed at three 
target positions: 9mm, 10mm and 11mm. A fourth label position (9.5mm) was added following review of 
the initial data. For all four label positions a good correlation of label position and extractable volume was 
demonstrated. The 9.5mm label position provided an extractable volume for the paediatric dosage in line 
with the 0.34ml target and therefore was chosen as the basis for the position of the HDM. 
Qualification (Validation) runs 
Intercell performed Qualification studies on the two labeling machines currently used for commercial 
routine labeling. 
It was demonstrated that both labeling machines consistently applied the label within the specified range 
on to the syringe barrel. This was checked by 100% visual inspection with the IPC gauge. In total, 5,452 
syringes were tested and passed the acceptance criterion on both machines. 
Paediatric extractable volume results were obtained from 300 syringes on both labeling machines. All of 
the syringes tested, resulted in extractable volumes of ≥0.25 ml (range 0.28 ml – 0.39 ml).

Implementation of an in-process control for the Half Dose Mark Label Position for Paediatric Dose 
The Half Dose Mark label position is checked during the labeling operation using a specially designed 
In-process control gauge (IPC gauge). A pre-defined range on the IPC gauge allows direct assessment of 
the correct position of the HDM line relative to the syringe. The IPC gauge is being used in the 
Qualification labelling runs (done with Placebo filled syringes). The exact number of labelled syringes and 
sampling time points used for HDM in-process control checks for the commercial labelling process were 
determined following completion of the qualification runs. 
IPC and acceptance criteria for the half-dose labeling were acceptably defined.  
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
As agreed in the approved PIP no separate pharmaceutical development has been initiated but half the 
dose of the syringe filled with 0.5ml is used without any alteration to the primary container and filled 
volume. This half dose is applied by means of a printed line and an arrow on the syringe label, the ‘Half 
Dose Mark’. The exact position of the HDM on the label was defined in an exploratory study. Results of the 
extractable volume demonstrate that the 9.5mm label position of the HDM ensures that at least 0.25ml 
remains in the syringe.  
Currently qualification and validation studies are performed to verify the results of the exploratory study. 
Qualification data on the labeling of syringes using two different labeling machines demonstrate that 
positioning of the HDM label ensures that a minimum volume of at least 0.25ml remains in the syringe 
after expelling excess vaccine. Labeling by the two machines used (manually and automatic) is 
comparable.  
IPC and acceptance criteria for the half-dose labeling were acceptably defined. The data provided show 
that during routine production the half dose labeling is satisfactorily performed and controlled. The MAH 
is committed to inform about any unexpected results and negative trends observed in the validation runs. 
The variation is in line with the approved PIP which contains the binding requirement “Development of a 
marked pre-filled syringe allowing accurate administration of a half dose”.

2.3.  Immunogenicity /Clinical efficacy aspects  
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted/results 
Three clinical trials conducted in children were submitted to support approval of the paediatric indication 
of Ixiaro, two studies were performed in endemic regions (IC51-221 and IC51-323) and one study is 
currently conducted in non-endemic countries (IC51-322). The study in non-endemic countries is still 
ongoing but an interim report was provided. 
Evaluation of Ixiaro in children in endemic countries 
IC51-221 was an open label phase II trial conducted in a single centre in India to evaluate 
immunogenicity and safety of two doses of Ixiaro in comparison to another JE-vaccine JenceVac. The 
study was performed from July 2007 to October 2007. 
In study IC51-221 a total of 60 healthy children in the age group ≥ 1 to < 3 years were enrolled and were 
randomized in a 2:2:1 allocation ratio. Group I (n=24) received two doses of 3 μg (0.25 ml) Ixiaro, group 
II (n=24) received two doses of 6 μg (0.5 ml) Ixiaro and group III (n=12) received three doses of 0.5 ml 
JenceVac manufactured by Korean Green Cross Vaccine Corporation, Korea.  IXIARO was administered at 
day 0 and 28, while JenceVac, an inactivated mouse-brain derived vaccine, was administered at day 0, 7 
and 28.  Primary endpoint was seroconversion rates measured as neutralising antibodies against the 
IXIARO vaccine strain SA 14-14-2.  Seroconversion was defined as a titre of ≥ 1:10, while zero titres are 
designated the value of 5 for calculations. Secondary endpoints were GMT values and adverse events. 
Out of the 60 subjects enrolled there were more male (61.7%) than female subjects (38.3%). At baseline 
1 subject each in group I and II and none in the JenceVac group (group III) were seropositive for JEV.  
The primary analysis of immunogenicity at day 56 showed seroconversion rates (SCR) of 95.8% in the 
IC51– 3 µg dose group, 95.8% in the IC51– 6 µg dose group and 91.7% in the JenceVac group. There 
were no significant differences in SCRs at day 56 between the groups (Table 1).

A total of 13 adverse events were recorded for all three vaccination groups, most of them were injection 
site tenderness. A total of 2 subjects (1 subject (4.2%) from IC51-6µg dose group and 1 subject (8.3%) 
from JenceVac group) had fever post vaccination. All AEs were mild in severity, and no unexpected 
reactions were observed. There were no clinically significant changes in the laboratory parameters in all 
the groups. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. 
IC51-323 was an open-label, randomized, active-controlled Phase III study to assess the safety of Ixiaro 
(IC51) in children aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years, compared to Havrix 720 and to Prevnar, and to 
establish the immunogenicity of Ixiaro and the appropriate dose (0.25ml or 0.5ml) in children aged ≥ 3 
to <12 years.  
The study was conducted in three centres in the Philippines from March 2010 to July 2011.  Study 
IC51-323 was initially planned to be performed in centres located in the Philippines and Malaysia, but 
conduct of the study in Malaysia was not initiated as the request of the national authorities to use another 
inactivated JEV vaccine as comparator was not feasible for the sponsor.  
No JEV vaccine is currently licensed in the Philippines.  Justification for not using another inactivated JEV 
vaccine as comparator in study IC51-323 was provided and the current study design was agreed in 
discussions of the MAH with PDCO and FDA. 
Study objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the systemic and local safety profile of Ixiaro (IC51), administered in 
2 doses in a 28-day interval, up to Month 7 after the first IC51 vaccination.  
Secondary objectives were defined as follows 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the immunogenicity of Ixiaro in terms of GMTs and SCRs at Day 56  
To establish the appropriate dose (0.25 ml or 0.5 ml) for subjects aged ≥ 3 to < 12 years. 
To assess age-dependent differences in the immunogenicity and safety profile of Ixiaro. 
To assess differences in the safety and immunogenicity profile in subjects with no baseline immunity 
and subjects with pre-existing immunity against JEV and dengue virus (DENV). 
Children and adolescents of good general health were to be enrolled in the study provided they met the 
following eligibility criteria. 
•  Healthy children and adolescents aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years at the time of first vaccination. 
•  Written informed consent provided by the subject’s legal representative(s), according to local 
requirements, and written informed assent of the subject, if applicable. 
• 
Female subjects with either no childbearing potential or, if after onset of menarche, a negative 
pregnancy test and a willingness to practice a reliable method of contraception. 
•  Subjects must not have been vaccinated against JEV, yellow fever, West Nile virus or DENV at any 
time before the study. 
Subjects were randomized as follows: 
•  Subjects aged ≥ 2 months to < 1 year (195 subjects planned, with at least 45 subjects aged less than 
6 months) in a 2:1 ratio to receive IC51 (0.25 ml) or Prevnar (0.5 ml). 
•  Subjects aged ≥ 1 year to < 3 years (852 subjects planned) and ≥ 12 to < 18 years (320 subjects 
planned) in a 3:1 ratio to receive IC51 (0.25 ml if < 3 years and 0.5 ml if ≥ 12 years) or Havrix 720 
(0.5 ml).

• 
For subjects aged ≥ 3 to < 12 years, a dose-finding run-in phase was to be performed involving a 
planned 200 subjects), in parallel to recruitment and study conduct for the other age groups. 
Subjects were to be randomized 1:1 to receive IC51 at a dose of either 0.25 ml or 0.5 ml, and the 
appropriate dose was to be determined based on an interim analysis providing Day 56 (Visit 3) safety 
and immunogenicity results. Immunogenicity data for children with and without pre-existing JEV 
neutralizing antibodies in this group were to be analyzed, and a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
was to review the safety data and recommend whether 1 of the 2 doses was deemed more 
appropriate based on the safety profile. After this run-in phase, 300 further children in this age group 
were to be randomized 2:1 to receive either the appropriate IC51 dose or Havrix 720. 
The study design is summarized in Figure 3. 
Figure 3: Study design 
Criteria of evaluation  
The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
medically-attended AEs until Day 56 after the first vaccination. 
Secondary endpoints were: 
•  GMTs for JEV neutralizing antibodies measured using a validated plaque reduction neutralization test 
(PRNT) and SCR as defined by percentage of subjects with PRNT50 titers of ≥ 1:10 at Days 0 and 56 
and at Month 7. 
•  Rate of subjects with SAEs and medically-attended AEs up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
•  Rate of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs assessed with a subject diary for 7 consecutive 
days after each vaccination (except for Month 7). 
•  Rate of subjects with unsolicited AEs up to Day 56 and up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 9/73 
 
 
  
•  Rate of subjects with abnormal laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) up to 
Day 56 and up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
Analytical tests used for immunogenicity assessment 
To determine JEV neutralizing antibody titers and SCRs, blood samples were to be collected from all 
subjects at Day 0 and, for subjects in the immunogenicity subgroup, at Day 56 and Month 7 or early 
termination visit. Anti-JEV neutralizing antibodies were measured using an validated PRNT assay 
established by Intercell and conducted in the Quality Control Clinical Serology laboratories at Intercell 
Vienna.  
To determine the presence of anti-DENV antibodies local laboratories at the study sites were responsible 
for analyzing these blood samples using the Panbio Dengue Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Indirect 
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to dengue 
antigen serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4).  
Retesting of some samples became necessary as one local laboratory (affecting approx. 650 subjects at 
sites 103 and 104) used the wrong assay until May 2010. It was noted that not all samples could be 
retested as not enough serum was available for all samples.  
Statistical analysis  
Safety 
Only treatment-emergent AEs (commencing after exposure to study vaccine) were included in the AE 
summaries. In all tabulations of AEs, the frequency of subjects experiencing a given AE or AEs from a 
given category, were compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test. An overall summary 
was produced by treatment group and stratified by age group. The summary was repeated stratified by 
pre existing JEV status, and also by pre-existing DENV status. 
The incidence of serious and medically-attended AEs up to Day 56 was analyzed using a logistic 
regression model. Subjects were categorized Yes/No as to whether they had an SAE or 
medically-attended AE, age, pre‐existing immunity against JEV and pre‐existing immunity against 
DENV were fitted as categorical covariates. The odds ratios were presented with 95% CIs for each effect 
in the model. 
Summaries of solicited local AEs (injection site reactions of pain, itching, tenderness, hardening, swelling, 
redness) and solicited systemic AEs (headache, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, excessive fatigue, rash, 
fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, loss of appetite) up to and including Day 6 after each 
vaccination were presented by treatment group and stratified by age group. Percentages were based 
upon subjects who were assessable. 
Immunogenicity 
The number and percentage of subjects achieving a PRNT50 ≥ 10 at Day 0, Day 56 and Month 7 were 
tabulated for each IC51 treatment group along with the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) for the 
percentages. 
The number and percentage of subjects with each of 4- and 10-fold increases in PRNT50 titers at Visit 3 
(Day 56) and Visit 4 (Month 7) were tabulated for each IC51 treatment group along with the 95% 
two-sided CI for the percentages. 
The effect of vaccine dose (0.25 ml versus 0.5 ml) on the SCR, and the 4- and 10-fold increases in PRNT50 
titers at Day 56 and Month 7 were assessed using a Fisher’s exact test. The response variable was a 
binary variable (yes or no) indicating whether a subject had seroconverted. The Mantel-Haenszel type 
risk difference estimator and associated two-sided 95% CIs were also presented. 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 10/73 
  
The raw GMTs and the 95% CIs for the geometric mean were calculated using log10-transformed titres. 
The GMTs were summarized at Day 0, Day 56 and Month 7 by treatment group. The GMT ratio and 95% 
CI for the GMT ratio (IC51 0.5 ml to IC51 0.25 ml) were summarized at Day 56 and Month 7. 
The log titres were analyzed at Day 56 and Month 7 using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with 
covariates including log pre-vaccination PRNT50 titers and center. The anti-log of least square means and 
the estimated ratio between the vaccines were presented along with the 95% CI. 
Subset Analyses: The analyses described above were repeated stratified by pre-existing JEV immunity 
status (seropositive or seronegative at screening) and by pre-existing DENV antibodies status (positive or 
negative). 
Exploratory Analyses: Within each IC51 treatment group, the log titers were analyzed at  Day 56 and 
Month 7 using an analysis of variance, with age as a factor. To assess whether pre-existing immunity to 
JEV influences the post-vaccination titers, the log titers were analyzed at Day 56 and Month 7 using an 
ANCOVA with pre-existing JEV immunity status as a categorical covariate and treatment group as the 
main effect. This was repeated for pre-existing DENV antibodies status. To assess which covariate was 
most strongly associated with the increase in post-vaccination titers, within each IC51 treatment group, 
the log titers were analyzed at Day 56 and Month 7 using an ANCOVA with baseline titer and age as 
covariates and baseline DENV status as the main effect. 
The following study populations were defined 
Safety population: All safety analyses were based on the Safety Population, defined as subjects who 
entered into the study and received at least one vaccination. 
Intent-to-treat Population: The ITT Population was the primary analysis population for the 
immunogenicity analyses and was defined as all subjects randomized into the immunogenicity subgroup, 
who received at least 1 vaccination. Subjects were analyzed according to the treatment group to which 
they were randomized, rather than by the actual vaccine they received. 
Per–protocol Population: Immunogenicity analyses were repeated for the PP Population and excluded any 
randomized subjects who were randomized incorrectly or received the wrong study vaccine or dose were 
considered major protocol deviators and were to be excluded from the PP Population. These and other 
potential protocol deviations were assessed in a data review meeting and classified into major or minor 
protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations resulted in a subject’s withdrawal from the PP analysis. 
Disposition of subjects 
Disposition of subjects is displayed in Figure 4.  
All 1869 subjects who were randomized received at least 1 dose of study vaccine. A total of 1842 subjects 
(98.6%) completed the study and 27 (1.4%) prematurely discontinued. The reasons for discontinuation 
were: consent withdrawn (9 subjects); lost to follow-up (4 subjects); solicited AE (2 subjects, 1 subject 
with vomiting and 1 subject with headache, both events were considered by the investigator to be related 
to study vaccine). One subject (0.1%) had a fatal SAE of disseminated intravascular coagulation; the 
event was considered not related to study vaccine by the investigator. Eleven further subjects (0.6%) 
discontinued for other reasons, the most common was relocating away from the study site.

across the treatment groups. Since age determined disposition of a subject to a treatment group other 
baseline characteristics like weight, height and BMI differ between the two vaccination groups. 
The CHMP noted that in CSR Table 10.2 Demographic data, safety population there must be an error in 
the 0.25 ml dose column: Height, minimum: 19.7 cm, BMI, maximum 206.1 kg/m2. The error seems to 
stem from the subject: 23101311 listed with the following data: weight 8.0 kg, height 19.7 cm, BMI 206.1

kg/m2. The MAH provided information on the investigation of outlying values in height and weight of 
study subjects. It was concluded that these outliers have no significant impact on the average 
demographic data weight, height and BMI. 
A summary of baseline JEV and DENV seropositivity rates was provided for the safety and ITT population. 
Table 4 summarizes the data by age group for the ITT population. Seropositivity for JEV was defined as a 
PRNT50 titer of ≥ 1:10. Seropositivity against DENV was defined by a commercial ELISA.

The CHMP commented that the determination of anti JEV and DENV antibody titers at baseline prior 
vaccination shows that pre-existing maternal antibodies against JEV and DENV are present in a high 
proportion of small children below 6 months (anti-JEV: 30% and anti-DENV: 60%). In children aged 6 to 
<1year no JEV antibodies and in only 10% DENV antibodies were found. In contrast from the age of 1 
year onwards the number of baseline seropositive subjects increases due to natural infection with JEV or 
DENV. The seropositivity rates for JEV for children aged 1 to 3 years were comparable to the rates 
observed in study IC51-221 (3.2% vs 4.2%). The baseline seropositivity rates for children 3 to <12 years 
of age were generally comparable in the two vaccination groups (0.25ml and 0.5ml). Prior vaccination 
12-17% of subjects aged 3-<12 years were found seropositive for JEV and 50-52% were seropositive for 
DENV.  In the age group of the 12 to <18 years old approx. 46% were seropositive for JEV and 74% for 
DENV. 
Immunogenicity evaluation 
A summary of SCRs, fold increase rates and GMTs for the two vaccination groups is presented in Table 5 
for the ITT Population.  
Vaccination with IC51, comprising 2 doses of either 0.25ml or 0.5ml given approximately 28 days apart, 
resulted in high SCRs with 98% in the 0.25ml and 100% in the 0.5ml treatment group post dose 2. 
Four-fold increases in titers were observed in 93.5% and 84.4% of subjects 0.25ml and 0.5ml vaccination 
group, respectively.  Comparable GMTs post dose 2 were determined  for the 2 vaccination groups 
(0.25ml: 199.39 and 0.5ml 190.77).

At Month 7, the immune responses had decreased in both treatment groups with SCRs of 83.9% and 
94.5% in the 0.25 ml and 0.5ml group respectively. Decline in GMTs was more pronounced in the 0.25ml 
group (GMT: 37.99) than the 0.5ml vaccination group (GMT: 64.83).  
Significant differences between the vaccination groups were found for the fold increase rates post dose 2 
and the SCRs at Month 7. 
PP Population results were similar to those of the ITT Population at Day 56 and Month 7.

Stratified by age 
SCRs, fold increase rates and GMTs by treatment group following stratification by age group are given in 
Table 6. SCRs in subjects vaccinated with the 0.25ml dose was 100% in the age group of ≥ 2 months to 
< 1 year, 99.2% in the age group of ≥ 1 year to < 3 years and 95.9% in the group of ≥ 3 years to < 12 
years. For all subjects in the 0.5ml vaccination group stratified by age categories SCRs of 100%  were 
observed. The magnitude of the antibody response in the older age groups within each treatment group 
was generally lower than that in the younger age groups.

For subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years, a GMT of 213.67 and of 113.89 was reported post dose 2 in 
the 0.5ml and 0.25ml dose group respectively. At Month 7 the SCRs observed were 91% and 77.1% for 
the 0.5ml and 0.25ml dose group, respectively. 
In the ITT Population, the only age group in which both doses were administered and therefore could be 
compared was the ≥ 3 years to < 12 years group. After adjustment for a pre-defined covariate of center, 
the estimated ratio between treatments was statistically significant at both Day 56 (1.88-fold higher GMT 
in the IC51 0.5 mL group; p-value <0.001) and Month 7 (1.51-fold higher GMT in the IC51 0.5 mL group; 
p-value 0.009). 
Further analysis of covariance of GMTs by age group (from ANCOVA with center as a covariate) stratified 
by treatment group, age appeared to be significantly associated with a decrease in GMTs. In general, the 
further apart the age group, the more significant the association regardless of treatment group or time 
since vaccination (Figure 5).

Stratified by baseline JEV seropositivity 
A summary of SCR, fold increase rates and GMTs by treatment group stratified by pre-existing JEV 
immunity is presented in Table 7. 
Analysis of covariance for GMTs by pre-existing JEV immunity shows that, there was no significant 
association with pre-existing JEV immunity status at Day 56. At Month 7, the estimated ratio between JEV 
serostatus groups was significant in the 0.25 ml group (GMT was 2.04-fold higher in the seropositive 
group; p-value 0.014) and the 0.5 ml group (GMT was 1.59-fold higher in the seropositive group; p-value 
0.004) indicating a better persistence of antibodies in those subjects who were seropositive at baseline.

immunity is presented in Table 8. 
The analysis of covariance for GMTs stratified by pre-existing DENV antibodies and stratified by treatment 
group at Day 56 revealed that the estimated ratio between pre-existing DENV status was significant in the 
0.25 ml group (0.43-fold lower GMT in the positive group; p-value < 0.001) and the 0.5 ml group 
(0.49-fold lower GMT in the positive group; p-value < 0.001) indicating a greater immune response in 
those subjects who were negative to DENV at baseline. At Month 7 no effect was observed.

Baseline DENV seropositivity seems to negatively impact the antibody responses post dose 2 but not at 
Month 7. 
In order to assess the combined impact of JEV and DENV baseline seropositivity on the immune response 
to the different doses of Ixiaro, the MAH was asked to provide further analyses stratified by JEV+DENV 
baseline immunity as well as stratified by JEV+DENV baseline immunity and stratified in age categories of 
2 months to 1 year, 1-<3 years, 3-<12 years and 12 -<18 years. 
The MAH provided the following analysis: 
Combined impact of JEV+DENV baseline immunity could be interpreted as either comparing subjects who 
tested positive against both viruses with subjects who tested negative against both viruses, or 
alternatively as subjects testing positive for either virus vs. those testing negative for both viruses. Both 
these analyses have been performed and are summarized below. 
•  Subject Disposition According to JEV, DENV and combined JEV / DENV Seropositivity and Age at 
Baseline 
Table 9 provides an overview on the number of subjects per dose group, classified by JEV and DENV 
serostatus at baseline, overall and stratified by age. In the younger children (0.25 ml dose group, < 3 
years) the majority of about two-third of children were seronegative to both viruses while two-third of the 
older children (0.5 ml dose group, > 3 years) were tested seropositive for at least one or both viruses with 
one third positive for both.

Table 9: Subject Disposition Classified by JEV and DENV Serostatus at Baseline, Stratified by 
Age Group, ITT Population, IC51-323 
In line with the known limited specificity of ELISA based assay kits, which may not discriminate between 
cross-reactive antibodies directed against different Flaviviruses, there are very few subjects testing 
positive in the (specific) JEV PRNT assay but negative in the DENV Indirect IgG ELISA (Panbio, AUS). Only 
11 subjects overall were JEV PRNT positive but tested DENV ELISA negative. In contrast, there was a 
significant proportion of about 30% of both dose groups combined that was tested positive in the DENV 
ELISA only but negative in the JEV PRNT, so those subjects may truly have had exposure to DENV only, 
without exposure to JEV.

Impact of JEV and DENV Baseline Seropositivity and Age on the Immune Response to the Different 
Doses of IXIARO 
Following comparison of SCRs and GMTs between subjects who were seronegative for both viruses at 
baseline and subjects being either seropositive for both viruses (“JEV + DENV positive”) or being 
seropositive for at least one of the viruses (“JEV and / or DENV positive”) for the two IXIARO dose groups 
(0.25ml vs 0.5ml) the following observations were made: 
On Day 56, for all age groups combined; 
o 
o 
o 
SCR did not differ substantially between JEV + DENV positive subjects and JEV + DENV 
negative subjects or between JEV and / or DENV positive subjects and JEV + DENV 
negative subjects after either dose of IXIARO.  
GMT was higher in JEV + DENV negative subjects compared to JEV + DENV positive 
subjects and JEV and / or DENV positive subjects after either dose of IXIARO. 
Compared to JEV + DENV positive subjects, JEV and / or DENV positive subjects had a 
slightly lower SCR (100% vs. 95.9%) and lower GMT (approx. 180 vs. 110) in the 0.25 ml 
dose group (which included children aged 3-12 years who received this dose during the 
dose-finding phase). There were no relevant differences in the 0.5 ml group. 
On Month 7, for all age groups combined; 
o 
o 
o 
SCR was higher for JEV + DENV positive subjects and also for JEV and / or DENV positive 
subjects compared to JEV + DENV negative subjects, after either dose of IXIARO. 
In contrast to Day 56, GMT was lower in JEV + DENV negative subjects compared to JEV 
+ DENV positive subjects and JEV and / or DENV positive subjects after either dose of 
IXIARO. 
Compared to JEV + DENV positive subjects, JEV and / or DENV positive subjects also had 
a lower SCR (100% vs. 86.3%) and lower GMT (approx. 79 vs. 42) in the 0.25 ml dose 
group (which included children aged 3-12 years who received this dose during the 
dose-finding phase). There were no relevant differences in the 0.5 ml group. 
In addition further comparisons were presented stratified by age for Day 56 (“JEV + DENV positive” and 
“JEV and / or DENV positive”, Table 10) and Month 7 (“JEV + DENV positive”, and “JEV and / or DENV 
positive”, Table 11).

Immunogenicity analysis stratified by baseline immunity and age can be summarized as follows: 
On Day 56, when stratified by age; 
o  SCR was above 97% in all subgroups examined so did not differ substantially between JEV 
+ DENV positive subjects, JEV and / or DENV positive subjects and JEV + DENV negative 
subjects; with the exemption of 93.9% SCR in the JEV and / or DENV positive subgroup, 
age stratum 3 - < 12 years (i.e. children who received the 0.25 ml dose during dose 
finding). 
o 
In all age and dose groups with a meaningful number of subjects, JEV + DENV negative 
subjects had higher (up to about 2-fold) GMTs compared to JEV + DENV positive subjects 
and JEV and / or DENV positive subjects after either dose of IXIARO; in some age/dose 
group combinations the differences even reach statistical significance as the 95%CI for 
GMT do not overlap. 
o  Within each age stratum, the groups JEV + DENV positive subjects and JEV and / or DENV 
positive subjects had similar GMTs; 
o 
In general, the GMTs decreased with increasing age within each of the baseline JEV/DENV 
status strata; (except for the group aged 3 - < 12 years that received the 0.25 ml dose 
during dose finding and had the lowest titers for obvious reasons). 
At Month 7, when stratified by age; 
o 
In most age and dose groups, SCR was slightly - moderately higher in JEV + DENV positive 
subjects and JEV and / or DENV positive subjects compared to JEV + DENV negative 
subjects. 
o  While data in some age and dose groups are very limited, the JEV + DENV positive 
subjects seemed to retain higher (up to about 3-fold in the group aged 3 - < 12 years that 
received the 0.25 ml dose during dose finding) GMTs compared to JEV + DENV negative 
subjects and higher titers compared to the JEV and / or DENV positive subjects subgroup 
(which did not show relevant differences in GMT compared to the baseline negative 
subjects).  
o 
In general, within each JEV/DENV baseline serostatus stratum, the GMTs remained 
highest in the youngest children followed by the 12 - <18 years group.  
In summary, the MAH asserts that the additional analyses support the findings and conclusions drawn on 
the previous analysis on the impact of baseline JEV seropositivity and DENV seropositivity on 
immunogenicity. Pre-existing JEV immunity appears to lead to lower GMTs shortly after vaccination but 
better persistence of antibodies. The effect on GMT shortly after vaccination is not considered clinically 
relevant, as seroconversion rates i.e. the proportion of subjects that achieve protective titers are high and 
close to 100% in all groups. Additionally, the GMTs are high in both baseline positive and negative 
subjects even though they differ. Lower GMTs seen in baseline positive subjects also underline that the 
results generated in this population from a JEV endemic country does not overestimate the magnitude of 
immune response in non-endemic populations, and if any would represent an underestimate. 
The differences in antibody persistence is regarded of higher practical relevance and studies to determine 
the persistence of antibodies in children from non-endemic areas are ongoing and will be reviewed jointly 
with follow-up data from endemic regions to conclude on duration of protection in western children. 
Following this clarification, the CHMP remarked that the immunogenicity analysis stratified by baseline 
serostatus and age revealed that post dose 2 all JEV/DENV naïve subjects except one in the age group of 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 26/73 
  
the 1-3 years old seroconverted. The GMTs were highest in the youngest age group of the 2-<12 months 
old naïve subjects although only limited data from 19 subjects are available. In the group of the 1-<3 
years a lower GMT of 273 was achieved than in the group below 1 year of age. This GMT is comparable to 
the GMT of 332.1 reported in study IC51-322 for the ITT population and well above the accepted 
seroprotective titer of 1:10. 
Antibody persistence data up to 6 Month after the last dose further indicate that in JEV/DENV naïve 
subjects the neutralizing response declines slightly faster than in JEV/DENV seropositive subjects. 
Evaluation of Ixiaro in children from non-endemic countries 
IC51-322 is an ongoing uncontrolled, open-label Phase 3 study to assess immunogenicity and safety of 
Ixiaro in healthy children aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years planning to travel to countries where JEV is 
endemic and JE vaccination would be recommended.  
The study is conducted in 11 centres in USA, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Australia. The study plan 
foresees that 100 healthy children were to be enrolled, but so far only 60 subjects were treated with 
Ixiaro, because recruitment has been slower than expected. Upon request of US FDA, an interim report 
was prepared covering the period of February 2010 to September 2011. This report was submitted to 
support the extension of the age indication of Ixiaro. 
The study was designed to bridge the data obtained from clinical studies with Ixiaro in endemic 
populations to populations which do not have natural exposure to JEV. Subjects included in the study had 
to be healthy children and adolescents aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years at the time of the first vaccination. 
The subject must be planning to travel to an area where JEV is endemic after completion of the 
vaccination schedule. Exposure to JE should be avoided until 1 week after the second IC51 dose and 
subjects should return from travel to JE endemic areas before the Month 7 visit. The planned travel to JE 
endemic areas should not interfere with the study visits and can take place between Days 35 and 56 or 
between Day 56 and Month 7. 
The age cut-off of 2 months has been chosen to meet the PIP requirements. The doses (0.25 or 0.5 ml) 
to be investigated in this study were based on the results of study IC51-221 and IC51-323.  
In study IC51-322 subjects were to receive Ixiaro as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Two injections of Ixiaro 0.25 ml (3µg), intramuscularly, at Day 0 and Day 28 for subjects aged ≥ 2 
months to < 3 years (half the adult dose). 
Two injections of Ixiaro 0.5 ml (6µg), intramuscularly, at Day 0 and Day 28 for subjects aged ≥ 3 
years to < 12 years (the appropriate dose for this age group based on the findings of Study 
IC51-323). 
Two injections of Ixiaro 0.5 ml (6µg), intramuscularly, at Day 0 and Day 28 for subjects aged ≥ 12 
years to < 18 years (full adult dose). 
The study design is displayed below.

Three different commercial vaccine lots were used during the study: JEV08K16A, JEV09K35A and 
JEV10H62A.  
Study objectives 
The primary study objective is the assessment of immunogenicity by determination of SCRs and GMTs at 
Day56. Secondary objectives are defined as assessment of the safety profile and of the differences in the 
immunogenicity and safety profile in subjects depending on age groups, dose groups, TBE vaccination 
history and travel to JE endemic areas. 
Endpoints for the Interim Analysis 
The co-primary endpoints in the study are: SCRs as defined by percentage of subjects with PRNT50 titers 
of ≥ 1:10 at Day 56 and GMTs for JEV neutralizing antibodies measured using a validated PRNT50 assay 
at Day 56. 
Secondary endpoints were: 
•  SCRs and GMTs at Day 56 and Month 7 stratified according to dose groups, age groups, TBE 
vaccination history, travel to JE endemic areas, travel to JE endemic areas before Day 56, as well as 
travel to JE endemic areas after Day 56. 
•  Rate of subjects with SAEs and medically-attended AEs up to Day 56 and up to Month 7 after the first 
vaccination. 
•  Rate of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs assessed with a subject diary for 7 consecutive 
days after each vaccination. 
•  Rate of subjects with unsolicited AEs up to Day 56 and up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
Statistical analyses 
For the immunogenicity analyses the number and percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion at Day 
0, Day 56 and Month 7 were tabulated for each Ixiaro dose group, and for both dose groups combined, 
along with the 95% 2-sided confidence intervals (CI) for the percentages. The raw GMTs and the 95% CIs 
for the geometric mean were calculated using log10-transformed titers. The log titers were analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance, with region as a covariate. The descriptive statistics were repeated 
stratified by dose group and age group. The effect of region on the immune response was analyzed by 
analysis of covariance on the log PRNT50 titers.

For safety analyses treatment-emergent AEs were summarized. In all tabulations of AEs, the frequencies 
of subjects experiencing a given AE or AEs from a given category were compared between dose groups 
using Fisher’s exact test. The effect of age on the SAE or medically-attended AE rate, AE rate and the rate 
of related AEs was analyzed by logistic regression. Results from physical examinations, and vital signs 
and body temperature measurements were listed only. 
The following populations were analysed: 
Safety Population comprised all subjects who entered into the study and received at least 1 vaccination. 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population for the interim analysis comprised all subjects with a Visit 3 that occurred 
up to and including 15 September 2011. 
Per–protocol (PP) Population was based on the ITT Population but excluded any subjects who were major 
protocol deviators. 
Interim results 
At the data cut-off point, 28 subjects had been recruited from Europe, 26 subjects from North America 
and 6 subjects from Australia. The subjects received at least 1 dose of Ixiaro (IC51) and a total of 53 
subjects had completed visit 3 and 22 subjects had completed the study. One subject withdrew consent 
and discontinued prematurely from the study. 
The baseline characteristic by dose group is given in table 12. The mean age of subjects was 1.5 years 
(median 1.06; range 0.9 to 2.9 years) for the half dose vaccination group and 13.49 (median 15.49; 
range 3.4 to 17.9 years) for the full dose group. Most subjects were Caucasian (83.3%). The proportion 
of females (56.7%) was greater than males (43.3%).

Analysis was performed by dose and age group. Table 13 and Table 14 display the various populations 
analysed. 
Out of the 60 subjects enrolled, 54 subjects were included in the ITT population and 25 in the PP 
population. The low number of subjects included in the PP population is mostly due to major protocol 
violations identified as temperature excursions for the study vaccine (21 subjects; 38.9%) and prohibited 
medication or vaccination (7 subjects; 13.0%).

Immunogenicity results 
A summary of SCRs and GMTs at Day 0, Day 56 and Month 7 is presented in Table 15 for the ITT 
Population. 
Table 15: Geometric Mean Titers and Seroconversion Rates by Dose Group, ITT Population 
The GMT was slightly higher in the PP Population (483.91 [95% CI: 300.46 to 779.36]) at 
Day 56 (Visit 3) than in the ITT Population for the 0.5 ml group. 
Further analysis of GMTs stratified by age group and travel to endemic areas were performed. Post dose 
2, GMT in the ≥ 2 months to < 3 years age group was 216.18 (95% CI: 105.97 to 441.00); in the ≥ 3 to 
< 12 years group was 498.78 (95% CI: 201.80 to 1232.77); and in the ≥ 12 to < 18 years group was 
292.26 (95% CI: 225.74 to 378.39). While GMTs were similar in the youngest and oldest group at Day 56, 
the wide 95% CI in the middle age group would suggest the mean titer for that group should be treated 
with caution. This was due to a single extremely high PRNT50 titer of 7380 in Subject 22205010, a 
7.1-year-old female.  
CHMP commented that there is a large difference in number of subjects between ITT (54 subjects) and PP 
(25 subjects) populations. As much as 54% of the subjects had a major protocol violation. This was 
mainly due to unsatisfactory monitoring of temperature during storage of study vaccine (39% of 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report

Page 31/73 
 
 
  
subjects) and use of another medicine/vaccine (13% of subjects). While emphasis has been on 
presenting immunogenicity results in the ITT population, the possible impact of using a vaccine which 
could be of lower quality due to exposure to extreme temperature was not discussed.  It is reported that 
the GMT values of the PP population (GMT 483) was higher than for the ITT population (GMT 332).  
The MAH thoroughly discussed the consequences of inappropriate temperature excursions (including 
excursions of -1.7°C for 24 hours or up to 16°C for 1 hour) and provided further immunogenicity analysis 
specific for the group of vaccinees having received such vaccine doses (TDP).  
The MAH asserted that it is important to note that the sample size of the overall study and hence the PP 
population was limited. It is therefore probable that due to the low number of subjects the differences 
between ITT and PP population did not reach statistical significance (see Table 16) as seen by the large 
degree in overlap of 95% CI’s for GMT. The true GMT for the PP population is likely to be between 300 and 
780, which would include the 332 observed in the ITT population. Additionally, the lowest and highest 
observed individual PRNT titer was found in subjects from the PP population, i.e. a subject who received 
study vaccine stored under the correct conditions between 2-8°C.

A total of 36 subjects (66.7%) were associated with at least one protocol deviation/violation up to the 
data cut-off date of the interim report. Of these, 29 subjects (53.7%) were excluded from the PP 
population due to major protocol deviations/violations. The most frequently reported major 
deviations/violations were temperature excursions involving study vaccine administered to 21 subjects 
(38.9%). 
The temperature excursions occurred at 6 study centers and in most cases were the result of the vaccine 
storage temperature not being monitored using a minimum or maximum thermometer, so it was not 
possible to confirm that the temperature had been kept within the required temperature range during 
storage. The storage temperature deviations ranged from short-term excursions where the product was 
exposed to high temperatures e.g. up to 16°C for 1 hour; to conditions where monitoring was inadequate 
over longer time periods (e.g. minimum/maximum thermometers not used) and where intermittent, 
documented spikes in storage temperatures outside the required 2-8°C conditions were estimated to 
have occurred for periods of between 12-24 hours. 
•  Antibody Titers in Subjects with Temperature Deviations 
Table 17 summarizes the results comparing the GMT measured for PP subjects and the Temperature 
Deviations Population (TDP). This comparison shows that the sample sizes of the TDP and PP populations 
are very limited with only 22 for the PP and 21 for the TDP. The 95% CI for GMT in the PP and TDP 
population overlap. Again, not only the highest but also the lowest observed individual PRNT titer was 
found in a subject from the PP population, i.e. a subject received study vaccine stored under the correct 
conditions between 2-8°C.

All subjects in the TDP group seroconverted and a GMT of 253 was determined which is numerically lower 
as for the PP population (484). However for five subjects exceptionally high titers were reported in the PP 
group. For one subject having received two vaccine doses stored below 0°C a neutralizing antibody titer 
of 532 was measured. All subjects in the TDP group had at least a titer of 100, which is well above the 
accepted neutralizing cut-off titer of 1:10. Since such temperature excursions might also happen 
regularly in routine practice, the immunogenicity data derived from the ITT population are quite valuable 
as they most likely reflect antibody titers, which could be expected in the field. 
It was noted that the MAH took immediate corrective and preventive actions upon notice of inappropriate 
vaccine storage. 
Although the study aimed to recruit 100 children, it has not been possible to complete the recruitment 
goal in the 35 months since first study initiation in December 2009, despite considerable efforts and 
multiple study locations on three continents. 
As of 18 October 2012, Intercell has only been able to recruit 95 children (which mirrors the low projected 
use of IXIARO in the pediatric segment). If recruitment into the study continues at a comparable rate, it 
is projected that the last subject would be enrolled at approximately end of February 2013; resulting in 
Last Subject Last Visit in September 2013 and the availability of a final CSR in Q2 2014.  
No further interim analysis is planned. As the study design has changed (approved PIP Modification 
Request EMEA-000559-PIP01-09-M03) and serological samples are no longer collected, the extent of 
additional immunogenicity data that would become available from an interim analysis is very limited.  
Further information provided during assessment on concerns raised by CHMP 
o  The low number immunogenicity data from children < 1 year, 25 subjects from endemic 
region (Philippines) and 3 from non-endemic region (Europe) is a concern.  
The MAH discussed how one can be confident that the measured immune response is representative for 
healthy children of that age group in endemic as well as non-endemic regions. 
It is acknowledged that the amount of immunogenicity data from children below one year of age is 
limited. Nonetheless, Intercell is convinced that the available data are sufficient to judge immunogenicity 
and conclude that IXIARO has a favorable risk benefit profile for the prevention of a potentially deadly or 
debilitating disease in that age group. 
Following considerations were provided:

• 
The seroconversion rate in IC51-323 in children < 1 year of age was 100%, or 28 of 28 subjects. 
While the N is indeed low, the resulting 95% CI for the SCR of 87.8-100.1 shows that there is a 95% 
probability that the SCR is at least about 88%. Even if on hypothesized that the vaccine’s SCR was 
really only 88% in the children < 1 year and the risk-benefit profile would be evaluated based on this 
rate, the vaccine would probably still be acceptable. In the case of JEV vaccine, seroconversion rate 
is synonymous with seroprotection rate as the cut-off titer of 1:10 in the neutralization assay (PRNT) 
is accepted to represent a protective titer. There are other licensed traveler’s vaccines which offer 
protection in that range, e.g. against Cholera (Dukoral SmPC: 85% Protective Efficacy (95%CI: 56 - 
95). 
•  Not only the SCR is high, but also the rate of subject with at least 4- or 10-fold increases in titers is 
at comparably high levels, 96.4% for both (95%CI: 83.4 - 98.3), the highest rate observed in any age 
group for 10-fold increase; underlining that the immune response in this age group is very 
pronounced. 
•  Of all age groups investigated, GMT was highest in the children < 1 year of age. As the number of 
subjects is limited, the confidence intervals for the GMT are wider than in an ideal situation where no 
recruitment concerns exist and higher sample sizes can be obtained. However, while the “true” GMT 
in this age group may not have been precisely established, even the lower bound of the confidence 
interval for GMT (284 to 740) in that age group is higher than the GMT in any other age group, again 
demonstrating a very profound immune response to vaccination with IXIARO in the children below 1 
year of age. In addition, a titer of 10 is considered protective, and the limited precision of the GMT 
may not be a concern with respect to clinical relevance, as even the lower boundary of the 95%CI is 
at a magnitude 28 times above this cut-off. 
•  With respect to generalizability of results obtained in a JEV endemic population, reference is made to 
the response to Questions 7 and 12 which discuss in more detail that the clinically most relevant 
outcome measure, seroconversion i.e. seroprotection rates, were constantly seen not to be 
influenced by pre-existing immunity on Day 56 
The CHMP commented that although limited data are available in children below 1 year of age there is no 
indication that the vaccine is not immunogenic in this age group. All subjects seroconverted and high 
GMTs were observed across the studies. 
o  While authorization is sought in Europe, the main paediatric study was performed in the 
Philippines, an endemic country. European population immunogenicity data are available 
from only 51 children between 2 months and 18 years as reported in the interim report from 
an on-going study. From the study in Philippines, immunogenicity data are available from 496 
children. The MAH should elaborate to what extent the immunogenicity data from an endemic 
area (Philippines) applies to Europe, a non-endemic region. 
The MAH responded that several factors may influence the applicability of data generated in one 
population to another population, e.g. age, ethnicity, socio-economic factors; but the factor most 
prominent in the present study is certainly the pre-existing immunity against JEV and DENV that has been 
observed in the Philippines study population but is not expected to exist in European travelers. The study 
thus had pre-defined endpoints addressing these factors, i.e. immunogenicity analysis stratified by JEV 
and DENV baseline status, and by age. In addition, further post-hoc analyses were performed, in which 
immunogenicity was analyzed separately for subjects who were baseline negative for both JEV and DENV, 
resulting in a subgroup that from an immunological standpoint should be most comparable to the 
situation in naïve, European pediatric travelers. Table 18 summarizes immunogenicity on Day 56 
stratified by age, for the JEV+DENV positive and JEV+DENV negative subjects from IC51-323, as well as 
for subjects from IC51-322. 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 34/73 
  
SCR on Day 56 was not impacted by baseline JEV or DENV serostatus and was high in both studies, all age 
groups and all subjects regardless of their Flavivirus status at baseline. As seroconversion in the case of 
JEV vaccine translates to seroprotection, this observation is considered to have the highest clinical 
relevance. 
Subjects who were classified as “seropositive“ for either JEV, DENV, JEV+DENV or JEV and/or DENV 
tended to have lower titers shortly after vaccination i.e. on Day 56 compared to seronegative subjects in 
study IC51-323. Thus, a previously hypothesized memory response in pre-exposed subjects obviously 
did not occur. The results generated in an endemic population therefore do not overestimate the 
magnitude of immune response one would see in non-endemic population, if any it would represent an 
underestimate which certainly would be less of a concern. 
Accordingly, when the subjects who were negative to both JEV+DEN are compared to the respective 
results in subjects in study IC51-322, it appears that titers in IC51-322 are slightly higher where the 
sample sizes permit interpretation. (Note there was one subject with an extremely high titer of over 7000 
in study IC51-322 in the age group 3- <12 years in which GMT is considerably higher compared to 
JEV+DENV negative subjects in IC51-323; see also response to Question 1). Especially in the 
adolescents, with 35 subjects the largest age group in study IC51-322, GMTs between the two groups are 
fairly similar at about 240 (IC51-323 JEV/DENV negative subgroup) and 290 (IC51-322).

Study IC51-323 Stratified by Pre-existing JEV and DENV Serostatus and by Age Group, 
Intent-to-treat Population 
At Month 7, persistence of immunity appeared to be better in most age and dose groups with SCRs 
slightly - moderately higher in those groups that contained a significant proportion of JEV positive

subjects (i.e. subgroups “seropositive“ for JEV, JEV+DENV or JEV and/or DENV). A similar effect has been 
demonstrated in adults where prior or concomitant TBE vaccination has been found to impact duration of 
protection (IC51-303 study report Month 60; submitted as FUM). As duration of protection was found to 
be lower in a study that was conducted in an entirely TBE-naïve population, IC51-305 submitted as part 
of variation II-005, the booster recommendation for IXIARO in adults was set based on that lower 
estimate. Currently, the Month 7 immunogenicity results in study IC51-323 cannot be contrasted to 
results from the non-endemic population in IC51-322 in a meaningful way, as only 18 children completed 
that study to the Month 7 time point at the time of the interim analysis. However the data are awaited to 
conclude on antibody persistence in western populations. 
Apart from differing Flavivirus immunity status, ethnic factors could also limit the applicability of data 
generated in the Philippines to the European pediatric population. Ethnicity has been a factor that has 
been investigated in the licensure trial in adults for IXIARO, IC51-301. Stratified analysis did not reveal 
any difference in the immune response to IXIARO (and neither to JE-VAX) at Day 56, with GMTs and SCRs 
generally similar across different ethnicities (Caucasian, Black or African American, Asian and Other).  
Albeit the number of subjects was limited, the immunogenicity results for persons with Asian background 
observed in study IC51-301 do not indicate an impaired immune response to the vaccine as compared to 
Caucasians or a difference in response patters to IXIARO and JE-VAX. At Day 56, GMTs and SCRs were 
generally similar across different races (Caucasian, Black or African American, Asian and Other) in both 
the IXIARO® and JE-VAX® groups (study IC51-301, post hoc analyses) (Table 19). 
Table 19: Seroconversion Rates and Geometric Mean Titers At Day 56 Stratified by Ethnic 
Origin: Per Protocol Population (Study IC51-301) 
In conclusion, immunogenicity in Flavivirus naïve (i.e. DENV and JEV negative) subjects from study 
IC51-323 conducted in the Philippines and immunogenicity in Flavivirus-naïve subjects from trial 
IC51-322 conducted in Europe, US and Australia appear to be well comparable; and analysis based on the 
entire study population in IC51-323 would also not result in an overestimation of the response in children 
in non-endemic settings as pre-existing Flavivirus immunity appears to lead to lower titers.  
In addition, findings from adults that the immune response to IXIARO is not influenced by ethnicity may 
be extrapolated to the pediatric population.

o 
Interaction between IXIARO and other travel vaccines has not been studied in children. As 
more than one travel vaccine is often administered, the presence or absence of interactions 
should be known. The absence of data on interaction in children should be justified. Further 
vaccine interaction studies in the appropriate age groups, especially in young children should 
be considered. 
The MAH responded that the interaction between IXIARO and other travel vaccines was and is being 
studied in adults. One trial found that there was no interference with the immune response to either 
vaccine when IXIARO was given with Hepatitis A vaccine (HAVRIX). Two further studies are ongoing 
which investigate whether there are any interactions of IXIARO when administered with Meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine and Rabies vaccine. A further study which will study concomitant or consecutive 
administration of IXIARO with Hepatitis A and B vaccine and injectable Typhoid vaccine is planned. The 
MAH asserts that results from these trials in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population, as 
underlying immunological mechanisms of interference – if any - would probably not differ substantially 
between children (at least for those with matured immune system e.g. approximately from ages above 1 
year on) and adults. It is acknowledged that extrapolation of data from adults to the very young age 
groups (infants, toddlers below 1 year) should be applied with lower confidence as for older children; on 
the other hand interference between vaccine components of pediatric combination vaccines have been 
studied extensively in this age group. While differences in the magnitude of antibody responses were 
found for some antigens (n.b., comparing administration of combined product with concomitant 
administrations of single components) those were not clinically significant due to generally high 
seroresponse rates or titers in infants (e.g., Guerra et al, 2009). 
It is acknowledged that more than one travel vaccine may be given to children, as is the case for adults. 
However, the feasibility of conducting interference studies that are adequately sized to obtain meaningful 
data in that particular very young age group is considered virtually impossible as recruitment experience 
from study IC51-322 has shown - reflecting very low projected use of IXIARO (and consequently any 
co-vaccination with IXIARO even lower) in the very young age group. 
With respect to possible combinations, Rabies vaccine is considered the most important concomitantly 
administered vaccine, because the profile of travelers who are recommended JE and Rabies pre-exposure 
prophylaxis overlap in many aspects (e.g. prolonged rural exposure, hiking, farming, hunting, camping 
etc.). Interference between IXIARO and Rabipur (Rabies vaccine) is currently under investigation in 
adults. 
Other vaccines that may be important to travelers are Hepatitis A and B Virus vaccines. For adults, it has 
been demonstrated that Hepatitis A vaccine does not interfere with the response to IXIARO or vice versa. 
A study investigating interference between Hepatitis B vaccine and IXIARO in adults is in planning stage. 
Intercell expects that concomitant administration with Hepatitis B vaccine will be of limited relevance for 
medical care of pediatric travelers, since by 2004 the majority of European member states had introduced 
Hepatitis B vaccination the routine childhood vaccination programs. 
Routine pediatric vaccines would be the only vaccines for which interaction data could not be derived from 
adults. These vaccines however are given at very young ages, making it unlikely that concomitant 
administration with IXIARO will be common, as travel itineraries for which JEV vaccine is recommended 
are very unlikely to be undertaken with infants. 
The CHMP concluded that the MAH provided information about ongoing or planned studies on concomitant 
use with other travelers’ vaccines. It is acknowledged that any concomitant use study in very young 
children is most likely not feasible.

o  The current indication is restricted to adults. There is no discussion on the relevance of the 
recommendations for a booster dose to children that received a primary vaccination from the 
age of two months. The MAH should discuss the need for a booster dose to children of 
different age categories, especially the youngest ones, and plans to establish 
recommendations for a booster vaccine. 
As with other inactivated viral vaccines and as in adults, the MAH expects a booster dose in children to 
become necessary for IXIARO. However, the optimal timing of a booster may not be the same for children 
as for adults, especially when considering that the initial immune response to the primary schedule is 
considerably higher in children, especially in the younger age groups.  These initially higher titers might 
result in a longer interval until titers decline below the protective threshold in a relevant fraction of 
vaccinees, so potentially a booster dose may be required at a later time point for certain age groups. 
While the limited currently available data show that the antibody titers decline considerably in all age 
groups (as expected), the protection rates observed in studies IC51-323 and -322 at Month 7 still remain 
substantial, again especially in the youngest age groups (< 1 of age); pointing to a good persistence of 
immunity in children (see Table 20). However, in the absence of long-term follow-up data from JEV 
non-endemic regions it would be premature to conclude on a booster recommendation. 
Table 20 Persistence of neutralizing antibodies against IXIARO: Adult and Pediatric Clinical 
studies 
The MAH and PDCO have agreed on study plans to establish a booster recommendation for IXIARO in 
children during the PIP procedure. Specifically, two trials were agreed on and are proceeding; both are 
follow-up studies of children enrolled in the pivotal studies IC51-323 / Philippines and IC51-322 / 
Non-endemic countries. Brief outlines of these studies are provided below:

Clinical Studies on Antibody Persistence and Booster in Children: 
IC51-324: 
This is an uncontrolled, open-label Phase 3 study including subjects aged ≥ 9 months to < 21 years who 
have completed study IC51-322 in the immunogenicity subgroup. Safety and immunogenicity follow-up 
visits will take place at 12, 24, and 36 months after first vaccination in study IC51-322. Subjects will be 
withdrawn from the study as soon as their neutralizing antibody titers are known to be negative. No 
formal hypothesis testing will be performed. Study IC51-324 is currently ongoing. Recruitment has been 
completed and a total of 23 subjects could be enrolled into this study. This study will provide information 
on the duration of protection after primary vaccination with IXIARO in children, in a JEV non-endemic 
setting. As the children in this study are not at risk of JEV infection after their initial travel, no booster 
doses were administered. 
IC51-325: 
This is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 study including children aged ≥9 months to <17 years and 7 
months (at the time of enrolment into IC51-325) who have been vaccinated with IXIARO (two 
vaccinations) in study IC51-323. Only subjects receiving the confirmed dose in the dose-finding run-in 
phase of study IC51-323 will be included in IC51-325. A total of 300 children will be recruited stratified by 
age and randomized 1:1 into two groups. One group will be followed for 36 months after the first IXIARO 
vaccination in study IC51-323 (Non-booster Group) to evaluate the long-term immunity and safety. The 
second group will receive a booster dose of IXIARO at 12 months after the first IXIARO vaccination 
(Booster Group) and will be followed for another 24 months to evaluate the booster response and 
long-term immunity and the safety profile of a booster dose. 
The IXIARO dose administered for boosting depends on the age of the subject at the visit at which the 
booster dose is given. Subjects aged ≥14 months to <3 years (at the respective study visit) will receive 
a 0.25 ml dose; subjects aged ≥3 years to ≤18 years will receive a dose of 0.5 ml. Study IC51-325 is 
currently ongoing, recruitment has been completed. The final study report from an interim analysis 
carried out 1 month after the booster will become available over the next months. 
Plans to Establish A Pediatric Booster Recommendation: 
To determine the appropriate timing for a booster dose in children, a review of results from multiple 
clinical trials, focusing on duration of protection after priming in JEV endemic settings (potential of natural 
boosting) and non-endemic settings and on the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose will be 
required: 
• 
Immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose in children: These data will be provided by Study 
IC51-325 
•  Antibody persistence in children after primary immunization: A small cohort of children from JEV 
non-endemic regions is being followed-up in study IC51-324; a larger cohort of children is being 
followed in study IC51-325 but these are children from JEV endemic areas. 
• 
Further supportive data on antibody persistence for 6 months after the completed primary schedule, 
in JEV non-endemic settings, will become available with the final study report of study IC51-322. The 
presently submitted Interim Analysis only includes data from a total of 18 children followed up to 
Month 7. 
The CHMP commented that it is noted that antibody persistence and booster studies are performed in 
children and adolescents as agreed with PDCO. Two follow-up studies are currently ongoing. The MAH will 
provide the antibody persistence/booster data of both studies and plans to update the product 
Ixiaro

information afterwards This is deemed to be acceptable. Nonetheless the MAH is asked to provide the 
interim report for study IC51-325 as soon as this is available (1Q2013). 
o  The MAH should discuss if the immune response in infants and the youngest children is 
expected to cover a broad range of strains from different genotypes as demonstrated in 
adults. Potentially, there could be a difference in cross-reactivity in response between naïve 
subjects and exposed subjects. The MAH should justify the lack of data on cross-reactivity 
with other JEV strains in the youngest children. 
Based on the responses provided by the MAH, the CHMP remarked that indeed following marketing 
authorization, the MAH presented data on cross-neutralization experiments using different genotypes 
(Genotype 1-4) and recent isolates (Genotype 1 and 3). In these experiments it was confirmed that sera 
from adult vaccinees having received two doses of Ixiaro were capable to neutralize all six JEV strains 
tested regardless of the genotype of the strain or whether the strain was recently isolated (Ref. FUM017, 
March 2010). Indeed, there is no indication or reason to assume that the neutralizing antibody response 
elicited by Ixiaro differs in adult subjects and children. Current available data does not suggest that other 
inactivated JEV vaccines induce diverging neutralizing antibody responses in different age categories. 
o  There is little information submitted on the use of other inactivated JEV vaccines in children 
from 2 months of age on a global basis. As there is no JEV vaccine used as a comparator to 
the youngest children (< 1 year) in the studies, information on recommendations for dosing 
and booster doses to the youngest children for other licensed vaccines would be supportive 
and should be provided. 
The MAH asserts that vaccination against JEV is not routinely performed at ages below 12 months in 
South-East Asia. WHO even recommends to not vaccinate children less than 6 months of age, on the one 
hand because the incidence of JE is very low in infants, and on the other hand because interference with 
maternal antibodies was a theoretical concern by WHO. 
Based on review of available information, relatively little information from the current use of JE vaccines 
in Asia may be directly applicable to IXIARO used as a paediatric traveller’s vaccine, due to the different 
routes of administration, schedules and vaccine technologies (no adjuvants in the inactivated vaccines 
used widely in Asia to date). However, it appears that both the use of a half antigen dose in children below 
the age of 3 years and a schedule of two initial doses followed by a third dose after approximately one 
year, similar to the primary schedule and booster dose of IXIARO in adults, are basic concepts in the 
prevention of JE through inactivated vaccines in the JEV endemic regions. 
CHMP concludes that the MAH’s review shows that JEV vaccines are not approved in children below 6 
months of age in countries endemic for JEV and most countries recommend it from the age of 1 year 
onwards.

2.3.2.  Discussion on immunogenicity /clinical efficacy 
Results of three clinical trials conducted in children and adolescents were submitted to support approval 
of the paediatric indication of Ixiaro; two studies were performed in endemic regions (IC51-221 and 
IC51-323) and one study is performed in non-endemic countries (IC51-322). The study in non-endemic 
countries is still ongoing but an interim report was available. 
Study IC51-221 was a phase 2 study designed to identify and establish the optimal dose in healthy 
children aged 1 to 3 years in comparison to the licensed inactivated vaccine JEV vaccine JenceVac. This 
study was performed in India, where JEV is endemic. The immunogenicity results demonstrated that the 
SCRs and GMTs obtained with the two dose levels of Ixiaro (0.25ml/3µg and 0.5ml/6µg) were similar and 
that both dose levels of Ixiaro induced antibody responses comparable to the active comparator 
JenceVac. In conclusion the 0.25ml vaccine dose was found to elicit high SCRs and acceptable GMT levels 
post dose 2 in children aged 1 to 3 years. Based on these study data the PDCO agreed that no further dose 
finding study was needed in children <3 years of age. 
The second study conducted in JEV endemic regions IC51-323 was designed to assess the safety of Ixiaro 
in children aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years in comparison to two licensed vaccines, Havrix 720 and 
Prevnar. Additional objective of this study was to evaluate two different dosages of Ixiaro (0.25ml or 
0.5ml) in children aged ≥ 3 to <12 years, in order to define appropriate dosing regimens with respect to 
safety and immunogenicity. The study was conducted only in study centres in the Philippines, although it 
was initially planned to include centres in Malaysia as well. Conduct of the study in Malaysia was however 
not initiated as the request of the national authorities to use another inactivated JEV vaccine as 
comparator seemed not feasible.  According to the study report, no JEV vaccine is licensed in the 
Philippines.  Although, JEV is endemic in that country, the MAH provided satisfactory justification for the 
lack of JEV vaccine as a comparator included in study IC51-323.  
The determination of anti JEV and DENV antibody titers at baseline prior vaccination shows that 
pre-existing maternal antibodies against JEV and DENV are present in a high proportion of small children 
below 6 months (anti-JEV: 30% and anti-DENV: 60%), while in children aged 6 months to <1year no JEV 
antibodies and in only 10% DENV antibodies were found. In contrast from the age of 1 year onwards the 
number of baseline seropositive subjects increases due to natural infection with JEV or DENV. The 
seropositivity rates for JEV for children aged 1 to <3 years were comparable to the rates observed in 
study IC51-221 (3.2% vs 4.2%). The baseline seropositivity rates for children 3 to <12 years of age were 
generally comparable in the two vaccination groups (0.25ml and 0.5ml) and 12-17% of subjects were 
found seropositive for JEV prior vaccination and 50-52% were seropositive for DENV.  In the age group of 
the 12 to <18 years old approx. 46% were seropositive for JEV and 74% for DENV. 
The immunogenicity results of study IC51-323 demonstrate high immune response rates post dose 2 for 
both treatment groups with SCRs of 98-100% and GMTs of 190-199. This results must be cautiously 
interpreted since the outcome of the immunogenicity analysis by treatment group is impacted by the fact 
that the study design allows overlapping age categories, i.e. the age group of the 3 to <12 year olds 
received either 0.5ml or 0.25ml. Therefore further immunogenicity analyses stratified by treatment group 
and age were provided.  Moreover a significant difference in the antibody levels was observed following 
administration of either 0.25ml or 0.5ml vaccine. Children receiving the half dose (0.25ml) had lower 
GMTs post dose 2 and at month 7 (113.89 and 28.76) compared to children receiving the full vaccine dose 
(213.67 and 43.60). At Month 7 only 77.1% of children in the half dose group had neutralizing antibody 
titers ≥1:10, while a SCR of 91.0% was reported in children in the ‘full dose’ group. Since the baseline 
characteristics, especially as regards JEV and DENV seropositivity, were comparable for both vaccination 
Ixiaro

groups, the difference in the magnitude of the immune response is deemed to result from the higher 
antigen dose and is not due to cross-reactive factors.  
In conclusion for the age group of 3 to <12 years old the immunogenicity data clearly demonstrate that 
the ‘full dose’ regimen elicits higher neutralising antibody responses than the ‘half dose’ regimen and thus 
the full-dose regimen is recommended for this age category.   
In the age group of the 1 to <3 years old a SCR of 99.2% and a GMT of 258.9 was reported at day 56, 
which confirms the results of the phase II study IC51-221 for the 0.25ml vaccine dose. At month 7, the 
neutralising antibody titres declined and a SCR of 85.5% and GMT of 38.91 were determined. With 
respect to persistence of neutralising antibodies, it is currently uncertain whether this age group might 
benefit from a higher vaccine dose as no 6-month antibody persistence data are available for the 0.5ml 
dose group. 
All infants aged 2 months to <1 year had neutralising antibody titres of ≥1:10 post dose 2 and at Month 
7. The GMTs declined from 457.93 at day 56 to 88.6 at month 7. A high proportion of these children, 
especially the 2 to 6 months old had pre-existing immunity against JEV and DENV most likely due to 
persisting maternal antibodies, which might impact the magnitude of the immune response post dose 2.     
Since no information on a booster vaccination is available, the robustness of the immune responses in 
children and adolescents cannot be finally assessed. Results from booster vaccinations in adult subjects 
indicate however that the immune response can be “boostered” in subjects with low or no detectable 
antibody levels up to 24 month following the primary vaccination series. The MAH discussed the need for 
a booster dose to children of different age categories. 
The analysis stratified by baseline JEV antibody status shows, that all seronegative children and 
adolescents from 3 to <18 years receiving the full vaccine dose regimen (IC51 2x0.5ml) seroconverted 
post dose 2. The GMT observed at day 56 was 203 for baseline seronegative subjects, which is in the 
same range as previously reported for adults from non-endemic countries. At Month 7 a SCR of 92.4% 
and a GMT of 52.8 were measured for subjects without pre-existing JEV immunity. Baseline DENV 
seropositivity seems to negatively impact the antibody responses post dose 2 but not at Month 7.  
In order to assess the combined impact of JEV and DENV baseline seropositivity on the immune response 
to the different doses of Ixiaro the MAH was asked to provide further analyses stratified by JEV+DENV 
baseline immunity as well as stratified by JEV+DENV baseline immunity and stratified in age categories of 
2 months to 1 year, 1-<3 years, 3-<12 years and 12 -<18 years.  
Although limited, the available immunogenicity data indicate that Ixiaro is highly immunogenic in children 
and adolescents. Immunogenicity analysis stratified by baseline serostatus and age revealed that post 
dose 2 all JEV/DENV naïve subjects except one in the age group of the 1-3 years old seroconverted. The 
GMTs were highest in the youngest age group of the 2-<12 months old naïve subjects although only data 
from 19 subjects are available. In the group of the 1-<3 years a lower GMT of 273 was achieved than in 
the group below 1 year of age. This GMT is comparable to the GMT of 332.1 reported in study IC51-322 
for the ITT population and well above the accepted seroprotective titer of 1:10.  
Following marketing authorization the MAH presented data on cross-neutralization experiments using 
different genotypes (Genotype 1-4) and recent isolates (Genotype 1 and 3). In these experiments it was 
confirmed that sera from adult vaccinees having received two doses of Ixiaro were capable to neutralize 
all six JEV strains tested regardless of the genotype of the strain or whether the strain was recently 
isolated (Ref. FUM017, March 2010). Indeed there is no indication or reason to assume that the 
neutralizing antibody response elicited by Ixiaro differs in adult subjects and children. Currently available 
data do not suggest that other inactivated JEV vaccines induce diverging neutralizing antibody responses 
in different age categories. 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report

Page 42/73 
  
Antibody persistence data up to 6 months after the last dose further indicate that in JEV/DENV naïve 
subjects the neutralizing response declines slightly faster than in JEV seropositive subjects. As stated, 
studies to evaluate antibody persistence and booster doses are currently ongoing and an interim report 
on IC51-325 is available during 1Q2013.   
Further information was provided on studies investigating concomitant use with Ixiaro.  
2.4.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
IC51-221 
A seven-day follow-up (day 0 to day 6) of solicited local and general adverse events was performed by the 
subject’s parents / legal representative/guardian post 60 minutes after vaccination. Data concerning the 
following adverse experiences were solicited using subject diary and case report form (Table 21).

• 
 Injection site reactions: injection site pain, itching, tenderness, hardening, swelling, redness 
•  Systemic tolerability: headache, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, excessive fatigue, rash, fever 
(measured), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, loss of appetite 
Additionally, the following information was collected: symptoms present after Day 6 (yes/no), last day of 
symptoms (date). There was the possibility to add other unsolicited symptoms of local and/or systemic 
AEs as free text.

The primary endpoint was the rate of subjects with SAEs and medically-attended AEs up to Day 56 in the 
treatment groups Ixiaro (IC51), HAVRIX 720 and Prevnar, i.e., 4 weeks after the completed primary 
immunization. For evaluating the secondary endpoints of the study the following safety data were 
collected: 
•  Rate of subjects with SAEs and medically-attended AEs up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
•  Rate of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs assessed with a subject diary for 7 consecutive 
days after each vaccination (except for Month 7). 
•  Rate of subjects with unsolicited AEs up to Day 56 and up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
•  Rate of subjects with abnormal laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) up to 
Day 56 and up to Month 7 after the first vaccination. 
Subjects had to be children and adolescents of good general health aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years at the 
time of the first vaccination. If female, the subject was to have either no childbearing potential or, if after 
menarche, a negative pregnancy test and willingness to practice a reliable method of contraception. 
Subjects must not have been vaccinated against JEV, yellow fever, West Nile virus or DENV at any time 
before the study. 
2.4.2.  Results 
IC51-221 
All 60 subjects randomised received at least one dose. Thereof, 58 subjects received all doses of study 
vaccine as per protocol. i.e., 24 subjects in IC51 – 3µg dose group, 22 subjects in IC51 – 6µg dose group 
and 12 subjects in JenceVac group received all doses of study vaccine. No subjects were withdrawn from 
the study. 
Table 22 summarizes all adverse events, which were observed during the study. 
Table 22: Overview of adverse events in children aged 1-<3 years of age in study IC51-221 
In total 13 AEs were reported by 12 subjects, all AEs were mild in nature. Injection site tenderness was 
most frequently reported from all three vaccination groups. Overall more adverse events were reported 
from subjects, who received JenceVac compared to both dose groups of Ixiaro. No differences in reporting 
frequencies of adverse events were observed between the two dose groups of Ixiaro. No serious adverse 
events were reported during the study.

Laboratory Values Over Time 
During the course of the entire study, there were no clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters 
or for urinalysis for any enrolled subject. No abnormalities were observed for vital signs within the course 
of the study. 
IC51-322 (Interim Analysis) 
At the time of data cut-off, 60 subjects (100.0%) had been administered 1 vaccination and 56 of those 
subjects (93.3%) had been administered a second vaccination. 53 subjects (88.3 %) had completed Visit 
3 (Day 56) and 22 subjects (36.7%) had completed the study at Visit 4 (Month7). Verified diary data for 
the 7 days after the first vaccination were available for analysis for 59 subjects (98.3%) and for the 7 days 
after the second vaccination for 52 subjects (92.9%). 
Only treatment-emergent AEs are presented, i.e., those AEs that started on or after Day 0. 
In the safety results, ‘Day 56’ refers to data collected at Visit 3 rather than a strict cut-off of 56 days after 
dosing; likewise ‘Month 7’ refers to data collected at Visit 4. Table 23 shows the disposition of subjects by 
dose group. 
Table 23: Subject disposition by dose group 
In total 5 children in the age of two months to <3 years , 14 children in the age of 3 years to <12 years 
as well as 41 children and adolescents in the age of 12 to <18 years were enrolled. 
Mean age of subjects was 12.50 years (median 15.19; range 0.9 to 17.9 years) for the Safety Population 
and most subjects were Caucasian (83.3%). The proportion of females (56.7%) was greater than males 
(43.3%). No subject (ITT Population) had PRNT50 titers ≥ 1:10 at baseline. 
Solicited adverse events by maximum severity after the first vaccination are shown in Table 24.

Table 24: Solicited adverse events experienced by subjects within 7 days after first 
vaccination 
A total of 34 subjects (56.7%) experienced a solicited local or systemic AE within the 7 days after the first 
vaccination. 
Twenty-three subjects (38.3%) experienced at least 1 solicited local AE. All solicited local AEs were 
classified as Grade 1. The most frequently reported were injection site tenderness (pain upon touching) 
(17 subjects [28.3%]) and injection site pain (pain without touching) (10 subjects [17.5%]). 
Twenty-four subjects (40.0%) experienced at least 1 solicited systemic AE after the first vaccination 
(Table 24). Most solicited systemic AEs were of Grade 1 except for the solicited AEs of nausea, excessive 
fatigue and fever, all of Grade 2 and experienced by 1 subject. These solicited AEs remained at that 
severity for no more than 1 day. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were muscle pain 
(15 subjects [26.3%]) and excessive fatigue (7 subjects [11.7%]). 
After second vaccination fewer subjects (19 subjects [35.2%] experienced a solicited local or systemic 
adverse event within 7 days after the first vaccination. Fifteen subjects (27.8%) experienced at least 1 
solicited local AE. All AEs were Grade 1. 
As after the first vaccination, the most frequently reported solicited local AEs were injection site 
tenderness (12 subjects [22.2%]) and injection site pain (8 subjects [15.7%]). 
Nine subjects (16.7%) experienced at least 1 solicited systemic AE after the second vaccination. The 
majority of AEs were Grade 1. One subject (1.9%) reported Grade 2 irritability. Another subject (1.9%) 
reported Grade 3 headache after the second vaccination and Grade 2 nausea, excessive fatigue and fever 
after the first vaccination. Both AEs of irritability and headache lasted no more than 1 day. 
Unlike after the first vaccination, the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were irritability (3 
subjects [5.6%]) and headache (2 subjects [3.9%]). 
The most frequently reported solicited local AEs after both vaccinations combined were injection site 
tenderness (22 subjects [36.7%]) and injection site pain (14 subjects [24.6%]). The most frequently 
reported solicited systemic AEs after both vaccinations combined were muscle pain (15 subjects 
[26.3%]), excessive fatigue (7 subjects [11.7%]) and fever (4 subjects [6.7%]). 
The CHMP commented that the number of subjects, who received 0.25 ml of the vaccine, is too limited to 
draw any final conclusion on the safety of Ixiaro in small children from non-endemic regions.  Additionally 
Ixiaro

for a better overview of solicited adverse events the MAH should provide a summary of all solicited 
adverse events after both vaccinations to evaluate the frequency or solicited AEs in non-endemic 
countries. 
The MAH provided the requested overview (Table 25) of solicited adverse events after both vaccinations 
of study IC51-322.  
Table 25 
Furthermore the applicant bridged the safety data from populations in JEV endemic countries Protocol 
IC51-323 to the western population, because the adverse event rate of the subjects after vaccination is 
independent on their baseline pre-existing immunity as shown in Table 26. Additionally, the AE rates did 
not differ substantially for the subjects neither for the 0.25 ml nor for the 0.5 mL dose group (all ages 
combined). 
Table 26 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report

In addition to this stratified analysis, covariate analysis were performed to determine the impact of 
treatment group, age, baseline JEV and baseline DENV immunity on safety, and these support the 
findings from the stratified analysis. 
Within the age group ≥ 2 months to < 1 year the AE rate correlated statistically significant with age (OR: 
12.5, p = 0.05, indicating AE rate increasing with age). No such correlation was found for pre-existing 
JEV-status, pre-existing DENV status and vaccine group. 
Table 27 
The CHMP commented that the MAH showed that the safety data generated in JEV endemic countries can 
be extrapolated to the non-endemic western countries. The analyses presented indicate that the AE rates 
are independent of the treatment group or pre-existing immunity of JEV and DENV.  Age was the only 
effect significantly associated with the AE rate to Day 56 in subjects aged ≥ 2 months to < 1 year. Higher 
AE rates were observed in children aged close to 1 year than in the younger children in the age group ≥ 
2 months to < 1 year.  
Unsolicited adverse events up to day 56 are summarized in Table 28 (IC51-322).

Table 28: Unsolicited adverse events to Day 56 
Twelve subjects (20.0%) were reported with unsolicited AEs to Day 56 (Visit 3); all had a maximum 
intensity of mild (Grade 1; 9 subjects [15.0%]) or moderate (Grade 2; 3 subjects [5.0%]). Influenza-like 
illness, pyrexia, asthma, diarrhea and headache (2 subjects [3.3%] each) were the most frequently 
reported AEs. 
Two subjects (3.3%) had unsolicited AEs that were considered to be possibly related to study vaccine. 
Subject 22204001, from the IC51 0.5 mL group, reported cough and oropharyngeal pain (both mild: 
Grade 1) 2 days after the first vaccination. Subject 22515001, from the IC51 0.25 mL group, was 
reported with pruritus and erythematous rash, both mild (Grade 1), 8 days after the first vaccination with 
a duration of 2-3 days. 
A total of 19 subjects (31.7%) were reported with unsolicited AEs to Month 7 (Visit 4) at the time of data 
cut-off. 
The majority of AEs to Month 7 were of mild (13 subjects [21.7%]) or moderate (4 subjects [6.7%]) 
intensity (Grade 1 or 2). One subject (Subject 22413009 from the IC51 0.5 mL group) had a potentially 
life-threatening (Grade 4) AE of type 1 diabetes mellitus (also classified as serious), which was considered 
unlikely related to study vaccine by the investigator.

Serious Adverse Events or Medically-attended Adverse Events 
There were no SAEs reported up to Day 56. Three subjects (5.0%) reported medically-attended AEs to 
Day 56: pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis and asthma. None of these medically-attended AEs was 
considered related to study vaccine by the investigator. All of these AEs were either mild (Grade 1) or 
moderate (Grade 2). 
A total of 6 subjects (10%) reported medically attended AEs and 2 subjects (3.3%) reported SAEs up to 
Month 7 (Visit 4) at the time of the data cut-off. One subject reported a potentially life-threatening (Grade 
4) SAE of type 1 diabetes mellitus, considered unlikely related to study vaccine by the investigator. One 
subject had an SAE of dizziness, which was moderate in intensity (Grade 2) and considered possibly 
related to study vaccine by the investigator. One further subject reported severe (Grade 3) AEs of upper 
abdominal pain, vomiting and dehydration, which were medically-attended and considered not related to 
study vaccine by the investigator. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest are predefined AEs potentially associated with allergy/hypersensitivity 
and neurological disorders. Four subjects (6.7%) had AEs of special interest to Day 56 (Visit 3); all were 
associated with potential allergy/hypersensitivity: 
• 
Two subjects (3.3%) had AEs of asthma: one subject had 2 AEs of asthma, both considered to be not 
related to study vaccine by the investigator, 1 event starting the day after the first vaccination and 
resolving the same day and the second starting 6 months after the second vaccination and resolving 
the same day. One subject had an AE of asthma, considered unlikely related to study vaccine by the 
investigator, starting 9 days after the first vaccination and resolving 12 days later  
•  One subject (1.7%), Subject 22204001, had an AE of contact dermatitis, considered unlikely related 
to study vaccine by the investigator, which started 12 days after the first vaccination and was not 
noted to resolve. 
•  One subject (1.7%), Subject 22515001, had 2 AEs of special interest, pruritus and erythematous 
rash, both considered possibly related to study vaccine by the investigator. Both events started 8 
days after the first vaccination and resolved 2 days later. 
One additional AE of special interest was reported to Month 7 (Visit 4) at the time of data cut-off. The 
subject reported mild (Grade 1) paraesthesia, which was considered unlikely to be related to study 
vaccine by the investigator. The event started more than 4 months after the second vaccination and 
lasted 27 days.

Between Day 56 and study completion (Month 7), 1 fatal SAE of disseminated intravascular coagulation 
was reported for a 12-year-old subject; the event was considered not related to study vaccine by the 
investigator. 
Until Month 7 (Visit 4), a total of 31 subjects (1.9%) had SAEs (total IC51 group 21 subjects [1.6%]; 
HAVRIX 720 group 10 subjects [2.5%]). Medically-attended AEs were reported by 337 subjects (26.3%) 
from the total IC51 group and 101 subjects (25.6%) from the HAVRIX 720 group. 
One subject (0.1%) from the total IC51 group had a SAE that was considered to be related to study 
vaccine by the investigator (no subjects in the HAVRIX 720 group). 
Thirteen subjects (1.0%) from the total IC51 group and 4 subjects (1.0%) from the HAVRIX 720 group 
had medically-attended AEs that were considered to be related to study vaccine by the investigator.

Table 36: Solicited Adverse Events Experienced by Subjects Aged ≥ 2 Months to < 1 Year 
within 7 Days after the First Vaccination by Maximum Severity, Safety Population 
Solicited local adverse events in the population aged ≥  2 Months to < 1 Year 23.2 % (45 of 194) of 
subjects had at least 1 solicited local AE within 7 days after the first vaccination. More subjects 
experienced solicited local AEs in the Prevnar group (31.7 %) compared to the IC51 0.25mL group (19.1 
%), especially regarding Tenderness. The majority of subjects experienced Grade 1 local AEs without 
reporting of Grade 3 or Grade 4 local AEs.  
Solicited systemic AEs were experienced by 37.1% (72 of 194) of subjects and the proportions of subjects 
were similar in the IC51 0.25 mL (35.9% [47 of 131] of subjects) and the Prevnar groups (39.7% [25 of 
63] of subjects). The most frequently reported systemic AEs were fever followed by irritability, diarrhoea 
and rash. Solicited systemic AEs were graded as Grade 1 in the majority of subjects and none as Grade 4 
in the time period of seven days after first vaccination. Three subjects had Grade 3 AEs: 1 subject in the 
IC51 0.25 mL group had Grade 3 diarrhoea and in the Prevnar group 1 subject had Grade 3 fever and 1 
subject had Grade 3 irritability. 
Solicited AEs after second vaccination 
A smaller proportion of subjects experienced solicited local AEs after the second vaccination (10.9% [21 
of 192] subjects than after the first (23.2% [45 of 194]). As observed after the first vaccination, a greater 
proportion of subjects experienced solicited local AEs in the Prevnar group (18.0% [11 of 61] subjects) 
than in the IC51 0.25 mL group (7.6% [10 of 131] subjects); the difference was statistically significant 
(p-value 0.045). The most frequently reported solicited local AE after the second vaccination was 
injection site redness (IC51 0.25 mL, 5.3% [7 of 131]; Prevnar, 16.4% [10 of 61] subjects, the difference 
was statistically significant [p-value 0.026]). Total subjects experiencing other solicited local AEs ranged 
from 0 to 3. All solicited local AEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
Solicited systemic AEs were experienced by a smaller proportion of subjects after the second vaccination 
(25.5% [49 of 192] subjects) than after the first (37.1% [72 of 194]). A greater proportion of subjects 
experienced solicited systemic AEs in the Prevnar group (31.1% [19 of 61] subjects) than in the IC51 
0.25 mL group (22.9% [30 of 131] subjects).

Related unsolicited adverse events 
A summary of AEs to Day 56 that were considered to be related (i.e., possibly or probably related) to 
study vaccine by the investigator is presented in Table 37. 
Table 37: Related Unsolicited Adverse Events to Day 56, Subjects Aged ≥  2 Months to < 1 
Year, Safety Population 
The overall proportion of subjects with related unsolicited AEs was slightly greater in the IC51 0.25 mL 
group (7.6% of subjects) than in the Prevnar group (3.1% of subjects). The most frequently reported 
related AEs overall were ALT and AST increased (2 subjects in the IC51 0.25 mL group and 1 subject in 
the Prevnar group). All the related AEs were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in intensity. 
Proportions of subjects aged ≥ 2 months to < 1 year with unsolicited AEs (related and unrelated to 
vaccination) up to Month 7 were similar in both treatment groups (IC51 0.25 mL group: 77.1% [101 of 
131] subjects; Prevnar group: 81.3% [52 of 64] subjects). 
As seen at Day 56, most of the AEs to Month 7 were infections and infestations. The most frequently 
reported unsolicited AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (47.7% of subjects) and pyrexia (13.8% of 
subjects). Proportions were similar across treatment groups. 
≥ 1 year to < 18 age group 
Solicited adverse events after first vaccination in subjects aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 age group are 
summarized in Tables 38 and 39.

Table 38: Solicited Local Adverse Events Experienced by Subjects Aged ≥ 1 Year to < 18 Years 
within 7 Days after the First Vaccination by Maximum Severity, Safety Population 
In the population aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years solicited local AEs were observed by 13.6 % of subjects 
(227 of 1674), who had at least one solicited local AE within 7 days after the first vaccination. The 
percentage of reported local AEs was slightly higher in the higher dose group of IC51 group compared to 
the lower dose group beside redness, which was reported more often in the lower dose group. 
The frequency of reported local AEs was similar between the Havrix group and the total IC51 group. Most 
frequently was reported injection site pain, injection site tenderness and injection site redness in the 
range from 4.4 % to 7.8 % in both groups. 
Solicited local AEs were classified as Grade 1 in the majority of subjects aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years; no 
Grade 4 solicited local AEs were reported. One subject (IC51 0.5 mL treatment group) was reported as 
having Grade 3 swelling at the injection site. 
Proportions of subjects were similar between treatment groups in subjects aged ≥ 1 year to < 3 years and 
≥ 12 years to < 18 years. In subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years, a greater proportion of subjects in 
the total IC51 group (12.5%) experienced local AEs than in the HAVRIX 720 group (5.9%). The local AEs 
experienced by considerably greater proportions of subjects in the total IC51 group were injection site 
pain and tenderness.

Solicited systemic AEs were experienced by 22.0% of subjects (368 of 1674) aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years 
within 7 days after the first vaccination. The proportions of subjects were similar in the total IC51 (22.8% 
[292 of 1280] subjects) and the HAVRIX 720 groups (19.3% [76 of 394] subjects). The most frequently 
reported systemic AEs were fever, irritability and flu-like symptoms in the range from 3.4 % to 14.5 %. 
More systemic AEs were reported in the lower dose group of IC51 compared to the higher dose group. 
Solicited systemic AEs after the first vaccination were classified as Grade 1 in the majority of subjects 
aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years and no Grade 4 solicited systemic AEs were reported. A total of 23 of 1674 
subjects (1.4%) had Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs. Proportions were similar between groups: total IC51 
group 1.3% of subjects and HAVRIX 720 group 1.5% of subjects. The most frequently reported Grade 3 
AE was fever (14 subjects [1.1%] in the total IC51 group and 5 subjects [1.3%] in the HAVRIX 720 
group). Other Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs across both treatment groups included loss of appetite (3 
subjects [0.2%]), diarrhea and vomiting (2 subjects each [0.1%]), and flu-like symptoms, nausea and 
irritability (1 subject each [0.1%]). 
In the individual age groups, proportions were similar between treatment groups except in those subjects 
aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years. A slightly greater proportion of subjects in the total IC51 group (16.5%) 
experienced systemic AEs than in the HAVRIX720 group (10.9%). 
Solicited adverse events after the second vaccination 
Subjects in the total IC51 group were administered their second vaccination 28 days after the first and 
subjects in the HAVRIX 720 group, 7 months after their first vaccination, i.e., at study completion. For the 
HAVRIX 720 group, solicited AE data for only 60 minutes after the second vaccination are available; hence 
a comparison between the IC51 and HAVRIX 720 treatment groups on the number of subjects with 
solicited AEs after the second vaccination was not meaningful. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
A summary of related AEs (i.e., possibly or probably related) to Day 56 (Visit 3) is presented in Table 40.

Table 40: Related Unsolicited Adverse Events to Day 56 (Visit 3), Subjects Aged ≥ 1 Year to < 
18 Years, Safety Population 
The number of related AEs was higher in the IC51 0.25 mL group compared to the higher dose group and 
the Havrix 720 group. The overall proportion of subjects with related unsolicited AEs up to Visit 3 was 
similar in the IC51 and Havrix 720 groups (3.9 % and 3.8 % of subjects, respectively). The most 
frequently reported related AEs were pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis in both 
vaccine groups. 
The majority of unsolicited AEs (related and unrelated to vaccination) to Month 7 were mild. A total of 59 
of 1674 subjects (3.5%) had AEs with a maximum intensity of severe (Grade 3). Proportions were similar 
in the total IC51 and HAVRIX 720 groups (3.6% [46 of 1280] and 3.3% of subjects [13 of 394], 
respectively). Severe unsolicited AEs included 34 of 1674 subjects (2.0%) with severe infections or 
infestations and 16 of 1674 subjects (1.0%) with severe pyrexia. 
Four of 1674 subjects (0.2%), all from the total IC51 group, had a total of 6 AEs to Month 7 that were 
considered potentially life-threatening (Grade 4) in intensity: pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, bacterial 
meningitis, stillbirth, disseminated intravascular coagulation and Kawasaki’s disease. All were classified 
as serious. Kawasaki’s disease was the only SAE considered related to study vaccine by the investigator. 
Subjects with unsolicited AEs considered related to study vaccine to Month 7 were in the same range as 
to Visit 3.

Dose confirmation in subjects aged 3 to < 12 years 
Within this trial an interim analysis was conducted on 201 children aged 3 to < 12, enrolled in the 
dose-finding part. The children were randomized 1:1 and received two doses 28 days apart of either 0.25 
ml or 0.5 ml. 
Safety was assessed using subject diaries covering 7 days after each vaccination, and by collecting 
unsolicited adverse events (AEs) up to Day 56. There was no significant difference between the two dose 
groups for safety parameters, neither solicited nor unsolicited AEs. Up to Day 56, solicited local AEs were 
reported in 22.8% and 16.0%, solicited systemic AE in 20.8% and 25.0% and unsolicited AE in 39.6% 
and 33.0% of subjects in the 0.5 ml and 0.25 ml dose group, respectively. 
After the first dose, 19% of subjects in the 0.5 ml and 15% of subjects in the 0.25 ml group reported any 
solicited local symptom. The majority of local reactions were mild (grade 1). Injection site pain, 
tenderness, swelling and redness occurred in comparable frequencies (between 4% and 9% for each 
symptom and dose group). There were no significant differences between the two dose groups. The rate 
of local reactions was lower following the second dose. 
After the first dose, 18% of subjects in the 0.5 ml and 17% of subjects in the 0.25 ml group reported any 
solicited systemic symptom. The majority of systemic symptoms were mild (grade 1). Fever (12% in the 
0.5 mL group vs. 15% in the 0.25 mL group) was the dominant symptom, while all other symptoms were 
reported in ≤5% of subjects. There were no significant differences between the two dose groups. The rate 
of systemic reactions was lower following the second dose. 
Overview of solicited adverse events by age group 
For assessing the AE rates in different dose groups, which are added to the SmPC, the figures 6 to 8 
display the rates of subjects with solicited local AEs (1) after both IC51 vaccinations combined by age 
group as well as for the solicited systemic AEs (2 and 3).

vomiting, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms and excessive fatigue) by age group 
Figure 8: Rate of subjects with solicited systemic adverse events (muscle pain, rash, 
headache, loss of appetite, fever and any systemic AE) by age group 
The proportion of subjects experiencing solicited local AEs (i.e., for both doses of IC51 combined) was 
slightly greater in the oldest age group (≥ 12 years to < 18 years). In the ≥ 2 months to < 1 year age 
group, injection site redness was the most frequently reported solicited local AE (20.6% of subjects) after 
both vaccinations of IC51 combined, whereas in the ≥ 12 years to < 18 years age group, injection site 
pain (18.8% of subjects) was the most frequently reported. Proportions of subjects in the middle age 
groups were spread more evenly across a number of solicited local AEs. In the ≥ 1 year to < 3 years age 
group injection site pain (6.3% of subjects) and redness (7.5% of subjects) were the most frequently 
reported and in the ≥ 3 years to < 12 years age group injection site pain (6.4% of subjects) and 
tenderness (5.8% of subjects) the most frequently reported. 
The proportion of subjects experiencing solicited systemic AEs (i.e., for both doses of IC51 combined) 
appeared to decrease with age (≥ 2 months to < 1 year, 46.6% of subjects; ≥ 12 years to < 18 years,

19.2% of subjects; Figure 8). Fever was the most frequently reported solicited systemic AE in all age 
groups (≥ 2 months to < 1 year, 33.6%; ≥ 1 year to < 3 years, 28.0%; ≥ 3 years to < 12 years, 16.3%; 
≥ 12 years to < 18 years, 7.1% of subjects). 
In the ≥ 2 months to < 1 year age group the following solicited AEs were not assessable: 
injection site pain, injection site itching, muscle pain and headache; and only small numbers of subjects 
had assessable symptoms of nausea and flu-like symptoms. In the age groups ≥ 1 year to < 3 years and 
≥ 3 years to < 12 years, not all subjects were old enough to be assessed for AEs of injection site pain, 
itching, muscle pain, headache, nausea and flu-like symptoms. Consequently, it should be noted that 
proportions of subjects could be misleadingly high, e.g., flu-like symptoms reported in 1 of only 2 
assessable subjects meant a proportion of 50%. 
Individual clinically significant abnormalities 
Subjects with clinically significant hematology abnormalities where subject proportions are > 0.2 % at 
any study visit is shown in the Table 41.

Concomitant medication 
The most frequently reported concomitant medications after the first vaccination in all age groups was 
paracetamol and ascorbic acid. The proportions of subjects reporting paracetamol use within 7 days after 
the first vaccination and after the second vaccination of study vaccine are summarized in Table 42.

Based on comments received by CHMP, the AE section has been revised to show adverse event rates 
separately for adults and in the pediatric population, for those age groups who receive the 0.25 ml dose 
and those who receive the 0.5ml dose. 
Deaths 
One death was reported during the study. The subject had a fatal SAE of disseminated intravascular 
coagulation approximately 4 months after his second vaccination. The event was considered to be not 
related by the investigator. 
Serious and Medically-Attended AEs 
The rates of SAEs or medically attended AEs to day 56, the primary endpoint of this study, were similar 
across treatment groups within each age group: 
• 
≥  2 months to < 1 year, IC51 0.25 mL group 38.2% and Prevnar group 42.2%; ≥  1 year to < 3 
years, 
•  ≥ 1 year to < 3 years , IC51 0.25 mL group 26.7% and HAVRIX 720 group 22.1%; 
• 
• 
≥  3 years to < 12 years, IC51 0.25 mL group 7.0%, IC51 0.5 mL group 8.0% and HAVRIX 720 group 
5.9%; 
and ≥  12 years to < 18 years, IC51 0.5 mL group 1.7% and HAVRIX 720 group 3.8%. 
A total of 11 subjects (0.6%) had SAEs up to day 56. Medically-attended AEs were experienced by 77 
subjects (39.5%) in the ≥  2 months to < 1 year group and 262 subjects (15.7%) in the ≥  1 year to < 18 
years age group. Rates were similar across the treatment groups within the breakdown of age groups. 
The most frequently reported SAE to day 56 was febrile convulsions (4 subjects from the ≥ 1 year to < 3 
years age group; 1 subject from the ≥ 2 months to < 1 year age group). None of the SAEs reported to day 
56 were considered related to the study vaccine. The most frequently reported medically-attended AEs in 
populations aged ≥  2 months to < 1 year and ≥  1 year to < 18 years were upper respiratory tract 
infection and gastroenteritis. A total of 21 subjects had medically-attended AEs to day 56 that were 
considered related to any study vaccine by the investigator. 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 65/73 
 
 
  
A total of 34 subjects had SAEs to Month 7 (Visit 4): 1.9% of subjects (31 of 1674) in the ≥ 1 year to < 
18 years age group (20 subjects were aged ≥ 1 year to < 3 years) and 1.5% subjects (3 of 195) in the ≥ 
2 months to < 1 year age group. 
The most frequently reported SAEs to Month 7 were febrile convulsion (8 subjects in the ≥ 1 year to < 18 
years age group; 1 subject in ≥ 2 months to < 1 year age group) and pneumonia (4 subjects in the ≥ 1 
year to < 18 years age group; 2 subjects in the ≥ 2 months to < 1 year age group). One subject (IC51 0.5 
mL group) in the ≥ 3 years to < 12 years age group had an SAE of Kawasaki’s disease that was considered 
possibly related to study vaccine by the investigator, but not within the PSUR#5 assessment. One subject 
(IC51 0.5 mL group) gave birth to a stillborn child more than 1 year after the second vaccination; the 
event of stillbirth was considered not related to study vaccine by the investigator.  
The CHMP commented that safety results of the comparator controlled clinical trial with IC51 of subjects 
aged ≥ 2 months to < 18 years showed similar rates of solicited, unsolicited adverse events as well as for 
SAEs and medically attended AEs in the different age categories. The majority of AEs were mild of 
intensity. The safety profile of IC51 compared to Prevnar appeared to cause fewer local reactions, 
specifically less tenderness and hardening in the age group ≥ 2 months to 1 year. All subjects treated with 
either Havrix 720 or IC51 showed a similar AE profile after vaccination with both 0.25 ml and 0.5 mL 
Ixiaro or Havrix after the first dose. Less AEs were reported after the second dose of IC51. No marked 
changes over time were noted in the laboratory data. Regarding vital signs only changes from baseline 
were observed in increased height and weight, which were acceptable for growing children over a 
7-month period. Both doses of IC51 were well tolerated in JEV endemic pediatric population. 
However CHMP was concerned with a lack of safety data on the use of the commercial prefilled syringe 
with a red line as a mark for half a dose to children < 3 years.  The average volume delivered by this 
device is 0.34 ml, while a volume of 0.25 ml was used in the clinical study in children < 1 year. This 
corresponds to 36% higher dose than used in clinical studies. Also, there is no safety data on a full 0.5 ml 
dose to children < 1 years, which could be injected by accident.   
The MAH asserted that there is currently no indication that higher total amount of the active ingredient 
changes the safety profile in any significant way (Lyons et al 2007 (15), Dubischar-Kastner et al. 2010 
(16), Eder et al.2011 (17)). The somewhat higher total volume of 0.32 to 0.34 ml might in theory be 
implied to cause more severe local reactions. However, when comparing the local reactogenicity profile of 
the 0.25 ml doses vs. the 0.5 ml dose used in other age groups, no significant differences emerge. It may 
therefore be inferred that the local safety profile of the (on average) 0.32 to 0.34 ml dose would be 
comparable. 
Allergic reactions, though rather rare still a concern for vaccines, are not dose dependent. Other reactions 
known for IXIARO – or other vaccines – also appear to be independent of dosage. 
The CHMP accepted the argumentation provided. 
Also, the MAH discussed the feasibility of post-marketing follow-up studies in children, especially under 3 
years of age.  Various difficulties hampering such feasibility were acknowledged by CHMP.  In particular, 
it was agreed that current experience, especially in children below 3 years of age, indicates a very limited 
use in this age group.

2.4.3.  Discussion 
In order to support the extension of the age indication to children from 2 months onwards safety results 
from three clinical trials were submitted. Two studies were conducted in countries, where JEV is endemic 
and one study was initiated in non-endemic countries.  
A Phase II trial was conducted in India with the comparator vaccine JenceVac (IC51-221) and the Phase 
III trial was conducted in the Philippines with Havrix and Prevenar as control (IC51-323). The majority of 
data derive from study IC51-323, in which 1869 subjects aged ≥  2 month to < 18 years were enrolled. 
Different age groups were vaccinated with two different dosages of IC51. The safety analyses indicate 
similar rates of solicited, unsolicited adverse events as well as for SAEs and medically attended AEs in the 
different age categories and a comparable safety profile as the licensed vaccines Havrix and Prevenar. 
There was one case of Kawasaki disease which was considered by the investigator to be possibly related 
to study vaccine, while sponsor considered it unrelated because of no known pathophysiological pathway 
for an inactivated vaccine.  This case was previously discussed in the context of assessment of PSUR#5 
and was considered to be not related. 
Study IC51-322 is currently ongoing and is conducted in non-endemic countries. Only 60 participants 
were enrolled in the ongoing Phase III trial in non-endemic environment prior to the interim analysis. The 
mean age of the participants was 12.5 years at enrolment, which indicates that mostly older adolescents 
were enrolled. The safety database is currently very limited especially for small children. Overall the 
safety profile of the data, does not indicate a high reactogenicity of IXIARO with respect to fever rates or 
other expected adverse reactions. One fatal SAE occurred which was judged to be unrelated to Ixiaro.  
On request from CHMP, the MAH discussed the limited safety database and the feasibility of 
postmarketing studies. The data indicate that the AE rates are independent of the treatment group or 
pre-existing immunity to flaviviruses. Age was the only effect significantly associated with the AE rate to 
Day 56 in subjects aged ≥ 2 months to < 1 year. Due to the very limited projected use in children below 
3 years postmarketing studies are not feasible. 
In conclusion the safety data suggest that Ixiaro is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile in 
children and adolescents.

No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. 
2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI):  
The SPC is updated with changes associated with the pediatric indication.  
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indications” has been revised to include a pediatric licensure down to 2 months 
of age: “IXIARO is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis in adults, adolescents, 
children and infants aged 2 months and older.” This age range is considered justified based on the lower 
age of children included into the pediatric trials and the fact that both safety and immunogenity data are 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 68/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
very favourable for all ages down to 2 months. With regards to immunogenicity, the very youngest 
children below 6 months of age, were able to mount the highest titers following immunization.  
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration / Posology has been updated to include the dosing 
suggested for licensure in the paediatric population:  
Children aged 2 months to less than 3 years: 0.25 ml  
Children aged 3 years and older: 0.5 ml 
This dosing is considered justfied based on pediatric data from the phase 2 trial IC51-221 that 
demonstrated equal GMTs with an 0.5 ml and an 0.25 ml dose in children below 3 years of age, but a 
significantly higher GMT with the 0.5 ml dose in children aged 3 - <12 years in the phase 3 trial IC51-323, 
demonstrating a beneficial effect of a higher dose in this age group. Additionally, for infants and toddlers 
the anterolateral aspect of the thigh has been added as possible location for vaccination. 
The section 4.3 Contraindications has been updated to follow the QRD template format that requires a 
definitive list of excipients to be named under “hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the 
excipients”, instead of referring to “eg, protamine sulfate”. Hence, several excipients have been added 
(formaldehyde, bovine serum albumin, host cell DNA, sodium metabisulphite, host cell protein). 
Section 4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation has been re-organized to follow the QRD template 
requirements. 
Section 4.7  
Effects on ability to drive and use machines has been reworded, based on the QRD 
template.  
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects has been updated to include pediatric safety data. In line with the SPC 
Guideline (NTA, A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics, Rev 2, Sept 2009),  this section first 
describes adverse reactions in adults and the pediatric polulation in general; followed by a display of 
reactions that are observed in higher frequencies in the pediatric population compared to adults or other 
pediatric subsets. As the safety profile in adolescents (aged 12-<18 years) resembled the profile in 
adults, no data are shown separately for this age group. With respect to the classification of ADRs to 
certain frequency categories, the frequency information from study IC51-323, which provides a much 
larger subject pool and thus more precise estimate, have been utilized instead of the less precise numbers 
from study IC51-322.    
In detail,  
•  Nasopharyngits and Rhinitis are suggested to be deleted from the SPC - due to the infectious 
etiology, a causal association with IXIARO vaccination is not considered reasonable. 
•  Decreased Appetite has been added as a common reactions because of the frequency in which it 
was seen in adolescents in study IC51-323. 
•  Vomiting has been reclassified to common (from uncommon) based on the frequency in 
adolescents in study IC51-323. 
•  A combined term for injection site reactions has been introduced, under frequency “common”: 
injection site reactions e.g. hardening, swelling, itchingThis is planned to be a global term for 
grouping of local reactions which will include those injection site reactions that are between 1% 
and <10% in frequency. 
• 
The following ADRs have been selected for display of frequency broken down by age group 
(<1year, 1-<3 years, 3-<12years) in a separate section on the paediatric population: Vomiting, 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 69/73 
 
  
Diarrhoea, Rash, Influenza like illness, Hepatic enzymes increased, Irritability, Loss of appetite, 
Cough, Pyrexia, Injection site redness. These events occurred in higher frequency in at least one 
of the of the subsets of the pediatric population compared to adults.  
Apart from the additions to the SPC ADR section, several AEs judged as related by investigators in the 
pediatric studies are not proposed to be added to the SPC, for reasons specified below.  
The following AEs lack plausibility of a causal association to vaccination, mainly due to their infectious 
etiology:  
•  Bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, viral infection, viral rash, oropharyngeal pain, otorrhoea, 
stomatitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis all have an infectious etiology, hence 
a causal association with IXIARO vaccination is not considered reasonable. 
• 
• 
For Kawasaki's disease, a causal association with IXIARO vaccination is not considered 
reasonable as there is no known pathophysiological pathway for an inactivated vaccine to trigger 
this; additionally the disease is known to occur predominantly in the Asian population in which 
this study was conducted, and there was a long latency period to vaccination. 
For epistaxis, there is no known pathophysiological pathway for an inactivated vaccine to trigger 
this. 
The following ADRs are considered to be sufficiently covered by other ADR terms already included in the 
SPC:  
•  Muscle hemorrhage and vaccination site inflammation are considered covered by injection site 
reactions. 
•  Mucous stools is considered covered by diarrhoea. 
•  Rash papular and rash erythemaous are considered covered by the term rash. 
While none of the febrile seizures in the pediatric studies has been considered related to vaccination by 
the investigators, it is proposed to add information on febrile seizures to the SPC because such reactions 
may be expected after vaccination of small children, and fever has been observed in a proportion of 
children.  
Section 5.1 has been updated to include pediatric safety and immunogenicity data, in accordance with 
the SPC guideline.  
• 
Immunogenicity results have been added from both pediatric trials, IC51-322 and IC51-323. 
Greater detail has been provided for study IC51-323 which contributes the majority of subjects 
with immunogenicity data. Since this population was from an area where JEV is endemic, there 
was considerable baseline immunity against JEVespecially in the oldest (12 to <18 years) age 
group in the study (approximately 40%). To distinguish pre-existing immunity from the 
vaccine-induced immune response, the proportion of subjects achieving an at least 4-fold 
increase in neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination is proposed to be displayed along 
with the seroconversion rates (defined as PRNT50 titer ≥1:10) for this study. 
• 
Pediatric safety data have been added from the larger pediatric study IC51-323: Solicited local 
and systemic AEs are described in tabular form for the major age groups enrolled in this trial. 
Since the data are from a non-US population, the inclusion of comparative safety data from other 
licensed vaccines, (Hepatitis A vaccine / Havrix, 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine / 
Ixiaro  
Assessment report  
EMA/233708/2013 
Page 70/73 
 
  
Prevenar) is considered to be of particular importance and will aid physicians interpretation of the 
safety data.  
Section 6.6 special precautions for disposal and other handling has been updated to provide a 
description for handling the pre-filled syringe for administration of the 0.25 mL dose.  
In the Package Leaflet, the changes described above have also been introduced as appropriate.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested additional amendments to the Product Information: 
The MAH provided a revised product information and the MAH addressed the issues identified.  
The proposal of the MAH to perform a user testing with HCP’s, primarily travel physicians, paediatricians 
and vaccinologists and the outline of such testing are endorsed by CHMP. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
JE disease is a potentially debilitating or fatal disease for which there is no drug treatment available. 
Children are the most vulnerable population for JE. The mortality rates can go as high as 30 % of 
symptomatic cases and around 50 % of those who survive have permanent neurological sequalae. 
Annually over 50,000 cases of JE are reported indicating that it is a considerable public health problem for 
many Asian countries. Serological surveys conducted in countries such as Malaysia, India, Nepal, Korea, 
Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia show that most people living in JE-endemic areas are infected before 
the age of 15 years. It has also been observed that in hyper-endemic areas, half of the JE cases occur 
before the age of 4 years and almost all before the age of 10 years. 
Vaccination against JE remains the single most important control measure. Immunogenicity data from 
children from 2 months onwards having received two doses of Ixiaro 4 weeks apart indicate that the 
vaccine induces high level of neutralizing antibodies in almost all subjects. The highest response is seen 
in children below 3 years of age following administration of half the adult dose. Antibody persistence data 
indicate a decline in the neutralizing antibody levels over a 6 month period with over 85% of subjects 
showing neutralizing antibody titers of 1:10, which is the accepted surrogate marker for protection. 
Although only limited data are available for the very small children, the vaccine is expected to induce a 
high degree of protection against JE disease. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Protection against disease has not been demonstrated.  The evaluation of efficacy is based on measuring 
functional antibodies which is accepted as a surrogate of protection.   
Ixiaro

The persistence of neutralising antibodies beyond 6 months after the second vaccine dose is not known in 
children.  Antibody persistence and booster studies are ongoing and further results will become available 
In Q1 2013.  
Only limited information is available on the interactions between the immune response of IXIARO and 
other travel vaccines. These data are derived from adult subjects only. Further studies on the 
concomitant use of Ixiaro with other travellers’ vaccines (e.g. rabies) are ongoing.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In the main study IC51-323 the safety of IXIARO was compared to Prevnar in children < 1 year and to 
HAVRIX in children from 1 to 18 years. In general solicited AEs that were recorded the first week after 
vaccination were similar concerning proportion of subjects experiencing an AE and the intensity when 
comparing IXIARO with Prevnar and HAVRIX. The Prevnar group had a higher proportion with local 
reactions than IXIARO, while in the age interval 3-12 years the IXIARO group had a higher proportion of 
solicited reactions compared to HAVRIX.  The most frequent solicited reactions were injection site 
redness, tenderness and hardening, fever and irritability.  In the IXIARO < 1 year group fever of grade 1 
(37.7-38.6°C) was observed in 17.6% and fever grade 2 (38.7-39.3°C) in 6.1% of subjects.  
SAEs were similarly distributed among IXIARO and control vaccines and none was considered related to 
study vaccine. 
In summary, unfavourable effects are local and systemic reactions during the first week after 
administration of IXIARO and are according to what is expected for an inactivated viral vaccine. 
There is also a risk of individuals that do not respond satisfactorily to vaccination and may therefore be 
unprotected against disease. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The limited number of children in clinical studies does not allow the frequency of rare and some 
uncommon side effects to be calculated. The safety database in infants (< 1 year of age) is small 
(N=132). 
In the clinical study IC51-323 administration of 0.25 ml IXIARO was performed by filling a tuberculin 
syringe from the commercial prefilled syringe (IXIARO).  Thus, the prefilled syringe with a red mark to 
indicate half a dose has not been tested in clinical trials.  The volume injected to children < 1 year in 
clinical study was probably close to 0.25 ml, while the volume delivered using the prefilled syringe with 
red mark is 0.34 ml (average).  There is a lack of safety data in children < 1 year using a “normal” average 
dose of 0.34 ml or if the full volume of 0.5-0.6 ml in the syringe is accidently injected. 
The main study was performed in the Philippines in an Asian population, while the application relates to 
use in a European population.  There may be some differences in the safety profile according to ethnic 
group.

Balance 
Benefit-risk balance 
Japanese encephalitis is a serious and potentially fatal disease for which there is no treatment available.  
IXIARO induces a high level of neutralising antibodies after a two-dose scheme given 4 weeks apart.  
Based on the level of neutralising antibodies as a surrogate of protection against disease, more than 99% 
of children will be protected 4 weeks after the last dose or more than 85% will be protected 6 months after 
the second dose.  As the unfavourable effects are related to mild and moderate local and systemic 
reactions within the first week after vaccination, the benefit-risk balance is positive for children from 2 
months to 18 years.  
Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk of IXIARO in adolescents and children from 2 months onwards is positive. 
The MAH is asked to provide the interim report for study IC51-325 as soon as it becomes available 
(Q1-2013). 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variations requested 
Type 
B.II.e.6.a 
B.II.e.6.a - Change in any part of the (primary) packaging material not in 
IB 
contact with the finished product formulation - Change that affects the 
product information 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH proposed the extension of indication of Ixiaro to the paediatric segment (2 months of age and 
older) in line with approved PIP EMEA -000559-PIP01-09-M03. Modification of syringe label to include 
"half dose mark" for administration of a 0.25 ml nominal dose for the paediatric sub-segment 2 months 
to below 3 years of age in line with the aforementioned PIP. The latter is grouped with the indication 
extension as direct result of the proposed extension. The Package Leaflet and Labelling were proposed to 
be updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.2. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Janssen-Cilag  International  N.V.  submitted  on  23  November  2016  an  application  for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tremfya, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Tremfya  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  who  are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  complete  and  independent  application.  The  applicant  indicated 
that guselkumab was considered to be a new active substance. 
The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data,  non-
clinical  and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0073/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  not  yet  completed  as  some  measures  were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with 
authorised  orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance guselkumab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be  considered  as  a  new  active  substance,  as  the  applicant  claims  that  it  is  not  a  constituent  of  a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for guselkumab is as follows: 
Tremfya  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  who  are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
Psoriasis is a chronic, non-communicable, painful, immunologically-mediated, disfiguring and disabling 
inflammatory  skin  disease  for  which  there  is  no  cure  and  with  great  negative  impact  on  patients’ 
quality of life (QoL). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Plaque psoriasis affects 2% to 4% of the general population1,2,3,4,5,6. Psoriasis is uncommon before the 
age of 9 years, with a first peak of psoriasis generally occurring after the age of 20 with an increasing 
trend with age until around 60 years, after which the incidence is lower5. 
Approximately  90%  of  those  affected  with  psoriasis  have  plaque  psoriasis7,8,6,  with  20%  having 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with a body surface area (BSA) involvement of >5% 9. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis of psoriasis involves environmental factors and immune dysregulation in genetically-
predisposed individuals10,  11. Substantial evidence indicates that IL-23 plays an important role in innate 
and  adaptive  immune  responses,  and  may  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  psoriasis 
vulgaris12,13,14.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Clinically,  plaque  psoriasis  is  characterized  by  symmetrically  distributed,  well-defined,  sharply 
demarcated,  indurated,  erythematous  plaques  that  are  covered  by  friable,  dry,  white-silvery  scale. 
Areas  of  the  body  that  are  frequently  involved  include  the  scalp,  elbows,  knees,  buttocks,  and 
genitalia. The extent of skin involved varies among affected individuals, and is a primary determinant 
of  severity.  Psoriasis  typically  follows  a  chronic  relapsing  and  remitting  course  around  an  individual’s 
underlying  baseline  severity,  with  flare-ups  occurring  spontaneously  or  during  times  of  illness,  or 
psychological stress. 
Although  psoriasis  is  rarely  life-threatening,  the  psoriatic  lesions  are  often  on  visible  skin  and 
unsightly.  Patients  experience  shedding  of  scale  and  bleeding  from  their  plaques  as  well  as  pain  and 
itching. In addition to these common physical signs and symptoms, patients with moderate to severe 
psoriasis  often  experience  feelings  of  self-consciousness  and  embarrassment,  and  as  a  result,  may 
suffer  depression,  social  isolation,  and  unemployment;  all  factors  which  contribute  to  a  significant 
reduction in overall patient quality of life15. For all of these reasons, the disease often requires chronic 
treatment, particularly for patients with moderate to severe disease. 
In addition to the physical and psychological impact of disease, psoriasis is associated with specific co-
morbidities,  including  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA),  obesity,  diabetes,  cardiovascular  disease,  metabolic 
syndrome,  and  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD)16.  It  is  estimated  that  between  6%  and  42%  of 
psoriasis  patients  develop  PsA17,18,19.  Psoriasis  has  also  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  a 
significantly increased risk of Crohn’s disease (relative risk, 3.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23 to 
6.67),  which  is  especially  pronounced  among  psoriatic  patients  with  concomitant  PsA  (relative  risk, 
6.43, 95% CI 2.04 to 20.32)20. Psoriasis is also associated with an increased risk of occlusive vascular 
disease,  including  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  and  stroke21.  Multiple  cardiovascular  risk  factors  are 
associated  with  psoriasis  (eg,  diabetes  and  obesity)  and  are  more  prevalent  in  severe  disease22, 
though  psoriasis  may  also  be  an  independent  risk  factor  for  MI.  Several  large  epidemiologic  studies 
have further demonstrated an association between the magnitude of cardiovascular risk and severity of 
psoriasis23,24. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The traditional paradigms for the treatment of psoriasis recommend a stepwise approach to treatment 
starting with topical agents, followed by phototherapy, then systemic agents25.

Most  commonly,  a  2-tiered  system  is  recommended,  divided  by  patients  who  are  candidates  for 
localized  therapy  and  should  receive  topical  agents  versus  those  who  are  candidates  for  systemic 
and/or  phototherapy26.  Patients  who  are  candidates  for  systemic  and/or  phototherapy  include  those 
who  have  moderate  to  severe  disease  based  on  the  percentage  of  BSA  involvement  and/or  plaque 
location with associated quality-of-life issues. 
Conventional  systemic  therapies  include  MTX,  acitretin,  and  cyclosporine.  Although  effective,  each  is 
associated  with  significant  toxicities,  particularly  organ  damage  with  long-term  administration,  and 
each agent has recommended limitations for long-term administration. 
Rotational therapy is employed to minimize these significant side effects27, though no evidence exists 
that rotational strategies can lessen the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) 28. 
A  variety  of  biologic  systemic  therapies  have  been  developed  and  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
psoriasis,  including  anti-tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα)  agents  (infliximab,  adalimumab, 
etanercept),  an  IL-12/23  antagonist  (ustekinumab),  and  more  recently,  IL-17A 
inhibitors 
(secukinumab  and  ixekizumab).  These  agents  are  generally  well-tolerated,  and  unlike  conventional 
systemic agents, are not associated with cumulative toxicities that limit longer-term safety. However, 
as  immunomodulatory  agents  they  have  the  potential  to  increase  risk  for  infection  and  malignancy. 
Concerns  for  anti-IL-17  class  agents  also  include  Crohn’s  disease,  neutropenia,  and  mucosal  candida 
infections. 
While conventional and systemic therapeutic modalities are available for the treatment of moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis, most do not provide adequate efficacy to a majority of patients when assessed 
using clinically meaningful endpoints such as an Investigator’s Global assessment (IGA) of cleared (0) 
or minimal (1), and PASI 90 and PASI 10029.  While the response rates of available treatments, 
including those for more stringent measures of efficacy30,31, have increased over time, there is still 
substantial room for improving the proportion of patients that achieve clear skin. In addition, the 
currently available treatments have practical limitations due to tolerability, toxicity, safety risks, and/or 
issues with ease of use or convenience. 
About the product 
Guselkumab  is  a  human  mAb  directed  against  the  p19  subunit  of  IL-23  and  thus,  specifically  targets 
IL-23.  A  rapidly  growing  body  of  literature  suggests  that  the  IL  23/IL-17  pathway  contributes  to  the 
chronic  inflammation  underlying  the  pathophysiology  of  many  immunemediated  diseases,  including 
plaque  psoriasis,  erythrodermic  psoriasis  (EP),  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  (GPP),  palmoplantar 
pustulosis  (PPP),  IBD,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  and  PsA.  Susceptibility  to  psoriasis,  PsA,  and  IBD  has 
been shown to be associated with genetic polymorphisms in IL-23/IL-23R components. 
The proposed indication for guselkumab in the treatment of plaque psoriasis is as follows:

candidates for systemic therapy. 
Guselkumab is administered by subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose is 100 mg at Weeks 0 
and 4, followed by maintenance dosing every 8 weeks. Consideration should be given to discontinuing 
treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This is an application for centralized procedure according to Art. 3(1) (mandatory scope) of Regulation 
(EC) 726/2004, Annex (1) (Biotech medicinal product). 
The application has been submitted in accordance with Art. 8(3) (full application) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 100 mg of guselkumab as active 
substance. Other ingredients are histidine, histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 80, 
sucrose and water for injections.   
Tremfya  is  administered  by  subcutaneous  injection and  is  available  in  a  prefilled  glass  syringe  with  a 
fixed needle and a needle shield, assembled in a needle safety device. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Guselkumab  is  a  fully  human  immunoglobulin  G1  lambda  (IgG1λ)  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that 
neutralizes the biological activities of human cytokine, IL-23. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine, which 
is comprised of 2 protein subunits.  
The mechanism of action of guselkumab is prevention of extracellular IL-23 binding to cell surface IL-
23 receptor (IL-23R). The binding of guselkumab to the IL-23p19 subunit blocks the binding of IL-23 
to  the  IL-23  receptor,  inhibiting  IL-23-specific  intracellular  signalling  and  subsequent  activation  and 
cytokine production.  
The intact molecule contains 2 identical heavy chains (HC) of 447 amino acids (approximately 49 kDa 
each)  and  2  identical  light  chains  (LC)  of  217  amino  acids  (approximate  23  kDa  each).  The  4  chains 
are linked together by covalent disulfide bonds and non-covalent protein-protein interactions. The HC 
and LC amino acid sequences have been provided in the dossier.  The disulfide bonds were predicted 
from  the  expected  pairings  for  a  human  IgG1  antibody  and  confirmed  by  peptide  mapping.  N-linked 
glycans were shown to be bi-antennary structures typical for an IgG1 antibody expressed in CHO cells 
as determined by oligosaccharide mapping with mass spectrometry analysis.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The  manufacture  of  Tremfya  active  substance  represents  a  standard  monoclonal  antibody 
manufacturing.  Tremfya  active  substance  is  manufactured  in  a  process  consisting  of  fed  batch  cell 
culture followed by purification and formulation, which takes place at Biogen (BIIB), Research Triangle 
Park,  NC,  USA,  and  Janssen  Biologics  (Ireland),  Cork,  Ireland  (JBIL).  The  listed  manufacturers  and 
contract laboratories have been qualified to perform manufacturing, storage and control of guselkumab 
active substance in compliance with GMP.  
During the first stages guselkumab is produced by fed batch fermentation in a production bioreactor, 
followed  by  Protein  A  affinity  chromatography,  viral  inactivation  and  neutralization.  The  next  stages 
contain various chromatography steps, virus removal filtration and finally the preparation of the active 
substance.  
Batch  numbering  is  clearly  defined.  The  manufacturing  process  is  clearly  presented  and  in  sufficient 
detail.  Critical  and  non-critical  process  parameters  are  listed  for  all  stages,  together  with  respective 
target  values  and  Proven  Acceptable  Ranges  (PARs).  The  basis  for  establishing  PARs  is  process 
development and/or historical data.  
The  container  and  closure  used  for  storage  and  shipping  meet  the  requirements  of:  USP  <661> 
Physicochemical  Tests  -  Plastics;  USP  <87>  In-vitro  Biological  Reactivity  Tests;  USP  <88>  In-vivo 
Class  VI  Plastics;  Ph.  Eur.  2.6.9,  Abnormal  Toxicity;  Regulation  (EU)  No  10/2011,  Plastic  Materials 
Intended to come into Contact with Food. The silicone liner meets the requirements of Ph. Eur. 3.1.9, 
Silicone  Elastomer  for  Closures  and  Tubing.  The  container  and  closure  system  also  complies  with  the 
European requirements on leachables and extractables outlined in CPMP/QWP/4359/03. 
The containers and  closures are supplied pre-sterilized and gamma irradiated.  Studies demonstrated 
that the container closure system maintains integrity during freezing, storage, shipping, and thawing,   
Controlled  extraction  study  was  performed  on  representative  pre-sterilized  containers.  The  estimated 
maximum daily exposure of the most abundant extractable is less than the safety threshold described 
in ICH M7.  
Control of materials 
The  genes  encoding  for  guselkumab  were  used  to  transfect  CHO  cells.  The  resulting  CHO  cell  line, 
designated as C1707B, was used to produce material for all clinical trials and will be used to produce 
commercial product. Culture media formulations are described and all necessary details are provided.  
A  banking  system  is  used  to  ensure  supply  of  the  production  cell  line.  Tests  used  for  the Master  Cell 
Bank (MCB) are acceptable and in line with the requirements of ICH Q5D and Q5A. Analytical methods 
are  sufficiently  described.  Isoenzyme  analysis  was  also  part  of  the  test  panel.  According  to  the 
certificate of analysis all parameters were compliant.  
The test panel for the Working Cell Bank (WCB) is acceptable and is in line with ICH Q5A. Certificates 
of  analysis  demonstrate  that  the  cell  banks  are  compliant  with  the  requirements.  Preparation  and 
storage of the cell banks are presented in detail, including a protocol for preparation of future WCBs.

Animal-  and  human-derived  components,  used  during  the  generation  of  the  development  cell  banks, 
have been described and are deemed to be acceptable.  
Details  of  compendial  materials  have  been  provided  as  well  as  in-house  specifications  for  non-
compendial materials including buffer components and chromatography resins.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
In-process controls (IPCs), i.e. tests and the associated acceptance criteria, or predefined instructions 
have  been  provided.  These  were  established  based  on  the  control  of  active  substance  critical  quality 
attributes (CQAs) at critical steps and intermediates to ensure product quality and consistency during 
the active substance manufacturing process. The applicant also uses process-monitoring tests (PMTs) 
to  ensure  process  consistency  and  to  add  further  control  on  the  manufacturing  process.  PMTs  have 
either  action  limits  or  predefined  instructions.  The  strategy  applied  by  the  company  is  considered 
acceptable. 
Description of the AVA (in vitro Adventitious Virus Assay) has also been provided.  
Process validation 
The  applicant  provided  a  detailed  and  well  organized  description  of  the  process  validation  and 
evaluation  data,  which  is  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  process  validation  for  the  manufacture  of 
biotechnology-derived  active  substances  and  data  to  be  provided  in  the  regulatory  submission 
(EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014).  
Process validation has been performed. Validation of the reprocessing steps, process hold times, resin 
lifetime  and  control  of  impurities  has  been  presented.  Shipping  was  qualified  using  minimum  and 
maximum  shipping  conditions.  With  regard  to  hold  times,  these  were  established  based  on  extensive 
stability studies.  
Chromatography resin lifetimes were established using qualified scale down models and the proposed 
resin lifetimes are acceptable.  
The proposed hold times have been supported by product quality and microbial control data generated 
using scale down models and using commercial scale material. Microbiological hold time validation was 
performed,  demonstrating  acceptable  microbial  control  during  maximum  hold  times  for  the  active 
substance manufacturing process.  
Process  validation  and  evaluation  studies  confirmed  that  the  applicant  is  capable  of  producing  the 
active  substance  with  consistent  quality,  and  this  is  demonstrated  by  characterization  and  batch 
analysis  results  of  primary  structure,  carbohydrate  structure,  disulphide  bonds,  mass  heterogeneity, 
charge heterogeneity, size heterogeneity and purity, higher order protein structure, and potency.  
Shipping of the active substance has been successfully validated. 
Process development 
A  detailed  description  has  been  provided  on  the  manufacturing  process  development,  including  the 
history of process development at each of the manufacturing stages, comparability studies, an impurity 
risk  evaluation,  process  control  strategy  development,  analytical  history  and  the  description  of  the 
quality management system.  
Details of the changes during development as well as a thorough comparability study according to ICH 
Q5E were presented in the dossier.  
The history of the analytical development has also been provided.

A comprehensive description has been provided about the integrated control strategy applied, that was 
based on identification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) and includes an integrated control of process 
parameters,  material  attributes,  IPCs,  release  and  stability  tests,  process  validation  and  procedural 
control. Prior product knowledge and platform manufacturing experience have also been utilized for the 
development of the control strategy.  
The CQAs are considered relevant for monoclonal antibodies and are controlled through critical process 
parameters, IPCs or at the release specification level. Elements of Quality by Design were used (Design 
of  Experiments  (DoE)  for  several  process  steps)  but  no  regulatory  flexibility  has  been  claimed.  For 
establishing  CPP  PARs,  some  of  the  experiments  were  performed  in  a  multivariate  fashion  wherein 
more than one PAR was investigated at the same time.  
Process related impurities were critically assessed to determine their impact on product safety.  
Characterisation 
The  active  substance  has  been  extensively  characterised  with  respect  of  structure  and  biological 
function.   
The amino acid sequence as expected on the basis of the cDNA sequence was confirmed by adequate 
techniques.  The  known  disulphide  bond  structure  of  the  G1  subclass of  immunoglobulins  has  likewise 
been  confirmed.  The  intact  protein  masses  corresponded  to  the  major  glycoforms.  The  site  of 
glycosylation  on  the  heavy  chain  has  been  identified  and  the  results  of  an  adequate  analysis  of  the 
carbohydrate  side  chain  variants  have  been  presented.  The  targeted  functional  effect  of  guselkumab 
binding  was  demonstrated  by  a  cell  based  assay  where  the  inhibition  of  initial  IL-23R  signaling  was 
quantified. The potency assay reflects the proposed mechanism of action. FcγRI and FcRn binding have 
also  been  demonstrated.  The  structural  and  biological  characterization  of  guselkumab  is  deemed 
satisfactory. 
The  characterization  of  structure/function  relationships  was  used  to  evaluate  the  criticality  of  post-
translational  modifications  (PTMs)  for  guselkumab.  This  approach  helped  identify  critical  points  of 
manufacturing  process  validation  and  analytical  controls  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished 
product.    The  approach  used  for  controlling  the  product  related  variants  and  impurities  is  deemed 
adequate. 
The removal of process related impurities is addressed at the process validation level.  
Specification  
The active substance specification includes tests for colour, pH, identity, charge heterogeneity, purity, 
quantity and microbiological contamination.  
The  Applicant  outlined  the  strategy  followed  in  establishing  the  specifications  and  acceptance  criteria 
and  discussed  how  CQAs  were  controlled  either  at  the  active  substance  specification  or  at  the  in-
process  control  level.  Active  substance  specifications  including  those  of  identity,  colour  of  solution, 
bioburden  and  endotoxin  content  were  based  on  regulatory  requirements.  Other  active  substance 
specifications  were  derived  from  statistical  analysis  of  release  and  stability  results  of  the  active 
substance  batches  used  to  manufacture  Phase  3  clinical  finished  product.  The  approach  followed  is 
deemed reasonable.   
Analytical methods

The  active  substance  specification  allows  adequate  control  of  identity,  purity  and  potency.  For 
assessing  the  biological  activity  a  cell  based  assay  was  developed  which  measures  guselkumab-
mediated inhibition of IL-23 dependent receptor signalling. The assay measures guselkumab bioactivity 
at  the  initiation  of  the  IL-23  signaling  cascade.  The  analytical  tests  and  their  validations  have  been 
described except for bioburden which is a compendial test.  
Batch analysis 
Data  presented  include  batches  of  Phase  3  process  material,  process  validation  batches  and  post-
process  validation  batches.  The  acceptance  criteria  provided  are  the  Phase  3  and  process  validation 
specifications that were in place at the time of release.  
Reference materials 
The first reference material (RM), called Research Reference Material  was prepared from a GMP active 
substance batch and used for testing Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 clinical batches until the first commercial 
process  primary  reference  material  (PRM)  and  working  reference  material  (WRM)  became  available. 
The RRM was qualified using the release tests and additional characterisation methods, which were in 
place at that stage of development. 
PRM  and  WRM    were  qualified  using  routine  release  tests  along  with  additional  characterization 
methods. 
The  procedure  for  the  generation  and  qualification  of  the  future  reference  material  has  been 
adequately described.  
Stability 
Analytical methods used are the same as those used for active substance and finished product testing. 
Samples  subject  to  the  stability  studies  were  stored  in  containers  representative  of  the  intended 
commercial storage containers. 
Stability has been demonstrated based on real time data from Phase 3 Process batches.  
The  stability  data  submitted  generally  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  at  the  recommended  storage 
condition.    The  stability  indicating  parameters  are  acceptable  and  the  stability  monitoring  program 
conforms to ICH Q5C.  
Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Tremfya  finished  product  is  supplied  in  a  single  use  prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  containing  100  mg  active 
substance/syringe.  Composition  of  the  finished  product  is  the  same  as  that  of  active  substance,  i.e. 
100 mg active substance (guselkumab), sucrose, histidine buffer, polysorbate 80.  
The container closure system for the finished product is a sterile, ready to fill 1-ml syringe barrel (clear 
type  I  borosilicate  glass)  with  a  stainless  steel  needle.  Primary  packaging  also  includes  a  latex-free 
rigid needle shield and a rubber plunger stopper which complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 Rubber closures for 
containers for aqueous parenteral preparations for powders and for freeze-dried powders. The syringe 
barrel  and  plunger  stopper  are  siliconized;  data  is  presented  in  the  pharmaceutical  development

section to support acceptably low levels of silicone leaching into the finished product and a specification 
is applied by the supplier to limit levels of silicone in the syringe barrel.  
The  syringes  are  assembled  into  a  passive  needle  guard.  The  needle  guard  is  intended  to  protect 
against  needle-stick  injury  and  automatically  extends  beyond  the  PFS  needle  following  complete 
injection of the PFS contents. 
The excipients are compendial and have been sufficiently described. No excipients of human or animal 
origin and no novel excipients are used in the manufacture of the finished product.  
CQAs  were  discussed  as  part  of  the  manufacturing  process  development;  the  process  and  its  control 
were  developed  based  on  the  quality  target  profile  for  the  product  and  platform  manufacturing 
experience  with  the  pre-filled  syringe  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  facility.  An  integrated  control 
strategy which takes into account parametric controls (including CPPs and appropriate PARs), material 
controls, in-process controls, release/stability testing, characterisation and process validation has been 
presented.  Taken  together  these  control  elements  ensure  that  the  finished  product  will  meet  the 
defined CQAs. A description of the control points for the CQAs relevant to each manufacturing process 
step has been provided.  
The suitability of the container closure system has been adequately justified with reference to potential 
impurities and container closure integrity. The risk of glass delamination is determined to be low on the 
basis  of  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  syringes,  the  finished  product  formulation/recommended 
storage conditions and the absence of terminal sterilisation. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at Cilag AG, Schaffhausen, Switzerland and released at Janssen 
Biologics B.V., Leiden, The Netherlands. 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  includes  thawing  and  pooling  of  active  substance,  pre-
filtration followed by sterile filtration, and finally aseptic filling into syringes. Relevant IPCs have been 
identified and acceptance criteria have been determined.  
CPPs  were  determined  for  the  relevant  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process,  i.e.  sterile  filtration  and 
aseptic filling/stoppering. Proven Acceptable Range (PAR) of the CQAs have been determined.  
The  manufacturing  process  and  process  controls  for  the  assembly  of  the  passive  needle  guard  have 
been described.   
IPC tests are performed by in-line sensors and detectors. Filter integrity and bioburden testing of filters 
as well as aseptic fill-weight and stopper position are controlled as critical steps.  
Manufacturing  process  validation  was  performed  and  all  results  showed  compliance  with  pre-
determined acceptance criteria and commercial release specifications. 
The maximum hold time from active substance thawing up to filling and stoppering was validated.  
Several  phase  3  and  validation  batches  were  tested  to  ensure  that  IPCs  and  their  respective 
acceptance  criteria  are  suitable  to  ensure  that  the  finished  product  conforms  to  its  release 
specifications.  
Needles were tested and results show no adverse effect on the quality of the finished product. Further 
leachables  and  extractables  from  the  container  closure  system  have  been  evaluated  and  no  issues 
identified.  
Assessment report

The finished product shipping includes various shipping configurations that were validated for different 
periods of time and temperature ranges.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  spectifications  include  tests  for  colour,  pH,  osmolality,  turbidity,  particulate 
matter,  polysorbate  80  concentration,  expelled  volume,  identity,  charge  heterogeneity,  purity, 
quantity,  potency,  pyrogens,  microbiological  contamination,  appearance  of  primary  container  and 
glidability.  In  general  the  finished  product  specifications  are  acceptable  and  take  account  of  the 
requirements  of  the  Ph.  Eur.  monographs  for  Parenteral  preparations  and  Monoclonal  antibodies  for 
human use (01/2012:2031).  
Product  related  impurities  were  discussed  in  the  active  substance  section  of  the  dossier  but 
confirmation has been provided that the purity methods for finished product release are adequate for 
their control.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical tests and their validations have been described. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the 100 mg presentation were provided. 
Reference materials 
The reference standards are described in the active substance section. 
Stability of the product 
The  proposed  shelf-life  time  is  24  months  from  the  manufacturing  date  of  the  PFS  and  the 
recommended  storage  temperature  is  2-8  °C.  A  comprehensive  stability  program  was  conducted  for 
the finished product to assess the effects of storage on the quality parameters.  
Overall the proposed shelf life of 24 months at 2-8 °C when the finished product is protected from light 
is sufficiently justified. 
To  test  finished  product  stability  in  a  potential  event  of  temperature  excursions  that  may  be 
encountered during transportation, storage, and handling, a thermal cycle stability test was performed.  
Photostability studies have demonstrated that the finished product is not stable when exposed to light. 
The SmPC consequently includes a statement that the product should be stored in the outer carton in 
order to protect it from light.  
Functionality of the passive needle guard over the proposed shelf life has been demonstrated.    
Adventitious agents 
Animal-derived  materials  were  used  only  during  the  generation  of  the  development  cell  banks,  and 
sufficient information on these materials has been provided. No animal or human derived materials are 
used during the manufacturing process.  
Cell banks were tested for adventitious viruses, the only positive result was for RVLPs.  
Assessment report

Reduced  scale  models  used  in  the  viral-clearance  studies  were  qualified  for  representativeness  of  the 
manufacturing  process.  The  virus  selection  is  considered  acceptable  and  process  samples  were 
evaluated for suitability in the virus detection system. The purification process provides an acceptable 
viral clearance to assure viral safety of the finished product. 
Medical device  
The  passive  needle  guard  is  an  accessory  to  a  glass  PFS  conforming  to  ISO  standards.  It  has  been 
demonstrated  that  the  materials  used  for  the  passive  needle  guard  components  are  not  adversely 
affected by aging or storage conditions.  
2.2.3.  Discussion and conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy to support development of guselkumab for treatment of psoriasis was 
designed and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidance ICH S6 (prior to June 2011) and thereafter ICH S6 (R1) for the preclinical safety evaluation 
of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals and other applicable guidance’s. 
Pivotal  studies  in  the  toxicology  program  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  international  GLP 
regulations.  In  all  GLP  studies,  deviations  from  the  protocol  and  GLPs  were  documented  and  their 
impact on the interpretation of the study was assessed. Exceptions to GLP were described. 
Non-pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with protocols (and amendments where applicable) 
and Standard Operating Procedures consistent with the principles of GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Guselkumab  specifically  binds  to  the  p19  subunit  of  IL-23  with  high  affinity;  it  does  not  bind  to  the 
shared  p40  subunit  of  IL-12  and  IL-23.  Guselkumab  binds  only  to  soluble  IL-23  and  not  to  the 
prebound  molecule.  The  neutralization  of  IL-23  occurs  before  the  binding  of  IL-23  to  its  receptor  IL-
23R.  Consequently,  Fc  portion  of  guselkumab  is  not  able  to  activate  the  complement  dependent 
cytotoxicity. 
Guselkumab  clearly  inhibited  IL-23  induced  phosphorylation  of  STAT3  and  consequently  IL-10 
production  of  NK  cells.  That  shows  that  blocking  IL-23  before  it’s  binding  to  IL-23R  has  significant 
downstream consequences in the immune response. This functional effect was further substantiated by 
the  inhibition  of  IL-17A,  IL-17F  and  IL-22  production  by  mouse  splenocytes  and  IL-17  production  by 
Assessment report

peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMC).  The  in  vitro  activity  of  guselkumab  to  neutralize  IL-23  is 
comparable with that of ustekinumab.  
In the cross-species studies it has been shown that guselkumab can fully inhibit IL-17A production by 
mouse  splenocytes  induced  by  native  human,  guinea  pig,  primate  and  cynomolgus  monkey  IL-23. 
Guselkumab can only partially inhibit canine IL-23 induced IL-17A production and has no effect at all 
on mouse and rat IL-23 induced IL-17A production. Recombinant human, cynomolgus, rat and mouse 
IL-23  showed  similar  sensitivity  to  guselkumab  to  their  native  counterparts,  respectively.  It  was  also 
demonstrated that  guselkumab  can  inhibit  recombinant  cynomolgus  IL-23  induced  IL-17A  and  IL-17F 
production  by  cynomolgus  T  cells.  These  latter  data  suggest  that  guselkumab  might  act  similarly  on 
the  IL-17A  production  by  human  T  cells  as  cynomolgus  monkeys  are  genetically  much  closer  to 
humans than mice. 
Human IL-23 seemed to increase serum levels of several cytokines in mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) 
administration of both recombinant mouse (rm) IL-23 and rhIL-23 to C57BL/6 mice was found to result 
in dose dependent increases in serum levels of IL- 1α, G-CSF, IP-10, TNFα, GM-CSF and MCP-1. 
Guselkumab administration was shown to attenuate rhIL-23 induced increases in serum levels of 
cytokines IL- 1α and G-CSF without any significant change in TNFα, IP-10 or GM-CSF levels. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  in  vivo  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  performed.  Due  to  the  high  specificity  of 
guselkumab demonstrated in the in vitro studies it was deemed unnecessary  to search for secondary 
targets in mice or rats.  
Secondary  pharmacological  in  vitro  studies  investigated  the  tissue  cross  reactivity  of  guselkumab.  A 
non  GLP  study  demonstrated  that  the  biotinylation  of  guselkumab  did  not  appear  to  affect  tissue 
staining  patterns,  and  hence  biotinylated  guselkumab  was  used  for  further  studies.  Tissue  cross 
reactivity studies revealed that biotinylated guselkumab exhibits similar cross tissue reactivity in both 
human and cynomolgus monkey. There was extensive staining of both cardiac and skeletal myocytes 
in both species, the entire cytoplasm of cardiac myocytes was stained while the staining was primarily 
localised in the peripheral cytoplasm of skeletal myocytes.  
Guselkumab  was  not  found  to  bind  to  pig  cardiac  myosin,  pig  muscle  myosin  or  recombinant  human 
myosin  in  a  further  in-vitro  binding  study.  The  similar  patterns  of  cross-reactivity  exhibited  by 
guselkumab  between  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues  provides  further  evidence  of  the 
pharmacological relevance of this species. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A  dedicated  cardiovascular  (CV)  safety  pharmacology  study  was  undertaken  in  telemetered 
cynomolgus  monkeys.  Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  and  respiratory  safety  pharmacology  endpoints 
were  assessed  as  part  of  the  repeat  dose  toxicology  studies  following  5  weeks  i.v.  or  s.c. 
administration. 
Cynomolgus  monkey  was  identified  as  the  pharmacologically  relevant  species  to  assess  the 
cardiovascular  safety  of  guselkumab.  In  the  pivotal  CV  safety  study,  the  generation  of  the  statistical 
analysis summary of the ECG measurements was not GLP compliant; this is not considered to impact 
on the interpretation of these results. Baseline ECG measurements were taken 5 days prior to dosing 
i.v.  with  either  10  or  50  mg/kg  of  guselkumab.  There  were  no  mortalities  or  adverse  clinical

observations following administration. There was a mild (5-12 mmHg) statistically significant decrease 
in mean arterial blood pressure, and periodic significant decreases in HR with corresponding increased 
QT interval in the 50 mg/kg group, these changes were small and not considered biologically relevant 
as they remained within normal range. There was no distribution of guselkumab to cardiac or skeletal 
muscle  detected  via  immunohistochemistry.  The  NOAEL  for  this  study  was  set  at  the  highest  dose 
tested, 50 mg/kg. 
CV  and  respiratory  rate  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  following  administration  of  guselkumab  i.v.  up  to  5 
weeks  and  s.c.  up  to  24  weeks  at  doses  of  10  and  50  mg/kg  were  measured  as  part  of  the  dose 
toxicity study. In this study, there was no qualitative change in ECG parameters recorded at any time 
point or dose level. Statistical analysis of these parameters was not performed. Guselkumab was well 
tolerated  at  all  doses  and  routes  of  administration  and  the  NOAEL  was  set  at  50  mg/kg,  the  highest 
dose tested.  
CNS  related  parameters  assessed  as  part  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  included  clinical 
observations, rectal body temperature and physical examinations of the animals (T-2008-007). There 
were no significant adverse effects on clinical observations at any dose tested. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted. This was considered acceptable by CHMP as 
no  pharmacodynamic  interactions  are  anticipated  with  co-administered  drugs  due  to  the  high 
specificity of guselkumab. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A single-dose SC and IV study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys to assess PK. Repeat dose TK 
was  evaluated  as  part  of  the  toxicology  studies  in  guinea  pigs  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Traditional 
absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  studies  were  not  performed.  Although  the 
metabolic  pathways  of  therapeutic  mAbs  are  unknown,  the  expected  consequence  of  metabolism  of 
biotechnology derived mAbs is the catabolism to small peptides and individual amino acids in the same 
manner  as  endogenous  IgG.  Therefore,  classical  biotransformation  studies  as  performed  for  small 
molecule pharmaceuticals are not needed for therapeutic mAbs (ICH S6 [R1]). 
Guselkumab  concentrations  and  anti-guselkumab  antibodies  were  analysed  from  the  PK/TK  samples 
that were collected from cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig studies. Validated bioanalytical methods 
were used to quantify guselkumab concentrations in cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig serum, and in 
cynomolgus monkey breast milk. Levels of guselkumab in serum and breastmilk or levels of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) against guselkumab in cynomolgous monkey were detected using a DELFIA, an ECLIA 
or  a  bridging  ELISA  respectively.  Levels  of  guselkumab  and  levels  of  ADA  against  guselkumab  in 
guinea  pig  were  detected  using  a  DELFIA  and  an  ECLIA.  In  general,  the  bioanalytical  methods  and 
assay parameters for the quantitation of guselkumab concentrations and detection of anti-guselkumab 
antibodies  were  validated  according  to  criteria  established  in  published  literature  and  validation 
guidance  documents  (DeSilva  et  al.,  2003;  United  States  FDA,  2001).  These  bioanalytical  methods 
evolved as the preclinical development program of guselkumab progressed. All assays are all validated 
and agreed. 
Absorption  was  studied  in  the  two  species  used  for  toxicology  assessment,  the  guinea  pig  and 
cynomolgous monkey. In  guinea pig, the PK/TK profile was studied in the non-GLP 3 weeks repeated 
dose toxicity and in male and female fertility studies. In cynomolgous monkey, the PK/TK profile was

studied  in  the  single  dose  PK  study,  in  the  2  phase  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  and  in  the  ePPND 
study.  As  IL23  is  a  soluble  target,  it  is  expected  that  pharmacokinetics  will  follow  the  normal  FcRN 
mediated  degradation  pathway  of  IgG’s.  Animals  were  dosed  either  once  (cynomolgous  monkey)  or 
twice (guinea pig) a week in contrast to the clinical posology (first two doses 4 weeks apart followed by 
8 week intervals). A result of the more frequent dosing interval in animals, up to 2.8 fold accumulation 
was observed in cynomolgous monkey.  
Guselkumab was immunogenic in both guinea pigs and monkeys, as expected for a human mAb. ADA 
were detected in only 2 (2.2%) of 90 monkeys treated with guselkumab, one after a single 50 mg/kg 
IV  dose  of  guselkumab  and  one  pregnant  female  and  her  infant  in  the  ePPND  study  receiving  10 
mg/kg/week SC guselkumab. One of the monkeys showed accelerated clearance. A higher incidence of 
ADA  was  seen  after  SC  doses  of  guselkumab  to  guinea  pigs,  which  were  administered  twice  weekly. 
83.3% of 66 pregnant and non-pregnant female guinea pigs, 24.7% of 93 male guinea pigs and 19% 
of  32  pooled  foetal  samples  from  guselkumab  treated  pregnant  females  were  ADA  positive.  ADA 
resulted in  accelerated decrease  of  guselkumab  serum  levels  in  only  a  few  ADA  positive  animals,  but 
cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig were sufficiently exposed to observe any potential adverse effects 
of guselkumab. 
As guselkumab is a typical IgG-based mAb (MW 146,613 Da) targeting a soluble target, distribution is 
assumed to be limited to the vascular space with limited distribution to the extracellular space and the 
mean volume of distribution was estimated to be dose independent.  
Maternal / foetal serum guselkumab ratio was determined at GD30, but since placental transfer of IgG 
in the guinea pig is not expected to occur before GD30 (reviewed by Pentsuk and Van der Laan, 2009) 
a conclusion on placental transfer of guselkumab in guinea pig could not be drawn based on the data 
obtained in the female fertility study.  
In  the  ePPND  study,  Cynomolgous  monkey  mean  infant/maternal  serum  concentration  ratio, 
determined at PND28 was 0.83 (50 mg/kg/week). Guselkumab concentrations in PND28 milk samples 
were below the lowest quantifiable concentration for the assay (i.e., <0.20 µg/mL). This is expected, 
since  limited  amount  of  IgG  is  only  excreted  in  the  first  milk  of  cynomolgous  monkey.  It  can  be 
assumed  that  distribution  to  infants  have  been  mainly  a  result  of  FcRN  mediated  placental  transfer 
(reviewed by Pentsuk and Van der Laan, 2009 & Fujimoto K, 1983). 
Similar  to  other  IgG1  mAbs,  guselkumab  is  presumably  eliminated  via  catabolic  pathways  that  are 
typically  associated  with  endogenous  IgG.  As  T1/2  in  infant  monkeys  was  slightly  higher  than  in  the 
female (mother) monkeys it is assumed that clearance in infants is slower.    
It is unlikely that hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism represents a major elimination 
route of guselkumab. In vitro, IL-23 did not alter the expression or activity of multiple CYP enzymes 
(i.e., 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) in cryopreserved human hepatocytes, suggesting that 
potential interactions between guselkumab and CYP substrates are unlikely. Therefore, no nonclinical in 
vivo drug-drug interaction studies to evaluate the effect of guselkumab on other drugs were 
conducted, which was considered acceptable by CHMP.

The tolerability of a single dose of guselkumab was assessed in a non-GLP, non-terminal TK/ADA study 
in  male  cynomolgus  monkeys  by  the  SC  (1,  10  and  50  mg/kg)  and  IV  (50  mg/kg)  routes  of 
administration  (P-2007-255).  In  addition  to  the  TK  and  ADA  endpoints,  body  weights  and  clinical 
observations  were  assessed  throughout  the  57-day  study  interval.  Local  tolerance  to  guselkumab 
administration  was  also  assessed  up  to  72-hours  post-guselkumab  administration.  While  there  were 
some  faecal  changes  in  some  animals  including  a  control  animal,  these  were  not  ascribed  to 
guselkumab  administration.  There  were  no  signs  of  guselkumab-related  toxicity  or  effects  on  local 
tolerance observed during the conduct of this study.

A  non-GLP  3  weeks  repeated  dose  toxicology  study (0,  10,  50  or  100  mg/kg SC  biweekly)  in  Dunkin 
Hartley  Male  Guinea  Pigs, supported  the  use  of this species  for  male  and  female  fertility  studies.  The 
observed  premature  mortality  and  adverse  clinical  signs  noted  during  the  study  were  considered  a 
result  of  the  primary  means  of  blood  collection  (i.e.,  surgically  implanted  catheters  accessing  the 
carotid  artery),  and  thus an  alternate  collection  route  (i.e., the  jugular  vein) was  used  in  subsequent 
studies.

A  GLP,  2-phase  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  was  conducted  in  cynomolgous  monkey.  Once  weekly 
administration of guselkumab via the IV and SC route for 5 weeks (phase 1) or SC 24 weeks (phase 2) 
up to 50 mg/kg revealed no toxicity findings at a Cmax more than 200 fold higher and a mean AUCDay 
161-168  50-fold  higher  compared  to  clinical  Cmax  and  AUCinf  levels  (single  SC  dose  of  100  mg/k). 
According  to  S6R1,  toxicity  testing  of  monoclonal  antibodies  in  animals  up  to  10  fold  in  excess  of 
human exposure levels is already sufficient.  
The applicant has conducted literature search to the role of IL 23 in Coronary artery disease and in 
immunity towards bacterial and fungal pathogens and combined this knowledge with the non-clinical 
observations. Preclinical evidence from literature did not support an increased risk of CV events in the 
setting of IL-23 blockade with guselkumab. In addition, IL-23 may contribute to immunity for a variety 
of bacterial and fungal pathogens, as assessed in animal models of these infections which has been 
reported in literature.  However, the ability of these models to predict infection risk upon 
pharmacological IL-23 inhibition in humans has not been established. No direct risk follows from the 
non-clinical studies.  
Toxicokinetics 
Cmax  and  AUC  increased  approximately  dose  proportional.  In  the  5-weeks  study  a  modest  and  in  the 
24-weeks study a moderate accumulation of guselkumab was observed. No antibodies to guselkumab 
were observed in any animals during the dosing or recovery intervals; therefore, immune response did 
not affect the TK evaluation. One animal, 10 mg/kg SC Male No. 3003, tested positive for guselkumab 
antibodies  at  the  Day  1  predose  time  point.  It  is  unknown  what  caused  this  positive  result  to  occur 
before the dosing period. This animal was negative for guselkumab ADA when measured at D29. 
The  exposure  margin  for  mean  Cmax  (992.78  µg/mL)  at  the  NOAEL  dose  (50  mg/kg/week)  was 
approximately  206.4-fold  higher  than  the  mean  Cmax  in  psoriasis  patients  (4.81  µg/mL)  following  a 
single 100 mg/kg SC dose of guselkumab (CNTO1959PSO1001 CSR/Tab 10). The exposure margin for 
the  mean  AUCDay  161-168  value  (5411.67  µg.day/mL)  in  monkeys  was  approximately  49.9-fold  higher 
than the mean AUCinf  value in psoriasis patients following a single 100 mg/kg SC dose of guselkumab 
(108.48 µg.day/mL). Both provide substantial safety margins.

Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity  studies  were  not  conducted  with  guselkumab.  Genotoxicity  studies,  routinely  conducted 
for  pharmaceuticals,  are  not  applicable  to  biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals.  Monoclonal 
antibodies  such  as  guselkumab  do  not  have  the  same  distribution  properties  as  small  molecules  and 
are  therefore  not  expected  to  diffuse  across  cellular  or  nuclear  membranes  and  are  not  expected 
interact with DNA or other chromosomal material.  
The absence of genotoxicity studies to address the mutagenic potential of guselkumab was considered 
acceptable by CHMP.  
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  performed  as  guselkumab  has  species  limited  cross  reactivity  that 
precludes  the  conduct  of  traditional  rat  and  mouse  bioassays.  In  the  absence  of  standard 
carcinogenicity  testing  in  rodents,  a  weight-of-evidence  approach  was  utilized  to  determine  the 
potential for carcinogenicity following long-term antagonism of IL-23.

It  was  concluded  that  the  risk  for  malignancy  associated  with  long-term  inhibition  of  IL-23  following 
administration  of  guselkumab  to  humans  is  considered  to  be  low,  but  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  as  a 
potential hazard associated with modulation of IL-23 activity. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  influence  of  guselkumab  administration  on  fertility  was  assessed  in  female  and  male  Guinea  Pigs 
that  were  dosed  50  or  100  mg/kg  guselkumab  subcutaneously  twice  a  week.  In  the  first  GLP  male 
fertility study no guselkumab related effects were observed in male animals. However, it appeared that 
5/25 of the female littermates from the 100 mg/kg dosed males, underwent complete litter loss. This 
was  not  observed  in  a  subsequently  conducted  mechanistic  study  or  in  a  second  GLP  male  fertility 
study,  and  is  therefore  not  considered  treatment-related.  Guselkumab  was  not  detectable  in  the 
female  littermates,  suggesting  that  guselkumab  was  not  transferred  during  mating.  Exposure  levels 
were  24-fold  in  excess  of  the  clinical  exposure  levels.  In  the  female  fertility  study,  no  guselkumab 
related  effect  was  noted  on  female  fertility  up  to  exposure  levels  12  fold  in  excess  of  the  clinical 
exposure levels.

Embryo  foetal  development  (EFD)  and  pre  and  post-natal  development  (PPND)  was  evaluated  in  one 
ePPND  study.  Twenty  pregnant  female  cynomolgous  monkey  were  subcutaneously  dosed  0,  10 or  50 
mg/kg  guselkumab  once  weekly  starting  from  pregnancy  day  20-22  up  to  parturition  (GD  160  ±10). 
Slightly  more  foetal  losses  occurred  in  the  guselkumab  treated  females.    Also  slightly  more  infant 
losses occurred  in  guselkumab  females.  Number of  surviving  infants  was  within  likely outcomes  for  a 
NHP  ePPND  study  (Jarvis  et  al.,  2010)  for  all  groups.  Cmax  and  AUC  increased  approximately  dose 
proportional. Guselkumab was quantifiable in mothers up to 91 days postpartum (last dose).  ADA was

measured in 1/40 mothers and also in her infant. The serum guselkumab ratio for infant/mother was 
0.7  for  10  mg/kg  dosed  females  and  0.83  for  50  mg/kg  dosed  females.  Again,  dosing  was  quite  in 
excess to the requirements of S6R1, which recalls that an animal exposure 10 fold in excess of human 
exposure levels is already sufficient. 
Toxicokinetics  
During Gestation 
The Cmax and the AUC within 1 dose interval increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner 
in the dose range from 10 to 50 mg/kg following weekly SC administrations of guselkumab to pregnant 
monkeys.  Steady  state  was  reached  by  GD91  following  weekly  SC  administrations  of  guselkumab  to 
pregnant  monkeys.  Moderate  drug  accumulation  occurred  in  the  pregnant  monkeys’  systemic 
circulation when guselkumab was administered SC once every week. Quantifiable concentrations were 
observed up to 91 days post parturition for most maternal and infant animals. 
In the Postnatal Period 
The  mean  T1/2  of  guselkumab  was  relatively  consistent  between  the  10  and  50  mg/kg/week  dose 
groups in maternal and infant animals. The mean T1/2 of guselkumab in the infants was slightly longer 
than the one in the maternal animals. Guselkumab concentrations were below the lowest quantifiable 
concentration in the milk samples on postpartum day (PND) 28, which is expected since IgG are only 
very  limited  excreted  in  the  first  milk.  Significant  guselkumab  concentrations  were  observed  in  the 
serum samples at the same time point. Guselkumab concentrations in the infants were similar to the 
ones in the maternal animals on PPD28. 
Anti-Drug Antibodies 
One out of 40 maternal animals and its infant from the guselkumab treated groups tested ADA positive 
(Adult  Female  No.  2512  and  Infant  No.  2121,  10  mg/kg/week).  The  mother  exhibited  an  accelerated 
decrease  in  guselkumab  concentrations  starting  from  the  time  point  on  GD56.  Serum  guselkumab 
concentrations  in  all  collected  samples  from  the  infant  were  below  the  lowest  quantifiable 
concentration.  Two  control  infants  (Infant  Nos.  1161  and  1186)  tested  ADA  positive  for  unknown 
reasons;  both  maternal  females  (Adult  Female  Nos.  1516  and  1518,  respectively)  were  negative  for 
ADA.

Local Tolerance  
Separate studies assessing the local tolerability of guselkumab have not been conducted. Reactions at 
the injection site were evaluated in guinea pigs administered twice weekly SC doses of up to 100 
mg/kg guselkumab, and in single dose, repeat dose, and ePPND studies in which cynomolgus monkeys 
received weekly IV and SC doses of up to 50 mg/kg guselkumab. All findings were considered to be 
related to the dosing procedure and not to treatment with guselkumab. 
Local tolerance has been addressed in the repeated dose toxicity and the reprotoxicity studies. No 
guselkumab related effects were found. The absence of dedicated local tolerance studies is considered 
acceptable by CHMP. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity has been sufficiently addressed in the repeated dose toxicology and the ePPND study 
in monkeys. Cellular distribution of T and B cells was examined on H&E stained lymphoid tissues 
(spleen, thymus, lymph nodes (axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric) Peyer’s patch and 
tonsil) were stained using specific antibodies towards T and B cells. Hematology, immunophenotyping 
via flow cytometry, and TDAR to KLH were also assessed. In the ePPND study hematology, 
immunophenotyping, and TDAR to KLH were assessed in females and their infants. Lymphoid tissues 
from infants were examined microscopically and IHC was performed for CD3/CD20 cell subsets. 
Guselkumab treatment had no effect on hematology, immunophenotyping, TDAR to KLH, 
histopathology of immune tissues, or T- and B-cell distribution in monkeys or their offspring. 
Tissue cross reactivity of guselkumab was tested on a series of 35 human tissues from 3 subjects and 
32 cynomolgous monkey tissues in a non-GLP and a  GLP TCR study. Besides the expected 
guselkumab staining of macrophages, dendritic cells, keratinocytes and low grade neural staining, 
unusual cardiomyocyte staining was observed. This preceded the conduct of the CV safety 
pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys, in which besides CV endpoints, tissues were collected 
from some animals and evaluated by IHC at the same laboratory that conducted the non-GLP and GLP 
Assessment report

TCR studies. These indicated that the cytoplasmic binding observed during in TCR studies is likely not 
relevant to in vivo studies. Absence of adverse CV effects and lack of heart and muscle pathology in 
guselkumab treated cynomolgus monkey in CV safety pharmacology study and in the GLP 5 week/24-
week study, further supported the lack of guselkumab related CV effects in monkeys. 
Serum Compatibility and Haemolytic Potential of Guselkumab was assessed in an in vitro assays using 
human  serum  and  human  whole  blood  from  a  human  volunteer.  No  precipitation  or  coagulation  was 
observed  when  guselkumab  was  co  incubated  with  human  serum,  and  no  signs  of  haemolysis  were 
observed  following  the  co  incubation  of  guselkumab  with  human  whole  blood.  In  short,  results 
indicated  that  guselkumab  was  compatible  in  serum  and  exhibited  no  haemolytic  potential  at 
concentrations up to 65 mg/mL 
Further studies addressing toxicity of guselkumab in juvenile animals, in addition to the ePPND study, 
were not conducted, which was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk 
Assessment for guselkumab is required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Guselkumab is a newly developed human anti-IL23p19 antibody that targets psoriasis, an autoimmune 
dermatological  disease.  From  the  assumed  mechanism  of  action  guselkumab  might  be  efficient  in 
reducing  the  symptoms  of  psoriasis.  A  thorough  preclinical  study  program  has  been  conducted. 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  characterized  guselkumab  in  terms  of  its  binding  interactions, 
mechanism  of  action,  functional  effects  of  neutralization,  species  cross-reactivity,  and  in  vivo  activity 
supporting a psoriasis indication. 
The  non-clinical  studies  adequately  provide  evidence  that  guselkumab  neutralizes  human  IL-23  with 
high affinity and specificity and consequently inhibits the immune response by Th17 lymphocytes.  
Human  IL-23  seemed  to  increase  serum  levels  of  several  cytokines  in  mice.  Intraperitoneal  (i.p.) 
administration of both recombinant mouse (rm) IL-23 and rhIL-23 to C57BL/6 mice was found to result 
in  dose  dependent  increases  in  serum  levels  of  IL-  1α,  G-CSF,  IP-10,  TNFα,  GM-CSF  and  MCP-1. 
Guselkumab  administration  was  shown  to  attenuate  rhIL-23  induced  increases  in  serum  levels  of 
cytokines IL- 1α and G-CSF without any significant change in TNFα, IP-10 or GM-CSF levels. The low 
number of study animals and the high deviations of the data prevent to draw a firm conclusion. It was 
stated that it was not possible to measure IL-17A production (IL-17F was not measured at all) induced 
by  hIL-23,  which  impairs  the  interpretation  of  the  data.  Overall,  this  animal  model  of  testing  the 
effectiveness of hIL-23 and consequently the inhibitory capability of guselkumab is of limited value. It 
is accepted that no nonclinical model of plaque psoriasis that recapitulates all facets of human psoriasis 
is  available.  From  an  efficacy  point  of  view  human  studies  may  provide  more  robust  evidence  of  the 
therapeutic value of guselkumab. 
In  vivo  secondary  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacodynamic  interactions  studies  have  not  been 
conducted.  This  approach is  acceptable  as guselkumab  is  highly  specific  and  no  other  binding targets 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 31/148 
 
 
 
 
 
are expected. Similarly, no other specific IL-23 antagonists, - except ustekinumab, that is an IL-12 and 
IL-23  antagonist  –  is  known,  therefore  it  is  unlikely  to  have  pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  co-
administered drugs. 
Secondary  pharmacological  in  vitro  studies  investigated  the  tissue  cross-reactivity  of  guselkumab. 
Guselkumab  was  not  found  to  bind  to  pig  cardiac  myosin,  pig  muscle  myosin  or  recombinant  human 
myosin  in  a  further  in-vitro  binding  study.  The  similar  patterns  of  cross-reactivity  exhibited  by 
guselkumab  between  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues  provides  further  evidence  of  the 
pharmacological relevance of this species. It would seem that the cytoplasmic staining of myocytes is 
not  relevant  to  in-vivo  administration  as  the  antibodies  are  too  big  to  cross  cellular  membrane.  The 
lack  of  myocyte  staining  associated  with  unconjugated  guselkumab  administration  reported in  the  CV 
safety pharmacology study further corroborates this. 
In  safety  and  toxicological  studies  no  significant  treatment  related  adverse  effects  on  cardiovascular, 
respiratory and CNS functions were revealed. 
As IL23 is a soluble target, it is expected that pharmacokinetics will follow the normal FcRN mediated 
degradation  pathway  of  IgG’s,  also  apparent  from  a  dose  proportional  increase  in  C max  and  AUC. 
Animals were dosed either once (cynomolgous monkey) or twice (guinea pig) a week in contrast to the 
clinical  posology  (first  two  doses  4  weeks  apart  followed  by  8  week  intervals).  A  result  of  the  more 
frequent dosing interval in animals, up to 2.8 fold accumulation was observed in cynomolgous monkey. 
No toxicity was observed in cynomolgous monkey that were exposed to guselkumab 50-fold in excess 
of clinical levels, except for a transient, statistically significant reduction in IgM titers observed in the 
high  dose  group.  No  corresponding  effects  on  IgG  levels  were  observed,  and  no  guselkumab  related 
infections were identified in any of the toxicity studies conducted. Also the margin of safety (8 fold in 
terms of AUC, 34 fold in terms of Cmax) between exposure levels at the lower dose level (10 mg s.c. 
qw) tested in the repeat dose cynomolgus toxicity study (at which animals did not exhibit any signs of 
immunosuppression)  and  reported  human  exposures  following  a  single  100  mg  s.c.  dose  to  psoriatic 
patients is reasonable. Therefore it can be anticipated that guselkumab will not functionally affect host 
immunity. 
The applicant has conducted a literature search to the role of IL 23 in Coronary artery disease and in 
immunity towards bacterial and fungal pathogens and combined this knowledge with the non-clinical 
observations. Preclinical evidence from literature did not support an increased risk of CV events in the 
setting of IL-23 blockade with guselkumab. In addition, IL-23 may contribute to immunity for a variety 
of bacterial and fungal pathogens, as assessed in animal models of these infections which has been 
reported in literature.  However, the ability of these models to predict infection risk upon 
pharmacological IL-23 inhibition in humans has not been established. No direct risk follows from the 
non-clinical studies.  
No carcinogenicity studies were performed and as such, a weight of evidence approached was used. It 
was  concluded  that  the  risk  of  malignancy  associated  with  long-term  inhibition  of  IL-23  following 
administration of guselkumab to humans is considered to be low, but it cannot be completely ruled out 
as a potential hazard associated with modulation of IL-23 activity. Malignancies has been included has 
an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Also  malignancies  in  humans  will  be monitored  during  clinical 
trials and in post-marketing.   
In  the  ePPND  study  in  monkeys,  an  increase  in  fetal  and  infant  deaths  were  observed  in  the  treated 
groups.  (3/19  fetal  deaths  were  found  in  control  group  versus  12/40  in  treated  monkeys.    4/19  fetal 
and  infant  deaths  were  found  in  control  group  versus  18/40  in  the  treated  monkeys.  Convincing 
arguments that all embryo/foetal and neonatal deaths were within the range of historical control data 
Assessment report

were provided. The information with regard to the causes of death does not point towards a relation to 
guselkumab treatment. Furthermore, data from literature indicate that IL-23 deficient mice (IL-23p19-
/-)  are  normal  in  size  and  fully  fertile.  Instead,  transgenic  mice  with  widespread  expression  of  p19 
showed  systemic  inflammation,  infertility,  impaired  growth,  and  premature  death.  In  humans, 
knowledge  on  the  role  of IL-23  in  pregnancy  and  potential  role in  spontaneous  recurrent  abortions  is 
emerging and rather indicative for an improvement of pregnancy maintenance upon inhibition of IL-23. 
Also from literature, a relation to IL-23 inhibition and increase of number of abortions is thus not likely. 
A conclusion on placental transfer of guselkumab in guinea pig could not be drawn based on the data 
obtained in the female fertility study, since determination of maternal / foetal serum guselkumab ratio 
was done at GD30 when placental transfer is not yet expected in the guinea pig (reviewed by Pentsuk 
and Van der Laan, 2009).  In the ePPND study, guselkumab distribution to infants have been mainly a 
result  of  FcRN  mediated  placental  transfer  as  IgGs,  like  guselkumab,  are  only  poorly  excreted  in  the 
first milk of cynomolgous monkeys (reviewed by Pentsuk and Van der Laan, 2009 & Fujimoto K, 1983). 
Plasma exposure to guselkumab was similar in the pups and the dam.  
The development of the immune system occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy and training of the 
immune  system  after  birth.  The  transplacental  exposure  to  guselkumab  of  infant  monkeys  occurs  in 
the  third  trimester  of  pregnancy  and  will  not  likely  disturb  development.  Thereby,  analyses  of  the 
immune  system  by  histopathology  and  also  by  functional  testing  in  these  monkeys  do  not  indicate 
impaired  function  of  the  immune  system.  It  seems  that  the  immune  system  is  functional  in  in-utero 
exposed monkey infants and it can be anticipated that a functional response to immunisation will not 
be disturbed either. However, the applicant notes that guidance with regard to vaccinations to in-utero 
guselkumab exposure should be nationally regulated. This is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Local  tolerance  of  the  proposed  clinical  formulation  was  adequately  addressed  as  part  of  the  ePPND 
study (T-2012-019), which is acceptable and in line with the ICH S6 (R1) guideline.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
The  IL-23  neutralizing  capability,  specificity  and  the  inhibition  of  the  downstream  production  of  IL-17 
by guselkumab have been satisfactorily demonstrated through non-clinical pharmacodynamics studies. 
The primary pharmacodynamic studies are sufficient and the lack of secondary and pharmacodynamics 
interaction studies is acceptable due to the high specificity of guselkumab.  
In  ePPND  study  in  cynomolgous  monkeys  although  numerically  higher,  fetal  losses  fall  within  the 
variable  historical  control  data.  Applicant  discussed  literature  data  on  IL-23  during  pregnancy, 
suggesting positive correlation between spontaneous abortions and IL-23 levels and limited human in 
vitro data are suggesting similar correlations. 
In utero exposure and functional consequences of that are included in the RMP as missing information. 
Histopathological and functional analyses in transplacentally exposed monkeys do not indicate impaired 
function  of  the  immune  system  and  it  can  be  anticipated  that  a  functional  response  to  childhood 
vaccinations will not be disturbed either.  
Guselkumab could not be detected in breast milk from cynomolgus monkeys as measured at post-natal 
day 28.  However,  as  it  is  unknown  whether  guselkumab  is  excreted  in  human  milk  precautionary 
statements about breast feeding have been added to the SmPC.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  efficacy  of  guselkumab  in  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  is 
supported by analyses from 6 core psoriasis studies:  
• 
Two Phase 1 studies:  
CNTO1959PSO1001 (referred to as PSO1001)  
CNTO1959PSO1002 (referred to as PSO1002)  
•  One Phase 2 study:  
CNTO1959PSO2001 (X-PLORE, PSO2001)  
• 
Three Phase 3 studies:  
CNTO1959PSO3001 (VOYAGE 1, PSO3001) 
CNTO1959PSO3002 (VOYAGE 2, PSO3002) 
CNTO1959PSO3003 (NAVIGATE, PSO3003) 
The  safety  of  guselkumab  was  evaluated  primarily  in  the  psoriasis  population  in  a  total  of  1,748 
subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  treated  in  studies  PSO2001,  PSO3001,  PSO3002, 
and PSO3003. In the analysis of the Phase 3 safety data from studies PSO3001 and PSO3002, 1,367 
subjects included in the primary analysis data set received the proposed guselkumab dose regimen of 
100 mg, administered SC, at Weeks 0 and 4 and then q8w thereafter, including 592 subjects treated 
for  48  weeks  (1  year).  The  size  of  this  safety  database  is  sufficient  to  provide  a  robust  evaluation  of 
the safety of guselkumab in the target population. 
In  addition  to  the  6  core  psoriasis  studies,  4  completed  (CNTO1959NAP1001,  CNT01959NAP1002, 
CNTO1275ARA2001, 
CNTO1959PPP2001) 
and

CNTO1959PSA2001,  CNTO1959PPP3001,  CNTO1959PSO3004,  CNTO1959PSO3005)  with  guselkumab 
in  other  indications  (PPP,  PsA),  other  populations  (eg,  from  Japan  only),  or  to  investigate  drug-drug 
interactions  (study  CNTO1959PSO1003),  provide  supportive  safety  and/or  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The core psoriasis clinical development program of guselkumab consisted of two Phase 1, one Phase 2, 
and three Phase 3 studies. The single dose studies were carried out in healthy volunteers and psoriasis 
patients, while the multiple dose studies were carried out in psoriasis patients.  
A  lyophilized  formulation  was  used  for  early  Phase  1  and  2  studies  (PSO1001,  PSO1002,  PSO2001, 
ARA2001, and PPP2001), and a liquid formulation in a prefilled syringe (PFS-U) was used later on. The 
product to be marketed is the liquid formulation (PFS-U) and this was used in all Phase 3 studies.  
Analytical methods 
Guselkumab concentrations 
Two methods were developed for the determination of serum guselkumab concentrations. A validated 
dissociation-enhanced  lanthanide  fluorescent  immunoassay  (DELFIA)  method  was  used  to  determine

serum  guselkumab  concentrations  for  samples  in  early  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  studies,  including 
PSO1001,  PSO1002,  and  PSO2001.  An  electrochemiluminescent  immunoassay  (ECLIA)  method  was 
later developed and validated for the measurement of serum guselkumab concentrations in the Phase 
3  studies  including  PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and  PSO3003.  Serum  samples  from  the  Phase  2  PSO2001 
study  were  initially  analysed  using  the  DELFIA  method  but  were  subsequently  reanalysed  using  the 
ECLIA method. Both assays displayed acceptable precision, accuracy, dilution linearity, sample stability 
and the assays have been cross-validated. The sensitivity of the DEFLIA method was 40 ng/ml and the 
ECLIA method had a slightly better sensitivity of 10 ng/ml.  
Determination of Antibodies to Guselkumab 
The bioanalytical method for ADA determination is a non-quantitative, titer-based bridging ECL-based 
immunoassay. The presence of ADA was evaluated using the recommended three tiered approach: an 
initial  screening  assay  to  identify  potentially  ADA  positive  samples,  a  confirmation  (specificity)  assay 
based on competition with exogenously added guselkumab, and a determination of the titer of ADA for 
confirmed positive samples.   
Assay for the determination of neutralising antibodies to guselkumab 
A neutralising antibody (Nab) was developed based on a reduction in signal when NAb compete with 
Ruthenium labelled IL-23 for binding to guselkumab. The cut point of the assay was estimated using 
serum samples form psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis patients. The assay displayed acceptable 
precision, robustness and sample stability. The sensitivity of the assay was shown to 157.5 ng/mL in 
neat human serum and the assay could tolerate a maximum of 0.83 µg/mL of guselkumab. 
Absorption  
Guselkumab  was  slowly  absorbed  into  the  systemic  circulation  with  median  time  to  reach  the 
maximum  serum  concentration  (Tmax)  values  of  approximately  3.2  to  6.0  days  after  single 
subcutaneous (SC) administration at doses ranging from 10 mg to 300 mg in subjects with psoriasis, 
and 5.0 to 5.5 days after a single 100-mg SC administration in healthy subjects.   
The mean absolute bioavailability (F) of guselkumab following a single 100-mg SC administration was 
estimated to be approximately 47.6% and 48.7% for lyophilized formulation and the liquid formulation 
in PFS-U. By comparison to other mABs the absolute bioavailability of the product to be marketed is at 
the lower end of the spectrum. 
Bioequivalence 
A phase 1 PK comparability study in healthy subjects (NAP1001) demonstrated satisfactory PK 
comparability of guselkumab between the lyophilized formulation and the liquid formulation. The 
systemic exposures (Cmax and AUCs) of guselkumab were comparable between the liquid formulation 
(supplied as PFS-U) and the lyophilized formulation: the geometric mean ratios of the Cmax and AUCs 
were close to 1 (0.96-0.99) and the 90% Cis of the geometric mean ratios were all within the interval 
of 0.80-1.25. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution based on the terminal phase (Vz) values observed following a single 
IV administration in healthy subjects was approximately 6.7 to 10.1 L (98 to 123 mL/kg), suggesting 
that guselkumab is primarily confined in the circulatory system with limited extravascular tissue 
Assessment report

distribution. Following a single SC administration, the mean Vz/F values were approximately 16.1 to 
28.0 L (177 to 288 mL/kg) in subjects with psoriasis (PSO1001 Part 2 and PSO1002) and 12.9 to 16.6 
L (191 to 241 mL/kg) in healthy subjects (NAP1001). 
Elimination 
The mean T1/2 values ranged from approximately 12.3 to 19.1 days after a single IV administration in 
healthy  subjects  (NAP1001,  PSO1001  Part  1)  and  approximately  14.7  to  17.6  days  after  a  single  SC 
administration  in  subjects  with  psoriasis  (PSO1001  Part  2  and  PSO1002).  The  mean  T1/2  value  was 
approximately  17  days  (ranged  from  approximately  16.6  to  17.2  days)  after  a  single  100-mg  SC 
administration in healthy subjects (NAP1001). 
The mean CL values following a single IV administration in healthy subjects were approximately 0.299 
to 0.479 L/day (3.6 to 6.0 mL/day/kg, PSO1001 Part 1) and 0.288 L/day (4.2 mL/day/kg, NAP1001). 
The mean apparent total systemic clearance (CL/F) values following a single SC administration ranged 
from approximately 0.677 to 1.278 L/day (7.5 to 13.9 mL/day/kg) in subjects with psoriasis (PSO1001 
Part 2 and PSO1002) and 0.531 to 0.681 L/day (7.8 to 9.9 mL/day/kg) in healthy subjects (NAP1001). 
Given an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%, these CL/F values are generally consistent 
with the CL values reported in the IV studies (PSO1001 Part 1 and NAP1001). The CL/F values were 
somewhat higher in subjects with psoriasis (N=3 to 5 subjects per group).  
These findings of higher CL/F values in subjects with psoriasis may be attributed to a variety of factors 
including small sample size in Phase 1 studies in subjects with psoriasis, inter-study and/or inter-
subject variability, or differences in weight between the study populations. Because the kinetics was 
linear and time independent it might be assumed that guselkumab is eliminated via a large-capacity 
nonspecific IgG elimination pathway and the specific target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) pathway 
does not have a role.   
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  systemic  exposure  (maximum  observed  concentration  [Cmax]  and  area  under  the  concentration 
versus  time  curve  [AUC])  increased  in  an  approximately  dose-proportional  manner    after  single 
intravenous (IV) administration  at doses ranging from 0.03 to 10 mg/kg (ie, approximately 2.7 mg to 
900 mg for a subject weighing 90 kg) or after a single SC administration at doses ranging from 10 mg 
to 300 mg. 
Guselkumab exhibited linear PK following multiple SC administrations at dose levels ranging from 15 to 
200 mg (Study PSO2001). Serum guselkumab concentrations achieved steady state approximately by 
Week  16  for  all  dose  groups  randomized  to  guselkumab.  In  each  treatment  group,  mean  or  median 
trough  serum  guselkumab  concentrations  were  maintained  at  steady  state  through  Week  52.  There 
was no evidence of substantial accumulation in serum guselkumab concentrations over time.  
It is noted that dose proportionality is not apparent when comparing mean or median serum 
concentrations from Week 4 through Week 52 between the 5 mg q12w group and the 50 mg or 200 
mg q12w groups. A possible and reasonable explanation of this finding is that the 5 mg q12w group 
30.6% of subjects at Week 16 had concentrations below BLQ.

Special populations 
No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in special populations (i.e., paediatric [<18 years of 
age], elderly, subjects with renal or hepatic impairment). Results from population PK analyses indicate 
that  age  (>65  years  versus  <65  years),  or  baseline  laboratory  measurements  (alkaline  phosphatase 
and  estimated  serum  creatinine  clearance)  did  not  have  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  CL/F  of 
guselkumab.   
The lack of PK studies in special patient groups was found acceptable on the ground that guselkumab 
pharmacokinetics  shows  the  general  features  of  other  IgG  based  mABs  and  previous  regulatory  and 
therapeutic experiences with these drugs do not warrant these studies. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The  serum  guselkumab  concentration  data  collected  from  the  Phase  2  dose-ranging  study  (PSO2001 
through Week 40) and 2 Phase 3 studies (PSO3001 through Week 44 and PSO3002 through Week 48) 
were  utilized to  perform  a  population  PK  analysis  using  nonlinear  mixed-effect  modelling  approach.  A 
total  of  13,014  serum  samples  were  included  in  the  population  PK  analysis.  A  one-compartment  PK 
model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination was selected as the structural PK model to 
describe  the  serum  concentration  versus  time  profiles  of  guselkumab  following  SC  injections  in 
subjects with psoriasis. 
Standard  diagnostic  plots  were  generated  to  evaluate  the  adequacy  of  the  base  and  final  covariate 
models.  Among  the  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors  evaluated,  comorbidity  of  diabetes,  and  race  (non-
Caucasian  versus  Caucasian)  had  marginal  effects  on  CL/F  (12%  and  11%,  respectively)  while  the 
influence  of  body  weight  on  CL/F  and  Vd/F  were  are  greater  than  20%.  Note  that  Cl/F  and  Vd/F  are 
positively  correlated  with  each-other  and  they  are  negatively  correlated  with  AUCt  and  Ctroughss. 
Thus,  the  effects  of  body  weight  on  concentration  via  these  two  PK  parameters  are  additive  but  still 
moderate. The model-predicted median steady-state trough concentration and AUCt of guselkumab in 
patients  subjects with a body weight > 90 kg  were about 34% and 29% lower than in subjects < 90 
kg, respectively, at 100 mg q8w. 
Population PK/PD modelling 
For exposure-response modelling analyses for efficacy, two complementary modelling approaches were 
used to characterize the exposure-response relationships in subjects with psoriasis:  
1)  
a  landmark  analysis  approach  using  ordinal  logistic  regression  to  link  the  IGA  and  PASI 
outcomes at Week 16 and Week 28 to the exposure parameters of model-predicted individual trough 
serum guselkumab concentration and AUC; and  
2) 
a  longitudinal  modelling  approach  employing  a  mechanism  based  indirect  response  (IDR) 
model to characterize the time-course of the IGA and PASI outcomes.   
Both  models  adequately  described  the  concentration  and  time  dependence  of  the  therapeutic 
outcomes.    The  parameter  estimates  applied  imply  that  heavier  subjects  expect  slower  improvement 
and  less  sensitivity  to  treatment.  To  justify  the  dose  selection,  simulations  were  conducted  for  the 
proportions of subjects achieving IGA 0/1, IGA 0, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rates for 
the  dose  levels  up  to  200  mg  under  the  same  q8w  dose  regimen  as  in  the  PSO3001  and  PSO3002 
studies.  The  simulations  suggest  that  the  100-mg  q8w  dose  regimen  resulted  in  systemic  exposures 
that  provide  high  efficacy  approaching  the  plateau  of  the  dose-response  curve  for  the  overall 
population. 
Effect of Antibodies to Guselkumab on Pharmacokinetics 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 38/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Seventy-nine of 1,454 (5.4%) subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab were included 
in  the  population  PK  analysis.  In  the  population  PK  covariate  analysis,  the  presence  of  antibodies  to 
guselkumab did not have an apparent impact on PK exposure of guselkumab when comparing the CL/F 
values  between  subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  and  subjects  who  were 
negative  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab    In  a  separate  sensitivity  analysis  using  the  final  model,  the 
impact of antibodies to guselkumab as a time-varying variable did not have an apparent effect on CL/F 
of  guselkumab.  However,  due  to the  low  incidence of  antibodies to  guselkumab,  the  result  should  be 
interpreted with caution. 
Mean and median serum guselkumab concentrations in subjects positive for antibodies to guselkumab 
were generally similar compared with those who were negative for antibodies to guselkumab in studies 
PSO2001, PSO3001, PSO3002, and PSO3003. In addition, no apparent impact of the peak titer levels 
of antibodies to guselkumab on the PK of guselkumab was observed in subjects positive for antibodies 
to guselkumab. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
An  in  vitro  study  showed  that  IL-23  did  not  alter  the  expression  or  activity  of  multiple  cytochrome 
(CYP)  P450  enzymes  (CYP1A2,  2B6,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  and  3A4),  which  suggested  that  therapeutic 
protein-drug  interactions  between  guselkumab  and  CYP  substrates  are  unlikely.  A  Phase  1  clinical 
study (PSO1003) was conducted in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis to evaluate if blocking 
IL-23  with  guselkumab  for  treatment  of  psoriasis  will  alter  the  metabolism  of  probe  substrates 
metabolized by CYP450 isozymes. 
Study CNTO1959PSO1003 was an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 drug interaction study designed to 
evaluate the effect of a single SC dose of 200 mg guselkumab on the PK of a cocktail of representative 
probe  substrates  of  CYP  isozymes  (midazolam  [CYP3A4],  warfarin  [CYP2C9],  omeprazole  [CYP2C19], 
dextromethorphan [CYP2D6], and caffeine [CYP1A2]).  
A total of 17 subjects with psoriasis were enrolled into the study, of which 16 subjects received at least 
1  probe  cocktail  administration  and  14  subjects  received  treatment  with  guselkumab.  Of  the  16 
subjects who received study agents (either probe cocktail or guselkumab), 12 subjects completed the 
study.  
All  subjects  were  to  receive  a  single  SC  dose  of  200  mg  guselkumab  on  Day  8.  All  subjects  were  to 
receive  a  probe  cocktail  administration  on  Days  1,  15,  and  36.  The  probe  cocktail  consisted  of  oral 
doses of 0.03 mg/kg of midazolam, 10 mg of warfarin (+10 mg of vitamin K), 20 mg of omeprazole, 
30 mg of dextromethorphan, and 100 mg of caffeine. 
Blood  samples  were  collected  for  the  measurement  of  plasma  concentration  of  CYP  probe  substrates 
including  midazolam,  omeprazole,  S-warfarin,  dextromethorphan  and  caffeine.  PK  parameters  for 
midazolam,  omeprazole,  S-warfarin,  dextromethorphan  and  caffeine  were  calculated  from  plasma 
concentration-time data using non-compartmental analyses. 
PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental 
analyses. PK parameters included, but were not limited to, maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and the area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity with 
extrapolation of the terminal phase (AUCinf). The interaction effect was assessed by computing the 
geometric mean ratios and associated confidence intervals of the PK parameters measured at Day15 
and Day 36 versus Day 1. In none of the cases was the point estimate above 2 which would indicate a 
clinically significant interaction. The upper confidence limits were above 2 in the case of

dextromethorphan, but this is due to the large inter-subject variability. Results of study PSO1003 
suggest that the metabolic activities of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 were not 
affected by the decreased inflammation associated with the improvement of disease activity in subjects 
with psoriasis. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and safety 
The proportions of subjects who had AEs, SAEs, infections, infections requiring treatment, and AEs 
leading to discontinuation through Week 28 were evaluated with respect to observed steady-state 
trough serum guselkumab concentration levels at Week 28.  In general, the occurrence of selected 
safety events was not associated with serum guselkumab concentrations. This was evidenced by the 
proportions of subjects who had treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, infections, infections requiring 
antimicrobial treatment, or AEs leading to discontinuation that were not increased consistently with 
increasing steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations . Although subjects who had serum 
guselkumab concentrations at the fourth quartile level had 12-13% higher rates of infections when 
compared with subjects who had serum guselkumab concentrations in the lower  three quartiles, the 
clinical relevance of this finding appears to be limited, given that the vast majority of infections was 
non-serious and mild to moderate in intensity and that the frequency of the infections requiring 
treatment was generally similar across all four exposure quartiles. The number of subjects who 
discontinued the treatment due to adverse events is minimal and does not show exposure dependency. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Guselkumab  is  a  fully  human  immunoglobulin  G1  lambda  (IgG1λ)  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that 
binds to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL 23) with high specificity and affinity. By 
binding  to  the  p19  subunit  of  IL-23,  guselkumab  blocks  the  binding  of  extracellular  IL-23  to  the  cell 
surface  IL-23  receptor,  inhibiting  IL  23  mediated  intracellular  signaling,  activation  and  cytokine 
production. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Biomarkers  were  assessed  in  three  clinical  studies  including  one  Phase  1  (CNTO1959PSO1001),  one 
Phase 2 (CNTO1959PSO2001) and one Phase 3 (CNTO1959PSO3001) study. 
In  PSO1001,  histologic  analysis  and  gene  expression  profiles  of  skin  biopsy  specimens  obtained  from 
guselkumab-treated subjects were compared with those obtained from placebo treated subjects. Skin 
biopsy specimens were collected before initiation of treatment (baseline) and at Weeks 1 and 12. 
Treatment with guselkumab resulted in improvement in histological measures of psoriasis at Week 12 
including reductions in epidermal thickness, T-cell density, and dendritic cells. At baseline, increases in 
T-cell counts (CD3), myeloid dendritic cell (DC) counts (CD11c), and epidermal hyperplasia and KRT16 
were  observed  in  lesional  skin  compared  with  values  in  nonlesional  skin.  At  Week  1,  modest 
improvement  was  observed  from  baseline  in  epidermal  thickness  and  in  numbers  of  CD3  and  CD11c 
immune  cells.  At  Week  12,  statistically  significant  reductions  in  epidermal  thickness  and  T-cell  and 
inflammatory  CD11c  DC  counts  were  observed  for  each  guselkumab  dose  group  compared  with 
baseline  (p<0.05  each).  Langerhans  cells,  which  are  displaced  in  active  psoriatic  lesions,  resumed  a

normal panepidermal pattern in guselkumab-treated biopsy specimens at Week 12. No reduction was 
observed  in  epidermal  thickness  or  T-cell  density  in  placebo-treated  subjects;  however,  a  reduction 
from baseline in DC counts was observed for placebo at Week 12.  
Affymetrix  microarrays  were  used  to  define  the  transcriptome  of  lesional  and  nonlesional  skin  at 
baseline  and  weeks  1  and  12  after  guselkumab  treatment  to  assess  the  overall  effect  of  guselkumab 
on  the  molecular  disease  profile.  The  disease  profile  was  defined  as  1224  transcripts  (891  unique 
ENTREZ-annotated  genes)  with  significant  modulations  in  gene  expression  when  comparing  lesional 
with  nonlesional  biopsy  specimens  at  baseline.  These  genes  are  highly  characteristic  of  the  psoriasis 
disease  profile  as  previously  reported.  Of  the  1224  disease-profile  genes  described,  1170  were 
normalized by 70% or greater in week-12 biopsy specimens of psoriatic lesions treated with high-dose 
(100 mg and 300 mg combined analyses) guselkumab.  
Gene  transcripts  associated  with  epidermal  hyperplasia,  including  keratin  6A  (KRT6A)  and  Keratin  16 
(KRT16) and STAT3, were decreased with guselkumab treatment to levels less than those observed in 
nonlesional  skin,  indicating  a  strong  reduction  in  regenerative  epidermal  growth.  Expressions  of  gene 
transcripts associated with the IL-23/Th17 pathway were also determined. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), CXCL1, 
S100A7A  (S100A15),  S100A7  (psoriasin),  S100A8, and  S100A9,  which  are  strongly  induced  by  IL-17 
in psoriatic lesions, were significantly decreased after guselkumab treatment. There was no impact on 
interferon  gamma  (IFNγ).  These  data  suggest  that IL-23  regulates  expression  of  Th17  pathway  gene 
targets  in  psoriasis  lesions,  with  limited  effect  on  Th1  pathway  gene  targets.  Overall,  the  results 
demonstrated  transcriptional  changes  consistent  with  the  proposed  mechanism  of  action  of 
guselkumab and improvement in the psoriasis molecular disease profile. 
Serum  IL-17A  levels  were  analyzed  in  PSO1001  at  baseline  and  at  Week  1  and  Week  12  compared 
with  placebo-treated  subjects.  Significant  reductions  from  baseline  in  circulating  IL  17A  levels  were 
observed at Week 1 (p˂0.05) and Week 12 (p˂0.01) in guselkumab responders, and no changes were 
observed  in  the  placebo  group.  These  data  show  that  blockade  of  IL-23  with  guselkumab  reduces 
production of the effector cytokine IL-17A. Ten other serum proteins were analyzed for changes after 
treatment with guselkumab, including inflammatory proteins: IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12p40, IL-
12p70, IL-8, CRP, IL-23p19, and CCL22 (MDC). CCL22/MDC was the only analyte reduced at Week 12 
after guselkumab treatment compared with placebo, which is aligned with the mechanism of action of 
guselkumab and the selective blockade of IL-23. 
CNTO1959PSO2001  was  a  Phase  2,  randomized,  placebo-  and  active-comparator  controlled,  parallel 
group,  multicenter,  dose-ranging  study  of  guselkumab  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque 
psoriasis.  The  target  population  was  men  and  women  18  years  of  age  and  older,  with  a  diagnosis  of 
plaque-type  psoriasis  with  or  without  PsA  for  at  least  6  months  prior  to  first  administration  of  study 
agent. Approximately 280 subjects were randomized equally to 1 of 7 groups (n = 40 per group). The 
placebo  group  received  SC  administration  at  Weeks  0,  4,  and  8,  followed  by guselkumab  100  mg  SC 
administration  at  Week  16  and  q8w  thereafter  through  Week  40.  Guselkumab  treatment  groups 
received  SC  administration  of  5  mg,  50  mg  and  200  mg  at  Weeks  0,  4,  16  followed  by  q12w  dosing 
thereafter through Week 40, or SC administration of 15 mg and 100 mg at Weeks 0, 4, 16 followed by 
q8w  dosing  thereafter  through  Week  40.  The  adalimumab  treatment  group  received  80  mg  SC 
administration  at  Week  0  followed  by  40  mg  SC  administration  at  Week  1  and  every  other  week 
thereafter through Week 39. 
Serum  levels  of  IL-17A,  IL-17F,  and  IL-22,  which  are  associated  with  the  IL-23/Th17  pathway,  were 
measured in Study PSO2001 as PD markers, in addition to a broad panel of 32 exploratory markers. As 
expected, based on the mechanism of action, significant reductions from baseline in serum IL 17A, IL 
17F, and IL-22 levels were observed in guselkumab-treated subjects while no changes were observed

in  the  placebo  group  prior  to  cross  over  to  guselkumab  treatment.  Guselkumab  (100  mg)  and 
adalimumab significantly reduced IL 17A and IL-17F serum levels compared to baseline and placebo at 
Week  4  and  Week  16.  Guselkumab  achieved  a  significantly  greater  reduction  of  IL  17A  and  IL  17F 
compared to adalimumab at Week 28 and Week 52. Guselkumab achieved a rapid reduction of serum 
levels of IL-17A and IL-17F at Week 4 with a sustained effect for 12 weeks following last dose at Week 
40. 
Guselkumab also reduced serum IL-22 levels compared to adalimumab at Week 28 and Week 52 with 
a  sustained  effect  for  12  weeks  following  the  last  dose  at  Week  40.  Of  the  additional  exploratory 
markers  that  were  assessed,  both  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  significantly  reduced  peripheral 
CCL22/MDC  at  Week  4  and  Week  16  with  a  sustained  effect  for  12  weeks  following  the  last  dose  at 
Week  40.  Guselkumab  and  adalimumab  showed  a  trend  for  reduction  of  S100A12  at  Week  16  and 
Week  28,  with  a  rebound  observed  following  the  last  dose  at  Week  40.  Adalimumab,  but  not 
guselkumab,  impacted  chemokine  macrophage  inflammatory  protein-1β,  while  both  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab  reduced  peripheral  interleukin  8  (CXCL8/IL-8);  however,  the  effect  with  adalimumab  on 
CXCL8/IL-8 was evident at Week 4 compared to a delayed effect of guselkumab observed at Week 28. 
No impact was observed on the other markers that were measured as part of the exploratory panel. In 
summary,  blockade  of  IL-23  by  guselkumab  limited  production  of  the  effector  cytokines  17A,  IL-17F, 
and IL-22 which are associated with the IL-23/Th17 pathway. This suggests that inhibition of IL-23, a 
key  regulatory  cytokine  that  is  required  to  some  extent  for  the  expansion  of  Th17,  Th22,  ILC3  and 
Tc17 cells, limits production of effector cytokines from IL-17 and IL-22 producing cells. 
CNTO1959PSO3001  was  a  Phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  multicenter,  placebo-  and  active-
comparator-controlled study of guselkumab in subjects with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. 
The  target  population  was  adult  men  and  women,  with  a  diagnosis  of  plaque-type  psoriasis  (with  or 
without  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA))  for  at  least  6  months  before  the  first  administration  of  study  drug. 
Subjects must have had moderate to severe plaquetype psoriasis defined by the Investigator's Global 
Assessment (IGA) ≥ 3, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12, and involved body surface area 
(BSA)  ≥ 10%.  Subjects  must  have  been  candidates  for  either  systemic  therapy  or  phototherapy  for 
psoriasis, and may have previously received some systemic therapies or phototherapy for psoriasis. 
In Study PSO3001, a subset of serum samples was analyzed for 6 analytes across a variety of protein 
classes including cytokines, chemokines and acute phase reactants as follows: 
•  Cytokines:  IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23  
•  Acute Phase Reactants: S100A12  
•  Chemokines: chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1(CXCL)4, CXCL8 
Analyses of a subset of these markers assessed the following objectives: 
Evaluate the PD effects of treatment with guselkumab in a subset of subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque-type psoriasis at Weeks 4, 24, and 48, as compared to baseline. 
Compare  the  PD  effects  of  treatment  with  guselkumab  versus  adalimumab  in  a  subset  of  subjects  at 
Weeks 4, 24, and 48. 
A  subset  of  subjects  (N=40  per  arm)  with  similar  demographic  profiles  was  selected  from  Study 
PSO3001  for  analysis  of  serum  PD  markers.  Overall,  the  primary  analyses  of  this  subset  of  subjects 
from  Study  PSO3001  showed  a  demonstrable  impact  of  guselkumab  on  disease  -  and  mechanism-
related  biomarkers  (eg,  IL-17A,  IL-17F  and  IL-22)  that  were  maintained  or  further  normalized 
following therapy in with guselkumab. IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were significantly reduced at weeks 24

and week 48 (p≤ 0.001) compared to placebo. Guselkumab also reduced IL 17A (p≤ 0.05 at week 48), 
IL-17F  (p≤ 0.05  at  Weeks  4,  24  and  48)  and  IL-22  (p≤ 0.05  at  Weeks  4  and  48)  compared  to 
adalimumab.  These  observations  replicate  findings  from  PSO  2001  with  respect  to  the  capacity  of 
guselkumab to limit the production of effector cytokines IL 17A, IL-17F and IL-22 from IL-17 and IL-22 
producing  cells.  These  data  also  indicate  that  blockade  of  IL-23  in  psoriasis  has  a  greater  impact  on 
effector cytokines associated with the IL-23/Th17 axis compared to blockade of TNFα. 
No secondary pharmacodynamics other than immunogenicity has been investigated.  
The  immunogenicity  of  guselkumab  was  analyzed  using  a  sensitive  and  drug-tolerant  ECLIA  assay  to 
detect  antibodies  to  guselkumab.  Additionally,  all  subjects  positive  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  in 
Phase  2  and  Phase  3  studies  were  assessed  for  the  potential  of  these  antibodies  to  neutralize  the 
bioactivity  of  guselkumab  (ie,  NAbs  to  guselkumab)  using  a  sensitive  and  drug  tolerant  competitive 
ligand binding assay. 
A  total  of  1,730  subjects  in  Phase  2  and  3  psoriasis  studies  who  received  guselkumab  had  post 
treatment  serum  samples that  were  evaluable  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab.  The  overall  incidence  of 
antibodies  to  guselkumab  though  up  to  Week  52  after  exposure  to  guselkumab  was  5.5%  (N=96). 
Titers  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  were  generally  low  with  the  majority  (76  of  96;  79.2%)  being 
≤ 1:160 up to 52 weeks after exposure to guselkumab. 
An  additional  analysis  was  performed  to  determine  the  incidence  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  in 
subjects  who  received  every  scheduled  guselkumab  administration  through  Week  44  and  had  post 
treatment serum samples that were evaluable for antibodies to guselkumab. Among the 562 subjects 
in the PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 6.0%, which was 
consistent  with  the  incidence  of  ADAs  (5.5%)  in  the  overall  study  population  in  the  Phase  2  and  3 
studies. 
In  the  Phase  2  study  (PSO2001),  the development of  antibodies to guselkumab  did  not  appear  to  be 
associated  with  a  reduction  in  the  efficacy  of  guselkumab.  Across  guselkumab  treatment  groups,  all 
(100%) of the 9 subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab achieved a PASI 75 response 
at Week 40, while 167 (78.4%) of the 213 subjects who were negative for antibodies to guselkumab 
achieved  a  PASI  75  response  at  Week  40.  Across  guselkumab  treatment  groups,  5  (55.6%)  of  the  9 
subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  achieved  a  PGA  score  of  cleared  (0)  or 
minimal  (1)  at  Week  40, while  143  (67.1%) of  the 213  subjects  who  were  negative  for  antibodies to 
guselkumab achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) at Week 40. 
In the Phase 3 studies (PSO3001 and PSO3002), the development of antibodies to guselkumab and the 
titer  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  were  not  associated  with  a  reduction  in  the  clinical  efficacy  of 
guselkumab. This was evidenced by the finding that the proportions of subjects who achieved an IGA 
0/1,  IGA  0,  PASI  90,  or  PASI  100  response  at  Week  44  (PSO3001)  or  Week  28  (PSO3002)  were  not 
impacted  by  the  development  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab,  or  the  titer  levels  of  antibodies  to 
guselkumab, through Week 44 (PSO3001) or Week 48 (PSO3002). 
In  the  PSO3003  study,  the  development  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  was  also  not  associated  with  a 
reduction  in  the  clinical  efficacy  of  guselkumab,  as  evidenced  by  the  finding  that  the  proportions  of 
subjects who achieved an IGA 0/1 and at least 2-grade improvement (from Week 16) and a PASI 90 
response  at  Week  36  were  not  impacted  by  the  development  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  through 
Week 36. 
All  96  subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  from  a  total  of  1,730  subjects  in  the 
Phase  2  and  3  studies  in subjects  with  psoriasis  (PSO2001,  PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and  PSO3003)  were

evaluable for NAbs to guselkumab. Seven (7.3%) of 96 subjects were positive for NAbs. Therefore, the 
overall incidence of NAbs in subjects who received guselkumab and had samples that were evaluable 
for ADAs was 0.4% (7/1,730 subjects). 
Psoriasis is strongly associated with certain human leucocyte-associated antigens, especially HLA-
Cw*06:02. Patients who are HLA-Cw*06:02 positive have been reported to have more active disease 
and a younger age at disease onset than HLA-Cw6-negative patients (Gudjonsson JE, Karason A, 
Antonsdottir A, Runarsdottir EH, Hauksson VB, Upmanyu R, Gulcher J, Stefansson K, Valdimarsson H). 
Psoriasis patients who are homozygous for the HLA-Cw*0602 allele has a 2.5-fold increased risk of 
developing psoriasis compared with Cw6 heterozygotes (Br J Dermatol. 2003 Feb; 148(2):233-5.) The 
Applicant has analysed the disease onset characteristics and the therapeutic effects of the IL-12/IL-23 
antagonist ustekinumab. It was confirmed the younger onset age of HLA-C*06:02-positive psoriasis 
patients. According to the published results the IL-12/IL-23 antagonist ustekinumab had somewhat 
better effect in the first 12 weeks of the treatment. Later the effects got rather even in both HLA-
C*06:02-positive and negative patients. Data gained from the guselkumab treated patients are similar 
to those with ustekinumab. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Dose- response study 
In  the  Phase  2  PSO2001  study,  the  proportions  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  PGA  score  of  cleared  or 
minimal and PASI 75 responses were evaluated with respect to steady-state trough serum guselkumab 
concentration  levels  at  Week  16  and  40.  Overall,  subjects  who  had  trough  serum  guselkumab 
concentrations  at  the  highest  quartile  level  at  Week  40  (>0.67  mcg/mL)  had  the  highest  response 
rates  at  Week  40.  Moreover,  only  steady-state  trough  serum  guselkumab  concentrations  at  or  above 
the  highest  quartile  (0.67  mcg/mL)  were  associated  with  PASI  and  PGA  rates  for  all  response 
thresholds that substantially exceeded those reported for existing psoriasis therapies. 
Phase 3 studies 
Phase 3 Studies (PSO3001, PSO3002, and PSO3003) 
In  each  individual  Phase  3  study  in  subjects  with  psoriasis  (PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and  PSO3003),  the 
proportions  of  subjects  who  achieved  an  IGA  0/1,  IGA  0,  PASI  90,  and  PASI  100  responses  were 
evaluated  with  respect  to  steady-state  trough  serum  guselkumab  concentration  levels  to  explore  the 
observed  relationship  between  systemic  guselkumab  exposure  and  clinical  efficacy  (improvement  in 
IGA and PASI response rates). Based on the divergence of study designs after Week 28, data at Week 
44  were  selected  for  Study  PSO3001,  and  the  data  at  Week  28  were  selected  for  PSO3002  because 
they  represented  the  last  steady-state  trough  serum  guselkumab  concentrations  before  the 
randomized withdrawal and retreatment phase. 
With guselkumab 100 mg q8w SC administrations, consistently high efficacy responses were observed 
across  all  four  steady-state  trough  serum  guselkumab  concentration  quartile  levels  in  both  PSO3001 
and PSO3002 studies This is expected since the majority (overall 72.5% in the PSO3001 and PSO3002 
studies  of  subjects  treated  with  the  100  mg  q8w  doses)  achieved  steady-state  trough  serum 
guselkumab  concentrations  >0.67  mcg/mL,  a  level  which  was  associated  with  the  highest  clinical 
responses  in  Phase  2  study  in  subjects  with  psoriasis.  Moreover,  subjects  with  trough  serum 
guselkumab  concentrations  below  the  highest  quartile  had  slightly  lower  IGA  responses,  consistent 
with  the  fact  that  the  100  mg  q8w  dose  regimen  results  in  systemic  guselkumab  exposures  that 
provide  high  efficacy  near,  but  not  at  the  plateau  of  the  exposure-response  curve.  Similar  findings

were  observed  for  PASI  90  and  PASI  100  response  rates  with  respect  to  steady  state  trough  serum 
guselkumab concentration levels. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Guselkumab  is  a  fully  human  immunoglobulin  G1  lambda  (IgG1λ)  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that 
binds to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL 23) with high specificity and affinity. The 
binding characteristics, in vitro efficacy and specificity of guselkumab have been extensively tested in a 
non-clinical  pharmacology  developmental  program.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  guselkumab  is  the 
neutralization of human IL-23 thus inhibiting the IL-17 mediated immune response by the T helper 17 
lymphocytes (Th17L). 
The  PK  properties  of  guselkumab  are  similar  to  other  human  IgG1-type  immunoglobulin-based  mABs 
with  few  specific  characteristics.  It  has  linear  pharmacokinetics  and  besides  body  weight  no  other 
extrinsic or intrinsic factor has a clinically significant effect on the kinetics. However, the bioavailability 
of the product compared to other IgG-based mABs is rather low, only 48.7%.   
At  PK  level  it  was  shown  that  guselkumab  has  a  glycoform  variant  called  M5  which  had  significantly 
shorter  half-life  than  the  other  glycoforms.    This  fact  suggested  a  receptor-mediated  elimination 
pathway.  However,  it  was  agreed  that  this  issue  has  little  clinical  relevance  since  M5  represented 
respectively  less  than  0.8%  of  the  total  amount  of  glycovariants  and  the  kinetics  of  guselkumab  is 
proven to be linear.  
It is expected that the interaction potential of guselkumab is low.  However, suppression inflammatory 
cytokines indirectly can enhance the drug metabolism rate. To address this issue, an additional Phase I 
interaction study (PSO1003) was submitted. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of a single 
SC  dose  of  200  mg  guselkumab  on  the  PK  of  a  cocktail  of  representative  probe  substrates  of  CYP 
isozymes  (midazolam  [CYP3A4],  warfarin  [CYP2C9],  omeprazole  [CYP2C19],  dextromethorphan 
[CYP2D6],  and  caffeine  [CYP1A2]).  Based  on  the  results  of  this  study  it  can  be  concluded  that  the 
metabolic  activities  of  CYP3A4,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  and  CYP1A2  are  not  affected  by  the 
decreased inflammation associated with the improvement of disease activity in subjects with psoriasis.  
These results are also in line with in vitro study using human hepatocytes which showed that IL-23 did 
not alter human CYP450 enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4). The data has been 
appropriately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
Psoriasis  is  a  common  disorder  and  a  number  of  locally  applied  medicines  are  available  to  treat  it. 
Many  of  them  are  available  without  a  prescription.    Phototherapy  (UV-A  and  UV-B)  is  another 
therapeutic modality used in practice. No information was provided on how guselkumab is distributed 
in the skin layers of the patients and how the intradermal distribution is related to the effect observed. 
In theory, the topically applied products could interfere with the action of guselkumab. Therefore, the 
Applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  possibility  of  interactions  between  guselkumab  and  concomitantly 
applied  local  therapeutic  modalities.    In  its  response,  the  Applicant  acknowledged  that  no  data  are 
currently  available  on  the  efficacy  or  safety  and  tolerability  of  concurrent  phototherapy  or  topical 
treatments  in  psoriasis  patients  being  treated  with  guselkumab.  In  fact,  the  use  of  any  additional 
active  psoriasis  systemic  or  topical  treatments  was  prohibited  during  the  first  48  weeks  of  studies 
PSO3001  and  PSO3002  which  is  consistent  with  nearly  all  other  randomized  clinical  trials  of  biologic 
agents in psoriasis performed to date. 
There are, however, published results from several clinical trials that have investigated the addition of 
topical  psoriasis  therapies  to  biologics  with  the  intent  of  maintaining  initial  responses.  The  currently 
available data, though limited, suggest that using topical therapies as an adjunct treatment to biologics

is  a  well-tolerated  and  effective  means  of  controlling  psoriasis  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  for 
patients.  A  recent  publication  that  reviewed  the  available  published  data  on  combining  biologic  and 
phototherapy treatments for moderate-to- severe psoriasis concluded that 9 out of 10 of the published 
studies included, demonstrated favourable efficacy and safety for combining biologic and phototherapy.   
Based  on  the  response  it  has  been  concluded  that  additional  explicit  warning  regarding  concomitant 
local therapy is not needed.  
At  the  SmPC  recommended  posology,  the  steady-state  plasma  levels  will  be  in  the  range  where  the 
maximum therapeutic effect is expected. However, from the literature, it was known that obesity itself 
is a contributing pathological factor. Therefore additional analysis was suggested to check the benefit 
of  dose  adjustment  for  obese  patients  using  BMI  instead  of  BWT  as  an  indicator  for  obesity.    The 
additional  POP-PK/PD  analysis  and  simulations  demonstrated  that  BMI  and  BWT  are  equally  good 
predictors,  and  a  specific  obesity-related  effect  could  not  be  demonstrated.    Therefore  BMI-based 
dosing is not warranted. 
Biomarker data was collected from a phase 1, a phase 2 and the phase 3 PSO3001 studies.  
The  biomarker  analyses  have  adequately  proven  the  mechanism  of  action  of  guselkumab  in  humans. 
The changes of serum levels of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were decreased by time and levelled around 
week 24 parallel with the improvement of psoriasis symptoms (please, refer to efficacy analyses). 
Overall,  the  findings  from  the  histological  analyses  are  consistent  with  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
guselkumab and with the clinical efficacy observed. 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamics  other  than  immunogenicity  has  been  addressed  by  the  Applicant. 
Since guselkumab shows high specificity to IL-23 proven by the non-clinical pharmacology studies, and 
non-clinical  safety  and  toxicology  studies  have  not  revealed  any  unexpected  effects,  secondary 
pharmacodynamics (off-target related effects) are not expected. The Fc fragment of guselkumab is not 
involved  in  the  mechanism  of  action  and  no  complement  activation  has  been  observed  either.  The 
immunogenicity of guselkumab was analysed using a sensitive and drug-tolerant ECLIA assay to detect 
antibodies  to  guselkumab.  Additionally,  all  subjects  positive  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  in  Phase  2 
and Phase 3 studies were assessed for the potential of these antibodies to neutralize the bioactivity of 
guselkumab  (ie,  NAbs  to  guselkumab)  using  a  sensitive  and  drug  tolerant  competitive  ligand  binding 
assay. The overall incidence of antibodies against guselkumab was low (96 subjects of 1730, 5.5%). Of 
this  96  of  subjects  7  were  positive  for  neutralizing  antibodies.  Efficacy  was  not  influenced  by  the 
antibodies. For detailed analysis, please, refer to the efficacy and safety sections of the report. 
There were no clinical studies designed and conducted to evaluate pharmacodynamic interactions with 
other medicinal products. Since guselkumab is a highly specific monoclonal antibody against IL-23 and 
it  has  no  other  efficacy  targets,  pharmacodynamic  interactions  are  not  anticipated.    The  lack  of 
interaction data is reflected in the SmPC (please see SmPC section 4.5). 
Psoriasis is strongly associated with certain human leucocyte-associated antigens, especially HLA-
Cw*06:02. Patients who are HLA-Cw*06:02 positive have been reported to have more active disease 
and a younger age at disease onset than HLA-Cw6-negative patients (Gudjonsson JE, Karason A, 
Antonsdottir A, Runarsdottir EH, Hauksson VB, Upmanyu R, Gulcher J, Stefansson K, Valdimarsson H). 
Psoriasis patients who are homozygous for the HLA-Cw*0602 allele have a 2.5-fold increased risk of 
developing psoriasis compared with Cw6 heterozygotes. (Br J Dermatol. 2003 Feb; 148(2):233-5). The 
Applicant has analysed the disease onset characteristics and the therapeutic effects of the IL-12/IL-23 
antagonist ustekinumab and the specific IL-23 antagonist guselkumab, confirming the younger onset 
age of HLA-C*06:02-positive psoriasis patients. Guselkumab was at least as effective in HLA-
Cw*06:02 positive patients as in the HLA-Cw*06:02 negative ones.  
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 46/148 
 
 
 
 
 
From a pharmacodynamics point of view it is worth noting that the mechanism of action of guselkumab 
is most likely the same in the HLA-C*06:02-positive subjects as in the HLA-C*06:02-negative ones. 
Due to the small sample size firm conclusion cannot be drawn whether guselkumab may even be more 
efficient in HLA-C* 06:02-positive subjects. Nevertheless the data indicate that the therapeutic effect 
of guselkumab is present and at least as pronounced as in the HLA-C*06:02-negative subjects. 
This genetic difference might even improve but definitely does not impair the effect of guselkumab 
although further data would be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of the genetic difference on the 
therapeutic effect of guselkumab. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A firm relationship has been demonstrated between dose, plasma concentration and the therapeutic 
effect. Biomarkers have been evaluated in three clinical studies. Guselkumab efficiently reduced the 
biomarkers related to psoriasis and showed more efficiency than the TNFα antagonist adalimumab. The 
proof of concept has been justified.  The clinical pharmacology data submitted in support of this 
marketing authorisation is considered acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study  PSO1001  (phase  1,  proof-of-concept)  demonstrated  proof  of  concept  of  guselkumab 
efficacy in psoriasis subjects at all guselkumab dose levels examined (10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, and 300 
mg  single  doses),  and  all  doses  were  well  tolerated.  PK  analysis  showed  that  guselkumab  exhibited 
approximately  dose  proportional  PK  across  the  dose  range  tested  with  a  mean  half-life  of 
approximately  17  days.  Based  on  preliminary  exposure-response  modeling  and  simulation,  a  Phase  2 
dose ranging study (PSO2001) including five dose levels (5, 15, 50, 100, and 200 mg) and two dosing 
intervals (q8w and q12w) was conducted to further characterize the guselkumab dose- and exposure-
response in psoriasis. 
Study PSO2001 (phase 2, “X-PLORE”)  
The  Phase  2  study  PSO2001  was  a  randomized,  placebo-  and  active-comparator-controlled, 
multicenter dose-ranging study of guselkumab in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A 
total of 293 subjects were randomized in the study.  
Two dose regimens were evaluated in this study:  
q8w dosing for the 15 and 100 mg arms (Weeks 0, 8, and q8w thereafter through Week 40) and  
q12w  dosing  after  induction  doses  for  the  5,  50,  and  200  mg  arms  (Weeks  0,  4,  16,  and  q12w 
thereafter through Week 40). 
Subjects  were  to  be  randomly  allocated  in  equal  proportions  to  1  of  7  groups  to  receive:  placebo,  5 
dose groups for guselkumab (5 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 then every 12 weeks [q12w] through Week 40, 
15 mg every 8 weeks [q8w], 50 mg at Week 0 and Week 4 then q12w, 100 mg q8w, and 200 mg at 
Weeks  0  and  4  then  q12w),  or  open-label  adalimumab  (80  mg  SC  at  Week  0  followed  by  40  mg  SC 
administration at Week 1 and every other week through Week 39).

Figure 2 - Schematic Overview of Study PSO2001 
The results of study PSO2001 showed efficacy in all guselkumab doses studied. A significantly greater 
proportion  of  subjects  in  each  guselkumab  dose  group  achieved  a  PGA  of  cleared  (0)  or  minimal  (1) 
(all  p≤0.002)  and  PASI  75  (all  p<0.001)  at  Week 16  than in the  placebo  group.  Also,  a  substantially 
greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab 50 mg q12w, 100 mg q8w, and 200 mg q12w groups 
achieved PGA 0/1 than in the adalimumab group at Week 16. When comparing q8w versus q12w dose 
regimens,  a  loss  of  efficacy  toward  the  end  of  each  dosing  interval  was  evident  for  the  q12w  dosing 
groups that were not apparent among subjects receiving q8w dosing. Therefore, it was concluded that 
a q8w dosing interval would provide a more sustained efficacy than a q12w dosing interval.  
A  clear  dose-response  in  efficacy  was  observed  across  several  clinically  important  PASI  and  IGA 
measures  of  response  from  the  5  mg  dose  regimen  up  to  the  100  mg  dose  regimen.  The  dose 
response was most apparent at the higher PASI and PGA thresholds (eg, PASI 90 and 100 responses, 
and  PGA  0).  For  example,  PASI  100  response  rates  of  9.8%,  12.2%,  19.0%,  33.3%  and  28.6  %  at 
Week  16  were  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  5  mg,  15  mg,  50 mg,  100  mg  and  200  mg  dosing 
regimens, respectively. The study results therefore showed that the 100 mg q8w dose regimen had the 
best  efficacy  among  all  dose  regimens  studied.  Dose  regimens  lower  than  100  mg  q8w  were 
consistently less  effective and  the  dose  regimen  of 200  mg  q12w  did  not  provide  incremental  benefit 
over 100 mg q8w.

At  Week  16,  all  guselkumab  groups  had  significantly  greater  improvements  (ie,  decreases)  in  DLQI 
scores  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  In  addition,  a  significantly  greater proportion  of  subjects  in 
all  guselkumab  groups  achieved  a  DLQI  score  of  0  or  1,  indicating  that  was  little  or  no  effect  of 
psoriasis  on  subjects  health  related  quality  of  life,  at  Week  16  compared  with  the  placebo  group. 
Subjects in a higher dose group were more likely to achieve a DLQI score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 than

those  in  lower  dose  groups,  indicating  a  dose-response  relationship.  DLQI  score  improvements 
achieved at Week 16 were sustained through Week 28 and Week 52 in all guselkumab groups, and the 
improvements were generally comparable with the adalimumab group. 
A  clear  exposure-response  relationship  was  also  evident  in  analyses  based  on  clinical  response  by 
trough serum guselkumab concentrations in study PSO2001 (see PK section).  
Based on the clear dose- and exposure response relationships defined in Phase 2, and a goal of 
maintaining trough serum guselkumab concentrations ≥ 0.67 μg/mL in the majority of subjects so that 
the highest efficacy level could be achieved, the 100 mg q8w dose regimen was selected for study in 
Phase 3. To expedite the onset of response, a loading dose of 100 mg guselkumab was also given at 
Week 4 prior to 100 mg q8w maintenance dosing in the Phase 3 program. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
A  global  Phase  3  program  consisting  of  3  studies  (PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and  PSO3003)  is  ongoing  to 
investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  SC  guselkumab  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque 
psoriasis.  Guselkumab  treatment  was  compared  with  adalimumab  treatment  in  both  PSO3001  and 
PSO3002.  Study  PSO3003  examined  the  efficacy  of  guselkumab  in  subjects  with  an  inadequate 
response  to  ustekinumab.  The  longer-term  efficacy and  safety  of  guselkumab  is  being  assessed  in  4-
year extensions of studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 (ie, both studies will have an overall study duration 
of 5 years). 
The Phase 3 clinical development program for guselkumab included 2,700 adult subjects (837 in 
PSO3001, 992 in PSO3002, and 871 in PSO3003) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 
encountered in clinical practice, who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The target population for the guselkumab global Phase 3 clinical program was adults with moderate to 
severe plaque-type psoriasis (with or without PsA) for at least 6 months prior to first administration of 
study agent. Moderate to severe plaque type psoriasis was defined as an IGA ≥3, PASI ≥12, and BSA 
≥10%. Subjects must have been candidates for either systemic therapy or phototherapy for psoriasis, 
and  may  have  previously  received  some  systemic  therapies  or  phototherapy  for  psoriasis.  Subjects 
with  nonplaque  forms  of  psoriasis  (eg,  erythrodermic,  guttate,  or  pustular)  or  with  drug-induced 
psoriasis  (eg,  a  new  onset  of  psoriasis  or  an  exacerbation  of  psoriasis  from  beta  blockers,  calcium 
channel  blockers,  or  lithium)  were  excluded.  Following  patients  were  also  excluded:  those  who  had 
concurrent  active  infection  or  history  or  latent  or  active  granulomatous  infection  (including  TB), 
nontuberculous  mycobacterial infection,  serious  opportunistic  infection,  chronic  or  recurrent infectious 
disease,  or  infection  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV),  hepatitis  B,  or  hepatitis  C,  history  of 
malignancy or those who underwent organ transplantation or had serious zoster infection.Subjects who 
had  ever  received  guselkumab  were  excluded  from  all  Phase  3  studies,  while  subjects  who  had  ever 
received adalimumab were excluded from studies PSO3001 and PSO3002, and subjects who had ever 
received ustekinumab were excluded from study PSO3003.

Treatments 
Global  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  are  placebo-  and  active-comparator  controlled  studies  with 
identical  study  designs  through  Week  24,  to  assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and 
immunogenicity of guselkumab in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidate 
for phototherapy or systemic therapy (Figure 5 and Figure 6).

The  designs  then  diverge  beyond  Week  24,  with  each  study  addressing  a  distinct  aspect  of  psoriasis 
treatment  between  Weeks  24  and  48.  In  the  PSO3001  study,  treatment  of  subjects  randomized  to 
guselkumab  and  adalimumab  continued  through  Week  48  to  allow  for  a  robust  evaluation  of  the 
durability  of  response  and  comparative  efficacy  and  safety  during  one  year  of  continuous  treatment. 
Study  PSO3002  incorporated  randomized  withdrawal  and  retreatment  design  elements  from  Week 28 
and beyond, to formally assess the efficacy and safety of guselkumab maintenance dosing relative to 
withdrawal of treatment in PASI 90 responders.  
Study  PSO3002  also  provides  efficacy  and  safety  information  on  adalimumab PASI  90  nonresponders 
who transitioned to guselkumab treatment at Week 28. A total of 837 subjects were randomized to the 
placebo (n=174), guselkumab (n=329) or adalimumab (n=334) groups in study PSO3001 and a total 
of  992  subjects  were  randomized  to  the  placebo  (n=248),  guselkumab  (n=496),  and  adalimumab 
(n=248) in study PSO3002. Results for both studies reported in this submission reflect data available 
through the Week 48 database lock. 
Self-administration  of  study  drug  was  incorporated  in  the  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  studies.  Subjects 
were trained to self-administer study drug at the study site at Week 0 using the liquid formulation in 
prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  assembled  with  a  passive  needle  guard  (PFS-U),  which  is  to  be  the  marketed 
presentation of guselkumab. After appropriate training, subjects self-administered study drug at home 
through  Week  47  in  PSO3001  and  through  Week 23  in  PSO3002.  Starting  at  Week  28  in  study 
PSO3002,  subjects  self-administered  study  drug  at  the  study  site  due  to  the  less  frequent  dosing 
during  the  randomized  withdrawal  and  retreatment  phase  of  the  study.  The  following  doses  were 
applied:  guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter, placebo beginning 
at Week 0 followed by guselkumab 100 mg at Week 16 and Week 20 , adalimumab (80 mg at Week 0 
followed by adalimumab 40 mg at Week 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter (q2w) and ustekinumab dose 
of 45 mg or 90 mg (according to the subject’s baseline [week 0] weight) at Weeks 0 and 4. At Week 
16 and every 12 weeks (q12w). 
The  third  global  Phase  3  study  (PSO3003)  used  an  enrichment  study  design  to  assess  the  benefit  of 
guselkumab treatment in subjects who demonstrated an inadequate response (IGA≥2) to ustekinumab 
after 16 weeks of treatment. The target population enrolled at Week 0 for PSO3003 shared similar key 
eligibility  criteria  to  that  defined  for  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002,  ie  subjects  with  moderate  to 
severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and similar exclusion 
criteria  were  applied.  A  total  of  871  subjects  were  enrolled  and  received  open-label  ustekinumab.  At 
Week  16,  subjects  with  an  IGA  ≥2  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  initiate  guselkumab  100 
mg  at  Weeks  16  and  20,  and  q8w  thereafter  or  continue  on  ustekinumab  q12w.  Visits  were  every  4 
weeks (q4w) through Week 44 for efficacy and safety evaluations, with an additional follow-up visit at 
Week 52 and a final safety visit at Week 60. The objective of study was intended to provide guidance 
for  clinicians  for  those  patients  that  have  not  achieved  a  satisfactory  psoriasis  response  prior  to 
administration  of  ustekinumab.  Data  for  study  PSO3003  reported  in  this  submission  reflect  data 
available through the Week 40 database lock.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Endpoints  
Key  measures  used  to  evaluate  efficacy  of  guselkumab  in  both  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002 
included:  
• 
Psoriasis improvement measures: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigator’s 
Global Assessment (IGA). Notably, the Sponsor modified the 6-point PGA by collapsing the 2 highest 
categories  (marked  [4]  and  severe  [5])  into  1  (severe  [4]).  This  modified  5-point  static  global 
assessment  was  used  in  the  guselkumab  Phase  3  program,  and  is  referred  to  as  the  Investigator 
Global Assessment (IGA) to distinguish it from the 6-point PGA used previously in study PSO2001. 
• 
Regional  psoriasis  measures:  Scalp  Specific  Investigator  Global  Assessment  (ss-IGA), 
Physician’s Global Assessment of Hands and/or Feet (hf-PGA), Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), 
and fingernail PGA (f-PGA)  
• 
Patient-reported outcomes measures (PRO):  
Dermatology Life Quality of Index (DLQI) 
Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD). It is a PRO instrument that has been designed and 
validated  by  the  Sponsor  to  measure  the  severity  of  psoriasis  symptoms  and  signs  for  the 
assessment of treatment benefit.   
Additional patient-reported outcome efficacy measures only used in study PSO3002 included the 36-
item  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36),  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS),  and  Work 
Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ). 
The primary and major secondary endpoints evaluated for the Phase 3 psoriasis studies are presented 
by order of testing in table 14 and table 15. Multiplicity was controlled using fixed sequence testing for 
both the primary and major secondary endpoints in all studies. Studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 shared 
the  same  co-primary  endpoints  and  major  secondary  endpoints  through  Week  24.  The  endpoints  at 
Week  48  focused  on  guselkumab  comparisons  with  adalimumab  in  PSO3001  and  a  randomized 
assessment of efficacy of maintenance of therapy compared with withdrawal in PSO3002. Endpoints in 
study  PSO3003  were  from  Week  28  through  Week 40  and  focused  on  comparisons  of  guselkumab  to 
ustekinumab  in  subjects  who  were  ustekinumab  inadequate  responders  (IGA≥2)  at  Week  16  and 
randomized to guselkumab or ustekinumab at Week 16.

a To control the overall Type 1 error rate (p=0.05), the primary analysis and major secondary analyses were tested using a fixed sequence method. Specifically, the 
first major secondary endpoint was tested only if the co-primary endpoints were positive, and subsequent endpoints were tested only if the preceding 
endpoint in the sequence was positive. 
b Tested for superiority of the guselkumab group compared with the adalimumab group. 
c Tested for noninferiority of the guselkumab group compared with the adalimumab group for the three endpoints in the above order before any of the superiority 
tests for the same endpoints in the above order.

Since studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 were large and each provided a robust estimate of guselkumab 
efficacy, these two studies were not pooled for estimating efficacy rates. Instead, the results of each of 
these studies are presented side by side to allow for an assessment of consistency. However, efficacy 
data  were  pooled  from  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  to  evaluate  efficacy  in  subpopulations,  efficacy  by 
serum  guselkumab  concentration  at  trough  level,  and  efficacy  by  antibody  to  guselkumab  status  to 
increase the sample size and precision for these evaluations.

Sample size 
Study CNTO1959PSO3001 
The  assumptions  for  the  sample  size  and  power  calculations  were  based  on  the  data  from  the 
guselkumab CNTO1959PSO2001 study. 
Based on the assumptions (more detail in the protocol), with a total of approximately 750 subjects to 
be  randomized  in  a  2:1:2  ratio  to  guselkumab  100  mg  q8w  (n=300),  placebo  (n=150),  and 
adalimumab (n=300) at Week 0: 
• 
• 
• 
There  was  >99%  power  to  detect  significant  differences  for  both  co-primary  endpoints  in  the 
proportion of subjects achieving an IGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) and the proportion 
of subjects who achieved a PASI 90 response between the placebo and guselkumab groups at 
Week 16, at a significance level of 0.05. 
There was >99% power to detect significant differences in the proportion of subjects achieving 
an  IGA  score  of  cleared  (0)  between  the  adalimumab  and  guselkumab  groups  at  Week  24  or 
Week 48 at a significance level of 0.05. 
There  was  at  least  97%  power  to  detect  significant  differences  in  the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving an IGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) between the adalimumab and guselkumab 
groups at Week 24 or Week 48 at a significance level of 0.05. 
There was at least 90% power to detect a 12 percentage-point difference in the proportion of subjects 
achieving  a  PASI  75  response  between  the  adalimumab  and  guselkumab  groups  at  Week  16  at  a 
significance level of 0.05. 
Study CNTO1959PSO3002 
The  assumptions  for  the  sample  size  and  power  calculations  were  based  on  the  data  from  the 
guselkumab CNTO1959PSO2001 study. 
Based on the above assumptions, with a total of approximately 1,000 subjects to be randomized in a 
2:1:1 ratio to guselkumab 100 mg q8w (n=500), placebo (n=250), and adalimumab (n=250) at Week 
0: 
• 
• 
• 
There  was  >99%  power  to  detect  significant  differences  for  both  co-primary  endpoints  in  the 
proportion of subjects achieving an IGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) and the proportion 
of  subjects  achieving  a  PASI  90  response  between  the  placebo  and  guselkumab  groups  at 
Week 16, at a significance level of 0.05. 
There  was  at  least  98%  power  to  detect  significant  differences  in  the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving an IGA score of cleared (0) and IGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) between the 
adalimumab and guselkumab groups at Week 24 at a significance level of 0.05. 
The  assumption  was  made  that  approximately  70%  of  the  subjects  originally  randomized  to 
guselkumab were to be PASI 90 responders (based on the CNTO1959PSO2001 data) and were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive guselkumab 100 mg q8w or undergo withdrawal of 
guselkumab  at  Week  28.  This  ensured  at  least  90%  power  to  detect  a  15-percentage-point 
difference in PASI 90 response rates at Week 48 between these 2 groups at a significance level 
of 0.05.

In addition, there was at least 90% power to detect a 12-percentage-point difference in the proportion 
of  subjects  achieving  a  PASI  75  response  between  the  adalimumab  and  guselkumab  groups  at  Week 
16 at a significance level of 0.05. 
Study CNTO1959PSO3003 
The  sample  size  was  chosen  to  achieve  at  least  90%  power  to  detect  treatment  differences  between 
ustekinumab and guselkumab for the primary and major secondary endpoints at a significance level of 
0.05 (2-sided). 
For  subjects  who  continued  on  ustekinumab  treatment,  the  assumptions  for  sample  size  and  power 
calculations  were  based  on  data  from  the  ustekinumab  Phase  3  psoriasis  studies  (C0743T08  and 
C0743T09). 
For  subjects  who  switched  from  ustekinumab  to  guselkumab,  the  assumptions  for  sample  size  and 
power  calculations  were  derived  by  comparing  the  ustekinumab  response  rates  in  the  ustekinumab 
Phase 3 psoriasis studies (C0743T08 and C0743T09) with those from the guselkumab X-PLORE study 
With  approximately  800  subjects  receiving  open-label  ustekinumab  (45  mg  for  those  with  baseline 
[Week  0]  weight  ≤100  kg  and  90  mg  for  those  with  baseline  [Week  0]  weight  >100  kg)  at  Week  0, 
assuming  5%  of  the  subjects  discontinued  study  drug  before  Week  16,  it  was  expected  that 
approximately 260 subjects would achieve an IGA≥2 and be randomized in a 1:1 ratio at Week 16 to 
either switch to guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 16 and 20 and then q8w thereafter, or continue in the 
ustekinumab treatment group. 
Based  on  the  efficacy  assumptions  at  various  time  point  (weeks  16-40)130  subjects  per  treatment 
group would have approximately 98% power to detect the treatment difference at a significance level 
of 0.05. 
Sufficient power (>90%) could also be achieved assuming a smaller treatment effect. 
Randomisation 
Studies CNTO1959PSO3001 and CNTO1959PSO3002 (VOYAGE I and II) 
At  Week  0,  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  1  of  3  treatment  groups  (guselkumab  100  mg, 
placebo, and adalimumab) in a 2:1:2 ratio in study 3001, and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups  in  study  3002  based  on  a  computer-generated  randomization  schedule).  Permuted  block 
randomization with stratification by investigator site was used. 
In  study  3002,  at  Week  28,  subjects  randomized  to  guselkumab  100  mg  q8w  who  were  PASI  90 
responders were rerandomized using the IWRS either to placebo or guselkumab 100 mg q8w in a 1:1 
ratio. 
Study CNTO1959PSO3003 (NAVIGATE) 
Approximately  260  subjects  with  an  inadequate  (IGA≥2)  response  to  ustekinumab  at  Week  16  were 
planned  to  be  randomly  assigned  to  1  of  2  treatment  groups  (guselkumab  [n=130],  ustekinumab 
[n=130]) in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization was based on a dynamic randomization method, stratified 
by site and baseline (Week 0) weight (≤100 kg, >100 kg) with a biased coin assignment.

Blinding (masking) 
Studies CNTO1959PSO3001 and CNTO1959PSO3002 (VOYAGE I and II) 
Studies were double blinded until week 48. 
To maintain blind, subjects received 2 types of syringes. Subjects randomized to guselkumab received 
guselkumab  (and  placebo  for  guselkumab  at  Week  16  only)  in  PFS-U  and  placebo  for  adalimumab. 
Subjects  randomized  to  placebo  received:  placebo  for  guselkumab  in  PFS-U  and  placebo  for 
adalimumab. Subjects randomized to adalimumab received adalimumab and placebo for guselkumab. 
Study CNTO1959PSO3003 (NAVIGATE) 
Open-label ustekinumab treatment period was followed by a double blind phase. 
Statistical methods 
For  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002,  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  chi-square  test  stratified  by 
investigator  site  was  used  to  compare  the  proportion  of  subjects  responding  to  treatment.  For  study 
PSO3003, CMH mean scores test stratified by baseline (Week 0) weight (≤100 kg, >100 kg) was used 
to compare the number of visits during which a clinical response was observed from Week 28 through 
Week  40.  Continuous  response  parameters  were  compared  using  an  analysis  of  variance  model  or 
rank-based analysis of variance with investigator site as a covariate (PSO3001 and PSO3002) or with 
baseline  (Week  0)  weight  (PSO3003)  as  a  covariate.  Log-rank  test  stratified  by  investigator  site  was 
used  to  compare  the  time  to  event  endpoint  in  PSO3002.  All  statistical  testing  for  superiority  was 
performed 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05 and for non-inferiority 1-sided at a significance level 
of 0.025 for both studies PSO3001 and PSO3002. 
To  control  the  overall  Type  1  error  rate  of  0.05,  the  primary  analysis  and  major  secondary  analyses 
were tested in a fixed sequence in the order shown in Table 14 (PSO3001 and PSO3002) and Table 15 
(PSO3003). That is, the first major secondary endpoint was tested only if the primary endpoint(s) was 
positive,  and  the  subsequent  endpoint  was  tested  only  if  the  preceding  major  secondary  endpoint  in 
the sequence was positive. Nominal p-values were reported for all other secondary analyses. 
Subjects who discontinued the study agent due to lack of efficacy or an adverse event of worsening of 
psoriasis, or who started a protocol-prohibited medication/therapy during the study that could improve 
psoriasis  were  considered  treatment  failures.  The  baseline  values  were  assigned  regardless  of  the 
observed data for continuous endpoints, zero was assigned to improvement and percent improvement, 
and  non-responder  status  was  assigned  to  binary  response  variables.  After  applying  the  treatment 
failure rules, remaining missing data were in general handled as follows: 
•  Nonresponder imputation was applied for binary endpoints. 
•  Last observation carried forward was applied for continuous variables. 
Additionally,  the  randomization  method 
for  study  PSO3003  was  performed  using  dynamic 
randomization  with  a  bias  coin  assignment  to  accommodate  the  stratification  by  both  weight  and 
investigator  site.  A  sensitivity  analysis  using  a  re-randomization  test  for  the  primary  endpoint  was 
performed.

Conduct of the study 
Study CNTO1959PSO3001 
Database locks (DBLs) were planned to occur at Weeks 48 and 160.  
Change in conduct 
There  were  2  amendments  (issued  12  February  2015  and  17  February  2016)  to  the  original  protocol 
issued on 10 July 2014. The first amendment was considered substantial, and the overall reason was 
to  address  the  regulatory,  ethics  committee,  and  investigator  feedback.  The  key  changes  done, 
ensured  consistency,  in  the  assessments  and  the  timepoints,  across  all  the  guselkumab  Phase  3 
psoriasis protocols. 
Protocol deviations 
Through  Week  48,  106  (12.7%)  subjects  had  119  MPDs,  for  which  the  proportion  were  comparable 
across  the  3  treatment  groups.  Twenty-six  (3.1%)  subjects  entered  the  study  but  did  not  satisfy 
criteria.  Seven  (0.8%)  subjects  received  prohibited  concomitant  medication.  Twenty-four  (2.9%) 
subjects  received  wrong  treatment  or  incorrect  dose.  Fifty-five  (6.6%)  subjects  had  a  total  of  59 
deviations that were categorized as “Other” (consent, pregnancy, storage of drugs, etc.).  
The proportion of subjects missing at least 1 study agent injection (which includes both active and 
placebo injections) was comparable among the treatment groups. The proportion of subjects who 
missed at least 1 study agent injection was relatively high due to the schedule of injections occurring 
every 2 weeks. The proportion of subjects that missed at least 1 active injection was substantially 
higher in the adalimumab group because of the much larger number of total active injections required 
by the established dosing regimen

The original protocol was issued on 10 July 2014. There was 2 amendments to the protocol.  
The first one (issued 12 February 2015) was considered substantial and was adopted before any study 
related procedures began. This amendment included the following major changes: 
•  Assessments describing antibodies to study agent were added at Week 16 and Week 44. 
•  A  physical  examination  and  weight  measurement  were  moved  to  Week  100  from  Week  108, 
and added at Week 148. 
• 
• 
The  inclusion  criteria  were  clarified  to  indicate  that  barrier  methods  should  be  used  with  a 
spermicidal agent if spermicidal agents are available in their locale. 
The  exclusion  criterion  for  major  surgery  was  clarified.  The  text  describing  serious  adverse 
event  (SAE)  reporting  for  hospitalization  was  edited  to  address  a  potential  contradiction  with 
this exclusion criterion. 
•  An exclusion criterion was added to exclude sponsor employees from participation in the study. 
Amendment  2  (issued  25  June  2015)  was  considered  substantial.  The  overall  reason  for  the 
amendment was to restrict the use of concomitant medications for psoriasis through Week 76 instead 
of through Week 48. 
Protocol deviations 
Through  Week  48,  186  (18.8%)  subjects  had  221  MPDs,  for  which  the  proportion  were  comparable 
across the 3 treatment groups. 
Database lock: Database locks (DBL) were planned to occur at Weeks 48 and 160.  
Study CNTO1959PSO3003 
Two database locks (DBL) were planned for this study: one at Week 40 and one at Week 60. This CSR 
reports  data  from  the  Week  40  DBL.  Start:  07  October  2014  (First  subject  screened)  .  To:    25 
December 2015 (Last study visit for last subject). 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was issued on 03 July 2014. There was 1 amendment (issued 12 February 2015) 
to  the  protocol,  which  was  considered  substantial.  The  overall  reason  for  the  amendment  was  to 
address  health  authority,  ethics  committee,  and  investigator  feedback.  This  amendment  included  the 
following major changes: 
• 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) collection timepoints were added beyond Week 0 (Weeks 16, 32, and 
52) to obtain additional ECG measurements for safety assessment in randomized subjects only. 
•  A  physical  examination  and  a  urine  pregnancy  test  were  added  at  Week  52.  An  additional 
discontinuation  criterion  was  added  for  subjects  who  experience  signs  and  symptoms 
suspicious for reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. 
• 
Information was added about the presence of dry natural rubber on the ustekinumab prefilled 
syringe  (PFS)  needle  cover,  which  might  cause  allergic  reactions  in  individuals  sensitive  to 
latex. 
Protocol deviations 
Through  Week  16,  45  (5.2%)  subjects  had  MPDs.  From  Week  16  though  Week  40,  20  (7.5%) 
randomized subjects had MPDs. (see Table below)

Table 20 - Summary of Subjects With Major Protocol Deviations From Week 16 through Week 40; 
Randomized Subjects (Study CNTO1959PSO3003) 
From Week 16 through Week 40, 6 (1.0%) subjects who continued to receive open-label treatment 
had major protocol deviations. 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar across studies PSO3001, 
PSO3002,  and  PSO3003  and  balanced  across  treatment  groups  within  each  study.  The  majority  of 
subjects were male and white. The mean age and weight across studies ranged, from 43 to 44 years 
and 89 to 90 kg, respectively. 
All subjects had moderate or severe psoriasis, based on baseline BSA, PASI, and IGA scores. The mean 
disease duration  was  about  17  years.  Approximately  19% of  subjects  reported  a  diagnosis  of  PsA.  In 
PSO3001  and  PSO3002,  the  vast  majority  (approx.  85%)  of  subjects  had  scalp  psoriasis,  more  than 
half of the subjects had nail psoriasis, and less than one-third of subjects had hand or foot psoriasis. In 
addition, most subjects enrolled had significant impairment in quality of life, as evidenced by a mean 
baseline  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (DLQI)  score  of  approximately  14.5.  These  clinical  disease 
characteristics  are  consistent  with  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  and  consistent  with  observations  in 
previous clinical studies of biologic agents in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.  
Prior  psoriasis  medication  histories  of  subjects  enrolled  in  the  Phase  3  studies  were  similar  and 
consistent  with  a  population  of  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  subjects.  In  studies  PSO3001  and 
PSO3002,  approximately  30%  of  subjects  were  naïve  to  prior  non-biologic  systemic  and  biologic 
psoriasis  treatments  at  the  time  of  study  entry.  Fewer  subjects  in  PSO3003  used  non-biologic  or 
biologic  systemic  therapies  and  41.2%  were  naïve  to  any  nonbiologic  or  biologic  systemic  psoriasis 
therapies.

Study CNTO1959PSO3001 
The primary efficacy population in this study included all subjects randomized at Week 0 (randomized 
analysis set). For all efficacy analyses, subjects were analyzed according to the randomized treatment 
group to which they were assigned, regardless of the treatment they actually received. Of note, only 1 
subject  was  randomized  but  not  treated  in  the  study;  the  subject  had  been  randomized  to  the 
adalimumab treatment group . This subject was included in the efficacy analyses. 
A total of 49 subjects were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. No subjects in the placebo group 
were  excluded  from  the  per-protocol  population.  Twelve  (3.6%)  subjects  were  assigned  to  the 
guselkumab  group;  the  remaining  37  (11.1%)  subjects  were  assigned  to  the  adalimumab  group.  In 
both treatment groups, the majority of subjects excluded from the analyses were due to not receiving 
the required active study agent.

Psoriasis improvement through week 24 
Studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  demonstrated  robust  efficacy  of  guselkumab,  with  both  studies 
meeting their co-primary and all multiplicity adjusted major secondary endpoints through Week 24 (all 
p<0.001). At Week 16, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab group achieved 
an  IGA  0  and  IGA  0/1  scores,  and  PASI  100,  PASI  90,  and  PASI  75  responses  compared  with  the 
placebo group and for IGA 0/1, PASI 90, and PASI 75 compared to the adalimumab group . At Week 
24, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab group achieved an IGA 0, IGA 0/1, 
and PASI 100, PASI 90, and PASI 75 responses compared with the adalimumab group. 
IGA  scores  and  PASI  responses  were  consistent  for  each  treatment  group  in  both  studies  and 
comparable across the 2 studies, thus the magnitude of treatment differences was consistent between 
the 2 studies for guselkumab compared with placebo and adalimumab. 
The onset of clinical efficacy, measured by IGA 0/1 and PASI 90 response, occurred as early as Week 2 
in  both  studies  (PSO3001  and  PS03002).  Additionally,  by  Week  8  in  both  studies,  guselkumab 
treatment  responses  also  separated  from  those  of  adalimumab.  The  response  separation  between 
guselkumab and adalimumab continued to increase and reached a maximum around Week 16 and 20 
for  IGA  0/1  and  PASI  90  response,  respectively,  and  was  maintained  through  Week  24.  Consistent 
results were also observed for IGA 0 and PASI 100.

Study PSO3001 evaluated the efficacy of guselkumab compared with adalimumab through Week 48 in 
the  overall  population,  and  therefore  provides  the  best  evidence  of  persistence  of  efficacy  resulting 
from continuous treatment. 
Beginning at Week 8 and continuing through Week 48, guselkumab-treated subjects maintained higher 
rates  of  all  4  PASI  responses  (PASI  100,  PASI  90,  PASI  75,  PASI  50)  compared  with  adalimumab-
treated subjects. For PASI 90 responses (Figure 13), the maximum efficacy in the guselkumab group 
and  maximum  separation  from  the  adalimumab  group  appeared  to  occur  by  Week  20  and  was 
maintained  through  Week  48.  Comparable  results  were  observed  for  IGA  0  (Figure  14).  Assessed  by 
complete psoriasis clearance (PASI 100 response and IGA 0), guselkumab demonstrated a high level of 
efficacy as evident at Week 48 with 47.4% and 50.5% of subjects in the guselkumab group achieving 
a PASI 100 response and IGA 0, respectively. 
These  results  indicate  that  high  levels  of  clinical  response  were  maintained  with  continuous 
guselkumab treatment administered q8w.

Study 3002 - maintenance of response  
Subjects  originally  randomized  to  the  guselkumab  group  who  had  achieved  a  PASI  90  response  at 
Week  28  were  rerandomized  to  either  continue  guselkumab  treatment  (maintenance  group)  or  be 
withdrawn from guselkumab treatment; ie, receive placebo (withdrawal group). A life-table estimates 
analysis was utilized in which subjects were counted as having lost a PASI 90 response from the visit 
at  which  it  was  first  lost  and  then  for  all  subsequent  visits  as  well.  Among  subjects  rerandomized  at 
Week  28,  PASI  90  response  was  significantly  better  maintained  through  Week  48  among  subjects 
continuing  to  receive  guselkumab  than  it  was  among  subjects  in  whom  guselkumab  treatment  was 
withdrawn (Figure 15). Specifically, among PASI 90 responders randomized to withdrawal group, loss 
of PASI 90 response was evident as early as 4 weeks after withdrawal of therapy (Week 28) with the

median  time  to  loss  of  PASI  90  of  15.2  weeks.  At  Week  48,  a  significantly  greater  proportion  of 
subjects  in  the  guselkumab  maintenance  group  were  PASI  90  responders  compared  with  the 
withdrawal group (88.6% vs 36.8% p<0.001).  
In addition, subjects in the placebo→guselkumab group who were PASI 90 responders at Week 28 and 
withdrawn from therapy showed a similar loss of efficacy.

Study 3002 - response to retreatment 
Study  PSO3002  also  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  re-treatment  with  guselkumab.  Twenty  subjects  who 
experienced  loss  of  therapeutic  effect  (ie,  loss  of  ≥ 50%  of  their  Week  28  PASI  improvement)  after 
withdrawal  from  therapy  were  followed  for  at  least  4  weeks  after  reinitiating  guselkumab.  Within  4 
weeks  of  re-initiation  of  therapy,  the  majority  of  subjects  (65%,  13/20)  achieved  at  least  a  PASI  50 
response. However, the number of subjects who were re-treated 8 weeks or longer prior to Week 48 
was small and thus limits the interpretation of the results for re-treatment with guselkumab. 
Study 3002 - psoriasis improvement for PASI 90 nonresponders at week 28 
Subjects  randomized  to  adalimumab  who  were  PASI  90  nonresponders  at  Week  28  initiated  the 
guselkumab  100  mg  dose  regimen  (guselkumab  100  mg  SC  at  Weeks  28  and  32,  followed  by  q8w 
thereafter)  from  Week  28  through  Week  48.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  PASI  90  response 
increased within 4 weeks of initiating guselkumab 100 mg at Week 28 and was 66.1% by Week 48. A 
similar trend was observed for IGA scores through Week 48. 
With continued treatment with guselkumab, some subjects who were PASI 90 nonresponders at Week 
28  in  both  the  placebo→guselkumab  and  guselkumab  groups  showed  improvement  in  PASI  response 
through  Week  48,  with  60.0%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo→guselkumab  and  35.8%  of  subjects  in  the 
guselkumab group achieving a PASI 90 response at Week 48.

Improvement in Regional Measures of Psoriasis 
Consistent improvements were observed in scalp psoriasis, nail psoriasis, and hand or foot psoriasis in 
the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Week  16  across  studies  PSO3001  and 
PSO3002  for  subjects  with  an  ss-IGA,  f-PGA,  and/or  hf-PGA  score  ≥ 2  at  baseline  or  with  a  NAPSI 
score  >0  at  baseline  .  In  addition,  in  both  studies,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  guselkumab 
subjects had scalp psoriasis and hand and foot psoriasis improvement compared with the adalimumab 
group  at  Week  24.  Although  guselkumab  treatment  resulted  in  substantial  improvement  of  nail 
psoriasis,  the  effects  observed  were  not  significantly  different  between  the  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab groups in either study as measured by f-PGA or NAPSI at Week 24.   
At Week 48 in study PSO3001: 
• 
A  significantly  (p=0.038)  greater  proportion  of  guselkumab  subjects  (74.7%)  achieved  an  f-
PGA score of 0 or 1 than adalimumab subjects (61.8%).  
• 
Subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  a  greater  mean  percent  improvement  in  NAPSI  score 
comparable to subjects in the adalimumab group.  
• 
Subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  significantly  greater  (p<0.001)  differences  in  ss-IGA 
scores and at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline compared with adalimumab.  
• 
Guselkumab treatment produced a significantly higher proportion of subjects with hf-PGA score 
of 0 or 1 and at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline than adalimumab (p=0.045).   
In study PSO3002, subjects who were PASI 90 responders at Week 28 and rerandomized to continue 
guselkumab  at  Week  28  showed  continued  improvement  in  f-PGA  and  NAPSI  scores  at  Week  48  and 
maintained their ss-IGA and hf-PGA scores at Week 48.

Improvement in Patient-reported Outcomes and Health-related Quality of Life Measures 
Key  patient-reported  outcomes  used  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  guselkumab  in  PSO3001  and  PSO3002 
included the PSSD and the DLQI. Additional patient-reported outcome efficacy measures used only in

cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale for 
the  assessment  of  treatment  benefit.  Two  summary  scores  are  derived:  the psoriasis  symptom  score 
and the psoriasis sign score. Summary scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher score indicates more 
severe disease.  
Across  both  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002,  and  consistent  with  the  improvement  observed  in  the 
physician-assessments  (PASI  and  IGA),  significant  improvements  in  PSSD  summary  scores  were 
observed  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Week  16  (all  p<0.001.  The 
magnitude  of  improvements  of  PSSD  scores  including  individual  symptom  or  sign  scale  scores  from 
baseline  within  treatment  groups  was  consistent  between  the  2  studies.  Significantly  better 
improvements  in  PSSD  scores  were  also  observed  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the 
adalimumab group at Week 24. Most importantly, the proportions of subjects treated with guselkumab 
that had clinically meaningful improvements (i.e. ≥ 40 points) in symptom and sign scores at Week 24 
were  significantly  higher  compared  to  subjects  treated  with  adalimumab,  as  were  the  proportions  of 
guselkumab-treated subjects free of all symptoms and signs of psoriasis (i.e. sign and symptom scores 
=0). 
At  Week  48  of  study  PSO3001,  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  a  significantly  greater 
improvement  in  PSSD  summary  scores  and  in  each  individual  PSSD  symptom  scale  and  in  each 
individual PSSD sign scale score than subjects in the adalimumab group. 
In  addition,  through  Week  48  in  study  PSO3002,  improvements  in  PSSD  scores  were  maintained 
among  subjects  who  were  rerandomized  to  guselkumab  at  Week  28,  while  PSSD  improvements 
declined among those subjects rerandomized to the placebo group and had treatment withdrawn. 
Dermatology Life Quality Index 
The  DLQI  is  a  quality  of  life  instrument  designed  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  disease  on  a  subject’s 
quality  of  life.  It  is  a  10-item  PRO  questionnaire  that,  in  addition  to  evaluating  overall  quality  of  life, 
can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily 
activities,  leisure,  work  or  school  performance,  personal  relationships,  and  treatment.  The  DLQI 
produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. A higher score indicates more severe disease 
while a score of 0 or 1 represents no impact of skin disease on health related quality of life.  
Across both studies (PSO3001 and PSO3002) significant improvements in DLQI scores were observed 
in the guselkumab group compared with the placebo group at Week 16 (all p<0.001) and numerically 
greater improvements compared with the adalimumab group at Week 24 . In particular, a significantly 
greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  groups  of  both  studies  had  a  DLQI  score  of  0  or  1 
(indicating no impact of skin disease on subjects’ health-related quality of life) compared with subjects 
in  the  placebo  group  at  Week  16,  and  adalimumab  at  Week  24  (all  p<0.001).  In  study  PSO3001,  a 
significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab group achieved a DLQI score of 0 or 1, 
compared  with  the  adalimumab  group  at  Week  48.  In  study  PSO3002,  improvements  in  DLQI  were 
maintained  through  Week  48  among  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  guselkumab  (ie,  maintenance 
group)  at  Week  28,  while  DLQI  improvements  declined  among  those  subjects  randomized  to  the 
placebo group and had treatment withdrawn.  
Other Health-related Quality of Life Measures 
In  study  PSO3002,  the  SF-36,  HADS,  and  WLQ  were  completed  by  subjects  at  the  site  and  captured 
electronically. 
• 
The  guselkumab  group  had  significant  improvements  from  baseline  in  the  SF-36  physical 
(5.462  vs  0.941,  p<0.001)  and  mental  (5.659  vs  0.568,  p<0.001)  component  summary  scores  at

Week  16  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  clinically  meaningful 
improvement of 5 or more from baseline in SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores at 
Week  16  was  significantly  greater  for  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo 
group. 
• 
At Week 16, subjects in the guselkumab group had a significantly greater mean improvement 
from  baseline  in  the  HADS  anxiety  (-1.1  vs  -0.2,  p<0.001)  and  depression  (-1.6  vs  -0.1,  p<0.001) 
scores  as  compared  with the  placebo  group.  Among  subjects  with  baseline  hospital  anxiety  score ≥ 8 
(instrument  definition  of  anxiety)  or  with  baseline  depression  score  ≥ 8  (instrument  definition  of 
depression),  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  a  hospital  anxiety  score  <8  or  depression  score  <8  at 
Week  16  were  significantly  greater  for  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo 
group.  
• 
At  Week  16,  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  significantly  greater  improvement  in  all 
scores of the WLQ compared with the placebo group: physical demand score (-7.5 vs 0.4, p<0.001); 
time  management  score  (-6.0  vs  0.1  p=0.002);  mental-interpersonal  score  (-5.3  vs  -0.7,  p=0.002); 
output demand score (-5.8 vs -2.2, p=0.026). 
Ancillary analyses of studies 3001 and 3002 - improvement in psoriasis across subpopulations 
The  consistency  of  the  co-primary  and  selected  major  secondary  endpoints  (IGA  0/1  and  PASI  90  at 
Week  16  and  Week  24,  and  IGA  0  at  Week  24)  was  examined  across  relevant  subpopulations  of 
subjects in studies PSO3001 and PSO3002. 
• 
Baseline demographics; sex, race, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline weight by quartiles, 
body mass index, and geographic location. 
• 
Baseline  disease  characteristics;  age  at  diagnosis,  psoriasis  disease  duration,  baseline  PASI,

therapies,  biologic  systemic  therapies,  either  non-biologic  or  biologic  systemic  therapies,  anti-TNFα 
agents  (etanercept,  infliximab),  IL-12/23  inhibitors  (ustekinumab,  briakinumab),  IL-17  inhibitors 
(secukinumab,  ixekizumab,  or  brodalumab),  subjects  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to,  were 
intolerant to, or had a contraindication to non-biologic systemic therapies (PUVA,  MTX, cyclosporine), 
biologic systemic therapies (etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab) or etanercept. 
Subgroup analyses (proportion differences and 95% CI) were performed based on the individual study 
(PSO3001 and PSO3002) data. To increase precision, subgroup analyses were also performed based on 
the pooled data from these 2 studies.  
In  each  individual  study,  among  all  the  subgroups  with  a  reasonable  sample  size  for  evaluation  (ie, 
sample size is ≥ 10 subjects in both groups for placebo comparisons and ≥ 20 subjects in both groups 
for adalimumab comparisons), guselkumab showed a numerically higher response than placebo (Week 
16) or adalimumab (Week 24) treatment across all demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and 
psoriasis  medication  history.  Similar  results  were  observed  for  the  pooled  data  from  PSO3001  and 
PSO3002.  While  modest  variability  of  performance  was  evident  for  some  subgroups,  particularly  for 
those with a small sample size, these results demonstrate that guselkumab was highly effective across 
all of the subpopulations analyzed. 
Impact of Body Weight 
Serum  guselkumab  concentrations  were  affected  by  body  weight.  Subjects  of  higher  body  weight  at 
baseline (>90 kg) had approximately 30% to 36% lower mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab 
Assessment report

concentrations compared with subjects of lower body weight (≤ 90 kg).  Although the impact of weight 
on PK was considered modest, several analyses were performed to examine the impact of body weight 
on PASI and IGA response rates for subjects that received the proposed guselkumab dose regimen (ie, 
100 mg at Weeks 0, 4 and q8w). In studies PSO3001 and PSO3002, subjects in the guselkumab group 
consistently achieved higher clinical responses compared with both the placebo group at Week 16 and 
the  adalimumab  group  at  Week  24  and  Week  48  across  all  weight  strata.  Clinical  responses  were 
modestly  lower  in  the  >90  kg  subgroup  compared  with  the  ≤ 90  kg  subgroup  through  Week  24, 
particularly  for  the  higher  level  of  responses  (eg,  PASI  100).  However,  differences  in  the  response 
rates  between  the  2  weight  subgroups  decreased  over  time  and  were  comparable  at  Week  48  in  the 
PSO3001 study. 
Using  the  pooled  data  from  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  at  Week  16,  subgroup  analyses  showed  that 
response  rate  treatment  effects  (guselkumab  minus  placebo)  for  IGA  0/1  were  consistent  across  all 
baseline  weight  quartiles.  Response  rates  for  IGA  0/1  at  Week  24,  using  pooled  data  from  PSO3001 
and  PSO3002,  were  slightly  lower  (approximately  5%)  in  subjects  >90  kg  than  in  those  ≤ 90  kg. 
Modeling  and  simulation  results  of  the  pooled  PSO2001,  PSO3001,  and  PSO3002  data  predicted  that 
the effect of weight on response at Week 16 and Week 28 would be modest. For example, the model-
predicted efficacy response rates of the 100 mg q8w dose regimen at Week 16 were approximately 6% 
lower  in  subjects  >90  kg  compared  with  subjects  ≥ 90  kg.  However,  the  flat  slope  of  the  simulated 
dose  response  curve  beyond  the  100  mg  dose  for  subjects  in both body  weight  categories  suggested 
that a weight-based dose adjustment would not result in a substantial change in response rates, and 
therefore is not warranted. 
Outcomes of study PSO3003 
In study PSO3003, efficacy analyses based on the number of visits (of the 4 visits between Week 28 
and Week 40) at which subjects achieved predefined high levels of IGA or PASI responses were utilized 
primarily to allow for an evaluation of the consistency of response over time. In addition, this approach 
accounts for the effects of peak and trough drug exposure variation between the 2 drugs (guselkumab 
and ustekinumab) over the 4-month dosing interval and corresponding 4 visits.  
Subjects who were ustekinumab inadequate responders (defined as having an IGA score ≥ 2 at Week 
16)  had  significantly  better  efficacy  following  the  switch  to  guselkumab  compared  to  the  group  that 
remained  on  ustekinumab.  All  primary  and  multiplicity-adjusted  major  secondary  endpoints  of  study 
PSO3003  were  met  (p≤ 0.001  for  all  comparisons).  Efficacy  analyses  demonstrated  that  the 
guselkumab group achieved clinical responses approximately twice as often as the ustekinumab group.  
In addition to analyses based on the number of visits at which subjects achieved predefined response 
levels,  differences  in  response  rates  over  time,  which  are  generally  more  intuitive  to  clinicians,  were 
also  analyzed.  Differences  in  PASI  90  response  rate  between  guselkumab  and  ustekinumab  treated 
subjects favoring guselkumab were noted as early as 4 weeks after subjects were randomized at Week 
16  (ie,  Week  20),  and  then  continued  to  increase  through  Week  40.  The  proportion  of  randomized 
subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  with  an  IGA  0/1  and  ≥ 2  grade  improvement  from  Week  16 
demonstrated a similar result.

The  guselkumab  group  also  demonstrated  a  significantly  greater  improvement  in  patient-reported 
outcomes  (DLQI  and  PSSD)  compared  with  the  ustekinumab  group.  The  mean  number  of  visits  at 
which  randomized  subjects  had  a  DLQI  score  of  0  or  1  from  Week  28  through  Week  40  was 
significantly  higher  for  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the ustekinumab  group  (1.4 
visits and 0.7 visits, respectively; p=0.002). The mean number of visits at which randomized subjects 
had a PSSD symptom score of 0 from Week 28 through Week 40 was significantly higher for subjects 
in the guselkumab group compared with the ustekinumab group (0.6 visits and 0.3 visits, respectively; 
p=0.028). 
These study results demonstrate that psoriasis subjects who had not achieved a “cleared” or “minimal” 
response on ustekinumab by Week 16 derived significant benefit from switching to guselkumab relative 
to remaining on ustekinumab.

Impact of immunogenicity on the efficacy of guselkumab 
In  the  Phase  2  study  PSO2001  and  Phase  3  studies  PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and  PSO3003,  the 
development  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  and  the  titer  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  were  not 
associated  with  a  reduction  in  the  clinical  efficacy  of  guselkumab.  However,  the  small  number  of 
antibody  positive  subjects  observed  in  these  studies  limits  a  definitive  conclusion  of  the  impact  of 
antibodies to guselkumab on clinical efficacy. 
Relevant data from studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 were also pooled and analyzed to further evaluate 
the impact of antibodies to guselkumab on the efficacy of guselkumab. Consistent with the results from 
the individual studies, the development of antibodies to guselkumab and peak titers did not appear to 
be associated with a reduction in the efficacy of guselkumab.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Cross-study  comparisons  of  efficacy  focused  on  the  results  through  Week  24  from  the  2  Phase  3 
studies  (PSO3001  and  PSO3002),  which  included  the  same  subject  eligibility  criteria,  treatment 
groups,  and  dose  regimens  were  performed.  Study  PSO3003  was  not  included  in  the  cross-study 
comparisons due to its unique study design, where randomized subjects were those who inadequately 
responded to ustekinumab. 
The  comparisons  focused  on  evaluating  consistency  in  guselkumab  efficacy  across  the  overall 
population for: 
•  The  magnitude  of  treatment  effect  versus  placebo  through  Week  16  or  adalimumab  through 
Week 24 
•  Time to onset of efficacy and response over time through Week 24 
•  The above comparisons focused on the measurements common to both studies. 
Additionally, the cross-study comparisons also evaluated the consistency in the association of efficacy 
versus serum guselkumab concentration and efficacy versus antibodies to guselkumab. 
Analyses were performed on the pooled data for the same subpopulations that were evaluated in the 
individual studies for the co-primary endpoints at Week 16, and selected major secondary endpoints at 
Week  24.  For  each  of  the  subpopulations,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  clinical  response  is 
presented  for  the  guselkumab  and  placebo  groups  (at  Week  16)  and  for  the  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab  groups  (at  Week  24).  Differences  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  clinical 
response, and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) (provided when the number of subjects was 
at  least  10  in  each  treatment  group)  for  the  differences  were  calculated  adjusted  by  study  using 
Mantel-Haenszel  (MH)  weights.  Formal  comparisons  were  to  be  performed  for  subpopulations  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 100/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects  who  had  a  contraindication  to,  had  an  inadequate  response  to,  or  were  intolerant  to  any  of 
the  3  nonbiologic  systemic  therapies  (PUVA,  methotrexate  [MTX],  or  cyclosporine),  or  for  the 
subpopulations  of  subjects  who  had  a  contraindication  to,  had  an  inadequate  response  to,  or  were 
intolerant to etanercept. Nominal p values were provided based on the CMH Chi-square test or Fisher 
exact text and were only provided if the number of subjects was at least 10 in each treatment group. 
Data from studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 were also pooled to assess the association between efficacy 
and  antibody  to  guselkumab  status  (see  details  above,  at  “ancillary  analyses”).  Specifically,  the 
proportions of subjects who achieved clinical responses (listed below) at Week 28 were evaluated with 
respect to the status of antibody to guselkumab (ie, positive or negative)  through Week 48. 
Psoriasis Improvement  
The  onset  of  clinical  efficacy  as  measured  by  achieving  IGA  0/1  and  a  PASI  90  response  occurred  as 
early  as  Week  2  in  both  studies  (PSO3001  and  PSO3002).  By  Week  8  in  both  studies,  guselkumab 
treatment  responses  separated  from  those  of  adalimumab.  The  response  separation  between 
guselkumab and adalimumab continued to increase and reached a maximum around Week 16 and 20 
for  IGA 0/1  and  PASI  90  response,  respectively,  and  was  maintained  through  the  common  Week  24 
period.

Figure 19 - PASI 90 Response Over Time (PSO3001 and PSO3002) 
In  the  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  studies,  the  response  rate  as  measured  by  IGA  and  PASI  scores  was 
consistent  for  each  treatment  group,  and  hence,  the  magnitude  of  treatment  differences  in  the 
response  rates  between  treatment  groups  was  consistent  between  the  2  studies  for  guselkumab 
compared with placebo at Week 16, and compared with adalimumab at Week 16 and Week 24  
Regional Psoriasis Improvement  
Consistent improvements were observed across studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 in scalp psoriasis, nail 
psoriasis,  and  hand  or  foot  psoriasis  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at 
Week  16.    In  addition,  in  both  studies,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  guselkumab  subjects  had 
scalp psoriasis and hand and foot psoriasis improvement compared with the adalimumab group at both 
Week  16  and  Week  24.  Improvement  in  nail  psoriasis  was  not  significantly  different  between  the 
guselkumab and adalimumab groups in either study as measured by f-PGA or NAPSI at Week 24.   
Improvement in Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Across  both  studies  (PSO3001  and  PSO3002)  and  consistent  with  the  improvement  observed  in  the 
physician-assessments (PASI and IGA), significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes of DLQI 
and  PSSD  were  observed  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  Significantly 
better  improvements  in  patient-reported  outcomes  of  DLQI  and  PSSD  were  also  observed  in  the 
guselkumab group compared with the adalimumab group at Week 24. The magnitude of improvements 
of these patient-reported outcomes from baseline within treatment groups was consistent between the 
2 studies, and treatment differences were also consistent between the 2 studies.  
Persistence of Efficacy with Continuous Therapy

Information  on  the  persistence  of  efficacy  during  guselkumab  treatment  is  available  from  both 
PSO3001  and  PSO3002.  The  study  PSO3001  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  guselkumab  compared  with 
adalimumab  through  Week  48  in  the  overall  population,  and  therefore  provides  the  best  evidence  of 
persistence  of  efficacy  resulting  from  continuous  treatment.  Additional  information on  the  persistence 
of  efficacy  is  also  available  from  analyses  of  efficacy  data  from  the  randomized  withdrawal portion of 
study  PSO3002,  however,  this  portion  of  study  PSO3002  was  intended  to  assess  the  benefit  of 
maintenance  therapy  versus  withdrawal  and  therefore  focused  on  subjects  who  were  PASI  90 
responders at Week 28.  
The  PSO3001  study  results  demonstrated  that  improvement  in  psoriasis,  regional  psoriasis,  and 
patient-reported  outcomes  were  all  maintained  through  Week  48  with  guselkumab  treatment.  For 
example, the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 100 response was 37.4% at Week 16, reached a 
maximum efficacy response of 49.8% by Week 32 and was maintained at Week 48 (47.4%). PASI 
90 response rate was 76.3% with guselkumab continued treatment at week 48. 
In the study PSO3002, persistence of efficacy was observed in PASI 90 responders who continued q8w 
guselkumab  maintenance  therapy  through  Week  48  relative  to  subjects  in  whom  guselkumab  was 
withdrawn. By life-table estimates, maintenance therapy with guselkumab yielded a significantly higher 
cumulative  PASI  90  response  rate  compared  with  withdrawal  of  therapy  through  Week  48.  Higher 
response rates were observed with maintenance therapy relative to withdrawal of therapy by a variety 
of  measures  including  different  PASI  thresholds  (including  PASI  100  responses:  58%  or  PASI  90 
responses:  88.6%)  or  continuous  measures  of  disease  (eg,  percentage  of  PASI  improvement  from 
baseline).  Through  Week  48,  other  efficacy  measures,  including  measures  of  nail  psoriasis,  scalp 
psoriasis  and  hand  and  foot  psoriasis  also  continued  to  show  high  response  rates,  and  sustained 
improvements in patient-reported outcomes were also observed in the maintenance group.  
In summary, these results suggest high levels of clinical response and patient-reported outcome 
response were maintained with continuous guselkumab treatment administered every 8 weeks. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Supportive studies 
Study CNTO1959PSO1001 
Study  PSO1001  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  ascending  dose  study  of 
guselkumab  following  a  single  intravenous  (IV)  or  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  in  healthy 
subjects (Part 1) and in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis (Part 2).  
In Part 2, following a single SC administration of 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg guselkumab to subjects with 
psoriasis:

•  The median percent improvement from baseline in PASI increased across all guselkumab dose 
groups,  with  the  maximum  improvement  from  baseline  observed  at  Week  12  for  the  30  mg 
(86.60%), 100 mg (75.90%), and 300 mg (98.20%) dose groups and at Week 16 for the 10 
mg (76.90%) group  
•  PGA responses were generally consistent with results of the PASI analysis. 
Study CNTO1959PSO1002 
Study  PSO1002  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  ascending  single  dose  study  of 
guselkumab  in  Japanese  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis.  The  clinical  efficacy 
observed in this study was consistent with Part 2 of study PSO1001.  
•  The maximum clinical response was observed at Week 16 in all guselkumab dose groups. The 
median percent improvement from baseline in PASI score at Week 16 in the 10, 30, 100, and 
300  mg  dose  groups  (5  subjects  each)  was  63.16%,  90.95%,  86.67%  and  90.65%, 
respectively, compared to -5.33% in the placebo group (1 subject).  
PGA responses were generally consistent with the results of the PASI analysis. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy  of  guselkumab  is  substantiated  by  a  comprehensive  data  package  including  a  phase  2  dose-
ranging  study  (PSO2001)  and  three  phase  3  studies  (PSO3001,  PSO3002  and  PSO3003)  and  some 
data from phase 1 studies in psoriasis.  
Development  was  in  line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products 
Indicated  for  the  Treatment  of  Psoriasis  (CHMP/EWP/2454/02  corr,  effective  June  2005)  (further 
referred  as  EMA  psoriasis  guideline).  All  clinical  studies  were  GCP-compliant  and  the  design  of  the 
studies was considered adequate.  
Adult subjects were enrolled with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined by a PASI≥ 12, PGA (or 
IGA)≥ 3,  and  BSA  involvement  of  at  least  10%,  who  were  candidates  for  systemic  or  phototherapy. 
Enrolment criteria were well in accordance with the EMA psoriasis guideline requirements. The patient 
population of the different studies has been adequately selected. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  IGA  score  0/1  and  PASI  90  response  in  studies  PSO3001  and  3002. 
Choosing the composite endpoint of a global psoriasis assessment tool and PASI response is very well 
in  accordance  with  the  psoriasis  guideline  requirements.  Results  obtained  with  other  IL-inhibitors 
justify  the  PASI  100/PASI  90  response  instead  of  lowered  response  rates,  however,  for  comparative 
purposes, PASI 50 and PASI 75 are also useful parameters. The 5-point IGA 0/1 scores correspond to 
PASI 90 rather than to PASI 75 response: an improvement of >PASI 90% response and IGA 0/1 both 
reflect clear or almost clear from psoriatic lesions. The 5-point IGA is a modified version of the 6-point 
PGA.  The  5-point  IGA  is  considered  a  valid  measure  of  psoriasis  disease  severity.  In  line  with  one  of 
the  composite  primary  endpoints  in  the  other  phase  3  studies,  non-response  to  ustekinumab  was 
defined  as  having  IGA>=  2  in  study  PSO3003.  The  primary  endpoint  and  several  of  the  major 
secondary  endpoints  in  study  PSO3003  were  different  from  the  previous  phase  3  studies  as  it 
compared the mean number of visits (out of 4 visits between Week 28 and Week 40) with predefined 
clinical  responses  (primary  endpoint  was  number  of  visits  achieved  an  IGA0-1  with  at  least  2  grade 
Assessment report

improvement)  between  the  guselkumab  and  ustekinumab  treatment  groups.  This  approach  was 
utilized primarily to allow for an evaluation of the consistency of response over time and is considered 
adequate  by  CHMP.  However  it  did  not  allow  pooling  of  data  with  the  preceding  studies  and  IGA  0-1 
and PASI 90 responses at each visit would have provided this information. 
PSSD  is  a  patient-reported  outcome  measure  developed  by  the  Applicant.    This  was  aimed  to  detect 
signs  and  symptoms  experienced  by  a  patient  on  a  daily  basis.  The  PSSD  has  demonstrated  strong 
psychometric  properties  when  validated  in  a  moderate  to  severe  plague  psoriasis  population.  A  ≥40-
point  change  from  baseline  in  PSSD  symptom  score  and  sign  score,  and  ≥3  to  5  point  change  in 
individual PSSD item scale scores were defined as cut-offs for clinical response or clinically meaningful 
change. The PSSD has 2 versions: a daily diary with a 24-hour recall period and a weekly diary with a 
7-day  recall  period.  Both  versions  were  validated,  and  the  validation  study  showed  consistent  results 
between  the  2  versions.  The  daily  diary  was  administered  in  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  and  the 
weekly  diary  was  administered  in  study  PSO3003.  During  validation  high  internal  consistency-  and 
test-retest-reliability  were  demonstrated.  Severity  categories  by  PASI  or  PGA  were  well  followed  by 
this new instrument, however, sample sizes were sometimes low to draw a firm statistical conclusion. 
The  Applicant  elaborated  how  responder  definition  (clinically  meaningful  changes)  in  PSSD-7d 
symptom  and  signs  summary  score  was  estimated.  It  was  done  by  using  both  an  anchor-  and 
distribution-based  approach  a  change  of  -2  in  IGA  score  and  a  PASI  improvement  of  ≥ 75  to  <90% 
were  considered  as  reasonable  anchors  to  establish  response  criteria  for  the  PSSD-7d  (Langley  et  al. 
2015; Robinson et al. 2012). Based on the validation report on PSSD, the proposed responder criteria 
are  considered  acceptable.  PSSD  was  translated  into  several  languages,  too.  Based  on  the  evidence 
submitted  in  validation  report  content  validity  and  other  measurement  properties  can  be  comparable 
between the original and translated instrument(s).  
The Applicant did not seek advice from the EMA regarding the validation of the Psoriasis Symptom and 
Sign Diary however the Applicant did interact with the FDA and followed for the PSSD development and 
validation process the FDA’s Guidance for Industry Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in 
Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims (December 2009), and was found to be a 
useful reported outcome tool. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
PSO2001: dose-ranging 
A  total  of  293  subjects  were  randomized  in  study  PSO2001.  The  overall  completion  rate  was  high 
(>90%) and discontinuation rates were comparable across arms.  
A dose-response relationship was observed in skin-related endpoints such as  PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 
90 responder rates, PGA of cleared, PASI score of 0, PGA of cleared or minimal or mild (score 0/1 /2) 
and quality of life index (DLQI) at week 16. Overall, better results were obtained for the 100 mg s.c. 
q8w.  Dose  regimen  ≥  50  mg  q12w  resulted  in  better  clinical  response  than  adalimumab  and  all 
patients  in  active  arms  reached  higher  response  than  those  in  placebo.    Such  a  firm  dose-response 
relationship was not apparent at week 40 and 52, however, the 50 mg q12w, 100 mg q8w and 200 mg 
q12w dose groups performed significantly better than adalimumab and lower guselkumab dose groups. 
Patients who were switched from placebo to 100 mg q8w guselkumab at week 16 achieved the same 
magnitude  of  response  than  those  who  were  on  higher  guselkumab  doses  within  16  weeks  of 
guselkumab treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 105/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based  on  the  outcomes  of  the  phase  2  dose-ranging  study  it  was  concluded  that  100  mg  q8w  dose 
regimen showed overall the best efficacy results which were also the most clinically relevant. Thus, this 
posology  was  carried  forward  in  phase  3  studies.  To  accelerate the  onset  of  effect,  a  loading  dose of 
100 mg guselkumab was also given at Week 4 prior to 100 mg q8w maintenance dosing in the Phase 3 
program.  
The  need  of  an  induction  dose  was  thoroughly  discussed.  The  decision  on  starting  with  an  induction 
dose was based on PK data and the aim was to increase exposure rapidly. To evaluate whether rapid 
increase  in  exposure  translate  into  clinical  effect,  the  Applicant  made  a  cross-study  comparison  of 
PASI90 response rates. Response rates of 100 mg q8w/PSO2001 were plotted against response rates 
of induction dose+100 mg q8w/PSO3001. According to the Applicant, an improvement during the first 
20 weeks and a shortening of the time needed to reach the plateau of effect by at least 4 weeks was 
evident that justify the benefit from the induction dose. 
The phase 3 results with the applied dosing regimen demonstrated robust efficacy and safety data, and 
therefore are acceptable. 
When comparing q8w and q12w dosing intervals, a loss of efficacy at the end of dosing interval could 
be  observed  for  the  q12w  dosing  but  not  for  the  q8w  dosing  group.  However,  in  the  phase  3  study 
(withdrawal phase of study 3002), the proportion of subjects with a PASI 90 response began to decline 
only  12  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  guselkumab.  Further  justification  was  required  by  CHMP  on  the 
q8w  dosing.  In  study  PSO3002,  PASI  90  response  rate  declined  12  weeks  after  cessation  of  therapy. 
This  may  suggest  that  longer  dosing  intervals  could  have  been  tested  in  a  larger  population.  It  was 
considered by the CHMP that the phase 3 studies were performed with the q8w dose regimen and data 
robustly  support  high  efficacy  of  guselkumab  (with  the  applied  regimen),  further  analysis  is  not 
required for benefit-risk assessment. 
In  study  PSO3002/randomised-withdrawal  phase,  the  placebo  groups  still  had  a  high%  of  patients 
maintaining  PASI  50  and  75  responses.  The  guselkumab  maintenance  dosage  of  100  mg  q8w  was 
proposed because it provides optimal efficacy for the majority of patients. The randomized withdrawal 
results from study PSO3002 demonstrate consistently that a loss of efficacy occurs in some subjects at 
Week  32,  which  was  the  first  timepoint  at  which  efficacy  was  assessed  following  withdrawal  of 
guselkumab.  Although  a  median  time  to  loss  of  PASI  90  response  of  15.2  weeks  for  subjects  in  the 
withdrawal group likely means that there are some subjects that could maintain efficacy with a lower 
dosage  (longer  dose  interval  or  lower  dose),  efforts  to  date  to  prospectively  identify  a  subgroup  of 
subjects  (such  as  demography  or  psoriasis  severity)  who  could  maintain  efficacy  with  lower  dosage 
have  not  been  successful.  Thus,  the  weight  of  all  available  evidence,  including  a  favorable  safety 
profile,  is  consistent  with  the  conclusion  that  the  recommended  dose  regimen  of  100  mg  q8w 
represents the best choice for most patients. 
Phase 3 studies 
The  Phase  3  clinical  development  program  for  guselkumab  included  2,700  adult  subjects  (837  in 
PSO3001,  992  in  PSO3002,  and  871  in  PSO3003).  Study  population  was  mainly  in  line  with  general 
psoriasis population in terms of demographics, disease characteristics and medication history and was 
considered to be adequate. In study 3001, guselkumab treatment arm included smaller proportion of 
patients  with  intolerance  to/contraindication  or  inadequate  response  to  at  least  one  biologic  therapy 
(etanercept,  ustekinumab,  infliximab).  This  may  raise  a  question  whether  patients  enrolled  into 
guselkumab arm were less treatment resistant, which might influence results. Looking at the totality of 
data  this  is,  however,  very  unlikely.  Such  an  imbalance  was  not  observed  in  study  PSO3002  and  the 
results from these two studies (PSO3001 and PSO3002) are highly consistent. The proportion of TNFi 
Assessment report

inadequate  responders  was  low  in  studies  PSO3001  and  3002  (c.a.2%).  In  study  3001,  there  was  a 
slight  imbalance  in  proportions  across  arms  (placebo,  guselkumab,  adalimumab,  respectively):  10 
(5.7%)  7  (2.1%)  5  (1.5%).  However,  the  sample  sizes  are  generally  low  and  results  were  unlikely 
biased  by  this  imbalance.  Regarding  non-biologic  systemic  medications,  32%  of  subjects  were 
inadequate responders and distribution across arms was generally similar. 
The  overall  completion  rates  were  high  in  all  three  studies  (around  90%  at  week  48  in  studies  3001 
and  3002).  Withdrawals  due  to  non-compliance  with  study  drug  were  low  and  comparable  across 
active  treatment  arms.  During  the  first  16  weeks,  discontinuation  rate  was  the  lowest  in  the 
guselkumab-arm and the highest in the placebo arm.  Regarding the reasons of withdrawals, adverse 
events occurred more frequently in the active arms than in the placebo, while lack of efficacy was the 
lowest  among  patients  treated  with  guselkumab.  In  study  PSO3003,  the  number  and  rate  of 
discontinuers who stopped treatment due to lack of efficacy were higher in ustekinumab group than in 
guselkumab group.  
Compliance  was  ensured  by  utilising  electronic  tablet  device  and  close  site  monitoring.  The  Overall 
compliance rates were high. 
In  the  phase  3  studies,  all  protocol  amendments  occurred  before  database  lock.  Protocol  violations 
discussed by the Applicant in the CSRs could not influence the integrity of studies.  
Restriction of concomitant psoriasis treatments through only Week 48 was an oversight in the original 
version  of  the  PSO3002  study  protocol.  The  second  amendment  of  study  PSO3002  was  issued  on  25 
June  2015  to  restrict  the  use  of  concomitant  medications  for  psoriasis  through  Week  76  instead  of 
through  Week  48.  The  restrictions  were  extended  through  Week  76  in  order  to  not  confound  the 
efficacy  data  during  the  randomized  withdrawal  portion  of  the  study.  At  the  time  of  the  protocol 
amendment,  no  subjects  had  passed  the  Week  48  visit,  which  occurred  on  26  October  2015. 
Therefore, this restricted use of psoriasis concomitant medications should not have had any impact on 
the study results ITT principles were followed in all three studies. 
Outcomes, Studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 
The composite primary endpoints of IGA 0/1 and PASI 90 response rate were achieved by significantly 
higher  proportion  of  subjects  with  guselkumab  than  those  with  placebo  in  studies  PSO3001  and 
PSO3002  at  weeks  16  and  24.  These  results  were  confirmed  by  several  sensitivity  analyses  and  per-
protocol analysis, too. Adalimumab performed significantly better than placebo.  
Secondary  endpoints  of  study  3001  indicate  a  robust  improvement  of  psoriasis  treated  with 
guselkumab:  44%,  80%  and  90%  of  patients  were  PASI  100,  90  and  75  responders  at  week  24. 
52.6%  of  subjects  were  totally  cleared  as  measured  by  IGA  at  week  24.  All  results  were  almost  the 
same at week 16. In study 3002 highly similar results were obtained at week 24: PASI 100 response: 
44%  or  PASI  90  response:  75%.  Guselkumab  was  superior  to  placebo  and  adalimumab  in  general 
psoriasis measures (IGA and PASI). Placebo and guselkumab response curves separated from week 2 
and adalimumab and guselkumab arms separated from week 8. Clinical response was maintained up to 
week  48.  At  week  16  placebo  patients  were  switched  to  guselkumab  and  these  patients  showed  the 
same improvement within 8 weeks (PASI responder rates).  
Physician’s  assessed  measures  of  regional  psoriasis  in  those  who  had  substantial  regional 
manifestations  of  psoriasis  (fingernail-f-PGA,  nail-NAPSI,  hand-feet-  hf-PGA,  scalp-ss-IGA)  improved 
significantly more in guselkumab patients than in those subjects who received placebo. A significantly 
higher proportion of guselkumab subjects had scalp psoriasis and hand and foot psoriasis improvement 
compared with the adalimumab group at both weeks 16 and 24. Improvement in nail psoriasis was not

significantly different between the guselkumab and adalimumab groups in either study as measured by 
f-PGA or NAPSI. 
All  patient-reported  outcomes  improved  better  in  guselkumab  arm  than  placebo  until  week  16  and 
results  were  significantly  better  in  guselkumab  than  adalimumab  groups.  Baseline  PSSD  scores 
(defined  as  the  average  score  of  at  least  4  days  out  of  the  7  days  prior  to  the  Week  0  visit)  were 
missing in 18-22% of subjects in these studies due to initial technical issues with the electronic diary 
device. These subjects were excluded from PSSD analysis. The Applicant elaborated that key baseline 
disease characteristics were similar in subjects with PSSD scores and subjects without PSSD scores. In 
addition, there were no meaningful differences in clinical response as assessed by PASI, IGA, and DLQI 
at Week 16, Week 24, and Week 48 between subjects with baseline PSSD scores and without baseline 
PSSD scores. In Study PSO3002, quality of life (DLQI and SF-36) measures indicate that guselkumab 
patients experienced improvement in their quality of life while placebo-patients did not (improvement 
in  scores  was  negligible).  Anxiety,  depression  and  work  limitation  in  terms  of  physical  and  mental 
demand  and  performance,  decreased  significantly  more  with  guselkumab  than  placebo  as  rated  by 
patients. 
At the end of the randomised-withdrawal period of study PSO3002, a significantly greater proportion of 
subjects  in  the  guselkumab  maintenance  group  were  PASI  90  responders  compared  with  the 
withdrawal group. Patients randomised to placebo lost efficacy within 15 weeks (median). 
As  lower  or  less  frequent  drug  administration  to  patients  whom  achieved  an  acceptable  clinical 
response  was  not  studied  it  is  currently  unclear  whether  patients  could  maintain  their  response  on 
lower  doses,  less  frequent  administration  or  indeed  have  a  short  break  from  treatment,  however 
antibody responses would also need to be considered. 
Loss of response was apparent from 12 weeks after the last dose of guselkumab and 9 weeks after the 
last dose of adalimumab. This is not fully in line with the results obtained in the dose-ranging phase 2 
study (see above).  
Return  closer  to  baseline  levels  of  serum  biomarker  S100A12  following  the  last  guselkumab  dose  at 
Week  40,  was  mischaracterized  as  a  “rebound”  effect.  Measured  concentrations  of  this  marker  are 
neither indicative nor connected to a clinical psoriasis rebound. 
In line with recommendations, relapse was defined as loss of at least 50% of PASI improvement from 
baseline  in  patients  who  achieved  a  clinically  meaningful  response  and  for  rebound  an  event  of  new 
erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis, worsening of PASI by 25% or greater from baseline.  
Relapse  was  evaluated  in  study  PSO3002.  Only  16  (9%)  subjects  had  relapse  during  the  withdrawal 
phase.  By  the  fourth  week  of  re-treatment,  69%  of  re-treated  subjects  regained  PASI50  response. 
Only  one  subject  experienced  rebound  of  symptoms.  Erythrodermic  or  pustular  psoriasis  was  not 
observed. Data suggest that rebound following withdrawal of guselkumab-treatment will be extremely 
rare.  
During  maintenance  of  guselkumab  treatment,  no  apparent  signs  of  intolerance  could  be  observed 
through week 48. 
Those who lost clinical response were re-treated with guselkumab in study PSO3002. Due to the small 
number  of  evaluable  patients  and  the  short  duration  of  the  re-treatment  period  at  week  48,  no  firm 
conclusion  can  be  drawn  regarding  a  possible  decrease/maintenance  of  effect  after  re-initiation  of 
guselkumab. Two-thirds of adalimumab nonresponders became PASI 90 responder by week 48 (these 
adalimumab  nonresponders  started  guselkumab  at  week  28).  Patients  treated  with  guselkumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017

achieved  significantly  higher  improvement  in  all  patient  reported  outcome  measures  than  placebo-
patients and attained better results than adalimumab-patients.  
Outcomes, Study PSO3003 
Enrolled  patients  received  ustekinumab  for  16  weeks.  PASI  response  rates  were  similar  to  previous 
Stelara studies (PASI 75 response c.a 70-74%, PASI 90 response c.a. 50%). Inadequate responders to 
ustekinumab (IGA >=2) were randomised to receive double-blind guselkumab or ustekinumab through 
week  40  which  was  the  first  database  lock  point  for  this  study.    Guselkumab-patients  demonstrated 
significantly  better  response  than  those  who  remained  on  ustekinumab  as  measured  by  the  primary 
endpoint of the number of visits at which subjects achieved an IGA response of cleared (0) or minimal 
(1) and at least a 2-grade improvement. The results from the primary analysis were confirmed by all 
sensitivity  and  per-protocol  analyses.  The  magnitude  of  effect  was  highly  similar  in  ustekinumab-
inadequate  responders  (IR)  and  in  adalimumab  IRs  in  Study  PSO3002:  PASI  90  response  rates  were 
achieved with guselkumab treatment by 60% of adalimumab-IRs and also by ustekinumab IRs. 
All  secondary  endpoints  supported  the  primary  one.  Significantly  higher  proportions  of  patients 
achieved  IGA  or  PASI  response  rates  (at  various  thresholds)  with  guselkumab  than  ustekinumab. 
Response curves separated from as early as week 4 of randomised treatment. Patients who continued 
on  open-label  ustekinumab  improved  slightly  from  Week  16  through  Week  28,  and  then  were 
maintained through Week 40, as measured by PASI  response rates and IGA score 0. In contrast, the 
IGA  score  of  cleared  (0)  or  minimal  (1)  slightly  decreased  from  week  16  through  week  40  for  these 
subjects.  Similar  figures  could  be  observed  for  subjects  randomised  to  ustekinumab-treatment,  from 
week 32 to week 40 (i.e., IGA 0/1 decreased slightly). Taking into consideration the available data it is 
considered  that  a  slight  decrease  in  open-label  ustekinumab  efficacy  in  study  PSO3003  most  likely 
represents  variability  rather  than  a  real  decrease.  Regarding  decrease  in  efficacy  in  subjects 
randomised  to  ustekinumab,  this  can  be  attributed  to  the  trough  timepoint  (at  the  end  of  q12w 
dosing). Similar phenomenon was previously described by Leonardi et al. in 2008.  
During the randomised period, patient-reported signs and symptoms of psoriasis (PSSD) and quality of 
life-results (DLQI) supported the outcomes in psoriasis improvement measures. 
Although  the  mechanistic  background  of  superior  efficacy  of  guselkumab  to  ustekinumab  is  not  fully 
clear,  the  Applicant  explained  that  preclinical  data  suggest  that  anti-p40  mAbs  may  be  counter-
productive in psoriasis disease relief. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 protein subunit that is present in 
both IL-12 and 23; therefore it blocks both IL-12 and 23-signalling. Guselkumab is more selective: it 
inhibits only IL-23-signalling by binding to the p19 subunit of IL-23.  
The  proposal  to  discontinue  treatment  in  patients  who  have  shown  no  response  after  16  weeks  was 
discussed. In study PSO3001, the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 100 response was 37.4% at 
Week  16,  reached  a  maximum  efficacy  response  of  49.8% by  Week  32  and  was  maintained  at  Week 
48  (47.4%).  In  study  PSO3003,  among  ustekinumab  non-responders,  some  additional  improvement 
could be observed in IGA 0/1 response, and even more apparently in PASI 90 response even after 16 
weeks of treatment. These data may suggest that further improvement can be expected beyond week 
16  and  further  clarifications  were  required  from  the  applicant.  The  Applicant  considered  PASI50 
response rates as the best surrogate for “no response” and explained that PASI50 responses plateaued 
at week 16 (5% of subjects in studies PSO3001 and 3002). This approach is considered appropriate by 
CHMP.

Guselkumab  performed  significantly  better  than  placebo  and  in  general,  was  also  better  than 
adalimumab regardless of baseline demographic, geographic and disease characteristics.  
No rescue therapy for psoriasis was allowed through Week 48 in the Phase 3 studies , however there 
were  some  patients  whom  received  steroids  for  concomitant  illness  (i.e.  not  due  to  psoriasis  or 
psoriatric  arthritis).  The  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  for  treatment  of  psoriasis  was  not  allowed 
throughout the duration of the Phase 3 studies. The protocols allowed systemic or topical corticosteroid 
use  for  indications  other  than  psoriasis,  essentially  only  for  AEs,  but  only  in  situations  where  there 
were  no  adequate  alternatives.  Additionally,  the  protocols  stipulated  that  corticosteroids  should  be 
used on a short-term basis, preferably for ≤2 weeks and that longer-term use of corticosteroids may 
require discontinuation of study drug. 
Overall,  the  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  was  low  in  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002.  In  study 
PSO3001, 
through  Week  48,  14 
subjects 
(6 
[1.8%]  guselkumab-treated,  3 
[1.7%] 
placebo→guselkumab-treated,  and  5  [1.5%]  adalimumab-treated)  received  systemic  corticosteroids 
(intravenous  or  oral)  for  indications  other  than  psoriasis  or  psoriatic  arthritis.  In  study  PSO3002, 
through Week 48, 16 subjects (8 [1.6%] guselkumab-treated, 4 [1.6%] placebo→guselkumab-treated, 
and  4  [1.6%]  adalimumab-treated)  received  systemic  corticosteroids  (intravenous  or  oral)  for 
indications other than psoriasis or PsA. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the co-primary and the major secondary PASI and IGA-related 
endpoints at Week 24 comparing guselkumab vs adalimumab. In addition, sensitivity analyses in which 
nonresponder  status  was  assigned  to  all  subjects  who  received  intralesional,  topical,  or  systemic 
corticosteroids  prior  to  Week  16  for  any  reason,  demonstrated  consistent  results  with  the  primary 
analysis. 
Clinical response to guselkumab were modestly lower in the >90 kg subgroup compared with the ≤90 
kg  subgroup  in  Studies  PSO3001  and  3002.  The  differences  in  the  response  rates  between  the  2 
weight subgroups (with a cut-off at 90 kg) seen at week 24 decreased over time and were eventually 
comparable at Week 48 in the PSO3001 study. It was considered that efficacy superior to placebo was 
consistently  demonstrated  across  studies  and  irrespective  of  subgroups  by  body  weight  and 
consistently across quartiles by steady-state trough concentrations. Efficacy was almost at the plateau 
of  the  exposure-response  curve.  Efficacy  responses  were  high  even  in  those  who  had  steady-state 
trough  serum  guselkumab  concentrations  <0.67  μg/mL  at  Week  28  (25%  of  subjects).  In  study 
PSO3001,  response  rates  were  modestly  to  slightly  lower  in  the  heavier  than  90  kg  subgroup  before 
Week  24,  but  comparable  at  Weeks  24  through  Week  48.  This  was  also  the  case  in  study  PSO3002. 
The  differences  in  response  rates  between  weight  subgroups  narrowed  with  increasing  duration  of 
treatment. Analysis of pooled data showed that the placebo response rates were also lower for heavier 
subjects (>90 kg) compared with lighter subjects (≤ 90 kg). It was hypothesised that intrinsic factors 
unrelated  to  guselkumab  exposure  may  have  influenced  the  response  rates  observed  for  the  two 
weight strata, however it is agreed that weight dose adjustment is not required. 
Unlike the other two phase 3 studies, study PSO3003 was stratified by weight with a cut-off at 100 kg. 
In  this  study,  better  efficacy  for  guselkumab  to  ustekinumab  in  IRs  was  demonstrated  consistently 
across body weight subgroups (below 100 kg or above 100kg). 
Significant  treatment  by  region  interaction  was  found  at  some  endpoints  for  Study  3001,  due  to  the 
larger  treatment  difference  in  efficacy  observed  between  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  for  North 
American subjects. The Applicant explained the larger treatment differences with the lower efficacy of 
adalimumab  within  this  subpopulation  relative  to  the  non-North  American  subjects.  No  significant 
Assessment report

treatment  by  region  interaction  was  found  for  PSO3002.  This  is  considered  only  a  chance  finding 
without any clinically meaningful relevance. 
Guselkumab was significantly more effective than placebo or adalimumab regardless of prior psoriasis 
therapy,  too.  The  magnitude  of  effect  was  similar  in  subjects  previously  exposed  to  biologic  therapy 
and  in  those  who  were  biologic-naïve.  Response  rates  and  treatment  effects  in  the  non-biologic  IRs 
were similar to the overall population, for pooled studies. The low number of biologic IRs did not allow 
robust conclusion on efficacy in these patients. 
Supportive  data  to  efficacy  were  collected  in  phase  1  psoriasis  studies  with  guselkumab,  clinical 
response  (percent  improvement  in  PASI  score  and  PGA  response)  were  high  with  guselkumab,  dose-
response could be observed and results were consistent. 
The  overall  incidence  of  antibody  forming  to  guselkumab  after  exposure  to  guselkumab  was  5.5% 
(n=96),  titers  were  generally  low.  Seven  (7.3%)  of  96  subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to 
guselkumab  from  the  Phase  2  and  3  psoriasis  studies  had  neutralisation  antibodies.  The  overall 
incidence  of  neutralizing  antibodies  to  guselkumab  in  subjects  who  received  guselkumab  and  had 
samples  that  were  evaluable  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  was  0.4%  (7/1,730  subjects)  (see  safety 
assessment).  Antibody  development  to  guselkumab  did  not  influenced  efficacy  as  measured  by  IGA 
and  PASI  responses  at  various  thresholds.  However,  the  small  sample  size  in  these  studies  limits  a 
definitive  conclusion  of  the  impact  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  on  clinical  efficacy.  It  was  however 
unclear  whether  prolonged  or  intermittent  therapy  could  lead  to  increased  antibody  formation  which 
could affect safety or efficacy in the longer term. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Guselkumab demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in all phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies. The 
dose carried forward to phase 3 studies is considered generally justified. The magnitude of effect is 
highly clinically relevant; at week 24 40-45% of subjects were totally cleared from psoriasis. 
Superiority to an appropriate therapy, a TNF-i adalimumab was also demonstrated. Better efficacy 
compared to ustekinumab, an IL12-23-inhibitor was also demonstrated in documented ustekinumab 
inadequate responders. The efficacy of guselkumab was consistent across studies and irrespective of 
demographic, disease or geographic characteristics or previous psoriasis therapies applied. Primary 
endpoints were supported by all secondary and other endpoints. From a clinical efficacy perspective, 
the proposed indication for the treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis requiring systemic therapy 
can be granted. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety  data  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  from  two  of  the  global  Phase  3 
studies  (PSO3001  and  PSO3002)  were  pooled,  and  serve  as  the  primary  safety  analysis  set  for  the 
integrated  summary  analyses  of  safety.  The  appropriateness  of  pooling  data  from  studies  PSO3001 
and PSO3002 is supported by their shared similarities in study design. 
Safety  data  from  the  global  Phase  3  study  PSO3003  and  the  completed  Phase  2  study  PSO2001  in 
plaque psoriasis were not pooled with data from studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 due to the differences 
in  dose  regimens  (PSO2001)  and  randomized  study  populations  (PSO3003).  Safety  data  from  the 
Assessment report

Phase 1 core psoriasis studies, PSO1001 and PSO1002, were not included in the pooled analyses due 
to the small numbers of subjects and treatment with only a single dose over a wide dose range. 
Analyses of adjudicated MACE data were an exception to the pooling strategy described above. 
Core Psoriasis Studies 
−  Guselkumab  exposure  across  the  2  Phase  1  core  psoriasis  studies  (PSO1001  and  PSO1002) 
included the following: 
A  total  of  36  healthy  volunteer  and  40  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  received 
single-dose exposure to guselkumab. Among the 40 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
treated across these 2 studies, 10 received a single dose of 100 mg SC guselkumab and 10 received a 
single dose of >100 mg SC guselkumab. 
−  Guselkumab  exposure  across  the  Phase  2  (PSO2001)  and  Phase  3  (PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and 
PSO3003) core psoriasis studies included the following: 
Through the end of the reporting period in the combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 core psoriasis studies, 
1,748 subjects were treated with guselkumab. This number includes subjects who received treatment 
with guselkumab only, those who were crossed over from placebo to guselkumab in studies PSO2001, 
PSO3001, and PSO3002, and those who were crossed over from adalimumab to guselkumab in study 
PSO3002. Of the total 1,748 guselkumab-treated subjects, 1,393 were exposed for at least 6 months 
(24  weeks),  and  728  were  exposed  for  1  year  (48  weeks).  The  majority  of  the  guselkumab-treated 
subjects (90.6%; 1,583 of 1,748) received the 100 mg q8w dose regimen, and 41 subjects (2.3%; all 
from Phase 2 study PSO2001) received a dose >100 mg (200 mg SC). Across all subjects exposed to 
guselkumab  in  the  Phase  2  and  3  core  psoriasis  studies,  the  average  number  of  administrations  was 
5.0.

the reporting period 
The  number  of  subjects  in  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set  (PSO3001  and  PSO3002)  who  received  at 
least 1 injection of guselkumab through the end of the reporting period was 1,367, with 1,036 subjects

treated  for  6  months  and  592  subjects  treated  for  1  year.  Across  these  2  studies,  all  guselkumab-
treated subjects received the proposed dosage regimen of 100 mg, administered SC, at Weeks 0 and 4 
and then q8w thereafter. 
Other Clinical Studies 
Exposure to guselkumab across the five completed studies in other indications or populations included 
the following: 
A total of 304 subjects were exposed to guselkumab across these studies (149 healthy volunteers, 25 
subjects with PPP, 21 subjects with GPP/EP, 109 subjects with RA). 
Adverse events 
Methods of Safety Analysis 
In  addition  to  standard  AE  analyses,  evaluations of events  by  specific  system organ  classes  (SOC)  or 
syndromes of interest were also performed based on the following: 
•  mechanistic  plausibility  in the  setting  of  immunomodulation  via  cytokine  blockade  (infections; 
malignancies);  
• 
identified or potential safety concerns for other anti-cytokine antibody therapies (injection-site 
reactions  [ISR],  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions,  and  neuropsychiatric  events  [suicidal 
ideation and behavior]); or 
AEs acknowledged occurring at an increased frequency within the target population of moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis (adverse cardiovascular [CV] events, including major adverse cardiovascular 
events [MACE] and AEs of psoriasis) which could potentially be influenced by cytokine blockade. 
Common Adverse Events 
Pooled Safety Analysis Set (Core Psoriasis Studies PSO3001 and PSO3002) 
Through the Placebo-Controlled Period (Week 16) 
The overall proportion of subjects with AEs in the guselkumab group was 49.2% and was comparable 
with that for the placebo (46.7%) and adalimumab (49.9%) groups. 
During  the  placebo-controlled  period,  Infections  and  infestations  was  the  SOC  with  the  highest 
proportion  of  AEs  in  the  guselkumab  group  (22.8%),  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  AEs  in  this 
SOC  was  generally  comparable  with  that  for  the  placebo  (20.6%)  and  adalimumab  (23.6%)  groups. 
For all other SOCs, the proportion of subjects with AEs in the guselkumab group was <10%. 
Through the Common Active Comparator-Controlled Period (Week 28) 
Data  for  the  placebo/guselkumab  group  reflect  only  events  after  subjects  assigned  to  the  placebo 
group  had  been  crossed  over  to  guselkumab;  thus,  the  average  duration  of  follow-up  for  the 
placebo/guselkumab  group  through  Week  28  was  shorter  than  that  for  the  other  2  groups,  at 
approximately 12 weeks (average exposure of 6.8 administrations). 
Through Week 28, the overall proportion of subjects with AEs was 60.8% in the guselkumab group and 
64.4% in the adalimumab group. The SOC associated with the highest frequency of AEs through Week

respectively).  The  most  common  AEs  in  this  SOC  were  nasopharyngitis  (12.5%  and  14.5%, 
respectively)  and  URTI  (7.4%  and  6.0%,  respectively).  As  expected  given  the  shorter  exposure  and 
follow-up, the overall frequency of AEs in the placebo/guselkumab group (35.9%) and the frequency of 
AEs  in  most  SOCs  were  lower  than  those  for  the  guselkumab  group.  The  types  of  reported  AEs, 
however, were similar in the two groups. 
Through the End of the Reporting Period (Week 48) 
The  MedDRA  SOC  with  the  highest  event  rates  in  the  guselkumab  group  was  Infections  and 
Infestations  (96.57/100  subj-yrs)  followed  by  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions 
(22.37/100 subj-yrs) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (19.19/100 subj-yrs). 
In  the  guselkumab  group,  the  most  common  AEs  through  Week  48  were  nasopharyngitis  (32.84/100 
subject-yrs),  URTI  (17.24/100  subject-yrs),  headache  (7.29/100  subject-yrs),  arthralgia  (5.95/100 
subject-yrs),  and  hypertension  (5.13/100  subject-yrs).  All  other  AEs  in  the  guselkumab  group  were 
reported  at  rates  of  <5.0/100  subject-yrs,  with  most  individual  AEs  reported  at  rates  of  <1/100 
subject-yrs. 
The exposure-adjusted event rate up to week 48 was 259.42/100 subject-yrs in the guselkumab group 
and 332.84/100 subject-yrs in the adalimumab group.  
A  comparison  of  exposure-adjusted  rates  for  AEs  in  the  guselkumab  groups  across  the  3 analysis 
periods did not show any increase in overall AE event rates over time (330.11, 295.20, and 259.42 per 
100 subject-yrs through Week 16, Week 28, and Week 48, respectively. 
Event  rates  for  most  individual  AEs  for  the  guselkumab  group  were  comparable  with  those  for  the 
adalimumab  group,  with  the  exception  of  some  ISRs,  which  were  lower  for  the  guselkumab  group, 
specifically, injection site erythema, pruritus, pain and swelling. Also of note, the event rate for the AE 
of  psoriasis  was  lower  in  the  guselkumab  group  (1.03/100  subject-yrs  vs  4.77/100  subject-yrs  in 
adalimumab group). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Infections 
Although infection is a theoretical risk for guselkumab based on its immune-modulating mechanism of 
action,  the  data  from  the  pooled  Phase  3  psoriasis  studies  do  not  demonstrate  a  higher  rate  of 
infection for subjects treated with guselkumab than for subjects treated with placebo through Week 16 
or those treated with adalimumab through the longer analysis periods (Week 28 and Week 48). 
−  Guselkumab was not associated with an increased frequency of infections requiring the use of 
oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment relative to placebo through Week 16.  
−  The exposure-adjusted rates for infection AEs in the guselkumab groups were stable over the 3 
analysis periods, and there was no evidence for an increase in rate with increasing duration of 
guselkumab exposure. 
−  With  longer  treatment  (through  Week  28  or  Week  48),  the  frequency/rate  of  infections 
requiring  antimicrobial  treatment  in  the  guselkumab  group  were  numerically  similar  to  those 
for the adalimumab group.  
Assessment report

−  Through  Week  28,  nasopharyngitis  and  URTI  continued  to  be  the  most  common  individual 
infection  AEs  reported  in  the  guselkumab  group  (11.5%  and  7.4%,  respectively),  and  the 
frequency  of  these  events  was  similar  to  that  for  the  adalimumab  group  (12.9%  and  6.0%, 
respectively). The 3 serious infections in the guselkumab group through the active comparator-
controlled  period  were  bronchitis,  soft  tissue  infection,  and  erysipelas.  Of  note,  none  of  the 
serious infections in the guselkumab group resulted in discontinuation of study drug. 
−  Common  infection  AEs  through  Week  48  in  the  guselkumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis 
(30.58/100 subject-yrs), URTI (17.24/100 subject-yrs), and bronchitis (3.39/100 subject-yrs). 
−  Cellulitis  was  the  only  serious  infection  reported  in  more  than  1  subject  in  the  guselkumab 
group (rate of 0.21/100 subject-yrs). 
−  Serious  infections  occurred  infrequently  in  subjects  treated  with  guselkumab  for  up  to  48 
weeks (event rate of 1.03/100 subject-yrs [95% CI: 0.49, 1.89]) as well as in subjects treated 
with adalimumab (event rate of 1.73/100 subject-yrs [95% CI: 0.75, 3.42]). 
−  The  only  specific  infection  AE  that  was  identified  as  an  ADR  for  guselkumab  was 
gastroenteritis. 
−  There  was  no  evidence  that  the  incidence  of  infections  that  were  serious  or  required 
antimicrobial  treatment  were  more  frequent  in  subjects  switched  from  adalimumab  to 
guselkumab  therapy  compared  with  subjects  who  only  received  active  treatment  with 
guselkumab, or that the types of common infection AEs differed for these 2 groups.

There  were  no  reports  of  active  TB  or  an  opportunistic  infection  in  any  guselkumab-treated  subject 
through  Week  48  in  studies  PSO3001  or  PSO3002.  Active  TB  was  reported  for  2  subjects  in  the 
adalimumab group.  
Study PSO3003 
Among  randomized  subjects,  31.1%  of  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group  and  22.6%  in  the 
ustekinumab group had 1 or more infections; all reported events were nonserious. The proportions of 
subjects with infections requiring oral or parenteral treatment was generally comparable between the 
guselkumab subjects (8.1%) and ustekinumab subjects (6.0%). 
The Applicant performed the additional analyses, which present infections by treatment group and by 
type  of  infection.  The  most  common  type  of  infection  was  viral,  with  the  most  common  AEs  in  this 
category being nasopharyngitis and URTI. By week 16 viral infections was reported in 16.3% subjects 
in  the  guselkumab  group  as  compared  to  13.7  %  and  16.2%  in  the  placebo  and  adalimumab  group 
respectively.  By  week  16 bacterial  and  fungal infections  were  reported  in 3.2%  and  1.7%  subjects  in 
the guselkumab group as compared to 3.8% and 0.7% in the placebos group and 5.2% and 0.7% in 
the  adalimumab  group  respectively.  No  significant  differences  between  the  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab arm were observed by Week 28 and Week 48.   
Malignancies 
Malignancies were infrequent in the guselkumab group through Week 48, and consisted of 6 reports of 
NMSC  (4  reports  of  BCC  and  2  reports of  SCC)  and  3  reports  of  malignancy  other  than  NMSC  (the  2 
events  of  prostate  cancer  reported  through  Week  28  and  an  event  of  invasive  papillary  breast 
carcinoma  reported  after  Week  28).  In  the  adalimumab  group,  there  was  1  report  of  NMSC  through 
Week 48, and no reports of malignancy other than NMSC. The event rates for NMSC through Week 48 
were  0.62/100  subject-yrs  in  the  guselkumab  group  and  0.22/100  subject-yrs  in  the  adalimumab 
group.  Corresponding  event  rates  for  malignancies  other  than  NMSC  through  Week  48  in  these  2 
treatment groups were 0.31/100 subject-yrs and 0/100 subject-yrs, respectively. 
Adjudicated Cardiovascular Events 
For the pooled safety analysis set, there were no CV events in the placebo group. The event rate for 
all  adjudicated  CV  events  in  the  guselkumab  group  was  comparable  with  that  for  the  adalimumab 
group for all 3 analysis periods. 
Through  Week  48,  the  overall  rate  of  adjudicated  CV  events  in  the  guselkumab  group  was  low 
(0.82/100 subject-yrs) and not higher than that for the adalimumab group (1.52/100 subject-yrs):

The  4  adjudicated  CV  events  other  than  MACE  reported  through  Week  48  in  the  guselkumab  group 
consisted  of  the  2  reports  of  hospitalization  for  unstable  angina  and  the  1 report  of  heart  failure 
reported  during  earlier  analysis  periods,  plus  1 event  of  arrhythmia  requiring  intervention  (sinus 
node  dysfunction)  reported  between  Week  16  and  Week  28  in  a  subject  who  crossed  over  from 
placebo to guselkumab. Two of these 4 subjects had established CV disease and all 4 subjects had 
a history of at least 2 CV risk factors.  
• 
A  total  of  4  adjudicated  MACE  were  reported  in  the  guselkumab  group  (event  rate, 
0.41/100 subject-yrs). All 4 subjects with MACE had a history of at least 3 CV risk factors.  
The  event  rate  for  MACE  through  Week  48  in  the  guselkumab  group  was  comparable  to  that  for  the 
adalimumab  group  during  this  analysis  period  (n=2;  0.43/100  subject-yrs).  Both  reports  of 
adjudicated  MACE  in  the  adalimumab  group  were  nonfatal  MIs  that  were  reported  during  the 
placebo-controlled period.  
There were no adjudicated MACE in subjects who crossed over from adalimumab to guselkumab. 
Results of the sensitivity analysis, integrating adjudicated MACE data from study PSO2001 with those 
from  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set,  also  revealed  a  low  event  rate  for  MACE  through  the  end  of  the 
reporting period (0.58/100 subject-yrs [95% CI: 0.21, 1.25] for the Guselkumab 100 mg group) that 
was consistent with that based on data from the pooled safety analysis set alone. 
In study PSO3003 in ustekinumab inadequate responders, there were a small number of adjudicated 
CV events during the randomized treatment period (Week 16 to 40) in the guselkumab (n=4 [3.0%]) 
and ustekinumab (n=1 [0.8%]) group:   
• 
• 
• 
The  2  adjudicated  CV  events,  other  than  MACE,  reported  in  randomized  subjects  in  the 
guselkumab  group  for  study  PSO3003  were  an  arrhythmia  requiring  intervention  (sinus 
bradycardia) and a hospitalization for unstable angina.  
There  was  a  small  number  of  adjudicated  MACE:    2  in  the  guselkumab  group  (event  rate  of 
3.25/100 subject-yrs) and 1 in the ustekinumab group (event rate of 1.70/100 subject-yrs). Of 
note, one of the MACE events in the guselkumab group (MI) occurred in the same subject who 
had the event of unstable angina.  
The adjudicated CV event rates for study PSO3003 were numerically higher than those based 
on adjudicated data from the pooled safety analysis set or sensitivity analysis. The confidence 
intervals for these events rates in PSO3003 were wider than corresponding confidence intervals 
for analyses involving PSO3001 and PSO3002 or PSO3001, PSO3002, and PSO2001, reflecting 
the  imprecision  of  the  point  estimates  due  to  the  small  number  of  events  and  much  shorter 
duration of follow-up for study PSO3003. 
Injection-site Reactions 
Key findings concerning ISRs in the Phase 3 studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 are as follows: 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects with ISRs following guselkumab injection through Week 16 or Week 
48  was  low  (2.6%)  and  lower  than  the  corresponding  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  ISRs 
following adalimumab injection for both analysis periods.  
The proportion of guselkumab or adalimumab injections associated with an ISR was 0.7% for 
guselkumab and 1.3% for adalimumab through Week 48 (rate of placebo injections with ISRs 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 117/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was  0.3%  through  Week  48).  Of  the  50  guselkumab  injections  associated  with  ISRs  through 
Week 48, 90% (n=45) were mild, none were considered serious. 
• 
Injection  site  erythema  remained  the  most  common  ISR  associated  with  injection  of 
guselkumab  (reported  in  1.5%  of  subjects)  or  adalimumab  (reported  in  5.3%  of  subjects) 
through Week 48.  
PSO3003 study  
• 
Injection-site reactions were associated with 1.1% of guselkumab injections, all of which were 
of mild intensity. The types of  ISRs (most common, injection site erythema and injection site 
swelling)  associated  with guselkumab  injection  in  this  study  were  similar  to  those  reported  in 
PSO3001 and PSO3002. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
No  subject  exposed  to  guselkumab  in  studies  PSO3001,  PSO3002  and  PSO3003  experienced 
anaphylactic reactions or serum sickness-like reactions through Week 48. 
Cases  of  angioedema,  urticaria  and  hypersensitivity  have  been  reported  in  the  guselkumab  treated 
subjects.  Urticaria  was  reported  more  frequently  in  the  guselkumab  group  as  compared  to  the 
adalimumab group (1.1% for guselkumab and 0.3% for adalimumab). 
Adverse Events of Psoriasis 
Adverse events of psoriasis were reported at a low frequency (<1%) in the guselkumab group through 
Week  16  or  Week  48,  and  the  frequency  of  these  events  was  lower  than  that  reported  for  the 
adalimumab  group  in  both  analysis  periods.  No  events  of  erythrodermic  or  pustular  psoriasis  were 
reported in the guselkumab group.  
Neuropsychiatric Events 
Clinical  trial  data  available  with  guselkumab  as  of  the  cutoff  date  for  this  application  did  not  suggest 
increased risk of SIB events with guselkumab treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis.  
Pooled PSO3001/3002 Week 100 data submitted confirmed one completed suicide in study PSO3001 in 
a  guselkumab  treated  patient  with  history  of  depression  and  restarted  SSRI  treatment.  SIB  was 
reported in five out of 2576 guselkumab treated patients. 
Analyses of pooled PSO3001/3002 Week 100 data demonstrate that the rates of investigator-reported 
SIB  remain  low  (0.19  events  per  100  subj-yrs).  (In  other  recent  clinical  development  programs  the 
adjudicated  SIB  event  was  0.06/100  subj-yrs  for  secukinumab,  0.14/100  subj-yrs  for  ixekizumab, 
0.45/100  subj-yrs  for  brodalumab  and  0.34/100  subj  yrs  for  apremilast.)  For  ustekinumab  the 
available information is from study 3003 where at Week 40 no SIB events have been reported. 
So far no biological mechanism has been explored indicating possible association of IL-23 inhibition 
by guselkumab and SIB. 
Other Notable Neurologic Adverse Events 
Across the pooled safety analysis set, three neurologic AEs (transverse myelitis, dysesthesia, multiple 
sclerosis) led to discontinuation of guselkumab treatment, one of which was also considered a SAE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 118/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no notable neurologic disorder AEs that were serious or resulted in study drug 
discontinuation reported in the other Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies in plaque psoriasis (PSO2001 and 
PSO3003). 
Immunogenicity (Antibodies to Guselkumab) 
During clinical development, a single validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) method 
incorporating  an  acid  dissociation  step  to  improve  detection  of  anti-guselkumab  antibodies  in  the 
presence of excess guselkumab using the MSD platform was used to detect antibodies to guselkumab 
(ie,  ADAs)  in  serum  collected  from  all  clinical  studies.  Serum  samples  positive  for  anti-guselkumab 
antibodies  were  further  characterized  in  vitro  for  the  neutralization  of  the  biological  activity  of 
guselkumab  (ie,  NAbs  to  guselkumab).  A  validated,  drug-  and  IL-23-tolerant  competitive  ligand 
binding ECLIA method was used to detect neutralizing antibodies to guselkumab in samples from ADA-
positive subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies. Treatment-emergent ADAs are defined 
as ADAs that developed post-treatment in patients with negative ADA screens at base. 
A  total  of  1,730  subjects  in  Phase  2  and  3  psoriasis  studies  who  received  guselkumab  had  post 
treatment  serum  samples that  were  evaluable  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab.  The  overall  incidence  of 
antibodies  to  guselkumab  though  up  to  Week  52  after  exposure  to  guselkumab  was  5.5%  (N=96). 
Titers of antibodies to guselkumab were generally low with the majority (79.2%) being ≤1:160 up to 
52 weeks after exposure to guselkumab. 
An  additional  analysis  was  performed  to  determine  the  incidence  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  in 
subjects  who  received  every  scheduled  guselkumab  administration  through  Week  44  and  had  post 
treatment serum samples that were evaluable for antibodies to guselkumab. Among the 562 subjects 
in the PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies, the incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was 6.0%, which was 
consistent  with  the  incidence  of  ADAs  (5.5%)  in  the  overall  study  population  in  the  Phase  2  and  3 
studies.   
In each individual Phase 2 and 3 study in subjects with psoriasis (PSO2001, PSO3001, PSO3002, and 
PSO3003),  no  apparent  impact  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  on  the  PK  of  guselkumab  was  observed 
between subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab and subjects who were negative for 
antibodies to guselkumab. 
In  the  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  studies  the  development  of  antibodies  to  guselkumab  and  the  titer  of 
antibodies to guselkumab were not associated with a reduction in the clinical efficacy of guselkumab.  
No impact of antibodies to guselkumab on Injection Site Reactions was observed.  
Neutralizing Antibodies to Guselkumab 
All  96  subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  guselkumab  from  a  total  of  1,730  subjects  in  the 
Phase  2  and  3  studies  in subjects  with  psoriasis  (PSO2001,  PSO3001,  PSO3002,  and  PSO3003)  were 
evaluable for NAbs to guselkumab. Seven (7.3%) of 96 subjects were positive for NAbs. Therefore, the 
overall incidence of NAbs in subjects who received guselkumab and had samples that were evaluable 
for ADAs was 0.4% (7/1,730 subjects).

As of the 30 June 2016 data cut-off,  
• 
one death was reported in a guselkumab-treated subject across the entire clinical development 
program,  including  the  core  psoriasis  Phase  2  and  3  studies,  completed  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers,  and  completed  studies  in  other  indications/populations.  This  death  was  due  to  a 
myocardial  infarction  and  was  reported  in  a  subject  with  multiple  cardiac  risk  factors  in  the 
group that received guselkumab 5 mg every 12 weeks in PSO2001.  
After the cutoff date for this submission, the sponsor became aware of 2 additional deaths in ongoing 
Phase 3 studies and further during the evaluation procedure the Applicant provided information about 
all six deaths reported in patients receiving guselkumab. 
•  One death occurred in a guselkumab-treated subject in study PSO3003. This 67 year-old male 
subject  had  an  SAE  of  ‘carcinoma  planoepitheliale  of  unknown  origin’  at  the  time  of  the  final 
(Week 60) study visit in January 2016. 
• 
In study PSO3001 a 43-year-old male subject with a history of depression died approximately 
1  week  after  his  Week  68  visit,  as  a  result  of  a  completed  suicide.  At  screening,  the  subject 
was being treated with citalopram (Celexa) for depression. After the Week 60 visit, the subject 
reported  a  nonserious  AE of  depression  and  citalopram  was  apparently  restarted.  The  subject 
had  been  randomized  to  the  guselkumab  treatment  group  and  was  participating  in  the  open-
label study period. 
•  One death was reported in study PSO3001 as a result of a brain neoplasm with an onset date 
on  study  day  560  in  a  65-year-old  male  subject  randomized  to  guselkumab  100  mg  who 
received  his  first  dose  on  16  Apr  2015.  His  family  reported  that  he  experienced  the  onset  of 
dizziness and became disoriented to time and place. A work-up including a head CT established 
a diagnosis of brain tumor. The study site was subsequently informed that the subject received 
only  palliative  treatment  for  an  astrocytoma,  that  he  developed  pneumonia  secondary  to 
incapacitation and died. 
•  One subject, randomized to guselkumab at baseline in study PSO3002, died due to a diabetic 
coma  on  study  day  623.  This  subject  was  a  54-year-old  male  with  a  history  of  diabetes, 
hypertension  and  PsA.  Other  risk  factors  included  obesity.  The  subject  first  received  study 
medication on 19 May 2015 and had not reported any AEs throughout the course of the study. 
At  the  time  of  death,  the  subject  was  taking  glipizide  and  metformin  for  treatment  of  his 
diabetes, which he began in 2001 and 2008 respectively. He was also taking captopril for high 
blood  pressure  and  amitriptyline  for  insomnia,  which  began  prior  to  study  participation.  The 
subject’s  wife  called  the  investigator  to  report  the  death  due  to  a  diabetic  coma.  No  autopsy 
was performed and no other information is available at this time.  
•  One subject, randomized to adalimumab at baseline and who received guselkumab at Week 28 
in  study  PSO3002,  was  reported  as  experiencing  “sudden  death”  on  study  day  792.  This 
subject  was  a  44-year-old  male  with  a  history  of  PsA  and  cardiac  arrhythmia.  He  had  been 
taking bisoprolol since December 2014, 2 weeks before screening. On study day 700 an AE of 
bradycardia was reported and study agent administration was interrupted. He was treated with 
sotahexal. The last dose of guselkumab was administered on 08 February 2017 (week 108). An 
autopsy was performed, but the result has not been released to the subject’s wife yet. At this 
time no other information is available.

• 
In  relation  to  the  case  report  of  this  sudden  death  (Subject  CNTO1959PSO3002-20181)  the 
applicant will provide the full autopsy report for review in frame of pharmacovigilance reporting 
(PSUR). 
None of these six deaths seems to be causally associated with guselkumab treatment.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
There was no evidence for an increase in the reporting rate for SAEs over time up through Week 48 in 
subjects  treated  with  guselkumab,  and  most  SAEs  reported  in  subjects  exposed  to  guselkumab  were 
single events.  
With longer treatment (through Week 28 or Week 48), the overall frequency and rates of SAEs in the 
guselkumab group were comparable with those for adalimumab. 
In  the  guselkumab  group,  the  exposure-adjusted  rate 
for  SAEs  through  Week  48  was 
6.05/100 subject-yrs and was comparable with that for the adalimumab group. 
The  SOC  associated  with  the  highest  frequency  of  SAEs  through  Week  48  was  Infections  and 
infestations (1.13/100 subject-yrs in guselkumab group; 2.17/100 subject-yrs in adalimumab group).  
SAEs  in  the  Cardiac  disorders  SOC  were  reported  at  comparable  rates  in  the  guselkumab  (0.82/100 
subject-yrs)  and  adalimumab  (1.08/100 subject-yrs)  groups  through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. 
SAEs  of  MI  (unadjudicated  PTs  of  myocardial  infarction  or  acute  myocardial  infarction)  were  reported 
for 3 subjects in the guselkumab group and 2 subjects in the adalimumab group. 
SAEs of note reported in the guselkumab or adalimumab groups included TB, malignancies, and 
neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, a SAE of thrombocytopenia was reported in the guselkumab 
group; the subject’s platelet count decreased to a nadir of 27 kU/L and recovered without intervention 
after discontinuation of guselkumab (within 8 weeks of last dose). 
Laboratory findings 
In  study  PSO3003,  the  frequencies  of  CTCAE  grade  ≥2  abnormalities  in  hematology  and  chemistry 
laboratory  values  were  generally  low  and  comparable  between  the  guselkumab  and  ustekinumab 
groups from Week 16 through Week 40. 
Hematology 
The  frequencies  of  abnormal  hematology  laboratory  values  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  ≥2  in  the 
guselkumab  group  were low  and  comparable  with  those  observed  in the  placebo group  (Week 16) or 
adalimumab group (for each of the 3 analysis periods). 
No  subject  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  a  hematology  value  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  4,  and  only  2 
subjects  (0.2%)  had  a  hematology  value  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  3  (both  of  decreased  lymphocytes) 
through Week 16. 
No  subject  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  a  hematology  laboratory  value  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  4 
through  Week  28.  There  were  2  additional  reports  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  3  hematology 
abnormalities  through  Week  28  in  the  guselkumab  group  (1  report  each  of  decreased  platelets  and 
decreased neutrophils). 
Assessment report

No  subject  in  the  guselkumab  group  had  a  hematology  laboratory  value  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  4 
through  Week  48.  There  were  no  additional  reports  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  3  hematology 
abnormalities  through  Week  48  in  the  guselkumab  group.  The  most  common  Grade  ≥2  hematology 
abnormality through Week 48 in the guselkumab group was low lymphocyte counts, which occurred in 
2.5%  of  subjects.  Most  abnormal  hematology  laboratory  results  reported  through  Week  48  were 
sporadic and eventually improved without alteration or interruption of study drug treatment 
Chemistry 
For all clinical chemistry parameters evaluated, few subjects in the guselkumab group had a laboratory 
value of CTCAE toxicity grade ≥2 through Week 16 (≤1.5%), Week 28 (≤2.5%), or Week 48 (≤2.8%). 
• 
The  frequencies  of  chemistry  laboratory  values  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  2  or  higher  in  the 
guselkumab  group  through  Week  16  were  comparable  with  those  for  the  placebo  and 
adalimumab groups.  No subject in any treatment group had a chemistry laboratory value of 
CTCAE toxicity grade 4 through Week 16. CTCAE toxicity grade 3 chemistry abnormalities were 
infrequent  through  Week  16  in  all  treatment  groups;  decreased  sodium  (reported  in  5 
subjects) and ALT elevations (reported in 2 subjects) were the only CTCAE grade 3 chemistry 
abnormalities  reported  in  more  than  1  subject  in  the  guselkumab  group.  In  all  3  treatment 
groups,  shifts  from  normal  baseline  to  an  elevated  value  in  ALT  and  AST  were  the  most 
common  clinically  relevant  shifts  and  were  reported  for  7.5%  and  5.1%  of  subjects, 
respectively,  in  the  guselkumab  group;  5.4%  and  5.8%  of  subjects,  respectively,  in  the 
placebo group; and in 13.1% and 8.6% of subjects, respectively, in the adalimumab group. 
• 
The  most  common  grade  ≥2  clinical  chemistry  abnormalities  through  Week  28  in  the 
guselkumab  group  were  elevations  in  ALT,  AST,  and  total  bilirubin  elevations,  which  occurred 
in 2.5%, 2.3%, and 1.1%, respectively, of subjects in the guselkumab group and 2.3%, 1.7%, 
and 1.7%, respectively, of subjects in the adalimumab group. There was 1 report of a CTCAE 
toxicity grade 4 chemistry abnormality through Week 28 (elevated AST), and this occurred in a 
guselkumab-treated  subject  in  study  PSO3001.  This  abnormality  was  transient  and  resolved 
spontaneously. 
•  As  observed  for  the  Week  28  analysis  period,  the  most  common  Grade  ≥2  clinical  chemistry 
abnormalities through Week 48 were ALT, AST, and total bilirubin elevations, which occurred 
in  2.8%,  2.7%,  and  1.6%  of  subjects,  respectively,  of  subjects  in  the  guselkumab  group and 
4.2%,  1.9%,  and  2.1%,  respectively,  of  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group.  One  additional 
subject  had  CTCAE  grade  4  clinical  chemistry  abnormalities  (elevations  in  serum  creatinine 
(1114 µmol/L) and potassium (7.3 µmol/L)) through Week 48. This abnormality occurred in a 
guselkumab-treated subject in study PSO3001 and resolved spontaneously. 
Cases of elevated liver enzymes were reported in subject participating in the studies with guselkumab. 
The  number  of  cases  was  small.  In  addition  it  is  noted  that  13  subjects  receiving  guselkumab  who 
experienced CTCAE grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme abnormalities through Week 48 for studies PSO3001 and 
PSO3002, 12 subjects had confounding factors.  
Electrocardiograms 
In study PSO3003, an evaluation of mean changes from baseline in ECG interval values (heart rate, PR 
interval, RR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, QTcB interval, QTcF interval) at Week 16 and Week 40 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 122/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
did not reveal any clinically meaningful changes from baseline in either the guselkumab 100 mg SC or 
ustekinumab group. Postbaseline ECG abnormalities that were not present at baseline were evident for 
2 subjects in the guselkumab group and 5 subjects in the ustekinumab group; the 2 abnormalities in 
the guselkumab group consisted of first degree atrioventricular (AV) block. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  any  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  in  ECG  interval  values  in 
the pooled safety analysis set (nor in the other core psoriasis studies or the completed studies in other 
indications  or  populations).  The  most  common  postbaseline  abnormalities  consisted  of  conduction 
abnormalities (mainly first degree AV block) and T-wave abnormalities (mainly flat or inverted wave). 
Vital Signs 
At Week 16, a high percentage of subjects in PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies had shift from a normal 
baseline  value  to  an  elevated  value  for  diastolic  BP  and  in  systolic  BP  in  all  treatment  groups.  For 
diastolic  BP  the  shift  was  observed  in  23.1%,  19.6%,  and  20.1%  of  subjects  in  the  guselkumab, 
placebo,  and  adalimumab  groups  respectively  and  for  systolic  BP,  the  shift  was  observed  in  33.9%, 
35.5%, and 34.8% of subjects in the guselkumab, placebo, and adalimumab groups.  
Safety in special populations 
Analyses  of  treatment-emergent  AEs,  serious  AEs,  infections  and  the  number  of  subjects  who 
discontinued due to an AE were performed by the  following subgroup: age, gender, race, BMI, weight, 
baseline disease characteristics, geographic region and by previous use of psoriasis therapies.  
The  low  number  of  subjects  in  certain  subgroups  (eg,  subjects  ≥65  years)  or  the  overall  number  of 
subjects with certain types of events (ie, SAEs, discontinuation due to AEs) may limit the interpretation 
of the subgroup data. 
No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
Age 
Overall, fewer than 5% of treated subjects across studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 were 65 years of age 
or  older.  The  frequency  of  subjects  with  1  or  more  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events  and 
subjects who discontinued study agent because of adverse events was higher in subjects ≥ 65 years of 
age in comparison to other age groups.

Table 34 –Summary of key safety events through the end of the reporting period by age group subjects 
treated with guselkumab 
Sex 
At randomization, approximately 70% of treated subjects in the pooled safety analysis population were 
men. Up to week 48, the higher frequency of AE/SAEs and infections were observed in women than in 
men  (67.1%;  4.6%;  46.6%  for  women  and  63.2%;  3.4%  and  40.9%  for  men  respectively).  This 
pattern  was  also  generally  apparent  for the  placebo group  through  Week  16  and  for  the  adalimumab 
group through Week 16, 28, or 48. 
Race 
At  randomization,  approximately  82%  of  subjects  in  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set  were  white  and 
approximately 14% were Asian; thus interpretation of data regarding the impact of race upon safety is 
limited due to the small number of subjects in the other racial subgroups. Of note, both Investigator’s 
Global  Assessment  (IGA)  0/1  and  PASI  90  were  positive  for  2  non-white  subpopulations  (Asian  and 
Black/African  American)  which  shows  that  guselkumab  treatment  is  effective  in  these  populations  as 
well. 
BMI, Weight  
The  mean  BMI  at  baseline  for  subjects  in  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set  was  ~29  and  approximately 
58% of subjects weighed ≤90 kg and approximately 42% weighed >90 kg across the three treatment 
groups.  No  trends  were  observed  with  regard  to  differences  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs, 
SAEs, infections, or who discontinued due to an AE as a function of baseline BMI or weight for any of 
the 3 analysis periods. In addition, there was no evidence that comparisons of the safety profile for the 
Assessment report

guselkumab  group  with  the  placebo  group  (Week  16)  or  adalimumab  groups  (Weeks  16,  28,  or  48) 
differed as a function of baseline BMI or weight. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics, Previous Use of Psoriasis Therapies 
Higher reporting rates for AEs and infections among subjects who had ever had prior treatment with 
phototherapy compared with those who had never received such therapy were reported in the 
guselkumab group (e.g phototherapy used in the past: AE 68.1%, infections 47.8%; phototherapy 
never used in the past AE 59.7%, infections 36.0%).  This trend was also observed in other treatment 
groups. No other consistent trend was apparent across the analysis periods in the reporting rates for 
AEs, infections, SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation as a function of prior use of nonbiologic or 
biologic psoriasis medications or disease characteristics (PASI, IGA, BSA)  for the guselkumab group. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
An  in  vitro  study  using  human  hepatocytes  showed  that  IL-23  at  levels  of  10  ng/mL  did  not  alter 
human  CYP  enzyme  expression  or  activities  (CYP1A2,  2B6,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  or  3A4).  These  results 
suggest  that  the  likelihood  of  therapeutic  proteins-drug  interactions  between  guselkumab  and  CYP 
substrates is low.  
A phase 1, Open-label, Drug Interaction Study to Evaluate the Effect of Guselkumab (CNTO 1959) on 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Activities Following a Single Subcutaneous Administration in Subjects 
with Moderate to Severe Plaque-type Psoriasis” was completed during the evaluation procedure.  
The  results  from  the  in  vivo  study  indicate  that  systemic  exposures  of  midazolam,  S-warfarin, 
omeprazole, dextromethophan and caffeine (probe substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
and  CYP1A2,  respectively)  were  not  affected  by  treatment  with  guselkumab  indicating  interactions 
between  guselkumab  and  CYP  substrates  (CYP3A4,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  and  CYP1A2)  are 
unlikely in subjects with psoriasis. These results are reflected in the SmPC Section 4.5 ‘Interaction with 
other medicinal products and other forms of interaction’. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study PSO3001 and Study PSO3002 
Discontinuation of treatment with guselkumab 100 mg SC for an AE(s) was infrequent in PSO3001 and 
PSO3002,  and  the  frequency  of  discontinuation  of  study  drug  due  to  AEs  was  similar  for  the 
guselkumab and placebo groups through Week 16. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  an  increase  in  the  event  rate  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
guselkumab  therapy  over  time.  Additionally,  most  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  guselkumab 
treatment were single events. 
The  overall  frequency  and  rates of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  no  higher  for  the  guselkumab 
group than for the adalimumab group for the Week 28 and Week 48 analysis periods. 
In  the  guselkumab  group,  all  individual  AEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug  through 
Week  48  were  reported  at  very  low  rates  of  ≤0.2/100 subject-yrs,  representing  2  or  fewer  subjects 
experiencing the event through the entire reporting period. 
Assessment report

A comparison of event rates for AEs leading to discontinuation for the guselkumab groups across the 3 
analysis  periods  did  not  show  any  increase  in  rates  for  early  treatment  withdrawal  over  time  (4.31, 
3.88, and 2.36 per 100 subject-yrs through Week 16, Week 28, and Week 48, respectively).  
Study PSO3003 
The proportions of subjects who discontinued study drug due to 1 or more treatment-emergent AEs 
were 2.2% for subjects treated with guselkumab and 1.5% for subjects treated with ustekinumab. 
Post marketing experience 
Guselkumab has not been marketed in any country. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Short term risks 
A total of 1,748 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were exposed to guselkumab across 
the Phase 2 and Phase 3 core psoriasis studies (PSO2001, PSO3001, PSO3002, and PSO3003), 728 of 
whom were exposed to guselkumab for 1 year. A considerable number of patients have been exposed 
to guselkumab at the recommended dosage and the safety database is considered sufficient.  
The adverse event (AE) profile for guselkumab was generally comparable with placebo through Week 
16.  The  most  common  AE  in  all  treatment groups  was  nasopharyngitis.  There  was  no  increase in  the 
event rate for AEs with longer exposure to guselkumab, and the types of events reported were similar 
across  the  three  analysis  periods.  The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  one  or  more  AEs  for 
guselkumab through Week 28, as well as the overall AE event rate through Week 48, was not higher 
than  for  adalimumab.  In  general,  the  rates  for  AEs  within  each  SOC  through  Week  28  and  48  were 
similar for the guselkumab and adalimumab groups, with the exception of some ISRs like injection site 
erythema,  pruritus,  pain  and  swelling,  which  were  lower  for  the  guselkumab  group.  The  SOC 
associated  with  the  highest  frequency  of  AEs  across  the  three  analysis  periods  was  Infections  and 
infestations,  the  most  common  AEs  through  Week  48  in  the  guselkumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis 
(32.84/100  subject-yrs),  URTI  (17.24/100  subject-yrs),  headache  (7.29/100  subject-yrs),  arthralgia 
(5.95/100 subject-yrs), and hypertension (5.13/100 subject-yrs). 
The frequency of discontinuation of study drug due to AEs was similar for the guselkumab and placebo 
groups through Week 16. The overall frequency and rates of AEs leading to discontinuation were lower 
for  the  guselkumab  group  than  for  the  adalimumab  group  for  the  Week  28  and  Week  48  analysis 
periods.  A  comparison  of  event  rates  for  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  for  the  guselkumab  groups 
across  the  three  analysis  periods  did  not  show  any  increase  in  rates  for  early  treatment  withdrawal 
over  time.  In  the  guselkumab  group,  the  Nervous  system  disorder  SOC  was  associated  with  the 
highest  number  of  subjects  discontinued  for  AEs through  Week  16  (n=3,  0.4%).  Prostate  cancer  was 
the  only  individual  AE  that  resulted  in  study  drug  discontinuation  in  more  than  one  subject  in  the 
guselkumab group (n=2) through week 28. One subject was discontinued due to SCC of the skin. Most 
AEs leading to discontinuation of guselkumab treatment were single events.  
Potential long term risks 
There was no increase in the event rate for AEs with up to 48 weeks exposure to guselkumab, and the 
types  of  events  reported  were  similar  across  the  three  analysis  periods.  Long  term  safety  has  been 
included in the RMP as missing information.

Six  deaths  were  reported  from  clinical  trials  in  patients  with  plaque  psoriasis  receiving  guselkumab. 
None of them seems to be associated with guselkumab therapy. 
The proportion of subjects with serious adverse events was low in the guselkumab group and similar to 
that for the placebo group through Week 16. The overall event rate for SAEs in the guselkumab group 
was stable across the three analysis periods. The most common SAEs in guselkumab-treated subjects 
were infection-related events. The proportion of subjects with one or more SAEs through Week 28, as 
well as the event rate for SAEs through Week 48, in the guselkumab group was comparable with those 
for the adalimumab group. 
Adverse  events  of  special  interests  evaluated  were  infections,  malignancies,  cardiovascular  events, 
injection site and immune reactions, adverse events of psoriasis and neuropsychiatric events.  
Infections 
Although infection is a theoretical risk for guselkumab based on its immune-modulating mechanism of 
action,  data  from  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set  did  not  demonstrate  a  higher  rate  of  infection  for 
subjects  treated  with  guselkumab  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  placebo  through  Week  16  or 
compared with those treated with adalimumab through the longer analysis periods (Week 28 and Week 
48). These infections were generally mild to moderate in severity, responsive to treatment and did not 
require  treatment  discontinuation.  Nasopharyngitis,  URTI  and  bronchitis  were  the  most  common 
individual  infection  AEs  reported  in  the  guselkumab  group,  and  the  frequency  of  these  events  was 
similar  to  that  for  the  adalimumab  group.  The  overall  event  rate  for  infection  AEs  did  not  appear  to 
increase  over  time  in  subjects  receiving  active  treatment  with  guselkumab,  and  were  97.90,  91.32, 
and 97.69 per 100 subject-yrs through Week 16, Week 28, and Week 48, respectively. 
Serious  infections  with  guselkumab  were  infrequent,  with  most  being  single  events  without  a  clear 
pattern.  Regarding  tuberculosis,  subjects  with  latent  TB  based  on  a  newly  identified  positive  TB  test 
during  screening  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  study  if  active  TB  was  ruled  out  and  appropriate 
treatment  for  latent  TB  was  initiated  before  or  simultaneously  with  the  first  administration  of 
guselkumab. A small percentage of subjects in studies PSO3001 (5.9%) and PSO3002 (8.1%) received 
concomitant  treatment  for  latent  TB  during  the  study.  No  events  of  tuberculosis  or  opportunistic 
infection were reported in guselkumab-treated subjects. Although the lack of latent TB reactivation is 
reassuring,  since  only  subjects  with  newly  identified  positive  TB  test  were  eligible  for  study 
participation who were also concomitantly receiving antituberculosis therapy the amount of information 
on  the  effect  of  IL23  depletion  on  possible  TB  reactivation/antituberculotic  immune  defense  is 
considered  scarce.  The  event  rate  for  serious  infections  through  Week  48  was  1.03/100  subject-yrs 
(95%  confidence  interval:  0.49,  1.89)  in  the  guselkumab  group  and  1.73/100  subject-yrs  (95%  CI: 
0.75, 3.42) in the adalimumab group.  
Cellulitis was the only serious infection reported in more than 1 subject in the guselkumab group (rate 
of 0.21/100 subject-yrs). 
Additional  analyses  were  performed,  which  present  infections  by  treatment  group  and  by  type  of 
infection.  The  most  common  type  of  infection  was  viral,  with  the  most  common  AEs  in  this  category 
being  nasopharyngitis  and  URTI.  By  week  16  viral  infections  was  reported  in  16.3%  subjects  in  the 
guselkumab  group  as  compared  to  13.7  %  and  16.2%  in  the  placebo  and  adalimumab  group 
respectively.  By  week  16 bacterial  and  fungal infections  were  reported  in 3.2%  and  1.7%  subjects  in 
the guselkumab group as compared to 3.8% and 0.7% in the placebos group and 5.2% and 0.7% in 
the  adalimumab  group  respectively.  No  significant  differences  between  the  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab arm were observed by Week 28 and Week 48.

Based on the biological target and previous experiences with immune-modulating biological medicinal 
products in real life, serious infections are addressed as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies among subjects treated with guselkumab were reported infrequently through Week 48 in 
the pooled safety analysis set, and consisted of six reports of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and 
three reports of other malignancies (prostate cancer and invasive papillary breast carcinoma).  
The  event  rate  for  NMSC  through  Week  48  was  0.62/100  subject-yrs  in  the  guselkumab  group  and 
0.22/100 subject-yrs in the adalimumab group. Corresponding event rates for malignancies other than 
NMSC  through  Week  48  in  the  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  groups  were  0.31/100  subject-yrs  and 
0/100 subject-yrs, respectively.  
During the evaluation procedure, the Applicant provided follow up results regarding malignancies and a 
discussion  on  the  background  rates  of  malignancies  among  psoriasis  patients,  particularly  for  non-
melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. Data demonstrates that malignancies continue to occur 
infrequently among guselkumab-treated subjects, and the higher event rate of malignancies reported 
for  the  guselkumab  group  in  comparison  to  the  adalimumab  group  noted  through  the  end  of  the 
reporting period in the original MAA submission is no longer evident with longer term follow up. 
During  the  evaluation  procedure,  the  Applicant  completed  Week  100  database  locks  for  both  the 
PSO3001  and  PSO3002  studies  with  723  subjects  with  at  least  2  years  of  exposure  to  guselkumab. 
This exposure is still considered short to draw any final conclusions as to the etiology of the observed 
malignant diseases. 
The  malignancy  rates  based  on these pooled  Week 100 data  are  consistent  with  those at  the time of 
the  initial  submission,  and  are  similar  to  those  reported  in  the  literature  among  patients  with  plaque 
psoriasis and with that observed for other treatments in patients with psoriasis. 
Considering the theoretical risk of malignancy associated with all immunomodulating agents, including 
guselkumab, malignancies are considered as an important potential risk in the risk management plan. 
The  Applicant  has  committed  to  monitor the  risk  of  malignancy  through  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities and will re-evaluate the need for updating Section 4.4 of SmPC Warnings and Precautions as 
more safety information becomes available. 
Cardiovascular Events 
For the pooled safety analysis set, the event rate for adjudicated MACE in the guselkumab group was 
comparable with that for the adalimumab group through Week 28 and Week 48. In the Phase 3 study 
in  ustekinumab  inadequate  responders  (PSO3003),  adjudicated  MACE  occurred  in  2  subjects  in  the 
guselkumab group (1.5%) and 1 subject in the ustekinumab group (0.8%), thus event rate (3.25/100 
subject-yrs)  was  significantly  higher  than  in  other  studies  during  the  randomized  treatment  period 
(Week 16 to 40).  
It  was  further  clarified  that  concerning  MACE  rate  in  study  PSO3003  due  to  the  small  number  of 
guselkumab  treated  subjects  and  shorter  duration  of  follow-up,  data  are  imprecise  and  a  better 
estimate of MACE rates for guselkumab can be derived from the pooled data for studies PSO3001 and 
PSO3002.  
CHMP considered that there is currently no evidence for any increase in MACE events in adult patients 
with plaque psoriasis.

Injection-site and Hypersensitivity Reactions 
ISR were reported in a higher incidence in patients treated with guselkumab than in the placebo group, 
but  lower  than  following  adalimumab  injection.  Injection  site  erythema  remained  the  most  common 
ISR associated with injection of guselkumab (reported in 1.5% of subjects) or adalimumab (reported in 
5.3% of subjects) through Week 48. Most injection site reactions were mild in severity and did not lead 
to treatment discontinuation. 
No  cases  of  anaphylactic  reaction  or  serum  sickness  like  reaction  were  reported  among  guselkumab-
treated  subjects  in  either  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set  or  in  the  other  core  Phase  2  or  3  psoriasis 
studies  (PSO2001,  PSO3003).  Nevertheless  serious  hypersensitivity  is  mentioned  in  the  RMP  as 
important potential risk, as this could potentially be expected with this biological product. 
No  association  between  injection  site  reactions  and  treatment-emergent  anti-drug  antibodies  was 
established.  
Information on serious hypersensitivity reactions are addressed in 4.4 of SmPC.  
Cases  of  angioedema,  urticaria  and  hypersensitivity  have  been  reported  in  the  guselkumab  treated 
subjects.  Urticaria  was  reported  more  frequently  in  the  guselkumab  group  as  compared  to  the 
adalimumab group (1.1% for guselkumab and 0.3% for adalimumab).  
Adverse Events of Psoriasis 
Adverse events of psoriasis were reported at a low frequency (<1%) in the guselkumab group through 
Week  16  or  Week  48,  and  the  frequency  of  these  events  was  lower  than  that  reported  for  the 
adalimumab  group  in  both  analysis  periods.  No  events  of  erythrodermic  or  pustular  psoriasis  were 
reported in the guselkumab group.  
Neuropsychiatric Events 
There  are  data  suggesting  that  depressive  symptoms  and  suicidal  ideation  are  more  frequent  among 
patients with psoriasis than in the general population although no firm connection has been established 
so  far.  Across  all  completed  or  ongoing  Phase  1,  Phase  2,  or  Phase  3  studies  in  plaque  psoriasis  or 
other indications, one event of completed suicide (the patient had a history of depression and suicidal 
ideation),  four  events  of  suicidal  ideation  and  one  case  of  suicidal  behaviour  was  reported  in 
guselkumab-treated subjects based on submitted pooled PSO3001/3002 Week 100 data. 
Incidence  rates  of  adjudicated  suicidal  ideation  and  behavior  (SIB)  events  based  on  the  Columbia 
Classification  Algorithm  of  Suicide  Assessment  for  the  pooled  safety  analysis  set  were  0.10  (0.00, 
0.57)  and  0.43  (0.05,  1.57)  per  100  subject-yrs  in  the  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  groups, 
respectively, through Week 48. These rates were based on a single nonserious AE of suicidal ideation 
in a guselkumab-treated subject and two SAEs of suicide attempt in adalimumab-treated subjects. The 
guselkumab-treated subject had a history of depression and suicidal ideation.  
Analysis  of  pooled  PSO3001/3002  Week  100  data  for  guselkumab  demonstrate  that  the  rates  of 
investigator-reported  SIB  is  low  (0.19  events  per  100  subj-yrs),  is  similar  to  ixekizumab  (0.14/100 
subj-yrs), is above of secukinumab (0.06/100 subj-yrs) and appears to be more favorable than that for 
brodalumab (0.45/100 subj-yrs) and for apremilast (0.34/100 subj yrs). 
Although it is agreed that a causal association between treatment with guselkumab and an increased 
risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour has not been established, continuous monitoring for such events 
through  routine  pharmacovigilance,  and  periodical  re-evaluation  of  emerging  data  is  strongly 
supported.

Laboratory Findings 
The  frequencies  of  abnormal  hematology  laboratory  values  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  ≥2  in  the 
guselkumab  group  were  low  (through  Week  16  (≤1.5%),  Week  28  (<2.0%), and  Week  48  (≤2.6%)) 
and comparable with those observed in the placebo group (Week 16) or adalimumab group (for each 
of the three analysis periods). 
Additional  data  concerning  the  potential  relationship  between  systemic  blockade  of  IL-23  and 
decreases in  neutrophil  and  platelet  counts  was  provided.    This  data  demonstrated  decreases in  both 
neutrophil  and  platelet  counts  greater  on  guselkumab  treatment  than  on  placebo,  but  less  than 
observed  for  adalimumab.  These  decreases  were  mostly  small  (within  the  normal  range)  and  of  no 
clinical relevance. 
There were no CTCAE Grade 4 decreases in neutrophil or platelet counts and there was a single Grade 
3  decrease  in  neutrophil  counts  and  a  single  Grade  3  decrease  in  platelet  counts  among  all 
guselkumab-treated subjects. 
There  was  no  unique  time  course  observed  for  the  onset  of  these  abnormalities  in  the  guselkumab 
group and there was no clear evidence that the occurrence of the neutrophil abnormalities resulted in 
an increased frequency of infections. 
For all clinical chemistry parameters evaluated, few subjects in the guselkumab group had a laboratory 
value of CTCAE toxicity grade ≥2 through Week 16 (≤1.5%), Week 28 (≤2.5%), or Week 48 (≤2.8%). 
The  most  common  Grade  ≥2  clinical  chemistry  abnormalities  were  ALT,  AST,  and  total  bilirubin 
elevations. 
No trends were observed that suggested any association between guselkumab and changes in routine 
laboratory parameters. 
Cases of elevated liver enzymes were reported in subject participating in the studies with guselkumab. 
The  number  of  cases  was  small.  In  addition  it  is  noted  that  13  subjects  receiving  guselkumab  who 
experienced CTCAE grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme abnormalities through Week 48 for studies PSO3001 and 
PSO3002, 12 subjects had confounding factors.  
Based  on  the  currently  available  data  a  causal  association  between  treatment  with  guselkumab  and 
increased  liver  enzymes  has  not  been  established.  In  addition,  in  general  serious  drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity is rare with existing biologic agents although the risk exists. 
Liver function tests will continue to be monitored in the clinical trial and postmarketing setting. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  any  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  in  ECG  interval  values  in 
the pooled safety analysis set (nor in the other core psoriasis studies or the completed studies in other 
indications or populations). 
At Week 16, a high percentage of subjects in PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies had shift from a normal 
baseline value to an elevated value for diastolic BP and in systolic BP in all treatment groups.  There is 
no  obvious  explanation  for  the  observed  shifts  from  normal  to  elevated  blood  pressure.  As  these 
changes  were  observed  in  a  comparable  proportion  of  subjects  in  all  treatment  groups  suggest  it  is 
unlikely  that  these  findings  are  attributable  to  exposure  to  guselkumab.  Blood  pressure  is  routinely 
assessed in clinical trials with guselkumab and hypertension will be added as a specific safety topic in 
PSURs.

Overall,  no  trends  were  apparent  with  regard  to  differences  between  the  guselkumab  and  placebo 
groups  (through  Week  16)  or  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  groups  (through  Week  16,  Week  28,  or 
Week  48)  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs,  SAEs,  infections,  or  who  discontinued  due  to  AEs, 
when  evaluated  by  demographics,  baseline  disease  characteristics,  prior  medications  or  therapies  for 
psoriasis,  or  geographic  region.  The  low  number  of  subjects  in  certain  subgroups  (eg,  subjects  ≥65 
years,  70%  of  treated  subjects  were  men,  82%  of  subjects  were  white)  or  the  overall  number  of 
subjects with certain types of events (ie, SAEs, discontinuation due to AEs) may limit the interpretation 
of the subgroup data. 
The  frequency  of  subjects  with  1  or  more  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events  and  subjects  who 
discontinued  study  agent  because  of  adverse  events  was  higher  in  subjects  ≥  65  years  of  age  in 
comparison  to  other  age  groups.  However  as  the  number  of  subjects  exposed  was  small,  final 
conclusion in relation to this issue cannot be made. In addition the same trend was observed in other 
treatment groups.  
Use  in  patients  ≥ 65  years  of  age  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  missing  information  in  the  safety 
specification.  Analysis  of  use  in  patients  ≥ 65  years  of  age  will  be  provided  in  the  PBRER/PSUR.  No 
additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  are  deemed  necessary.  A  statement  addressing  the  limited 
experience with guselkumab in patients ≥65 years of age has been included in the SmPC section 4.2 
accordingly.  
At randomization, approximately 70% of treated subjects in the pooled safety analysis population were 
men. Up to week 48, the higher frequency of AE/SAEs and infections were observed in women than in 
men  (67.1%;  4.6%;  46.6%  for  women  and  63.2%;  3.4%  and  40.9%  for  men  respectively).  This 
pattern  was  also  generally  apparent  for the  placebo group  through  Week  16  and  for  the  adalimumab 
group through Week 16, 28, or 48. 
Higher  reporting  rates  for  AEs  and  infections  among  subjects  who  had  ever  had  prior  treatment  with 
phototherapy  compared  with  those  who  had  never  received  such  therapy  were  reported  in  the 
guselkumab  group  (e.g  phototherapy  used  in  the  past:  AE  68.1%,  infections  47.8%;  phototherapy 
never used in the past AE 59.7%, infections 36.0%).  This trend was also observed in other treatment 
groups  
Information on long term safety and the treatment of certain subpopulations of patients, as treatment 
of  pediatric  patients,  patients  with  severe  hepatic  and  renal  impairment,  pregnant  and  breastfeeding 
patients, treatment of the very elderly is missing and is mentioned as missing information in the RMP. 
Immunological events 
Approximately 5.5 % of patients treated with guselkumab at the recommended dosing regimen 
developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titers and not associated with reduced 
clinical response up to 48 weeks of treatment. Approximately 0.4 % of patients treated with 
guselkumab had confirmed neutralizing antibodies. An association between immunogenicity and 
treatment emergent adverse events has not been established. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although the overall adverse event rates of guselkumab in the pooled data and for Study PSO3003 are 
considered  to  be  similar  to  the  active  comparator  adalimumab  and  ustekinumab  respectively,  the 
safety  profile  of  guselkumab  seems  to  be  considerably  more  favorable  than  that  of  the  TNF  inhibitor

treatments  especially  in  terms  of  serious  infections,  hypersensitive  reactions,  autoimmune  diseases, 
nervous system and cardiac disorders.  
The  long  term  safety  of  guselkumab  was  evaluated  following  48  week  treatment  at  submission,  and 
since then the Applicant has completed Week 100 database locks for both the PSO3001 and PSO3002 
studies with 723 subjects with at least 2 years of exposure to guselkumab. However, considering the 
length of tumor induction still no conclusions concerning the possible etiology/causality of the observed 
malignant diseases can be made.  
One event of completed suicide, four events of suicidal ideation and one case of suicidal behaviour was 
reported in guselkumab-treated subjects as of Week100; this will be monitored in the post marketing 
phase.  
Approximately  5.5  %  of  patients  treated  with  guselkumab  at  the  recommended  dosing  regimen 
developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titers and not associated with reduced 
clinical response up to 48 weeks of treatment. 
Serious infections, malignancies, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and serum sickness) 
and major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE] are identified as important potential risks and will be 
followed during the extension of the two clinical studies 3001 and 3002 post approval. 
Information on long term safety and the treatment of certain subpopulations of patients, as treatment 
of  pediatric  patients,  patients  with  severe  hepatic  and  renal  impairment,  patients  pregnant  and 
breastfeeding, treatment of the elderly is missing and is mentioned as missing information in the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indication for guselkumab is as follows: 
Tremfya  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  who  are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
Psoriasis is a chronic, non-communicable, painful, immunologically-mediated, disfiguring and disabling 
inflammatory skin disease for which there is no cure and with great negative impact on patients’ 
quality of life (QoL). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite the availability of multiple therapeutic modalities, the treatment of chronic moderate to severe 
psoriasis  remains  challenging.  Although  various  topical  treatments  (eg,  steroids,  tar,  anthralin 
[dithranol], calcipotriene, and tazarotene) are commonly used to treat milder cases of psoriasis, they 
are generally not suitable for treating more severe forms of the disease. Moreover, topical steroids can 
be  associated  with  adverse  events  (AEs)  such  as  skin  atrophy,  striae  formation,  suppression  of  the 
hypothalamic  pituitary  adrenal  axis,  and  tachyphylaxis.  Phototherapy  (narrowband  or  broadband 
ultraviolet  B  [UVB]  or  the  combination  of  psoralen  [a  photosensitizing  drug]  plus  ultraviolet  A  light 
[PUVA]) is often effective and generally well tolerated but inconvenient (2 to 3 treatments weekly) and 
sometimes  unavailable  due  to  the  need  for  specialized  equipment.  Therefore,  compliance  and 
subsequently efficacy are rarely sustained over the long-term. Toxicities include sunburn, photo-aging, 
and increased risk of skin cancer, particularly with PUVA. 
Conventional  systemic  therapies  include  MTX,  acitretin,  and  cyclosporine.  Although  effective,  each  is 
associated  with  significant  toxicities,  particularly  organ  damage  with  long-term  administration,  and 
each agent has recommended limitations for long-term administration. Rotational therapy is employed 
to  minimize  these  significant  side  effects,  though  no  evidence  exists  that  rotational  strategies  can 
lessen the risk of serious adverse events (SAE). The chronicity of psoriasis, the cumulative toxicities of 
these agents and the restrictions with their lifetime use often make these agents unsuitable as a long-
term solution. Apremilast, an oral selective inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 4, was recently 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 138/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  psoriasis.  Safety  and  tolerability  concerns  for  apremilast  include 
diarrhea, depression, weight decrease, and drug interactions. 
A  variety  of  biologic  systemic  therapies  have  been  developed  and  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
psoriasis,  including  anti-tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα)  agents  (infliximab,  adalimumab, 
etanercept),  an  IL-12/23  antagonist  (ustekinumab),  and  more  recently,  IL-17A 
inhibitors 
(secukinumab  and  ixekizumab).  These  agents  are  generally  well-tolerated,  and  unlike  conventional 
systemic agents, are not associated with cumulative toxicities that limit longer-term safety. However, 
as  immunomodulatory  agents  they  have  the  potential  to  increase  risk  for  infection  and  malignancy. 
Concerns  for  anti-IL-17  class  agents  also  include  Crohn’s  disease,  neutropenia,  and  mucosal  candida 
infections. 
While the response rates of available treatments, including those for more stringent measures of 
efficacy, have increased over time, there is still substantial room for improving the proportion of 
patients that achieve clear skin. In addition, the currently available treatments have practical 
limitations due to tolerability, toxicity, safety risks, and/or issues with ease of use or convenience. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  efficacy  of  guselkumab  in  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adults  is 
supported by analyses from 6 core psoriasis studies: two phase 1 studies: PSO1001 and PSO1002, one 
phase 2 dose-ranging study: PSO2001 (X-PLORE) and three phase 3 studies:  PSO3001  (VOYAGE  1), 
PSO3002 (VOYAGE 2) and PSO3003 (NAVIGATE). Guselkumab treatment was compared with placebo 
and  adalimumab treatment  in both  PSO3001  and  PSO3002.  Study  PSO3003 examined  the efficacy  of 
guselkumab  in  subjects  with  an  inadequate  response  to  ustekinumab.  The  longer-term  efficacy  and 
safety  of  guselkumab  is  being  assessed  in  4-year  extensions  of  studies  PSO3001  and  PSO3002  (ie, 
both studies will have an overall study duration of 5 years). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  the  2  placebo-  and  adalimumab-controlled  Phase  3  studies  (PSO3001  and  PSO3002),  guselkumab 
100  mg  at  Weeks  0,  4  and  q8w  thereafter demonstrated  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  efficacy 
relative  to  placebo  and  adalimumab  across  multiple  endpoints  and  subpopulations.  The  primary 
endpoints  have  been  met:  70-73%  of  guselkumab-patients  achieved  PASI  90  response  and  85% 
cleared or almost cleared (IGA 0/1 response). Corresponding data for placebo arm were 2.4-2.9% and 
for  adalimumab  treatment:  67%  at  week  16.  Around  40%  of  guselkumab-patients  attained  complete 
clearing: the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 100 response was 37.4% at Week 16, reached a 
maximum  efficacy  response  of  49.8%  by  Week  32  and  was  maintained  at  Week  48  (47.4%) 
(Adalimumab:  26-28%  at  week  16).  Clinical  response  was  similarly  robust  at  week  24,  even  some 
additional numerical improvement could be observed with guselkumab. Response could be maintained 
up to 48 weeks. The superior efficacy of guselkumab was evident across all endpoints and thresholds. 
Onset  of  effect  was  apparent  from  week  2,  separation  from  adalimumab  was  evident  from  week  8 
onwards.  
Consistent improvements were observed across studies PSO3001 and PSO3002 in scalp psoriasis (ss-
IGA 0/1: 80 vs. 10-15%), nail psoriasis (NAPSI% improvement: 35-39% vs. c.a.1), and hand or foot 
psoriasis  (hf-PGA:  73-73%  vs.  14%)  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at 
Week 16. 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 139/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Across both studies (PSO3001 and PSO3002) significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes of 
DLQI (DLQI 0/1: 51-56% vs. 3-4%) and PSSD (clinically meaningful change in both symptom and sign 
scores:  73%  vs.  4-14%)  were  observed  in  the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group. 
Significantly  better  improvements  in  patient-reported  outcomes  of  DLQI  (60%  vs.  40%)  and  PSSD 
(clinically  meaningful  change:  around  70%  vs.  60%)  were  also  observed  in  the  guselkumab  group 
compared with the adalimumab group at Week 24. The magnitude of improvements of these patient-
reported outcomes  from baseline  within  treatment  groups  was  consistent  between  the  2  studies,  and 
treatment differences were also consistent between the 2 studies. 
At Week 48, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab maintenance group were 
PASI  90  responders  compared  with  the  withdrawal  group  (88.6%  vs  36.8%  p<0.001)  in  study 
PSO3002.  Specifically,  among  PASI  90  responders  randomized  to  withdrawal  group,  loss  of  PASI  90 
response was evident as early as 4 weeks after withdrawal of therapy (Week 28) with the median time 
to  loss  of  PASI  90  of  15.2  weeks.  Among  the  PASI  90  responders  in  the  placebo  crossover, 
guselkumab, and adalimumab groups at Week 28, the proportion of subjects with a PASI 90 response 
began to decline in all groups by Week 32 (12 weeks after the last dose of guselkumab and 9 weeks 
after  the  last  dose  of  adalimumab).  The  estimated  median  time  to  the  loss  of  the  PASI  90  response 
was  approximately  16  weeks  from  Week  28  in  the  combined  guselkumab  group  (including  placebo 
crossover and guselkumab groups) and approximately 9 weeks in the adalimumab group. 
Among  the  112  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  who  were  PASI  90  nonresponders  at  Week  28, 
66.1% achieved a PASI 90 response by Week 48 after initiating guselkumab treatment Week 28.   
Those  subjects,  who  experienced  loss  of  therapeutic  effect  (ie,  loss  of  ≥ 50%  of  their  Week  28  PASI 
improvement)  after  withdrawal  from  therapy,  were  followed  for  at  least  4  weeks  after  reinitiating 
guselkumab. Within 4 weeks of re initiation of therapy, the majority of subjects (65%, 13/20) achieved 
a PASI 50 response.  
In  the  randomised  phase  of  study  PSO3003,  efficacy  analyses  based  on  the  number  of  visits  that 
subjects achieved predefined high levels of IGA or PASI responses (out of the 4 visits between Week 
28 and Week 40) demonstrated that the guselkumab group achieved clinical responses approximately 
twice as often as the ustekinumab group ((1.5 visits and 0.7 visits respectively; p<0.001). Differences 
in  response  rate  between  guselkumab  and  ustekinumab  treated  subjects  were  noted  as  early  as  4 
weeks after subjects were randomized. From Week 16 through Week 40, the proportion of randomized 
subjects in the guselkumab group with IGA 0/1 and ≥ 2 grade improvement from Week 16, or PASI 90 
responses  increased  from  Week  16  through  Week  36  and  were  maintained  through  Week  40. 
Separation of the response over time between the subjects randomized to the guselkumab group and 
the ustekinumab group was apparent as early as the first visit after randomization (Week 20) for the 
PASI  90  response  or  Week  24  for  the  IGA  endpoint.  The  separation  increased  over  time  reaching  a 
maximum at Week 40. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Superiority to adalimumab was evident at almost all investigated aspects of psoriasis but improvement 
in  nail  psoriasis  was  not  significantly  different  between  the  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  groups  in 
either studies as measured by f-PGA or NAPSI at Week 24. 
Regarding re-treatment of psoriasis, the number of subjects who reached 8 weeks or longer after re- 
treatment was small and thus limits the interpretation of the results for re-treatment with guselkumab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017

Psoriasis is a chronic disease and guselkumab is for long-term treatment. The data package available 
for  the  time  being  is,  however,  limited  and  further  data  on  efficacy  and  safety  and  in  particular 
immunogenicity  are  needed  to  fully  characterise  benefits  from  guselkumab  treatment  in  the  long-run 
(several studies or sub-studies are ongoing). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Due  to  the  IL-23  pathway  blocking  mechanism  of  action  and  available  experience  from  similar 
compounds serious infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular events require special attention. 
The  most  common  adverse  events  were  infections  and  infestations,  represented  mainly  by 
nasopharyngitis,  gastroenteritis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  in  nearly  a  fifth  or  a  quarter  of 
patients (21.3% / placebo, 23,2% / guselkumab and 24.6% / adalimumab) in the first 16 weeks, with 
slight  increase  to  one  third  in  frequency  in  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  arms  over  the  treatment 
course  of  48  wk  in  the  core  psoriasis  studies  but  with  stable  exposure-adjusted  rate.  Beyond  16wk 
treatment  the  need  for  antimicrobial  therapy  emerged  for  some  infections  in  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab groups, in a similar degree. 
The rate of serious infections was low through Week 48 in the guselkumab (1.03/100 subject-yrs [95% 
CI: 0.49, 1.89]) and adalimumab (1.73/100 subject-yrs [95% CI: 0.75, 3.42]) groups, and consistent 
with the rate of these events reported for ustekinumab (0.93/100 subject-yrs). 
History of latent TB was exclusion criterion; newly identified latent TB cases received concomitant TB 
treatment before or at initiation of study drugs in the trials. No active TB was observed in guselkumab 
treated  patients,  while  two  patients  were  identified  with  active  TB  on  adalimumab  arm  in  the  core 
studies. This issue seems to be appropriately handled in the SmPC. 
Malignancies  are  important  safety  aspects  of  immunomodulatory  therapies.  The  nonclinical  data  on 
IL-23  blockade  show  among  others  role  in  resistance  to  tumour  induction  in  mice,  while  toxicology 
studies  do  not  raise  significant  concerns  for  guselkumab  regarding  carcinogenicity.  The  pooled  data 
from  Phase  3  studies  show  malignancy  rate  similar  to  general  population  and  to  rates  observed  with 
other biologics in psoriasis trials. The event rates for Nonmelanoma skin cancer through Week 48 were 
0.62/100  subject-yrs  (95%  CI:  0.23,  1.34)  in  the guselkumab  group  and  0.22/100  subject-yrs  (95% 
CI: 0.01, 1.21) in the adalimumab group. Corresponding event rates for malignancies other than NMSC 
through  Week  48  in  these  two  treatment  groups  were  0.31/100  subj-yrs  (95%  CI:  0.06,  0.90)  and 
0/100 subject-yrs (95% CI: 0.00, 0.65), respectively. Through Week 48, there was a single NMSC in 
the adalimumab group (0.22/100 subject-yrs). This BCC event was reported for the active comparator-
controlled period. There were no reports of NMSC through Week 48 in subjects who were crossed over 
from  adalimumab  to  guselkumab  (adalimumab/guselkumab  group).  Through  Week  48,  malignancies 
other than NMSC were reported for a total of 3 male subjects in the guselkumab group: the 2 events of 
prostate  cancer  reported  through  Week  28  and  an  event  of  invasive  papillary  breast  carcinoma 
reported  after  Week  28.  All  3  events  resulted in  discontinuation  from  study  treatment  as  required by 
the protocol.  With longer term follow-up (the Applicant completed Week 100 database locks for both 
the PSO3001 and PSO3002 studies with 723 subjects with at least 2 years of exposure to guselkumab) 
malignancies continue to occur infrequently among guselkumab-treated subjects, and the higher event 
rate of malignancies reported for the guselkumab group in comparison to the adalimumab group noted 
through the end of the original reporting period is no longer evident. However, considering the length 
of  tumor induction  still  no  firm  conclusions  concerning  the  possible  etiology/causality  of  the  observed 
malignant  diseases  can  be  made  and  malignancies  are  identified  as important potential  risks  and  will 
be followed during the extension of the two clinical studies 3001 and 3002 post approval.

Event  rates  on  cardiovascular  system  were  similar  for  MACE  in  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  with 
0.41 and 0.43/100 subject years, respectively. These patients had CV risk factors already at entry to 
the study. One fatal MI was reported from a Phase 2 study.  
Clinical  haematology  laboratory  evaluations  showed  few  abnormalities  according  to  CTCAE  toxicity 
grade.  Cellular  elements  and  haemoglobin  altered  both  directions  around  baseline  values  up  to  the 
48wk  cutoff  period,  while  neutrophils  and  platelets  showed  only  decrease.  Few  subjects  in  the 
guselkumab  group  had  a  laboratory  value  of  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  ≥2  through  Week  16  (≤1.5%), 
Week 28 (<2.0%), or Week 48 (≤2.6%).  
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  injection-site  reactions  (ISR)  following  guselkumab  injection  through 
Week 16 or Week 48 was low (2.6%) however higher than in subjects receiving placebo (0.9%).  Only 
0.7  %  of  guselkumab  injections  were  associated  with  an  ISR  through  Week  48  (the  rate  of  placebo 
injections  with  reported  ISRs  in  the  guselkumab  treatment  group  was  0.3%).  Almost  all  of  the  ISRs 
reported  following  guselkumab  injection  were  assessed  as  mild,  none  were  severe  or  considered 
serious, and none resulted in study drug discontinuation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
So far up to two years’ data are available on guselkumab therapy. It is uncertain if this period is long 
enough to fully characterize the favourable and unfavourable effects observed with guselkumab. As the 
overall frequency of adverse events is low, only data from larger patient population over a longer time 
will give a more real picture. 
The  predominant  adverse  events  were  infections,  the  prevalence  of  which  was  similar  in  the 
placebo/guselkumab/adalimumab  arm  of  the  core  psoriasis  studies  (Voyage  1  and  2)  during  the  first 
16  weeks,  but  later  increased  in  the  guselkumab  and  adalimumab  arms  -  in  a  similar  way,  from  a 
quarter to one-third. The exposure-adjusted infection AEs in the guselkumab group are considered to 
be  stable  throughout  48  weeks  of  exposure.  As  the  mechanism  of  action  of  guselkumab  may 
theoretically  increase  susceptibility  to  infections,  long  term  follow-up  data  are  needed  to  better 
understand  the  vulnerability  to  infections  of  guselkumab  treated  patients.  Serious  infections  were 
identified  as  important  potential  risks  and  will  be  followed  during  the  extension  of  the  two  clinical 
studies 3001 and 3002 post approval. 
History  of  latent  TB  was  an  exclusion  criterion;  newly  identified  latent  TB  cases  received  concomitant 
TB  treatment  before  or  at  initiation  of  study  drugs  in  the  trials.  No  active  TB  was  observed  in 
guselkumab treated patients, while two patients were identified with active TB on adalimumab arm in 
the core studies. This issue is appropriately handled in the SmPC. 
The  rate  of  malignancies  was  very  low  or  none  in  Phase  3  studies,  but  in  guselkumab  groups 
somewhat  higher  than  in  adalimumab  groups.  However,  the  low  number  of  events  -  close  to  near-
normal rates - and the short observation period make difficult to draw any firm conclusion. The latest 
malignancy  rates  based  on  the  pooled  Week  100  data  are  consistent  with  those  reported  in  the  Day 
121 responses and in the initial MAA, and are similar to those reported in the literature among patients 
with  plaque  psoriasis  and  with  that  observed  for  other  treatments  in  patients  with  psoriasis.  Serious 
infections,  malignancies,  hypersensitivity  reactions  (including  anaphylaxis  and  serum  sickness)  and 
major  adverse  cardiovascular  events  [MACE]  are  identified  as  important  potential  risks  and  will  be 
followed  during  the  extension  of  the  two  clinical  studies  3001  and  3002  post  approval.  However, 
considering  the  length  of  tumor  induction  still  no  firm  conclusions  concerning  the  possible 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 142/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
etiology/causality of the observed malignant diseases can be made and malignancies are identified as 
important potential risks and will be followed during the extension of the two clinical studies 3001 and 
3002 post approval. 
There  were  CV  risk  factors  in  patients  with  MACE  in  the  pooled  Voyage1  and  -2  studies.  In  the 
ustekinumab  inadequate  responder  PSO3003  study  MACE  events  were  higher  in  guselkumab  than  in 
ustekinumab groups and altogether higher than in the other Phase 3 studies. 
Clinical  haematology  laboratory  values  assessed  during  the  Phase  3  core  psoriasis  studies  show 
decrease in neutrophil and platelet count, in a few patients (1.5-2.6%) up to Grade 2 of CTCAE scale. 
As  cytokines  play  important  role  in  immune  function,  infections  and  malignancies  might  be  affected, 
therefore this uncertain information on neutropenia will be monitored post-marketing.  
No  subject  exposed  to  guselkumab  experienced  anaphylactic  reactions  or  serum  sickness-like 
reactions. Whether guselkumab is associated with the risk serious hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis and serum sickness) is unknown based on the current data and this potential risk will be 
followed up post authorisation in the two clinical studies 3001 and 3002 as described in the RMP.  
Since  experience  in  patients  >65  years of  age  is  very  limited,  SmPC  section 4.2  is  updated to  reflect 
this limitation.  
In  cases  of  three  deaths  were  recorded  in  the  clinical  programme,  one  of  which  occurred  in  the 
guselkumab  arm  the  patient  with  fatal  MI  had  CV  risk  factors.  Regarding  mechanism  of  action  of  the 
investigated  active  substances,  the  cytokine  blockade  induced  by  guselkumab  and  ustekinumab  may 
influence infections, malignancies and cardiovascular events. 
There  are  no  human  data  on  transplacental  exposure  –  which  is  comparable  to  maternal  levels  in 
cynomolgous monkeys – neither on exposure via lactation. Guselkumab could not be detected in milk 
of  cynomolgous  monkeys  28  days  after  injection.  In  humans,  during  the  first  few  days  after  birth 
antibodies may be transferred to the newborns through milk. In this short period, a risk of guselkumab 
exposure to the breastfed child cannot be excluded.  
Based on non-clinical and literature data transplacental exposure is not expected to interfere with 
development of immune system and with infant vaccinations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In  the  two  large  placebo-  and  adalimumab-controlled  Phase  3  studies  guselkumab  demonstrated 
significant  and  clinically  meaningful  efficacy  relative  to  placebo  and  adalimumab.  The  primary 
endpoints  have  been  met:  70-73%  of  guselkumab-patients  achieved  PASI  90  response  and  85% 
cleared  or  almost  cleared (IGA  0/1  response).  Corresponding  PASI 90  data  for  the  placebo  arm  were 
2.4-2.9% and for adalimumab treatment 46.8-49.7% at week 16.  
Around 40% of guselkumab-patients attained complete clearing: the proportion of subjects achieving a 
PASI 100 response was 37.4% at Week 16 (adalimumab: 26-28% at week 16), reached a maximum 
efficacy response of 49.8% by Week 32 and was maintained at Week 48 (47.4%).  
Clinical response was similarly robust at week 24, even some additional numerical improvement could 
be observed with guselkumab. Response could be maintained up to 48 weeks. The superior efficacy of 
guselkumab was evident across all endpoints and thresholds. Onset of effect was apparent from week 
2; separation from adalimumab was evident from week 8 onwards.  
At Week 48, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab maintenance group were 
PASI  90  responders  compared  with  the  withdrawal  group  (88.6%  vs  36.8%  p<0.001)  in  study 
PSO3002.  Specifically,  among  PASI  90  responders  randomized  to  withdrawal  group,  loss  of  PASI  90 
response was evident as early as 4 weeks after withdrawal of therapy (Week 28) with the median time

to  loss  of  PASI  90  of  15.2  weeks.  Among  the  PASI  90  responders  in  the  placebo  crossover, 
guselkumab, and adalimumab groups at Week 28, the proportion of subjects with a PASI 90 response 
began to decline in all groups by Week 32 (12 weeks after the last dose of guselkumab and 9 weeks 
after the last dose of adalimumab).  
Consistent improvements were observed in scalp psoriasis, nail psoriasis, and hand or foot psoriasis in 
the  guselkumab  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Week  16  across  studies  PSO3001  and 
PSO3002  for  subjects  with  an  ss-IGA,  f-PGA,  and/or  hf-PGA  score  ≥ 2  at  baseline  or  with  a  NAPSI 
score  >0  at  baseline  .  In  addition,  in  both  studies,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  guselkumab 
subjects had scalp psoriasis and hand and foot psoriasis improvement compared with the adalimumab 
group  at  Week  24.  Although  guselkumab  treatment  resulted  in  substantial  improvement  of  nail 
psoriasis,  the  effects  observed  were  not  significantly  different  between  the  guselkumab  and 
adalimumab groups in either study as measured by f-PGA or NAPSI at Week 24. 
Patient reported outcomes improved in parallel with the therapeutic effect. 
Antibody development to guselkumab was low and the neutralizing types did not influence efficacy as 
measured by IGA and PASI responses at various thresholds. 
Besides the significant therapeutic effect making even complete clearing possible (thereby significantly 
improving the quality of life of the patient) the adverse events are generally low in frequency, majority 
of  them  below  10%.  Serious  adverse  events  seem  to  be  sporadic.  Relationship  of  most  AEs  with 
guselkumab remains to be further clarified and refined as the low incidence, the relatively short, up to 
two years exposure is short for firm conclusions and further data will be generated post authorisation 
as described in the risk management plan. 
The mechanism of action of guselkumab, inhibition of IL-23 pathway makes development of infections 
or  autoimmun  disease  theoretically  possible.  Infections  have  been  observed  in  low  incidence  and  in 
similar or more favourable frequency and severity to active comparators so far. Targeted collection of 
data on characteristics, patterns, however, should be continued. With proper handling the therapeutic 
benefits of guselkumab seem evidently overweighing the risks. 
Regarding malignancies the role of the cytokine-blockade might be multiple, and with near two years 
data  the  diagnosed  malignancies  in  clinical  trials  were  similar  to  those  in  the  literature  on  plaque 
psoriasis  patients  and  to  those  observed  with  other  treatments  for  psoriasis  This  risk  will  be  further 
monitored in post-marketing. 
Effects of guselkumab on the cardiovascular system also remain to be explored in more detail in longer 
follow-up.  Although  reports  only  on  sporadic  cases  are  available  so  far  which  is  insufficient  to 
demonstrate association with guselkumab therapy, the event rate for all adjudicated CV events in the 
guselkumab  group  was  comparable  with  that  for  the  active  comparator  adalimumab  in  the  clinical 
trials.  (In  the  ustekinumab  inadequate  responder  PSO3003  study  MACE  events  were  higher  in 
guselkumab than in ustekinumab group). 
These  risks  are  adaequately  covered  by  the  SmPC.  Serious  infections,  malignancies,  hypersensitivity 
reactions (including anaphylaxis and serum sickness) and major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE] 
are identified as important potential risks and will be followed during the extension of the two clinical 
studies 3001 and 3002 post approval. 
As  there  are  no  human  data  available  on  exposition  of  the  foetus  or  newborn  during  pregnancy  or 
lactation  the  use  of  guselkumab  in  these  patients  should  be  avoided  or  suspending  breast  feeding 
during guselkumab therapy considering the benefit and risk of either step should be considered.

Of  note,  there  are  nonclinical  data  on  cynomolgous  monkeys  where  the  transplacental  exposure  is 
close  to  the  maternal  levels  without  apparent  influence  on  the  offspring,  while  guselkumab  could  not 
be detected in the breast milk 28 days after injection. Literature data suggest: in humans, during the 
first few days after birth antibodies may be transferred to the newborns through milk. (Hanson et al., 
Ann.  N.Y.  Acad.  Sci.  987:  199–206  (2003).  Hurley  and  Theil,  P.L.H.  McSweeney  and  P.F.  Fox  (eds.), 
Advanced Dairy Chemistry, Volume 1A: Proteins: Basic Aspects, 4th Edition, DOI 10.1007/978-1- 4614-
4714-6_9.)  In  this  short  period,  a  risk  of  guselkumab  exposure  to  the  breastfed  child  cannot  be 
excluded.  
Transplacental  exposure  does  not  seem  to  interfere  with  development  of  immune  system  and  with 
vaccinations. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Statistically significant and highly clinically relevant short-term and longer-term efficacy of guselkumab 
has been shown. Potentially even total clearing of the psoriatic skin can be achieved in a considerable 
proportion  of  patients.  This  remarkable  efficacy  is  accompanied  by  favourable  tolerability  and  safety 
profile, with low rate of adverse events in clinical trials and with no sound pattern of serious adverse 
events  which  seem  to  be  rather  sporadic.  The  beneficial  effects  are  considered  to  outweigh  the 
unfavourable effects seen in the clinical programme.  
Guselkumab  is  recommended  to  be  given  subcutaneously  q8weeks  and  self-administration  is  also 
possible. This is generally convenient for the patients and may contribute to optimum compliance.  
Long  term  efficacy  and  safety  experience  beyond  two  years  is  not  available  yet  –  careful  follow  up 
including focus on events involving the affected IL-23/IL-17 pathways will be done post authorisation 
by means of the long term extension of trials 3001 and 3002 as described in the RMP.  
Unfavourable  effects  have  been  infrequently  observed,  and  are  mostly  mild  in  severity.  Therefore  all 
the  adverse  events  which  might  theoretically  result  from  the  mechanism  of  action  of  guselkumab  or 
which  were  experienced  with  active  substances  with  similar  action  should  be  carefully  prospectively 
monitored,  cases  collected,  analyzed  and  the  information  made  available  to  the  prescribers  and 
patients.  Malignancy,  serious  infections,  serious  hypersensitivity,  cardiovascular  events  and  suicidal 
ideation are the most important and appropriate information to grant marketing authorisation has been 
included in the product information. 
The robust efficacy and the favourable safety profile with low incidence of adverse events makes the 
balance of benefits and risks for guselkumab positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tremfya is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
Assessment report  
EMA/692068/2017  
Page 147/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that the risk-benefit balance of Tremfya is favourable in the following indication:  
Tremfya is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that guselkumab is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

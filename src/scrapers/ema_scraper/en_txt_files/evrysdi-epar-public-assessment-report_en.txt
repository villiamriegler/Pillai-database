Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Having considered the arguments presented by the applicant and with reference to Article 8 of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000, Evrysdi (risdiplam) is considered not similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000) to Spinraza (nusinersen). 
Having considered the arguments presented by the applicant and with reference to Article 8 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, Evrysdi (risdiplam) is considered not similar (as defined in Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000) to Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec). 
Therefore, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the existence of any market 
exclusivity for Spinraza® (nusinersen) in the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy, does not 
prevent the granting of the marketing authorisation of Evrysdi (risdiplam). This finding is without 
prejudice to the outcome of the scientific assessment of the marketing authorisation application. 
Therefore, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the existence of any market 
exclusivity for Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) in the treatment of patients with 5q spinal 
muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and a clinical diagnosis of SMA 
Type 1, or patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the 
SMN2 gene,  does not prevent the granting of the marketing authorisation of Evrysdi (risdiplam). This 
finding is without prejudice to the outcome of the scientific assessment of the marketing authorisation 
application. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance risdiplam contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

atrophy (SMA). The efficacy and safety results from FIREFISH Part 1 and SUNFISH Part 1 
provide sufficient and clinically meaningful evidence to characterise the benefits and risks of

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indication that was applied for was: “Treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a monogenic neuromuscular disorder resulting in severe weakness of 
the limbs, trunk, bulbar and respiratory muscles secondary to failure to gain and maintain functional 
motor nerve innervation of skeletal muscles. SMA is characterised by the dysfunction of alpha motor 
neurons within the anterior horn of the spinal cord, leading to skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. 
It is the leading genetic cause of mortality in infants and young children, with an estimated incidence 
of 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births and carrier frequency of 1 in 40−60 individuals. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder secondary to loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the 
survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene with subsequent loss of SMN protein expression. In humans, 
there are two SMN genes, the SMN1 gene and its paralog SMN2. The SMN2 pre-messenger ribonucleic 
acid (mRNA) undergoes alternative splicing that excludes exon 7 from 85%−90% of mature SMN2 
transcripts, which produces an unstable SMN∆7 protein that is rapidly degraded. Therefore, full-length 
SMN2 mRNA is generated in only 10%−15% of splicing events. Accordingly, patients with SMA lacking 
a functioning SMN1 gene are dependent on their SMN2 gene and SMA is the consequence of 
decreased, insufficient levels of functional SMN protein produced by the SMN2 gene. Children born with 
multiple copies of the SMN2 gene have milder phenotypes, further demonstrating that the 
pathophysiology of the disease is due to insufficient production of functional SMN protein.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 12/293 
 
 
 
 
The severity of spinal muscular atrophy is highly variable and patients with heterogeneous clinical 
features can be classified into phenotypes (Types 0 through 4) on the basis of age at onset and the 
most advanced motor milestone achieved during development; Types 1, 2 and 3 represent 
approximately 99% of the SMA population. Type 0 (congenital SMA) is very rare and most of these 
patients do not survive beyond 6 months of age. Type 4 SMA (adult onset) accounts for only 
approximately 1% of all SMA cases. Patients consistently in all SMA Types have proximal greater than 
distal limb weakness and lower limb greater than upper limb weakness. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with Type 1 (infantile-onset) SMA present before the age of 6 months and most commonly 
have 2 SMN2 copies. At diagnosis, these infants demonstrate reduced motor function compared with 
age-matched healthy infants and uniformly lose motor function over time as assessed with a standard 
instrument for infants with SMA known as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of 
Neuromuscular Disorders. Infants with Type 1 SMA never gain major motor milestones such as sitting 
independently. In addition, they have progressive loss of independent swallowing and respiratory 
function requiring feeding tubes and ventilatory support. This leads to an increased risk for aspiration 
pneumonia and recurrent respiratory infections, with repetitive hospitalisations and a very high risk of 
death. Natural history shows that 50% of infants with Type 1 SMA will have died or required 
permanent daily non-invasive ventilation support by 10.5 months of age and 92% by 20 months of 
age.  
Patients with Type 2 SMA present after the age of 6 months and before the age of 18 months and most 
commonly have 3 SMN2 copies. These children will be able to sit independently and possibly stand but 
never walk independently given the greater amount of weakness in their lower limbs. Natural history 
demonstrates that these patients have a decline in motor function over time, most prominently 
between the ages of 6 and 16 years, as reported in a number of publications with different validated 
motor function measures, i.e., the Motor Function Measure 32-item version (MFM32), the 
Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HMFSE), and the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). 
Affected Type 2 patients also experience other SMA-related comorbidities, including severe scoliosis, 
which may require surgery, possibly as young as 8−10 years old. Joint contractures are also a 
prominent clinical feature as the disease progresses. These contractures lead to stiffness and 
tightening, with the knees, hips and elbows being the main joints affected (Gusset 2020). Collectively, 
these complications limit patients’ independence and their ability to perform important activities of 
daily living. 
Patients with Type 3 SMA present after the age of 18 months and before 36 months and most 
commonly have 3 or 4 SMN2 copies. These children are able to sit, stand, and walk independently. 
Natural history demonstrates that these patients decline in motor function over time most prominently 
during the ages of 10−15 years and nearly a third will lose their ability to walk between ages 3 28 
years. In both Type 2 and Type 3 SMA patients, pulmonary function declines over time and patients 
may need non-invasive ventilation support.  
Patients with Type 4 SMA present in adulthood and have 4−6 SMN2 copies. The clinical presentation is 
during adulthood. Type 4 SMA is very rare and represents less than 1% of all SMA patients and is the 
mildest form of the recognised disease continuum; it is characterised by mild proximal muscle 
weakness, predominantly affecting the leg and hip muscles which may progress to the shoulders and 
arms. SMA Type 4 muscle weakness progresses steadily and slowly over time, but rarely affects 
swallowing or breathing. Life expectancy is not affected in Type 4 SMA.

2.1.5.  Management 
Currently approved treatments have not been shown to increase SMN protein through the whole body 
including the CNS, which is hypothesised to result in greater efficacy than increases of functional SMN 
protein in the CNS alone. Patients with SMA still lack an approved therapy with an easy and 
sustainable route of administration that can be accessed without frequent clinic visits, invasive 
procedures, or concomitant use of additional medicines. Such therapies are critical for achieving 
treatment compliance and thus, the likelihood of treatment benefit, particularly as SMA is a life-long 
chronic disease. 
The intrathecally administered SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen (Spinraza) is 
approved for the treatment of SMA in paediatric and adult patients. Onasemnogene abeparvovec 
(Zolgensma→) is a one-time intravenously administered, gene replacement therapy that uses a non-
replicating adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) capsid to deliver a functional copy of the SMN gene by 
intravenous infusion; it is approved in the United States and Japan for paediatric patients with SMA <2 
years of age. In the European Union (EU), onasemnogene abeparvovec is approved conditionally for 
the treatment of patients up to 21 kg in weight with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 
gene and a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, or with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 
gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to promote physical distancing, as well as changes in hospital 
priorities that postpone elective procedures, have made more difficult the use of nusinersen or 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec.  
Nusinersen (Spinraza®) 
Results of Phase 3 studies in infantile-onset SMA and in later-onset SMA overall demonstrate benefit in 
patients receiving active drug versus sham control. However, by the end of the Phase 3 study 
(ENDEAR) in infantile-onset SMA, 49% of the treated patients did not exhibit an improvement in their 
motor milestones and 39% did not reach event-free survival. For nusinersen intrathecal 
administration, many of the infants and young children with SMA would require anaesthesia to undergo 
the lumbar puncture procedures, and sedation is known to potentiate adverse respiratory reactions. 
Very common adverse reactions linked to lumbar puncture include headache, vomiting and backache, 
identified during clinical trials of nusinersen in patients with later-onset SMA. Post-marketing 
experience with nusinersen has also identified serious infections, such as meningitis, communicating 
hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis and hypersensitivity (frequency unknown). It is also noted that renal 
toxicity, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation abnormalities, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, 
have been observed after administration of other antisense oligonucleotides administered by 
subcutaneous or IV injection in infant and adult patients. Additionally, intrathecal injection may not be 
possible for patients who have developed severe scoliosis, or who have undergone a spinal surgery 
procedure, complications that are present in the majority of Type 2 and non-ambulatory Type 3 
patients. 
In Study BP39054 (JEWELFISH), 77 SMA patients (1−60 years of age) had previously received 
nusinersen. Of these patients, 45% (35 patients) reported inability to continue to receive nusinersen 
secondary to tolerability concerns, treatment-related safety concerns, difficulty in accessing a suitable 
clinical site to perform the injection or inability to undergo intrathecal administration. This means that 
patients who have already had access to nusinersen may be precluded to continue receiving this 
therapy due to medical reasons.

Onasemnogene abeparvovec  
The product uses a non-replicating adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) capsid to deliver a functional copy 
of the SMN gene by intravenous infusion. Treatment includes baseline testing for AAV9 antibodies, 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids (for 30 days or longer with required down-titration over 28 
days) and close safety monitoring of liver function, platelet count and cardiac parameters (troponin-I 
levels) for a period of at least 3 months post treatment, all of which could limit administration for some 
patients. Overall, there is limited experience in patients 2 years of age and older or with body weight 
above 13.5 kg; the safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec in older patients have not been 
established and, if dosed, the high viral loads required could carry safety risks. Given the selected 
population studied to date (albeit ongoing trials) and potential uncertainty around long-term duration 
of efficacy and safety, the impact of this treatment on the overall broad population living with SMA is 
not yet fully known. 
In addition, based on currently available information from the EU approval process there appears to 
exist only small batch sizes available due to the batch allocation strategy being used for the product. 
Thus, the supply of the drug may be limited. In addition, given that Zolgensma is dosed according to 
body weight, the capacity to meet demand for older heavier patients may be an added challenge. 
Non-Therapeutic Management 
Concomitant non-therapeutic management strategies for SMA rely on prevention and treatment of 
comorbidities, such as swallowing and feeding difficulties, scoliosis and thoracic deformity, 
contractures, and respiratory insufficiency. Treatments such as pulmonary hygiene, non-invasive 
ventilation, placement of feeding tubes, mobility and seating support, and physical and occupational 
therapies are supportive, with the goals of improving overall survival, quality of life and of minimizing 
disability. Other forms of intervention such as immunisation, provision of antibiotics and vitamin 
supplementation are also part of the standard of care in SMA. Over time, palliative management for 
the most severe Type 1 SMA patients has been introduced more frequently at home with increased 
levels of technical supportive care such as enteral nutrition, oxygenotherapy, and analgesic and 
sedative treatments. According to a natural history study, none of the assessed patients with Type 1 
SMA had major motor milestone developments, even after the implementation of basic standards of 
care in SMA to improve survival and patients’ care, illustrating the benefits of developing disease-
target therapies.  
About the product 
Risdiplam, an SMN2 mRNA splicing modifier, is an orally (liquid formulation) administered small 
molecule with systemic distribution. 
SMA is caused by a deficiency in SMN protein, and therefore the need to systemically increase SMN 
protein is at the core of the disease intervention across the continuum of SMA phenotypes. Risdiplam 
modulates SMN2 splicing to include exon 7 into the mRNA transcript, thereby increasing the expression 
of full-length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. Systemic administration versus intracerebroventricular 
administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) SMN2 splicing modifier was compared in a 
transgenic animal model where systemic administration conferred a much longer survival benefit and 
most animals given systemic administration showed no signs of motor dysfunction. Therefore, a 
systemic increase in SMN protein with risdiplam is hypothesised to bring greater efficacy in patients 
with SMA than treatments targeting increases of functional SMN protein in the CNS alone. 
Treatment with risdiplam indeed prevents the manifestation of the SMA phenotype in a dose-
dependent manner in the severely affected SMNΔ7 mice. A 2- to 3-fold increase in SMN protein was 
associated with a significant prolongation of animal survival. Analyses of SMN protein in blood, 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 15/293 
 
 
peripheral (muscle), and central (brain) tissues of animals show that similar SMN protein increase is 
obtained in these key organs of interest as compared to blood.  
Specificity of Risdiplam and Therapeutic Margin 
The potency of risdiplam is the result of its high specificity for the SMN2 exon 7 splicing process which 
is believed to be achieved through binding to two distinct sites of the SMN2 pre-mRNA. In patients, 
therapeutic effect in terms of shifting the splicing to inclusion of exon 7 is achieved at a mean exposure 
not exceeding the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for off-target effects observed in 
nonclinical toxicity studies. 
Toxicities associated with off-target effects based on nonclinical studies are of two types: 
• 
Early onset and reversible off-target effects in rodent and non-rodent species: Risdiplam also 
binds to a few secondary splice targets, which all share the same mRNA 5’ splice site. The 
most prominent secondary splice targets contributing to the toxicities (effects on epithelial 
tissues, effect on male germ cells, embryofetotoxicity/teratogenicity and haematological 
effects) are FOXM1 and MADD due to their role in cell cycle and apoptosis (2.4 Nonclinical 
Overview, Section 6.7.2). With the exception of effects on male germ cells, the exposure at 
NOAEL for these reversible toxicities is at least 2.5-fold higher than the exposure required to 
achieve significant therapeutic effect (at a 2-fold increase in functional SMN protein). 
•  Delayed onset, not fully reversible retinal toxicity observed in non-rodent (monkey) only: 
Specific investigations show that secondary splice targets are unlikely to be involved but rather 
a specific biological process in the monkey such as impairment of autophagosomal function. 
Exposures at the NOAEL for retinal toxicity achieve significant therapeutic effect (at a 2-fold 
increase in functional SMN protein). 
Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed with the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the severity of the disorder and the 
fact that the available treatments do not adequately cover the whole population. SMA therapies are 
approved in Europe (nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec), but still a proportion of patients 
remain untreated.  
Risdiplam is an oral solution, to be applied as at home therapy, an easier route of administration, to 
best support a life-long chronic disease. Risdiplam offers a rapid and sustained increase in SMN protein 
synthesis through the whole body including the CNS, an important aspect especially in SMA1 where a 
rapidly progressive disease requires a quick time to effect agent. From a public health perspective, an 
at home therapy is less burdensome than therapies that require regular hospital visits, invasive 
procedures, trained and highly skilled medical staff for their administration, concomitant use of other 
drug therapies with associate AEs, and availability of imagining technology to support drug 
administration, such as CT. 
Considering the inevitable accumulation of disability that all patients with SMA face, and the unmet 
need, there is a need for patients in Europe to gain access to a sustainable non-parenteral treatment 
that can be administered to all eligible (as per the approved indication) SMA patients regardless of 
type and comorbidities, within a reasonable timeframe.

active substance. 
Other ingredients are: mannitol (E421), isomalt (E953), strawberry flavour, tartaric acid (E334), 
sodium benzoate (E211), macrogol/polyethylene glycol 6000, sucralose, ascorbic acid (E300) and 
disodium edetate dihydrate. 
The product is available in an amber glass bottle with a tamper-evident, child-resistant cap which is 
accompanied by 1 press-in bottle adapter, two 6 mL reusable amber oral syringes and two 12 mL 
reusable amber oral syringes, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. Each bottle contains 2 g of 
powder containing 60 mg of risdiplam. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of risdiplam is 7-(4,7-diazaspiro[2.5]octan-7-yl)-2-(2,8-dimethylimidazo[1,2-
b]pyridazin-6-yl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one) corresponding to the molecular formula C22H23N7O. 
It has a relative molecular mass of 401.46 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of risdiplam is inferred from the route of synthesis and further elucidated by a 
combination of elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, 1H NMR and 13C 
NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and crystal structure analysis by X-ray diffraction. Risdiplam is 
achiral. The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), infrared (IR) 
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS). 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic, light yellow or yellow or greyish yellow or greenish yellow 
crystalline powder which may contain lumps.  It exhibits pH-dependent solubility across the 
physiological pH range, being soluble at pH 1 dropping off to being practically insoluble at neutral pH.  
Polymorphism has been observed for risdiplam following extensive screening experiments. Form A is 
the crystalline solid form of risdiplam selected for clinical development and has been used in all clinical 
trials and the proposed commercial finished product. Stability studies have confirmed the stability of 
Form A. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Risdiplam is synthesised in 10 main steps using starting materials with acceptable specifications 
defined in line with ICH Q11 and previous CHMP scientific advice. 
The process is designed to minimise formation of organic impurities and sufficient isolation steps are 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 17/293 
 
 
 
 
included to allow their purge. The fate and purge of potentially genotoxic impurities have been 
investigated extensively. Different impurities are controlled according to ICH M7 options 2, 3 or 4 
depending on the extent of demonstrated process knowledge. The control options are also in line with 
previous CHMP scientific advice. Elemental impurities are controlled in relevant intermediates and in 
the active substance specification by a residue on ignition test. The final crystallisation step ensures 
form A which is then milled to reduce particle size which improves processability during formulation. 
The manufacturing process has been developed following quality by design (QbD) principles, including 
risk assessment to identify factors influencing the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of risdiplam. These 
were then prioritised and investigated using a combination of univariate and multivariate studies. The 
critical material attributes (CMAs) of the starting materials and intermediates were identified and limits 
for various properties were set and justified based on fate of impurities studies and the demonstrated 
understanding of the manufacturing process. Critical process parameters (CPPs) were defined through 
experimentation with those having a likely significant impact on a CMA or CQA considered to be 
critical. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for critical parameters for the synthetic 
steps. It has been stated that for each step, only 1 parameter will be changed from its set-point or 
normal operating range (NOR) at any one time. For the last steps (crystallisation and milling), design 
spaces are claimed. For both steps, suitable ranges have been defined for quantities of input materials, 
and process parameters such as times and temperatures for individual unit operations as appropriate. 
The level of claimed flexibility for each step is fully justified based on the results and analysis of the 
multivariate studies carried out. 
Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development 
is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in a clear and colourless double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) 
plastic bag and tied. The packaged risdiplam is placed in a suitable metal drum. The LDPE bags comply 
with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 Polyolefines and with Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials 
and articles intended to come into contact with food, including subsequent amendments. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (appearance and colour), identity (IR, 
HPLC), polymorphic form (XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (KF), residual 
solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (XRF) and particle size distribution 
(laser diffraction). 
Limits for organic, solvent, elemental and genotoxic impurities have been set in line with ICH Q3A, ICH 
Q3C, ICH Q3D and ICH M7 and are considered adequate considering available batch data. 
The absence of microbiological control of the active substance was satisfactorily justified and is 
considered acceptable on the basis that the finished product is routinely tested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data were provided from 23 batches of the active substance manufactured on scales up 
to full production scale throughout development. The results were within the specifications in place at 
the time of testing. The results from recent production scale batches are consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from five pilot to production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months (4 batches) and 24 
months (1 batch) under long term conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following 
parameters were tested: description, identification of polymorphic form, assay, organic impurities, 
water content, particle size distribution and microbial contamination. The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release and are stability indicating as demonstrated in forced degradation studies. No 
significant changes or trends were observed to any of the tested parameters under long term or 
accelerated conditions on primary stability batches stored up to 18 months (four batches) and 24 
months (one batch). 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Risdiplam is not 
photosensitive in the solid state. Risdiplam in the solid state is also stable to higher temperatures and 
humidity. 
The degradation profile of risdiplam was investigated in aqueous solution when exposed to neutral, 
basic, acidic and oxidative conditions at elevated temperature. Further investigations were carried out 
in the presence of metal ions, a radical initiator (AIBN) and a photosensitizer (Rose Bengal + O2). 
Risdiplam is stable under basic conditions but significant degradation was observed under all other 
conditions. These studies demonstrated the stability indicating nature of the relevant analytical 
methods. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Risdiplam powder for oral solution 0.75 mg/mL is a powder for constitution. Each bottle filled with 
2.0 g of powder contains 60 mg of risdiplam. The powder must be constituted with purified water to 
yield an 80 mL clear oral solution with a concentration of 0.75 mg/mL. The product is available in an 
amber glass bottle with a tamper-evident, child-resistant cap which is accompanied by 1 press-in 
bottle adapter, two 6 mL reusable amber oral syringes and two 12 mL reusable amber oral syringes 
which allow sufficient flexibility and accuracy for the age and weight based posology for patients from 
2 months old up to adults. 
The aim of development was to provide a once-a-day orally available dosage form for treatment of 
spinal muscular atrophy suitable for use in both paediatric and adult patients, potentially with 
swallowing difficulties. The posology is both age and weight dependent and the medicine is intended to 
be given in a home setting by both caregivers and patients. An oral liquid was selected since, in 
Assessment report

combination with the accompanying reusable syringes, this allows sufficient flexibility and ease of 
administration for the intended population and setting. Accordingly, a quality target product profile 
(QTPP) was established, setting the main goals of development. 
The active substance is a stable crystalline solid routinely isolated as form A. It is milled to reduce 
particle size which ensures content uniformity during formulation. It exhibits pH-dependent solubility in 
aqueous media, being most soluble at acidic pH. In solution, risdiplam is sensitive to light and 
oxidation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except for the strawberry flavour whose qualitative composition was provided. Compatibility 
with the active substance was demonstrated through stability studies on binary mixtures. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. No overage is included. 
Palatability was identified as an important element for the acceptability of risdiplam oral solution given 
that it is indicated for paediatric patients. This was assessed in healthy volunteers using a simple 
solution containing no sweetener or flavouring. From the responses, it was concluded that there was 
no pronounced bitterness of risdiplam in the target concentration range. The acceptable taste results 
obtained from this study were taken as a basis to develop the commercial formulation in which both a 
sweetener and strawberry flavour are included. 
Following constitution, the oral solution is a multidose formulation. In order to prevent microbial 
growth and degradation, a preservative (sodium benzoate), an antioxidant (ascorbic acid) and a 
stabiliser (disodium edetate dihydrate) are included in the formulation. The amber bottle provides the 
oral solution with adequate protection from light. According to the guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/QWP/396951/2006 “Guideline on excipients in the dossier for application for marketing 
authorisation of a medicinal product” the inclusion of antimicrobial preservatives or antioxidants should 
be avoided, particularly in the case of paediatric formulations. If unavoidable, the concentration used 
should be at the lowest effective level. For preservatives, the concentration should be justified in terms 
of its safety and efficacy (EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2).  
The concentration of ascorbic acid was demonstrated to be the lowest possible. However, this has not 
been demonstrated for sodium benzoate. Sodium benzoate is a specific issue for very young children 
as it can cause hyperbilirubinaemia and acute bilirubin encephalopathy which may evolve into 
kernicterus (EMA/CHMP/508189/2013). In addition, the combination of benzoate with acid ascorbic can 
produce benzene, a known carcinogen. 
The applicant discussed the balance of using the proposed concentration of sodium benzoate to 
prevent microbial growth against the safety factors in the paediatric population. It was concluded that 
there is no safety risk of including sodium benzoate at the current concentration in the commercial 
finished product formulation, considering the targeted population and the chronic use of the product. 
However, CHMP judged that a lower concentration would have been feasible based on the results of 
the conducted preservative efficacy test study (PET) and raised a major objection as a result. In 
response, the CHMP acknowledged the applicant’s argument that the proposed level of sodium 
benzoate does not pose a safety concern but requested the applicant to commit to conduct a new PET 
study according to Ph. Eur. 5.1.3. The applicant further committed to pursuing development of a new 
formulation containing the lowest feasible level of sodium benzoate if this is supported by the new PET 
study results and to provide information on the resultant development plan if warranted. This 
commitment is included in the recommendations section 2.2.6.

All risdiplam formulations studied during clinical trials and proposed for commercialisation are solution 
formulations. Biopharmaceutical studies investigated the absorption behaviour of risdiplam in adults 
and paediatric subjects with respect to the potential impact of formulation-related factors. Precipitation 
of risdiplam in the human gastrointestinal tract is very unlikely in the therapeutic dose range for adults 
and children. Moreover, changes in formulation composition are not expected to affect the absorption 
behaviour of the compound. Therefore, no bioequivalence studies were conducted between the 
different formulations used in development. 
The development of the risdiplam powder for oral solution followed an enhanced development 
approach that included elements of quality-by-design (QbD). Process development work was 
predicated on risk assessment methodology to identify parameters for investigation by DoE. The 
process consists of conventional pharmaceutical operations such as blending, dry granulation, powder 
filling, and bottle closing, as well as standard equipment. Based on previous experience with similar 
products, the equipment used, and the quality risk assessments, different ranges of parameters (such 
as number of revolutions per blend, roller compaction gap size, force and speed, auger rotation speed) 
were monitored in the different unit operations. Process parameter ranges are considered satisfactory. 
Differences in the manufacturing processes of the commercial product and clinical trial formulations 
were satisfactorily described and discussed. 
The primary packaging is an amber glass bottle with a tamper-evident, child-resistant cap as described 
in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product. The bottle is accompanied by 1 press-in bottle adapter (PIBA), two 6 mL reusable amber 
oral syringes and two 12 mL reusable amber oral syringes which allow accurate weight- and age-based 
dosing. 
During the procedure, a low risk of leakage of the reconstituted product was identified which was 
addressed in the immediate term by inclusion of additional labelling instructions. The applicant 
committed to a thorough review of the container closure system and to conduct new stability studies 
and a new PET study should the container be changed. This commitment is included in the 
recommendations section 2.2.6. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Evrysdi consists of four main steps: pre-blending of risdiplam and 
excipients in fraction A and roller compaction; pre-blending of excipients in fraction B and roller 
compaction; blending of fractions A and B along with strawberry flavouring; packaging. The process is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on 3 consecutive production scale 
batches, with additional testing conducted to evaluate the content uniformity of risdiplam, ascorbic 
acid and sodium benzoate in different granulate fractions. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form including description of container, appearance of bottle contents, appearance, colour and 
pH of reconstituted solution, identification of risdiplam (HPLC, UV), identification of sodium benzoate 
(HPLC), identification of ascorbic acid (HPLC), content of risdiplam per bottle (HPLC), content of 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 21/293 
 
 
sodium benzoate per bottle (HPLC), content of ascorbic acid per bottle (HPLC), degradation products 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass of delivered 
doses (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The limits for impurities are set in line with ICH Q3B. The single impurity specified above the 
qualification threshold has been qualified at the appropriate level in clinical studies. Other parameters 
including limits for preservative and antioxidant are set in line with batch data and pharmacopoeial 
requirements. The justification for not including tests for determination of minimum fill, deliverable 
volume and constitution time in the finished product release and shelf-life specifications is acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
indicated that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. 
Limits for relevant elemental impurities are included in the active substance and excipient release 
specifications. Based on the risk assessment, control strategy for excipients and active substance, and 
batch data it can be concluded that no additional controls in the finished product are needed. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
performed in response to a major objection raised by the CHMP, considering all suspected and actual 
root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on 
the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure 
under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk 
of nitrosamine impurities being present in the finished product and no specific control measures are 
required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 7 pilot to production batches, including the 3 primary stability 
batches, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. All tested parameters were within specifications in place at the time. 
Changes to analytical procedures made during development have been adequately justified. In 
addition, data from 7 batches of a formulation used during clinical development were also submitted 
and were consistent from batch to batch. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under 
a range of long term conditions (5ºC, 25ºC / 60% RH, 30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches 
were identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Samples were tested for the stability indicating parameters as defined in the shelf-life 
specification. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Data from an additional two 
supportive batches (1 pilot scale – 24 months, 1 production scale – 12 months) were also provided. 
The majority of measured parameters remained unchanged throughout the study period under all 
conditions. There was a decrease in risdiplam content and an increase in the specified and total 
impurities, more so at higher temperature and humidity. A downward trend for ascorbic acid content 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 22/293 
 
 
was also observed, more so at higher temperature. Finally, an increase in water was observed at 
higher humidity. Data was extrapolated accordingly to ICH Q3E in order to define an acceptable shelf 
life and suitable storage conditions. Observed physical and chemical changes are not likely to have a 
significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the directions in the 
SmPC. 
A further study investigated the stability of the reconstituted solution. Samples were pulled from the 
primary stability study (samples stored at 5ºC, 25 ºC / 60% RH, 30ºC / 75% RH) at 3-month intervals, 
reconstituted, and stored under refrigerated conditions (5ºC) for up to 64 days. Data is available on 
samples stored for up to 12 months prior to reconstitution. Other than a downward trend in ascorbic 
acid content, no significant trends to any measured parameters relative to the age of powder before 
reconstitution were observed. 
A further study was conducted to evaluate the in-use stability of the reconstituted solution under the 
intended conditions of use. Samples were pulled from the primary stability study (samples stored at 
5ºC, 25ºC / 60% RH, 30ºC / 75% RH) after 6 and 12 months, reconstituted, and stored under 
refrigerated conditions (5ºC) for up to 64 days. Samples were discarded after testing and syringes 
cleaned as per the SmPC instructions. No significant trends to any of the measured parameters were 
observed other than a slight decrease in ascorbic acid content.  
Photostability was assessed on the powder in bottle, the reconstituted solution and the solution in the 
provided amber oral syringes. The samples were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No changes to the powder and 
reconstituted solution were observed indicating that the amber bottle provides adequate protection 
from light. It is recommended that the solution, once withdrawn from the bottle, is administered to the 
patient within 5 minutes. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. The reconstituted oral solution is 
stable for up to 64 days in a refrigerator. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant resolved 
the major objection on sodium benzoate context with arguments that the current concentration 
presents no safety risk and committed to conducting a new PET study according to Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 and 
to pursuing the development of a new formulation containing the lowest feasible level of sodium 
benzoate if this is supported by the new PET study results and to provide information on the resultant 
development plan if warranted. The major objection in relation to potential nitrosamine contamination 
was resolved by submission of a satisfactory risk evaluation.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the 
manufacture of the active substance. The design spaces have been adequately verified.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
●  The MAH should conduct a new PET study according to Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 in order to re-evaluate 
the antimicrobial efficacy of sodium benzoate. The applicant should pursue the development of 
a new formulation containing the lowest feasible level of sodium benzoate if this is supported 
by the new PET study results and to provide information on the resultant development plan if 
warranted. 
●  The MAH should undertake a thorough review of the container closure system and conduct new 
stability studies and a new PET study should the container be changed. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) is an orally administered small molecule SMN2 splicing modifier developed for 
the treatment of SMA. Risdiplam modulates SMN2 splicing to shift the balance from exon 7 exclusion to 
exon 7 inclusion into the mRNA transcript, thereby increasing the production of full-length (FL) SMN 
protein from the SMN2 gene. The resulting increase in functional SMN protein is deemed to 
compensate for the deficit of this protein in SMA patients. 
Primary Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacological activity of risdiplam to modify SMN2 exon 7 splicing and to increase SMN protein 
levels was assessed in a variety of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo model systems. Since humans are the 
only species known to have the SMN2 gene besides the SMN1 gene, the pre-clinical pharmacological 
effects of risdiplam could only have been studied in human cells from SMA patients and in genetically 
modified animal models. In vitro studies on human cells from healthy subjects were also performed in 
order to check for risdiplam selectivity towards SMN2 gene. 
At clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax of 37 nM unbound risdiplam in infants with type 1 SMA 
aged 1-7 months at enrolment), risdiplam efficiently corrected the dysfunctional splicing of the human 
SMN2 pre-mRNA by shifting the alternative splicing reaction towards the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 and 
by inducing gene expression of FL SMN2 mRNA, in cultured Type 1 SMA patient-derived cells (EC50 
11-12 nM and 24-19 nM, respectively); this in turns led to the production of the FL mRNA which 
translated into increased SMN protein levels (EC50 12 nM).  
The effect of risdiplam on cultured Type 1 SMA patient-derived cells was approximately 2-fold less 
potent than in human blood cells from healthy donors, in terms of both gene expression of FL SMN2 
mRNA (EC50 8.25-14.2 nM) and reduced Δ7 mRNA (EC50 6.6-6.7 nM), values normalised for human 
plasma protein binding fraction 11% unbound.  
At clinical Cmax, no effect on FL SMN protein level in motor neurons derived by type 1 SMA patient 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), was achieved (EC50 182 nM). The applicant justified this result 
stating that iPSC motor neuron model would represent an immature neuronal cell type that does not 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 24/293 
 
 
fully recapitulate in vivo motor neuron physiology. Notwithstanding the limitations of this in vitro 
model, iPSCs-differentiated motor neurons still represent a valuable tool for drug screening for SMA 
reflecting the genetic alteration in human SMA. The lack of activity of risdiplam in Type 1 human iPSC-
derived motor neuron should be weighted in the context of overall non-clinical and clinical results. 
Two different SMA mouse models carrying a varying number of the human SMN2 gene copies, were 
used to study the effect of risdiplam on SMN2 pre-mRNA. At clinically relevant plasma concentrations 
(Cmax of 37 nM unbound risdiplam in infants with type 1 SMA aged 1-7 months at enrolment), 
risdiplam was able to restore SMN protein levels in the severe phenotype of the SMA disease model 
(SMNΔ7 young mice reflecting Type 1 SMA-like phenotype) more markedly in brain than in quadriceps 
in terms of ED50 values (brain: 0.172 mg/kg corresponding to unbound plasma level=1.7 nM vs 
quadriceps: approximately 0.3 mg/kg corresponding to unbound plasma level=42 nM, at postnatal day 
7). Risdiplam was able to induce in both brain and quadriceps greater than 2-fold increase of SMN 
protein respect knock out control animals. When compared to the level of SMN protein in HET mice, 
the fold increase of SMN protein was much lower being approx. 50% in brain and quadriceps. Although 
the ideal outcome of a therapy is the complete correction of SMN2 splicing, partial correction can still 
reduce the severity of the disease with a significant significative impact on quality of life of patients 
and caregivers. 
In the milder mice model phenotype (adult C/C mice reflecting a Type 2/3 SMA-like phenotype), 
risdiplam lost potency in increasing FL SMN protein in both brain and quadriceps reaching ED50 values 
(brain: 5.77 mg/kg corresponding to unbound plasma level=149 nM; quadriceps: 10 mg/kg 
corresponding to unbound plasma level = 262 nM) corresponding to plasma levels 3 to 5-fold higher 
the clinical Cmax of 50 nM (unbound risdiplam in patients with Type 2/3 SMA phenotype aged 2-25 
years at enrolment). No adequate discussion was provided by the applicant for this result that remains 
a significantly relevant non-clinical result that informs the clinical data in particular, given that no 
clinical study has included SMA type 4 (adult onset) SMA.  
The applicant stated that the clinical risdiplam target exposure/dose was selected on the basis of in 
vitro and in vivo studies. At least 2-fold increase of plasma SMN protein level versus baseline was the 
clinical benchmark predicted to lead to significant clinical benefit. Since the applicant did not provide 
the baseline SMN levels in the two transgenic SMA mouse models, it is not possible to verify such 
clinical target, However, it is agreed that data from the two mouse SMA models suggest a positive 
correlation between FL SMN protein increases and increase in the brain and quadriceps.  
The resulting increase in SMN protein levels translated into significant efficacy in rescuing disease 
phenotype of Type 1 SMA-like SMN∆7 mice. While vehicle-treated mice developed a severe 
neuromuscular phenotype with a life expectancy of less than 3 weeks, treatment with the most 
efficacious dose of risdiplam from PND3 onwards largely protected both central and peripheral 
phenotypes related to neuromuscular denervation, reduced muscle atrophy, rescued motor function 
and caused a profound prolongation of animal survival beyond 6 months of age. 
Metabolite M1 was identified as a major human metabolite of risdiplam. When tested in fibroblasts, M1 
was less potent, with an EC50 for inducing the generation of FL SMN2 transcript and an IC50 for 
inducing the decrease of exon 7-lacking SMN2 transcript levels, approximately 34 and 28 times higher 
than those for risdiplam, respectively. In whole blood samples from healthy volunteers, no activity was 
observed for M1 up to a concentration of 3 µM.

Secondary Pharmacology 
At therapeutically relevant concentrations, risdiplam modifies alternative splicing rather than gene 
expression in vitro with high specificity for SMN2 and with a few secondary splice targets only, namely 
STRN3 and SLC25A17. At a concentration 5-fold higher than its EC90 (605 nM versus 121 nM), 
risdiplam was shown to significantly influence alternative splicing of only 11 additional genes. 
Of those 13 off-target genes in total, FOXM1 and MADD were identified as likely contributors to 
toxicities seen in studies with animals and in vitro systems, while STRN3, SLC25A17, and APLP2 were 
not considered of relevance for the safety of risdiplam.  The applicant referred to insufficient data to 
characterize the function of different splice variants of STRN3. It is known that STRN3 codes for the 
protein striatin-3, which is involved in several biological processes, including the negative regulation of 
intracellular oestrogen receptor signalling pathway. The same applies for the SLC25A17 gene, which 
codes for Peroxisomal membrane protein PMP34, involved in several biological processes, including 
ATP and fatty acid transport, and in fatty acid oxidation but the roles of different splice variants of this 
gene are not known. Thus, the applicant acknowledges that the biological functions of splice variants of 
STRN3 and SLC25A17 as potentially emerging from treatment with risdiplam are not fully 
characterised. In animal studies, no apparent associations with pathophysiological outcomes were 
found. On the other hand, clinical studies conducted with risdiplam no imbalance in adverse events (in 
particular reproductive system and breast disorders, endocrine disorders) or safety laboratory 
assessments (including cholesterol, triglycerides) was observed. 
Risdiplam and its major human metabolite M1 were tested for off-target activity (including targets 
considered of importance for abuse potential) at a single test concentration of 10 µM in radioligand 
binding and enzymatic assays looking at 101 different binding sites or enzyme targets (radioligand 
binding: 69 human and 13 rat sites; 19 human enzymatic sites). 
Both risdiplam and M1 inhibited cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and 2 (COX2) by >84% (IC50~2 µM) and 
acetylcholinesterase by >77% (IC50~0.6 µM for risdiplam, and ~2 µM for M1) at 10 µM. However, side 
effects known in the context of inhibition of COX1 and COX2 (bleeding, ulceration, erosions in the GI 
tract) have not been observed in animal studies with risdiplam. Similarly, effects known for inhibition 
of acetylcholinesterase (cholinergic effects) have not been seen in the animal safety pharmacology and 
toxicity studies with risdiplam. Risdiplam inhibited radioligand binding at histamine H3 (78%, Ki=1.01 
µM, IC50=4.2 µM) and muscarinic M1 (54%, Ki=5.6 µM, IC50=6.4 µM) receptors. Risdiplam inhibited 
the δ-opioid receptor by 62% in the primary screening assay, whilst a follow-up assay identified only 
35% inhibition at 10 µM. Hence, no IC50 was determined at delta opioid receptors. The free maximal 
plasma concentration at the therapeutic dose / exposure are below 55 ng/mL (assuming ~15% free 
concentration with the maximum observed value of 364 ng/mL total). This is equivalent to 
approximately 0.1 M (the molecular weight of risdiplam is 401) exposure in the circulation. Hence, 
this free drug level in the circulation is approximately 6-fold lower than the lowest 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC50), i.e. that achieved in the acetylcholinesterase assay. Hence, it is unlikely that the 
off targets reported are meaningful in terms of clinical exposure to risdiplam and its metabolite M1.  
Interaction with COX1/COX2 activity is the basis for the primary pharmacological effect of various 
approved drugs and inhibition of COX1/COX2 is not associated with any known or reported abuse 
liability signals. The in vivo toxicity studies carried out with risdiplam in mice, rats, rabbits and 
monkeys have not shown any evidence for effects associated with abuse liabilities. 
The applicant mentioned that functional properties, i.e. agonist or antagonist, were not explored due to 
solubility constraints. Nevertheless, the concentration used in the CRO standard cell-based assays was 
in excess of 10-fold over the clinically relevant exposure conditions.

Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with risdiplam, which is 
considered acceptable. 
Safety Pharmacology 
The in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology study package has not shown any evidence for any 
effects of risdiplam on cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory functions. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical studies on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of risdiplam 
(RO7034067) were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys using primarily the same 
formulation, species and strain as in the nonclinical toxicity studies. In vivo nonclinical pharmacokinetic 
(PK) evaluations were performed following both single administration (intravenous and oral) and 
repeat oral doses of risdiplam mainly in rats and monkeys. A panel of in vitro studies was completed to 
assess plasma protein binding, distribution in blood cells, metabolism, and potential drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs) mediated through cytochromes P450 (CYPs) or transport proteins. 
In vitro results indicated that risdiplam is a highly permeable molecule with no significant active efflux 
by human transport proteins and a low turnover in intestine microsomes. In line with these in vitro 
results, risdiplam is well-absorbed from the GI tract with moderate to high bioavailability in animals. 
Risdiplam half-life is short (~5 h), clearance is low (5-10 mL/min/kg) and volume of distribution of 
risdiplam is moderate (2–3 L/kg) in monkeys and rats. Oral bioavailability was moderate in monkeys 
(mean 42.6%), while in rats it was greater than 100% (mean 116.9%). The applicant justified these 
data above 100% as a consequence of the usual 20% of variation observed in rodent 
pharmacokinetics, taking into consideration the high solubility and permeability observed in PK studies 
and in PBPK modelling for human. No significant sex difference or accumulation over time was 
observed after multiple oral administrations across all nonclinical species and daily doses tested; the 
exposure increased roughly dose proportionally. The pharmacokinetic profile of risdiplam was explored 
in pre- and post-weaning rats from PND4 and compared to adults in single dose PK and toxicity 
studies. Total risdiplam exposure increased relevantly (from PND4 until PND14), likely due to 
accumulation caused by a slower elimination (t½ of 15 and 20 h on PND4 and PND12) and decreased 
thereafter on PND 31 to total AUCs similar to those observed at PND4. Total exposures on PND31 were 
consistent with the exposure from other adult rats. Plasma protein binding of risdiplam is moderate 
(89%) with no significant species differences in adults. 
Age-dependent differences in plasma protein binding and half-life were observed in juvenile rats: pre-
weaning pups showed a higher free fraction and longer half-life of risdiplam in plasma compared to 
post-weaning and adult rats. The observed longer half-life might be due to a not yet fully mature 
clearance mechanism. The lower clearance in the early days of life in rats resulted in a several fold 
higher total exposure and roughly twofold higher unbound total exposure on PND12 compared to 
PND4. The total exposure after further repeated doses on PND31 was similar to PND4, but represented 
only half the unbound exposure on PND4. Risdiplam plasma free fraction in rats showed a strong age 
dependency and high inter
individual variability in juvenile plasma with up to 90% free fraction in 
PND4 rats (versus 16% in adult). In contrast to juvenile animals, the plasma protein binding of 
‑
risdiplam is similar in human blood taken from newborns (cord blood) and from children of various 
ages up to adulthood. 
Risdiplam has been developed to target SMN2 alternative splicing selectively in both the peripheral 
organs and CNS by penetrating the blood-brain barrier. As expected from in vitro data, risdiplam freely 
distributes from the blood into the CNS and multiple tissues in animals and tissue elimination generally 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 27/293 
 
 
follows elimination from plasma. Risdiplam showed high passive permeability, which is important for GI 
absorption and tissue uptake. In rat, the CSF to free plasma partitioning (Kp,uu) was predicted at 0.33 
on the basis of in vitro efflux ratio data from cells expressing rodent Mdr1a. This prediction is in line 
with the observed in vivo Kp,uu of 0.28, confirming Mdr1a as the principal mechanism that lowers 
rodent CSF levels. Still, this property did not limit SMN protein increase in mouse brain. Risdiplam is 
also a strong rodent Bcrp substrate in vitro, but this interaction was not apparent in vivo since rodent 
CSF levels were successfully predicted based on the weak Mdr1a interaction alone. This apparent 
disconnect for brain penetration of rodent Bcrp substrates has also been observed with other 
molecules. These findings are also in alignment with risdiplam high passive permeability (350 nm/s). 
In contrast to rat proteins, risdiplam is not a substrate of human MDR1 and a weak substrate of human 
BCRP. In each of the 3 species studied (mice, rats and monkeys) risdiplam showed elimination kinetics 
from the CNS comparable to that from plasma. Several weeks after the end of treatment risdiplam was 
fully eliminated, with drug levels being below lower limit of quantification in brain, CSF and plasma. 
The free drug hypothesis applies to all tissues and unbound drug in plasma is also expected to be in 
equilibrium with free drug in the muscles. Data have shown that risdiplam distribution to and 
elimination from muscle tissue correlates with plasma levels in mice, rats and monkeys. 
In line with the estimated volume of distribution values in rat and monkey (2–3 L/kg), both the rat 
QWBA and the monkey tissue distribution studies confirmed a wide distribution of risdiplam with tissue 
elimination parallel to elimination from plasma. Risdiplam levels equivalent or higher than the total 
plasma levels in bone, mucosa of the GI tract, pancreas, liver, lung, heart, kidney and spleen were 
therefore confirmed in rodents and non-human primates. Highest risdiplam concentrations in monkeys 
treated orally 3 mg/kg/day for 7 days were reported in duodenum and liver with ca. 33-fold higher 
concentrations compared to plasma, while skin/ and spleen/plasma ratios were 5.51 and 5.21 
respectively. Skin and spleen high distribution was also detected in rats treated with 3 mg/kg/day PO 
for 4 days, with spleen/plasma ratio above 20 in pigmented rats. On the other hand, skin 
concentration of risdiplam was higher in Albino rats than pigmented rats; this result is not consistent 
with the strong melanin-binding of risdiplam observed both in vitro both in ocular tissues. The 
applicant stated to consider these data with caution due to the high inter-individual variability of the 
skin results. Moreover, following oral administration of 14C-risdiplam to Albino and partially pigmented 
rats, higher levels of radioactivity were measured in pigmented skin compared to non-pigmented skin.  
Distribution into melanin-containing parts of the eye (choroid + RPE, iris, sclera) was significantly 
higher than in non-pigmented ocular structures (retina, lens, vitreous body) or the rest of the body 
(muscle, brain, CSF). The higher accumulation in melanin containing tissues is in line with the strong 
melanin binding observed in vitro. The elimination rate in pigmented tissues differed from the rest of 
the body and drug levels were still considerably high in the eye, especially in melanin-containing parts 
in both pigmented rats and monkeys after treatment-free periods. However, a clear decline and 
elimination could be observed. In toxicology studies, retinal degeneration occurred after prolonged 
dosing and whose mechanism is not fully understood. As the applicant reported, risdiplam is light 
sensitive, suggesting that risdiplam and/or M1 metabolite photodegradation products could be toxic to 
eye tissues. Risdiplam was subjected to in vitro phototoxicity evaluation in 3T3 fibroblasts utilizing the 
neutral red uptake assay, showing no phototoxicity. This study implicitly included the evaluation of any 
photodegradation products that were possibly generated from risdiplam under UV exposure conditions 
in the in vitro test. The existing in vitro study for phototoxicity as conducted in compliance with [ICH 
S10] is sufficient to conclude that there is no phototoxicity risk from risdiplam in clinical use. The 
location of the toxicity in the retina periphery is inconsistent with any UV related breakdown of 
risdiplam or its M1 metabolite, as the relevant spectrum of light does not reach the retina, in particular 
not the periphery of the retina. Therefore, the systemic distribution of risdiplam into the retina and its 
action at this site on the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors is not envisaged to be

dependent on UV exposure, and is considered to be associated with risdiplam itself (including any M1) 
but not related to photodegradation. In accordance, in clinical studies with risdiplam, comprehensive 
ophthalmological evaluations, which included examination of all melanin containing eyes structures 
(choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, iris, and sclera), as well as retinal imaging by optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), confirmed the absence of any findings suggestive of phototoxicity reactions in eye 
structures in 465 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treated with risdiplam for up to 3 years 
[Sergott et al. 2020].      
Risdiplam is relatively metabolically stable in vitro and in vivo. The major drug related species in vitro 
and in vivo in rat, monkeys and human is the parent molecule. The N hydroxy metabolite M1 was 
identified in liver microsomes and hepatocyte samples of all species. M1 was identified as human major 
metabolite in healthy volunteers and patients (median M1/parent ratio is 0.287 = ~0.3 in SMA 
patients). Human exposure to M1 was qualified in all key toxicology studies (repeat dose toxicity, 
juvenile toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity) at the respective NOAELs and at 
doses with adverse toxicities in these study types. 
The major excretion pathway in rats is through the faeces while renal excretion does not contribute 
significantly to the clearance of the compound in nonclinical species. The parent molecule constitutes 
most of the drug-related material in plasma and excreta. The most abundant metabolite in plasma, 
M1, is excreted in urine. 
In vitro data have shown that liver is expected to be the main organ of risdiplam metabolic clearance 
and both FMO enzymes and multiple CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4) contribute to risdiplam 
metabolism, mainly generating M1. 
In vitro studies showed that risdiplam and its metabolite M1 did not inhibit (reversible or TDI) any of 
the CYP enzymes tested (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) with the exception of CYP3A4. 
Risdiplam and its major metabolite M1 did not induce any of the CYP enzymes tested (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, and 3A4). Risdiplam and its metabolite M1 did not inhibit any of the transport protein 
tested in vitro (MDR1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OAT3) with the exceptions of BCRP, OCT2, 
MATE1 and MATE2-K. Based on systemic and local concentrations of risdiplam and M1, the only 
potentially clinically relevant transporters-DDI risks expected are linked to MATE1 and MATE2-K 
inhibition by risdiplam. These potential DDIs are reflected in the SmPC. 
Risdiplam human exposure after PO administration in healthy volunteers was originally predicted 
through physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling using Gastro Plus v8.6 software. Both 
PBPK prediction and in vitro efficacy data for risdiplam were used in the PKPD model to predict the full-
length mRNA time course at the intended doses during the Phase I clinical trial. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety profile of risdiplam was assessed in a comprehensive toxicology programme. The 
relevance of the animal models was mainly judged on the basis of secondary mRNA splice targets 
occurring in animals and humans.  
The monkey was considered to be a suitable and translational species for the safety assessment of 
risdiplam for use in humans due to the similar changes in splicing in secondary target genes upon 
treatment with risdiplam, as observed in SMA patient derived fibroblasts, in stimulated monkey and 
human monocytes and iPSCs, and in monkey spleen tissue in vivo. For at least one of the secondary 
splice targets identified for monkey and human cells, FOXM1, species differences exist between the 
primate (monkey and human) and the rat.

Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated single dose toxicity studies were performed. Instead, reference is made to the results of 
studies with short-term treatment duration. This is aligned with the current guidelines. Based on the 
results of studies with a treatment duration of up to 8 days, acute effects of risdiplam may potentially 
include bone marrow toxicity and histological changes in gastrointestinal epithelia, skin, tongue and 
larynx epithelia and germ cell degeneration in testes. However, considering systemic exposures, these 
acute effects observed in the animal studies do not appear to represent a risk to patients at the 
intended therapeutic dose levels. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies included studies in Wistar Hannover rats (adults) and cynomolgus 
monkeys (sexually immature), with administration of risdiplam, by daily oral gavage, during up to 26 
and 39 weeks, respectively. The choice of the animal species was justified based on secondary mRNA 
splice targets and on metabolism. The SMN2 gene is human-specific. 
Studies were also conducted in sexually immature/juvenile rats, in Brown Norway rats, mice and 
rabbits. These are mostly addressed in other sections, as, as applicable, juvenile animal studies, dose 
range-finding studies to carcinogenicity or embryo-foetal developmental studies or other toxicity 
studies. 
Risdiplam-related adverse findings were detected in all repeat dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and 
monkeys. All adverse effects were reversible or partially reversible in nature (depending on the chosen 
reversibility period and cell turnover in the respective organs) excretion given for retinal degeneration 
seen in the 39-week study in monkeys. 
Effects observed in the chronic toxicity study in Wistar Hannover rats, at the maximum tested dose, 
included clinical signs of toxicity such as decreased activity, decrease in body weight gain and in the 
weight of the thymus, testis, epididymis and uterus, and increase in the weight of the adrenal gland. 
There were histopathological changes in the epithelium of the GI tract and hard palate, and acinar cells 
of the pancreas, with single cell necrosis; changes in the testes and epididymis, with 
degeneration/atrophy of seminiferous tubules in the testis and decrease in sperm and minimal 
degeneration/necrosis of ductular epithelium in the epididymis; vaginal changes indicative of a shift 
toward an oestrous cycle arrest; presence of cortical pigmentation and minimal to mild haemorrhage in 
adrenal gland; and thymus with minimal to moderate decreases lymphoid cellularity; and, in males, 
atrophy of mammary gland. A slight reduction of group mean scotopic b-wave amplitudes in females 
was observed at electroretinography, which, however, was considered unlikely to be related to 
treatment. Mortality was observed at the high dose and this was attributed to the risdiplam-related 
marked decreased cellularity of the bone marrow in combination with intestinal tract findings. Findings 
fully and partially recovered after an 8-week recovery period. Based on clinical effects and mortality 
seen at the maximum tested dose (7.5 mg/kg/day) and on the testis findings, the NOAEL for males 
and females were considered to be 1 and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively. At these respective NOAELs, 
systemic exposure (AUC0-24h) to risdiplam in males was identical to the targeted exposure in patients; 
in females, it was approximately 4 times higher. At the maximum tested dose (7.5 mg/kg/day), 
systemic exposure in animals of both sexes was approximately 8 times higher than the targeted 
human exposure. 
Effects observed in the chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys included clinical signs of toxicity 
(shedding/peeling skin at various locations and reddening of the face), decrease in thymus weight, 
retinal degeneration, mainly in the mid to peripheral layer, epidermal hyperplasia in the skin, and 
atrophy in the thymus. Depression of electroretinography amplitudes was also observed. At the end of 
the 22-week recovery phase, retinal degeneration was still observed in animals given the maximum

dose. There were no test item-related findings in the skin and thymus. Based on the findings in the eye 
of animals administered 3 or 7.5/5 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL was considered to be 1.5 mg/kg/day. At the 
NOAEL, systemic exposure (AUC0-24h) to risdiplam in males and females was identical to the targeted 
exposure in patients. At the maximum tested dose (7.5/5 mg/kg/day), systemic exposure was 
approximately 3 times higher than the targeted human exposure.  
Both  in  rats  and  monkeys,  systemic  exposures  (AUC0-24h)  to  risdiplam  were  generally  proportional  to 
dose  and  with  no  major  gender  differences.  None  of  the  samples  from  the  control  groups  contained 
quantifiable plasma concentrations of risdiplam. 
Effects of risdiplam on proliferating cells and tissue, such as effects in male germ cells and 
skin/mucosa, were attributed to alternative splicing of RNA other than SMN2, namely FOXM1, a major 
cell cycle regulating factor, and MADD, a gene with various splice variants involved in apoptosis. All 
these effects were considered of human relevance. 
The mechanism of risdiplam-induced retinal changes, observed in the 39-weeks study in cynomolgus 
monkey was considered to be unknown. No such changes were observed in the 26-weeks study in 
Wistar Hannover (albino) nor in a further 26-week (non-GLP) study in Brown Norway (pigmented) rats, 
despite high tissue accumulation and tissue retention of risdiplam in pigmented rat RPE/retina; only 
minor changes in secondary splice targets, compared to other tissues, were seen in the retina. On the 
other side, a mechanistic study showed impairment of lysosomal function/autophagosomal 
accumulation in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in vitro, with no identical studies 
conducted using rat and monkey RPE cells. In the absence of findings during on-treatment 
ophthalmological monitoring conducted in 386 patients with SMA for up to 3 years, it was considered 
there is evidence of an absence of retinal toxicity associated with risdiplam. 
Discussed in more detail and encompassing results from the different duration toxicological studies, the 
identified target organs were the following:  
Retina 
Multifocal peripheral retina degeneration in the photoreceptor layer with hypertrophic retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) and microcystoid spaces in the inner retinal layers was seen after 39-week 
administration of risdiplam ≥3 mg/kg/day to monkeys. Association was found between structural 
abnormalities in sdOCT, histopathology findings and functional abnormalities in ERG, as animals 
showing the greatest effects by sdOCT grading also had the greatest ERG depression. Progression of 
depressed ERG and microcystoid spaces in the inner nuclear layer (INL) were only seen in animals at 
the high dose (5 mg/kg/day) with an exposure of 5880/6470 ng·h/mL (AUC0-24 in M/F). The only 
effect which did not recovered was the peripheral photoreceptor loss. The presence of flash-evoked 
VEP even at the highest dose, led to the applicant suggestion that risdiplam administration did not 
significantly compromise retinal ganglion cells or their axonal projections to the visual cortex even in 
animals with affected retinal responses. The NOAEL was set at 1.5 mg/kg/day (AUC 1870/2060 ng-
h/mL for males and females, respectively). 
Retinal effects were not seen in the dedicated retinopathy study in pigmented rats treated for up to 26 
weeks with a high dose of either risdiplam or RO6885247.No consistent effect on the ERG was seen, 
albeit on the basis of a high variability in some parameters in the ERG between animals. As pointed out 
by the applicant, systemic exposure in these studies was higher than the exposure that led to retinal 
toxicity in the monkey (AUC0-24 16100/15700 ng·h/mL [M/F] in albino rats, up to 18000 ng·h/mL in 
pigmented rats versus 1870/2060 ng·h/mL [M/F] at NOEL in monkey). 
The data suggest that retinal effects are seen only in monkeys, the exact mechanism for the delayed 
type of retinal toxicity being at present unknown; secondary splice targets are unlikely involved, thus 
indicating a specific biological process in the monkey that leads to retinal damage upon risdiplam 
treatment. These effects have been identified also for another SMN2 splicing modifier, RO6885247 in a 
Assessment report

chronic 39-week toxicity study in the same species, at exposures in excess of those investigated in 
patients (Ratni et al. 2018). That’s the reason why ophthalmology monitoring was implemented in the 
39-week monkey toxicity study with risdiplam as well.  
As explained by the applicant no retinal changes were observed in rats (both albino and pigmented rats) 
despite of high exposure and pronounced melanin binding (see PK section).  
In light of these data, is presently unclear whether the retinal degeneration process translates into 
human risk. Impairment of autophagosomal function has been observed in vitro in human RPEs and, 
as explained by the applicant, this in vitro property of risdiplam is possibly related to the retinal effects 
seen in monkeys. Moreover, no ocular findings have been seen in the clinic (See Clinical AR).   
Male germ cells  
Degeneration of germ cells was observed in monkey and rat testes after treatment with risdiplam. 
In  the  rat  4-week  toxicity  study,  a  minor  and  reversible  increase  in  the  incidence  of  degenerated 
spermatocytes in the testis was present in males given 9 mg/kg/day (AUC 0-24h 15300/17700 ng.h/mL).  
In adult albino rats administered for 26 weeks, testis effects were noted as well. They consisted of 
tubular degeneration/atrophy in testis at 3 and 7.5 mg/kg/day and secondary decreased sperm in the 
epididymis. In addition, one male at the high dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day degeneration/necrosis of the 
ductular epithelium in the epididymis was seen in one male at the high dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day. The 
NOAEL was set at 1 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 of 2200 ng·h/mL). 
This finding was seen also in juvenile animals (see respective section). Decreases in testis and 
epididymis weights were found at ≥1.5 mg/kg/day, which persisted following off-drug period, and 
reversible adverse testicular microscopic changes at 2.5 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for microscopic 
changes in the testis was 1.5 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 1570 ng·h/mL). Male germ cell degeneration was 
also observed in older rats with longer durations of treatment but with higher NOAELs, and in monkeys 
at high exposures (≥12000 ng·h/mL AUC0-24). The difference between younger and older rats in 
terms of total AUC is potentially associated with differences in the plasma free fraction and clearance 
of risdiplam, which result in a higher free plasma exposure in younger as compared to older rats. 
Bone marrow 
In the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in both albino and pigmented rat, a reversible decreased 
cellularity of the bone marrow was recorded at high doses (7.5 mg/kg in albino and pigmented rats, 
albino rats: AUC0-24 16100/15700 ng·h/mL M/F; pigmented rats: AUC0-24 14200 ng·h/mL, M). 
Pronounced decrease in cellularity, in combination with intestinal tract findings, were likely contributing 
to unscheduled deaths and sacrifices. The NOAEL was 1 and 3 mg/kg/day in M and F albino rats, 
respectively (AUC0-24: 2200 ng·h/mL for M; 2400 ng·h/mL for F). The bone marrow was identified as 
a target for toxicity in the bone marrow micronucleus (MN) tests (See Genotoxicity Section).  
GI tract 
Histopathological changes in the GI tract were seen in the non GLP studies in mice, rats and monkeys 
subsequent to oral gavage treatment with risdiplam. These changes included increased 
apoptosis/single cell necrosis in GI, lamina propria vacuolation and single cell necrosis in exocrine 
pancreas epithelia. The changes were fully reversible.  
Skin and larynx  
Skin and larynx were identified as targets for risdiplam toxicity in the repeat dose toxicity studies at 
both 2 and 39 weeks in the monkey, at 6 and 7.5/5 mg/kg/day, respectively. This is consistent with 
similar studies conducted with the SMN2 splice modifier RO6885247 (Ratni et al., 2018). Exposures of 
5880/6470 ng·h/mL (AUC0-24, M/F) at 5 mg/kg/day, were associated with minor changes during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 32/293 
 
 
in-life phase of the study and microscopically. The NOAELs at 2 and 39 weeks were set at 2 and 1.5 
mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 ng.h/mL 2650/2460 and 5880/6470 M/F).  Skin changes fully recovered within 
the 22-week recovery phase in monkeys treated for 39 weeks with the high dose of risdiplam.  
No adverse changes were observed in the skin and larynx of mice, rats and rabbits treated with risdiplam. 
Thymus 
Non-adverse changes in thymus were seen in rats (decreased lymphoid cellularity, reduction of thymus 
weight) and monkeys (atrophy, decreased lymphocyte count) after chronic daily oral treatment with 
risdiplam. These effects were fully reversible.  
Adrenocortical pigmentation 
Risdiplam-related adrenocortical pigmentation was observed with chronic dosing in the rat and was still 
present after the recovery period. No changes to the adrenals were noted in the monkey studies. It is 
assumed that the findings represent age-related changes specific for rat. 
Non-adverse and reversible findings were observed in uterus of female rats after 26 weeks of risdiplam 
treatment, which corresponded to a shift toward dioestrus consistent with an oestrous cycle arrest. 
Mammary gland 
Microscopic changes in the mammary gland were observed in male albino rats at the high dose of 7.5 
mg/kg/day after 26 weeks of treatment. These changes were not observed in pigmented rats in the 
26-week study with similar exposure. Moreover, no effects on the Leydig cells were seen. In light of 
these data and on the reversibility of the effect, reversible, this finding was considered non-adverse. 
No changes in the mammary gland were observed in the monkey chronic toxicity study. 
Safety margins 
An overview of the key toxicities observed in animal studies and their safety margins (or ratios of 
exposure for retinal changes and male germ cell effects) to the mean exposure guidance used in 
clinical trials with SMA patients is provided in a table at the end of this section. 
It has been claimed by the applicant that the identified risks and respective low safety margins may be 
accepted based on the severity of the disease, limited alternative treatment options and lack of an 
increased sensitivity of patients towards the observed animal toxicities. Moreover, key toxicities 
observed in animals were declared to be either monitorable (epithelia, haematology) or could be 
mitigated with imposed contraception requirements (male germ cells, embryofoetal effects) in clinical 
studies. 
Concerning information on repeated dose toxicity studies in the SmPC, the applicant was asked to 
consider to shorten information in section 5.3 and, on the other side, given its onset, irreversibility and 
unclear mechanism, to add  a special warning in relation to the retinal findings in monkeys in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. In response, the applicant considered that inclusion of a warning in relation to the 
retinal findings in section 4.4 is not needed because of the already available clinical data, but has 
introduced revisions into section 5.3, mostly, with deletion of some information. In relation to the lack 
of information on retinal changes in section 4.4, the applicant’s argumentation suggests that the lack 
of an observation of retinal toxicity in patients may have been merely due to a relatively low exposure 
in patients, with effects in monkeys occurring at only slightly higher exposures. From the non-clinical 
point of view, the lack of the mentioned warning is not convincingly justified. This issue is not pursued, 
however, considering that the risk has already been addressed at the clinical level, during the clinical 
trials.

Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of risdiplam was investigated including in vitro studies, a short-term in vivo 
study with additional evaluation of primary DNA-damage by the Comet assay and incorporation of in 
vivo MN tests into repeat dose rat toxicity studies to precisely determine a potential no-effect level for 
systemic exposure.

Risdiplam treatment led to micronuclei induction in vitro in mouse and human cell lines and in vivo in 
rat bone marrow erythroblasts. Risdiplam was not mutagenic in bacterial tests. Beyond induction of 
micronuclei, there was no evidence for primary DNA damage in vivo (in liver or jejunum) following 
treatment with risdiplam, even at doses that clearly raised the frequency of micronucleated cells in the 
bone marrow. The studies consistently supported the statistical assignment of a lower confidence level 
no-genotoxic effect level (NOGEL) for MN induction for risdiplam equivalent to an AUC0-24 of at least 
~3000 ng·h/mL. The NOGEL appeared to increase with duration of dosing; juvenile animals were not 
more sensitive than adult animals.

An indirect mechanism was reasonably suspected to have caused the increases in micronucleated 
erythrocytes. The additional data from the mechanistic investigation indicated a non-DNA target of 
risdiplam and an involvement of apoptosis in the induction of micronuclei in a human cell line (a 
massive increase of PARP upon risdiplam treatment ≥25 µM and suppression of MN induction after 
pretreatment with a pan caspase inhibitor). The mechanism for this not directly DNA targeting effect is 
currently unknown but assumed to be associated with secondary splice targets that interfere with the 
cell cycle control and/or induce apoptotic pathways. Interference of risdiplam with secondary splice 
targets such as FOXM1 and MADD, which interfere with the cell cycle control or induce apoptotic 
pathways, can possibly cause such effects (Costa 2005, Laoukili et al. 2005). 
Consistent with its effects on cell division and apoptosis, risdiplam induced MN in bone marrow as part 
of a non-DNA reactive mechanism. Since the effect is not on the DNA, it could be considered to be 
reversible and damage cannot be passed onto subsequent cell generations. At higher doses, the 
damage manifests as reduction in cellularity in bone marrow, an effect, which is in principle monitored 
in SMA patients with haematology investigation.

Carcinogenicity 
A carcinogenicity study using rasH2 transgenic mice with 6 months duration of treatment did not 
generate any evidence for a tumorigenic potential of risdiplam; there were also no other adverse 
findings in this study . Risdiplam AUC0-24 at the highest dose (9 mg/kg/day) on day 179 was 
15600/11800 ng·h/mL (in M/F), i.e. well in excess of the exposures at which micronucleus induction 
was observed in bone marrow of juvenile and adult rat. The applicant informed that a two-year 
carcinogenicity study in rats is planned to be conducted as a post-approval commitment, in agreement 
with feedback received from CHMP and PDCO. The applicant provided the details of the study and 
proposed timelines for this study that will have to be submitted as a post-approval commitment that 
will need to be fulfilled- this was agreed. Furthermore, it is recommended that lack of complete non-
clinical data on carcinogenicity is considered in the RMP, and that the reference to the ongoing 
carcinogenicity study in rats is clearly presented in SmPC section 5.3.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies comprised studies on embryo-foetal development, 
pre-postnatal development and toxicity upon direct dosing to the offspring (juvenile animal studies). 
No stand-alone fertility studies were conducted. Assessment of potential effects on male and female 
fertility was incorporated in two of the juvenile animal studies, with mating after a recovery period or, 
in the case of a 13-week study in juvenile animals, immediately after the end of the treatment period. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted in Wistar Hannover rats and, in the 
case of embryo-foetal development, also in New Zealand White rabbits. In all studies, risdiplam was 
administered daily by oral gavage.  
Except for 3 non-pivotal studies, all the others were GLP compliant. However, unlike for other GLP-
compliant studies, for the pivotal embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits), no 
information could be located in the “Non-clinical studies GLP compliance” annex to the application 
cover letter included in the initial marketing authorisation application dossier. In response to a request 
for clarification, the applicant has submitted a revised Non-clinical studies GLP compliance” annex. 
According to this, the test facility/test site where the two studies were conducted was part of an EU or 
an OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) accepted GLP Monitoring programme in the period in which 
the test facility/test site was used. 
No adverse effects were observed in male or female fertility. However, it is noted that no studies were 
conducted with concomitant exposure to risdiplam during mating and early embryonic development. In 
response to requests for clarification, the applicant has justified the lack of fertility studies with 
concomitant exposure to risdiplam during mating and early embryonic development because of the 
observation of adverse effects on male sperm cells in rats and monkeys and of teratogenicity in 
rabbits. The justification is accepted. Information on fertility in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC has 
also been revised.  
Furthermore, concerning reversibility of effects on male germ cells, the applicant has revised the text 
of section 5.3 of the SmPC, as requested, and, additionally, also the text of section 4.6. The current 
text proposals are considered adequate.  
Concerning embryo-foetal development, the pivotal study in rats showed reduction in foetal weight 
(−15%) accompanied by an increased incidence of foetuses with morphological variations indicative of 
delayed development. This occurred at a dose level which induced only slight non-adverse maternal 
toxicity. Maternal systemic exposure (AUC0-24h) to risdiplam at the NOAEL for embryofoetal 
development in the rats (3 mg/kg/day [Cmax 319 ng/mL and AUC0-24 4630 ng·h/mL on GD15]) was 
approximately 4.4-times higher than the targeted human exposure of 2000 ng·h/mL. There was no 
Assessment report

Page 35/293 
 
 
evidence of teratogenicity neither in the pivotal study nor in the dose-range finding study. The pivotal 
study in rabbits showed, at the maximum tested dose (12 mg/kg/day), severe maternal toxicity, 
abortions, increased in incidence of late resorptions, and in fetuses with hydrocephaly, absent 
accessory lung lobes or small gallbladder. Maternal systemic exposure (AUC0-24h) to risdiplam at the 
NOAEL for the mothers and embryo-fetal development (4 mg/kg/day [Cmax 1500 ng/mL, AUC0-24 
7990 ng·h/mL on GD15]) was approximately 4.1-times higher than the targeted human exposure.  
Fetal malformations were also observed in the dose-range finding study in pregnant rabbits with 0, 4, 
1 and 5 malformed fetuses in the 0, 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively.  
No adverse maternal or pre-postnatal development effects were observed in the pivotal pre-postnatal 
development study, where maternal systemic exposure at the maximum tested dose (3.0 mg/kg/day) 
was, on average, approximately, 2.7-times higher than the targeted exposure in patients.  Dose-
related increase in the length of gestation and lower live birth index were however observed at ≥ 3 
mg/kg/day in the dose range finding study.  It was considered that this effect could be possibly 
attributed to an inhibition of COX-1 and -2, two potential secondary targets of risdiplam. There were 
no adverse findings on the survival, growth, and development of the offspring (including behavioural 
tests and mating performance). There were no effects on female germ cells, as assessed by primordial 
follicle counts and ovarian histopathology. 
Juvenile animal studies were conducted with administration of risdiplam during up to 4 weeks starting 
at PND4 or during up 13 weeks starting at PND22. 
The dose range finding study in juvenile rats revealed an increased sensitivity to risdiplam treatment in 
pre-weaning rats in comparison to older rats, resulting in high mortality rates observed at doses at or 
above 3.5 mg/kg/day (AUCs around 3000 ng·h/mL or above) within 2 to 7 days of initiation of 
treatment. This were declared by the applicant to be correlated with increased free plasma exposure, 
with pre-weaning pups showing a much higher plasma free fraction and longer half-life of risdiplam in 
plasma than that of post-weaning and adult rats. However, it is unclear if also the toxicity profile of 
risdiplam is different in pre-weaning rats. The mortalities observed in pre-weaning rats in a study were 
considered to be a concern and the applicant was asked to further discuss the cause of the early death 
of pups and the clinical relevance of these findings for the youngest patient population. In response, to 
explain the increased sensitivity to risdiplam treatment in pre-weaning rats in comparison to older rats, 
the applicant referred to the relatively slower elimination and markedly higher free fraction in pre-
weaning rats, and argued that is not aware of any other possible reason. As for the clinical relevance of 
the higher sensitivity in pre-weaning rats, the applicant referred to results from in vitro studies with 
human plasma and to pharmacokinetics and safety data from clinical trials. According to these, 
risdiplam showed similar plasma protein binding in human from birth to adulthood, and risdiplam was 
safe and well tolerated in patients across all age groups. According to the clarifications provided by the 
applicant, the causes of the deaths observed in the DRF finding study were not identified, as no or only 
very limited histopathology could be performed on the decedent neonates. Nevertheless, results from 
the limited histopathology revealed findings (toxicity profile) consistent with findings in the toxicity 
studies in older rats. The increased sensitivity of the neonate rats versus older rats can reasonably be 
attributed to a higher free fraction and longer half-life of risdiplam in pre-weaning rats compared to 
that in older animals. Such higher exposure levels are not relevant for the clinical use of risdiplam in 
the paediatric patient population, where the free fraction is comparable across all ages.  The issue is 
considered without relevance to paediatric patients. 
Due to the different sensitivities, pivotal studies in juvenile rats were divided into two parts: pre-weaning 
and post weaning.  
In the first one (4-week one), treatment with the high dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased 
food consumption and lower body weight gain, which was correlated with reduced long bone growth

and delayed preputial separation in males. In the second one (13-week study), no effects on specific 
parameters of juvenile development were observed up to the highest dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day. Of 
concern. in the 4-week juvenile rat study , minimal to mild nephroblastomatosis (a pre-neoplastic 
lesion) was observed in all test-item treated groups; one male at 0.75 mg/kg/day (low dose) and one 
male and one female at 1.5 mg/kg/day (intermediate dose), and two females at 2.5 mg/kg/day (high 
dose). After the 8-week recovery period, malignant nephroblastoma were present in the kidney of one 
female each at 1.5 mg/kg/day and 2.5 mg/kg/day. In the 13-week study , a malignant 
nephroblastoma was observed in one male at 7.5 mg/kg/day (high dose). The study reports concluded 
these findings as spontaneous in origin. However, as rat kidney neoplasms are uncommon and given 
the high risdiplam distribution to kidney and that the findings were only observed in risdiplam-treated 
animals, the applicant was asked to provide a further discussion on the relation to treatment and 
clinical relevance of these findings.  
In response, the applicant has claimed that the cause of the observed increased incidence of 
nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma in the two studies is a genetic predisposition in the breeding 
generation used to breed the animals included in these studies. Based on the location of the lesions, 
indicating an embryonal origin, and their low incidence, the lesions were interpreted to be spontaneous 
in origin. Furthermore, risdiplam does not display properties that could induce mutations or genetic 
changes in genes driving the development of nephroblastomatosis. 
Nevertheless, the provided historical control data from the Contract Research Organisation shows a 
relatively low incidence of nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma:  among males, one out of 457 
animals with malignant nephroblastoma and, among females, 3 out of 335 animals with 
nephroblastomatosis.  In this respect, the applicant argues that information from breeders, which is 
not available, would be more relevant than historical controls from the respective CRO.  
As for the lack of properties that could induce mutations in genes driving the development of 
nephroblastomatosis, there is reference to 3 key genes highly associated with nephroblastoma (WT1, 
CTNNB1, and WTX) and to the results of the genotoxicity assays.  
The applicant has provided further clarifications on the significance of the nephroblastomatosis and 
nephroblastoma observed in two juvenile rat studies ( [a 4-week study with treatment during PND4-31 
and a 13-week study with treatment during PND22-112, respectively]). 
According to the response, the 13-week study showed no evidence of effect, based on incidence. This 
study showed no nephroblastomatosis and the incidence of nephroblastoma (one male at 7.5 
mg/kg/day) was in line with the historical control data. 
As for the 4-week study, this showed incidences of nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma above      
the historical control data provided by the CRO. However, the same was not observed in a previous 4-
week study with a comparable study design (only 2 dose groups instead of 3, but same size of groups) 
using similar dosage in Wistar rats dosed from PND4 to 31. Furthermore, there is no indication for that 
risdiplam could affect genes mentioned as important in the context of nephroblastoma.  
The applicant considers that there is no need for further amendments to section 5.3 of the SmPC and 
this is accepted. It may be concluded that the increased incidence of nephroblastomatosis and 
nephroblastoma observed in a 4-week study in juvenile rats does not represent a risk to patients. This 
finding was not reproduced in another study with identical study design. Furthermore, knowledge on 
the development of nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma, key genes known to be associated with 
development of nephroblastoma and evidence for lack of effects of risdiplam on these genes does not 
indicate that exposure to risdiplam may lead to the development of nephroblastomatosis and/or 
nephroblastoma. 
As for adult animals, margins of exposures at the respective NOAEL were low to null.

Other toxicity studies 
Risdiplam and RO6885247 have been tested on a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE19) 
for functional impairment . Treatment of cells for 24 h and longer revealed an increase in lysosomal 
mass at non-cytotoxic concentrations (with maximal effects at 3.13 and 6.25 μg/mL) indicative of 
impairment of lysosomal function. The phototoxic potential of risdiplam is considered by the applicant 
to be low. The UV absorption spectrum for the major human metabolite M1 is almost identical with the 
spectrum of risdiplam. Thus, M1 was not tested for phototoxicity because no change in a risk for 
phototoxicity would be expected from human exposure to M1 as compared to risdiplam itself. No 
impact of the UV absorption potential on the retinal toxicity of risdiplam is expected, because the 
retina is not exposed to wavelengths shorter than ~400 nm. No phototoxic potential of risdiplam is 
expected in the visible range above 400 nm. Risdiplam did not elicit any irritative or sensitisation effect 
in an LLNA assay. Nevertheless, the phototoxic properties of risdiplam should be further discussed. 
Risdiplam absorbs light between 240 and 400 nM with an absorbance maximum at 290 nm with a MEC 
value of 13417.8 Lmol-1/cm which is greater than the threshold of 1000 Lmol-1/cm. Further, risdiplam 
binds melanin with high affinity and distributes to and accumulates in melanin-containing parts of the 
eye (choroid and RPE, iris, sclera) of pigmented rats and monkeys with a slow elimination (up to 65 
days). In the 3T3 test using an UVA light source (315-690 nm), risdiplam was concluded as non-
phototoxic up to the limit of solubility (9 µg/mL). However, in human-derived epidermal keratinocytes, 
UVA irradiation (“artificial sunlight”) affected cell viability and triggered release of IL-1, IL-8 and TNFα 
in risdiplam-treated cells at lower concentrations than that tested in the 3T3 study (0.1 to 3 µg/mL) 
and risdiplam was concluded as phototoxic. 
Risdiplam and RO6885247 have been tested on a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE19) 
for functional impairment. Treatment of cells for 24 h and longer revealed an increase in lysosomal 
mass at non-cytotoxic concentrations (with maximal effects at 3.13 and 6.25 µg/mL) indicative of 
impairment of lysosomal function, whereas phagocytosis and oxidative stress levels of ARPE19 cells 
remained unchanged at this time point. Accumulation of autophagosomes involved in clearing 
damaged organelles was also shown for both compounds with 48 h of treatment. It remains unclear 
how these in vitro short-term changes relate to delayed retinal toxicity seen in vivo mechanistically. 
As part of an interspecies safety assessment, four SMN2 splicing modifiers including risdiplam were 
tested in vitro for their concentration-effect relation on RNA markers (FOXM1B/C transcript variants) 
for off-target splicing effects (i.e., secondary pharmacology) in human and Cynomolgus monkey iPSCs 
. As these markers translate into the FOXM1 transcription factor, all four compounds were also tested 
for their impact on cell cycle progression. Treatment with the test items for 24 h from 0.64 nM to 10 
µM revealed comparable IC50 values between human and Cynomolgus monkey cells with respect to the 
down-regulation of FOXM1B/C transcript variants . In this regard, RO6885241 (the metabolite M1 of 
RO6885247) and risdiplam were more potent than RO6885247, whereas the major metabolite of 
risdiplam, M1 did not appear to affect the expression levels of the FOXM1B/C transcript variants. 
Furthermore, a concentration-dependent effect to induce mitotic arrest in Cynomolgus monkey and 
human iPSCs was detected for RO6885247, RO6885241 and risdiplam, but not for risdiplam M1. 
In vitro studies that were conducted with a series of SMN2 splicing modifiers, which included risdiplam, 
suggested that a distinct number of gene transcripts could be affected by alternative splicing  (see also 
Palacino et al. 2015). To contribute to mechanistic understanding of toxicities provoked by treatment 
with risdiplam, RNA sequencing analyses followed by detailed analysis of spliced genes were integrated 
into the 2-week dose-range finding repeat dose toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey. 
Gene expression analysis was performed in spleen, duodenum, and testis in rats treated for 2 weeks 
with a focus on the genes, the splicing of which were most affected in vitro and with previously tested

compounds, i.e. Madd, Strn3, Aplp2, Smn1 and Foxm1 genes [Ratni et al. 2018]. Gene expression 
analysis of risdiplam-treated animals revealed a splicing response at the highest dose of 
7.5 mg/kg/day for Madd and Strn3 gene transcripts and to lower extent for the Aplp2 gene transcript 
in spleen, duodenum, and testis. Aplp2 was not seen as a major secondary splice target in the in vitro 
pharmacology studies but surfaced as more affected in these in vivo studies in rats and monkeys at 
the high doses at which these were conducted. Transcripts of the Smn1 and Foxm1 genes remained 
unchanged in alternative splicing. Similar investigations were integrated into the 2-week dose-range 
finding toxicity study conducted in the Cynomolgus monkey with risdiplam. Spleen, duodenum, and 
testis were analyzed from the animals treated with 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg/kg/day. The analysis with 
mRNA isoform specific qPCR assays revealed a secondary pharmacological response to risdiplam 
treatment at the highest dose for the transcripts of the MADD and STRN3 genes, and to a lower extent 
for the APLP2 gene transcript in all three organs. The transcript variants FOXM1B/C of the FoxM1 gene 
showed a down-regulation in testis in one animal at the highest dose. Transcripts of the SMN1 genes 
remained unchanged in alternative splicing in response to treatments. Since secondary 
pharmacological response was detected in spleen, this organ was further analyzed for transcriptome-
wide mRNA splicing or expression changes by RNA-sequencing. This analysis revealed that, except for 
the above-mentioned spliced transcripts, the vast majority of mRNAs exhibited either no change in 
alternative splicing or no dose-dependent trend in such changes upon treatment with risdiplam. 
Furthermore, a dose-dependent trend for pathway expression changes was not detected in the RNA 
sequence and pathway analyses. 
Splicing analyses for the retina and choroid/RPE were also integrated into a monkey multiple dose PK 
study with risdiplam and another SMN2 splice modifier, RO6885247 administered at 3 mg/kg/day over 
7 days. Splice variants of the main secondary splice targets FOXM1, STRN3, APLP2, and MADD were 
examined. In contrast to spleen and skin samples, splice variant changes were detected in the retina 
and choroid/RPE only for APLP2 and STRN3 and these changes were clearly weaker than in spleen and 
skin. Both compounds showed consistent results in this analysis. Splicing changes have returned to 
control conditions when measured after 6 weeks of recovery. Similar observations were made in a 
study conducted with albino and pigmented rats. 
A local lymph node assay was conducted in the mouse to assess skin irritation (erythema) and 
sensitisation after epidermal (to the ears) or oral induction exposures. In this study, risdiplam did not 
elicit any irritative or sensitisation effect.

2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
EVRYSDI was submitted as an orphan medicinal product - Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, being the active substance risdiplam. 
An experimental log Kow value for the PBT screening has not been provided. The PBT assessment 
cannot be finalised and the applicant should experimentally determine the log Kow as a function of pH 
covering an environmentally relevant pH-range and calculate the ion-corrected log Dow. 
The applicant highlighted that the logDOW values obtained by the HPLC method were confirmed with 
the pH-metric method as well as QSAR. Nevertheless, the shake-flask test according to OECD 107 is 
commissioned to Arcadis (Schweiz) Ltd, to perform logDOW values at pH 5, 7, and 9 in compliance 
with GLP. The results will be available by the end of April 2021.  
The assessor acknowledges the accomplishment of the shake-flask test according to OECD 107 that 
will be available by the end of April 2021. However, the results of such test must be shared with the 
CHMP since they should be assessed and the EPAR updated. Therefore, the applicant must commit to 
submitting the results of the shake-flask test by the end of April 2021. 
Phase I calculations result in a refined PECsw of 0.0009 μg/l based on a prevalence study from Italy 
and can be accepted.

Phase II has been included as complementary data to estimate the environmental risks. The provided 
acute-based surface water PNECs are not acceptable. Despite these weaknesses, it is considered that 
due to the calculated low environmental exposure risdiplam unlikely represents a risk. However, the 
log Kow values were calculated using the HPLC method that covers log Kow(s) in the range of 0-6 and 
may not reliable enough for risdiplam, therefore the applicant should confirm /discuss if both results 
calculated by HPLC method and experimentally determined by the Shake-Flask method will be similar. 
Risdiplam is not readily biodegradable. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder secondary to loss-of-function 
mutations in both alleles of the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene with subsequent loss of SMN 
protein expression. In humans, there are two SMN genes, the SMN1 gene and its paralog SMN2. The 
SMN2 pre messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) undergoes alternative splicing that excludes exon 7 from 
85%–90% of mature SMN2 transcripts, which produces an unstable SMNΔ7 protein that is rapidly 
degraded. So that, full-length SMN2 mRNA is generated in only 10%–15% of splicing events. 
Risdiplam is an orally administered small molecule SMN2 splicing modifier developed for the treatment 
of SMA. Risdiplam modulates SMN2 splicing to shift the balance from exon 7 exclusion to exon 7 
inclusion into the mRNA transcript, thereby increasing the expression of full-length SMN protein from 
the SMN2 gene in a dose dependent manner. The resulting increase in functional SMN protein is 
deemed to compensate for the deficit of this protein in SMA patients 
A comprehensive nonclinical testing programme, consistent with ICH guidelines and performed in 
relevant in vitro and animal models, was designed to characterize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
/ toxicokinetics, and toxicology of risdiplam. In the toxicity studies, risdiplam was administered orally 
as per the intended clinical route of administration (except for the dermal local lymph node assay 
[LLNA] assay). However, in the transgenic mouse model to study efficacy of risdiplam, the 
intraperitoneal route of dosing was used for very young mice due to their susceptibility to the stress of 
oral dosing. Intravenous administration was used in some pharmacokinetics studies (e.g., to judge 
absolute bioavailability). 
The pharmacological effects and specificity of risdiplam were investigated in pharmacology studies 
conducted in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. 
The in vitro and ex vivo pharmacological studies evaluated the efficacy of risdiplam to induce SMN2 
exon 7 inclusion to produce the full-length SMN2 transcript and the resulting translation into increased 
SMN protein levels. These analyses were conducted with Type 1 SMA patient fibroblasts, in cultured 
motor neurons derived from Type 1 SMA patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and in whole 
blood from healthy volunteers. The effect of risdiplam major human metabolite M1 on SMN2 transcript 
splicing was assessed in Type 1 SMA patient-derived fibroblasts and whole blood from healthy 
volunteers. 
In Type 1 SMA patient fibroblasts, risdiplam resulted 2-fold more active in correcting alternative 
splicing (i.e., reducing Δ7 mRNA) than in increasing functional gene expression (i.e., increasing FL 
mRNA). EC50 values (target effect) for both endpoints were below the clinical Cmax of 37 nM unbound 
risdiplam in infants with Type 1 SMA aged 1-7 months at enrolment, while EC100 was 3-fold higher the 
same clinical Cmax. It appears that in terms of EC50 values the ability of risdiplam to increase FL SMN 
protein production (EC50 12 nM), correlates better with reduction of SMN2 Δ7 mRNA (EC50 11-12 nM) 
rather than with the increase of FL SMN2 mRNA (EC50 24-29 nM). This is in line with data from clinical 
PD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 41/293 
 
 
On the contrary, no effect on SMN protein level in motor neurons derived by Type 1 SMA patient 
induced pluripotent stem cells, was achieved at clinical Cmax of 37 nM unbound risdiplam in infants 
with Type 1 SMA (EC50 182 nM). Traditionally, it is unfeasible to obtain patient-originated and SMA-
related motor neuron samples, therefore motor neurons derived by Type 1 SMA patient induced 
pluripotent stem cells still represent a valuable tool for drug screening for SMA reflecting the genetic 
alteration in human SMA. The lack of activity of risdiplam in Type 1 human iPSC-derived motor neuron 
should be weighted in the context of overall non-clinical and clinical results. 
In whole blood from healthy donors, risdiplam was equally able to reduce Δ7 mRNA and increase FL 
SMN2 mRNA expression, however, it was approximately 2-fold more potent than in Type 1 SMA patient 
fibroblasts in increasing FL SMN2 mRNA (EC50 8.25-14.2 nM) and reducing Δ7 mRNA (EC50 6.6-6.7 
nM) (EC50 values normalised for human plasma protein binding fraction, 11% unbound).  
Metabolite M1 (RO7112063) was approx. 30-fold less potent than risdiplam in Type 1 SMA patient 
fibroblasts for reducing Δ7 mRNA and increasing FL mRNA, and approx. 15 to 30-fold less potent than 
risdiplam in whole blood from healthy donors for both endpoints, with EC50 values exceeding the 
clinical Cmax. In whole blood from healthy donors neither risdiplam or metabolite M1 did change the 
SMN1 splicing, showing selectivity towards the SMN2 gene. 
Overall, in severe SMA phenotype with transgenic animal models knock-out for SMN1 gene and 
possessing two copies of the human SMN2 gene, risdiplam showed to correct dysfunctional splicing of 
SMN2 gene being able to restore (doubled) SMN protein level respect control animals, in brain and 
quadriceps, although this increase did not reach the SMN level expressed in healthy animals. Risdiplam 
was more potent in increasing SMN protein level in brain than in quadriceps. The effects were observed 
at clinically relevant Cmax of 37 nM. 
On the contrary, risdiplam lacked activity (in terms of ED50 for increase FL SMA protein in brain and 
quadriceps) in the milder phenotype mouse model (adult C/C mice reflecting a mild phenotype) 
achieving mouse plasma levels 3 to 5-fold higher the clinical Cmax of 50 nM (Firefish clinical study). 
This non-clinical result remains a significantly relevant nonclinical aspect in particular given that no 
clinical study has included SMA type 4 (adult onset) SMA (see clinical efficacy).  
Based on the low potency observed in in vitro studies, no effect of the M1 metabolite was tested in 
vivo. 
Although it was not possible to determine whether the clinical risdiplam benchmark exposure/dose to 
predict significant clinical benefit (e.g. at least 2-fold increase of plasma SMN protein level versus 
baseline) was achieved in non-clinical models, data from the two mouse SMA models suggest a 
positive correlation between FL SMN protein increases in blood and increase in the brain and 
quadriceps. Nevertheless, it is noted that although in clinical PD studies risdiplam increases 2-2.5 fold 
the SMN protein plasma level, no evidence of correlation between PD biomarker and clinical effect has 
been observed.  
At the highest effective dose of 1 mg/kg (plasma level 21 nM) administered from postnatal day (PND) 
3 to PND24 followed by 3 mg/kg (plasma level 56 nM) up to day 220, the percent survivals at PND60 
and 220, were 82% and 36% vs 0 in vehicle treated mice (all vehicle-treated mice died before day 
21). In this treatment group, the median survival time day was 201 vs 10.5 vehicle treated mice. 
However, the major contribution to overall survival in this treatment group, comes from the higher 
supratherapeutic dose of 3 mg/kg administered from post-natal day 24 onwards.

Improvements in secondary phenotypes such as motor behaviour (righting reflex) in young mice at 
PND16, or tissue necrosis (tail and eye) in adult mice at PND220 was observed from the dose range 1 
mg/kg IP → 3 mg/kg PO. In this treatment group treatment with risdiplam: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
reduced  the  loss  of  vGLUT1  synapses  in  L3-5  motoneurons  in  adult  mice;  the  effect  was  nearly 
normalised to heterozygous;  
reduced the loss of the number of L4 ventral root axons even if the effect was not normalised to 
HET;  
reduced the loss of weight of extensor digitorum longus muscle reaching normalisation to HET; 
fully  restored  the  denervation  of  neuromuscular  junction  in  longissimus  muscle  reaching 
normalisation to HET. 
The secondary pharmacodynamic studies evaluated the effects of risdiplam on off-target 
receptors, enzymes and channels and on potential splice targets other than SMN2 in the global 
transcriptome of Type 1 SMA patient-derived fibroblasts. A global transcriptome analysis of alternative 
splice sites and specific splice site analysis of identified secondary splice target genes after treatment 
with risdiplam (and with other SMN2 splice modifiers as discussed in Ratni et al. 2018) was also 
studied in other cell types and in tissue material from toxicity studies in animals. Of those 13 off-target 
genes in total, FOXM1 and MADD were identified as likely contributors to toxicities seen in studies with 
animals and in vitro systems, while STRN3, SLC25A17, and APLP2 were not considered of relevance for 
the safety of risdiplam The applicant referred to insufficient data to characterize the function of 
different splice variants of STRN3. It is known that STRN3 codes for the protein striatin-3, which is 
involved in several biological processes, including the negative regulation of intracellular oestrogen 
receptor signalling pathway. The same applies for the SLC25A17 gene, which codes for Peroxisomal 
membrane protein PMP34, involved in several biological processes, including ATP and fatty acid 
transport, and in fatty acid oxidation but the roles of different splice variants of this gene are not 
known. Thus, the applicant acknowledges that the biological functions of splice variants of STRN3 and 
SLC25A17 as potentially emerging from treatment with risdiplam are not fully characterised. In animal 
studies, no apparent associations with pathophysiological outcomes were found... On the other hand, 
clinical studies conducted with risdiplam no imbalance in adverse events (in particular reproductive 
system and breast disorders, endocrine disorders) or safety laboratory assessments (including 
cholesterol, triglycerides) was observed.  
The in vivo toxicity studies carried out with risdiplam in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys have not 
shown any evidence for effects associated with abuse liabilities. The applicant mentioned that 
functional properties, i.e., agonist or antagonist, were not explored due to solubility constraints. 
Nevertheless, the concentration used in the CRO standard cell-based assays was in excess of 10-fold 
over the clinically relevant exposure conditions. 
Safety Pharmacology 
The in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology study package has not shown any evidence for any 
effects of risdiplam on cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory functions. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical studies on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of risdiplam were 
conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys using primarily the same formulation, species and strain 
as in the nonclinical toxicity studies. In vivo nonclinical pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed 
following both single administration (intravenous and oral) and repeat oral doses of risdiplam mainly in 
rats and monkeys. A panel of in vitro studies was completed to assess plasma protein binding, 
distribution in blood cells, metabolism, and potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) mediated through 
cytochromes P450 or transport proteins.

(mouse, rabbit, rat, Cynomolgus monkey) and in samples from in vitro studies (including human 
matrices) were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For TK 
measurements, LC-MS/MS methods used for the determination of risdiplam concentrations in mouse, 
rat, rabbit, and Cynomolgus monkey plasma and in Cynomolgus monkey CSF were adequately 
validated. Acceptable linearity, precision, accuracy and specificity of test items were observed over a 
range of 0.5 to 2500 ng/mL in plasma or 0.100 to 100 ng/mL in monkey CSF. 
Absorption 
Absorption parameters were determined both in vitro and in vivo in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. 
In vitro studies have been performed in LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells.  
Even if, according with ICH M9 guideline and Q&A, permeability should be assessed by validated and 
standardised in vitro methods using Caco-2 cells, the method used is considered acceptable. Those 
methods are also endorsed by FDA guidance “In Vitro Metabolism- and Transporter- Mediated Drug-
Drug Interaction Studies”. 
Both risdiplam and M1 were found to be highly permeable compounds, with an average passive 
permeability in parental LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells above 300 nm/s. 
After IV administration of risdiplam to adult rats and monkeys, half-life was short (up to 5 h), 
clearance was low (up to 9 mL/min/kg) and volume of distribution of risdiplam was moderate (3 and 2 
L/Kg in rats and monkeys, respectively).   
After single PO administration risdiplam was rapidly absorbed, with tmax values ranged from 1 to 3 
hours in all adult animal species. Half-life was longer and tmax delayed in young pups (PND4 and 
PND12 rats) compared to older rats. Oral bioavailability was moderate in monkeys (mean 42.6%), 
while in rats it was greater than 100% (mean 116.9%). The applicant justified these data above 100% 
as a consequence of the usual 20% of variation observed in rodent pharmacokinetics, taking into 
consideration the high solubility and permeability observed in PK studies and in PKPD. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding was moderate for both risdiplam and M1 with average fraction unbound values 
of 11% and 7.4 % in human, 10% and 13.4% in mouse, 16% and 8.9% in rat, 15% and 11.2% in 
monkey and 10% and 7.5% in rabbit, respectively.  
Risdiplam free fraction showed a markedly age dependency and inter-individual variability in juvenile 
rats while age dependency was less pronounced in mice and monkeys and no differences in plasma 
protein binding were observed for human from birth to adulthood. 
In isolated human plasma proteins, albumin resulted to be the main binding protein for risdiplam, 
which showed a fraction unbound of 12%, while the blood plasma partitioning ratio was close to 1 in 
human, monkey and rat.  
Risdiplam melanin binding was very strong, with average fraction unbound values lower than 0.1% at 
1 μM and 0.2% at 10 μM. On the contrary, risdiplam did not show interaction with human OATP 
transporters; therefore, hepatic uptake should likely to be driven predominantly by passive diffusion, 
which is consistent with the high passive permeability observed in LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells 
(Papp>300 nm/s).

Highest risdiplam concentrations in monkeys treated orally 3 mg/kg/day for 7 days were reported in 
duodenum and liver with ca. 33-fold higher concentrations compared to plasma, while skin/ and 
spleen/plasma ratios were 5.51 and 5.21 respectively. Skin and spleen high distribution was also 
detected in rats treated with 3 mg/kg/day PO for 4 days, with spleen/plasma ratio above 20 in 
pigmented rats. On the other hand, skin concentration of risdiplam was higher in Albino rats than 
pigmented rats; this result is not consistent with the strong melanin-binding of risdiplam observed 
both in vitro both in ocular tissues. The applicant stated to consider these data with caution due to the 
high inter-individual variability of the skin results. Moreover, following oral administration of 14C-
risdiplam to Albino and partially pigmented rats, higher levels of radioactivity were measured in 
pigmented skin compared to non-pigmented skin. Although the applicant did not adequately justify 
these inconsistent results, no skin findings have been observed in toxicology studies in rats. 
In line with melanin binding in vitro data, risdiplam distribution into melanin-containing parts of the 
eye of pigmented rats and monkeys was significantly higher than in non-pigmented ocular structures 
or the rest of the body (muscle, brain, CSF). Moreover, as expected, risdiplam distributed better in 
ocular tissues of pigmented rats than in Albino rats: Choroid+RPE/plasma ratio was 5220 and 0.80 in 
pigmented and Albino rats respectively. In addition, risdiplam decrease was very slow in those tissues, 
up to 65 days for Choroid+RPE.  
In monkeys, mean tissue concentrations from 2h to 6 weeks post last dose (1008h) generally 
decreased, less pronounced in iris, lens, cornea, choroid+RPE, sclera and retina (up to 5-fold decrease) 
and more pronounced in vitreous humour/body (ca. 30-fold decrease) and aqueous humour 
(concentration <0.500 ng/g at 6 weeks post-last dose). 
Risdiplam penetrates into the CNS, with the maximum concentration reached within 1 hour in mice and 
rats. Risdiplam concentration in brain tissue reflected approximately those of total plasma level: brain-
to-plasma AUC ratio was 0.75 in mice following single oral dose of 10 mg/kg risdiplam, 1 in monkeys 
treated orally with 3 mg/kg/day for 7 days, and 1.02 and 1.52 following 4-days 3 mg/kg/day PO 
administration to Albino and Pigmented rats respectively. These results are consistent with high 
permeability and lack of interaction of risdiplam with MDR1 protein. However, risdiplam concentration 
was found to be below in CSF (Cynomolgus monkeys) and in muscle (rats and monkeys) than in 
plasma. 
Drug levels decreased rapidly after the end of treatment in all animals studied, confirming the lack 
tissue accumulation, except for melanin-containing tissues (e.g., up to 65 days in Choroid+RPE tissues 
in rats). 
14C- risdiplam crossed the placental barrier in pregnant rat, with radioactivity levels below the limit of 
quantification in the foetus within 72 h. 
Metabolism 
Risdiplam was relatively stable in incubations with human liver microsomes and hepatocytes, with 
≥89% and ≥98% of parent drug recovered unchanged after incubation, respectively; same results 
have been seen in animals, with unchanged drug accounting for 73% and 86% (rat), 71% and 88% 
(monkey), 82% and 84% (mouse) and 73% and 80% (rabbit) of the drug-related material after 
incubation in liver microsomes and hepatocytes, respectively.  
The main organ of biotransformation for risdiplam is represented by liver, but also kidney and intestine 
can metabolize 14C-risdiplam: drug’s turnover was greatest in liver (24%) then kidney (9%), then 
intestine (2%) after incubation with human hepatic, renal and intestinal microsomes.

The N-hydroxy metabolite M1 was identified as the main one, since it was retrieved in liver 
microsomes and hepatocyte of all species and represents the major circulating metabolite in both 
human and animal plasma.  
The enzymes involved in human metabolism of risdiplam are FMO1 and FMO3 and multiple members of 
the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP). Incubation of unlabelled and 14C-risdiplam with solutions 
containing CYPs and FMO enzymes showed that multiple oxidative metabolism products were 
generated by each of the enzymes. In particular, M1 can be generated by both FMO1 and FMO3 as well 
as CYPs, mainly 3A4/5: the turnover produced by the recombinantly expressed FMO enzymes was 
considerably higher (>60%) than that of the CYP enzymes (<10%). This result was also confirmed by 
incubation of risdiplam with FMOs and CYPs in presence and absence of the respective inhibitors: the 
most effect was obtained with the CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ketoconazole and with the FMO inhibitor 
methimazole, that caused 62% and 46% inhibition when incubated with risdiplam 1 μM, respectively. 
Risdiplam was identified as the major drug-related component (≥88%) in adult and juvenile rat plasma 
collected following multiple oral administration at 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively. Also in 
monkeys, parent drug accounted for ≥ 84% of the identified drug-related material in plasma samples 
following multiple oral administration of risdiplam at 6 mg/kg.  
Single oral (5 mg/kg) and IV (2 mg/kg) administration of 14C-risdiplam to naïve rats confirmed the 
higher concentration of unchanged drug than the other metabolites. 
In line with in vitro results, M1 metabolite has been identified as the major one in all the studies 
previously reported. However, as stated by the applicant, these data could not be used to assess M1 
levels due to oxidative degradation under the plasma sample storage and analysis conditions used 
initially for risdiplam. Therefore, dedicated bioanalytical methods, which involved an addition of a 
stabilizer (L-ascorbic acid) to the plasma samples and handling of the samples under cold conditions 
(nominal 4°C), were developed to overcome the instability of M1. These methods were used 
throughout the bioanalytical workflows in studies started after February 2017. 
Therefore, in order to better characterize risdiplam PK and the formation of M1 metabolite, the 
applicant performed pharmacokinetics bridging studies with a single administration in rats and 3 days 
repeat-dosing in monkeys, in which plasma samples were correctly stabilised. M1 has also been 
monitored in the animal toxicity studies conducted after February 2017 in rats (embryofoetal and pre- 
and postnatal development, juvenile toxicity), mice (carcinogenicity) and rabbit (embryofoetal 
development). Those studies confirm M1 as the main metabolite. 
Following single oral administration of 3 mg/kg risdiplam to Wistar rats, all rats were exposed to 
parent drug and its metabolite M1 over the whole sampling interval (24h). In terms of AUC(0-last), the 
metabolite M1 exposure in plasma represented on average 36.3% (range: 34.2% to 37.6%) of parent 
compound exposure, reaching the maximum concentration of 132 ng/mL at 2 hours post-dose. Same 
results have been seen in monkeys administered with 3 mg/kg/day risdiplam over 3 days: M1 
exposure accounted for an average 12.4% and 15.2% of parent compound on day 1 and day 3 
respectively. The higher exposure to both analytes was observed on Day 3: AUC(0-last) Day3/Day1 
ratios were 2.32 and 2.81 for risdiplam and M1 respectively. 
Excretion 
Elimination studies performed in rats and monkeys confirmed faeces as the main route of excretion, 
while excretion via urine accounted for a much lower amount. 
Following single oral (5 mg/kg) and intravenous (2 mg/kg) administration of 14C-risdiplam to naïve 
rats there was nearly complete excretion, with approximately 87% and 83% of the radioactivity 
recovered in faeces within 72 hours, while urine accounted for 7% and 9% of dose, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 46/293 
 
 
For metabolite identification, pool samples (0 to 48 hours) were investigated: unchanged risdiplam was 
identified as the major drug-related component in excreta, accounting for 50% and 44% of the dose in 
naïve rats following oral and intravenous administration respectively, while metabolite M5 was the 
most abundant metabolite identified (6.8 and 5.7% of the dose following oral and IV administration 
respectively).  
In BDC rats following 5 mg/kg oral administration and 2 mg/kg IV, 11%, 70% and 8% (oral) and 17%, 
50% and 19% (IV) of the dose was recovered within 72 hours in the urine, faeces and bile 
respectively. 
In line with previous results, analysis of urine and faeces collected over 7 days after single dosing (5 
mg/kg oral and 2 mg/kg IV) of 14C-risdiplam to Albino and partially pigmented rats showed faecal 
excretion as the main route of elimination, with the total amount of the radioactivity excreted via 
faeces 
accounting for up to 87% of the dose following oral administration and ~ 79% of the dose following IV 
administration. Urine excretion was between 12 and 7% of the dose following both route of 
administration.  
Faecal elimination has been confirmed as the main route in human mass balance study, in which most 
of 14C-risdiplam-related radioactivity was found in faeces (53.2%) followed by urine (28%). 
Risdiplam has also been found to be excreted in milk of lactating female rats treated. Mean 
milk:plasma concentration ratios were between 1.21 and 3.50. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In human hepatocytes, risdiplam or M1 did not exhibit significant ability to induce mRNA of cytochrome 
P450 isoforms. Similarly, risdiplam demonstrated low potential to cause direct inhibition of all CYPs 
isoforms. At the highest concentration tested, no significant reversible inhibition was detected for both 
risdiplam and M1, except for CYP3A4/5. Risdiplam tested up to 12.5 μM demonstrated low potential to 
cause direct inhibition of CYP3A4/5 and exhibited a maximal 28% and 55% inhibition for midazolam 
and testosterone as a substrate, respectively. An IC50 of 11 μM was estimated for inhibition of 
testosterone metabolism. 
Risdiplam did not inhibit MDR1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 nor OAT3 when tested up to 50 μM, while 
displayed significant inhibition against OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K, with IC50 values of 8.72, 0.15 and 
0.09 μM, respectively.  
M1 did not displayed inhibition potential of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 when dosed at 50 μM, while 
at 2 μM M1 did not inhibit OAT1 and OCT2 but moderately inhibited MATE1 and MATE2-K by 26% and 
47%, respectively. At 20 μM, RO7112063 inhibited the OAT1-, OCT2-, MATE1 and MATE2-K-mediated 
transport by 34, 45, 77 and 54%, respectively. 
Regarding OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K, a 7-concentration follow-up inhibition assay was performed 
resulting in 34, 66 and 45% maximum inhibition at 20 μM, respectively. For the interaction with MATE1 
an IC50 value of 14.8 μM was calculated. 
In line with EMA guideline on DDI (2012) and according to the applicant, these results reveal a 
potential clinical perpetrator drug-drug-interaction risk involving MATE1 and MATE2-K for risdiplam. 
Therefore, the applicant is requested to amend section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to highlight that 
caution is advised in case of co-administration with substrates of these transporters, providing also 
examples of MATE1 and MATE2-k substrates potentially co-administered with risdiplam. 
Distribution into melanin-containing parts of the eye (choroid + RPE, iris, sclera) was significantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 47/293 
 
 
higher than in non-pigmented ocular structures (retina, lens, vitreous body) or the rest of the body 
(muscle, brain, CSF). The higher accumulation in melanin containing tissues is in line with the strong 
melanin binding observed in vitro. The elimination rate in pigmented tissues differed from the rest of 
the body and drug levels were still considerably high in the eye, especially in melanin-containing parts 
in both pigmented rats and monkeys after treatment-free periods. However, a clear decline and 
elimination could be observed. In toxicology studies, retinal degeneration occurred after prolonged 
dosing and whose mechanism is not fully understood. As the applicant reported, risdiplam is light 
sensitive, suggesting that risdiplam and/or M1 metabolite photodegradation products could be toxic to 
eye tissues. Risdiplam was subjected to in vitro phototoxicity evaluation in 3T3 fibroblasts utilizing the 
neutral red uptake assay, showing no phototoxicity. This study implicitly included the evaluation of any 
photodegradation products that were possibly generated from risdiplam under UV exposure conditions 
in the in vitro test. The existing in vitro study for phototoxicity as conducted in compliance with [ICH 
S10] is sufficient to conclude that there is no phototoxicity risk from risdiplam in clinical use. The 
location of the toxicity in the retina periphery is inconsistent with any UV related breakdown of 
risdiplam or its M1 metabolite, as the relevant spectrum of light does not reach the retina, in particular 
not the periphery of the retina. Therefore, the systemic distribution of risdiplam into the retina and its 
action at this site on the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors is not envisaged to be 
dependent on UV exposure, and is considered to be associated with risdiplam itself (including any M1) 
but not related to photodegradation. In accordance, in clinical studies with risdiplam, comprehensive 
ophthalmological evaluations, which included examination of all melanin containing eyes structures 
(choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, iris, and sclera), as well as retinal imaging by optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), confirmed the absence of any findings suggestive of phototoxicity reactions in eye 
structures in 465 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treated with risdiplam for up to 3 years 
[Sergott et al. 2020]. 
Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety profile of risdiplam was assessed in a comprehensive toxicology programme. The 
intended pharmacological target, the SMN2 gene, exists only in humans, and thus a pharmacological 
responder species as requested by existing guidelines does not exist unless studies are conducted in 
transgenic mouse models. However, the use of the available transgenic mouse models of SMA for 
toxicity testing was not considered appropriate due to lack of availability in sufficiently large numbers, 
lack of suitable characterisation of relevant physiological parameters, difficulties in handling and 
treatment and the lack of comprehensive background information about physiology and pathology in 
these models. 
Hence the relevance of the animal models was mainly judged on the basis of secondary mRNA splice 
targets occurring in animals and humans. FOXM1 and MADD were emerging from toxicity studies on a 
series of SMN2 splice modifiers as primary candidates for these secondary splice targets with 
toxicological implications. The monkey was considered to be a suitable and translational species for the 
safety assessment of risdiplam for use in humans due to the similar changes in splicing in secondary 
target genes upon treatment with risdiplam, as observed in SMA patient-derived fibroblasts, in 
stimulated monkey and human monocytes and iPSCs, and in monkey spleen tissue in vivo. The 
secondary splice targets were largely consistent with those published for another series of compounds 
enhancing the SMN2 exon 7-including variant [Palacino et al. 2015]. For at least one of the secondary 
splice targets identified for monkey and human cells, FOXM1, species differences exist between the 
primate (monkey and human) and the rat. 
Mouse (carcinogenicity), rat (general toxicity, juvenile toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity) and 
rabbit (reproductive toxicity) were used as well-established toxicology species for respective study 
types in small molecule drug development. However, its acknowledged that these species are non-

responders for the SMN2 splice modification. In contrast to the monkey, they also may not show off-
target splicing events fully resembling those seen in human cells due to differences in exon/intron 
sequences and splice variants. 
Metabolic profiling fully supported the toxicology species selection (Section 4.4). 
Since treatment of SMA preferentially aims at babies and children, but also includes adults, the safety 
of risdiplam was investigated in both juvenile and adult animals. 
The toxicology, safety pharmacology and secondary pharmacology programme for risdiplam included: 
Results from the repeated dose toxicity identified toxicities with very low safety margins. It has been 
claimed by the applicant that the identified risks and respective low safety margins may be accepted 
based on the severity of the disease, limited alternative treatment options and lack of an increased 
sensitivity of patients towards the observed animal toxicities. Moreover, key toxicities observed in 
animals were declared to be either monitorable (epithelia, haematology) or could be mitigated with 
imposed contraception requirements (male germ cells, embryofoetal effects) in clinical studies. 
A two-year carcinogenicity study in rats is planned to be conducted post-approval. This is acceptable 
and in agreement with feedback received from CHMP and PDCO. Reference to the ongoing 
carcinogenicity study in rats is presented in SmPC section 5.3. 
Except for 3 non-pivotal studies, all the others were GLP compliant.  
In relation to the data on fertility, further amendments were made to section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The juvenile rat studies reveal an increased sensitivity to risdiplam treatment in pre-weaning rats in 
comparison to older rats, resulting in high mortality rates observed at doses at or above 3.5 
mg/kg/day (AUCs around 3000 ng·h/mL or above) within 2 to 7 days of initiation of treatment. It is 
proposed that the increased sensitivity is correlated to a higher free fraction and longer half-life of 
risdiplam in pre-weaning rats compared to older rats. However, it was unclear if also the toxicity profile 
of risdiplam is was different in pre-weaning rats. The applicant has provided further clarifications in 
relation to the observed sensitivity of pre-weaning rats. According to these clarifications, the causes of 
the deaths observed in the DRF finding study were not identified, as no or only very limited 
histopathology could be performed on the decedent neonates. Nevertheless, results from the limited 
histopathology revealed findings (toxicity profile) consistent with findings in the toxicity studies in older 
rats. The increased sensitivity of the neonate rats versus older rats can reasonably be attributed to a 
higher free fraction and longer half-life of risdiplam in pre-weaning rats compared to that in older 
animals. Such higher exposure levels are not relevant for the clinical use of risdiplam in the paediatric 
patient population, where the free fraction is comparable across all ages.  
In the 4-week juvenile rat study , it is noted that minimal to mild nephroblastomatosis (a pre-
neoplastic lesion) was observed in all test-item treated groups; one male at 0.75 mg/kg/day (low 
dose) and one male and one female at 1.5 mg/kg/day (intermediate dose), and two females at 2.5 
mg/kg/day (high dose). After the 8-week recovery period, malignant nephroblastoma were present in 
the kidney of one female each at 1.5 mg/kg/day and 2.5 mg/kg/day. In the 13-week study, a 
malignant nephroblastoma was observed in one male at 7.5 mg/kg/day (high dose). The study reports 
concluded these findings as spontaneous in origin. As rat kidney neoplasms are uncommon and given 
the high risdiplam distribution to kidney and that the findings were only observed in risdiplam-treated 
animals, a further discussion on the relation to treatment and clinical relevance was requested.  
After the applicant’s response, it was still considered that it is not clear whether risdiplam could have 
had an impact on the maturation of spontaneously occurring nephroblastomatosis. The applicant has 
provided further clarifications on the significance of the nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma 
Assessment report

observed in two juvenile rat studies [a 4-week study with treatment during PND4-31 and a 13-week 
study with treatment during PND22-112, respectively]). 
According to the response, the 13-week study showed no evidence of effect, based on incidence. This 
study showed no nephroblastomatosis and the incidence of nephroblastoma (one male at 7.5 
mg/kg/day) was in line with the historical control data. 
As for the 4-week study, this showed incidences of nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma above 
the historical control data provided by the CRO. However, the same was not observed in a previous 4-
week study with a comparable study design (only 2 dose groups instead of 3, but same size of groups) 
using similar dosage in Wistar rats dosed from PND4 to 31. Furthermore, there is no indication that 
risdiplam could affect genes mentioned as important in the context of nephroblastoma.  
The CHMP considers that there is no need for further amendments to section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
It may be concluded that the increased incidence of nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma 
observed in a 4-week study in juvenile rats does not represent a risk to patients. This finding was not 
reproduced in another study with identical study design. Furthermore, knowledge on the development 
of nephroblastomatosis and nephroblastoma, key genes known to be associated with development of 
nephroblastoma and evidence for lack of effects of risdiplam on these genes does not indicate that 
exposure to risdiplam may lead to the development of nephroblastomatosis and/or nephroblastoma. 
The phototoxic properties of risdiplam were discussed in detail. In the 3T3 test using an UVA light 
source (315-690 nm), risdiplam was concluded as non-phototoxic up to the limit of solubility (9 
µg/mL). It’s agreed that risdiplam absorbs in the UV range and was not phototoxic in vitro. The study 
implicitly included the evaluation of any photodegradation products that were possibly generated from 
risdiplam under UV exposure conditions in the in vitro test. The existing in vitro study for phototoxicity 
as conducted in compliance with [ICH S10] could provide sufficient evidence to conclude that there is 
no phototoxicity risk arising from risdiplam. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The results of the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies seem to support 
in general the use of risdiplam in clinical practice in patients with SMA. Exposure levels at the no 
observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) of most nonclinical safety findings might be considered 
sufficient to elicit pharmacodynamic effects by increasing SMN protein levels. This has formed the basis 
for studying the efficacy of risdiplam at the doses used in pivotal clinical studies in SMA patients of all 
ages and severity types of the disease.  
Risdiplam unlikely represents a risk for the environment. However, the log Kow values were calculated 
using the HPLC method that covers log Kow(s) in the range of 0-6 and may not be reliable enough for 
risdiplam. The applicant must commit to submitting the results of the shake-flask test by the end of 
April 2021. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the identified non-clinical issues: 
●  a  two-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  is  planned  to  be  conducted  as  a  post-approval 
commitment. 
●  accomplishment of the shake-flask test according to OECD 107 that should be available by the

The risdiplam clinical development programme is a comprehensive series of studies, designed to 
confirm the clinical benefit of risdiplam for patients with both infantile- and later-onset SMA. According 
to the Clinical Overview, at the time of submission, the risdiplam clinical programme is the largest 
clinical development programme conducted for SMA. The breadth and scope of the overall population 
included in these trials support the proposed broad indication for risdiplam for the treatment of SMA. 
●  Analytical methods 
Risdiplam and its main M1 metabolite’s concentrations were determined both alone) and all together in 
human plasma through validated LC MS/MS methods. Risdiplam alone was also determined in urine 
samples through a LC MS/MS method . For both plasma and urine analytical methods, preventive 
measures described in the Validation Report and in the mentioned Bioanalytical Reports were correctly 
applied to mitigate the impact of carry-over for RO7034067. 
Since different methods were used to determine the same analytes and different laboratories were 
involved in the analyses, a cross-validation was consequently performed . As risdiplam is sensitive to 
light and M1 is sensitive both to light and oxidation in solution, ascorbic acid was added as a stabilizer 
and the sample analysis was handled under light protection and cold conditions.  
Fully validated LC MS/MS methods were also used to determine risdiplam together with diazepam , 
diazepam + M1 and quinidine . Same methodology was used to determine itraconazole + its 
metabolites) and midazolam + its metabolites). 
Four liquid scintillation counting (LSC) methods were developed to quantify 14C radioactivity in human 
plasma, whole blood, urine and faeces samples. 
Protein binding was investigated in human plasma using the equilibrium dialysis method with diazepam 
or quinidine as control compound. Diazepam, quinidine and risdiplam were determined using validated 
LC-MS/MS methods . 
Clinical genotyping for the determination of SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers was determined either by 
digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by the SMA Plus test      .  
Expression of SMN1, SMN2 full length, and SMNΔ7 (SMN2 mRNA with exon 7 missing) mRNA was 
measured using a quantitative reverse transcription multiplex PCR method, To determine SMN protein 
in human whole blood, a prototype assay was developed and validated.

Evaluation and Qualification of Models  
Population Pharmacokinetics Model 
A PopPK model was initially developed on a total of 3,478 PK observations from venous and capillary 
blood samples from 151 SMA patients and healthy volunteers available, from the four clinical studies 
BP29840, BP39054 (JEWELFISH), BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 1, and BP39056 (FIREFISH) Part 1 and 
Part 2.The initial population PK model was then applied to the new data set pooled from 5 clinical 
studies, i.e. BP29840, BP39054, BP39055, BP39056 and BP41361. Upon evaluation and confirmation 
of the reference model as the base model to the new dataset, covariate analysis was performed. 
The final selected PopPK model is based on a structural model consisting of three transit-
compartments absorption connected to a systemic linear two-compartmental PK model. The model 
included as covariates the time-varying body weight effect described by allometry model on CL/F and 
Q/F with a shared estimated exponent, and on Vc/F and Vp/F with a shared estimated exponent; a 
time-varying age effect as a maturation function with sigmoidal model structure on CL/F and Vc/F, and 
the effect of healthy subject on CL/F. The model incorporated IIV on CL/F, Vc/F, and ktr as 
independent random effects and separate proportional residual errors on plasma and capillary blood 
samples. 
The parameter estimates summarised in the Table below show that the parameters were estimated 
with good precision indicated by the relative standard error being less than20% except for Vp/F and 
Age50-Vc/F (25.9% and 21.1%, respectively). The 95% CIs were comparable between the estimates 
by the covariance matrix and the bootstrap analysis, and the intervals of each parameter estimates 
were considered reasonable. 
Degree of η-shrinkage were 5.43, 22.9 and 10.1% for CL/F, ktr and Vc/F, respectively, indicating that 
the analyses with post-hoc parameters and estimation of individual secondary PK parameters such as 
AUC and Cav could be reliably performed. The shrinkage for residual errors were 5.58 and 2.46% for 
venous and capillary blood samples, respectively. The condition number was low (40.4) and none of 
the parameters estimated showed high correlations (>0.9) with the others.

The pc-VPC with time after the last dose stratified by age (Figure below) showed consistent median 
between the predictions and observations in all age groups. Although minor deviations were seen in 
2.5th or 97.5th percentiles in some of the time points, the observations were mostly within the 
respective confidence interval and prediction of central tendency and variability was considered 
acceptable.  
Based  on  the  pc-VPCs,  the  predictive  performance  of  the  final  PK  model  of  risdiplam  was  considered 
satisfactory.

2.4.1. Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Study BP29840 enabled to characterize appropriately the absorption and disposition of risdiplam after 
single ascending oral doses, from 0.6 mg to 18 mg, in healthy subjects, based on the pharmacokinetic 
profiles derived from 19 venous blood samples, collected at pre-dose and at 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 
4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00, 72.00, 96.00, 144.00 and 216.00 h 
post dose. Urine samples were also collected at pre-dose and for the following intervals: 0-6h, 6-12h, 
12-24h, 24-48h and 48-72h. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 61/293 
 
 
 
 
 
The ascending doses were stopped at 18 mg, with a mean exposure of 1310 h.ng/mL derived for AUC0-
24h. None of the 6 subjects dosed with 18 mg (cohorts 4 and 6) showed AUC0-24h values above 1500 
h.ng/mL (the range was 1210 to 1470 h.ng/mL), as the pre-specified individual exposure cap for the 
parameter based on the findings in the animal toxicology studies. 
Risdiplam showed to be rapidly absorbed, as first quantifiable concentrations observed for all subjects 
occurred between 0.5 and 1.0 hour post-dose, and for all administered doses. Median Tmax values 
were derived as between 2.0 and 3.0 hours (ranging from 1.0 to 4.50 hours) post-dose. In a closer 
observation of the mean pharmacokinetic profiles until 24h, double peaks are seen at 4h and 10h, 
corresponding to the time of meals. 
A linear and dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC was observed. 
The performed mass balance study also showed a rapid absorption of [14C/12C]-RO7034067, with 
measurable radioactivity in plasma in all subjects at the first sampling time point at 0.5 hour post-dose 
(and at 1 hour post-dose for all subjects in blood). The mean Cmax and AUC0-inf obtained for 
[14C/12C]-RO7034067 radioactivity were similar to the mean values obtained in SAD study BP29840. 
However, the variability (CV%) was higher. 
Characterisation of risdiplam pharmacokinetics on the mass balance study was achieved by the 
collection of venous blood samples during the study for the quantification of radioactivity in plasma at 
the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 
120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288, 312, 336, 360, 384, 408, 432, 456, 480, and 504 h post 
dose, corresponding to 22 days of blood sampling. Urine and faeces were also quantitatively collected 
at the following time intervals: 0-24h, 24-48h, 48-72h, 72-96h, 96-120h, 120-144h, 144-168h, 168-
192h, 192-216h, 216-240h, 240-264h, 264-288h, 288-312h, 312-336h, 336-360h, 360-384h, 384-
408h, 408-432h, 432-456h, 456-480h, 480-504h, and then every 24h from day 22 to day 36. 
The performed study NP39625 also showed for the Japanese population a rapid absorption of risdiplam 
and similar dose normalised exposure to the Caucasian population selected in study BP29840. 
The proposed wording for Section 5.2 (Absorption) of the SmPC is in line with the observed PK data. 
Moreover, the SmPC proposes patients do drink water after taking Evrysdi, to ensure the drug has 
been completely swallowed. 
No relative or absolute bioavailability studies have been conducted. However, the applicant expects a 
close to complete absorption of risdiplam from the oral dose. Based on mass balance data, in vitro 
metabolism data and PBPK and popPK modelling, the bioavailability of risdiplam is expected to be high 
(>0.8). 
Risdiplam is to be administered as an oral solution. The to-be-marketed formulation is identical to the 
formulation used in the pivotal clinical studies, and therefore no bioequivalence study is required. The 
formulations used in the exploratory Part 1 and pivotal Part 2 of the Phase II clinical studies are almost 
identical solutions (except for isomalt), and therefore no comparative bioavailability study was 
necessary during the drug development phases.  
Based on the summary of results obtained for the investigation of a potential food effect on study 
BP29840 (Part I) performed with healthy subjects, intake of a high-calorie, high-fat breakfast had no 
relevant effect on the PK of risdiplam at a dose of 6 mg (F01 formulation). However, conclusion is 
made by comparing two cohorts with a limited number of subjects (n=3). No other dedicated food 
effect study was performed.

EMA/216061/2021 
Page 62/293 
 
 
 
 
In studies with SMA patients (BP39056 (FIREFISH), BP39055 (SUNFISH) and BP39054 (JEWELFISH)), 
study medication was taken once daily in the morning with the patient’s regular morning meal, except 
when site visits were planned and study medication was administered at the clinical site. 
Only a limited available data for a food effect conclusion (derived from Study BP29840) is available. 
The clinical studies in SMA patients were conducted with the recommendation to take risdiplam with 
the morning meal. Therefore, the applicant proposes to update the SmPC to indicate that risdiplam 
shall be taken with a meal, as done during the clinical studies. 
Distribution 
From in vitro studies, it was concluded for risdiplam an average fraction unbound value of 11% in 
human, with the drug being predominantly bound to serum albumin. Moreover, no age dependency on 
protein binding was detected. An in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.3 was also derived. From the mass 
balance study, the blood-to-plasma ratio ranged between 0.691 to 0.925, over all time points for which 
this blood-to-plasma ratio could be calculated (1 hour to 120 hours post-dose), with a mean of 0.822. 
By individual, the blood-to-plasma ratio showed a mean range of 0.808 to 0.910 along time. 
Differences found between in vitro and in vivo data for Blood-to-Plasma partitioning were justified by 
the applicant by the use of different methods. B/P ratio is mostly between 0.8 and 1.0 (0.87±0.07). 
The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was derived from SAD study (BP29840) for the different doses 
(0.6 to 18 mg). The volume of distribution showed to increase with dose, from 247 L (0.6 mg) to 542 L 
(18 mg). The mean elimination half-life has also increased with the dose, from 25h (0.6 mg) to 69h (18 
mg).  
The differences in estimates for the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and for the mean elimination 
half-life derived for the 0.6 mg and 18 mg dose administered in SAD study were justified to be related 
to the low number of subjects per dose cohort. Consequently, these results should be seen with caution. 
The proposed wording for Section 5.2 (Distribution) of the SmPC is in line with estimates from in vitro 
and population pharmacokinetics modelling. 
Elimination 
Based on results of metabolic characterisation, approximately 8% of risdiplam dose is renally excreted 
as unchanged form. A low renal excretion is in accordance to the results from SAD study, where a 
mean of approximately 4% was derived for the fraction excreted parameter, for all doses (0.6 to 18 
mg).  Renal clearance was approximately estimated as 325 mL/h for all doses (range 316 to 333 
mL/h) (see table below). In the SAD study, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of RO7034067 
was 40.1 to 68.7 hours from 2 to 18 mg. 
Assuming a free fraction in human plasma 10.7% for risdiplam the expected filtration clearance is 
approximately 13.4 mL/min (assuming GFR=125 mL/min). For a renal clearance of 5.42 mL/min (or 
325 mL/h), risdiplam could be, apparently, renally reabsorbed. Nevertheless, no data from in-vitro or 
in animals experiments indicate a renal reabsorption of risdiplam: 
-  As risdiplam molecule (pKa1 = 3.78 (base), pKa2 = 6.62 (base)) is expected to be ionised in 
urine, it makes its resorption unlikely. 
- 
In vitro (transport) and animals data did not indicate renal reabsorption of risdiplam. In the 
multiple dose study performed with healthy subjects (Study BP41361, the mean elimination 
half-life derived on steady state for the 5 mg QD regimen was 37.1h (CV 17.2%, range 28.9h 
to 46.6h) and for the 8 mg QD regimen was 41.1h (CV 15.9%, range 30.5h to 53.8h). 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 63/293 
 
 
 
Population  PK  analyses  estimated  in  the  final  model  an  apparent  clearance  (CL/F)  of  2.61  L/h  for 
risdiplam. Based on study BP39055 (SUNFISH) PopPK analysis, for the total of 117 SMA patients (type 
2 and type 3), with ages ranging from 3.2 to 26.4 years, the elimination half-life was estimated with a 
median of 51h (ranging from 25.4 to 107h). 
The proposed wording for Section 5.2 (Elimination) of the SmPC is in line with results from the popPK 
analysis, i.e. «Population PK analyses estimated an apparent clearance (CL/F) of 2.6 L/h for risdiplam. 
The effective half-life of risdiplam was approximately 50 hours in SMA patients. 
Metabolism 
Risdiplam was relatively metabolically stable in incubations with human liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes, with ≥89% and ≥98% of parent drug recovered unchanged after incubation, 
respectively. 
The main site of biotransformation was the piperazine moiety. The N-hydroxy metabolite M1 was 
identified in liver microsomes and hepatocyte samples of all species. All other metabolites were formed 
in the liver microsomes and hepatocytes of at least 3 species. No additional major metabolites were 
observed following incubation with microsomes and hepatocytes from other species. 
In in vitro metabolism studies with recombinantly expressed human enzymes incubations of unlabelled 
and 14C-risdiplam with recombinant human CYP and FMO enzymes have shown that risdiplam can be 
metabolised by both FMO1 and FMO3, and minimally by CYPs 1A1, 2J2, 3A4, and 3A7. Multiple 
oxidative metabolism products were generated by each of the enzymes, with FMO enzymes favouring 
the N-oxidation pathway to generate M1. M1 can be generated by both FMO1 and FMO3 as well as 
CYPs 1A1, 2J2, and 3A enzymes. 
The metabolic pathway of risdiplam in humans was proposed on the basis of the results from in vitro 
metabolism studies using human hepatocytes, human liver microsomes, microsomes expressing 
human CYP isoforms and the results from the mass balance study. Parent drug was the main drug-
related component in plasma (accounting for 83% of drug-related material in circulation as percent of 
AUC0-48h) and excreta (urine and faeces). The main site of biotransformation was the piperazine 
moiety. M1 (N-hydroxy metabolite) accounted for 14% of total radioactivity (percent AUC0-48) in 
plasma; it was excreted in urine. Additional low-level metabolites (M2, M7 and M26), all resulting from 
biotransformation of the piperazine moiety were observed in plasma. M5, M7 (both resulting from 
biotransformation of the piperazine moiety), M10 (carboxylic acid metabolite) and M18 (sulphate 
conjugate) were the most abundant metabolites in faeces. M7 was the most abundant metabolite in 
urine. 
The metabolic characterisation is presented in the Table below.

A concern on the use truncated AUC0-48h for conclusions instead of AUC0-inf was raised, given the 
expected risdiplam elimination half-life (approximately 50h). However, based on applicant’s analysis, 
the metabolite identification at the truncated area under the concentration-time curve from Time 0 to 
48 hours (AUC0-48) in the human absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (hADME) study is 
considered representative of AUCinf, considering that nonclinical and clinical PK data, as well as safety 
data, do not suggest a potential different metabolite profile in plasma beyond 48 h post-dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021

Moreover, the applicant has additionally performed an exploratory metabolite identification on selected 
plasma samples from HVs dosed with a single dose of 18 mg risdiplam (single ascending dose [SAD] 
study - BP29840) in order to identify the major circulating drug-related material. The exploratory 
metabolite identification data up to 216 h post dose in the SAD study, from a representative individual, 
increases the confidence that the metabolite identification at truncated AUC0-48 in the hADME study is 
representative of AUCinf. It was concluded that the gap due to the limited analytical sensitivity of the 
radio profiling method resulting in remaining unexplained radioactivity is distributed to a number of 
minor metabolites, as it was indicated by the more sensitive MS-based analysis using plasma samples 
from the SAD study. Based on this exploratory analysis, it was not identified any persistent metabolite 
with a significantly longer t1/2 than unchanged risdiplam up to 216 h. 
The proposed human metabolic pathway is displayed in the Figure below. 
Figure 9 
The proposed wording for Section 5.2 (Elimination) of the SmPC is in line with data from in vitro 
metabolism studies, mass balance study and pharmacology (PD) study: 
« Risdiplam is primarily metabolised by flavin monooxygenase 1 and 3 (FMO1 and FMO3), and also by 
CYPs 1A1, 2J2, 3A4 and 3A7. 
Approximately 53% of the dose (14% unchanged risdiplam) was excreted in the feces and 28% in 
urine (8% unchanged risdiplam). Parent drug was the major component found in plasma, accounting 
for 83% of drug related material in circulation. The pharmacologically inactive metabolite M1 was 
identified as the major circulating metabolite.».  
According to the GL on the Investigation of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1), in general, 
enzymes involved in metabolic pathways estimated to contribute to ≥ 25% of drug elimination should 
be identified if possible and the in vivo contribution quantified. This applies to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes and non-CYP enzymes.

In the mass balance study, the parent drug was the major component found in plasma, accounting for 
83% of drug-related material in circulation (percent of AUC0-48h). The pharmacologically inactive 
metabolite M1 (N-oxidation of risdiplam) was identified as the major circulating metabolite and 
represented 14% of drug-related AUC0-48h. Four additional low level metabolites (M2, M7, M9 and M26) 
were observed in plasma. Relative to the AUC of total drug-related material in plasma, no individual 
metabolite accounted for more than 2.2%. 
In the multiple dose study, the applicant has characterised the pharmacokinetic of metabolite M1, 
showing a metabolite ratio that ranged from 0.188 to 0.303 for AUC0-24h and from 0.160 to 0.233 for 
Cmax. The study design enabled to well characterize the pharmacokinetics of metabolite M1, which 
presents a similar elimination half-life as the parent compound. 
Despite a polymorphism is described for FMO enzymes [Hisamuddin et al, Pharmacogenomics, 8(6), 
635–643], it will have no impact on the elimination of risdiplam, as M1 presents a low contribution 
(<25%) for the elimination of the drug. 
Dose Proportionality and time-dependency 
Based on results from SAD study, the dose proportionality was assessed across risdiplam doses by PK 
assessor, using the power model as described by Smith et al. [Pharm Res. 2000 Oct;17(10):1278-83] 
on log-normalised AUC0-t and Cmax values (Figures below). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and 
overall plasma exposure (AUCInf) increased in a dose-proportional fashion over the investigated dose 
range of risdiplam, after a single dose administration.

Risdiplam steady-state peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and exposure (AUCtau) increased slightly less 
than proportional to the increase in dose from 5 to 8 mg daily, with a Dose Proportionality Factor of 
0.9 and 0.86, respectively. 
Based on results presented for study no. BP41361, the actual accumulation of risdiplam after multiple 
doses, based on ARAUC and ARCmax, was 3.15 and 3.04, respectively, for the 5 mg QD regimen and 2.76 
and 2.58, respectively, for the 8 mg QD regimen. This indicates there was an approximately 3-fold 
accumulation of risdiplam over the course of the study on both regimens. 
On steady state, the elimination half-life (t1/2) and Clearance (ClSS/F) for risdiplam are similar between 
the 5 mg regimen and the 8 mg regimen, indicating no saturation in the elimination processes (table 
below).

According to multiple-dose Study BP41361 results, in healthy subjects the steady-state is attained 
approximately after 7 days of treatment with 5mg of risdiplam administered once daily. Also, in SMA 
patients (Studies BP39055 and BP39056) the steady state is attained after 7 to 14 days of treatment 
with risdiplam administered once daily at different dosing schemes. Data have been provided in both 
graphic and tabular form and confirm that in healthy subjects the steady state is attained in both cases 
after 7 days and is maintained within day 14 of treatment. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability  
In the single ascending dose study performed with healthy subjects, variability in plasma PK 
parameters was low, ranging from 9-27% for Cmax and from 6-29% for AUCInf. The variability was 
therefore less than 30% on both parameters. 
In the multiple dose study performed with healthy subjects, variability in plasma PK parameters was 
also low. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The following studies contribute to the characterisation of the Pharmacokinetics in target population: 
●  BP39056 (FIREFISH): a two-part, multicentre, single arm, open-label study to investigate 
safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy in infants with Type 1 SMA. Plasma PK samples were 
collected from Type 1 SMA patients. For Part 1, plasma PK samples were collected at: 2, 4, 6h 
post-dose on Day 1, pre-dose, 2, 4, 6 h post-dose on Weeks 4,12, 52, 78 and 104, while pre-
dose samples were drawn on Day 2, pre-dose and 4 h post-dose samples were collected on 
Weeks 1 (Day 7), 2, 8, 17, 26, 35, 43, 61, 70, 87 and 96. For Part 2, plasma PK samples were 
collected at: 2, 4, 6 h post-dose on Day 1, pre-dose, 2, 4, 6 h postdose on Weeks 4, 8, 26, 43, 
78 and 96, while pre-dose samples were drawn on Weeks 1 (Day 2), 2, 17, 35, 52, 61, 70, 87 
and 104. 
A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the dose-finding Part 1 of the study. A total of 41 
patients were enrolled in Part 2 of the study which assessed safety and efficacy of risdiplam at 
the pivotal dose. The open-label extension phase of both parts is ongoing. 
●  BP39055 (SUNFISH): a two-part, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
study to investigate safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients. On 
Part 1, plasma PK samples were collected at: 1, 2, 4, 6 h postdose on Day 1, pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 
6 h post-dose on Weeks 4, 8, 52 and 87, while predose samples were drawn on Weeks 1 (Day 
7), 2, 17, 35, 70 and 104. On Part 2, the PK sample collections were at 1, 2, 4, 6 h post-dose 
on Day 1, pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6 h postdose on Weeks 4, 52 and 87, while pre-dose samples 
were drawn on Weeks 1 (Day 7), 2, 8, 17, 35, 70 and 104 
A total of 51 patients were enrolled in the dose-finding Part 1 of the study, and 180 patients 
were enrolled into the pivotal Part 2 (120 patients on risdiplam, 60 patients on placebo) which 
assessed safety and efficacy of risdiplam at the selected dose.  The open-label extension phase 
of both parts is ongoing. 
●  BP39054 (JEWELFISH): an open-label, non-comparative study to investigate safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD in adults, children, and infants with SMA who were previously enrolled 
in Study BP29420 (MOONFISH) with the splicing modifier RO6885247 (RG7800) or previously 
treated with nusinersen, olesoxime (a Roche development molecule which has since been 
discontinued), or AVXS-101 (ZOLGENSMA→; a gene therapeutic). Study enrollment has been 
completed with 174 patients, and the study is ongoing.

Plasma PK samples were collected from Type 1, 2 or 3 SMA patients at 1, 2, 4, 6 h postdose on 
Day 1, pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6 h post-dose on Weeks 4, 8, 52 and 87 while predose samples were 
drawn on Weeks 1 (Day 7), 2, 17, 26, 35, 43, 70 and 104 according to protocol version 1 
(2017). Sampling times were however adjusted on study protocol versions 2 (2018) and 3 
(2019) to the following PK sampling points: 1, 2, 4, 6 h post-dose on Day 1, pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 
6 h postdose on Weeks 4, 13, 52 and 91, and pre-dose samples on Weeks 2, 26, 39, 65 and 
104 for patients aged 2 – 60 years. For patients aged 6 months to 2 years the PK samples 
were collected at the following time points: 2, 4, 6 h post-dose on Day 1, predose, 2, 4, 6 h 
post-dose on Weeks 4, 13, 26, 39, 78, 91, and pre-dose samples on Weeks 2, 52, 65 and 104. 
●  BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH):  a study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, PK and PD of 
risdiplam in pre-symptomatic infants (from birth to 6 weeks of age at enrollment) who have 
been genetically diagnosed with SMA. Recruitment is ongoing, and 12 patients have been 
enrolled by 25 February 21.  
The pharmacokinetic profiles obtained for SMA patients in the three clinical studies (BP39056, BP39055 
and BP39054) were analysed through a population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) approach.  
The PopPK model was initially developed on a total of 3,478 pharmacokinetics observations from 
venous and capillary blood samples from 151 SMA patients and healthy volunteers available as of 24 
April 2019 from the four clinical studies BP29840, BP39054 (JEWELFISH), BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 1, 
and BP39056 (FIREFISH) Part 1 and Part 2. Qualification of PopPK model is described in the respective 
section of this assessment report. 
The primary individual PK parameters estimated for risdiplam for each patient participating in Study 
BP39054 (JEWELFISH), BP39055 (SUNFISH) and BP39056 (FIREFISH) were used to derive secondary 
PK parameters such as AUC0-24h and average concentration over the observation period (Cav). These 
secondary PK parameters are summarised by study and assigned dose. In addition to the predicted 
Cmax, the highest observed actual concentration is also reported. Due to the dose-escalation design in 
Parts 1 of BP39055 (SUNFISH) and BP39056 (FIREFISH), most patients had at least one change in the 
assigned dose during the course of their treatment, which is reflected and depicted in the AUC0-24h 
time courses. The individual patient’s time courses of risdiplam AUC0-24h are shown for each study. 
The Figure below displays the exposure versus age and body weight, respectively, by study for all 
patients.  
The AUC0-24h at the Month 12 visit (or the last dosing occasion for Study BP39054, as most patients 
had not reached 12 months of treatment in this study) was estimated using post-hoc PK parameters of 
the final model and was approximately 2000 ng•h/mL (range: 1740 – 2070 ng•h/mL) across all 
studies in SMA patients. The selected dosing regimen of 0.2 mg/kg for patients < 2 years, 0.25 mg/kg 
for patients ≥ 2 years with a body weight of < 20 kg, and 5 mg for patients ≥ 2 years with a body 
weight of ≥ 20 kg indeed achieved the targeted mean AUC0-24h of approximately 2000 ng•h/mL 
across all studies.

Figure 14 - Simulated Cmax for SMA Patients in Studies BP39055, BP39056 (Part 2) and

Based on the proposed posology, patients (with a body weight > 50 kg or age < 1.3 years or age >13 
years) seem to have a lower exposure whereas other groups of patients have a higher exposure. 
Nevertheless, the dosing regimen studied in the pivotal clinical trials (resulting on a lower or higher 
end of exposure) showed no relevant differences in terms of efficacy or safety outcomes. 
Below are presented the final results for the PK analysis for each study. 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
The individual AUC0-24h – time course of Type 2 or 3 SMA patients between Day 28 and the 12-month 
visit are shown for Part 1 and 2 in the Figure below.  
Part 1 was the dose finding part of the study, and therefore patients received several different dose 
levels. All PK parameters for Part 1 patients are reported in the PK-PD report. 
For the pivotal Part 2, a summary of AUC0-24h and simulated Cmax at the Month 12 visit, average 
concentration over the main 12 months treatment period (Cav) during the double-blind phase of the 
study, and observed Cmax throughout the 12 months treatment period, is presented in the Tables 
below. Only 4 patients withdrew from the study before the Month 12 visit.

BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
The individual AUC0-24h – time course of all Type 1 SMA patients between Day 28 and the Month 12 
visit are shown for the dose-finding Part 1 and the pivotal Part 2 in the Figure below. A summary of 
AUC0-24h and simulated Cmax after the risdiplam administration at the Month 12 visit, average 
concentration over the main 12 months treatment period (Cav), and observed Cmax throughout the 12 
months treatment period, for patients treated with the final selected dosing regimen of 0.2 mg/kg is 
reported in the Tables below. 
The risdiplam exposure was comparable between Parts 1 and 2, and the mean AUC0-24h at the Month 
12 visit of 1930 ng.h/mL at the selected dose of 0.2 mg/kg is compliant with the exposure target 
defined in the study protocol.   
A total of 5 patients withdrew from the study before the 12-month visit (Part 1: n=2, Part 2: n=3) and 
4 patients received 0.08 mg/kg until the 12 month visit (Part 1: n=3, Part 2: n=1). The individual 
secondary PK parameters of all Type 1 SMA patients, including these 9 patients, are reported in the

Based on study BP39055 (SUNFISH) PopPK analysis, for the total of 117 SMA patients (type 2 and type

51h (ranging from 25.4 to 107h).

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Based on results from the SAD study (Study BP29840) and mass balance study (Study no. BP39122), 
approximately 4% and 8% of risdiplam dose was renally excreted as unchanged form, respectively.  
Given that renal route is considered a minor elimination route for risdiplam and that the main 
metabolite M1 is inactive, no risk of a clinically relevant increase in exposure to risdiplam or its 
metabolite M1 in patients with renal impairment is expected. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic study in 
subjects with decreased renal function is not necessary in order to obtain adequate treatment 
recommendations. 
Moreover, and despite risdiplam is being primarily hepatically eliminated, it is also considered that a 
pharmacokinetic study in subjects with a decreased renal function is not necessary to evaluate the 
impact on the total elimination of risdiplam, as in the hepatic impairment study, mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment shown no impact on the PK of risdiplam. 
Therefore, studies to investigate the PK of risdiplam in patients with renal impairment were not 
conducted. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Given results obtained from the mass balance study, where a total of 43.1% of the dose was excreted 
on the form of metabolites in faeces and urine, the liver is considered as an important elimination 
organ for risdiplam. 
Considering that liver disease can cause alterations in drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
risdiplam and its main metabolite M1, a hepatic impairment study (Study BP40995) was conducted to 
assess whether impaired hepatic function has an impact on the exposure of risdiplam and to provide 
dosing recommendations for risdiplam in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
Study BP40995 investigated the effect of Child-Pugh mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the 
plasma PK of a single 5mg oral dose of risdiplam compared to matched healthy subjects with normal 
hepatic function. Severe hepatic impairment was not investigated. In comparison to subjects with 
normal hepatic function, risdiplam AUCinf and Cmax were approximately 20% and 5% lower in 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 8% and 20% higher in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Such differences were deemed not statistically significant. M1 metabolite ratios for 
AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax were similar between normal hepatic and mild/moderate hepatic 
impairment groups. No significant safety concerns related to the treatment have been identified. 
The proposed wording for Section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetics in special populations – Hepatic Impairment) 
of the SmPC is in line with the observed PK data. 
Gender 
In the population pharmacokinetics modelling, the effect of sex as a covariate was tested on the 
parameter CL/F, which was 15.2% higher in male than in female subjects). The sex effect as a 
covariate was considered clinically not relevant. Gender effect is not addressed in the proposed SmPC. 
Race 
The applicant has performed a Single Ascending Dose study in Japanese subjects (Study no. NP39625). 
This study was designed as an Investigator/subject-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study 
investigating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single oral doses of RO7034067 in healthy Japanese 
subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 78/293 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of risdiplam did not differ in Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Moreover, in the 
covariate analysis performed as part of the PopPK modelling for the prediction of risdiplam 
pharmacokinetics in SMA patients, Asian race was not found to be a statistically or clinically relevant 
covariate and was therefore not included in the final PK model of risdiplam. 
The proposed wording for Section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetics in special populations – Ethnicity) of the 
SmPC is in line with the observed PK data. 
Children and Weight 
In the population pharmacokinetics modelling, the time-varying body weight and age were necessary 
to describe the variability of the heterogeneous population in terms of age and body weight and 
therefore used as covariates in the final model. The dose is therefore adjusted based on age (below 
and above 2 years) and body weight (up to 20 kg) to obtain similar exposure across the age and body 
weight range. No data are available in patients less than 2 months of age. 
Elderly 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to investigate PK in patients with SMA above 60 years of 
age. Patients with SMA up to 60 years of age were included in the JEWELFISH study. Subjects without 
SMA up to 69 years of age were included in the clinical PK studies, which indicates that no dose 
adjustment is required for patients up to 69 years of age. 
Interactions 
In vitro 
In vitro studies have showed that risdiplam and its major circulating metabolite M1 did not induce 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 or 3A4 and that risdiplam and M1 did not inhibit (reversible or time 
dependent inhibition [TDI]) any of the CYP enzymes tested (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6) with 
the exception of CYP3A.  
In vitro studies have also showed that risdiplam and M1 are not a significant inhibitor of human 
multidrug resistance protein (MDR) 1, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, 
organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (OAT 1 and 3). However, it was shown that: 
•Risdiplam is an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K in vitro 
•M1 is an inhibitor of BCRP and MATE1 in vitro 
In  order  to  assess  clinical  relevance  of  in  vitro  inhibition  flags,  EMA  guideline  on  DDI  recommend 
estimating: 
•For intestinal efflux (BCRP): The drug level in the GI tract calculated as the PO dose divided by 250 mL. 
Despite M1 is a circulating metabolite, it is not detected in faeces in human. Therefore, this approach is 
not applicable for M1.  
•For hepatic efflux (BCRP) and renal uptake (OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K): The ratio of unbound plasma 
Cmax to the in vitro IC50 ([I]/IC50). 
In vivo inhibition of a transporter at a certain site can be excluded if the ratio [I]/IC50 is lower than 
0.02. Based on results shown in Table below, the only potentially clinically relevant DDI risks expected 
are linked to MATE1 and MATE2-K inhibition by risdiplam, in contrast to, for example, OCT2 inhibition 
by parent or metabolite M1 or BCRP inhibition by M1. The possible risk is related to the elimination of 
drugs that are substrates of these renal uptake transporters, and for which renal route is a primary 
route of elimination.

study: 0.25 mg/kg (body weight<20 kg) or 5 mg, BP39056 “Firefish” study: 0.2 mg/kg). 
The assessment was based on the median and maximum observed Cmax values in the “Firefish” study;

~30% (observed ratio 0.287) was assumed for calculating M1 Cmax values.

The  proposed  wording  for  Section  4.5  (Interaction  with  other  medicinal  products  and  other  forms  of 
interaction - Effects of risdiplam on other medicinal products) of the SmPC is in line with in vitro results.  
In silico 
A PBPK model was used to translate the results of Study BP41361 to the paediatric SMA patient 
population aged between 2 months to 18 years-old, and to evaluate the CYP3A inactivation risk. The 
simulations indicated a similar extent of CYP3A inactivation effect in children aged 2 months to 18 
years as observed in Study BP41361.  
Moreover, the simulations have also indicated that a CYP3A enzyme inhibition in the liver is negligible 
and the predicted increase in midazolam AUC was mostly due to intestinal CYP3A inhibition. Therefore, 
the DDI risk for intravenously administered CYP3A substrates is considered negligible. Due to the low 
degree of enzyme inactivation in the small intestine, a greater DDI risk for CYP3A substrates with 
lower intestinal availability than midazolam (FG <0.55) is not expected. For drugs with higher 
intestinal availability than midazolam, the DDI risk is negligible. 
There are no requirements to predict this interaction in paediatrics. If information from the PBPK model 
is included in the SmPC, a full qualification and validation of the paediatric PBPK model, with focus on 
this interaction is needed which seems to not have been done. Therefore, PBPK simulations are not 
necessary for this application and consequently the SmPC should not reflect these simulations. 
In vivo 
Given that in vitro studies have shown that risdiplam is primarily metabolised by flavin monooxygenase 
1 and 3 (FMO1 and FMO3), and also by CYPs 1A1, 2J2, 3A4 and 3A7, and given that itraconazole is a 
strong inhibitor of CYP3A activity in vivo, the potential inhibitory effect on the metabolism of risdiplam 
(RO7034067) was studied in an in vivo clinical study (Study no. BP29840). 
In this study, the potential interaction was assessed in a dedicated Part 3 of the Single Ascending Dose 
clinical study (Study no. BP29840). In order to minimize the number of subjects required, a within-
subject study design was chosen. Moreover, to account for uncertainties in the elimination of 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 80/293 
 
 
RO7034067 in humans, which may be prolonged by itraconazole, an open-label, one-sequence design 
was selected. 
In the in vivo study, it was shown that itraconazole co-administration was associated with a minor 
effect on the PK of a single oral dose of risdiplam: there was a slight increase in AUC0−120h 
(geometric mean ratio 1.108) and a slight decrease in Cmax (geometric mean ratio 0.906). These 
results suggest a limited contribution of the CYP3A pathway to risdiplam metabolism, and hence a 
small likelihood of clinically significant interaction with inhibitors or inducers of the CYP3A enzymes. 
In vitro studies have also showed that risdiplam and M1 did not inhibit (reversible or Time Dependent 
Inhibition) any of the CYP enzymes tested with the exception of CYP3A4, for which have shown a 
reversible and time dependent inhibition in a concentration in a concentration between 5 µM and 12.5 
µM. Therefore, as a signal for time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A by risdiplam was identified in vitro, 
an in vivo study (Study no. BP41361) was performed with a multiple-dose administration of risdiplam 
for 2 weeks as once daily (QD) dosing, as the assessment of time-dependent inhibition in vivo requires 
multiple dose administration of the perpetrator.  
Study no. BP41361 was an open-label, non-randomised, Phase 1, 2-part study to investigate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of a QD multiple-dosing regimen of risdiplam (Part 1) and the effect of 
risdiplam on the PK of midazolam (Part 2) following oral administration in healthy adult male and 
female participants.is described below regarding the potential interaction on the pharmacokinetics of 
midazolam. 
Based on the results obtained for midazolam, the ratios of the geometric least-squares mean (90% CI) 
of midazolam co-administered with risdiplam compared to midazolam alone were 1.08 (0.93, 1.26), 
1.11 (1.02, 1.20), and 1.16 (1.06, 1.28) for AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax, respectively, indicating that 
co-administration of risdiplam may have slightly increased the exposure of midazolam in healthy 
subjects. The observed magnitude of this effect is however not considered clinically relevant. 
The proposed wording for Section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction - Effects of risdiplam on other medicinal products) of the SmPC, regarding midazolam is in 
line with the results obtained in the study no. BP41361. PK assessor agrees with the recommendations 
in the absence of a need of a dose adjustment for drugs that are CYP3A substrates. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
There was no evidence of a relationship between the occurrence of AEs or SAEs and individual 
exposure (Cav) in the pivotal studies BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2 and BP39056 (FIREFISH) Part 2. 
Treatment with risdiplam was well tolerated across the entire exposure range, and the average 
risdiplam concentration (Cav) was comparable in patients experiencing AEs or SAEs versus patients not 
experiencing these events. 
2.4.2. Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Risdiplam is an oral formulation, centrally and peripherally distributed small molecule SMN2 splicing 
modifier that increases production of functional SMN protein by promoting the inclusion of exon 7 in 
SMN2 mRNA. 
The applicant proposed mechanism of action (MoA) is based on in vivo nonclinical studies (Type 1 SMA-like 
SMN∆7 mouse model) and ex vivo systems. The increase in SMN protein levels translated into efficacy in 
rescuing disease phenotype (reduction in weight loss) in mouse model. Although the exact MoA has 
not been fully elucidated experimentally, further data supports the mechanistic assumption of the 
splicing modifier specificity for SMN2 splicing of risdiplam: studies with small molecules closely related 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 81/293 
 
 
to risdiplam suggest that direct binding to two distinct sites of the SMN2 pre-mRNA increases levels of 
SMN protein and SMN mRNA; approved medicines for SMA targeting the inclusion of exon 7 in SMN2 
pre-mRNA are considered a valid therapeutic approach for SMA. This MoA is considered plausible and 
targets a specific pathway for the treatment of the disease, with similar pathophysiology across all 
ages and all SMA types, that increases the expression of a functional and stable SMN protein, 
necessary for normal motor neuron functioning.  
Animal safety studies and mechanistic investigations allowed to identify secondary splice targets, 
including FOXM1 and MADD, involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, respectively. 
Primary Pharmacology 
Primary PD was explored in in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology studies showing that an 
increase in SMN protein production translates into disease-modifying efficacy, rescuing the disease 
phenotype. Dosing of risdiplam resulted in around 2-fold increased SMN protein levels in muscle and 
brain tissues of the two SMA model mice used. Risdiplam major human metabolite (M1) was less 
potent for inducing the generation of FL SMN2 transcript in Type 1 SMA patient fibroblasts and did not 
affect SMN2 exon 7 splicing, in whole blood from healthy volunteers, supporting the claim of a 
negligible primary pharmacological effect. 
Blood levels of SMN protein and SMN2 mRNA (PD biomarkers) have been measured in all SMA patients 
in the clinical studies: BP39056 (Type 1 SMA patients, 1-7 months); BP39055      (Type 2 or Type 3 
SMA patients, 2-25 years) and BP39054 (Type 2 or Type 3 SMA patients previously treated with other 
SMA therapeutic products). 
The PD biomarker SMN protein has increased within 4 weeks after treatment start (median >2 fold-
increase at the last observation, from baseline absolute SMN protein values), and was maintained over 
the entire treatment duration, with follow-up available to date for 104 weeks (Type 2 or Type 3 SMA 
patients) and 52 weeks (Type 1 SMA patients). Baseline absolute SMN protein values were generally 
lower in Type 1 SMA patients (     See table 22), compared to Type 2 or 3 SMA , which explained the 
larger variability in SMN protein increase between these two populations . SMN protein is considered 
the biomarker of choice for SMA, as all the approved therapies are aimed to restore its expression. 
Since SMN protein is an obvious pharmacodynamic biomarker, a 2-fold increase in SMN protein versus 
baseline is predicted to lead to significant clinical benefit, based on the animal pharmacology data in 
SMA mouse models and in clinical data from the dose-finding part of the pivotal studies.  
The PD biomarker, SMN2 full-length mRNA change from baseline (%), after risdiplam oral 
administration to human was well predicted based on combined in vitro, in vivo preclinical data and 
PK/PD integrated analysis. The mode of action of risdiplam as a SMN2 splicing modifier was confirmed 
by the observed shift in SMN2 splicing (increase in full-length SMN2 mRNA and a decrease in SMN2⊗7 
mRNA). No difference in the relationship between risdiplam exposure and the shift in SMN mRNA 
splicing was seen among the SMA populations (i.e., SMA Type 1, 2 or 3 in Study BP39054, BP39055 
and BP39056), and there was no difference in response in patients previously treated with other SMA 
targeted therapies versus treatment-naïve patients. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
Data from in vitro transcriptomics assays confirmed that risdiplam has significant specificity for SMN2 
exon 7 splicing, however, a number of secondary splice targets, which all share the same 5’ splice site, 
were identified as being alternatively spliced by risdiplam: human genes FOXM1, STRN3 and 
SLC25A17. In patients, therapeutic effect in terms of shifting the splicing to inclusion of exon 7 is 
achieved at a mean exposure not exceeding the NOAEL for off-target effects observed in nonclinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 82/293 
 
 
toxicity studies. Risdiplam moved into clinical development with a mean exposure cap corresponding to 
the NOAEL for retinal toxicity in monkeys, with extensive safety monitoring. 
Regarding QTc analysis, PK-PD evaluation aimed to assess the effect of risdiplam on QTc was carried-
out throughout a ‘Change from baseline Concentration-QT response analysis’ and a ‘Time-matched 
concentration-QT response analysis’. The first analysis apparently pooled both acute and chronic ECG 
data and treatment time was not analysed as a covariate. The second analysis also included ECGs 
following repeated administration. No analysis was performed in order to assess the effect of time. 
According to the applicant, no evidence for a prolongation in QTcF was identified, since the upper limit 
of the two-sided 90%-CI of ΔQTcF did not exceed 10ms.  
Also, although no analysis of the QTc effect was performed of high (but still in the range of therapeutic 
levels) risdiplam concentrations there is no trend observable within the measured range, and there is 
no signal from the clinical safety data that would indicate a QTc prolongation in human at higher 
concentrations.  
The applicant will conduct in 2021-2022 a dedicated single-dose tQT-study in healthy adult subjects 
that is considered to be sufficient to further support current conclusions on absence of Q-T 
prolongation by risdiplam. 
Regarding plasma protein binding, based on protein binding measured in human plasma from cord 
blood, neonates and children (non-SMA and type 1, 2 and 3 SMA patients), there is no age dependency 
of risdiplam plasma protein binding. These results are in contrast to the observations in rodents where 
a higher free fraction of risdiplam was observed in young animals.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
Considering the specific target and unique MoA of risdiplam, no pharmacodynamic drug-drug 
interaction studies were performed, which may be considered acceptable. Although some data has 
been presented for PK interactions no PD interactions were mentioned and no pharmacodynamic DDIs 
are expected via other pathways, except for substrates of the MATE 1/2K transporters (PK 
interactions).  
Genetic differences in PD response 
Genotype was confirmed at baseline. All patients enrolled in the pivotal studies have been genetically 
diagnosed with SMA (SMN1 gene), carrying two SMN2 gene copies (Type 1 SMA) or higher SMN2 gene 
copies (Type 2 or Type 3 SMA). All patients responded to risdiplam, regardless of genotype and no 
obvious difference in exposure versus PD biomarkers (SMN protein and SMN mRNA) relationship was 
noted among the SMA patient populations (Type 1 vs. Type 2 or Type 3 SMA). In general, infants with 
Type 1 SMA (study BP39056) presented lower baseline absolute SMN protein values, compared with 
patients with SMA Type 2 or Type 3. In an ethnicity study in healthy Japanese subjects, PD biomarkers 
behaviour (SMN protein and SMN mRNA) in Japanese subjects matched the results observed in 
Caucasian subjects. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The proposed dosing regimen was based on the results from 4 clinical studies (BP29840, BP39054, 
BP39055, and BP39056) and simulated results from modelling PK/PD data (popPK). 
Dose selection and Dosing Regimen 
The rational for dose selection is based in: a) dose response data for survival in the mouse SMA model; 
b) the NOAEL in monkey (mean AUC 2000 ng.h/mL); c) exposure close to but not above the exposure 
Assessment report

cap (mean AUCss 2000 ng.h/mL), with at least 2-fold SMN protein increase (PD marker) at the dose 
levels at which efficacy was observed; and d) comparison of baseline SMN protein across SMA types. 
Dose levels were investigated in a staggered and dose-escalating manner in different age groups, 
assessing the exposures with body weight. In BP39055 study (SMA Type 2/3), a median SMN protein 
increase of 2.5-fold was observed with 5 mg in patients aged 12−25 years old, and a 2-fold increase 
with 0.25 mg/kg in the 2−11 years age group. Based on PPK model simulations, a dosing regimen of 5 
mg once daily (body weight ≥20 kg) and 0.25 mg/kg once daily (body weight < 20 kg) obtained an 
exposure very close to the targeted mean AUC0-24h,ss  2000 ng.h/mL: 2250 ng.h/mL (BW < 20 kg, dose 
of 0.25 mg/kg OD) and 2010 ng.h/mL (BW ε20 kg, dose 5 mg OD).Based on this data and specially on 
PK simulations (PPK model), assessing the exposures with body weight (Figure 29), the dosing 
regimen of 5 mg once daily for patients with a body weight ≥20 kg and 0.25 mg/kg once daily for 
patients with a body weight < 20 kg was selected as the pivotal dose for Part 2, where a total of 
180 non-ambulant male and female patients aged 2 to 25 years with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA (stratified 
by age) were enrolled. 
Figure 18 
The observed exposure in Part 2 confirms the dose selection approach; the selected dosing regimen 
indeed obtained an exposure very close to the targeted mean AUC0-24h,ss  2000 ng.h/mL. The mean 
AUC0-24h,ss  at the Month 12 visit in Part 2 was 2250 ng.h/mL (range 1560−3020, n=28) for patients with 
a body weight <20 kg receiving a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, and 2010 ng•h/mL (range 1060−3800, n=89) for 
patients with a body weight ≥20 kg receiving a dose of 5 mg, with an overall mean AUC0-24h,ss  of 
2070 ng.h/mL. 
In BP39056 study (SMA Type 1), IMC was responsible for dose selection/escalation and emerging PK 
data lead the dose adjustments. A median 2-fold increase in SMN protein was observed with a mean 
exposure (AUC0−24h) ≤ 1000 ng•h/mL, and a median 3.2-fold increase was obtained with an exposure 
(AUC0−24h) > 1000 ng•h/mL.  
Based on this data, a dose of 0.2 mg/kg was selected for infants ≥ 5 months of age. Limited data 
existed from 4 infants age 3−5 months in Part 1 of this study at the start of Part 2, where the 
escalation approach was a starting dose of 0.08 mg/kg for infants 3−5 months old, and 0.04 mg/kg for 
infants 1−3 months. Upon review of the PK for every infant, the dose was increased to the target 
exposure of mean AUC0−24h,ss≤ 2000 ng.h/mL per protocol, and the dose was adjusted to 0.2 mg/kg for

all infants. The mean AUC0-24h,ss for all infants enrolled at 12M was 1930 ng.h/mL at the dose of 0.2 
mg/kg. 
In Studies BP39056 (Type 1 SMA patients, 1-7 months) and BP39055 (Type 2 or Type 3 SMA patients, 
2-25 years), an at least 2-fold median increase in SMN protein was obtained within 4 weeks after start 
of treatment with risdiplam at the pivotal dose in all three studies, and this increase was maintained 
over the entire treatment duration, with follow-up available to date for more than 2 years (Figure 16 
and Figure 17).

According to Table 22 containing the SMN protein values at last observation by study, baseline 
absolute SMN protein values were generally lower in Type 1 SMA patients (Study BP39056     ), but the 
fold-increase at the last observation was comparable to Type 2 or 3 SMA patients (study BP39055     ):  
Figure 21 
Larger variability was noted in Type 1 SMA patients from study BP39056, with some infants obtaining 
greater SMN protein increase compared to Type 2 or 3 SMA patients from study BP39055, due to the 
lower baseline values in Type 1 patients.  
The  PPK  analysis  confirms  the  first  dose  selection  for  BP39055  (SUNFISH)  and  the  following  dose 
selection  for  BP39056  (FIREFISH),  to  obtain  an  exposure  of  ≤ 2000  ng.h/mL  AUC0−24h,ss  (mean).  The 
selected  dosing  regimen  achieved  similar  exposure  (Figure  15)  across  the  wide  age  and  body  weight 
range.

These exposures in SMA patients have also been stratified by age group (Figure 16). The prediction 
corrected visual predictive checks (pc-VPC) with time after the last dose stratified by age (Figure 16) 
showed consistent median between the predictions and observations in all age groups. Although minor 
deviations were seen in 2.5th or 97.5th percentiles in some of the time points, the observations were 
mostly within the respective confidence interval and prediction of central tendency and variability was 
considered acceptable. Based on the pc-VPCs, the predictive performance of the final PK model of 
risdiplam was considered satisfactory.

The role of allometric and maturation functions in description of risdiplam CL/F of the model is presented 
in Figure 12. Allometric function alone would lead to significant bias in CL/F in young children, particularly 
with body weight <10 kg. Both allometric and maturation functions were therefore required to capture 
risdiplam CL/F across the age and body weight range.

Based on all available PK, PD, safety, and efficacy data, the following regimen is recommended: 
Infants below 2 years of age receive a daily dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Infants above 2 years of age receive a 
daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg, if < 20 kg; or a dose of 5 mg/day, if ≥ 20 kg.  
The applicant proposes a chronic administration of risdiplam, based on the sustained level of functional 
SMN protein with increase levels maintained over the entire treatment duration, with follow-up 
available to date for more than 2 years (Study BP39055) and 12 months (Study BP39056). 
Treatment with risdiplam has been well tolerated so far at all dose levels and in all age groups. 
Treatment with a daily dose beyond 5 mg has not been studied. According to popPK, the selected 
dosing regimen for the first dose selection for BP39055 and BP39056 achieved similar exposure across 
the wide age and body weight range. In the model, both allometric and maturation functions were 
considered to capture risdiplam CL/F across the age and body weight range. The prediction corrected 
visual predictive checks (pc-VPC) with time after the last dose stratified by age showed consistent 
median between the predictions and observations in all age groups. The predictive performance of the 
final PK model of risdiplam can be considered satisfactory. According to the applicant no conclusive PK 
data is currently available in infants below 2 months of age (only 5 infants were enrolled to date), and 
therefore no dosing recommendation can be provided yet for these very young infants. 
Observed Exposure-Response Relationship for PD biomarkers 
An exposure-dependent response in SMN2 mRNA and SMN protein was observed in all studies in SMA 
patients. Time-matched plasma concentration of risdiplam showed strong negative correlation with 
SMN∆7 mRNA, with a maximum effect starting to be reached for concentrations above 100 ng/mL. A 
positive but less strong correlation was observed with full-length SMN2 mRNA. Patients with a 
Assessment report

risdiplam AUC0-24h of 2000 ng.h/mL (average concentration of 83 ng/mL) achieve a reduction of SMN∆7 
mRNA by 75%.  
Data from studies BP39056 (FIREFISH; Type 1 SMA patients, 1-7 months); BP39055 (SUNFISH; Type 
2 or Type 3 SMA patients, 2-25 years) and BP39054 (JEWELFISH; Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 SMA 
patients previously treated with other SMA therapeutic products), revealed that the increase in full-
length SMN2 mRNA (SMN2FL mRNA), and the corresponding decrease in SMN∆7 mRNA (depicted as 
fold change from baseline), correlates well with the time-matched plasma concentration of risdiplam 
(Figure 22 and Figure 23 below, from Population PK Analyses Report for Risdiplam). 
Figure 26 
Figure 27 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021

According  to  the  applicant,  the  almost  complete  depletion  of ∆7  mRNA  at  the  highest  concentrations 
indicates that although the plateau of the PD response has not been reached completely, the effect at 
the selected dose levels are not far from the maximum possible effect (shift in mRNA splicing) for almost 
complete depletion of SMN∆7 mRNA. 
Exposure-dependent linear (AUC0-24h) increase in absolute SMN protein was observed in all SMA types, 
with  similar  increase  between  treatment  naïve  and  previously  treated  Type  2/3  SMA  patients  and  a 
comparable  median  SMN  protein  at  the  last  observation.  Absolute  and  change  from  baseline  of  SMN 
protein were slightly higher with AUC0-24 > 2000 ng·h/mL in all patients (Type 1-3). Absolute SMN protein 
values were generally lower in Type 1 SMA patients (greater variability was noted with several infants 
obtaining a 4-8-fold increase SMN protein), but the fold-increase at the last observation was comparable 
to Type 2/3 SMA patients. 
Comparable  PK-PD  relationship  was  seen  between  treatment-naïve  patients  from  studies  BP39056      
(Type 1 SMA) and BP39055 (Type 2 or Type 3 SMA), according to Population PK analysis (Figure 20): 
Figure 28 
Comparable PK-PD relationship was also seen between Type 2 or 3 SMA treatment-naïve patients, 
from study BP39055 and previously treated patients with currently approved SMA therapies, from 
study BP39054 (Figure 21 below, from Population PK Analyses Report for Risdiplam):

Efficacy - Exposure Response Analysis 
There was no clear correlation between risdiplam individual exposure (Cav, average concentration over 
the treatment period of 12 months) and efficacy outcomes in Part 2 of studies BP39056 and BP39055.  
Safety - Exposure Response Analysis 
There was no signal of a relationship between the occurrence of (serious) adverse events and 
individual exposure (Cav) of patients in Part 2 of studies BP39056 and BP39055. Average risdiplam 
concentration (Cav) was comparable in patients experiencing adverse events or serious adverse events 
versus patients not experiencing these events. 
2.4.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK profile of risdiplam was sufficiently characterised in healthy subjects through single- and 
multiple-dose, ADME, DDI, hepatic impairment completed studies and in SMA patients through three 
ongoing studies and a PPK model. No major issues have been identified. Several concerns were 
identified and further discussion was provided by the applicant. Clarification with respect to validation 
and bioanalytical reports, were provided. The expected bioavailability was also clarified. Only a limited 
available data for a food effect conclusion (derived from Study BP29840) is available. The clinical 
studies in SMA patients were conducted with the recommendation to take risdiplam with the morning 
meal. Therefore, the applicant proposes to update the SmPC to indicate that risdiplam shall be taken 
with a meal, as done during the clinical studies. Clarifications on the distribution and binding with red 
blood cells and metabolites’ profile were satisfactory. Discussion of data on mean half-life and renal 
clearance, also in terms of risdiplam Ctrough results to better elucidate the time the steady state is 
attained both in healthy subjects and SMA patients, along with DDI interactions with CYP3A4 and 
posology was provided and no further issues require clarification in this regard.

Pharmacodynamics 
In general the pharmacodynamics of risdiplam have been sufficiently evaluated. No major issues have 
been identified and all the concerns previously raised have been adequately addressed.  
2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
From a clinical pharmacokinetics point of view, all aspects raised during the assessment have been 
adequately addressed. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Clinical  pharmacodynamics  of  risdiplam  have  been  sufficiently  evaluated  and  the  data  presented  is 
adequate to support a positive opinion from a pharmacodynamics point of view. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
●  The applicant will conduct in 2021-2022 a dedicated single-dose tQT-study in healthy adult 
subjects to support the conclusions on absence of Q-T prolongation by risdiplam.

Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) is a study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and 
PK/PD of risdiplam in pre-symptomatic infants from birth to 6 weeks who were genetically diagnosed 
with SMA. Recruitment is ongoing; up to 15 January 2020, 4 patients had been enrolled. Due to the 
current small number of patients and limited data from this ongoing study, efficacy results from Study 
BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) are not yet available. 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Both pivotal studies Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) and BP39055 (SUNFISH) shared a Part 1 which was 
designed to provide a dose-response and proof of concept insight. Study designs are shown in main 
studies. 
2.5.1.  Dose-response studies 
Type 1 SMA 
Part 1 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) was designed as the initial dose-finding part to assess safety, PK, 
and PD of risdiplam. Efficacy measures were included in Part 1 and were exploratory (CCOD: 27 
February 2019). 
Both Parts 1 and 2 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) share the same inclusion/exclusion criteria, enrolling 
symptomatic infants with well-established Type 1 SMA at baseline; however, the 21 patients enrolled 
in Part 1 were not rolled over to Part 2. Therefore, Parts 1 and 2 can be considered as two independent 
studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 95/293 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No hypothesis testing was performed for Part 1; however, the benchmarks (performance criteria) that 
were derived for the Part 2 analysis, as documented in the Part 2 SAP for Study BP39056 (FIREFISH), 
were used for exploratory comparisons of Part 1 data. A similar level of confidence would be achieved 
in Part 1 if at least 4 out of 21 infants (19.0% [90% CI: 6.8%-38.4%]) are sitting without support 
after 12 months of treatment. Based on this number, the lower limit of the 90% CI would be above 
5%. 
Study Population 
A total of 21 patients with Type 1 SMA were enrolled into Part 1 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) across 7 
different sites in 5 countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States). At the time 
of the CCOD (27 February 2019), 18 of 21 patients (85.7%) in Part 1 were still on study; these 18 
patients were older than 16 months of age. Three patients (14.3%) had died due to SMA-related 
respiratory complications; of these, two died before Month 12 (on Day 21 and Day 236) and one died 
after Month 12 (on Day 387). 
All patients received treatment with risdiplam. Two cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2) were defined based on 
the target exposure specified in the protocol, respectively, for Dose Levels 1 and 2. 
Per protocol, the first 4 infants enrolled into the study had to remain at Dose Level 1 at the low target 
exposure of mean AUC0-24h,ss 700 ng.h/mL. Per protocol, the dose of the 5th patient enrolled was 
foreseen to be increased to the higher dose level. However, the 5th patient died due to disease-related 
complications approximately 3 weeks after enrolment into the study, and therefore the dose of the 4th 
patient was increased instead. As no dose-escalation stopping rules were met after administration of 
risdiplam in all 5 enrolled patients (for a minimum of 1 week in the one infant receiving Dose Level 2, 
and longer treatment duration in all previously enrolled infants at Dose Level 1), 3 additional patients 
were enrolled and received risdiplam at this higher target exposure of mean AUC0-24h,ss ≤2000 
ng·h/mL (Dose Level 2). The protocol specified that further patients (up to a maximum total of 24 
patients) could be enrolled in Part 1 to enable the dose selection for Part 2. Therefore, after enrolment 
of the minimum 8 patients described above, a further 13 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 2 (target 
exposure of mean AUC0-24h,ss ≤2000 ng·h/mL), giving a total number of 21 patients in Part 1 of the 
study. 
The dose administered in Cohort 2 was the same as the pivotal dose used in Part 2 of the study (target 
exposure of mean AUC0- 24h,ss ≤2000 ng·h/mL), after some initial dose adjustments. 
The dose-selection in Part 1 targeted the following: 
Starting dose: The first patient was to receive a single dose of 0.00106 mg/kg risdiplam. This dose 
was predicted to result in an exposure (AUCinf) at least 10-fold below the target exposure of AUC0-
24h,ss 700 ng·h/mL (AUC of free fraction: 77 ng.h/mL) for Dose Level 1. This dose was selected based 
on the most conservative PBPK modelling scenario, plus an additionally applied safety factor of 10. 
Dose Level 1: Target exposure of mean AUC0-24h,ss 700 ng·h/mL; an exposure predicted to result in 
a doubling of SMN protein levels (i.e., a 2-fold increase versus the patient’s baseline). The actual dose 
to achieve this target exposure was calculated based on the PK data obtained. 
Dose Level 2: Target exposure of mean AUC0-24,ss ≤2000 ng·h/mL, i.e., a higher exposure than 
Dose Level 1, leading to the maximum possible SMN protein increase, but not above the exposure cap 
of an AUC0-24,ss of 2000 ng·h/mL (mean), which corresponds to the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) from the animal toxicology studies. 
PK monitoring was conducted per protocol in this dose-finding part of the study, and the dose was 
adjusted throughout Part 1 of the study based on the emerging data. Many patients therefore changed 
dose during the study. Of the 21 patients enrolled in Part 1 of the study at 7 sites in 5 countries, 15

(71.4%) were female and 6 (28.6%) were male. At enrolment, the median age of all patients was 6.7 
months, thus on the older end of the permitted age (range: 3.3-6.9 months); 15 of 21 patients 
(71.4%) were older than 5 months. The median age at diagnosis was 3.0 months (range: 0.9-5.4 
months) and the median age at onset of symptoms was 2 months (range 0.9 - 3.0 months). 
In accordance with the inclusion criteria, all patients had a genetic confirmation of Type 1 SMA (SMN1) 
and had two SMN2 gene copies. 
At baseline, the median BSID-III Gross Motor Scale score was 2.0 (range: 0.0-4.0), the median CHOP-
INTEND score was 24.0 points (range 10.0-34.0), the median HINE-2 score was 1.0 point (range 0.0-
3.0), and the median baseline CMAP amplitude was 0.2 mV (range: 0.0-0.6), confirming all enrolled 
patients had well-established Type 1 SMA disease at the time of study enrolment. The median time 
between the onset of symptoms and first treatment was 4.0 months (range: 2.0 - 5.8 months). 
At the CCOD of 27 February 2019, patients enrolled in Part 1 had been treated for a median of 14.8 
months (range: 0.6-26.0 months), and 19 of 21 patients had at least 12 months of treatment on 
risdiplam.

Subgroup (ITT Patients; Part 1 Patients) 
In Part 1 of the interim summary for FIREFISH Study only 4 infants aged 3.3-5 months were enrolled, 
with higher exposure observed in 3 of these infants, and no data were available in infants < 3 months. 
Later onset SMA: Type 2 and 3 
SUNFISH study consists of two parts: an exploratory dose-finding part (Part 1) and a confirmatory 
part (Part 2), starting once the dose was selected in Part 1. The two parts of the study are 
independent, have their own objectives and eligibility criteria, and have been analysed separately. 
Patients in Part 1 did not roll over into Part 2 of the study. 
SUNFISH Exploratory Part 1 
Key inclusion criteria: Type 2 or ambulatory and non-ambulatory Type 3 SMA, with confirmed genetic 
diagnosis of 5q autosomal recessive SMA. 
Key exclusion criteria were previous participation in an SMN2-targeting study or gene  therapy study 
and planned (within 18 months) or previous (<1 year prior) surgery for scoliosis or hip fixation. 
First Patient Enrolled in Part 1: 19 Oct 2016; Last Patient Enrolled in Part 1: 06 Jul 2017  
Clinical cut-off date (CCOD): 09 Jan 2019 (when all patients in Part 1 had been treated with risdiplam 
for at least 12 months). 
The objectives of Part 1 are: 
- To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in patients 
with Type 2 and Type 3 (ambulant or non-ambulant) SMA, and to select the dose for Part 2 of the 
study. 
- To investigate the PK/PD relationship of risdiplam by PK/PD modeling 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 100/293 
 
 
 
- To explore the effect of risdiplam on motor function, respiratory function, and pre-specified adverse 
events and patient-reported QOL measures. 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Part 1 (2:1 active placebo): minimum of 36 (planned); 51 (actual) (35 
initially to risdiplam; 16 to placebo) 
DOSE: Part 1 initial doses: 0.02, 0.05, 0.25 mg/kg (2-11 year old patients), and 3 and 5 mg (12-25 
year old patients). Patients in Part 1 switched to the pivotal dose after the dose selection decision: 5 
mg (BW ≥20 kg) and 0.25 mg/kg (BW <20 kg). Oral, once daily administration. 
Rationale for Dosage Selection:  
Two target exposure levels (‘Dose Levels’) were planned to be tested in Part 1 of the study and 
evaluated to select the most appropriate dose for Part 2 of the study (pivotal dose). 
- Dose Level 1: Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling using available 
data in healthy subjects and taking into account the tissue distribution and different body weight and 
body composition in SMA patients compared with healthy subjects, an oral dose of 3 mg once daily was 
selected for Dose Level 1 and was administered to Group A (patients aged 12-25 years at age of 
randomisation) who were initially enrolled into this study. The dose of 3 mg was predicted to result in 
an AUC0-24h,ss of 700 ng · h/mL in SMA patients aged 12-25 years, which is approximately 3-fold 
(2.8) below the specified exposure cap and was anticipated to result in the targeted 2-fold SMN protein 
increase. This dose and exposure were anticipated to be safe and well-tolerated based on the single 
ascending dose data obtained in healthy subjects (single-dose administration of up to 18 mg) and the 
animal toxicology studies. 
The PK data obtained from Group A were used to update the PBPK model to select a dose for the 
younger children in Group B. Once 3 adolescent patients (aged 12-17 years at age of randomisation) 
completed 4 weeks of treatment with 3 mg risdiplam, all safety, PK, and PD data were assessed. If 
safety and tolerability, PK and PD, were judged to be acceptable, Group B (children aged 2-11 years at 
age of randomisation) were to be enrolled. This dose for the Group B was likely to be a body weight-
based dosing regimen, and the aim was to achieve the same exposure as observed for Group A with 
the 3 mg dose. 
- Dose Level 2: a higher exposure, leading to the maximum possible SMN protein increase (provided 
all clinical and non-clinical safety data support this), which was predicted to provide greater benefit 
based on nonclinical data as well as published clinical data with the antisense oligonucleotide 
nusinersen. The highest possible SMN protein increase was assumed to be 3-fold, based on in vivo 
studies and in vitro cell culture data with SMA patient fibroblasts and motor neurons. Modelling 
predicted that this SMN protein increase may be reached at an exposure not exceeding the mean 
exposure cap of 2000 ng · h/mL AUC0-24h,ss. Under no circumstances was a dose to be selected that 
would lead to an exposure above a mean AUC0-24h,ss of 2000 ng · h/mL or a mean Cmax of 400 
ng/mL. 
In line with this dose selection approach based on SMN protein increase and PK data , and based on 
nonclinical data not showing new toxicities (beside retinal findings) beyond a few weeks of treatment, 
4 weeks of treatment appeared sufficient to reach PK steady state and to assess acute safety and 
tolerability of the respective dose levels and make dose decisions (dose escalation in Part 1 and 
selection of the pivotal dose level). 
Considering the study design and pace of enrolment, at these decision points patients enrolled first had 
longer treatment durations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 101/293 
 
 
Patients in the age-range included in this study are expected to have a similar free-fraction of the 
study drug as adult individuals. However, to ensure patients’ safety, for all patients in Part 1, a blood 
sample was taken at screening to assess in vitro the plasma protein binding and free-fraction of the 
study drug to confirm this assumption. The obtained measured free fraction was taken into account for 
the dose-selection in the individual patients, i.e., in case it deviated from the values in adult patients, 
the dose could be adjusted to target the selected exposure in terms of the free-fraction exposure of 
older patients. 
Table 18 - Part 1: Summary of Age Groups and Dose Cohorts (Initially Assigned Dose) 
BLINDING: For the exploratory Part 1 of this study, the Sponsor was unblinded (in a restricted 
manner) to patient treatment assignment to enable the IMC to review the data in order to make dose-
escalation decisions and determine the dose for Part 2 of the study. 
PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: The target sample size for Part 1 was based not on statistical calculation 
but on practical consideration in order to select the dose level for Part 2 of the study. The target 
sample size for Part 1 was 36 patients with the plan to enroll, in total, 4 cohorts of 9 patients 
(randomised as 6 active vs 3 placebo), with 2 cohorts in each of the two age groups of 2-11 and 12-25 
years. Up to 36 additional patients could be enrolled, for a maximum total of 72 patients enrolled in 
Part 1. With 6 patients on active treatment in each dose level cohort, there was a 74% chance to 
detect an AE in at least 1 patient, given that the true underlying AE rate was 20%. With 12 patients 
receiving active drug per dose/exposure level, this chance increased to 93%. 
EFFICACY OUTCOMES: The main exploratory efficacy outcomes measures for Part 1 were: 
- Motor Function:  Motor Function Measure-32 item version (MFM32); Hammersmith Functional Motor 
Scale-Expanded (HFMSE); Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) 
The MFM32 is a 32-item ordinal assessment classified into three domains [Domain 1: Standing, 
transfers and ambulation); Domain 2: Axial and proximal motor function in supine and sitting position 
(3/12 items evaluate arm function with the patient seated on a chair); Domain 3: Distal motor 
function] on a 4-point Likert scale based on the patient’s maximal abilities without assistance (0-96, 
higher scores indicate motor function). The MFM32 has been validated for measuring motor function in 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 102/293 
 
 
 
patients with neuromuscular diseases, including SMA (Bérard et al. 2005; Vuillerot et al. 2013; 
Trundell et al. 2019). 
The 32 scores are summed and then transformed onto a 0-100 scale (i.e., sum of 32 items scores 
divided by 96 and multiplied by 100) to yield the MFM32 total score expressed as a percentage of the 
maximum score possible for the scale. The lower the total score, the more severe the functional 
impairment. 
Although a shorter version of the MFM (the 20-item MFM [MFM20]) has been previously used in 
children younger than 7 years, the 12 excluded items assess functions important for daily life. 
Please refer to Part 2 Outcome section for the description of Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-
Expanded (HFMSE); Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) 
- Respiratory:  Forced vital capacity (FVC) 
STATISTICAL METHODS: Exploratory efficacy analyses (except disease related AEs) are mainly 
based on the all exposure to risdiplam treatment period using an adjusted baseline (defined as the last 
measurement prior to the first dose of risdiplam treatment at any dose). Efficacy data are summarised 
descriptively by time point and patient age group (2-11 and 12-25 years). 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted on MFM analyses:  
-summarised by age group of 2- 11 and 12- 25 years, and total for all patients, on the full 32 items 
scale (MFM32 scores) by excluding patients who performed the MFM20 scale at any time point as 
confirmed by a protocol deviation; 
- MFM analyses on the 20-item scale (MFM20 scores) for those patients who performed the MFM20 
scale as confirmed by a protocol deviation, at any time point. 
Subgroup Analyses 
The consistency of the efficacy endpoints for MFM32, HFMSE and RULM were explored for the following 
subgroups for the all exposure to risdiplam treatment period: 
- Age group (2-5, 6-11, 12-17, and 18-25 years at randomisation). 
- SMA type and ambulatory status (SMA Type 2, SMA Type 3 ambulant, SMA Type 3 non-ambulant) 
- SMN2 Copy number  
In addition, the change from adjusted baseline in the MFM32 total score at Month 12 was explored by 
investigational site for the all exposure to risdiplam treatment period. Sites with less than 5 patients 
enrolled were pooled for analysis. 
Changes to Planned Analyses after Database Lock  - MFM20 Performed Instead of MFM32 
Per protocol, all patients should have completed the MFM32 at all visits. However, as described in 
Section 5.4 (Protocol Deviations), for 7 patients aged 4-5 years, the MFM20 was administered in error 
at baseline and some subsequent visits up to Week 35: 
- 7 patients: MFM20 was performed at baseline 
- 3 patients: MFM20 was performed at baseline and Week 17 
- 1 patient: MFM20 was performed at baseline, Week 17 and Week 35 
In accordance with the MFM scoring manual, the missing 12 items at these visits were imputed as 0 
leading to bias in the primary analysis method (i.e., at Month 12, the actual MFM32 scores are 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 103/293 
 
 
assessed and therefore the missing 12 items for these patients at baseline could only show an 
improvement post-baseline). To remove any such bias, a sensitivity analysis on the MFM32 was 
already planned excluding patients who performed the MFM20 scale at any time point as confirmed by 
a protocol deviation. The results excluding patients who performed the MFM20 at any time point are 
considered to show the true treatment effect of risdiplam and therefore additional analyses based on 
this population were conducted as described below. 
- Waterfall plots of individual change from adjusted baseline in the MFM32 total score at Month 12 
(excluding patients who performed MFM20 at any time point) plotted with x-axis by ascending values 
of 1) age, 2) total MFM32 score at adjusted baseline and 3) duration of disease prior to first risdiplam 
treatment in months. 
- Subgroup analysis based on MFM32 excluding patients who performed MFM20 at any time point. 
- MFM32 domain score analysis excluding patients who performed MFM20 at any time point. 
The focus of the efficacy results and conclusions are based on the sensitivity analysis method (i.e., 
MFM32 scores excluding patients who performed MFM20 at any time point). 
Addendum CSR SUNFISH:  Changes in Conduct of Study or Planned Analyses 
●  For safety reporting in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH), when a patient had multiple records within 
the same visit window, the “last” record was used for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 
ECGs, and ophthalmology data and was reported as such in the interim CSR. This approach is 
correct, but deviates from the Study BP39055 Part 1 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which 
states, due to a typographical error, that the “worst” record will be selected for the summary 
of the data. 
● 
In the responder analyses of MFM, HFMSE and RULM the number of patients with an 
assessment at the respective timepoint was used to calculate the percentage of responders. 
This deviated from the SAP, which stated that patients who withdrew or had missing values 
would be treated as non-responders. 
METHODS: In Part 1, 51 patients were enrolled in five cohorts in a staggered dose escalating design. 
Patients were randomised to either placebo or risdiplam at initially assigned doses of 0.02, 0.05 and 
0.25 mg/kg for the age group of 2-11 years, and 3 and 5 mg for the age group of 12-25 years. After 
patients in Part 1 completed the minimum 12-week double-blind treatment period, patients on placebo 
were switched to risdiplam at the dose tested in their cohort until the Independent Monitoring 
Committee selected the dose for Part 2 (triggered by data availability from the last cohort enrolled). 
Patients initially on placebo had to complete the scheduled visit at Week 17 prior to switching and then 
followed the Schedule of Assessments starting again at Day 1. 
After selection of the pivotal dose, all patients in Part 1 were switched to the pivotal dose to complete 
24 months of treatment (pivotal dose ≥2 years: 5 mg once daily for patients with body weight ≥20 kg 
and 0.25 mg/kg once daily for patients with body weight <20 kg. 
After completion of the 24-month treatment period, the patient will be given the opportunity to enter 
the open-label extension (OLE) phase of the study, which will include regular monitoring of safety, 
tolerability and efficacy. Unless the development of the drug is stopped, the patient's treatment in the 
OLE may continue for an additional 3 years (i.e., patients will be treated for a total duration of at least 
5 years). Thereafter, treatment will continue until the drug is available commercially in the patient’s 
country. The treatment with study medication in the extension phase will continue as per the main 
study with regards to dosing.

As a consequence of the study design, out of the 51 in Part 1: 
- 14 patients have been treated at the selected pivotal dose from study start 
- 21 patients have been on active treatment from study start, initially receiving a lower dose of 
risdiplam 
- 16 patients received placebo for at least 17 weeks prior to switching to active treatment, either on a 
lower dose of risdiplam initially (10 patients) or straight to the pivotal dose (6 patients). 
STUDY POPULATION: Part 1 involved 5 investigational sites across 4 countries (Italy [2], Germany 
[1], France [1], Belgium [1]). 
51 patients (37 [73%] with Type 2, and 14 [27%] with Type 3 SMA) were enrolled. Overall, 27 
patients (52.9%) were female. At screening, the median age of all patients was 7.0 years (range: 2-24 
years); 20 patients (39.2%) were 12 years or older. The proportion of Type 2 SMA patients was similar 
across the two age groups (2-11 and 12-25 years), and the majority of patients were non-ambulatory 
(86.3%). Twenty-nine patients (60%) had scoliosis at screening, including 6 patients with severe 
scoliosis.

RESULTS: PART 1 DOSE SELECTION 
The dose for Part 2 was selected by the IMC based on the results obtained from Part 1, and was a dose 
that: 
- Was judged to be safe and well-tolerated, based on all available safety data from Part 1 and as 
confirmed by the iDMC. 
- Resulted in an exposure at steady-state below the exposure cap (mean value) of AUC0-24h,ss 2000 
ng · h/mL (adjusted for free-fraction, if required). 
- Resulted in an SMN protein increase that is expected to be clinically relevant. 
Overall, the approach was to target the highest SMN protein increase that could be achieved with 
risdiplam; however, the shape of the PK/PD curve was taken into account to determine the most 
appropriate target exposure (and therefore, dose), considering safety and tolerability data across 
exposure levels in Part 1 and a pre-defined exposure cap threshold. 
Based on review of all available PK, PD, safety, and tolerability data when the last patient of the last 
cohort in Part 1 reached 4 weeks of treatment, the IMC selected the dose to be administered in Part 2 
of the study as 5 mg once daily for patients with BW ≥20 kg and 0.25 mg/kg once daily for patients 
with BW <20 kg. This dose was expected to lead to a mean exposure (AUC0-24h,ss) of 1690 ng·h/mL 
[95% CI 1600-1780 ng·h/mL] across all patients 2-25 years of age, and was not expected to 
significantly exceed the exposure cap for any age or BW category.

The iDMC reviewed all available Part 1 data and confirmed the dose selected by the IMC. The final 
decision based on the iDMC recommendation was made by the Sponsor.

Updated efficacy data of risdiplam in SUNFISH Part 1, based on a clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 15 Jan 
2020, when all patients in Part 1 had been treated with risdiplam at the pivotal dose for at least 24 
months are described in the “Supportive Studies” Section.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies)  
Two pivotal studies support the application: one in infantile-onset SMA - Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
Part 2- and the other in late onset SMA - Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2. 
Part 1 of FIREFISH trial and Part 1 of SUNFISH trial provide supportive evidence of efficacy. 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) is an ongoing open-label single-arm study in infants with genetically 
confirmed Type 1 SMA. The study inclusion criteria allowed the characterisation of the effects of 
risdiplam treatment in infantile-onset SMA. The enrolment criteria selected infants with two SMN2 
copies and early onset of SMA symptoms, ensuring only patients with symptoms and diagnosis of Type 
1 SMA disease at baseline were recruited, warranting the most representative patient population for 
the assessment of risdiplam benefits in infants living with SMA. 
A comparator placebo group was not included in Study BP39056 (FIREFISH), given the rapid decline of 
the disease. At the time of study start there were no approved disease modifying therapies, which 
precluded an active comparator arm. Instead, the MAA has used a natural history source, with similar 
population, to define thresholds of achievement. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 111/293 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint for Part 2 (sitting unassisted) can be objectively measured. Sitting without 
support is never achieved in untreated patients with Type 1 SMA, thus developing this motor milestone 
would clearly diverge from the natural disease course of infantile-onset SMA. 
Other relevant outcomes have been assessed, namely overall survival, for young infants diagnosed 
with infantile-onset SMA. In addition, the effect of risdiplam therapy was assessed in a combined 
endpoint: the survival rates of affected infants and the ability to breathe without chronic ventilatory 
support (proportion of infants who are alive without permanent ventilation), two severe complications 
of Type 1 SMA. Risdiplam efficacy was supported by assessments of further clinical outcomes, such as 
the maintenance of the swallowing function and the ability to feed orally, and further gains in motor 
milestones and motor function. 
The scales used in this trial to assess further motor milestone development (Hammersmith Infant 
Neurological Examination Module 2 [HINE-2]) and motor function development (Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders [CHOP-INTEND]) are the most widely used and 
well-known scales for the assessment of changes in Type 1 SMA in both clinical practice and clinical 
research, including clinical trials. 
In terms of GCP conduct, it was noted that study BP39056 report did not clarify how corrective and 
preventive measures were implemented to mitigate the critical finding in GCP conduct, and whether 
these have been adequately transmitted across the study investigator community. (FIREFISH GCP 
aspects). The applicant has forwarded detailed measures implemented for correction and to prevent 
repetition of the findings. 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) was designed to include a broad sample of patients with Type 2 and non-
ambulant type 3 SMA, representative both in age and disability status of patients seen in clinical 
practice. Consequently, recruited patients had a wide range of disease duration at the time of 
enrolment, and experienced different degrees of SMA-related complications such as severe scoliosis, 
muscle weakness and joint contractures. A more narrow study population focusing, for example, on 
young patients only would have allowed a more homogeneous and easier assessment of efficacy (as 
size and type of treatment effects may vary by age) and could lead to a higher chance for the study to 
be successful. On the other hand, however, the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in Study BP39055 
(SUNFISH) allowed characterisation of the effects of treatment with risdiplam on the most prevalent 
SMA patient population: children, teenagers and adults living with Type 2 and non-ambulant type 3 
SMA, representative of the broad clinical spectrum of the disease. 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) enrolled adults up to 25 years of age. Patients with disease onset at 
adulthood (such as Type 4) were not included in this study. Type 4 SMA is a very rare type of the 
disease and enrolment of a sufficient number of patients would have been challenging to achieve in a 
timely manner. In addition, the majority of Type 4 patients are stronger and their disease progresses 
much more slowly as compared to other SMA types.  
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2 was designed based on two sets of data: a longitudinal, 
retrospective, natural history study of Type 2 and 3 SMA patients where the MFM was used to monitor 
disease progression (Vuillerot et al. 2013) and the data from the placebo control arm of Study 
WN29836 (a Phase II SMA study for a discontinued development compound, olesoxime), including 
Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 patients. Both sources of data helped to determine the treatment 
effect of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) as they assessed a population of similar SMA type and age range. 
After consideration of all options, including the rare nature of the disease and limited patient pool 
available, Roche decided to power the trial for a 3-point difference leading to a trial size still feasible in 
the SMA population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 112/293 
 
 
Independence and the ability to perform basic personal tasks have been described as a priority by 
Type 2 and 3 SMA patients. Existing outcome measures (e.g., Generic Paediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory and Neuromuscular modules) lack specificity to SMA. The MAA developed a new tool – the 
SMA Independence Scale (SMAIS) - which has been validated along the development plan.

Methods 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) is being conducted in two parts, both with a treatment period of 24 months 
followed by an open-label extension (OLE) phase (see Figure 1). 
Figure 33 - Study Design of Parts 1 and 2 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
*The first infant enrolled received a single dose of risdiplam. Approximately 6 weeks later, as per the Schedule of 
Assessments, the patient started administration of once daily risdiplam at a dose that was selected based on the 
PK data obtained from the first single dose, targeting the exposure specified for Dose Level 1 (AUC0-24h,ss 700 
ng h/mL).  
† Cohort 1 includes the first three infants enrolled in the study (including the first infant who received an initial 
single dose of risdiplam) who all received Dose Level 1 for at least 12 months and the infant enrolled at Dose 
Level 1 who discontinued from the study on Study Day 19.  
‡ Cohort 2 includes the infant enrolled at Dose Level 1 whose dose was escalated to Dose Level 2 on Study Day 83 
and all other infants enrolled at Dose Level 2. 
The primary analysis of Part 2 was performed at Month 12 of the active treatment phase. The Part 2 
active treatment phase is ongoing in order to continue to assess the efficacy of risdiplam at the pivotal 
dose through Month 24, after which patients can enter the OLE phase.

SMA diagnosis 
Confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA, including: 
a. Genetic confirmation of homozygous deletion or compound heterozygosity predictive 
of loss of function of the SMN1 gene. 
b. Clinical history, signs or symptoms attributable to Type 1 SMA with onset after the 
age of 28 days, but prior to the age of 3 months (inclusive), and inability to sit 
independently (without support) at the time of screening. 
SMN2 copy number 
Infant has two SMN2 gene copies, as confirmed by central testing. 
Respiratory status 
If not already in place at the time of screening, parent or caregiver of infant is willing to 
consider the use of non-invasive ventilation during the study, as recommended by the 
Key Exclusion Criteria 
Investigator.  
Respiratory status, recent 
Patients who required invasive ventilation or tracheostomy, have a hypoxemia without 
hospitalisation, conditions 
ventilation support, had required hospitalisation for a pulmonary event within the last 2 
months, and/or have a presence of non-SMA related comorbidities. 
Concomitant medication  
Concomitant or previous administration of a SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide, 
SMN2 splicing modifier, or gene therapy, either in a clinical study or as part of medical 
care. 
SMA=spinal muscular atrophy; SMN1=survival of motor neuron 1 gene; SMN2=survival of motor neuron 
2 gene. 
Other exclusion criteria:  
Recently initiated treatment (within < 6 weeks prior to enrollment) with oral salbutamol or another 
beta2-adrenergic agonist taken orally was not allowed. Infants who had been on oral salbutamol (or 
another beta2-adrenergic agonist) for ≥ 6 weeks before screening and had shown good tolerance were 
allowed. The dose of beta2-adrenergic agonist was to remain stable as much as possible for the 
duration of the study. Use of inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., for the treatment of asthma) was 
allowed. 
Prior use (at any time in the patients’ lives) and/or anticipated need for quinolines (chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine), thioridazine, vigabatrin, retigabine, or any other drug known to cause retinal 
toxicity during the study did not allow participation in the trial. Infants exposed to chloroquine, 
hydroxycholoroquine, thioridazine, vigabatrin, retigabine or drugs with known retinal toxicity given to 
mothers during pregnancy (and lactation) were not to be enrolled. 
Recent history (less than 6 months) of ophthalmic diseases (e.g., glaucoma not controlled by 
treatment, central serous retinopathy, inflammatory/infectious retinitis unless clearly inactive, retinal 
detachment, intraocular trauma, retinal dystrophy or degeneration, optic neuropathy, or optic neuritis) 
that would have interfered with the conduct of the study as assessed by an ophthalmologist. Any other 
abnormalities detected with optical coherence tomography (OCT) at screening (e.g., retinal layer 
Assessment report

abnormalities, oedema, cystic or atrophic changes) were to be discussed with the Investigator, 
Ophthalmologist, and with the Sponsor, who jointly made the decision on whether the infant could be 
enrolled in the study. Infants in whom OCT measurement of sufficient quality could not be obtained at 
screening were not enrolled. 
Investigation sites: 
Part 1: 7 sites across 5 countries (Belgium [1], France [1], Italy [2], Switzerland [1], and the United 
States [2]). Part 2: 14 sites across 10 countries (Croatia [1], France [1], Italy [4], Poland [1], Russia

interferon, or any other drugs known to cause retinal toxicity. 
Prohibited Foods 
Subjects were to avoid grapefruit juice and Seville orange (juice) starting at least 2 weeks prior to 
study drug administration. 
Safety stopping rules 
The following specific safety stopping rules for an individual subject were defined a priori: 
●  Skin or subcutaneous reaction, pharyngeal/laryngeal or mucosal reaction (Grade >=2 CTCAE 
v4.03) considered to be clearly related to study drug as confirmed by a Dermatologist/Ear, 
Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist, making the benefit-risk ratio non-favorable. 
●  Functional or structural eye abnormalities. 
●  Significant and clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters, ECG, or vital signs 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 115/293 
 
 
●  Any elevated ALT of >3 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) < 2 x ULN, and associated with an 
increase in bilirubin (>= 2 x upper limit of normal) 
●  Other findings such as a SAE or any other severe AE that, at the joint discretion of Roche TML, 
Roche Safety Science Leader, and the Investigator, indicate that dosing should be halted. 
Treatments 
Study medication (risdiplam) was taken orally once daily. Patients who were breastfed were to be fed 
prior to dosing, winded (i.e., maneuvered to release air from stomach), and then study medication was 
to be administered. For patients able to swallow, study drug was administered with a syringe inserted 
between baby's gum and cheek. Thereafter, water (approximately 10-20 mL) was to be administered 
with a baby’s bottle to prevent prolonged contact of study drug with buccal mucosa. Similarly, the 
peribuccal area of the infant was to be washed with water, in case of drug drooling or spitting. 
Breastfeeding was to be avoided within 1 hour after risdiplam administration, and women were advised 
to rinse their breasts with water if breastfeeding occurred shortly (<1 hour) after risdiplam 
administration. This is being added to SmPC: “Method of administration (...): Evrysdi is taken orally 
once a day after a meal at approximately the same time each day, using the re-usable oral syringe 
provided. In infants who are breastfed, EVRYSDI should be administered after breastfeeding. Evrysdi 
should not be mixed with milk or formula milk.” 
Patients who were unable to swallow the study medication and who had a nasogastric or gastrostomy 
tube in situ received the study medication by bolus via the tube. 
Based on safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data from Part 1 of the study (up to the CCOD of 5 January 
2018, plus data that became available prior to the database snapshot on 6 February 2018), the 
following starting dose levels were selected for Part 2 (dose levels were to be modified and adapted 
upon review of individual patient’s PK data): 
- Infants >1 month old and <3 months old at enrolment: 0.04 mg/kg 
- Infants ≥3 months old and <5 months old at enrollment: 0.08 mg/kg 
- Infants ≥5 months old at enrollment: 0.2 mg/kg 
Limited data from only 4 infants aged 3.3-5 months were available at the time of dose selection for 
Part 2 (with higher exposure observed in 3 of these infants), and no data were available in infants < 3 
months of age. Therefore, as for Part 1, a dose-escalation approach was chosen for Part 2, with a 
lower starting dose for the younger age groups and dose adjustment upon review of the individual PK 
data. PK samples were obtained from each infant and, based on the actual observed PK in each infant, 
the dose was increased to 0.2 mg/kg for all Part 2 patients (which occurred in general for most infants 
within 2 months of treatment start). 
Objectives 
The Part 1 and Part 2 were single arm with active treatment only. The results are compared to natural 
history data on SMA type I / infantile onset both published and owned by the MAA. 
The primary objective and many of the secondary and exploratory objectives for Part 2 were also 
applied to Part 1 of the study, to support the analysis of the Part 1 data provided in this Clinical Study 
Report (CSR). 
Statistical hypothesis: The purpose of Part 2 of the study was to estimate the proportion of infants who 
were sitting without support at 12 months of treatment and to test whether this proportion was higher 
than the pre-defined performance criterion of 5%. This 5% threshold was chosen based on the well-

defined natural history of Type 1 SMA, in which infants never achieve sitting without support (Cobben 
et al. 2008; Finkel et al. 2014a, 2017; De Sanctis et al. 2016). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  Sitting without support for at least 5 seconds, as measured by item 22 of 
the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition (BSID-III) Gross Motor 
Scale.  
The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition (BSID-III) is a measure 
of infant and toddler development that has been standardised on an American paediatric population. A 
supplemental study has also demonstrated strong measurement properties for the BSID-III in 221 
infants in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The BSID consists of a core battery of five scales. Three 
scales (cognitive, motor, language) are administered with child interaction and two scales (social-
emotional, adaptive behaviour) are conducted with parent questionnaires. The BSID-III also includes a 
Behavior Observation Inventory, a separate scale for validating examiner and parent perceptions of the 
child’s responses. For the FIREFISH study only the Gross Motor scale of the BSID-III was used as an 
outcome measure to assess attainment of motor milestones. The other BSID-III scales were not used. 
As per the scoring manual, Item 22 of the BSID-III was not considered to have been achieved if the 
infant sat alone for less than 5 seconds before losing balance and falling over, or if the infant used his 
or her arms to prop him- or herself up. To ensure minimal bias in the assessment of sitting without 
support, the evaluation of sitting was recorded via video in a standardised manner and centrally 
reviewed and scored by two independent readers in addition to the trained site clinical evaluator. The 
assessment of the central independent readers was used for the primary analysis; only if both readers 
classified the infant as having sat for 5 seconds or more was the patient classified as a responder for 
this endpoint. Infants were classified as non-responders (i.e., non-sitters) for the primary analysis if 
they did not achieve sitting, did not maintain sitting achieved earlier, were withdrawn, died, or had a 
missing assessment at Month 12. 
The pre-defined performance criterion for the primary endpoint was 5%.

a  The BSID-III gross motor scale was administered in a modified order, starting with the 
assessment of sitting positions (including the primary endpoint in Part 2). 
b  An infant was classified as a motor milestone responder if more HINE-2 motor milestones 
showed improvement than showed worsening, as defined in the SAP. Improvement was 
defined as at least a 2-point increase in the ability to kick (or maximal score) or a 1-point 
increase in head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking. Worsening was defined 
as at least a 2-point decrease in the ability to kick (or lowest score) or a 1-point decrease in the 
other milestones. Voluntary grasp was excluded from the definition. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Motor Function  
CHOP-INTEND: The CHOP-INTEND (The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for 
Neuromuscular Disorders) score is a sensitive score for motor function ability designed and validated 
specifically for severely affected SMA patients. The patients are scored on 16 items (including joint 
flexion and extension, spontaneous movement and head control), ranging from 0-4 per item. This 
gives a total maximum score of 64. The CHOP-INTEND score represents measures of disease severity. 
Development Motor Milestones 
The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE-2) evaluates the neuromuscular 
development of infants in 8 motor milestone categories (head control, sitting, grasping, ability to kick 
in supine position, rolling, crawling, standing and walking) with 3 to 5 progressively more difficult 
items for each milestone category (with 0 meaning inability to perform a task and 3 or 4 -depending 
on the task- meaning full milestone development).  
The applicant defines a responder as at least a 2-point increase in ability to kick (or maximal score) or 
a 1-point increase in head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking. Worsening is similarly 
defined as a 2-point decrease in ability to kick (or lowest score) or a 1-point decrease in head control, 
rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking. Voluntary grasp is excluded from the definition. An

infant was classified as a responder if more motor milestones showed improvement than showed 
worsening; infants who died or withdrew were classified as non-responders. Infants with a totally 
missing HINE-2 assessment at Month 12 or Month 24 were also classified as non-responders. 
Infants were classified as non-responders if they did not meet the endpoint or if the assessment was 
missing for any reason. For the calculation of the CHOP-INTEND score, BSID-III total raw score and 
HINE-2 total score, if any individual item score contributing to the total score was missing or if ‘Cannot 
test (CNT)’ was recorded, then the item score was set to 0 (if there was at least one non-missing item 
at the assessment). If all items were missing, then the total score was set to missing. 
Other development motor milestones secondary endpoints (in addition to the ones listed in 
Table 3): 
- Proportion of infants who are alive and sitting without support for 5 seconds at Month 24 (defined as 
per the primary endpoint). 
- Proportion of infants who are alive and sitting without support for 30 seconds at Month 24 (defined 
as ’Sits without support for 30 seconds’ as assessed in Item 26 of the BSID-III gross motor scale). 
- Proportion of infants who are alive and standing at Month 24 (defined as ‘Stands alone’ as assessed 
in Item 40 of the BSID-III gross motor scale). 
- Proportion of infants who are alive and walking at Month 24 (defined as ‘Walks alone’ as assessed in 
Item 42 of the BSID-III gross motor scale). 
Other  Survival  and  Ventilation-Free  Survival  secondary  endpoints  (in  addition  to  the  ones 
listed in Table 3) 
- Time to death or permanent ventilation (from enrolment). Permanent ventilation is defined as ≥ 16 
hours of non-invasive ventilation per day or intubation for >21 consecutive days in the absence of, or 
following the resolution of, an acute reversible event or tracheostomy. 
- Proportion of infants alive without permanent ventilation at Month 24 
- Time to death (from enrolment). 
- Proportion of infants alive at Month 24. 
Respiratory secondary endpoints 
- Time to permanent ventilation (from enrolment). 
- Proportion of infants who are without permanent ventilation at Month 12 and Month 24. 
Permanent Ventilation Adjudication Committee 
Time  to  permanent  ventilation  was  determined  by  a  central,  independent  Permanent  Ventilation 
Adjudication Committee. This committee reviews all pertinent data for patients who may have met the 
definition  of  permanent  ventilation  (≥16  hours  of  non-invasive  ventilation  such  as  BiPAP  per  day  or 
intubation for >21 consecutive days in the absence of, or following the resolution of, an acute reversible 
event or tracheostomy) and confirms if the endpoint has been met.

clinician reported Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at Month 12. 
- Proportion of infants with no change or improvement in the ability to swallow as assessed by the 
clinician reported CGI-C at Month 12. 
Sample size 
The target sample size for Part 2 was 40 infants. This sample size provided at least 90% power to test 
the null hypothesis Ho: p ≤ 5% versus the alternative hypothesis Ha: p > 5%, if the true proportion of 
infants who would sit on treatment was 20%, based on an exact binomial test with a one-sided 5% 
significance level. With a planned sample size of 40 infants, a minimum of 5 infants sitting without 
support would provide a statistically significant difference from the pre-defined performance criterion 
(i.e., the lower limit of the two-sided 90% Clopper-Pearson [exact] confidence interval would be above 
5%). In the sample size calculations, no allowance was made for infants who withdraw early, as these 
infants would be classified as non-responders/non-sitters and included within the primary analysis.

•Statistical methods 
For Part 1 and Part 2 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH), the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population (defined as all 
patients enrolled, regardless of whether they received treatment or not) of each part is the primary 
analysis population for all efficacy analyses (with the exception of weight-for-age and length/height-
for-age percentiles, which were analysed based on the safety population). 
Efficacy results from Part 2 are compared to, and put into context with, data describing the natural 
history of untreated infants with Type 1 SMA. These natural history data were used to define 
thresholds of achievement, i.e. objective performance criteria or performance goals, against which to 
assess the efficacy of treatment.  
Part 2 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) is designed to test whether the proportion of patients sitting 
without support after 12 months of treatment (as assessed by Item 22 of the BSID-III gross motor 
scale) is higher than a performance criterion set at 5% (i.e., a threshold of achievement for risdiplam-
treated patients to be assessed against within this study). This 5% threshold was chosen to allow 
sufficient confidence that any effect seen in treated patients is greater than what could be expected 
from the natural history of the disease; as per definition, Type 1 SMA patients never sit unsupported 
(Cobben et al. 2008; Finkel et al. 2014). A statistically significant result would be achieved when a 
minimum of 6 out of 41 infants are sitting without support for 5 seconds after 12 months of treatment 
with risdiplam, based on an exact binomial test with a one-sided 5% significance level. If, in Part 2 of 
the study, 6 out of 41 patients (14.6% [90% CI: 6.6%−26.9%]) are sitting without support at Month 
12, the lower limit of the two-sided 90% Clopper-Pearson (exact) confidence interval (CI) would be 
above 5%. 
The performance criteria for the milestones of sitting without support, standing alone and walking 
alone have been pre-defined in the study protocol (set at 5%) and will not be based on benchmarks 
derived from the historical data sources. 
For the analysis of the primary endpoint ‘proportion of patients who are sitting without support at 12 
months of treatment’, patients who did not achieve the milestone of sitting, who did not maintain a 
sitting status achieved earlier, who were withdrawn, or who died were classified as non-responders 
(i.e., non-sitters) at the time of assessment. The assessment of the independent central readers was 
used for the primary analysis. 
Performance criteria were also derived for some of the secondary efficacy endpoints in Part 2. These 
criteria were derived using data from similar cohorts of untreated infants with Type 1 SMA constructed 
from real world data sources/natural history studies. If multiple sources of data were available for a 
secondary endpoint, the cohort with the baseline characteristics most similar to those targeted by the 
study inclusion and exclusion criteria was used. The benchmark was based on the associated upper 
limit of the 90% CI from the historical data. When a pre-defined benchmark could be determined for 
the secondary endpoint, hypothesis testing was performed (see Table 8). 
To control for multiplicity across the different endpoints, a hierarchical testing approach was 
implemented. The first secondary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of infants who achieve a score of 40 
or higher in the CHOP-INTEND at Month 12, was tested if and only if the primary endpoint had reached 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 121/293 
 
 
the 5% significance level (i.e., p-value ≤0.05). Other secondary endpoints were tested at a 5% 
significance level according to the following hierarchy, as long as the p-value was ≤0.05 for endpoints 
higher in the hierarchy: 
•  Proportion of patients achieving a score of 40 or higher in their CHOP-INTEND scores at Month 
12 
•  Proportion of patients achieving an increase of at least 4 points in their CHOP-INTEND scores 
from baseline at Month 12 
•  Proportion of motor milestone responders as assessed by HINE-2 at Month 12 
•  Proportion of patients who were alive without permanent ventilation at Month 12 
•  Proportion of patients sitting without support for 30 seconds at Month 24 (as assessed in item 
26 of the BSID-III gross motor scale) 
•  Proportion of patients standing at Month 24 (as assessed in item 40 of the BSID-III gross 
motor scale) 
•  Proportion of patients walking at Month 24 (as assessed in item 42 of the BSID-III gross motor 
scale) 
The Month 24 endpoints will be analysed when all infants have reached 24 months of treatment. Any 
other endpoints for which hypothesis testing was performed were simultaneously tested at the 5% 
significance level without adjustment for multiplicity, as they were considered to provide supportive 
information. 
Proportions and 90% CIs are presented for the key efficacy outcomes at Month 12: 
●  Patients sitting without support for 5 seconds 
●  Patients achieving a score of 40 or higher in their CHOP-INTEND scores 
●  Patients achieving an increase of at least 4 points in their CHOP-INTEND scores from baseline 
●  Motor milestone responders as assessed by HINE-2 
●  Patients who were alive without permanent ventilation 
●  Patients who were alive 
●  Patients with the ability to feed orally 
●  Patients with the ability to swallow 
●  Patients with no hospitalisations 
Through Scientific Advice, CHMP previously agreed that matching on an individual basis may be 
difficult in this limited and heterogeneous patient population. Therefore, CHMP at the time of SA 
agreed that the approach for generating performance criteria with a 90% upper and lower limit of the 
confidence interval may the next best option, but the applicant was encouraged to continue developing 
the best possible understanding and description of the disease course relevant to the population that 
are included in the trial.

Clinical Study of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (PNCR Network) 
The PNCR Network are conducting a multi-centre, observational cohort study designed to allow for a 
comprehensive baseline characterisation of the SMA patient population and collect longitudinal follow-
up data on this population (Protocol version 6, March 2007). The study includes Type 1, 2 and 3 
patients with a clinical diagnosis of SMA, a genetic diagnosis of SMN1 gene deletion, and a diagnosis of 
SMA before 19 years of age. The PNCR Network was established to evaluate SMA patients at three 
sites in the United States. Patients from a fourth site in the United States have subsequently been 
included in the database. 
A prospective cohort study to characterize the clinical features of Type 1 SMA has been published by 
the PNCR Network (Finkel et al., 2014b), and data from the PNCR Network was included in a 
retrospective study to assess developmental milestones in infants with Type 1 SMA (De Sanctis et al., 
2016). 
The applicant has access to patient-level data from the PNCR Network through the SMA Foundation.  
NeuroNEXT SMA infant biomarker study 
The population in the NeuroNEXT SMA infant biomarker study (Kolb et al., 2016; Kolb et al., 2017) 
was judged to be most similar to the expected population in Study BP39056. Whenever possible, the 
performance criterion derived from this study was selected as the benchmark to be used for hypothesis 
testing. When data for an endpoint was not available from the NeuroNEXT SMA infant biomarker study, 
the benchmark was derived from the study conducted by De Sanctis et al. (2016). The upper limit of 
the 90% CI was used to define the performance criterion for each endpoint following Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) scientific advice. The 90% CI is expected to be conservative 
when the sample size of the selected study is smaller. The NeuroNEXT SMA infant biomarker 
study includes 16 infants with 2 copies of the SMN2 gene, and the study conducted by De 
Sanctis et al. (2016) includes 24 infants classified as Type 1B. 
Table 25 shows the performance criteria that will be used for hypothesis testing in Study BP39056.

Table 24 - Performance Criteria to Use for Hypothesis Testing in Study BP39056 
Due to the lack of patient-level data available for the majority of observational studies, benchmarks 
derived from these studies were set at approximately 18 months of age for the Month 12 endpoints, 
and approximately 30 months of age for the Month 24 endpoints. These ages were chosen to reflect 
the expected average age of the infants that will be enrolled in Part 2 of Study BP39056 after 12 (and 
24) months of treatment. When individual patient-level data was available (e.g., data from the PNCR 
Network), patients who had their first visit before 7 (+1) months of age were included in the analyses 
(not including time-to-event analyses) in order to reflect the expected age of enrollment in Study 
BP39056. In these cases, benchmarks were set at approximately 12 and 24 months of follow-up. 
Kaplan-Meier curves for time-to-death or permanent ventilation, time-to-death and time to permanent 
ventilation were estimated from published material, or from individual patient-level data, where 
available. Patients with no event reported prior to the analysis cutoff date were censored at the latest 
date before the cutoff in which they were known to be event-free (i.e., the latest date before the cutoff 
in which they were known to be: (1) alive and without permanent ventilation for time-to-death or 
permanent ventilation, (2) alive for time-to-death, and (3) without permanent ventilation for time to 
permanent ventilation). For time to permanent ventilation, patients who died but did not require 
permanent ventilation were censored at the death date. 
Survival probabilities (proportion of patients who were event-free at a given time-point) were 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, and 60%, 80% and 90% CIs were estimated using the 
complimentary log-log transformation for the estimated survivor function S(t). Standard errors were 
computed via Greenwood’s formula. Two-sided 60%, 80% and 90% Clopper-Pearson (exact) CIs were 
calculated for proportions of responders. For responder/non-responder definitions, patients who did not

maintain an earlier response or had a missing assessment at the time-point of interest (for any reason) 
were classified as non-responders. 
LIMITATIONS  
Despite attempts to derive the performance criteria from cohorts of patients who are similar to the 
population in Study BP39056, there are a number of limitations to this approach: 
- There are a limited number of studies available to describe some of the endpoints in Study BP39056, 
and the number of patients available for some of the endpoints is small. 
- The use of the upper limit of the CI instead of the point estimate to define the performance criteria 
may be overly conservative, especially at the 90% level, given that the width of the CI is governed by 
the sample size. 
- The majority of the sources used to derive a performance criterion for one of the endpoints in Study 
BP39056 were based on data from a limited number of countries and sites, with studies primarily 
conducted in the United States. Some of the endpoints included in Study BP39056 are determined by 
treatment decisions and standard of care in treating centres, as well as cultural norms, and so may 
vary across countries and sites. Examples include the extent of supportive medical care, the decision 
to permanently ventilate an infant, and the decision to intervene for nutritional support. Study 
BP39056 is a global, multi-centre study potentially including sites in Europe, North America, South 
America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East, and differences in the standard of care across countries and 
sites may lead to substantial variability in patient outcomes. This will make comparisons between study 
results and observational studies more challenging. 
- Benchmarks derived from observational data sources at 18 (and 30) months of age may not reflect 
the average age of the infants enrolled in Study BP39056 after 12 (and 24) months of treatment. 
- The endpoint definitions or assessments used to measure a certain concept in the different studies 
may not match the definitions or assessments used in Study BP39056. Specifically, 
- The definition of permanent ventilation varies across the different sources and does not match the 
definition used in Study BP39056 (defined as ≥ 16 hours of non-invasive ventilation per day or 
intubation for > 21 consecutive days in the absence of, or following the resolution of, an acute 
reversible event; or tracheostomy). This includes differences in the number of hours of ventilation per 
day, the number of consecutive days with this level of respiratory support, and the type of respiratory 
support provided. 
- The HINE-2 was used to assess motor milestones in the study conducted by De Sanctis et al. (2016), 
while Study BP39056 will use the modified BSID-III gross motor scale, and item 12 of the CHOP-
INTEND for head control. 
Since some endpoints may be affected by differences in standard of care between centres, Roche plans 
to conduct a global, multi-centre, retrospective, chart review study of infants with Type 1 SMA who 
have similar clinical characteristics to the infants included in Study BP39056, and who received care at 
the same sites (Roche no. BP39859). This will generate additional data on the natural history of Type 1 
SMA in a similar cohort to Study BP39056. As the data extraction will occur at the time of site set-up 
and patient inclusion in Study BP39056, the results of this study will not inform the pre-defined 
thresholds used to assess the efficacy of treatment, but once available, data from this study will 
provide additional context for the results of Study BP39056. The results of this study will contribute to 
sensitivity analyses of Study BP39056.

Sensitivity Analyses 
As a sensitivity analysis, the analysis described for the primary efficacy endpoint (the proportion of 
infants sitting without support for 5 seconds at Month 12) was performed using the assessment of the 
site clinical evaluator instead of the assessment of the two independent central readers. Sensitivity 
analyses were also performed using an alternative definition of sitting without support, with sitting 
defined by the HINE-2 categories of ‘Stable sit’ or ‘Pivots (rotates).’ 
Results 
Participant flow 
PART 2 
A total of 52 patients were screened for enrolment in Part 2 of the study, of whom 11 patients were 
screen failures. Reasons for screen failure are provided; the most common reasons were death (4 
patients) and failure to meet inclusion criteria (3 patients). 
A total of 41 patients with Type 1 SMA were enrolled into Part 2 of pivotal Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
across 14 different sites in 10 countries (Brazil, China, Croatia, France, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, 
Turkey, and the United States). At the time of the CCOD, 38 of 41 patients (92.7%) in Part 2 were still 
ongoing in the study; these 38 patients were older than 14 months of age. Three patients (7.3%) died 
due to SMA-related respiratory complications within the first three months following enrolment. All 
patients received treatment with risdiplam. 
Of the 41 patients enrolled in Part 2, 22 (53.7%) were female and 19 (46.3%) were male. At 
enrolment, the median age of all patients was 5.3 months (range: 2.2 6.9 months); 22 of 41 patients 
(53.7%) were older than 5 months. The median age at diagnosis was 2.8 months (range: 0.9 6.1 
months) and the age at onset of symptoms ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 months. Patients’ weight-for-age 
values were at or below the 50th percentile at baseline, based on World Health Organization (WHO) 
Child Growth Standards, for the majority of patients (29/41, 70.7%) with a median weight-for-age 
percentile of 24.0 (range: 0.2–99.0th percentile). Patients’ length/height-for-age values were above 
the 50th percentile at baseline for the majority of patients (26/41, 63.4%), with a median 
length/height-for-age percentile of 66.2 (range: 0.3–100th percentile). 
In accordance with the inclusion criteria, all patients had a genetic diagnosis of SMA (SMN1) and had 
two SMN2 gene copies. 
At baseline, the median BSID-III Gross Motor Scale score was 2.0 (range: 0.0–8.0), the median CHOP-
INTEND score was 22.0 points (range: 8.0–37.0), the median HINE-2 score was 1.0 point (range 0.0–
5.0), and the median baseline CMAP amplitude was 0.2 mV (range: 0.0–0.8), confirming all enrolled 
patients had well-established symptomatic SMA disease at baseline. 
At the CCOD of 14 November 2019, patients enrolled in Part 2 had been treated for a median of 15.2 
months (range: 1.6-20.1 months).

Baseline data 
PART 2 
Of the 41 patients enrolled in Part 2, 22 were female (53.7%). The majority of patients were White 
(22/41, 53.7%) or Asian (14/41, 34.1%); race was reported as unknown for 5 patients (12.2%). Five 
patients (12.2%) were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 
Patients in Part 2 had a median age of 5.3 months (range: 2.2-6.9 months) at enrolment. The majority 
of patients were enrolled at sites in Europe (24/41, 58.5%); 1 patient (2.4%) was enrolled in the 
United States, and 16 patients (39.0%) were enrolled at sites in the rest of the world. The countries 
with the highest enrolment were China (11/41, 26.8%) and Italy (10/41, 24.4%). Of the 41 patients in

Part 2, 16 were international patients who were relocated with their families from their country of 
residence to one that had a study site. 
Patients’ weight-for-age values were at or below the 50th percentile at baseline, based on WHO Child 
Growth Standards, for the majority of patients (29/41, 70.7%). For 15 patients (36.6%), the baseline 
weight-for-age values were at or below the 10th percentile. The median weight-for-age percentile was 
the 24.0th (range: 0.2-99.0th percentile).

Table 25: Summary of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (ITT Population, Part 2 
Patients) 
According to the WHO Child Growth Standards, 6 patients were below the 3rd percentile at baseline. 
However, all of these patients met the inclusion criteria (body weight >=3rd percentile for age, using 
appropriate country-specific guidelines) at the screening visit based on local growth charts and 
investigator assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021

Patients’ length/height-for-age values were above the 50th percentile at baseline for the majority of 
patients (26/41, 63.4%), with a median length/height-for-age percentile of 66.2nd (range: 0.3-100th 
percentile). 
At baseline, 51.2% of patients (21/41) were at or below the 50th percentile for head circumference for 
age values, and 48.8% (20/41) of patients were above the 50th percentile. The median head 
circumference-for-age percentile was the 47.3rd (range: 0.6-99.8th percentile). 
At baseline, the median head circumference was 41.5 cm (range: 38.3-46.0 cm), the median chest 
circumference was 38.5 cm (range: 32.0-46.6 cm), and the median ratio of chest to head 
circumference was 0.93 (range: 0.7-1.1). 
The baseline characteristics of patients in Part 2 were typical of a symptomatic Type 1 SMA population, 
with a median age of 1.5 months (range: 1.0-3.0 months) at symptom onset. The disease duration 
(time between onset of symptoms and first treatment) was >3 months in 27 patients (65.9%) and ≤3 
months in 14 patients (34.1%), for a median disease duration of 3.4 months (range: 1.0-6.0 months). 
All patients had an SMN2 copy number of 2, as required by the study inclusion criteria. Median baseline 
scores for CHOP-INTEND (22.0), BSID-III (2.0), HINE-2 (1.0), and CMAP amplitude (0.2 mV) were 
low, as expected for this symptomatic patient population. Patients’ current levels of motor function at 
screening were also typical of this patient population, confirming that all patients had well-established 
disease by the time of study enrolment. The majority of patients (29/41, 70.7%) were receiving no 
pulmonary care at baseline; 10 patients (24.4%) were receiving non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) 
support for <16 hours/day, and 4 patients were receiving cough assistance (3 patients [7.3%] 
received it daily as a prophylactic therapy [not acute-illness related] and 1 patient [2.4%] received it 
because of an ongoing illness. All but 1 patient were able to swallow at baseline. The majority of 
patients (33/41, 80.5%) were fed exclusively by mouth, 2 patients (4.9%) were fed via a combination 
of oral and tube feeding, and 4 patients (9.8%) were fed via a feeding tube at baseline; information 
about feeding route at baseline was missing for 2 patients (4.9%). 
Concurrent medical conditions (i.e., those ongoing at screening) were reported in 11 patients (26.8%), 
the most frequent condition, by PT, being haemangioma (2/41, 4.9%). 
Six patients (14.6%) in Part 2 underwent SMA-related surgeries or procedures prior to treatment with 
risdiplam; all 6 patients had a gastrointestinal tube inserted. 
Nineteen patients (46.3%) underwent SMA-related surgeries or procedures after the date of first 
risdiplam dose; those performed in more than 1 patient, by MedDRA PT, were gastrostomy (6 patients 
[14.6%]); gastrointestinal tube insertion and gastrointestinal tube removal (each performed in 5 
patients [12.2%]); endotracheal intubation, extubation, and mechanical ventilation (each performed in 
4 patients [9.8%]); and bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheostomy (each performed in 2 patients 
[4.9%]). 
Twenty-eight patients (68.3%) in Part 2 had at least one prior medication that was taken and 
completed prior to starting risdiplam treatment. 
Twenty-seven patients (65.9%) received prior and ongoing medications (i.e., that were started prior to 
onset of risdiplam treatment and that were ongoing at the date of first dose). The most common 
medications, by medication class, were antispasmodics and anticholinergics (17 patients, 41.5%), 
vitamins and minerals (11 patients, 26.8%), and adrenergics/sympathomimetics (10 patients, 24.4%).  
Twenty-two patients (53.7%) received concomitant medications for prophylaxis (defined as those 
within the medication classes of Vitamins and Minerals or Vaccines, Toxoids, and Serologic Agents). 
Assessment report

Page 131/293 
 
 
Twenty-one patients (51.2%) received other concomitant medications (i.e., medications not taken for 
AEs or prophylaxis) on or after the date of the first dose of risdiplam. The most common of these other 
medications, by medication class, were antispasmodics and anticholinergics (15 patients, 36.6%).

All enrolled patients were included in the analysis. 
Outcomes and estimation 
PART 2  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was met. After 12 months of treatment with risdiplam, 
29.3% of patients in Part 2 were sitting without support, as assessed by Item 22 of the BSID-III gross 
motor scale. This proportion is significantly higher than the pre-defined performance criterion of 5% 
based on natural history data (p<0.0001). 
The results of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints supported the primary endpoint, 
showing that risdiplam treatment was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in patients 
with Type 1 SMA at Month 12: 
●  56.1% of patients achieved a CHOP-INTEND total score of 40 or higher, and 90.2% of patients 
achieved an increase of at least 4 points in their CHOP-INTEND score from baseline. These 
results are significantly higher than the pre-defined performance criteria of 17% based on 
natural history data (p<0.0001 for each of these endpoints). 
●  Motor milestone development was further confirmed by the HINE-2, as a second independent 
assessment; 78.0% of patients were classified as motor milestone responders (defined as 
having more milestones that showed improvement from baseline than showed worsening) as 
assessed by the HINE-2. This proportion was significantly higher than the pre-defined 
performance criterion of 12% based on natural history data (p<0.0001). 
●  85.4% of patients were alive without permanent ventilation. This proportion is significantly 
higher than the pre-defined performance criterion of 42% based on natural history data 
(p<0.0001). 
●  92.7% of patients were alive. This proportion is significantly higher than the pre-defined 
performance criterion of 60% based on natural history data (p=0.0005). 
●  82.9% of patients had the ability to feed orally. 
●  9 patients (22.0%) could either stand with support (2 patients) or support weight (7 patients) 
when assessing the standing item, and 1 patient (2.4%) could bounce when assessing the 
walking item according to the HINE-2.

Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Endpoint:  The results of the primary analysis are supported by 
the results of sensitivity analyses performed using a different scale with an alternative definition of 
sitting without support. At 12 months of treatment, 10 of 41 patients (24.4%; 90% CI: 13.9%, 
37.9%) in Part 2 were sitting without support, as assessed by the HINE-2 categories of ‘Stable sit’ and 
‘Pivots (rotates).’  
Survival and Ventilation-Free Survival 
Three patients died within the first three months following study enrolment and 3 patients met the 
endpoint of permanent ventilation. The median time to death or permanent ventilation was not 
estimable as too few patients had an event. Meeting the permanent ventilation endpoint did not 
represent an end-stage disease as all 3 patients showed improved CHOP-INTEND scores at Month 12 
of treatment. The reasons for meeting the permanent ventilation endpoint were: prolonged intubation 
for the treatment of a serious adverse event (SAE; this patient was later extubated and was breathing 
without support of intubation or prolonged use of BiPAP at Month 12), tracheostomy due to difficulties 
in performing oral intubation to treat an SAE, and tracheostomy due to vocal cord palsy in the context 
of recurrent respiratory SAEs and repeated intubation/extubation.

Methods 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) is being conducted in two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Patients in Part 1 did not 
enrol into Part 2 of the study, therefore, Parts 1 and 2 are considered as two independent studies. 
Part 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised (2:1, risdiplam: placebo), dose-finding 
study in patients with Type 2 and Type 3 (ambulant or non-ambulant) SMA (Figure 5). The primary 
objective of Part 1 was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of risdiplam and to select the 
dose for Part 2, the confirmatory part of the study. The efficacy endpoints for Part 1 are identical to the 
main key efficacy endpoints used in Part 2, and were assessed in the same manner for both Part 1 and 
2. All assessments and data collection was conducted by trained physicians and/or physical therapists. 
Patients in Part 1 were enrolled in a dose escalating design. Upon completion of the minimum 12-week 
placebo-controlled treatment period, patients who were assigned to placebo were switched to active 
treatment at the dose tested in their respective cohort.  
The pivotal dose decision for Part 2 was based on safety and PK/PD data from Part 1 of the study and 
was endorsed by the iDMC in August 2017. After selection of the pivotal dose for Part 2, all patients 
from Part 1 received the pivotal dose as part of the open-label treatment phase (Figure 5). The open-
label treatment phase of Part 1 remains ongoing, and data from this period continues to be assessed to 
demonstrate the long-term efficacy of risdiplam. 
Part 2, the confirmatory part, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised (2:1, 
risdiplam:placebo) study, investigating the efficacy and safety of risdiplam at the selected pivotal dose 
from Part 1 over a 24 month treatment period, in patients with Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 SMA 
aged 2 to 25 years (Figure 5). The primary analysis of Part 2 was conducted at the end of the 12-
month placebo-controlled period, after which patients initially randomised to placebo were switched to 
active treatment in a blinded manner. Part 2 remains ongoing, with all patients receiving risdiplam. In 
Part 2, the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of risdiplam.

The two parts of the study are independent, have their own objectives and eligibility criteria, and are 
being analysed separately. Patients in Part 1 did not roll over into Part 2 of the study. 
In certain countries (based on pre-established Health Authority and Ethics Committee approval), the 
study progressed in an operationally seamless manner from Part 1 into Part 2 after the dose-selection 
decision was taken by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC). 
All patients enrolled in this study who initially received placebo were switched to active treatment, as 
described below for Parts 1 and 2, respectively. 
Part 2 
Part 2 of Study BP39055 was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of risdiplam over a 24-
month treatment period, in patients aged 2-25 years with Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 SMA. 
A total of 168 patients were planned to be randomised (2:1) to receive either risdiplam (at the pivotal 
dose of 5 mg once daily for patients with a body weight [BW] >=20 kg or 0.25 mg/kg for patients with 
a BW < 20 kg) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by age group (2-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-17 
years, and 18-25 years at randomisation). No more than 30 patients were to be randomised into the 
18-25 years age group. A minimum of 45 patients were to be randomised into each of the other three 
age groups. Patients from Part 1 were not included in Part 2. 
The duration of the study for each patient enrolled in Part 2 is up to 25 months.

Objectives 
The primary objectives of Part 2 was: To evaluate the efficacy of risdiplam compared with placebo in 
terms of motor function in patients with Type 2 SMA and non-ambulant Type 3 SMA, as assessed by 
the change from baseline in the total score of the Motor Function Measure (MFM) at 12 months. 
The controlled part of the study was a superiority over placebo study for the primary endpoint. 
The hypothesis tested was that the difference in the mean change from baseline in the total MFM32 
score at Month 12 between risdiplam and placebo was 0. If the two-sided p-value was <=5%, then the 
null hypothesis, of no difference in the mean change from baseline in the total MFM32 score at Month 
12 between risdiplam and placebo, was rejected. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Part 2 
Primary Efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from (original) baseline in the total motor function 
measure 32 (MFM32) score at Month 12. The MFM32 total score was calculated according to the user 
manual. The 32 scores were summed and then transformed onto a 0-100 scale (i.e., sum of 32 items 
scores divided by 96 and multiplied by 100) to yield the MFM32 total score expressed as a percentage 
of the maximum score possible for the scale (the one obtained with no physical impairment).

Table 27: Motor Function Outcome Measure Overview for Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
Outcome Measure 
Clinical Meaningfulness 
Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM32) 
MFM32 is a valid and reliable assessment of 
motor function ability in neuromuscular 
diseases, including SMA, validated in 
individuals aged 6 years and older 
(Bérard et al. 2005). A recent validation 
study has also demonstrated strong 
evidence of reliability (including excellent 
internal consistency and test-retest 
reliability results) and validity (including 
strong convergent validity and known-
groups validity results) in individuals with 
neuromuscular diseases, including SMA, 
aged 2−5 years old (Trundell et al. 2019). 
Although a shorter version of the MFM (the 
20-item MFM [MFM20]) has been used in 
children younger than 7 years (de Lattre et 
al. 2013), the 12 excluded items assess 
functions important for daily life. In clinical 
trials such as Study BP39055 (SUNFISH), 
the purpose of a functional scale is to 
assess changes following treatment 
intervention rather than to characterise 
cross-sectional scores. Thus, there is a 
practical and conceptual basis for inclusion 
of the 12 items in younger patients in 
clinical trials assessing treatment 
intervention, including 2−6-year olds. 
The MFM32 contains 32 items, all of which 
patients have confirmed are related to 
everyday activities of daily living (Duong et 
al. 2020a [draft]). The MFM32 is assessed 
in three domains of motor function: D1 
(standing and transfers), D2 (axial and 
proximal motor function), and D3 (distal 
motor function). The 32 items scored on a 
0−3 scale are summed and then 
transformed onto a 0−100 scale (i.e., sum 
MFM32 is a clinically relevant scale as it 
evaluates different levels of motor function in 
individuals with SMA, from distal fine motor 
movements of the hands to more complex 
gross motor function activities such as 
standing and transfers. The MFM32, 
therefore, has the ability to assess a 
spectrum of motor function across a broad 
range of patients at different stages of SMA 
disease progression: from ambulant to non-
ambulant patients with a progressed disease. 
This is particularly meaningful in the context 
of the heterogeneous Type 2 and 3 SMA 
patient population included in Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH).  
Natural history data collected on patients 
aged 5.7 to 59 years, including Type 1, 2, 
and 3 SMA patients, demonstrated that the 
overall slope of decline over time using the 
MFM32 total score is in the range of −0.9 
points/year for Type 2 patients and −0.6 
points/year for Type 3 patients (Vuillerot et 
al. 2013).  
SMA patients describe stabilisation in their 
functional ability as a meaningful outcome 
(McGraw et al. 2017; Cure SMA 2015; 
Rouault et al. 2017). These results were 
confirmed by a recent survey conducted by 
SMA Europe covering 18 European countries 
and including over 1300 responses from 
patients and caregivers aged from 0 to 81 
years across all SMA types. The survey 
confirmed that almost all participants 
(96.7%) considered stabilisation as progress

of 32 items scores divided by 96 and 
multiplied by 100) to yield the MFM32 total 
score expressed as a percentage of the 
maximum score possible for the scale (the 
one obtained with no physical impairment). 
The lower the total score, the more severe 
the functional impairment. 
Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) 
The RULM assesses upper limb motor 
performance in SMA patients. It is a 
validated scale in SMA, which has 
demonstrated good reliability and validity 
(Mazzone et al. 2017). 
The RULM has typically been used in 
conjunction with the HFMSE (which does 
not assess fine motor hand, wrist, or elbow 
function) to understand changes in upper 
limb ability and capture change in weaker 
SMA patients. The RULM is particularly 
important for non-ambulant patients who 
rely on preservation of upper limb ability to 
complete daily activities.  
The RULM consists of 19 items (scored on a 
0−2 scale for 18 items and 0−1 for one 
item) assessing the performance of 
shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand function. 
A total score from 0−37 is calculated with 
higher scores indicating greater upper limb 
functioning. 
(Gusset 2020), even in the current clinical 
environment where some patients have 
access to a disease modifying treatment. 
In the context of the MFM32, a recent 
interview (n=40) and survey study (n=217) 
has demonstrated that for Type 2 and Type 3 
patients and caregivers, maintaining current 
level of functional ability on the MFM32 over 
a 1 year period would be a meaningful 
outcome for 98% (interview data) and 90% 
(survey data) of the samples surveyed, 
respectively (Duong et al. 2020b [draft]). 
Moreover, 100% (interview data) and 98% 
(survey data) of subjects confirmed that 
gaining some level of improvement was 
meaningful.  
A threshold of improvement on the MFM32 
scale, such as ≥3 points, should be 
considered as a marked improvement for 
patients because it may represent either the 
acquisition of a new function or the 
improvement in performance of several 
functions. 
The preservation of upper limb function in 
SMA is particularly important as it ensures 
independence for essential everyday 
activities such as eating, washing, and 
dressing. In addition, the RULM includes 
items relating to upper limb strength (e.g., 
lifting a weighted object) which are not 
captured by the HFMSE and MFM32. Having 
the strength to lift objects is an important 
aspect of daily living as it may help patients 
to eat on their own, or to live independently 
in their own home. For non-ambulant 
patients with a progressed disease, fine 
motor skills are critical for social connections 
(e.g., use of phone or computer) and for 
operating a wheelchair. For this reason, 
assessing the impact of the disease in the 
upper extremities is of great importance for 
this patient population.  
Natural history data show that over 12 
months, the mean change in RULM score is 
−0.4 points in Type 2 and Type 3 patients 
aged 2.7 to 49.7 years (Pera et al. 2019).  
Patients and caregivers have reported that 
small improvements and stabilisation on the 
RULM (in context of the ULM) have 
meaningful impacts on daily life (McGraw et 
al. 2017).

Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) 
The HFMSE was developed to assess gross 
motor function in individuals aged two 
years or older, with Type 2 and 3 SMA 
(O’Hagen et al. 2007). The HFMSE has 
well-established psychometric properties in 
children with SMA (O’Hagen et al. 2007; 
Glanzman et al. 2011). The scale was 
modified and 13 items were added to the 
original version of the measure (HFMS) in 
order to also capture changes in stronger 
patients; those extra items were 
particularly aimed at ambulant individuals 
(Cano et al. 2014).  
The HFMSE contains 33 items designed to 
assess important functional abilities, 
including standing, transfers, ambulation, 
and proximal and axial function. Each item 
is scored on a 0−2 scale by a clinical 
evaluator. A total score from 0−66 is 
calculated with higher scores indicating 
greater functioning. 
The scale has been widely used in SMA type 
2 and 3 (Mercuri et al. 2019) and includes 
clinically relevant items assessing sitting, 
rolling, transitions relating to crawling and 
kneeling, and standing/stepping. There are 
no items that assess the fine motor function 
of the hand, wrist, or elbow, which are 
critical functions for weak, wheelchair bound 
non-ambulant patients. 
Natural history data from Type 2 and Type 3 
patients aged 2−45 years collected using the 
HFMSE shows a change of 0.08 points over 
the course of 12 months, a decline of −0.24 
points after 24 months, and a decline of 
−2.31 points after 36 months, on average 
(Kaufmann et al. 2012). Another study of 
Type 2 and Type 3 patients aged 2.5 to 55 
years, including ambulant and non-ambulant 
individuals, demonstrated that the overall 
slope of decline in the HFSME total score 
over a 12-month period is -0.57 in non-
ambulant patients (Mercuri et al. 2016). The 
change in HFMSE varied across age groups: 
+0.04 in children <5 years, −0.96 in children 
and adolescents aged ≥5 to <15 years, and 
−0.35 in adolescents ≥15 years (Mercuri et 
al. 2016). 
Patients and caregivers have also reported 
that stabilisation and small improvements on 
the HFMSE are meaningful in daily life 
(McGraw et al. 2017). A threshold of 
improvement on the HFMSE scale, such as ε3 
points (Mercuri et al. 2018), should be 
considered as a marked improvement for 
patients, especially in the context of a 
progressive disease.Recent meaningful 
change analyses indicate that a 2-point 
change could be considered a meaningful 
difference (Williams et al. 2019).  
Sample size 
Part 2 
The purpose of this part of the study is to estimate and test the treatment effect of RO7034067 at the 
selected dose from Part 1 relative to placebo. A target sample size of 168 patients will be randomised, 
112 patients on RO7034067 and 56 patients on placebo (2:1 randomisation). For the primary endpoint 
of the mean change from baseline in the total MFM32 score at Month 12, this sample size (allowing for 
a 10% drop-out rate) provides at least 80% power at a two-sided 5% significance level for testing the 
null hypothesis that the true treatment difference is zero versus the alternative hypothesis, given that 
the true treatment difference is 3 and assuming that the common standard deviation will be 6 (twice 
the value seen in Vuillerot et al 2013). This corresponds to a hypothesised effect size of 0.5. The 
minimal detectable treatment difference is approximately 2.03.

In Protocol Version 3 released on 7 March 2017 (thus prior to first patient enrolment) changes were 
made to the Part 2 SUNFISH design, to mitigate expected recruitment and retention challenges 
considering launch of SPINRAZA (nusinersen) in the U.S. and ongoing Expanded Access Programme in 
Europe: the randomisation ratio was changed from 1:1 to 2 (active):1 (placebo), and the sample size 
was increased to maintain the same statistical power. The target sample size was 168 patients with 
112 patients randomised to risdiplam and 56 patients randomised to placebo (2:1 randomisation). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was performed using an Interactive (voice/web) Response System (IxRS). Separate 
randomisation lists were generated for the exploratory dose-finding Part 1 and the confirmatory Part 2 
of the study. In both parts of the study, patients were randomised to risdiplam or placebo in a 2:1 
ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
In Part 2 of the study, patients and investigators are blinded to the initial treatment assignment until 
the last patient in Part 2 completes the 24-month assessments. All individuals in direct contact with the 
patient at the investigative site are blinded until this point, except for the unblinded pharmacist 
handling study drug. For this part of the study, the Sponsor remained blinded to treatment assignment 
information for patients randomised until the last patient randomised into Part 2 completed their 12-
month assessment and the database was locked for the purpose of the primary and secondary efficacy 
analyses. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy Analysis Population: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomised patients 
in Part 2 will be the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses. Patients under the ITT 
population will be reported according to the treatment they were randomised to. Patients who were not 
randomised but received study medication will be excluded from the ITT population. 
The primary efficacy estimand is based on a hypothetical treatment strategy assuming no 
prohibited medications intended for treatment of SMA are available and patients continue on their 
randomised treatment until the primary analysis timepoint. The prohibited medications are defined in 
the protocol. A treatment policy strategy will also be applied if applicable. For any patients who 
discontinue study treatment but continue in the study, all data will be included regardless of 
initialisation on prohibited medications.  
The baseline/original baseline for Part 2 of the study is defined as the last measurement prior to first 
dose of the study medication, either placebo or risdiplam. The adjusted baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the first dose of risdiplam treatment. The adjusted baseline is the same as the 
original baseline for those patients initially randomised to and receive risdiplam treatment. 
Primary analysis: Results from the primary endpoint were summarised descriptively for each 
timepoint by treatment group. 
The Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis will also be performed on the change from 
baseline in the total MFM32 score using all data collected in Part 2 up to 12 months. 
The model can be expressed as the following: 
Yi=Xi β + Zi νi + εi 
where 
- Yi is the ni x 1 vector of responses for patient i of the dependent variable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 145/293 
 
 
- Xi is the known ni x p design matrix of fixed effects. 
- β is a p x 1 vector of the unknown population parameters relate to the fixed effect. 
- Zi is the known ni x r random effect design matrix. 
- vi is the r x 1 vector of the unknown parameters for the subject/patient -effect which is distributed as 
N(0, ∑v)  
- εi is the random error term for patient i which is a ni x 1 vector of random residuals distributed 
independently as N(0, ∑εi) 
- vi and εi  i are independent. 
This is a mixed-effects model which contains components for fixed effects, random effect and the 
random error term. The dependent variable of this model was the absolute change from baseline total 
MFM32 score and the fixed effects of the model included variables of the baseline total MFM32 score, 
treatment group (placebo or risdiplam), time (i.e., relative to the first dose of randomised study 
medication in weeks-categorical), treatment-by-time interaction, baseline-by-time interaction and the 
randomisation stratification variable of age (categorical: 2 to 5, 6 to 11, 12 to 17, and 18 to 25 years 
at randomisation). The random effect will include the subject/patient effect. Time was treated as a 
repeated variable within a patient (random effects). Patient, treatment, and time were treated as 
factor variables and baseline total MFM32 score as covariate.  
An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was applied to model the within-patient variability (Σεi) in 
the MMRM model. The components of variance and covariance matrix were estimated by the restricted 
maximum likelihood method. Denominator degrees of freedom were estimated using the Kenward - 
Roger approximation (Kenward & Roger 2009). If the model does not converge, a heterogeneous 
autoregressive variance-covariance matrix will then be applied to model the within-patient variability in 
the above model. The estimated treatment difference in the mean change from baseline in the total 
MFM score at Month 12 between risdiplam and placebo was presented with 95% CI. 
Secondary endpoints: All analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints were performed on data in 
Part 2 up to 12 months for each individual. MMRM analyses were performed for all continuous 
secondary endpoints similar to that specified for the primary analysis. Logistic regression models 
including baseline total score, treatment and age group as independent variables were used to analyse 
all secondary binary endpoints. All secondary endpoints were also summarised descriptively at each 
timepoint (at each scheduled assessment visit) by treatment group. For further details on the analysis 
of the secondary endpoints, please refer to Section 4.4.2 of the SAP. 
Adjustment for Multiple Testing 
To control the Type I error rate due to multiple testing of risdiplam versus placebo for the primary and 
the six key secondary efficacy endpoints in the ITT population, a gatekeeping approach was applied to 
the seven null hypotheses which were grouped into six families  The hypotheses to be tested were 
ordered hierarchically and the truncated Hochberg procedure was used in the family which contains 
more than one hypothesis.

Figure 40: Decision Tree for Part 2 Key Efficacy Endpoints for Hierarchical Testing 
The unadjusted p-value is the p-value obtained when an endpoint is tested at 5% significant level. The 
adjusted p-values were derived based on all the (unadjusted) p values from endpoints in order of the 
hierarchy up to the current endpoint. Hence, the adjusted p-value of the primary endpoint is the same 
as its unadjusted p value. For endpoints that are not included in the hierarchy, the unadjusted p-
values are presented (denoted by p-value in the results section). 
Sensitivity Analysis 
As a supportive analysis to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results based on the MMRM, 
sensitivity analyses, the tipping point analyses were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
change from baseline in MFM32 at Month 12 for the primary hypothetical efficacy estimand and for the 
treatment policy estimand. 
Subgroup Analyses 
The consistency of the primary efficacy endpoint and key efficacy endpoints (all secondary endpoints 
up to Family 4 in the hierarchical testing) were explored for the following subgroups:

Changes to Planned Analyses after Database Lock 
By the CCOD, there were 2 patients randomised to risdiplam with observed delayed puberty at 
baseline and no delayed puberty observed in any patients at post-baseline timepoints. As the results 
shown in the delayed puberty summary tables are the same for the placebo-controlled period and the 
all exposure to risdiplam treatment period, analysis on the all exposure to risdiplam treatment period 
was not performed. In addition, the analysis on the shift of the delayed puberty status from baseline to 
post-baseline timepoints for the placebo-controlled and all exposure to risdiplam treatment periods 
were not performed. Moreover, the number and percentage of patients with Tanner staging results 
within each stage (categorised by Stage I to Stage V) for post-baseline timepoints have not been 
summarised. Instead, a listing of all available Tanner staging and delayed puberty results for all 
applicable patients was created. 
In addition, the normal range for patients age >12 years of the Diastolic Blood Pressure (vital signs) 
was based on 40-90 instead of 40-120 (previously stated in the SAP). 
Since less than 5% of the ITT population were excluded from the primary analysis, the analysis on the 
imputation of the missing MFM items (as specified as a sensitivity analysis in the SAP) was not 
performed. 
Additional analyses were performed, which included: 
-  MMRM analysis on the change from baseline in the total score of RULM at Month 12, by converting 
all item I scores of 2 into 1, and by age group. 
-  MMRM analysis on the change from baseline in absolute FVC (best value) in litres at Month 12. 
-  Responder analysis on the change from baseline in the total score of ≥0 at Month 12 by age group 
for MFM32, HFMSE and RULM

Results 
Participant flow  
Part 2 
The first patient was randomised on 09 October 2017. The date of last patient last visit (LPLV) for the 
placebo-controlled, double-blind period was 06 September 2019. A total of 211 patients were screened 
for Part 2 of the study; of these, 31 patients were screen failures. Reasons for screen failure were 
mostly exclusion criteria or lack of cooperation for OCT examination. 
Figure 41: Patient Disposition Flowchart 
A total of 117 patients (97.5%) in the risdiplam arm and 59 patients (98.3%) in the placebo arm 
completed the placebo-controlled period. 
At the time of the CCOD, 4 patients had discontinued the study during the placebo controlled period; 3 
patients (2.5%) in the risdiplam arm, and 1 patient (1.7%) in the placebo arm. All 4 patients 
discontinued in order to switch to other treatment, specified as nusinersen in 3 patients, and not 
further specified in 1 patient.

Protocol deviations 
Stringent criteria were applied for the evaluation of major protocol deviations given the vulnerability of 
the study population. As of the CCOD, 93 major protocol deviations (65 deviations in the risdiplam arm 
and 28 deviations in the placebo arm) were recorded in 62 patients (20 placebo- and 42 risdiplam-
treated patients, respectively) during the whole treatment period.  One ambulant patient was included 
by a site in error.  
None of these protocol deviations are considered to impact the safety of patients in the trial or the 
interpretation of the efficacy results. 
In conclusion, the number and type of major protocol deviations did not impact the wellbeing of the 
study participants, the integrity of the data, or the subsequent safety or exploratory efficacy analyses. 
Baseline data 
PART 2 
A total of 211 patients were screened for Part 2 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH); of these, only 31 
patients (14.7%) failed screening. A total of 180 patients with Type 2 or non-ambulant Type 3 SMA 
were enrolled from 14 different countries across the US, Europe, Asia and the rest of the world. Of the 
180 patients, 120 patients were randomised to treatment with risdiplam and 60 patients to placebo. 
The median age of patients at screening was 9.0 years (range 2−25 years) in the risdiplam arm and 
9.0 (range: 2−24 years) in the placebo arm. Overall, 68 patients (37.8%) were 12 years or older at 
screening. In each arm, approximately 50% of patients were male. The majority of the population 
were White (RIS: 66.7%; PLB: 68.3%) and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (95.0% in each arm). 
Of the 180 patients in the ITT population, 128 patients (71.1%) had Type 2 SMA and 52 patients 
(28.9%) had Type 3 SMA. The proportion of Type 2 SMA patients was similar in the risdiplam (70.0%) 
and placebo (73.3%) arms. The majority of patients (87.2%) had 3 copies of the SMN2 gene (RIS: 
Assessment report

89.2%; PLB: 83.3%). The median age of onset of initial SMA symptoms, as reported by the parents or 
patients, was 12.3 months (range: 0−57 months) in the risdiplam treatment arm and 12.8 months 
(range: 6−135 months) in the placebo arm. The median time between onset of initial SMA symptoms 
to first treatment (disease duration at baseline) was 106.3 months (min−max: 17−275 months) in the 
risdiplam arm and 96.6 months (min−max: 1−271 months) in the placebo arm.

n is the number of patients with valid observations after missing data rules applied.  
Baseline is the last measurement prior to patient’s first dose of risdiplam.  
a The RULM total score ranges from 0 to 37. In 49 data points out of 720, the item I of the RULM 
scale was scored as 2 – for this item the maximum score is 1. Additional sensitivity analyses were 
performed to assess the impact of using the maximum score of 1 instead of 2 for these 49 data 
points (28 patients). The results of these sensitivity analyses showed consistency with the main 
analysis. 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics appear balanced in the overall population enrolled in 
SUNFISH Part 2, between the control and treatment groups.  
Numbers analysed 
PART 2 
The applicant states that all efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population. 115/120 randomised 
patients in the risdiplam group and 59/60 patient in the PBO group were included in the primary 
analysis. The six patients were excluded from the primary analysis due to missing MFM32 total scores 
at baseline: 5 patients randomised to risdiplam had between 2 and 13 items missing and 1 patient 
randomised to placebo had 3 items missing. The MFM32 missing data rules were based on input from 
an expert who is a part of the MFM group. The ambulant patient randomised to risdiplam was also one 
of the six patients excluded from the primary analysis because of missing MFM32 total score at 
baseline. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by imputing missing MFM32 item scores at baseline, 
based on the mean of the completed items in the same Domain for the same patient. The results were 
consistent with the results of the primary analysis.  Efficacy results presented as a single p value 
represent the unadjusted p.

Motor Function 
Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM32) 
Risdiplam treatment was associated with improvement in patients’ motor function as compared to 
placebo, as demonstrated by the changes on the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint in Part 2 of 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) was the change from baseline in the MFM32 total score at Month 12, which 
was both clinically meaningful and statistically significantly different from patients receiving placebo 
(least square difference in the mean [95% CI] changes from baseline: 1.55 [0.30, 2.81]; p=0.0156). 
Change from baseline in MFM32 total score showed an improvement in the risdiplam group [change 
from baseline, LS means: 1.36 (95% CI: 0.61-2.11)], compared to a worsening observed in the PBO 
group [-0.19 (95% CI:-1.22, 0.84)].   
The proportion of patients with a marked improvement in MFM32 total score ≥3 points was the second 
endpoint in the statistical hierarchy, and was achieved by 38.3% in the risdiplam arm and 23.7% in 
the placebo arm (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.35 [1.01, 5.44]; unadjusted p=0.0469, adjusted p=0.0469). 
An improvement on the MFM32 of ≥3 points represents an improvement for patients, such as the full 
acquisition of a new function or ability or significant improvement in performance of several functions.  
Figure 42: Proportion of Patients Achieving Change from Baseline in MFM32 Total Score at 
Month 12 (Placebo-Controlled Period) (Part 2; ITT Population) 
The improvement in MFM32 total score with risdiplam treatment observed at Month 12 seems to 
detach from the natural history of the disease, where motor function as measured by the MFM is seen 
to decline over time. In an observational, retrospective, multicentre cohort study that assessed the 
ability of the Motor Function Measure (MFM-32) to detect changes in the progression of spinal muscular 
atrophy in 12 untreated patients with SMA type 2 and 19 untreated patients with SMA type 3  patients 
aged 5.7 to 59 years, the overall slope of decline over time using the MFM32 total score was in the 
range of −0.9 (± SD 1.5) points/year for Type 2 SMA patients and −0.6 (± SD 4) points/year for Type 
3 patients (Vuillerot et al. 2013).

Figure 43: Least-Squares Mean Change from Baseline and 95% Confidence Interval in 
MFM32 Total Score at Each Timepoint up to Month 12 (Placebo-Controlled Period) (Part 2; 
ITT Population) 
A tipping point analysis was performed for the primary hypothetical efficacy estimand to determine the 
delta required to be applied for those patients (n=3) in the risdiplam arm with missing MFM32 total 
scores, due to withdrawal from the study, in order to overturn the primary analysis results. A delta of -
7.75 (representing the tipping point) was required to overturn the primary results, suggesting that 
only a large decline in MFM32 total score for these 3 patients in the risdiplam arm would change the 
conclusion of the primary analysis. 3 out of 174 (1.7%) patients included in the primary analysis for 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) had a reduction ≥-7.75 in the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM32) total 
score from baseline to Month 12. These were 2 patients randomised to risdiplam (with a reduction of 
−13.54 and −11.46, respectively) and 1 patient randomised to placebo (with a reduction of −10.42). 
The applicant provided updated efficacy data at 24 months from Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2, 
through an interim summary with a clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 30-September-2020. The complete 
set of analyses from this CCOD were still ongoing at the time of writing. The complete Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP)-specified statistical analyses will be presented in an update Clinical Study Report 
(CSR). Both Part 1 and Part 2 of Study BP39055 remain ongoing. At the CCOD of 30 September 2020, 
10/60 patients (17%) in the group initially randomised to placebo and 17/120 patients (15%) in the 
group of patients initially randomised to risdiplam (n=120), are excluded from the 24 months MFM32 
analyses. The most frequent reason for missing data at Month 24 assessment was due to restriction 
measures during the COVID-19 pandemic (6 patients initially randomised to PBO and 4 patients 
initially randomised to risdiplam missed the Month 24 assessment due to the COVID-19 pandemic). As 
acknowledged by the applicant, missed visits may have had an impact on the efficacy results.  
As regards to the change from baseline in MFM32 total score (primary endpoint at 12 months), in 
patients treated with risdiplam for 24 months, the mean (95% CI) improvement from baseline in 
MFM32 total score seen at Month 12 (1.65 [0.77, 2.53]) was maintained at Month 24 (1.83 [0.74, 
2.92]). In those patients initially assigned to placebo (mean change from baseline at 12 months during 
PBO: 0.00 [95% CI: -0.94, 0.94]) after switching to risdiplam at Month 12, the mean (95% CI) change 
from baseline in MFM32 total score was 0.31 (-0.65, 1.28) after 12 months of treatment, thus a 
smaller effect (with a 95% CI including zero, absence of effect) was observed in this group in 
comparison to patients initially randomised to risdiplam. In patients initially randomised to risdiplam, 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021

after 12 months of risdiplam treatment, the proportion of patients with Change from Baseline in 
MFM32 Total Scores ≥3 was 32.2%, and the proportion achieving a change from baseline ≥0 was 
58.3%.  
According to the primary efficacy estimand based on a hypothetical treatment strategy assuming no 
prohibited medications intended for treatment of SMA, the only patient that received prohibited 
treatment (nusinersen, Spinraza) prior to withdrawal of the study was excluded from the primary 
analysis. This patient has also been included in the sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint 
applying a treatment policy strategy. This is because the statistical analysis was performed using a 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) which includes all available data for each patient: the patient 
received nusinersen after taking risdiplam for 13 weeks and later discontinued from the study following 
the Week 17 visit. The patient completed the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM32) at baseline and 
Week 17. 
●  Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) 
The change from baseline in the RULM total score at Month 12 was a secondary endpoint in Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH) and the third endpoint in the statistical hierarchy. The improvement in upper limb 
function seen in patients treated with risdiplam at Month 12, as assessed by the RULM, was statistically 
significantly different from patients receiving placebo (least square difference in the mean [95% CI] 
changes from baseline: 1.59 [0.55, 2.62]; unadjusted p=0.0028; adjusted p=0.0469). 
The proportion of patients with an improvement in RULM total score ≥2 points was 47.9% in the 
risdiplam arm and 31.0% in the placebo arm (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.18 [1.05, 4.54]; p=0.0369). 
The proportion of patients with a change from baseline in RULM total score of any threshold ≥0, 
representing stabilisation or improvement in this measure, was greater in those receiving risdiplam 
than in those receiving placebo at all post-baseline scheduled assessment visits up to Month 12. At 
Month 12, the proportion of patients with a change in RULM total score ≥0 points was 72.3% in the 
risdiplam arm and 56.9% in the placebo arm, representing a clinically meaningful difference between 
arms (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.93 [0.98, 3.79]; p=0.0555). 
The proportion of patients achieving a change from baseline in RULM total score ≥3 was greater in the 
risdiplam arm (37.8%) than in the placebo arm (17.2%) at Month 12 (odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.27 
[1.40, 7.63]; p=0.0061). Likewise, the proportion of patients achieving a change from baseline in the 
RULM total score ≥4 was greater in those receiving risdiplam (26.9%) than those receiving placebo 
(10.3%) (odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.58 [1.29, 9.99]; p=0.0147). 
A longitudinal study (Pera et al, 2019), previously reported that over 12 months, the mean change in 
RULM score was −0.4 (SD: 2.93) in Type 2 and Type 3 patients aged 2.7 to 49.7 years. Approximately 
2/3 of the whole cohort had changes within ±2 points, with type 3 patients remaining stable more 
often (73%) than type 2 (63%).

In the initial submission, only very limited data are available for the primary endpoint, beyond 12 
months (n=8 patients, observed at week 78, all in the risdiplam group).  Differently from what 
observed at 12 months, at 18 months (week 78) the mean change from baseline shows a worsening 
trend (mean change from baseline: -0.65 (95% CI -2.98, 1.67).

Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) 
The change from baseline in the HFMSE total score at Month 12 was a secondary endpoint in Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH). There was a numerically greater improvement in motor function as assessed by 
the HFMSE seen in patients treated with risdiplam compared to patients receiving placebo at Month 12, 
however, the treatment difference was not significant at this time point (least square difference in the 
mean [95% CI] changes from baseline: 0.58 [-0.53, 1.69]; unadjusted p=0.3015; adjusted 
p=0.3902). The small change seen in HFMSE was expected for the enrolled population, with significant 
fixed SMA-related disabilities and very low motor function scores at baseline (e.g., 41% had HFMSE 
baseline scores below 10, illustrating substantial weakness). Improvement observed in the HFMSE with 
risdiplam (+0.95 change from baseline at Month 12) seems to detach from the natural history.  
Natural history data from Type 2 and Type 3 patients aged 2-45 years collected using the HFMSE 
shows a change of 0.08 points over the course of 12 months, a decline of -0.24 points after 24 
months, and a decline of -2.31 points after 36 months, on average (Kaufmann et al. 2012). Another 
study of Type 2 and Type 3 patients aged 2.5 to 55 years, including ambulant and non-ambulant 
individuals, demonstrated that the overall slope of decline in the HFSME total score over a 12-month 
period is -0.57 in non-ambulant patients (Mercuri et al. 2016). The change in HFMSE varied across age 
groups: +0.04 in children <5 years, -0.96 in children and adolescents aged ≥5 to <15 years, and -
0.35 in adolescents ≥15 years (Mercuri et al. 2016). 
In a recent study (Mercuri et al 2019) in a cohort of 28 untreated patients with type II SMA, the rate of 
progression measured as annual changes was apparently higher in the group with highest baseline 
HFMSE scores and lower in the patients with low scores at baseline because they had fewer points to 
lose. This study confirmed that, despite the variability in changes and the possibility of improvement in 
the first years of life, all patients with type II SMA show a clear and progressive decline on the long-
term follow-up, regardless of their scores at baseline. 
Respiratory Outcomes 
Forced Vital Capacity 
FVC was assessed in patients aged ≥6 years at screening. There was no clinically relevant or 
statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline in FVC (best percentage of 
predicted) between risdiplam (mean [SD]: −5.16% [1.40%]) and placebo (mean [SD]: −3.11% 
[1.94%]) at Month 12 (least square difference in the mean [95% CI] changes from baseline: −2.05% 
[−6.67%, 2.56%]; unadjusted p=0.3804; adjusted p=0.3902)  
The absolute value analysis showed that there was no clinically significant change in FVC in either the 
risdiplam or placebo arm (least square difference in the mean [95% CI] changes from baseline: −0.01 
[−0.11, 0.08]; p=0.7651) 
Patient/Caregiver-Reported Outcomes 
SMA Independence Scale (SMAIS) 
Complementary evidence of the benefit of risdiplam treatment seen in the key motor function 
assessments was also observed by the SMAIS. Change from baseline in the 22-item upper limb total

Numerical improvements in SMAIS total scores with risdiplam compared to placebo were observed in 
both the caregiver observer-reported assessment (least square difference in the mean [95% CI] 
changes from baseline: 2.55 [0.93, 4.17]; unadjusted p=0.0022; adjusted p=0.3902) and the patient 
self-reported assessment (least square difference in the mean [95% CI] changes from baseline: 1.45

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Due to the different age ranges of patients included in the two pivotal studies (as a consequence of the 
different age of onset of symptoms across the different SMA types), each study utilises different 
assessment scales for motor function and, hence, efficacy data have not been pooled across the pivotal 
studies.

Risdiplam efficacy was observed in patients with both Type 2 and Type 3 SMA; this was confirmed by 
improvements in the MFM32 and the RULM at Month 12 in both of these subgroups as compared to 
placebo. 
In total, 128 (71.1%) Type 2 patients and 52 (28.9%) Type 3 patients were included in Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2. Of these, 84 (70.0%) Type 2 patients and 36 (30.0%) Type 3 patients 
received risdiplam, and 44 (73.3%) Type 2 patients and 16 (26.7%) Type 3 patients received placebo.  
As measured by the difference in change from baseline in MFM32 total score with risdiplam compared 
to placebo at Month 12, for both SMA Type 2 patients (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 1.54 
[0.06, 3.02]) and SMA Type 3 patients (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 1.49 [−0.94, 3.93]), 
risdiplam showed treatment benefit. 
Similarly, this treatment benefit in both SMA types was also demonstrated in the RULM. The difference 
in change from baseline in RULM total score with risdiplam compared to placebo at Month 12 in both 
SMA Type 2 patients (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 1.19 [−0.03, 2.42]) and SMA Type 3 
patients (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 2.36 [0.42, 4.29]) shows evidence of gains in upper 
limb function with risdiplam.

There was concordance between Part 1 and Part 2 results, despite the fact that in Part 2 more sites 
from different continents contributed to the enrolment of more patients than Part 1, and that in Part 1 
patients received two different doses of risdiplam. Key efficacy results from Part 1 and Part 2 at Month 
12 are summarised below:

defined for these endpoints in Part 2, because the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI in each case is 
above the performance criterion defined for each endpoint in the Part 2 SAP. 
18-months survival, Part 1 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
At data cut-off (CCOD: 14 November 2019), the maximum exposure for an individual patient in Part 1 
of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) was 34.6 months (range of 0.6 to 34.6 months). 18 out of 21 patients 
(85.7%) were alive at Month 18 without requiring permanent ventilation. The 3 patients who died 
during Part 1 of the study were aged from 175 to 211 days at enrolment, and none of them required 
permanent ventilation. One additional patient withdrew from study treatment due to non-safety related 
reasons on Day 585 (the patient was censored at this timepoint). Approximately 3.5 months after 
treatment discontinuation, the patient presented SMA-related complications and passed away. After a 
minimum of 24 months of treatment, 81% (17/21) of patients were alive and event-free and reached 
an age of 28 months or older (median 32 months; range 28 to 45 months), see Figure below.

SUNFISH Part 1:  comparison with external sources 
Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) does not have a placebo control group beyond the initial minimum 
12-week dose-selection period. Data available from the NatHis-SMA Study (Study BP29540: a 
prospective, longitudinal and interventional study of the natural history of patients with Type 2 and 3 
SMA) and the placebo arm of Study WN29836 (a previous Phase 2 SMA study for a discontinued 
development compound, olesoxime) have been used as an external control comparator to enable 
formal comparisons for the Motor Function Measure (MFM) endpoint, the primary endpoint of Part 2. 
Patients in the 3 studies received a similar standard of care and there was overlap in the sites that

participated in each of the studies. Furthermore, the baseline characteristics of the patients in these 
studies were similar. 
Patients in the NatHis-SMA Study 
The NatHis-SMA Study is a European, prospective, multicentre, longitudinal natural history study of 
Type 2 and Type 3 SMA conducted at 9 reference centres for neuromuscular diseases in France, 
Belgium, and Germany between May 2015 and May 2018. The study is an investigator-sponsored, 
Roche-supported study run by the French Institute of Myology (Study BP29540; NCT02391831). The 
primary objective of this study is to characterise the disease course in SMA Type 2 and Type 3 patients 
using standardised evaluations including the MFM. The study included 81 patients aged between 2 and 
29 years. The maximum duration for participation for each patient was 24 months and patients were 
evaluated every 6 months. 
Roche performed an interim analysis of the data from the NatHis-SMA Study collected at Month 12 and 
a final analysis at Month 24.  
Placebo Control Group in the Olesoxime Study WN29836 
Study WN29836 (NCT01302600) was a Phase 2, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomised, 
double-blind, adaptive, multicentre, and multinational study designed to assess the efficacy and safety 
of olesoxime 10 mg/kg daily over a period of 2 years in patients aged 3 to 25 years with Type 2 or 
non-ambulatory Type 3 SMA from sites in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, 
and the United Kingdom. 
The study was originally sponsored by Trophos S.A. and subsequently wholly acquired by Roche and 
included 165 patients, of which 57 were randomised to placebo (Bertini et al. 2017). Olesoxime 
development has since been discontinued. 
The placebo arm of this study was utilised as a second data source for generating the external 
comparator population for the comparative analysis with risdiplam-treated patients in Part 1 of Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH) after 12 and 24 months. 
Statistical Methods: 
In order to compare the MFM results from Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) with data from the two 
external control groups described above, the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) 
approach based on propensity scores was used. The individual patient data from the external control 
groups were weighted using key prognostic factors (age at enrolment, SMA type, SMN2 copy number, 
ambulatory status, scoliosis, MFM total score at baseline, and MFM scale). This allowed a comparison of 
the treated and untreated groups with similar prognostic factors. The main analyses were performed 
comparing the risdiplam group (treated) with the pooled external control group (untreated). 
ENDPOINTS ASSESSED IN THE COMPARISON OF STUDY BP39055 (SUNFISH) WITH 
EXTERNAL CONTROL DATA: 
In the comparison of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 1 with external control data, analyses were based 
on efficacy as assessed by the MFM. The MFM scale was not assessed in the same way in Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 1, the NatHis-SMA study, and Study WN29836, the MFM total score was 
derived based on the MFM32 total score for patients aged ≥6 years and the MFM20 total score for 
patients age <6 years (both transformed to 0-100 scale). 
More specifically, all patients in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH Part 1) were to be assessed using the 
MFM32 regardless of age. Patients under the age of 6 years in the NatHis-SMA study and the placebo 
arm of Study WN29836 were assessed using the MFM20 and patients aged 6 years and over were to 
perform MFM32. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 173/293 
 
 
The MFM20 scale consists of 20 items and the MFM32 scale consists of 32 items. The MFM20 total 
score and MFM32 total score were calculated according to the user manual. The MFM20 total score was 
calculated by summing the 20 item scores and transforming this onto a 0-100 scale (i.e., sum of 20 
item scores divided by 60 and multiplied by 100) and the MFM32 total score was calculated by 
summing the 32 item scores and transforming this onto 0-100 scale (i.e., sum of 32 item scores 
divided by 96 and multiplied by 100). One raw point on the MFM20 scale translates to 1.66 in the 
MFM20 total score and one raw point on the MFM32 scale translates to 1.04 in the MFM32 total score. 
Using the MFM20 total score for those aged under 6 years and the MFM32 total score for those aged 6 
years or above, the resulting score was defined as the ‘MFM total score’. To make the studies more 
comparable, the change from baseline in the MFM total score was derived based on MFM32 for all 
patients aged 6 years or above and MFM20 for all patients aged less than 6 years old; for visits where 
the MFM32 was used in patients aged less than 6 years, the 12 additional items which are not included 
in the MFM20 did not count towards the scoring algorithm. 
Key efficacy endpoints assessed in the comparison with external control data included: 
- Change from baseline in MFM total score at Month 12 and Month 24 
- Proportion of patients with a change from baseline in MFM total score ≥3 points at Month 24 
- Proportion of patients with a change from baseline in MFM total score ≥0 points at Month 24. 
Only patients with an MFM assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment at Month 
12 or Month 24 were included in the analysis. The patients meeting these criteria from the two 
external control studies formed the external comparator population. 
The change from baseline in the MFM total score at Month 12 and Month 24 were analysed based on 
the mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) model. The proportion of patients who achieved an 
improvement of ≥0 and ≥3 on the MFM total score was analysed at Month 24 using logistic regression 
models. This responder analysis was based on patients with valid assessments, which included only 
patients with MFM total scores at both baseline and Month 24. 
Sensitivity responder analyses were performed by considering patients as non-responders if patients 
withdrew or had a missing MFM total score at Month 24. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was performed 
comparing the results from Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) against each of the external control 
groups separately. Both weighted and unweighted analyses were conducted for each of the three 
comparisons. The weighting approach used gave more weight to a patient in the external control group 
who had a more similar covariate profile to a patient in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH). The outcome 
results for each individual were then multiplied by their corresponding weights for the weighted 
analyses. 
Study Populations 
Patients Included in the Analysis 
A total of 123 patients from the NatHis-SMA Study and the placebo arm of Study WN29836 had a 
baseline MFM total score and at least one post-baseline MFM total score at Month 12 or Month 24 and, 
thus, were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Of these, 14 patients were excluded from the external 
control population, 12 due to missing prognostic factors and 2 with an SMN2 gene copy number of 2 
(as Study BP39055 [SUNFISH] Part 1 included no patients with copy number of 2 in the comparison 
with the external control). Therefore, a total of 109 patients (patients eligible for weighting) were 
included in the external control arm of the analysis. 
A total of 48 patients from Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) were included in the analysis. One 
patient had withdrawn from the study prior to the Month 12 visit and was excluded from this analysis. 
Assessment report

Two additional patients were excluded after trimming due to no overlap of distributions in the 
propensity scores.

Prolonged exposure to risdiplam was associated with improvement and stabilisation in patients’ motor 
function. At Month 24, more than half (54.2%) of patients in Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
achieved an improvement from baseline in MFM total score of ≥3 compared with only 16.8% in the 
external control group (odds ratio [95% CI]: 6.63 [2.06, 21.33]; p=0.0015). The majority of patients 
(81.3%) achieved a change from baseline ≥0 in the MFM, representing stabilisation or improvement in 
this measure, compared to 44.4% of those from the external control group (odds ratio [95% CI]: 5.63 
[1.93, 16.40]; p=0.0016).

Note: The sum of weights used for the weighted analysis at Month 12 is different to the sum of weights 
used at Month 24. This is because more patients had dropped out of the external control group by 
Month 24 compared with Month 12. Conversely, only one patient discontinued from Part 1 of Study 
BP39055 (SUNFISH) by Month 24.

Results from the unweighted analysis are consistent to those described above for the weighted 
analysis, and are described in the Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 1 - Comparison with External 
Control Summary Report in Module 5. 
Results from the separate weighted analysis comparisons of 1) Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
with the observational NatHis-SMA Study and 2) Part 1 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) with the placebo 
arm of Study WN29836 were generally in agreement with the above results, supporting the robustness 
of the conclusions. Detailed results of these individual analyses are available in the Study BP39055 
(SUNFISH) Part 1 - Comparison with External Control Summary Report. 
Study BP39054(JEWELFISH)  
This is an open-label, non-comparative study in SMA patients previously enrolled in Roche Study 
BP29420 (MOONFISH) with the splicing modifier RO6885247 (development discontinued), or 
previously treated with SPINRAZA (nusinersen), ZOLGENSMA (onasemnogene abeparvovec, AVXS-
101), or olesoxime (previous Roche-acquired development compound, which has since been 
discontinued) in which treatment with risdiplam is evaluated over a 24-month period. Study enrolment 
has been completed with 174 patients; these 174 patients had previously received either nusinersen 
(N=76), RO6885247 (N=13), olesoxime (N=71), or AVXS-101 (N=14). Due to the limited treatment 
duration for most patients in this ongoing study at the CCOD (median treatment duration at the CCOD 
of 31 January 2020 was 3.0 months), efficacy results from Study BP39054 (JEWELFISH) are yet not 
available.

Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in patients with 1 to 4 copies of 
the SMN2 gene 
The applicant responded to the CHMP’s request to discuss the conduct of a non-interventional post-
authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in patients with 1 to 4 copies of the SMN2 gene.   
The design of the PAES requires careful consideration to ensure the generation of meaningful data for 
the Agency and prescribers. The study is intended to address the CHMP’s proposed overall objective to 
further characterise and contextualise the outcomes of patients with a genetic confirmation of 
diagnosis of SMA, including long-term safety and efficacy of Evrysdi.  
The applicant proposed a prospective observational study in approximately 300 patients with SMA, 
both symptomatic and pre-symptomatic, that will use data from existing disease registries 
supplemented by a study specific registry collecting additional efficacy and safety data for a minimum 
follow-up of 5 years. Data from EU countries will be the primary source for this study.  
A clinical trial in pre-symptomatic SMA infants with any SMN2 copy number is currently ongoing (Study 
BN40703 [RAINBOWFISH]). In this study, the total follow-up duration will be at least 5 years for each 
infant, which will provide long-term efficacy and safety data of risdiplam in pre-symptomatic patients. 
Data from this study will be supplemented by the PAES. 
The applicant’s considerations and proposed outline of the PAES are detailed below.   
Proposed Study Objectives 
As the main objective of the study, the applicant proposes to evaluate disease progression in SMA 
patients (both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic) with 1 to 4 SMN2 copies treated with risdiplam, in 
comparison to natural history data in untreated patients with similar SMN2 copy numbers.  
The PAES will focus on further characterizing: 
● 
● 
● 
 outcomes in patients treated with risdiplam at a pre-symptomatic stage,  
 patients with 4 SMN2 copies,  
 long-term efficacy and safety outcomes in SMA patients.  
Study Design and Data Sources 
The applicant agreed with the study design proposed by CHMP, i.e. a multinational, multicentric, 
prospective observational study. Given the availability of licensed SMN-targeted treatments and the 
devastating disease course in most cases if patients are left untreated, a single arm study, where 
results will be compared with natural history data, is considered to be the most appropriate.  
With regards to data sources, a hybrid approach is proposed: data will be obtained from existing 
registries and supplemented by an additional study specific registry collecting fit-for-purpose data in 
order to obtain meaningful information in a timely fashion.  
There are well established SMA disease registries with participating EU member states which represent 
an important source of information on patients, treatments, standard of care and outcomes over time. 
These registries include but are not limited to: 
• 
Translational Research in Europe for the Assessment and Treatment of Neuromuscular 
Disorders (TREAT-NMD): an EU-funded network of excellence for genetic neuromuscular 
diseases with a particular focus on SMA that collects data from national/regional registries 
(TREAT-NMD). 
• 
The international Spinal Muscular Atrophy consortium (iSMAc): an academic collaboration 
linking 3 national networks (Italy, United States and the United Kingdom), collecting prospective 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 181/293 
 
 
data focused on the natural history in infants, children and adults affected by SMA. Data from the 
iSMAc registry are contributing to the real-world assessment of the contemporary natural history 
and response to emerging therapies in a broadly based population of patients with SMA (Mercuri 
et al. 2019). 
• 
SMArtCARE: a platform collecting real-world longitudinal data on all available SMA patients 
independent of their actual treatment regime as a disease-specific SMA registry. For this purpose, 
SMArtCARE provides an online platform for SMA patients seen by health-care providers in 
Germany, Austria and Switzerland. All data are collected during routine patient visits. Items for 
data collection are aligned with the international consensus for SMA registries (Pechmann et al. 
2019). 
Data sources landscaping will be conducted by the applicant across the EU in order to explore any 
additional relevant sources for patient enrolment and data collection for the PAES.  
Suitable registries will be identified to meet the regulatory needs for the PAES based on the availability 
of appropriate outcome measures, the possibility of including additional variables, the quality of data 
and the possibility of accessing individual patient-level data (need for collaboration agreements).  
Given that SMA is a rare disease, other registries that collect data outside of the EU (e.g. US- or 
Canada-based) may be considered in the evaluation of suitable data sources. However, the 
predominant population of the study is planned to be EU-based.  
Proposed Population and Sample Size 
It is estimated that the study will enrol approximately 300 patients treated with risdiplam with a 
diagnosis of SMA, including both symptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients. The final sample size will 
be determined based on outcome measures, statistical considerations, availability of risdiplam 
(national reimbursement policies and timelines), local clinical guidelines and preferred treatments by 
patients/families and physicians.  
The study will collect longitudinal data in a broad population of risdiplam treated patients genetically 
diagnosed with SMA and with up to 4 SMN2 copies in a real-life environment. To ensure a 
representative overall population, the study will include both pre-symptomatic, newly diagnosed 
patients and patients with more advanced disease.  
Outcome Measures 
The proposed PAES aims to demonstrate maintenance or achievement of motor milestones and motor 
function with risdiplam treatment that are clinically meaningful and deviate from the natural history of 
the disease. The Applicant plans to use a different set of outcome measures for different age groups 
and clinical presentation, as their disease evolution is also expected to be different. The choice of 
outcome measures will also be determined by how widely available their use is in a real-world setting 
and their inclusion in the core dataset of the registries selected for inclusion in the PAES. 
The following outcome measures are considered for evaluation:  
● 
● 
Survival and ventilation-free survival (all patients) 
CHOP-INTEND in patients up to 2 years of age 
●  Motor milestones (WHO motor milestones) 
●  MFM32 (if already available in the core dataset of included registries) 
● 
● 
● 
HFMSE scale in patients from 2 years of age  
RULM scale in patients from 2 years of age 
Timed function tests (for high functioning patients, e.g. ambulatory) 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 182/293 
 
 
In addition, in pre-symptomatic patients treated with risdiplam, it will be important to clinically identify 
the timing of initiation of SMA symptoms (e.g. proximal skeletal muscle weakness) in order to show 
deviation from the expected phenotype.  
Additional data will be collected longitudinally in line with local clinical practices in the participating 
sites in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients, including but not limited to: demographics, 
genetic test results, date of SMA symptom onset/diagnosis, past medical history, respiratory support, 
nutritional support, growth parameters, orthopaedic problems (e.g. scoliosis, contractures), previous 
surgeries and safety.  
Statistical Analysis  
The analysis population will consist of all enrolled patients.  
Consistent with the observational nature of this registry, no formal a priori hypothesis testing will be 
performed.  
The outcome measures will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Continuous data will be 
summarised using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarised using counts and percentages. Event-free survival 
will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods.  
Subgroup analysis will be performed by SMN2 copy number.  
Efficacy outcome measures will be compared to and put in context with natural history. In addition, a 
comparison will be made between pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients receiving risdiplam 
following appropriate matching on relevant variables (e.g. SMN2 copy number).  
With the goal to provide meaningful data that can be analysed on an ongoing basis, an initial interim 
analysis will be conducted once all patients have been enrolled and have completed one year of follow-
up. Subsequent interim analyses will be conducted yearly thereafter. The final analysis will be 
conducted when all enrolled patients have completed the study. 
Further details, including methods for dealing with missing data, will be pre-specified in a statistical 
analysis plan.  
Study Duration and Expected Milestones 
The duration of the study should take into account the disease epidemiology and correlation between 
SMN2 copy number and expected SMA phenotype. This correlation is important in order to predict the 
likely disease evolution and plan for adequate study duration to be able to detect a divergence from 
this trajectory, especially when patients are treated with risdiplam at a pre-symptomatic stage. 
Specifically, the majority of patients with 1 to 2 SMN2 copies (96% of those with 1 SMN2 copy and 
79% of those with 2 SMN2 copies) are expected to present with Type 1 SMA. From patients with 3 
SMN2 copies, 54% will develop SMA Type 2, 31% Type 3, and 15% Type 1. Finally, when considering 
patients with 4 SMN2 copies, 82% will develop Type 3 SMA and 11% Type 2 (Calucho et al. 2018) 1. 
The usual age of onset of symptoms of different SMA subtypes is also relevant when estimating the 
required duration of the study, i.e. patients with Type 1 SMA present with symptoms between birth 
and 6 months, patients with Type 2 between 7 and 18 months, patients with Type 3a between 18 and 
36 months, and patients with Type 3b above 3 years.  
Based on the above, the applicant proposes a study duration of 8 years, i.e. a 2 to 3-year enrolment 
1 In patients with 4 SMN2 copies, from the Calucho et al. (2018) paper we reference the literature compilation/worldwide 
series (n=2834) results as in the Spanish cohort, patients of Type 3 and Type 4 SMA are grouped together. The percentage 
"82%" is derived from Figure 2b and Supplementary Fig.S2, excluding patients with 4 SMN2 copies who had Type 4 SMA 
(n=21).

period followed by a minimum 5-year follow-up. This study duration will provide adequate time to 
observe effects in the majority of patients enrolled. 
The protocol will be submitted within 6 months of CHMP Opinion. Following initiation of the study, an 
update on recruitment status will provided yearly. 
The first interim study report will be provided once all patients have been enrolled and have completed 
one year of follow-up, and subsequent interim reports will be submitted yearly thereafter until study 
completion. Based on the proposed study duration, the estimated date for submission of the final study 
report is 2030. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
SMA type 1: FIREFISH STUDY 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) is an open label, two-part, multi-centre, single arm study, conducted in 
infants  with Type 1 SMA. Inclusion criteria allowed enrolment of infants aged 1 to 7 months, however, 
the youngest patient actually enrolled was 2.2 months old. Thus, no data are currently available in 
infants below 2 months of age. 
The study consists of a dose-finding Part 1 and a confirmatory Part 2, at the dose selected based on 
data obtained in Part 1. Following selection of the dose for Part 2, patients in Part 1 entered an 
extension phase to continue treatment at the dose selected for Part 2 (referred to as the pivotal dose). 
Both Parts 1 and 2 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) share the same inclusion/exclusion criteria; however, 
the 21 patients enrolled in Part 1 did not enrol in Part 2 of the study. Therefore, Parts 1 and 2 can be 
considered as two independent studies. The Part 1 open label extension (OLE) phase and Part 2 of the 
study are ongoing. 
FIREFISH Part 1:  A total of 21 patients with Type 1 SMA were enrolled into Part 1 of Study BP39056 
(FIREFISH). Two cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2) were defined based on the target exposure. The dose 
administered in Cohort 2 was the same as the pivotal dose used in Part 2 of the study (target exposure 
of mean AUC0- 24h,ss ≤2000 ng·h/mL), after some initial dose adjustments. At enrolment, the median 
age of all patients in Part 1 was 6.7 months, thus on the older end of the permitted age (range: 3.3-
6.9 months); 15 of 21 patients (71.4%) were older than 5 months. Only 6 infants aged 3.3-5 months 
were enrolled, with higher exposure observed in 3 of these infants, and no data were available in 
infants < 3 months. Therefore, as for Part 1, a dose-escalation approach was chosen for Part 2, with a 
lower starting dose for the younger age groups and dose adjustment upon review of the individual PK 
data. PK samples were obtained from each infant and, based on the actual observed PK in each infant, 
the dose was increased to 0.2 mg/kg for all Part 2 patients (which occurred in general for most infants 
within 2 months of treatment start). 0.2mg/ kg is the recommended dose in the proposed SmPC 
between 2 months to < 2 years of age. 
FIREFISH Part 2: The pivotal trial for SMA Type 1, is Part 2 of Study BP39056 (FIREFISH), a 
single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 symptomatic infants with Type 1 SMA treated for 24 months, 
followed by an OLE. The primary analysis of Part 2 was conducted once the last patient in Part 2 
completed the 12-month assessment [clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 14 November 2019]. Part 2 of the 
study is ongoing. All patients reached 24 months of treatment in November 2020. The applicant states 
that database snapshot is planned in January 2021. The applicant plans to finalise the Clinical Study 
Report presenting this data in April 2021. Results of 24 months endpoints should be provided as soon 
as available.

At the time of study start there were no approved disease-specific treatment options. Thus, the open-
label design of the study may be acceptable, as FIREFISH enrolled a paediatric population with Type 1 
SMA, the most severe form of the disease (thus representing the SMA population with the highest 
medical need) and the natural history of Type 1 SMA is well known, with patients never achieving 
sitting without support.  Nevertheless, the possibility of bias remains because of the open-label nature 
of the study. 
The applicant pre-defined performance criteria for success to be applied in the FIREFISH Part 2 study, 
based on natural history data on primary and secondary endpoints, i.e., a threshold of achievement for 
risdiplam-treated patients to be assessed against. CHMP previously agreed through SA that matching 
on an individual basis may be difficult in this limited and heterogeneous patient population. Therefore, 
the approach for generating performance criteria with a 90% upper and lower limit of the confidence 
interval may be the next best option, but the applicant was encouraged to continue developing the 
best possible understanding and description of the disease course relevant to the population included 
in the trial. Data from the retrospective chart review of infants with Type 1 SMA who have similar 
clinical characteristics to the infants included in FIREFISH Study BP39056, and who received care at 
the same sites (Roche study no. BP39859 ANCHOVY) was foreseen to provide additional context for 
the results of FIREFISH Study BP39056 and have been provided. The pre-defined performance criteria 
for Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) are aligned with survival data observed in Study BP39859 (ANCHOVY). 
The ventilation free survival and survival data observed in Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) show a marked 
difference from those from the untreated patients in Study BP39859 (ANCHOVY), which further 
supports the benefit of risdiplam in Type-1 SMA patients. As regards to HINE-2, the large amount of 
missing data limits the interpretation of the ANCHOVY data. Only 9 patients had a sitting assessment 
at age 12 months (15.0%), 5 patients at 18 months (8.3%) and 3 patients at 36 months (5.0%). 
Sitting without support was not achieved by any patient at any time point, up to age 36 months. 
The population in the NeuroNEXT SMA infant biomarker study (Kolb et al., 2016; Kolb et al., 2017), 
that includes 16 infants with 2 copies of the SMN2 gene, was judged by the applicant to be most 
similar to the expected population in Study BP39056. Whenever possible, the performance criterion 
derived (for the secondary endpoints) from this study was selected as the benchmark to be used for 
hypothesis testing. When data for an endpoint was not available from the NeuroNEXT SMA infant 
biomarker study, the benchmark was derived from the study conducted by De Sanctis et al. (2016), 
that includes 24 infants classified as Type 1B.Through CHMP SA, the plan to assess and analyse the 
primary endpoint at 12 months was agreed. Long-term treatment with risdiplam will be evaluated in 
the ongoing open-label extension phase of clinical trials until a total treatment duration of at least 5 
years. At the time of CHMP scientific advice the applicant assured that long term follow-up was 
planned and will be ensured, either by establishing a patient treatment registry or by utilizing existing 
disease registries (still under consideration at the time of SA).  
Primary endpoint: The proportion of infants that are able to sit without support at 12 months of 
treatment is a relevant primary endpoint, because sitting is a milestone that infants with SMA type I 
never achieve in their natural course of disease. The operational definition of a responder i.e. sitting 
without support for 5 seconds (as assessed by item 22 of the gross motor scale of BSID-III) was 
agreed by CHMP at the time of SA. CHMP requested that this milestone should be persistent and stated 
that a positive result on the primary endpoint -supported by an effect in the other secondary 
endpoints- indicates an effect on disease progression. 
Sitting without support is assessed through two items in the BSID-III Gross Motor Scale: item 22 
assesses sitting without support for at least 5 seconds (primary endpoint chosen for this study); item 
26 assesses sitting without support for at least 30 seconds (listed among secondary endpoints at 
Month 24 in this study). “Sitting alone without support for at least 30 seconds” (Bayley Scales Gross 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 185/293 
 
 
Motor Subset item #26) has been previously used in pivotal SMA trials (Zolgensma).  
The applicant has been requested to discuss the clinical relevance of sitting without support for 5 
seconds; furthermore, the applicant was requested to clarify how the persistence of the milestone 
“sitting without support” has been assessed in FIREFISH trial. Overall, it is understood that sitting is an 
important milestone and provides a step towards cognitive improvement also, expanding horizons and 
releasing the upper limbs. The 5 secs without support is correlated to 30 secs with or without support, 
and to some extent those achieving 5 secs were more likely to reach 30 secs with or without support 
after one more year. Even though in natural history studies sitting without support is never achieved in 
SMA type I patients, data from randomised controlled trials showed that by using different definitions 
of sitting without support within the same trial, different proportions of treated patients reach the 
endpoint.  
In the study protocol, the pre-defined performance criterion for the primary endpoint was 5%. Further 
discussion has been requested on how the 5% criteria was chosen.  
The applicant clarified that the 5% threshold for the primary endpoint was not derived from a specific 
real-world data source in the same way the performance criteria for other endpoints were derived. 
Natural history of the disease shows that infants with Type 1 SMA never achieve sitting without 
support (Zerres and Davies 1999; Cobben et al. 2008; Finkel et al. 2014; De Sanctis et al. 2016). 
However, according to the methodology used by the applicant to define the performance criterion for 
each endpoint, based on available data from natural history studies, the upper limit of the 90% CI 
performance criterion took into consideration the sample size of the selected natural history study. For 
instance, for the alternative definition of sitting without support according to HINE, sitting without 
support after 12 months of follow up was not reached by any of the 24 type I SMA infants in a 
retrospective multicentric study of type I SMA infants (De Sanctis et al., 2016). Based on this natural 
history study, the upper limit of the 90% CI would have been 12%%.  Thus, the applicant position who 
considers the 5% threshold a conservative benchmark for this milestone is not agreed upon. Overall, 
taking into consideration the alternative definition of sitting without support assessed in the study as 
secondary endpoints, the results observed with risdiplam for the milestone sitting without support, 
differ from the natural history data, even though the magnitude of effect is not so significant [sitting 
without support, as assessed by the HINE-2 categories of ‘Stable sit’ and ‘Pivots (rotates)’: 24.4% 
risdiplam (90% CI: 13.9%, 37.9%)  vs upper limit of the 90% CI calculated from DeSanctis et al, 
2016:12%].  
Further discussion was requested on possible scenarios for the primary endpoint set at 30 seconds, 
also through a performance criterion. The applicant states that natural history studies conducted in 
Type 1 SMA have not utilised item 26 of the BSID-III gross motor scale to assess the achievement of 
sitting without support in untreated patients.  However, the applicant emphasises that it is consistently 
reported in natural history studies that infants and children with Type 1 SMA, by definition, will never 
sit independently. In the applicant’s view this means that they will never achieve any duration of 
sitting without support, regardless of the scale used to assess this hallmark. Even though the 
applicant’s argumentation may be partially followed (i.e. in natural history studies sitting without 
support is never achieved in SMA type I patients), data from randomised controlled trials showed that 
by using different definitions of sitting without support within the same trial, different proportions of 
treated patients reach the endpoint.  
The results of the sensitivity analysis still differ from natural history results.  
Secondary endpoints: The proposed definition of motor-milestone responders according to results on 
the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE-2) [improvement in at least one 
category and more categories with improvement than categories with worsening] is considered a 
reasonable secondary endpoint and is the same definition used as coprimary endpoint (together with 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 186/293 
 
 
time to death or permanent ventilation) for Spinraza (nusinersen), approved for SMA in 2017 (pivotal 
trial ENDEAR, Finckel et al 2017). 
The motor milestone “sitting without support” (primary endpoint when assessed through item 22 of the 
BSID-III) was assessed also through the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 
(HINE-2) (secondary endpoint). In this scale the milestone “sitting” is graded in 5 categories [from 0, 
corresponding to inability to sit, to 4 (pivots, rotates)]. The results of the primary analysis are thus 
supported by the results of sensitivity analyses performed using a different scale, with an alternative 
definition of sitting without support [HINE-2 categories 3: ‘Stable sit’ and 4:‘Pivots (rotates)’]. 
The CHOP INTEND is an acceptable neuromuscular evaluation for use as a secondary endpoint. 
Population enrolled: A total of 41 patients with Type 1 SMA were enrolled into Part 2 of pivotal 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) across 14 different sites in 10 countries. At the time of the CCOD, 38 of 41 
patients (92.7%) in Part 2 were still ongoing in the study; these 38 patients were older than 14 
months of age. Three patients (7.3%) died due to SMA related respiratory complications within the 
first three months following enrolment. Of the 41 patients enrolled in Part 2, 22 (53.7%) were female 
and 19 (46.3%) were male. At enrolment, the median age of all patients was 5.3 months (range: 2.2-
6.9 months); 22 of 41 patients (53.7%) were older than 5 months. The median age at diagnosis was 
2.8 months (range: 0.9-6.1 months) and the age at onset of symptoms ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 
months. In accordance with the inclusion criteria, all patients had a genetic diagnosis of SMA (SMN1) 
and had two SMN2 gene copies. At baseline, the median BSID-III Gross Motor Scale score was 2.0 
(range: 0.0-8.0), the median CHOP-INTEND score was 22.0 points (range: 8.0-37.0) and the median 
HINE-2 score was 1.0 point (range 0.0-5.0). Overall, patients enrolled in FIREFISH part II are 
considered representative of the SMA type I patient population, apart from the exclusion of patients 
with the most severe forms as well as not clinically stable patients (the study excluded patients who 
required invasive ventilation or tracheostomy, hypoxemic patients and patients recently hospitalised 
for a pulmonary event). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
FIREFISH Part2:  
Primary endpoint: The proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint (sitting without support 
for ≥5 seconds at 12 months) is higher (12/41, 29.3%) compared to the proportion of patients sitting 
without support for ≥30 seconds at 12 months (7/41, 17.1%).  
As regards to the results of sensitivity analyses performed using an alternative definition of sitting 
without support, at 12 months of treatment, 10 of 41 patients (24.4%; 90% CI: 13.9%, 37.9%) in 
Part 2 were sitting without support, as assessed by the HINE-2 categories of ‘Stable sit’ and ‘Pivots 
(rotates). The HINE has been assessed in a retrospective multicentric study of 33 type I SMA infants 
(De Sanctis et al., 2016), that has been used by the applicant to derive a benchmark for development 
milestones, including sitting without support. None of the 24 subjects in the study by De Sanctis et al, 
2016 achieved the endpoint “sitting without support at 12 months”; the performance criteria (upper 
limit of the 90% CI) was 12%. Thus the results observed with risdiplam for this endpoint differ from 
the natural history data, even though the magnitude of effect is not so significant [24.4% risdiplam 
(90% CI: 13.9%, 37.9%)  vs performance criterion 12%]. 
Secondary endpoints:  
CHOP-INTEND: The proportion of patients achieving a CHOP-INTEND total score of 40 or higher at 12 
months [23/41 patients (56.1%; 90% CI: 42.1%, 69.4%)], as well as the proportion of patients 
achieving an increase of at least 4 points from baseline at 12 months [37/41 patients (90.2%; 90% 
CI: 79.1%, 96.6%)] was significantly higher than the pre-defined performance criterion of 17% based 
on natural history data (p<0.0001) (NeuroNEXT SMA Infant Biomarker Study (Kolb et al., 2017)).  
Assessment report

Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination Module 2 (HINE-2), Motor Milestone 
Responders: The proportion of milestone responders as assessed by the HINE-2 at 12 months (32/41 
patients, 78.0%; 90% CI: 64.8%, 88.0%) was significantly higher than the pre-defined performance 
criterion of 12% based on natural history data (p<0.0001) (De Sanctis et al, 2016).  
Survival and Ventilation-Free Survival:  At 12 months 3/41 (7%) patients died and a further 3/41 
patients met the endpoint of permanent ventilation. Thus, at 12 months, 35/41 patients [85.4% 
(35/41; 90% CI: 73.4%, 92.2%)] were alive without permanent ventilation, a proportion significantly 
higher than the pre-defined performance criterion of 42% based on natural history data (NeuroNEXT 
SMA Infant Biomarker Study, p<0.0001). The median time to death or permanent ventilation was not 
estimable as few patients had an event. At 12 months 38/41 (92.7%, 90% CI: 82.2%, 97.1%) 
patients were alive, a proportion significantly higher in comparison to the performance criteria of 60% 
(NeuroNEXT SMA Infant Biomarker Study, p=0.0005). Conversely, the proportion of infants without 
permanent ventilation at Month 12 was 92.7% (90% CI: 81.2%, 97.0%) and was not significantly 
different from the pre-defined performance criterion of 89% based on natural history data (p=0.2595). 
With regards to survival, as of 1 December 2020, the applicant confirms there have been no further 
deaths or study discontinuations in Part 2 of this study since the Month 12 analysis (CCOD: 14 
November 2019), which represents at least 24 months of data. 
Subgroup analysis: As regards to the subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by sex, only 1/19 
males (5.3%, 90% CI: 0.27-22.64) achieved the primary endpoint, compared to 11/22 females (50%, 
90% CI: 31.13-68.87).  It is acknowledged that, given the small numbers of patients in each 
subgroup, the results should be interpreted with caution; nevertheless, subgroup analysis of the 
primary endpoint by sex in Part 1 of Study FIREFISH have been requested, in order to assess whether 
a similar trend was observed and a discussion on possible reasons for the observed differences on the 
primary endpoint by sex has been requested. Despite the comprehensive analysis of baseline 
characteristics, PK/PD and efficacy endpoints, the applicant did not find an explanation for the 
observed differences related to gender in the Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) Part 2 primary endpoint 
results.  The totality of the Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) survival data (Part 1 and Part 2) suggests that 
there is no gender difference in survival. Taking into consideration the trial’s limited sample size in the 
context of a rare disease and the fact that the study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy among 
subgroups, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the potential effect of gender on the obtained results. 
FIREFISH Part1:  After at least 12 months of risdiplam treatment in Part 1 of the study 7/21 patients 
(33.3%), all in cohort 2, achieved sitting without support for 5 seconds or more, as assessed by Item 
22 of the BSID-III gross motor scale. As of the CCOD, 3 patients (14.3%) in Part 1 had died and the 
remaining 18/21 patients (85.7%) were alive without permanent ventilation. Of the 3 deaths, two 
occurred before Month 12 and one after (on Days 21, 236, and 387, respectively). The results 
observed in Part 1 of the study would meet the threshold of achievement that was pre-defined for 
these endpoints in Part 2. 
The results from FIREFISH Part 1 at 24 months showed that enrolled patients continued to improve 
with prolonged risdiplam therapy. Patients achieved additional motor milestones from Month 12 to 
Month 24 [proportion of patients sitting without support for 5 seconds or more (Item 22 BSID-III): 
33%v s 52%; sitting without support for 30 seconds (Item 26 BSID-III): 19% vs 24%; Sitting HINE 2 
(stable sit or pivots): 28.6% vs 42.9%], and a high proportion of patients remained event free (alive 
without permanent ventilation at Month 24). The presented data differ from natural history studies. 
     To allow contextualisation, the applicant has been requested to compare results of risdiplam 
development plan in infantile symptomatic SMA to those with nusinersen and onasemnogene 
abeparvovec, the approved medication that covers similar indication. The applicant responds that the 
population in STRIVE (onasemnogene abeparvovec) and FIREFISH studies were so different due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 188/293 
 
 
inclusion / exclusion criteria that no comparison can be performed. One of them was the maximal age 
at the time of starting treatment. Another was the fact that for STRIVE, presymptomatic patients were 
also allowed. Median age at treatment for STRIVE was 3.5 months as compared to 5.3 for FIREFISH 
Part 2. On average, STRIVE pts had higher basal performance 32.0 mean CHOP-INTEND score than the 
FIREFISH (mean of 21.7). These differences are considered significant. Since the MAA does not have 
individual data for STRIVE, a patient-to-patient comparison cannot be performed. Moreover, STRIVE 
excluded patients with AAV antibodies and with recent infections, so part of the differences would be 
expected. Also, given the fact that onasemnogene abeparvovec is a single administration only product, 
which attains (and hopefully sustains) the attained response after a restricted interval in time while 
risdiplam is a chronic use product, the nusinersen / risdiplam comparison is the most relevant. 
Comparison of nusinersen to risdiplam: the severity of disease at baseline was slightly worse in Study 
BP39056 (FIREFISH) for both part patient populations, as shown in the differences in baseline CHOP-
INTEND and HINE-2 scores, which is in line with the inclusion criteria for FIREFISH of disease 
diagnosed until 3 mths of age as compared to ENDEAR 6 mths. ENDEAR study was assessed at the 
interim analysis, and the survival outcome may have been underestimated if some of the pts were 
under ventilation and later recovered and the motor milestones might have been higher and more 
frequently reached if the pts had been followed for a sufficient period. This may explain the better 
nominal results of FIREFISH as compared to ENDEAR in the endpoints that were similarly assessed in 
both studies: % of HINE 2 responders is roughly 1.3 to 1.5x higher with risdiplam (FIREFISH Part 1 
and 2) than with nusinersen, and the % of infants alive is 1.5 to 1.6x higher with risdiplam than with 
nusinersen. Event free survival and time to death or permanent ventilation also follow a similar 
pattern. 
Later onset SMA: Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) is a two-part, multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-
blind study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and efficacy of risdiplam in patients with Type 
2 and 3 SMA (aged 2 to 25 years). The study consists of a dose finding Part 1 and a confirmatory Part 
2 at the dose selected based on the data obtained in Part 1. In Part 1 of the study, a total of 51 
patients were enrolled. Patients who were assigned to placebo were switched to active treatment at 
the dose tested in their respective cohort after a minimum 12-week placebo-controlled treatment 
period. After selection of the dose for Part 2 (referred to as the pivotal dose), all patients in Part 1 
received the pivotal dose as part of an open-label treatment phase. Part 1 patients did not enrol in Part 
2 of the study. The open-label treatment phases of Part 1 and Part 2 remain ongoing. 
SUNFISH Trial Part 2:   
The pivotal trial for later onset SMA, is Part 2 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH), a double-blind, 
randomised, placebo controlled study, that -according to inclusion criteria- enrolled 2-25 years of age 
patients with clinical symptoms attributable to Type 2 or Type 3 SMA non-ambulant (i.e. not having 
the ability to walk unassisted for 10 m or more) and genetic confirmation of homozygous deletion or 
heterozygosity predictive of loss of function of the SMN1 gene. A 2:1 (risdiplam: placebo) 
randomisation ratio was applied in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) to help support recruitment and 
retention, in light of the availability of nusinersen. 
The Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM 32) was agreed as a primary endpoint at the time of CHMP 
Scientific Advice (SA). The items assessed in the MFM32 capture a broad range of motor abilities, 
including items relating to distal fine motor movements of the hands and gross motor function 
activities such as standing. However, in light of the fact that MFM 20 is usually used before 5 years of 
age and MFM 32 was initially validated in children aged > 6, further discussion was requested on to 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 189/293 
 
 
whether the results observed in the 2-5 years age subgroup (showing a larger effect in comparison to 
older ages) might have been influenced by any development-related improvement. A further analysis 
was requested in the 2-5 years age group, excluding from the scoring algorithm the 12 additional 
items which are not included in the MFM20 (this is the approach used by the applicant to compare the 
results of the Part1 SUNFISH Study with an external control group, where MFM 20 was used for 
patients <6 years of age). The applicant’s argumentation that -given that  Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
Part 2 was a placebo-controlled study- although the MFM32 results in the youngest age group (2-<6 
years) may have been influenced by functional gains driven by general development of these children, 
the placebo arm enrolled in Part 2 of the study allows for a comparison with the treated group and 
evaluation of this potential effect, is acknowledged. The results show an improvement both in the 
risdiplam treated group [mean change from baseline of 5.34 (95% CI: 3.97, 6.71)] and in the PBO 
group [mean change from baseline  of 2.20 (95% CI: 0.33, 4.08)], and an overall estimate of the 
difference of risdiplam from placebo of 3.14 (95% CI: 0.81, 5.46) demonstrating the benefit of 
risdiplam in this age group. Given that the overall findings of risdiplam studies appear to support the 
early initiation of treatment with risdiplam, the request to perform a sensitivity analysis of the primary 
endpoint excluding children under the age of 6, to understand how this would impact results was not 
further pursued. 
Among secondary endpoints, there were: Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), a validated SMA-specific 
outcome measure that assesses upper limb functional abilities, and the Hammersmith Functional Motor 
Scale Expanded (HFMSE) that, similarly to the chosen primary endpoint, assesses motor function and 
for which there is significant longitudinal experience in patients with SMA. 
Population enrolled: Most of the patients enrolled had Type 2 SMA (71%, 128/180) and most 
patients had 3 copies of the SMN2 gene (>80%). Median patient age at screening was 9.0 years in 
both groups, with 37.8% (68 patients) 12 years or older at screening. Only 22 patients were in the age 
category 18-25 years (risdiplam: n=14; placebo: n= 8). The median age of onset of initial SMA 
symptoms, as reported by the parents or patients, was 12.4 months (range 0-135 months). One 
hundred and twenty patients (66.7%) had scoliosis at screening (risdiplam: 63%, placebo: 73%). 3 
patients (2.5%) in the risdiplam group required BiPAP support >16 hours/ day, compared to no 
patients in PBO. Randomisation in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) was stratified by age group only (2-5, 6-
11, 12-17, or 18-25 years at randomisation).  
The median motor function scores for the different scales at baseline were comparable across the 
risdiplam and placebo arms. The range (min-max) of total scores at baseline for MFM32, RULM, and 
HFMSE was broad (i.e. MFM32: 17-72 points; RULM: 3-38 points; HFMSE: 0-48 points), reflecting the 
heterogeneity of the enrolled population. The proportion of patients with a HFMSE score below 10 at 
baseline was high: 41.1% across the study population, with a similar proportion in each treatment arm 
(RIS: 40.8%; PLB: 41.7%).  
The primary analysis was conducted once the last patient in Part 2 completed 12 months of treatment 
(CCOD: 6 September 2019). Only four patients discontinued the study during the placebo-controlled 
period, in order to switch to other treatment [3 patients (2.5%) in the risdiplam arm, and 1 patient 
(1.7%) in the placebo arm]. 
Patients who received placebo during the double-blind period of the study were then switched in a 
blinded manner to the study sites to treatment with risdiplam when they completed 12 months of 
treatment and continued on risdiplam until Month 24. Considering the slow progression of Type 2 and 
Type 3 SMA, 12 months is a relatively short study duration.  
In SUNFISH Part 2, risdiplam was administered orally at 5 mg once daily for patients with body weight 
≥20 kg and 0.25 mg/kg once daily for patients with body weight <20 kg, that correspond to 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 190/293 
 
 
recommended dosing regimen in the proposed SmPC in patients ≥ 2 months of age. 
The patient population enrolled in FIREFISH and SUNFISH trial is not representative of the broad 
indication sought by the applicant. Available data do not allow a benefit/ risk assessment in severely 
affected (both infantile and later onset) SMA patients, in ambulant type 3 and in all type 4 patients. 
The applicant was requested to discuss the need to restrict the indication to the patient population 
enrolled in risdiplam pivotal trials, in light of the overall available results. Early onset SMA patients 
were not under mechanical ventilation at BL. While some had tracheostomy and invasive ventilation, 
these did not reach primary endpoint, in spite of reaching improvement in CHOP INTEND. For 
presymptomatic children RAINBOWFISH trial is ongoing and efficacy data is not available at the 
moment; notwithstanding, data on safety warns about possible hepatic risk of risdiplam in this very 
young population. Therefore, the applicant proposal that the indication will be limited to symptomatic 
patients above 2 mths of age is agreed. Regarding late onset SMA, no data has been obtained in type 
4 patients, and extrapolation from type 3 is hampered by the limitation of main trial to non ambulant 
patients. Also, risdiplam has not been studied in any patient with 5 or more SMN copies, which 
precludes information on the magnitude of effect of risdiplam in these patients.  
Among SUNFISH Part 2 exclusion criteria, there was concomitant or previous administration of a 
SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide, SMN2 splicing modifier or gene therapy either in a clinical 
study or as part of medical care. The discussion on the need to include or exclude from the indication 
patients that previously received treatment with Zolgensma or Spinraza, also in light of updated data 
from the JEWELFISH study provided only limited data. Unfortunately, no specific data was provided 
regarding efficacy of risdiplam after treatment with nusinersen. While in terms of safety there does not 
seem to exist any special issue, data supporting the use of risdiplam after previous treatment with 
nusinersen is not available, in spite of the number of treated patients. As for Zolgensma, safety data 
does not raise new concerns over the known safety profile of naïve SMA patients. However, only 14 
patients previously received Zolgensma (5 treated with risdiplam for ≤6 months, 9 receiving risdiplam 
between 6 and 12 months). These data appear insufficient to allow an adequate assessment of 
possible safety risks of risdiplam treatment, following previous treatment with Zolgensma. Moreover, 
no specific recommendations      can be made upon the interval between Zolgensma administration or 
nusinersen stop and risdiplam initiation. 
The actual number of patients randomised to and enrolled in Part 2 (n=180) was higher than the 
target sample size (n=168) and the applicant has been requested to discuss on the impact that this 
may have had on the statistical significance of the study results. Screening/enrolment into the study 
was competitive and managed via a study portal. The study portal was used to allow the Sponsor to 
have control and oversight of the enrolment process. There was overenrolment at the end of study 
inclusion. Ten of the last 12 enrolled pts were from the 3 Canadian sites. Screen failure always 
remained      stable (14-16%). A sensitivity analysis was provided using a mixed model repeated 
measures analysis on the primary endpoint of the change from baseline in MFM32 total score at Month 
12 of Part 2 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) including only the first 168 enrolled patients.       The 
corresponding values in the primary analysis including all the 180 patients enrolled were the following: 
the least square means (lsmeans) (SE) change from baseline in MFM32 total score at Month 12 was 
1.36 (0.38) in patients receiving risdiplam and -0.19 (0.52) in patients receiving placebo. Least square 
difference in mean [95% CI] change from baseline in MFM32 at Month 12: 1.55 [0.30, 2.81]; 
p=0.0156). Thus the sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint including only the first 168 enrolled 
patients determined a decrease in the difference from PBO and in the level of statistical significance, 
although difference from PBO remained statistically significant. 
The FDA statistical review indicated that the positive SUNFISH study results were dependent on the 
data from the sites in Poland. The applicant was requested to discuss possible reasons for the observed 
Assessment report

Page 191/293 
 
 
greater magnitude of effect in sites from Poland. It is worth to mention that Poland was the country 
that enrolled the highest number of patients (n=32/180, 17.8%). 
As requested, the applicant provided analysis of the primary endpoint, the change from baseline in the 
Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM32) total score at Month 12 of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2 by 
country and the analysis of the secondary endpoints, the proportion of patients with a change from 
baseline in the MFM32 ≥3 and the change from baseline in the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) at 
Month 12 by country. For MFM32 total score, the greatest improvement from baseline with risdiplam 
compared with placebo was observed in Italy (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 7.06 [2.37, 
11.76]) followed by Poland (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 5.75 [2.78, 8.71]). Although the 
magnitude of improvement is greater in both these countries compared with the overall population 
(mean treatment difference [95% CI]: 1.55 [0.30, 2.81]), the results in all countries have overlapping 
95% confidence intervals. It is true that Poland is among the countries with a stronger treatment 
effect, but it is not an isolated outlier and there is variation across countries. The results from Poland 
are within the range of what we see across all countries and are consistent with the assumption that 
this is a chance finding. For ≥3 points in MFM32, the greatest improvement from baseline with 
risdiplam compared with placebo was observed in Italy followed by Canada, Serbia, United States then 
Poland. The results in Poland (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.98 [0.84, 10.55]) are consistent with the overall 
population (odds ratio [95% CI: 2.35 [1.01, 5.44].  
SUNFISH Trial Part 1:  
Exploratory  efficacy  analyses  were  also  conducted  in  the  dose-finding  Part  1  of  the  SUNFISH  study. 
Patients  in  Part  1  did  not roll over  into  Part  2 of  the  study.  51  type 2  (73%)  and  type  3  (27%)  SMA 
patients,  mostly non-ambulatory  (86.3%),  with  a median  age  at  screening of  7.0  years  (range:  2-24 
years)  were  enrolled  in  Part  1  of  the  SUNFISH  trial.  After  the  first  12  weeks  of  placebo-  controlled 
treatment, all patients received the pivotal dose. In the absence of a placebo control arm, the applicant 
conducted a retrospective analysis in order to compare patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA from Part 1 of 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) who received risdiplam for at least 24 months with patients from two external 
control  sources,  the  NatHis-SMA  Study  (a  longitudinal  natural  history  study)  and  the  placebo  arm  of 
Study WN29836 (a phase 2 Study with Olesoxime). 
For  the  retrospective  comparison  -given  that  the  MFM  scale  was  not  assessed  in  the  same  way  in 
SUNFISH Study and in the external control sources- the MFM total score was derived based on the MFM32 
total score for patients aged ≥6 years and the MFM20 total score for patients age <6 years. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
SUNFISH Trial Part 2 
Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint showed a statistically significant difference from PBO in the 
change from baseline in MFM-32 total score: difference from PBO estimate 1.55 (95%CI: 0.30, 2.81), 
p=0.0156. Change from baseline in MFM32 total score showed an improvement in the risdiplam group 
[change from baseline, LS means: 1.36 (95% CI: 0.61-2.11)], compared to a worsening observed in 
the PBO group [-0.19 (95% CI:-1.22, 0.84)].  
Even though the difference was statistically significant, the absolute difference from PBO is relatively 
modest (1.6-point difference on a 100-point scale) and the magnitude of effect observed was lower 
than expected in the assumptions for sample size calculations (minimum detectable treatment 
difference: approximately 2.03; true treatment difference 3).  
Only very limited data are available for the primary endpoint, beyond 12 months (n=8 patients, 
observed at week 78, all in the risdiplam group).  Differently from what observed at 12 months, at 18 
months (week 78) the mean change from baseline shows a worsening trend (mean change from 
baseline: -0.65 (95% CI -2.98, 1.67). Ideally, results of the primary endpoint at 24 months are thus 
needed. From available data, in patients initially randomised to risdiplam, the favourable effects

observed in motor function through mean change from baseline in MFM32 and RULM scores after 12 
months were maintained after 24 months. As regards to change from baseline in the HFMSE total score 
(secondary endpoint with no statistically significant difference from PBO at 12 months), in patients 
treated with risdiplam for 24 months, a numerical improvement was observed by Month 24.  
The pre-specified responder analysis of MFM32 (proportion of patients with a change from baseline in 
MFM32 total score ≥3 at Month 12: 38.3% risdiplam vs 23.7% PBO) lends support to the clinical 
relevance of the observed effect, even though the results appear to be on the verge of statistical 
significance (with a p-value of 0.0469, rounded 0.05). The proportion of patients who achieved 
stabilisation or improvement (i.e., a change from baseline ≥0) on the total MFM score at Month 12 
(endpoint not included in the hierarchy, thus without adjustment for multiplicity) was 69.6% in 
patients receiving risdiplam and 54.2% in those receiving placebo at Month 12 (odds ratio [95% CI]: 
2.00 [1.02, 3.93]; p=0.0430). The proportion of MFM-32 responders (i.e. patients  with Change from 
Baseline in MFM32 Total Scores ≥3 (32.2% vs 38.3%) and the proportion of patients who achieved 
stabilisation or improvement (i.e., a change from baseline ≥0 on the total MFM32 score (58.3% vs 
69.6%) decreased at 24 months  in comparison to what observed at 12 months.  
Results on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) outcome at 24 months, as well as 
proportion of responders at 24 months for the endpoints RULM and HFMSE and subgroup analysis have 
not been included in the Summary Report provided. 
In SUNFISH trial Part 2, the results on the subgroup analysis by age of the primary endpoint (Change 
from Baseline in MFM32 Total Score at Month 12), showed absence of effect in the subgroup 19-25 
years of age. The applicant highlights several aspects to justify: a) baseline characteristics of adult 
patients: among the 22 adult non-ambulant patients (aged 18 to 25 years) randomised to receive 
risdiplam (14 patients) or placebo (8 patients), the median age of onset of initial symptoms was 17.6 
months and they had an extensive duration of disease, up to 23 years, by the time of receiving the 
first dose of study treatment (risdiplam or placebo). There were 12 (54.5%) Type 2 SMA patients and 
10 (45.5%) Type 3 patients in the adult group, with more Type 2 patients within the risdiplam group 
(57.1%). As expected, with increased age there was an accumulation of SMA-related disabilities: all 
but one of the adult patients had scoliosis and 35.7% of the patients who received risdiplam and 50% 
of the patients who received placebo had severe scoliosis (Cobb angle >40°). 71.4% and 50.0% of 
risdiplam and placebo patients, respectively had undergone surgery for scoliosis. At baseline, the 
median MFM32 (39 vs 46), RULM (17 vs 19) and HFMSE scores (5 vs 10) were lower in the risdiplam 
arm compared to placebo, indicating weaker motor function ability. b) the lack of power for subgroup 
analyses. And c) descriptive efficacy results in the adult subgroup: a numerically higher proportion of 
patients showed stabilisation in MFM32 score from baseline (change from baseline MFM32 total score 
≥0) and stabilisation or improvement in RULM score from baseline (change from baseline RULM ≥0 or 
≥2) among the small subgroup of adult patients treated with risdiplam in comparison with the small 
subgroup of adult patients assigned to placebo. 
The applicant has been requested to clarify how MFM32 domain 1 (standing position and transfer) has 
been included for non-ambulant patients in SUNFISH Part 2. It was justified in two fold: first, an 
ambulant patient was erroneously included to the study due to misunderstanding of the criteria by a 
study site; second, the standing and transfer domain 1 assesses several levels of difficulty, and 
progression could be observed in some patients which might have attained some motor skills in spite 
of being non ambulant. Notwithstanding, most pts scored zero at this domain at BL, and improved 
scores afterwards. This also confirmed that MFM32 is a tool able to detect treatment response. 
The applicant has been requested to provide a post hoc sensitivity analysis and comment to what 
degree presence of relevant genetic factors besides number of SMN copies are expected to affect 
observed results. No specific genetic testing for possible splicing-affecting mutations or single-
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 193/293 
 
 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed. Only the number of SMN2 copies was studied. This 
is unfortunate, as it further highlights the lack of sufficient data to allow adequate extrapolation of 
response to risdiplam in SMA type 4 patients. Moreover, as the applicant states, the published 
evidence on specific polymorphisms such as .859G>C and the A-44G in intron 6 in the SMN2 gene 
shows that these are rare in EU population, and might only affect up to 10% of SMA type 3 pts. 
Therefore other non studied features are likely to impact prognosis, particularly in LO-SMA. 
Secondary endpoints:  
Several concerns were raised regarding maintenance of effect and magnitude of response between 
M12 and 24 according to disease severity (HFMSE total score ≥ 10 or < 10 at baseline). The applicant 
provided the requested subgroup analyses for MFM-32 endpoints (mean change from baseline and 
responders analysis) at 12 months and at 24 months. 
Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM): A statistically significant difference from PBO was observed in 
mean change from baseline at Month 12 in the RULM total score, with a directionally consistent decline 
in the RULM observed in the placebo arm from Week 17 to Month 12, and an improvement observed in 
the risdiplam group. Patients with a less severe disease (HFMSE ≥10) at baseline achieved greater 
improvements in the RULM total scores with risdiplam treatment after 12 months (mean change from 
baseline: 2.81[95% CI 1.94, 3.68]) and 24 months of treatment (mean change from baseline: 3.63 
[95% CI 2.56, 4.69]), compared with the subgroup of patients with HFMSE <10 (at 12 months: 0.64 
[-0.55, 1.84]; at 24 months: 1.49 [0.14, 2.84]). Further responders’ analyses have been requested in 
order to better evaluate the clinical relevance of the observed effect on RULM. The % of patients 
receiving risdiplam with a change from Baseline of ≥3 (37.8 vs 17.2%) and ≥4 (26.9 vs 10.3%) in 
RULM total score at 12 months was greater in those receiving risdiplam than those on PBO. 
Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE): The difference from PBO in changes 
from baseline at 12 months in HFMSE (either assessed as mean change in total score or proportions of 
responders) was not significantly different between patients receiving risdiplam and patients receiving 
PBO. In the applicants view the small changes observed on this endpoint are likely a consequence of 
the low motor function scores at baseline [41.1% of patients had a HFMSE score below 10 at baseline 
(RIS: 40.8%; PLB: 41.7%)], making it more difficult for patients to show changes on the HFMSE. 
However, the subgroup analyses according to disease severity defined as HFMSE total score ≥ 10 or < 
10 at baseline, did not show differences in the effect of risdiplam at 12 months between patients with a 
less severe disease (HFMSE ≥10) (mean change from baseline: 1.16 [95% CI 0.23, 2.10]) and 
patients with HFMSE <10 (mean change from baseline: 1.24 [95% CI 0.17, 2.31]). After 24 months of 
treatment, a greater improvement in the HFMSE total score was observed in those with less severe 
disease at baseline (HFMSE ≥10), even though with overlapping confidence intervals (mean change 
from baseline: 2.45 [95% CI 0.94,3.96]) compared with the subgroup of patients with HFMSE <10 
(mean change from baseline: 1.69 [0.49, 2.89]). 
RULM and HFMSE responder analysis at 24 months (defined as % of patients with change from 
baseline ≥ 0 and ≥2) showed that the results observed at 12 months were maintained at 24 months. 
A subgroup analysis was performed to assess the efficacy by mth 24.

MFM32=Motor Function Measure 32. RULM=Revised Upper Limb Module. HFMSE=Hammersmith 
Functional Motor Scale Expanded. SMAIS=SMA Independence Scale. Baseline is the last measurement 
prior to the patient’s first dose of risdiplam. n=Valid results after applying the missing item rule. 
The total number of patients with a valid baseline (Day -1 or screening) total score in each 
corresponding scale were used as the denominator to calculate the percentages at each time point.  
Clinical cut-off date: 30Sep2020. 
In summary, there is evidence of a small effect on the upper limbs and overall muscle response and 
dexterity in the second year of treatment. In spite of the small number in the subgroup of patients with 
4 SMN2 copies (N=10), limiting the interpretability of the results, the magnitude of effect is similar, in 
the subgroup with 3 and 4 SMN2 copy number.  
As regards to disease severity, both at Month 12 and at month 24, the proportion of patients achieving 
improvement (change from baseline total score ≥2) in the RULM and HFMSE, was greater in those with 
less severe disease (HFMSE ≥10) at baseline in comparison to patients with more severe disease at 
baseline (HFMSE <10).  As regards to RULM a similar trend was observed also for proportion of 
patients achieving stabilisation (change ≥0); conversely, as regards to HFMSE, the proportion of 
patients achieving stabilisation (change ≥0) was similar between patients with baseline HFMSE ≥10 
and <10. 
FVC: Spirometry was performed to assess respiratory function in patients who were ≥6 years of age at 
screening. No relevant difference from PBO was observed in FVC at 12 months. 
SMA Independence Scale (SMAIS): Changes in caregiver-reported and patient-reported SMAIS 
total score (a new caregiver and PRO scale developed with the study) numerically favoured risdiplam 
compared to placebo, even though the differences were not statistically significant. 
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C): The difference between risdiplam (47.5%) and PBO 
(40%) group in the proportion of patients assessed as improved by the clinician (either minimally/ 
much or very much improved) at Month 12 was not statistically significant. The applicant argues that 
Assessment report

for the patient population enrolled in SUNFISH Study Part 2, that includes older patients with 
progressed disease, functional stabilisation (≥0 change from baseline in MFM-32) is an important 
treatment benefit. However, in Part 2 of the SUNFISH trial, according to clinician’s impression of a 
patient’s change in global health from baseline (CGI-C), a similar proportion of patients global health 
either improved or did not change from baseline (assessed as either “minimally improved”, “much 
improved”, “very much improved” or “no change” by the clinician) in the risdiplam arm (85.8%) 
compared to the placebo arm (83.3%) at Month 12 (difference from PBO: 1.21 (95% CI: 0.52, 2.83; 
p=0.6636). The applicant considers that the reason why the CGI-C failed to adequately discriminate 
patients in terms of their level of improvement may be due to the one-year recall period, lack of 
sensitivity to change in the outcome measure, and the broad nature of this item and the response 
options focused on global health. 
The applicant emphasises that the results from a caregiver-reported measure, the SMA Independence 
Scale (SMAIS)- a new tool which has been validated along the development plan- used approximately 
every 3 months in the study and with a seven-day recall period, demonstrated numerical 
improvements with risdiplam compared to placebo at Month 12. Numerical improvements were also 
observed in the patient-reported SMAIS (ages 12-25 years) with risdiplam compared to placebo at 
Month 12.

SUNFISH Part 1:  comparison with external sources: The results of the weighted analyses 
showed a statistically significant difference between patients treated with risdiplam, showing an 
improvement in motor function (assessed through LS mean change from baseline in total MFM) and 
the untreated weighted external control group, where a decline in motor function was observed. The 
weighting approach used gave more weight to a patient in the external control group who had a more 
similar covariate profile to a patient in SUNFISH study. A statistically significant higher proportion of 
responders (defined as change from baseline in MFM total score of ≥3) was observed among risdiplam 
treated patients in comparison with untreated external controls (54.2% vs 16.8% at 24 months). 
These differences were observed at Month 12 and maintained at Month 24.  
The applicant has been requested to discuss available data regarding pre-symptomatic patients, and 
discuss the benefit/risk in this population. Few SMA1 presymptomatic pts have been enrolled up to 
now in the Phase 2 RAINBOWFISH Study (expected to enrol 25 pts overall, 9 pts presented for IDMC 
available) and there is no hint on the possible effective dose for this very young population (pts 
enrolled aged 42 days or below). Moreover, two episodes of increased liver enzymes raise the concern 
of possible population sensitiveness to risdiplam, or a higher than expected administered dose. 
Therefore it is agreed that this population should be excluded from the indication. 
PAES proposal assessment 
The applicant has focused the PAES on a prospective, observational study of circa 300 patients with 
both symptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients. Data will be collected from possible multiple sources, 
from existing SMA registries plus a study specific registry. Data gathering will cover a minimum of 5 
years. EU countries will be the primary source for data. 
Study objectives 
The proposed study objectives (outcomes in treated pre-symptomatic stage pts, pts with 4 SMN2 
copies and long-term maintenance of efficacy and safety in SMA pts) are acceptable. These outcomes, 
however, should be compared to similar condition patients who have not been treated with risdiplam 
(natural history patients). The population (including both risdiplam treated and non-treated patients) 
should ideally come from the same registries, to decrease the risk of biases resulting from different 
study populations and different epochs. This aspect is especially relevant for the assessment of B/R in 
patients with 4 SMN2 copies: longitudinal data for both treated and non-treated patients must be 
available at the end of the study in this population.  
Study design and data sources 
A hybrid approach is proposed: data to be obtained from existing registries (including, but not limited 
to:  TREAT-NMD,  iSMAc,  SMArtCARE)  and  a  supplementary  study  specific  registry  to  accommodate 
targeted  data  and  deliver  results  within  the  expected  timeframe.  The  applicant  considers  conducting 
preparation feasibility study to build the definitive PAES study. 
Proposed population and sample size 
300 treated patients will be enrolled. A comparable number of non treated patients, with comparable 
status at study entrance, follow up and data on SMN2 copies number should also be available from the 
same registries. Final numbers will derive from final outcome measures, statistical plan and time-to-
population-availability of risdiplam within individual countries. 
Outcome measures 
Final outcomes target maintenance or improvement of motor milestones, ventilation and overall 
survival of patients. In all pts will be collected: Survival and ventilation free survival + WHO motor 
milestones. In pts up to two years, CHOP-INTEND will be obtained; in patients two years and above, 
HFMSE and RULM and MFM32 (where available) will be obtained. For highly functioning patients, timed 
endpoints will be collected. Overall the proposed strategy is acceptable. A balance is needed between 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 201/293 
 
 
the number of tools to be used and the practicality of data acquisition, both from each registry base 
and the individual patient (taken fatigue into consideration). For the sake of benefit risk assessment on 
the long term, the use of the tools that have been used during the development plan is favoured. As 
such, consideration should be given to inclusion of HINE-2. 
Statistical analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be used.  
Subgroup analyses will be made regarding SMN2 number of copies, symptomatic vs pre-symptomatic, 
and treated vs “natural history” non treated patients. 
An initial interim analysis is planned the moment that all expected pts have been enrolled. Further interim 
analyses will have a yearly basis.  
Status  reports  are  expected  annually,  independently  from  the  planned  interim  analysis.  These  status 
reports will allow assessment of ongoing recruitment and follow-up attrition, to confirm feasibility within 
the proposed timeframe, and to implement recover strategies if needed.  
Study duration and expected milestones 
The applicant proposes to conduct a study with 2-3 years enrolment period + 5 years of follow-up. The 
study is to be started upon agreement of the final plan once the feasibility is conducted (first 6 mths 
prior to PAES study start), and final results and plan are presented to CHMP. The estimated submission 
for the final study is thus in 2030. This date should mark the limit date for submission. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The patient population enrolled in FIREFISH and SUNFISH trial is not representative of the broad 
indication initially sought by the applicant, as patients with a clinical diagnosis of Type 4 SMA or 
exhibiting 5 SMN2 copies or more have not been studied in the clinical development. Available data 
only allow a benefit/ risk assessment in children 2 months and above, and after the assessment of 
available data from all sources, efficacy has been considered sufficiently demonstrated for marketing 
authorisation in patients with up to 4 SMN2 copies or with clinical types of SMA 1, 2 and 3.  
Efficacy data of Evrysdi treatment when used in patients that previously received SMN1 gene therapy 
is not available. There is no efficacy or safety data to support the concomitant use of risdiplam and 
nusinersen. 
SMA type 1:  
After clarifications have been received on the clinical relevance of the primary endpoint chosen (sitting 
without support for 5 seconds) and on how the persistence of the milestone “sitting without support” 
has been assessed in FIREFISH trial, its relevance was accepted. 
Later onset SMA: Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 
Even though the difference from PBO on the primary endpoint (MFM-32) in SUNFISH trial Part 2 was 
statistically significant, the absolute difference from PBO was relatively modest (1.6-point difference on 
a 100-point scale) and no statistically significant difference from PBO was observed in the secondary 
endpoint HFMSE. Besides the known slower progression of Type 2 and Type 3 SMA, the modest effects 
observed may be due to the short study duration (12 months) and also to the heterogeneity of disease 
progression in later onset SMA (also in untreated subjects).  The results of primary and secondary 
endpoints at 24 months overall showed that the results observed at 12 months were generally 
maintained at 24 months. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
“Post-authorisation  Efficacy  Study  (PAES):  a  long-term  prospective,  observational  study  to  further 
evaluate disease progression in SMA patients (both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic) with 1 to 4 SMN2 
copies treated with risdiplam, in comparison to natural history data in untreated patients.”  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 202/293 
 
 
The proposed PAES will provide data on the knowledge gaps of:  
a) efficacy when risdiplam is started in pre-symptomatic patients;  
b) efficacy in patients with 4 SMN2 copies;  
c) maintenance of efficacy on the long term in all patients including the a) and b) populations.  
The presented plan is acceptable, provided that the main aspects as described in the study proposal are 
fulfilled. 
2.6. Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Risdiplam is a small molecule SMN2 (survival of motor neuron 2) splicing modifier presented with an 
oral formulation (powder for oral solution) and proposed for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA). Risdiplam promotes the inclusion of exon 7 to generate full-length SMN2 mRNA, leading to the 
increase in the production of functional SMN protein from the SMN2 gene, both in the central nervous 
system and systemically, throughout the body. A rapid (within 4 weeks) and durable increase of SMN 
protein blood levels has been shown. The recommended once daily dose is determined by age and 
body weight up to a maximum of 5 mg. Treatment with a daily dose above 5 mg has not been studied. 
The safety data set of risdiplam submitted in support of the present MAA is based on safety data 
available from the two ongoing pivotal clinical studies FIREFISH and SUNFISH as well as from the 
ongoing supportive study JEWELFISH. Where relevant, reference is made to safety data from 5 
completed studies in healthy volunteers and subjects with hepatic impairment and to placebo-
controlled safety data from the double-blind period of SUNFISH. 
Patient exposure 
In order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the safety profile of risdiplam in All SMA population 
N=465) and by SMA type (Type 1 versus Type 2 and 3), the available safety data were integrated and 
analysed for the following 3 pools: 
i)  All patients with SMA;  
ii) Patients with Type 1 SMA (infantile-onset);  
iii)Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA (later-onset).  
The following studies are integrated for pooling:   
●  Study BP39056 (FIREFISH): Part 1 and Part 2; n=62 patients with infantile-onset SMA (Type 1) 
(aged 1 to 7 months at enrolment). 
This is a two-part, multicentre, single arm, open-label study. Part 1: dose-finding, included 21 patients 
that did not enrol in the Part 2 but entered an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) phase to continue 
treatment at the dose selected for Part 2. Part 2: confirmatory at the dose selected in Part 1 (pivotal 
dose); pivotal, single-arm study; 41 symptomatic patients treated for 24 months followed by an OLE. 
The clinical cut-off date (CCOD) for the safety data was 14 November 2019 when all patients in Part 2 
had completed the 12-month assessment (primary analysis of efficacy) and all patients in Part 1 had 
been dose-escalated to the pivotal dose and completed the 12-month assessment. Updated data was 
CCOD 27 October 2020. 
• 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH): Part 1 and Part 2; n=231 patients with later-onset SMA (Type 2 
and 3) (aged 2 to 25 years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 203/293 
 
 
 
This is a two-part, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Part 1: dose-
finding, included 51 patients, those assigned to placebo were switched to active treatment at the dose 
tested in their respective cohort after a minimum 12-week placebo-controlled treatment period; After 
selection of the dose for Part 2 (pivotal dose), all patients in Part 1 received the pivotal dose as part of 
an open-label treatment phase. Part 1 patients did not enrol in Part 2 of the study. Part 2: 
confirmatory at the dose selected in Part 1; ongoing double-blind, 2:1 randomised, placebo-controlled 
study; 180 patients enrolled (risdiplam: n=120, placebo: n=60). Patients who received placebo during 
the double-blind period of the study were switched in a blinded manner to treatment with risdiplam 
when they completed 12 months of treatment.  
Overall, safety data up to the CCOD of 15 January 2020 from 230 out of 231 patients enrolled who 
received risdiplam are included in the pooled safety analyses. This CCOD includes safety data up to the 
primary analyses for Part 2 of the study (time point at which all ongoing patients had reached at least 
12-months of treatment with risdiplam or placebo), as well as safety data for Part 1 for the timepoint 
at which all ongoing patients had reached at least 24 months of treatment with risdiplam at the pivotal 
dose. Updated data was CCOD 30 September 2020.

3) and 15 patients with infantile-onset SMA (Type 1) 
This is an open-label, non-comparative study in SMA patients previously enrolled in Roche Study 
BP29420 (MOONFISH) with the splicing modifier RO6885247 (development discontinued) or previously 
treated with SPINRAZA (nusinersen), Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec, AVXS-101), or 
olesoxime (previous Roche-acquired development compound, which has since been discontinued) in 
which treatment with risdiplam is evaluated over a 24-month period. Study enrolment has been 
completed with 174 patients; these 174 patients had previously received either nusinersen (N=76), 
RO6885247 (N=13), olesoxime (N=71), or AVXS-101 (N=14). Safety data up to the CCOD of 31 
January 2020 from 173 out of 174 patients enrolled are included in the analyses presented in this SCS. 
One interim analysis with some safety data was updated during the MAA review (CCOD 31 July 2020). 
Safety data from Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH, CCOD 27 October 2020) was provided.  
No safety data are available from Study BP39859 (ANCHOVY) because this is a non-interventional 
natural history study, in which safety data was not collected. 
Non-integrated safety data from the following studies are also provided: 
• 
• 
Safety data from the 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled period from Study BP39055 
(SUNFISH) Part 2 (patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA) to show double-blind placebo comparison. 
5 studies in healthy volunteers and subjects with hepatic impairment (Studies BP39122, BP29840, 
NP39625, BP41361, BP40995). Of note, data from these studies were included in the assessments 
of abuse potential, and effects on ability to Drive and Use Machines.

Purpose of Pool 
The All Patients with SMA pool includes all of 
the available unblinded safety data up to the 
CCOD for each study.  The purpose of this pool 
is to assess the safety of risdiplam in patients 
with Type 1, 2, and 3 SMA. 
The Type 1 SMA pool includes all of the 
available safety data up to the CCODs for Study 
BP39056 (Part 1 and Part 2) and Study 
BP39054. The purpose of this pool is to assess 
the safety of risdiplam in patients with Type 1 
SMA. 
The Type 2 and Type 3 SMA pool includes all of 
the available safety data up to the CCODs for 
Study BP39055 (Part 1 and Part 2 of the study), 
and Study BP39054.  The purpose of this pool is 
to assess the safety of risdiplam in patients with 
Type 2 and 3 SMA. 
These data are included to provide double-blind 
placebo-controlled safety assessment and 
provide the basis for preliminary ADR 
identification in patients with Type 2 and 3 
SMA.  
These data are included to enable the most 
comprehensive safety profile assessment 
possible at this time. Data from these studies 
were included in the assessments of abuse 
liability, and effects on ability to drive and use 
machines, as well as the impact of mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment and the impact of 
risdiplam on the PK of midazolam.

All Patients with SMA 
In the All Patients with SMA population (n=465), the median duration of exposure to risdiplam was 
12.68 months (range: 0.0–38.9).  A total of 158 patients (34.0%) had been treated for up to 6 
months, 69 patients (14.8%) for more than 6 months up to 12 months, 85 patients each (18.3%) for 
between 12 months and 18 months and 18 to 24 months, and 68 patients (14.6%) for more than 24 
months. The overall exposure was 521.4 patient-years (PY).  The overall exposure to the pivotal dose 
was 480.9 PY, corresponding to approximately 92% of the overall exposure time (PY). 
All patients had received at least 78.5% of the total number of prescribed doses (dose intensity).  
Median dose intensity was 100%.   
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
In the Type 1 SMA population (n=77), the median duration of exposure was 15.24 months (range: 
0.1−34.6).  At the time of analysis, the majority of patients (55 patients, 71.4%) had been treated for 
>12 months. Exposure time was 33.6 PY in the 0−6 months treatment period, 28.9 PY in the 6−12 
months period, and 19.1 PY in the >12−≤18 month period, and declined further thereafter.  The overall 
exposure was 92.1 PY. 
Median exposure to the pivotal dose of 0.2 mg/kg for patients <2 years old and 0.25 mg/kg (<20 kg 
body weight) or 5 mg (≥20 kg body weight) for patients ≥2 years old was 13.98 months (range: 
0.1−23.6).  The total exposure to the pivotal dose was 77.9 PY, corresponding to approximately 85% 
of the overall exposure time (PY).  
Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA 
In the Type 2 and Type 3 SMA population (n=388), the median duration of treatment was 9.30 months 
(range: 0.0–38.9).  At the time of analysis most patients (246 patients, 63.4%) had been treated for 
>6 months. Overall exposure was 429.2 PY, with an exposure time of 164.2 PY in the 0−6 months 
treatment period, declining progressively to 100.6 in the 6−12 months period, 87.4 PY in the 12−18 
months treatment period, and 39.4 PY in the 18-24 months treatment period, with 37.6 PY exposure 
beyond 24 months. 
Median exposure to the pivotal dose of 0.25 mg/kg for patients with body weight <20 kg or 5 mg for 
patients with body weight ≥20 kg was 9.13 months (range: 0.0−34.5).  The total exposure to the 
pivotal dose was 403.0 PY, corresponding to approximately 94% of the overall exposure time.

The clinical cut-off date was January of 2020 for the SUNFISH and JEWLFISH studies. An update of 
safety data after both including and excluding JEWELFISH data, with the SUNFISH Part 2 placebo 
group included in the summary tables as a reference for the assessment; updated safety data of 
JEWELFISH was requested. Furthermore, available updated safety data, even if they are still limited, 
from the other ongoing studies RAINBOWFISH (Study BN40703 on pre-symptomatic infants from birth 
to 6 weeks who were genetically diagnosed with SMA), ANCHOVY (Study BP39859, a natural history 
study to assess medical record data retrospectively), and Pre-approval access (PAA)/Compassionate 
Use (CU) programme should also be provided as available.  
Demographic Characteristics 
There was a higher representation of patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA (n=388) versus Type 1 SMA 
(n=77) in this pooled population. 
The majority of patients with Type 1 SMA were less than 2 years of age at the time of the first dose of 
risdiplam (87.0%), whereas patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA were generally in the 2 to <12 years old 
group (46.9%) and older.  A total of 19.4% of patients were 18 years or older at the time of the first 
dose of risdiplam.  
The patients were predominantly White (73.8%), while 13.5% were of Asian race.  Overall, 77.2% of 
patients were enrolled at sites in European countries.  The proportion of Asian patients was higher in 
the Type 1 SMA pool (23.4%) compared to the Type 2 and 3 SMA pool (11.6%).  
Numerically, at baseline patients were lower than a healthy population in terms of height, weight and 
BMI based on WHO Child Growth Standards (World Health Organization, 2006), respectively.  Indeed, 
the patients’ mean (SD) weight, height, and BMI, were at the 35.11 (33.97), 39.18 (32.71), 37.16 
(38.46) percentile compared to WHO percentiles of healthy children and young adults.  However, there 
was broad inter-patient variability.  
Baseline Disease Characteristics  
Regarding type 1 SMA patients, a total of 65 patients had 2 SMN2 copies (genotyping), one patient had 
3 SMN2 copies, and the number of SMN2 copies was unknown (i.e., genotyping results were not 
available) for 11 patients. The median age at onset of initial SMA symptoms, as reported by the 
parents, was 1.5 months (range: 0.0−9.0) in line with a diagnosis of Type 1 SMA.  The median age at 
diagnosis was 3.0 months (range: 0.0−9.9). 
Seven patients were assessed as having scoliosis at screening.  The degree of curvature due to 
scoliosis was <40 in 3 patients (3.9%) and >40 in 3 patients (3.9%). For patients with Type 1 SMA, 
information about ambulatory status, scoliosis, hip surgery and fractures is only captured for patients 
enrolled in Study BP39054. 
Regarding type 2/3 SMA patients, the majority (70.1%) of patients had Type 2 SMA, and the most 
frequent SMN2 copy number (genotyping) was 3 SMN2 copies (68.0% of patients). The median age at 
onset of symptoms was 12.1 months (range: 0.0−258.0) and the majority of patients (93.8%) were 
non-ambulatory.  The median age at diagnosis was 18.0 months (range: 1.0-287.0).  
A total of 125 patients (32.2%) had severe scoliosis with a curvature of >40 degrees, and 131 patients 
(33.8%) had scoliosis surgery before screening.  Information about ambulatory status, scoliosis, hip 
surgery, and fractures is only captured for patients enrolled in Studies BP39054 and BP39055.

Adverse events 
Overview 
All patients with SMA 
A total of 465 patients received risdiplam and are included in the integrated safety analyses with an 
overall exposure time of 521.4 PY. Overall, 393 patients (84.5%) treated with risdiplam experienced at 
least one AE. The AE rate was 577.50 per 100 PY (95% CI: 557.06, 598.51).  The overall rate of AEs 
was comparable in patients with Type 1 SMA and patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA.  The majority of AEs 
were of Grade 1 or 2 intensity reported at rates of 418.31 per 100PY (95% CI: 400.94, 436.24) for 
Grade 1 and 124.48 per 100PY (95% CI: 115.08, 134.43) for Grade 2. Grade 3 events were reported 
at a rate of 26.47 per 100PY (95% CI: 22.24, 31.27).  Twenty-five Grade 4 events were reported 
(4.79 events per 100PY [95% CI: 3.10, 7.08]).  The rate of Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs was markedly 
higher in patients with Type 1 SMA, as compared to patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, approximately 
2.5-fold and 18.5-fold, respectively.  
Overall, seven patients with Type 1 SMA died due to SMA-related respiratory complications (reported 
as not related to study medication): 
Six patients died due to events with an onset date during the treatment period (1 patient experienced 
two Grade 5 AEs leading to death [cardiac arrest and respiratory failure]). 
A seventh patient died due to cardiac arrest 3.5 months after treatment discontinuation. 
Risdiplam treatment was permanently discontinued due to an AE (respiratory tract infection viral, 
Grade 5) in 1 patient with Type 1 SMA who discontinued risdiplam to receive palliative care 3 days 
prior to their death. 
A total of 65 patients (14.0%) had an AE that was reported as related to study treatment.  Treatment 
was interrupted for one patient with Type 2 or 3 SMA with an AE (diarrhoea) reported as related to 
study drug; the AE resolved and the patient continued treatment with risdiplam. The majority of 
related AEs resolved as of the CCOD.  The rate of related AEs was 19.18 per 100PY (95% CI: 15.61, 
23.33) and was comparable in patients with Type 1 and patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA.  
During treatment with risdiplam, 103 patients (22.2%) experienced at least one SAE. The overall rate 
of SAEs was 37.21 per 100PY (95% CI: 32.16, 42.83).  Of these, 1 patient with Type 1 SMA had an 
SAE of neutropenia that was reported as related to study treatment but resolved despite ongoing 
treatment with risdiplam, and another patient with Type 1 SMA had an SAE that led to withdrawal of 
study treatment (respiratory tract infection viral with fatal outcome).  The rate of SAEs was 
approximately 3.5-fold higher in patients with Type 1 SMA (93.33 per 100PY [95% CI: 74.66, 115.27]) 
compared to patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA (25.16 [95% CI: 20.64, 30.38]).  
One patient with Type 1 SMA who had discontinued risdiplam for non-safety related reasons 
experienced a total of 6 AEs that were reported during the safety follow-up period. 
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
A total of 77 patients with Type 1 SMA received risdiplam and are included in the integrated safety 
analyses with a total exposure time of 92.1 PY.  Seventy-two patients (93.5%) with Type 1 SMA 
treated with risdiplam experienced at least one AE.  The rate of AEs was 577.37 per 100PY (95% CI: 
529.34, 628.58).  The majority of AEs were of Grade 1 or 2 intensity, and Grade 3 5 AEs were 
experienced by 35 patients (45.5%).  Three patients (3.9%) had an AE that led to dose interruption for 
one day: pneumonia (1 patient), and hypoxia (1 patient), and 9 days pyrexia (1 patient), which were 
all reported as unrelated to study treatment and resolved without recurrence despite ongoing

treatment with risdiplam at the same dose.  One patient had an AE (respiratory tract infection viral, 
resulting in death) that led to withdrawal from treatment which was reported as unrelated to study 
treatment.  Nine patients (11.7%) had an AE that was reported as related to study treatment; 
however, none of these related AEs led to withdrawal or interruption of study treatment and had 
resolved or were resolving at the CCOD.  The rate of related AEs was 16.28 per 100PY (95% CI: 9.11, 
26.85). 
During treatment with risdiplam 42 patients (54.5%) with Type 1 SMA experienced at least one SAE at 
a rate of 93.33 per 100PY (95% CI: 74.66, 115.27).  Of these, 1 patient had an SAE (neutropenia) 
that was considered to be related to study treatment and resolved without change to study treatment, 
and 6 patients had a total of 7 fatal SAEs associated with SMA-related respiratory complications.  
Patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA 
A total of 388 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA received risdiplam and are included in the 
integrated safety analyses with total exposure time of 429.2 PY.  A total of 321 patients (82.7%) with 
Type 2 and 3 SMA treated with risdiplam experienced at least one AE. The AE rate was 577.53 per 
100PY (95% CI: 555.02, 600.72).  The majority of AEs were of Grade 1 or 2 intensity, and 53 patients 
(13.7%) experienced a Grade 3 or 4 AE.  Fifty-six patients (14.4%) had an AE that was reported as 
related to study treatment.  One AE that was assessed as related to treatment resulted in dose 
interruption (diarrhoea, Day 17); the patient also experienced abdominal pain and hyperchlorhydria, 
which were reported by the investigator as not related to risdiplam.  
Events reported as related to risdiplam resolved in most patients.  The unresolved events did not 
worsen in intensity despite ongoing treatment with risdiplam, with the exception of 3 AEs in 2 patients: 
livedo reticularis and cyanosis that went from Grade 1 intensity to Grade 2 intensity and an AE of 
weight increased that went from Grade 1 intensity to Grade 2 intensity.  A related AE that had not 
resolved at the time of the CCOD was reported in one patient with a Grade 1 event of INR increased; 
the action taken with study drug was listed as unknown.  The rate of related AEs was 19.80 per 100 PY 
(95% CI: 15.82, 24.49). 
Thirty patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA reported AEs that led to interruption of study treatment.  By 
CCOD, all events had resolved. Events had not recurred after reinitiating treatment with risdiplam in all 
of these patients with the exception of two patients who had not restarted risdiplam by the time of 
CCOD. 
During treatment with risdiplam, 61 patients (15.7%) with Type 2 and 3 SMA experienced at least one 
SAE at a rate of 25.16 per 100 PY (95% CI: 20.64, 30.38).  One SAE (supraventricular tachycardia) 
was reported as related to study treatment, and none led to withdrawal of treatment.  At the CCODs 
for this analysis, no deaths were reported among patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA. 
An overview of the safety profile of risdiplam in the All Patients with SMA population is shown in the 
next two tables.

The three SOCs with the highest rate of AEs by 100 PY were Infections and infestations; reported by 
305 patients (65.6%) at a rate of 178.37 AEs per 100PY, Gastrointestinal disorders (39.1%) at a rate 
of 88.99 per 100 PY, and Nervous system disorders (81 patients; 17.4%) at a rate of 67.13 per 100PY. 
In patients with Type 1 SMA, there was a trend towards higher rates of AEs compared with patients 
with Type 2 and 3 SMA in the SOCs Infections and infestations driven by events of upper respiratory 
tract infection, and General disorders and administration site conditions driven by events of pyrexia.  
In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, rates of AEs were higher in the SOCs Nervous system disorders, 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, and 
Reproductive system and breast disorders compared with patients with Type 1 SMA.  The marked 
differences in the SOCs Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and Nervous system disorders 
were driven by differences in events of pain in extremity (17 patients, 20 events), arthralgia (15 
patients, 21 events), back pain (14 patients, 29 events), and headache (64 patients, 291 events), 
which were reported mainly in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA and rely on self-reporting that is not

expected in patients with Type 1 SMA due to their young age.  No AEs were reported in the 
Reproductive system and breast disorders SOC in patients with Type 1 SMA who have mostly not 
reached sexual maturity.  
Other SOCs where AEs occurred frequently in Type 2 and 3 SMA pool were Gastrointestinal disorders 
(38.1% [n=148], 89.93 per 100PY) and Skin and subcutaneous disorders (21.4% [n=83], 30.98 per 
100PY). 
Differences, some of them smaller, between the two SMA pools were observed for other less frequently 
reported SOCs, such as Blood and lymphatic system disorders (Type 1 SMA 8.68 vs. Type 2 and 3 SMA 
3.96 per 100PY), Congenital familial and genetic disorders (4.34 vs. 0.93 per 100PY), Ear and 
Labyrinth disorders (1.09 vs. 5.36 per 100PY), Hepatobiliary disorders (2.17 vs. 0.70 per 100PY), 
Immune system disorders (1.09 vs. 2.56 per 100PY), Investigations (6.51 vs. 9.55 per 100PY), 
Metabolism and Nutrition disorders (9.77 vs. 6.29 per 100PY), Renal and urinary disorders (1.09 vs. 
5.82 per 100PY).   
A discussion in light to the extent of exposure, with AE rates decreasing over time, but no differences 
between the two population groups, on the differences in AE rates in Type 1 and Type 2/3 SMA 
populations in the four imbalanced SOCs was done. In nervous system disorders the greatest 
difference between the two SMA populations was in the magnitude of reported AEs of headache, all of 
them reported in the Type 2/3 SMA population. In musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders the 
greatest differences between the two SMA populations were seen in the AEs related to pain reports (in 
the extremity, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, neck pain, chest pain), more reported in Type 2/3 
population. In Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications the difference in AE rates was driven by 
the AEs of contusion, all of which were reported in the Type 2/3 population. In Reproductive System 
and Breast Disorders, all as reported in Type 2/3 population, the most frequent AE was dysmenorrhoea 
and metrorrhagia.  
In terms of SOCs, the results of FIREFISH (Study BP39056) and SUNFISH (Study BP39055) in terms of 
common AEs showed consistent results with the integrated safety analysis. Concerning the AEs by 
preferred terms, overall, in All patients with SMA, the AEs reported at the highest rates per 100 PY 
were headache (55.81 [95% CI: 49.58, 62.61]), pyrexia (43.15 [95% CI: 37.70, 49.18]), upper 
respiratory tract infection (41.62 [95% CI: 36.27, 47.54]), and nasopharyngitis (27.81 [95% CI: 
23.47, 32.72]).  Among AEs reported at rates ε10 per 100PY, there were higher rates of headache, 
nausea, and cough in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA compared with Type 1 SMA patients. A total of 
90 patients (19.4%) had an AE that had not resolved by the CCOD, 6 patients (1.3%) had a fatal AE, 
and 7 patients (1.5%) had an AE with an unknown outcome. The differences in AE rates between 
Type 1 SMA and Type 2 and 3 SMA populations appeared to be driven mainly by differences in age; the 
higher rate of pneumonia in patients with Type 1 SMA may be associated with higher disease severity. 
Adverse events reported with higher rates in patients with Type 1 SMA were pyrexia, upper respiratory 
tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, respiratory tract infection, rhinitis, and teething. Adverse 
events of teething were reported only in patients with Type 1 SMA.   
Other frequently reported AEs (rate <10 per 100PY) were cough (7.8%, 8.68 per 100PY) and 
gastroenteritis (3.9%, 5.43 per 100PY). Among the AEs with a frequency of 2 patients or more, there 
were urinary tract infection, ear infection, lower respiratory tract infection, viral infection (5.2% each), 
respiratory failure (6.5%, 5 patients), rash (6.5%), eczema (5.2%), erythema (3.9%), rash maculo-
papular (5.2%), dermatitis atopic (1.3%). Neutropenia occurred in 2 patients (2.6%). 
Overall, the results of FIREFISH (Study BP39056) (Part 1 and Part 2) in terms of common AEs showed 
consistent results with the integrated analysis. Of note, in Part 1 among the AEs occurring in ≥10% of 
patients there were ear infection 4 patients (19.0%), eczema, and erythema reported in 3 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 217/293 
 
 
(14.3%) each; in Part 2, among the AEs occurring in ≥5% of patients in Part 2 there were also 
maculo-papular rash (4 patients, 9.8%), rash (3 patients, 7.3%). These AEs under the PT of rash, 
together with diarrhoea, are already reported in the proposed Table of ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Given the lack of a control group in the studies on Type 1 SMA, it is not possible to draw definite 
conclusions on the actual drug relationship for most these AEs. The applicant provided explanations 
and justifications for not including some of the abovementioned AEs in the Table of ADRs in the SmPC 
section 4.8. According to the applicant, it is plausible that infection-related AEs, in particular infections 
of the respiratory tract, cough, and events related to respiratory failure, represent a consequence of 
the underlying more severe SMA phenotype. AEs like constipation, vomiting, urinary tract infections 
could be confounded by the underlying disease; ear infection was not included as ADR because no 
increase of this AE was observed over time with patient’s age as alternative explanation. Pneumonia 
was not included as ADR because difference in serious events of pneumonia in SUNFISH Study could 
be explained by unexpectedly low rate of events in the placebo group and because events generally 
resolved despite ongoing treatment.   
11 patients (14.3%) had at least one AE that had not resolved by the CCOD; the AE outcome was 
unknown for 3 patients (3.9%). 
In Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, the most commonly reported AEs (>5% of frequency) were headache 
(16.5%, 67.79 per 100PY), pyrexia (19.1%, 32.85 per 100PY), upper respiratory tract infection 
(22.2%, 37.51 per 100PY), nasopharyngitis (18.3%, 29.12 per 100PY), vomiting (13.9%, 22.83 per 
100PY), cough (11.9%, 20.50 per 100PY), diarrhoea (12.4%, 16.77 per 100PY), nausea (7.7%, 10.72 
per 100PY), gastroenteritis (9.0%, 10.02 per 100PY), pneumonia (6.7%, 9.09 per 100PY), rash 
(6.4%), constipation (4.9%, 6.99 per 100PY), respiratory tract infection (5.2%, 6.52 per 100PY), and 
rhinitis (3.4%, 3.96 per 100PY).  
Of note, headache and nausea were reported only in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients.  
Urinary tract infections occurred with a <5% frequency (3.6%), pain in extremity (4.4%), arthralgia 
(3.9%), back pain (3.6%), dysmenorrhoea (2.8%).  
Overall, the results of SUNFISH (Part 1 and blinded placebo-controlled Part 2) in terms of common AEs 
showed consistent results with the integrated analysis. Of note, in Part 1 among the AEs occurring in 
≥15% of patients there were also oropharyngeal pain (21.6%) as well as pain in extremity (11.8%), 
back pain (7.8%), dysmenorrhoea (5.9%). In Part 2, AEs that occurred with a higher frequency in the 
risdiplam group compared with the placebo group were pyrexia (20.8% vs 16.7%), headache (20.0% 
vs. 16.7%), diarrhoea (16.7% vs. 8.3%); AE diarrhoea is already included in the proposed ADR Table 
of the SmPC section 4.8. Pyrexia could be confounded by concurrent infections. However, pyrexia and 
headache were reported with a 4.1% and 3.3% higher frequency in patients treated with risdiplam 
compared with placebo.     
Other AEs occurring with a higher frequency in risdiplam group compared with placebo were: 
pneumonia (8.3% [10 patients], vs. 6.7% [4 patients]), viral upper respiratory tract infection (4.2% 
[5] vs. 1.7 [1]), gastroenteritis viral (3.3% [4] vs. 1.7% [1]), urinary tract infection (4.2 [5] vs. 0), 
cystitis (2.5% [3] vs. 0), mouth ulceration (4.2% [5] vs. 0), aphthous ulcer (2.5% [3] vs. 0), rash 
(7.5% [9] vs. 1.7% [1]), eczema (4.2% [5] vs. 1.7% [1]), erythema and rash maculo-papular, (2.5% 
[3] vs. 0), acne, dermatitis allergic, dry skin, rash erythematous (1.7% [2] vs. 0), migraine (2.5% [3] 
vs. 1.7% [1]), contusion (3.3% [4] vs. 0), fall and joint dislocation (2.5% [3] vs. 0), head injury, and 
ligament sprain (1.7 [2] vs. 0), arthralgia (5.0% [6] vs. 0), pain in extremity and scoliosis (3.3% [4] 
vs. 1.7% [1]), myalgia (2.5% [3] vs. 0), activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (1.7% [2] vs. 
0), C-reactive protein increased (1.7% [2] vs. 0), decreased appetite, dysmenorrhea (1.7% [2] vs. 0), 
seasonal allergy (3.3% [4] vs. 1.7% [1]).

Some of the AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, such as rash maculo-papular, 
erythema, dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, rash erythematous are already included in the ADR Table of 
the SmPC section 4.8 under the PT rash.  
The applicant specified that AEs in the SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications such as 
contusion, fall, joint dislocation, head injury, and ligament sprain were considered unrelated to study 
treatment and all resolved except for one AE of joint dislocation which is expected to have a prolonged 
course. Furthermore, the applicant pointed out that although the non-fracture events occurred more 
frequently in patients in the risdiplam arm, the rate of fracture events was comparable across both 
arms. 
AEs like arthralgia, pain in extremity, myalgia, and scoliosis were not included by the applicant among 
the ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8 because they resolved despite ongoing treatment (except for events 
of scoliosis), did not lead to study treatment change, and were considered related to the underlying 
disease. Arthralgia occurred with a relatively high frequency, in 5.0% of risdiplam patients versus none 
in the placebo group.  
The higher rate of pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections, in general, in Type 1 SMA patients 
compared to Type 2 and 3 SMA patients may be related to the higher severity of the disease observed 
with the Type 1 SMA phenotype. 
Urinary tract infection, cystitis, mouth ulceration, aphthous ulcer, occurred only in the risdiplam arm 
versus none in the placebo group of SUNFISH Part 2 and the last two AEs were considered related to 
study treatment by the investigators.  
79 patients (20.4%) had at least one AE that had not resolved by the CCOD; the AE outcome was 
unknown for 4 patients (1.0%).  
Initially there were 7 patients in the two SMA patient populations for whom AE outcome was unknown. 
Additional information regarding the seven patients with unknown AE outcome at the CCOD was 
provided: Three resolved or resolved with sequelae, 1 (nasal congestion) was reported as not 
recovered/not resolved, and the outcome of 3 AEs remained unknown (1 teething, 1 hepatocellular 
injury and 1 drooling in a deceased patient).  
In the All Patients with SMA pool, the AE rate decreased over time with continued risdiplam treatment, 
with the highest rate of AEs observed during 0−≤6 months of treatment (746.71 per 100PY [95% CI: 
709.11, 785.78]) followed by 525.06 per 100 PY [95% CI: 486.33, 566.05]) during the >6−≤12 months 
period.  The decline in rates was observed in both the Type 1 SMA, and Type 2 and 3 SMA populations 
as described in the sections below.

In the All SMA Patient Population, Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 18.9% of patients at a rate of 26.47 per 100PY 
and were most commonly reported in the SOC Infection and Infestations and in the Type 1 SMA patients compared 
with the Type 2 and 3 SMA patients that instead experienced Grade 1 AEs more frequently.    
Indeed, in Type 1 SMA patients, Grade 1 and 2 AEs occurred in 48.1% of patients (359.23 and 138.92 
per 100PY, respectively), while Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 45.5% of patients with a higher 
percentage for Grade 3 AEs (49.92, 21.71, and 7.60 per 100PY for Grade 3, 4 and 5, respectively). 
Grade ≥3 AEs occurred more frequently in the SOC Infections and Infestations (31.47, 7.60, and 4.34 
per 100PY for Grade 3, 4, and 5, respectively). AEs of all grades declined over time particularly Grade 
4 and 5 AEs.  
In Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, Grade 1 and 2 AEs occurred in the majority of patients (68.8%) (430.99 
and 121.38 per 100PY, respectively), while Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported in 13.7% of patients 
(21.43, and 1.16 per 100PY for Grade 3 and 4, respectively). There were no Grade 5 AEs in this 
patient population. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred more frequently in the SOC Infections and Infestations 
(10.95 and 0.47 per 100PY for Grade 3 and 4, respectively). AEs of all grades declined over time 
particularly Grade 1 and 2 AEs while Grade 3 and 4 AEs remained relatively stable over time.  
Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Treatment 
The majority of AEs were reported as unrelated to study treatment. In the All Patients with SMA 
population, 65 patients (14.0%) had at least 1 AE that was reported as related to study treatment, and 
a total of 100 related AEs were reported.  The rate of AEs reported as related to study treatment was 
19.18 per 100PY (95% CI: 15.61, 23.33) and was comparable in both SMA populations.  Overall, 3.3% 
of all reported AEs were reported as related.  The rate of AEs reported as related to study treatment 
was 19.18 per 100PY (95% CI: 15.61, 23.33), and comparable between patients with Type 1 SMA and 
patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA.

The most frequently reported related AE by PT was diarrhoea (9 patients, 1.9%), followed by nausea 
(7 patients, 1.5%), rash (5 patients, 1.1%), and headache (5 patients, 1.1%). The majority of AEs 
resolved.  The rate of AEs reported as related to study treatment decreased approximately 5.5-fold 
over time, between the 0−6 months period (40.95 per 100 PY [95% CI: 32.52, 50.90]) and the 6-12 
months period (7.72 per 100PY [95% CI: 3.70, 14.20]).  This decrease in rate of related AEs was 
comparable in both SMA populations. 
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
In the patients with Type 1 SMA, a total of 15 treatment-related AEs were reported in 9 patients 
(11.7%) at a rate of 16.28 per 100PY (95% CI: 9.11, 26.85).  Overall 2.8% of all reported AEs were 
reported as related.  The rate of related AEs decreased approximately 5.5-fold between the 0-6 
months (38.64 per 100 PY [95% CI: 20.57; 66.07]) and 6−12 months treatment intervals (6.92 per 
100 PY [95% CI: 0.84, 25.01]).  No related AEs were reported after 12 months of treatment.  The 
most frequently reported related AEs by PT were rash maculo-papular (2 patients, 2.6%), skin 
discoloration (2 patients, 2.6%), constipation (2 patients, 2.6%), and neutropenia (2 patients, 2.6%).

despite ongoing treatment with risdiplam.  One related AE was serious (neutropenia). As regard to the 
AEs of skin discoloration, investigators considered these events related to study treatment. 
The results on the type of AEs considered related to treatment from FIREFISH (Study BP39056) were 
consistent with the integrated safety analysis. In Part 1, 2/21 patients experienced a total of 3 AEs that 
were considered by the investigator as related to study medication: macule, neutropenia, and 
diarrhoea that resolved. In all cases the dose of risdiplam was not changed. In Part 2, up to the CCOD, 
7/41 patients (17.1%) (enrolled at the 2 study sites in China) experienced a total of 12 related AEs: 
rash maculo-papular, skin discoloration, and constipation (2, 4.9% each), eosinophilia, neutropenia, 
upper respiratory tract infection, neutrophil count decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
and pulmonary hypertension (1, 2.4% each).  
Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA 
In the patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, a total of 85 treatment-related AEs were reported in 56 
patients (14.4%) at a rate of 19.80 per 100PY (95% CI: 15.82, 24.49).  Overall, 3.4% of all reported 
AEs were reported as related. The most frequently reported related AEs by PT were diarrhoea (8 
patients, 2.1%), nausea (7 patients, 1.8%), rash (5 patients, 1.3%), and headache (5 patients, 
1.3%).   
Other AEs considered as treatment-related were: aphthous ulcer and dry skin (3, 0.8% each), mouth 
ulceration, skin exfoliation, weight increased, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection (2, 0.5% 
each). As regard to dizziness, in SUNFISH Part 2 no patient in the risdiplam arm reported dizziness 
versus 2 patients in the placebo arm. 
Most events reported as related to risdiplam resolved despite ongoing treatment with risdiplam.  
Fifteen AEs reported as related in 11 patients had not resolved by CCOD.  
The unresolved events did not worsen over time with the exception of 3 AEs in two patients:  one 
patient had livedo reticularis and cyanosis that went from Grade 1 to Grade 2 intensity and another 
patient had weight increased that also went from Grade 1 to Grade 2.  
One related AE was serious (supraventricular tachycardia).  
The majority of AEs were reported as unrelated to study treatment.  
The results on the type of AEs considered related to treatment from SUNFISH (Study BP39055) were 
consistent with the results of the integrated safety analysis. In Part 1, a total of 20 related AEs 
occurred in 10/51 (19.6%): the most frequent was rash (3 patients, 5.9%); other AEs occurred in only 
1 patient each (2.0%) (erythema, hyperkeratosis, palmar erythema, skin exfoliation, abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, nausea, oral mucosal erythema, dizziness, headache, tachycardia, granuloma, hepatic 
enzyme increase, decreased appetite, amenorrhea, nasal dryness). All AEs reported as related to study 
medication resolved with the exception of erythema, nasal dryness, palmar erythema, skin exfoliation, 
rash and headache. There was no change of treatment. During the placebo-controlled period of Part 1, 
16 AEs in 13 patients (All risdiplam: 9 patients; All placebo: 4 patients) occurred. The treatment-
related AEs were rash (2 patients in All risdiplam vs. 0 in All Placebo group), hyperkeratosis, diarrhoea, 
nausea, oral mucosal erythema, hepatic enzyme increased, decreased appetite, dizziness, granuloma 
(1 vs. 0); tachycardia (1 vs. 1); hyperpyrexia (0 vs. 1). 
In Part 2, during the double-blind, placebo-controlled period, 22 patients had a total of 30 related AEs. 
The overall percentage of patients with at least one related AE was slightly higher in the risdiplam arm 
compared with the placebo arm (13.3% [16] vs. 10.0% [6]): mouth ulceration, nausea, upper 
respiratory tract infection, headache (2 patients each, 1.7%), abdominal pain upper, dermatitis

acneiform, , eczema, rash, rash maculo-papular, skin discoloration, gastroenteritis viral, palpitations, 
cataract subcapsular, posterior capsule opacification, hypercholesterolemia (1 patient each). All AEs 
reported as related to study medication resolved without change to study medication with the 
exception of dry skin in 1 patient and 2 AEs of cataract in 1 patient. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
At the CCOD, no AESIs had been reported. No Hy’s law cases were observed. 
Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA 
Adverse events of special interest were reported in 2 patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA:  
●  One patient (SUNFISH Part 1) reported 2 non-serious AESIs (dyspnoea and tongue oedema). On 
Study Day 480 (last dose of risdiplam on Day 479), the patient (23-year-old White female, non-
ambulant) woke up during the night with a sensation of tongue oedema and dyspnoea and was 
diagnosed with probable allergic reaction that resolved in less than 30 minutes from onset. These 
AEs were assessed as unrelated to risdiplam by the investigator. Treatment with risdiplam was 
not changed due to these events;  
●  Another patient (JEWELFISH) reported 4 AESIs: cyanosis (reported term acrocyanosis), livedo 
reticularis, pruritus generalised, and rash. The patient (46-year-old White male, ambulant) was 
previously enrolled in study BP29420 (MOONFISH Study on the splicing modifier RO6885247). 
His medical history included scoliosis and sinus bradycardia. Treatment with risdiplam was not 
changed due to these events. Grade 1-2 rash and pruritus generalised occurred on Day 124 and 
resolved. There was no change in study drug due to these events. The Investigator considered 
rash and pruritus generalised, to be related to risdiplam and possibly related to disease under 
study. The sponsor assessed that the rash and pruritus generalised resolved under continuation 
of risdiplam therapy which does not speak for a causal relationship with the study medication. 
Grade  1-2  cyanosis  (acrocyanosis)  and  livedo  reticularis  occurred  on  Day  132.  The  patient 
presented with an episode of cutaneous blue discoloration of the distal limbs (fingers, toes, and 
calf);  however,  no  pain,  swelling  or  fever  were  reported.  The  same  day,  an  unspecified 
angiological  examination  revealed  non-serious  cyanosis  and  livedo  reticularis  (for  both,  initial 
Grade  1  and  extreme  Grade  2).  Treatment  included  triamcinolone  acetonide  for  the  events. 
Reportedly, these symptoms occurred episodically. The events of livedo reticularis and cyanosis 
remained unresolved at the time of clinical cut-off day (i.e., 640 days after the event onset). 
There was no change in study drug due to the events. The Investigator considered cyanosis and 
livedo  reticularis,  to  be  related  to  risdiplam  and  possibly  related  to  disease  under  study.  The 
sponsor assessed that the episodic appearance of livedo reticularis with acrocyanosis does not 
speak for a causal relationship with the study drug. 
No Hy’s law cases were observed in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Effects on Epithelial Tissues 
In chronic toxicology studies in rodents and monkeys, adverse effects on epithelial tissues (skin, 
larynx, eyelid, and gastrointestinal tract) were observed. These effects were observed within days or 
weeks of treatment, were dose-dependent in severity, and occurred with high incidence due to 
risdiplam-induced alternative splicing of other off target genes (FoxM1 and MADD). The first clinical 
sign in monkeys was mild parakeratosis at exposures more than 2.5-fold the exposure observed at the 
pivotal dose selected for patients with SMA.  These findings were reversible upon discontinuation of 
dosing with risdiplam but persisted with continuous dosing and worsened at high doses with breakage 
of the skin barrier when animals were dosed through.

Table 60 
In the All Patients with SMA population, 171 AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders were reported in 110 patients (23.7%) at a rate of 32.80 per 100PY (95% CI: 28.07, 38.10).  
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021

Twenty-five AEs in 18 patients (3.9%) were reported as related to study treatment; all except 4 events 
in 2 patients (livedo reticularis, palmar erythema, erythema, and skin exfoliation) resolved despite 
ongoing treatment with risdiplam. 
Fourteen patients (3.0%) had at least 1 AE that had not resolved by the CCODs for this analysis; these 
were: 5 cases of acne and one case each of: dermatitis, dermatitis atopic, dry skin, dyshidrotic 
eczema, erythema, hair growth abnormal, hypertrichosis, livedo reticularis, palmar erythema, 
seborrhoeic dermatitis, skin disorder, skin exfoliation, skin odour abnormal.  
Unresolved skin events did not lead to a change in study medication and did not worsen despite 
ongoing treatment, with the exception of livedo reticularis, which was reported in one patient with 
multiple skin related AEs which were reported as related to study medication.  The event of mild dry 
skin with onset on Day 18 resolved without change to study medication after 39 days.  The events of 
moderate pruritus and rash with onset on Day 124 resolved without change to study medication after 7 
days.  On Study Day 132 the patient reported with moderate livedo reticularis associated with 
moderate cyanosis in fingers (coding to SOC cardiac disorders and reported verbatim as acrocyanosis) 
with a chronic intermittent course, unresolved at CCOD and considered possibly secondary to vascular 
manifestations of SMA.  
An approximately 2-fold decline in the rate of AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
was observed over time from 55.11 per 100PY (95% CI: 45.25, 66.47) in the first 6 months of 
treatment to 27.03 per 100PY (95% CI: 18.82, 37.59) during the >6−≤12 months period, after which 
the rate appeared to stabilise, at 19.73 per 100PY (95% CI: 12.21, 30.16) during the >12−≤18 months 
period. This decline, which is more pronounced than for overall AEs, may be in part due to patients 
getting older given that skin related AEs were generally declining with age in patients below 18 years 
of age.   
In a young population such as that affected by Type 1 and Type 2 and 3 SMA, skin-related disorders 
can be frequent compared with older subjects. However, in the double-blind, placebo-controlled 
SUNFISH Part 2 there is a higher frequency (approximately 3-fold higher) of epithelial tissue-related 
AEs in patients receiving risdiplam compared with those receiving placebo (30.8% vs. 11.7%). AEs 
reported in more than 1 patient from this SOC in the risdiplam arm were rash (9 patients), eczema (5 
patients), erythema (3 patients), rash maculo-papular (3 patients) and (in 2 patients each) acne, 
dermatitis allergic, dry skin, and rash erythematous. In the placebo arm, all AEs were single 
occurrences. All events were mild to moderate in intensity and none of the events were reported as a 
SAE or led to a change in study medication. Events were mostly reported as unrelated to study 
medication with the exception of 6 events in 6 patients in the risdiplam arm (dermatitis acneiform, dry 
skin, eczema, rash, rash maculo-papular and skin discolouration) and 1 event in one patient in the 
placebo arm (dermatitis herpetiformis). Events resolved in most patients with the exception of 7 
patients in the risdiplam arm and 1 patient in the placebo arm. AEs which were unresolved at the 
CCOD are events expected to have a prolonged course: acne, dry skin, seborrheic dermatitis, 
dermatitis contact, dyshidrotic eczema, hair growth abnormal, pityriasis rosea, intertrigo (this last in 
the placebo arm), all reported as unrelated to study treatment.  
Some of these AEs are already included in the ADRs Table of the SmPC section 4.8 under the PT 
“rash”. Other AEs occurred in only 1 or 2 patients in the risdiplam arm versus none in the placebo arm 
(particularly skin discolouration but also eczema, skin erosion, dry skin, dermatitis atopic, hair growth 
abnormal, pruritus, pityriasis rosea, etc.) can be suggestive of an effect of risdiplam on skin and 
epithelial tissues in general. 
Ophthalmology Adverse Events 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 232/293 
 
 
In a 39-week study in cynomolgus monkeys, retinal toxicity was observed in all animals at exposures 
above the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) i.e., at approximately 2-fold the exposures 
observed at the pivotal dose selected for patients with SMA.  These consisted of peripheral 
photoreceptor loss and hyper-reflective retinal pigment epithelium which was not fully 
reversible as well as, at higher exposures, reversible microcystic macular degeneration in the 
macula.  The expected initial clinical symptoms of such structural changes in the peripheral retina 
would be impaired night vision or loss of peripheral vision.  Blindness was not observed in any of the 
monkeys even at high doses (approximately 4 times the exposures achieved at the pivotal dose in 
patients with SMA) after 9 months of daily administration of risdiplam.  These findings were not 
observed in albino or pigmented rats when dosed chronically with risdiplam at exposures exceeding 
those administered to monkeys. 
Due to this nonclinical finding, a comprehensive panel of ophthalmological assessments was performed 
in all clinical studies in SMA patients, including imaging to detect structural changes of the retina, and 
visual function testing to detect potential functional impairment in central or peripheral vision. 
Duration of Ophthalmological Follow-Up 
In  general,  over  90%  of  the  465  patients  successfully  completed  their  SD-OCT  assessments  as 
scheduled. 
Duration of ophthalmological follow-up was: 
●  386 patients at least 8 weeks  
●  330 patients at least 6 months (26 weeks)  
●  243 patients at least 1 year (52 weeks) 
●  72 patients at least 2 years (104 weeks) 
●  12 patients completed 3 years (156 weeks)  
The longest duration of follow-up in patients aged 7 months or less at enrollment was 2 years and 9 
months (143 weeks). 
Review of Numerical Parameters Over Time 
While  for  the  younger  patients,  assessments  relied  on  overall  interpretation  by  the  ophthalmologist, 
numerical  results  for  the  following  assessments  were  available  from  the  patients  who  were  able  to 
perform  the  more  difficult  assessments:  at  least  70%  of  patients  for  SD-OCT,  BCVA  and  IOP,  and 
approximately 50% of patients Visual field threshold perimetry: 
Retinal imaging:  
o  SD-OCT  assessment  with  PPole  and  Cross  hair  scans:    macular  volume  and  retinal 
thickness 
Visual field: 
o  Threshold perimetry: fixation losses, threshold sensitivities across the visual field, mean 
deviation, and pattern standard deviation 
Visual acuity: 
o  BCVA: LogMar score, number of optotypes 
o  Sloan LCVA: contrast sensitivity and total number of letters correctly read

Results: 
All SMA Patients 
Overall, 33 AEs in the SOC Eye disorders were reported in 29 patients (6.2%) in the All Patients with 
SMA population.  
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
Overall, 6 AEs in the SOC Eye disorders were reported in 5 patients (6.5%). All AEs were mild, 
reported as unrelated to study medication, and resolved without change to risdiplam treatment, with 
the exception of 2 AEs in 2 patients: 1 AE of moderate strabismus at Month 20, in FIREFISH, 
considered as unrelated; 1 AE of moderate heterophoria in both eyes at Month 12, in FIREFISH.   
Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA 
Overall, 27 AEs in the SOC Eye disorders were reported in 24 patients (6.2%). All AEs were mild, 
unrelated to study medication and resolved without change of study therapy, with the exception of 7 
AEs reported in 6 patients. One patient had an AE of mild visual impairment unresolved at the CCOD 
(minimal decrease in sight, -0.5 dioptries) with an onset on Study Day 324 and no corresponding 
findings were reported in other ophthalmological tests. It was assessed as unrelated to risdiplam and 
had not resolved at CCOD, glasses were recommended. 1 AE of moderate dry eye (onset on Day 266) 
resolved and considered unrelated without corresponding findings at ophthalmological assessments; 1

AE of moderate lacrimation increased, resolved; 1 AE of moderate eye allergy, resolved; 1 AE of 
moderate corneal infiltrates with lamp examination showing corneal infiltrates in the left eye, 
subsequently resolved; 1 macular cyst detected on SD-OCT assessment reported as related to study 
treatment that was not confirmed at subsequent assessments; 
In addition to the AEs in the SOC of Eye disorders, there was another eye-related AE which had not 
resolved, in the SOC of Neoplasms: one patient had an AE of mild eye naevus (conjunctival naevus in 
the right eye) with onset Day 15 which remained unresolved and was assessed as unrelated to study 
therapy. 
In the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2, more patients in the placebo group had AEs in 
the SOC Eye disorders compared with risdiplam arm (10.0% vs. 6.7%). The AEs that occurred in at 
least 1 patient of the risdiplam group versus none in the placebo group were: cataract subcapsular, 
eye pruritus, eyelid disorder, ocular hyperaemia, posterior capsular opacification, vision blurred, visual 
impairment (1 each vs. 0). All events were reported as unrelated to study treatment and resolved 
except for 3 AEs in 2 patients: 1 mild AE of visual impairment, already mentioned above, considered 
unrelated to treatment in a patient that lost 0.5 dioptries and was advised to wear glasses in the 
absence of findings observed at OCT and with a subsequent BCVA improved compared to baseline; 2 
mild events of cataract subcapsular and posterior capsule opacification both reported as related to 
treatment, but not confirmed at subsequent assessment made after CCOD.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
A total of 103 patients (22.2%) in the All Patients with SMA population reported 194 SAEs.  The rate of 
SAEs per 100PY was 37.21 (95% CI: 32.16, 42.83).  Serious AEs were most commonly reported in the 
SOC Infections and infestations; at a rate of 21.10 per 100PY (95% CI: 17.34, 25.43) and in the 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders with a rate of 6.14 per 100PY (95% CI: 4.20, 8.66).  
No SAEs were reported in the SOCs Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders or Eye disorders.

The rate of SAEs was overall approximately 3.5-fold higher in patients with Type 1 SMA (54.5% of 
patients, at a rate of 93.33 per 100PY [95% CI: 74.66, 115.27]) compared with patients with Type 2 
and 3 SMA (15.7%, at a rate of 25.16 per 100PY [95% CI: 20.64, 30.38].  This difference was mainly 
driven by the higher rate of SAEs in the Type 1 SMA patients compared with Type 2 and 3 SMA 
patients in the SOC of Infection and Infestations (42.9% of patients vs. 10.3%, at a rate of 53.18 vs. 
14.21 per 100PY) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (16.9% of patients vs. 1.8%, at 
a rate of 23.88 vs. 2.33 per 100PY), and in particular by the AE pneumonia (23.4% [18 patients] at a 
rate of 23.88 per 100PY vs. 4.4% [17 patients] at a rate of 5.82 per 100PY). All SAEs pneumonia 
resolved except for two fatal cases in patients with Type 1 SMA. 
Due to low exposure time in PY beyond 18 months, rates after 18 months should be viewed with 
caution.  Although the rate overall was stable, a clear decline in SAE rates over time was observed in 
patients with Type 1 SMA.  In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, a trend towards higher SAE rates was 
observed in the first 18 months of treatment followed by a decrease thereafter. 
SAEs were reported as unrelated to risdiplam with the exception of: 
- 
- 
one patient with an SAE of neutropenia in the type 1 SMA group. The patient had a neutrophil 
count  of  0.23⋅109/L  (normal  range:  1.5 8.5  ⋅109/L)  on  Study  Day  280,  which  occurred  in  the 
context of an SAE of pneumonia on Study Day 282.  Both events resolved (neutropenia after 3 
days and pneumonia after 7 days), and the dose of risdiplam was not changed as a result of 
these SAEs. 
and one patient in the Type 2 and 3 SMA group that had an SAE of supraventricular tachycardia, 
reported on study Day 49 and maximum intensity (Grade 2), occurred in the context of hypoxia 
secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection. It resolved without change to study medication.

SAEs that resulted in dose interruption were reported in 15 patients, with interruptions ranging from 
1 19 days. Risdiplam treatment was permanently discontinued due to an AE in one patient with Type 1 
SMA who discontinued risdiplam due to an AE of respiratory tract infection viral to receive palliative 
care 3 days prior to her death.  One patient had an SAE (decreased appetite) with no outcome 
reported as of the CCOD. All SAEs resolved with the exception of one report of partial seizures in one 
patient in the Type 2 and 3 SMA group, occurring during the open-label period of the SUNFISH Part 2.  
In Type 1 SMA pool, a total of 42 patients (54.5%) with Type 1 SMA reported 86 SAEs. Besides the 
abovementioned infection- and respiratory SAEs, other frequent SAEs occurring in at least 1 patient 
were: dehydration, cardiac arrest, hypotonia (2.6% [2]), vomiting, decreased appetite, sinus 
tachycardia, hydrocephalus, neutropenia, cryptorchism, weight decreased (1.3% [1]). It is plausible 
that most of these SAEs reflect possible complications related to the underlying disease. Two SAEs 
were associated with congenital abnormalities (cryptorchism and hydrocephalus).  
Only one SAE, i.e. neutropenia, was considered treatment-related by the investigator: the patient had 
a neutrophil count of 0.23x109/L (normal range: 1.5-8.5x109/L) on Study Day 280, which occurred in 
the context of a SAE of pneumonia on Study Day 282. Both events resolved (neutropenia after 3 days 
and pneumonia after 7 days), and the dose of risdiplam was not changed as a result of these SAEs. 
All SAEs resolved by CCOD except for the abovementioned SAE, i.e. decreased appetite, for which no 
outcome was reported as of CCOD. The results on the SAEs from FIREFISH (Study BP39056) were 
consistent with the integrated safety analysis. 
In Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, a total of 61 patients (15.7%) reported 108 SAEs. Besides the 
abovementioned infection- and respiratory SAEs, other frequent SAEs occurring in at least 1 patient 
were: femur fracture, vomiting, pyrexia, (0.8% [3 patients]), gastritis, dehydration, (0.5% [2]), brain 
contusion, concussion, contusion, fall, femoral neck fracture, near drowning, tibia fracture, 
constipation, nausea, oesophagitis, decreased appetite, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, 
hypotonia, partial seizures, back pain, kyphoscoliosis, haematuria, hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis 
(0.3% [1]).  
One SAE of supraventricular tachycardia was reported in JEWELFISH study that was considered by the 
Investigator to be related to study treatment. Patient was previously enrolled in Study WN29836 
(Olesoxime). The SAE was reported on study Day 49 and maximum intensity (Grade 2) occurred in the 
context of hypoxia secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection. Supraventricular tachycardia was 
well tolerated without hemodynamic impact and resolved with adenosine after failure of vagal 
manoeuvres. No ECG details were provided. 
All SAEs resolved by CCOD except for 1 SAE, i.e., as mentioned above, partial seizures occurring 
during the open-label period of the SUNFISH Part 2. This was a case of an 11-year-old female (White) 
non-ambulant patient without medical history besides SMA, that on Study Day 592 presented Grade 3 
partial seizures; she was hospitalised and was started on treatment with antiepileptic medications; EEG 
were reported as normal. The event of partial seizures remained unresolved at the time of clinical cut-
off day (i.e.49 days after the event onset). There was no change in risdiplam treatment due to this 
event. The Investigator considered partial seizures to be unrelated to risdiplam and related to medical 
history or concurrent illness (suspicion of epilepsy). 
The results on the SAEs from SUNFISH (Study BP39055) were consistent with the integrated safety 
analysis. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Part 2, 20.0% of patients receiving 
risdiplam (24/120) and 18.3% of those receiving placebo (11/60) experienced a total of 39 and 14 
SAEs, respectively (rate 32.72 vs. 23.29 per 100PY). Less patients aged 18 to 25 years had SAEs 
compared to those aged 2 to 18 years. SAE occurring with a higher rate in risdiplam patients compared 
with placebo patients or only in patients receiving risdiplam were: pneumonia (7.5% [9] vs. 1.7% [1]), 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 241/293 
 
 
bacteraemia and influenza, pyrexia (1.7% [2] vs. 0), bronchitis, laryngitis, lower respiratory tract 
infection viral, pneumonia bacterial, upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract 
infection, aspiration, asthma, atelectasis, pneumonia aspiration, fall, hydronephrosis, constipation, 
febrile convulsion (0.8% [1] vs. 0). None of these SAEs were considered related to study treatment. 
SAEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 3.3% of patients in both the risdiplam and placebo arms. 
The rate of SAE was higher in the risdiplam arm compared with placebo in the first 6 months, then in 
the 6 to 12-month period declined in the risdiplam group and increased 2.5-fold in the placebo group. 
Overall, in the integrated safety dataset, in All SMA Patient Population, the SAE rate was stable over 
the first 18 months of treatment (0-6 months: 42.47; 6-12 months: 40.15; 12-18 months: 37.58 per 
100PY). Rates after 18 months should be interpreted with caution due to low exposure time in PY 
beyond 18 months. SAE rates declined more markedly in Type 1 SMA patients while in Type 2 and 3 
SMA there was a trend towards an increase of rate in the first 18 months followed by a decrease. 
Deaths 
At the time of the CCOD for each study, 6 deaths had been reported during the treatment period, all of 
which were infants with Type 1 SMA in Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) who died of SMA-related respiratory 
complications (3 deaths in Part 1 and 3 deaths in Part 2; 3 females and 3 males; age range: 136-212 
days at first dose [approximately, 4.5-7.0 months]); 2 White and 3 Asian, 1 patient of unknown race).  
One additional patient (Asian male) died 3.5 months after discontinuation from risdiplam therapy 
during the safety follow-up period.  
The cause of death was classified as “progressive disease” in 6 out of 7 cases and as “adverse event” 
(pneumonia) for 1 patient.  None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study treatment. 
All six patients who died had advanced disease at baseline: they all had disease duration greater than 
3 months at baseline and 4 patients were older than 5 months of age at first dose. 4/6 patients died 
within 3 months (range: 21-79 days) of starting treatment with risdiplam, prior to any efficacy 
assessment.  
In the 2 patients and with available post-baseline efficacy assessments, there was evidence of improved 
motor function, as indicated by increases from baseline in the CHOP-INTEND total score). 
The causes of the 6 deaths were: viral respiratory tract infection (Day 21; 3 days after receiving the 
last dose), cardiac arrest and respiratory failure (Day 236, approximately 8 months; 1 day after the 
last dose), respiratory tract infection (Day 387, approximately 1 year; 1 day after the last dose) (this 
is the only patient who underwent autopsy), acute respiratory failure (Day 68; 1 day after the last 
dose; of note, this patient was diagnosed with a Grade 1 hepatocellulary injury considered not related 
to risdiplam by the investigators), pneumonia (Day 51; 1 day after the last dose). All these causes of 
deaths were classified as “progressive disease”. In 1 case of pneumonia (Day 79, 1 day after the last 
dose) the cause of death was classified as “adverse event”.  
Patient who died during the safety follow-up was an Asian male, aged 112 days at first dose, who died 
of cardiac arrest on Day 691 (approximately 2 years), 106 days (approximately 4 months) after 
receiving the last dose. The patient experienced acute airway obstruction from secretion/mucous plug 
which caused hypoxia and consequently cardiac arrest. The cause of death was classified as 
“progressive disease”.

Laboratory findings 
Haematological parameters 
During nonclinical studies with risdiplam, bone marrow depression with decreased cell counts across all 
4 blood cell lines (erythroid, granulocytic, monocytic, and megakaryocytic) were observed at exposures 
at least 4 times higher than the mean exposures observed in the clinical studies. At high doses, this 
effect occurred with high incidence due to an effect of risdiplam on alternative targets, the MADD and 
FOXM1 genes involved in cell division and apoptosis.   
Regarding haematological findings, isolated shifts in laboratory parameters were observed;  
Across timepoints, the mean percentage change from baseline ranged from:  
i) -20% to 37% for lymphocytes (Type 1 SMA: -22% to 11%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: -20% to 37%);  
ii) -35% to 119% for neutrophils (Type 1 SMA: -4% to 424%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: -35% to 61%);  
iii) -6% to 2% for erythrocytes (Type 1 SMA: -6% to 8%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: -11% to -0.5%)  
iv) -13% to 50% for platelets (Type 1 SMA: -13% to 88%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: -1% to 54%) 
The maximum individual decreases were observed more in the Type 1 patients compared with the 
Type 2 and 3 SMA patients (-93% vs. -72% for lymphocytes; -89% vs. -79% for neutrophils; -48% vs. 
-39% for erythrocytes; -100% vs. -95% for platelets).  
The highest AE intensity was observed for lymphopenia (Grade 3 in Type 1 SMA and Grade 2 in Type 2 
and 3 SMA), neutropenia (Grade 4 and Grade 3, respectively), and thrombocytopenia (Grade 4 each) 
in few subjects.  
In type 1 SMA patients, 6 reported AEs suggestive of a clinically significant decline in cell lines. In 
particular one patient (with already low neutrophil values at screening) experienced an AE of 
neutropenia (onset on Day 14) reported as related to risdiplam, resolved without change to study 
medication after 43 days. By Day 363 the patient’s neutrophil value was within the normal range. 
Another AE of neutropenia (Grade 4) was reported in one patient in the context of pneumonia (onset 
on Day 280) and was resolved after a short period by Day 294. One patient, who had already low 
haemoglobin values at screening, developed a Grade 2 anaemia (onset on Day 378) which was 
reported as unrelated to risdiplam and remained unresolved at the CCOD. 
In type 2-3 SMA pool, 3 patients reported AEs suggestive of significant changes in laboratory 
parameters. One case of Grade 1 anaemia (onset on Day 611) in a patient with low haemoglobin 
values at baseline, considered as unrelated to risdiplam and resolved on Day 729. Another case of 
Grade 1 neutropenia occurred on Day 175 which resolved after 5 days despite ongoing treatment with 
risdiplam.    
In the double-blind placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2, more patients in the risdiplam arm 
(10.8%) had shift from normal to low in monocyte count compared to placebo arm (3.3%) at their last 
assessment; however, this was not observed consistently throughout the study and was not observed 
for any other cell line. 
In conclusion, overall the results not seem to be significant and mostly not related to the treatment, 
except for the patient with Type 1 SMA that had an SAE of neutropenia

Liver enzymes 
No Hy’s law cases were reported in patients with SMA, which was also confirmed by the liver enzyme 
assessments. In the All SMA Patients population, the number of patients with shifts (to low or high 
values) in AST, ALT or total bilirubin was low, and did not increase over time. 
In Type 1 SMA patients, 5 patients had AST values >3x ULN at a single post-baseline visit. Their AST 
values were elevated at baseline and remained elevated at all post-baseline visits. 3 patients with 
increased AST/ALT >3xULN did not have an associated AE: in 1 patient, the liver enzyme increase 
along with a concurrent decreased neutrophil count were considered related to risdiplam treatment, 
both resolved without change to study medication; in 1 patient, a mild hepatocellular injury occurred 
on Day 58 with AST and ALT <1.5xULN with an unknown outcome, the patient died of respiratory 
failure probably consequent to a respiratory tract infection; another patient, who had previously 
received nusinersen, had an increase in ALT levels >3xULN post-baseline, the patient developed a SAE 
of upper respiratory tract infection. 
In Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, the highest abnormal high value was Grade 3 (>5xULN) for ALT and 
below Grade 2 (<3xULN) for AST. 4 patient had increased AST/ALT >2xULN without an associated AE: 
1 patient had a significant Grade 3 increase in ALT >5x ULN and AST >2x ULN but below 3xULN on 
Day 56, both values had returned to baseline levels on Day 118 and treatment with risdiplam was not 
changed; 1 patient developed ALT above 2 x ULN twice, on Study Day 484 in the context of an AE of 
hand-foot-and-mouth disease and on Study Day 911 when patient had just recovered from an episode 
of gastroenteritis; 1 patient, in the previous treatment group olesoxime had an increase in ALT 
levels >3xULN at baseline and remained >2-3x ULN throughout the study; 1 patient, who in the 
previous treatment group RO6885247 had an increase in ALT levels >5x ULN post-baseline, had a 
significant increase in ALT >5x ULN and AST >2x ULN on Day 56, both values returned to baseline 
levels thereafter through to study day 367.   
AEs associated with liver enzymes occurred in 4 patients: 1 patient had mild hepatic enzymes 
increased on Day 121 which resolved without change to study medication; 1 patient, who in the 
previous group olesoxime had an increase in ALT levels >3xULN postbaseline, with hepatic enzymes 
already elevated at baseline, had a further increase on Day 14 and was reported with AEs of ALT/AST 
increased unrelated to study medication and resolved after 2 weeks without change to study 
medication; 1 patient, who previously was in the treatment group R06885247, had a mild unrelated AE 
of hepatic enzyme increased on Day 187 that resolved 3 days later; 1 patient had mild lipase and 
amylase elevations on Day 186 that resolved.   
During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of SUNFISH Part 2, 2 patients in each arm had 
ALT >3x ULN, one additional patient had ALT >3x ULN during the open-label treatment phase in the 
risdiplam arm. 
Vital signs 
Tachypnea and tachycardia were observed throughout the study in some patients, including at baseline 
in patients with Type 1 SMA.  In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, isolated shifts in pulse rate were 
observed at isolated timepoints. Shifts in other vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure [systolic 
and diastolic]) were observed; however, the percentage of patients with shifts toward higher values 
and shifts toward lower values was similar and did not increase over time.

ECG 
As of the CCODs for this analysis, there were few clinically significant changes from baseline in ECG 
parameters.  
The percentage of patients with average QT, QTcB or QTcF above 450 ms, or change from baseline above 
30 ms, was low and did not increase with time.  The prolonged QT intervals were mostly associated with 
isolated  outliers  in  triplicate  QT  interval  measurement  on  one  or  two  of  the  three  ECGs  obtained  per 
timepoint.  No  relevant  differences  were  reported  between  risdiplam  and  placebo  arms  in  the  double-
blind, controlled period of SUNFISH Part 2.   
According to the applicant, based on the analysis of time-matched ECG and PK data obtained from studies 
BP29840, NP39625, BP39054 (JEWELFISH), and BP39056 (FIREFISH) Part 2, there is no evidence for an 
effect of risdiplam on the QTc interval. 
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
Four  patients  with  Type 1  SMA  had  AEs  during  the  treatment  period  reported  in  the  SOC  of  Cardiac 
disorders and suggestive of clinically significant changes in ECG parameters: 
●  One patient was reported with mild, unrelated bradyarrhythmia on Day 244, which resolved after 
64 days without change to study medication.  ECG parameters are indicative of sinus tachycardia 
until Day 490.  
●  One patient was reported with a serious unrelated event of sinus tachycardia on Day 179 in the 
context of viral infection with fever; sinus tachycardia resolved after 4 days without change to 
study medication.  ECG showed mild tachycardia throughout including Day -1.  
●  One patient was reported with a serious unrelated event of Grade 4 cardiac arrest. 
●  One patient, a White female infant, aged 211 days at enrolment died on Study Day 236, 1 day 
after receiving her last dose of study drug, due to fatal cardiac arrest and respiratory failure, 
both with onset on Study Day 236 and maximum intensity Grade 5.  The cause of death was 
classified as progressive disease.  The investigator assessed the cardiac arrest and respiratory 
failure as not related to risdiplam. 
Patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA 
A  total  of  13  AEs  in  10  patients  with  Type 2  and  3  SMA  that  were  suggestive  of  clinically  significant 
changes in ECG parameters were reported in the SOC of Cardiac disorders. 
●  One patient was reported with a non-serious acrocyanosis (MedDRA PT cyanosis) not suspected 
to be of cardiac origin, as reported in the context of livedo reticularis. 
●  One patient was reported with the serious AE of moderate atrial fibrillation on Study Day 326/Day 
177 on risdiplam therapy, which was confirmed by ECG and occurred in the context of alcohol 
consumption and a history of anxiety. 
●  Three  patients  were  reported  with  AEs  of  non-serious  mild  tachycardia  that  resolved  without 
treatment  and  without  change  to  risdiplam  therapy.  ECG  and  heart  rate  at  screening  were 
normal, or abnormal not clinically significant, and no values were provided at  the time of the 
tachycardia events.  One of the patients had two occurrences of tachycardia after approximately 
12 and 14 months on risdiplam treatment. 
●  One patient in the risdiplam arm, had a clinically significant abnormal ECG result at Week 17 
during the double-blind treatment period.  The patient had average QRS prolongation at 93 msec 
(NR 40-90 msec) (individual measures: 96, 93, 89) and was reported with a Grade 1 non-serious 
AE of bundle branch block which resolved after 70 days.  The patient’s QRS interval measures at 
baseline were 89 msec on average with individual measures at 93, 88 and 87 msec.  
●  One  patient  in  the  risdiplam  arm  had  a  clinically  significant  abnormal  ECG  result  at  Week  70 
during the open-label active treatment period, which was the patient’s last ECG assessment prior 
Assessment report  
EMA/216061/2021 
Page 245/293 
 
 
to the CCOD.  The patient’s ECG showed a T wave inversion which was also reported as a Grade 
1 non-serious AE, unrelated to risdiplam, and unresolved at the CCOD. 
●  One patient in the risdiplam arm had a clinically significant abnormal ECG result at Week 26.  
The patient was reported with a non-serious Grade 1 AE of atrioventricular block with onset on 
Day 187 which resolved after 58 days.  The ECG performed at Week 26 did not show prolonged 
PR interval.  
●  One patient in the placebo arm had a clinically significant abnormal ECG result at Week 70 during 
the  open-label  active  treatment  period,  at  the  last  ECG  prior  to  the  CCOD.    The  patient  was 
reported  with  a  Grade  1  non-serious  AE  of  T  wave  inversion  reported  as  unrelated  to  study 
medication, and unresolved at the CCOD.  
●  One patient in the risdiplam arm had a clinically significant abnormal ECG result at Week 17.  
The  ECG  showed  average  PR  interval  at  162  msec  (NR  80-160)  with  individual  triplicate 
measurements of 156, 182 and 147 msec). No corresponding AE was reported in this patient. 
Tanner Stage  
There was one male patient with delayed puberty at baseline (Tanner stage II at age 15) (n=174 
patients assessed); however, this patient moved into puberty at the Month 24 assessment. Three 
female patients were reported as having delayed puberty at baseline (Tanner stage I). 
No patient with delayed puberty was observed post-baseline (n=45 assessed). 
One 4-year-old obese female patient had a non-serious AE of hypertrichosis (reported as pubic hair 
growth) on Study Day 594 with a Tanner staging of II. On Study Day 594, this patient was noted with 
pubic hair growth and was diagnosed with non-serious Grade 1 hypertrichosis. Tanner stage II was 
reported and the patient had no endocrinopathy. These early changes were assessed secondary to 
overweight. No treatment was given for the event.  The event of hypertrichosis remained unresolved at 
the CCOD. There was no change in study drug due to this event. The Investigator considered 
hypertrichosis to be unrelated to risdiplam.   
One female patient (3-year old white female) in the risdiplam arm had precocious puberty during the 
double-blind period (onset Day 161 [partial date]), which did not result in dose interruption and was 
not related to the study drug.  The AE was considered not serious, did not require treatment, and was 
unresolved at the time of the CCOD for this report.  
Overall, it seems that there is no evidence of an effect of risdiplam on sexual maturation as measured 
by the Tanner stage. 
Male germ cells 
Non-clinical studies showed an effect of risdiplam on male germ cells. Spermatocyte degeneration is 
most likely an effect of risdiplam on splice targets other than SMN2. The effect seems to be reversible 
by nature since no effects were noted on Sertoli cells or on primordial germ cells, which therefore 
retain their function to differentiate into spermatozoa once normal FOXM1 expression (and/or another 
affected splice target) has resumed. Indeed, the effect was reversible in animal studies after 
discontinuation of treatment, as confirmed with other SMN2 splice modifiers of the same class. Thus, in 
terms of clinical management of this effect, any impact on fertility in human males is expected to be 
reversible after one cycle of spermatogenesis. Therefore, normal fertility function would be restored 
within 4 months (one cycle of spermatogenesis plus 5 half-lives of risdiplam after the last dose).

Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Risdiplam was not mutagenic in bacterial tests and there was no evidence of primary DNA-damage in 
vivo following risdiplam administration. Consistent with its effects on cell division and apoptosis, 
risdiplam induced micronucleus in bone marrow as part of a non-DNA reactive mechanism. Since the 
effect is not on the DNA, it is considered to be reversible and damage cannot be passed onto 
subsequent cell generations. At higher doses, the damage manifests as reduction in cellularity in bone 
marrow, an effect, which is monitored in SMA patients with haematology investigation. 
Risdiplam is not tumorigenic in animals when tested in a transgenic model suitable to address non-
genotoxic and genotoxic mechanisms to tumorigenesis. As risdiplam is used to treat a severe, life 
threatening disease, a standard 2-year carcinogenicity study in the rat is planned to be conducted 
post-approval. 
Suicidality 
Suicidal ideation or behaviour, measured with the Columbia-suicide severity rating scale (adults, 
adolescents, and children aged 6-11 years) was infrequently reported at baseline or at any 
postbaseline assessment. There was no evidence for increased incidence of suicidal ideation or 
behaviours with time. 
In the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2, no substantial difference for suicidal ideation 
or behaviour was found between the risdiplam and placebo arms. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
For the analysis of age as intrinsic factor patients are presented in the following categories based on age 
at start of risdiplam treatment: 
Patients aged 0−<2 years (n=67). The overall exposure in this subgroup was 88.8 PY. 
Patients aged 2−<12 years (n=189). The overall exposure in this subgroup was 230.3 PY. 
Patients aged 12−<18 years (n=119). The overall exposure in this subgroup was 123.9 PY. 
Patients aged ≥18 years (n=90). The overall exposure in this subgroup was 78.4 PY.

When summarised by age, the rate of AEs per 100 PY for the overall treatment period was similar in 
age groups below 12 and above 18 years of age: 0−<2 years age group (580.98, 95% CI: 531.92, 
633.34) and the 2−<12 years age group (607.53, 95% CI: 576.11, 640.22), and patients aged ≥18 
years (615.80, 95% CI: 562.10, 673.25).  Rates were lower in patients in the 12-<18 years age group 
(494.92, 95% CI: 456.51, 535.70). 
As per the overall patient population, and analysis by SMA type, the highest rates of AE by SOC were 
Infections and infestations followed by Gastrointestinal disorders for all age groups, except for the ≥18 
years age group, where rates were highest in the SOCs Nervous system disorders followed by 
Infections and infestations and the 0−<2 years age group, where rates were highest in the Infections 
and infestations SOC followed by General administration and site conditions.  The high rate in the SOC 
Nervous system disorders in the ≥18 years age group (173.39 per 100PY [95% CI: 145.48, 205.11]) 
was driven by episodes of headache reported (101 events in 17 patients [18.9%]). 
Grade 3−5 AEs were reported at higher rates in patients below 2 years of age (Grade 3: 48.41 events 
per 100 PY [95% CI: 35.04, 65.21], Grade 4: 22.52 per 100 PY [95% CI: 13.75, 34.78], Grade 5: 
7.88 per 100 PY [95%CI: [3.17, 16.24]) compared with patients in the 2-12 years (Grade 3: 30.83 per 
100 PY [95% CI: 24.08, 38.89], Grade 4: 0.43 per 100 PY [95% CI: 0.01, 2.42]), 12-18 years (Grade 
3: 16.15 per 100 PY [95% CI: 9.86, 24.94], Grade 4: 2.42 per 100 PY [95% CI: 0.50, 7.08]), and 18 
years and older groups (Grade 3: 5.10 per 100 PY [95% CI: 1.39, 13.06], Grade 4: 1.27 per 100 PY 
[95% CI: 0.03, 7.10]).

The rates of AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders appeared to decline with age with 
rates of 41.66 per 100PY (95% CI: 29.33, 57.42) in patients aged 0−<2 years, 35.18 per 100PY (95% 
CI: 27.93, 43.72) in patients aged 2−<12 years, 23.41 per 100PY (95% CI: 15.68, 33.63) in patients 
aged 12−<18 and 30.60 per 100PY (95% CI: 19.61, 45.53) in patients aged ≥18 years.  AEs were 
further assessed by the AEGT for rash, with the majority of the reported events captured under the 
SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.  Rates of AEs in the SOCs General disorders and 
administration site conditions, and Infections and infestations also appeared to decline with age. 
The percentages of treatment-related AEs were comparable between the different age groups with a 
trend towards higher rates in the 2-<12 and ≥18 years age groups (15.3% and 14.4%, respectively, 
vs. 13.4% and 11.8% in the 0-<2 and 12-<18 years age groups, respectively). The rate per 100PY of 
related AEs was comparable across the younger age groups with a trend towards higher rates only in 
patients ≥18 years.  
AEs had resolved  for the majority (82.8%) of patients across all age groups despite ongoing treatment 
with risdiplam, i.e., in 63 patients (94.0%) aged 0-<2 years, 168 patients (88.9%) aged 2−<12 years, 
88 patients (73.9%) aged 12−<18 years, and 66 patients (73.3%) aged ≥18 years. 
Seven fatal AEs occurred in 6 patients (9.0%), only in patients with Type 1 SMA (aged 0−<2 years) in 
line with the severity of the underlying type of SMA. 
Serious AEs were observed more frequently in the younger patient age group of 0−<2 years; a total of 
39 patients (58.2%) reported 81 SAEs.  Of these, SAEs were most commonly reported in the SOC 
Infections and infestations; 46 SAEs were reported in 30 patients (44.8%). Pneumonia was reported in 
18 patients (26.9%) aged 0−<2 years and 17 patients in the older age groups.  SAEs were reported in 
43 patients (22.8%; 80 SAEs) in the 2−<12 years age group, 19 patients (16.0%; 30 SAEs) in the 
12−<18 years age group, and 2 patients (2.2%; 3 SAEs) aged ≥18 years.  
When summarised by age, the rate of SAEs per 100PY for the overall treatment period was at least 
2.5-fold higher in the 0−<2 years age group (91.20, 95% CI: 72.43, 113.35) compared with the rates 
in the 2−<12 years group (34.74, 95% CI: 27.55, 43.24) and the 12-<18 years group (24.22, 95% CI: 
16.34, 34.58).  The rate of SAEs was lowest in patients ≥18 years (3.82; 95% CI: 0.79, 11.18). The 
rate of SAEs decreased approximately 1.5-fold in the 0−<2 age group between the 0-6 month 
treatment period and the >6−12 months period. 
Race 
Of the patients with SMA included in this analysis, 343 patients were White, 63 patients were Asian, 3 
were Black or African American, 2 were identified as Multiple, and race was unknown for 54 patients, 
mostly due to country specific data protection requirements. 
The majority of patients were included in the Type 2 and 3 pool (Asian: 45, Black or African American: 
2, White: 297, Multiple: 2, Unknown: 42).  In patients with Type 1 SMA, the race distribution was as 
follows: Asian: 18, Black or African American: 1, White: 46, Multiple: 0, Unknown: 12. 
The analysis was focused on White and Asian race due to the small number of patients in other race 
categories.  Patients of unknown race were not considered as this will not contribute meaningful 
information on any potential impact of race on the safety profile of risdiplam.

To highlight: 
●  The  proportion  of  patients  with  Type  1  SMA  was  higher  among  Asian  patients  (18  of  63  patients, 
28.6%) than among White patients (46 of 343 patients, 15.5%).  
●  Among the 77 patients with Type 1 SMA, all 15 non-treatment-naïve patients from Study BP39054 
(JEWELFISH) are non-Asian and the majority are ≥2 years of age (10 out of 15 [range: 2−19 years]), 
and thus likely to have milder manifestations of SMA and fewer AEs overall due to older age compared 
to the Asian Type 1 population who are exclusively treatment-naïve and ≤7 months of age. 
The rate of AEs per 100PY for the overall treatment period was similar among Asian patients (483.50, 
95% CI: 433.25, 537.98) and White patients (489.07, 95% CI: 467.31, 511.58).  The rate of AEs per 
100 PY was, however, different between Asian and White patients in the two SMA by Type pools.  In 
patients with Type 1 SMA, the rate was higher among Asian compared to White patients (686.18 AEs 
per 100 PY [95% CI: 578.69, 807.86] and 411.44 per 100 PY [95% CI: 360.31, 467.81], 
respectively).  Conversely, in the Type 2 and 3 population the rate of AEs was higher in White patients 
compared with Asian patients (502.33 per 100 PY [95% CI: 478.49, 527.05] and 396.19 per 100 PY 
[95% CI: 342.26, 456.20], respectively).  The higher rate of AEs in Asian patients with Type 1 SMA 
should be viewed with caution given the imbalanced distribution of treatment-non-naive vs. treatment-
naïve patients between White and Asian patients.  
In White and Asian patients, the most frequently reported AE by SOC was Infections and infestations, 
with rates of 197.99 per 100 PY (95% CI: 166.34, 233.92) and 160.53 per 100 PY (95% CI: 148.17, 
173.65), respectively.   
Most AEs resolved in White and Asian patients. Unresolved events were reported in 55 White patients 
(16.0%) and 14 Asian patients (22.2%).  
Given the low number of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment (fatal AEs only), or those 
that led to interruption of study treatment, no trend by race can be observed. 
In the All Patients with SMA pool, the overall rate per 100PY of AEs and Grade 1−3 AEs was similar 
between White and Asian patients.  The rates of Grade 4 and 5 AEs were approximately 3.3- and 5.6-
fold higher in Asian patients compared with White patients, respectively.  In patients with Type 2 and 3 
SMA, the rate of AEs per 100PY by Grade was similar or lower in Asian patients, Grade 4 events 
occurred only in White patients, and no Grade 5 event was reported.  In patients with Type 1 SMA, the 
differences in AE rates per 100PY between White and Asian patients were observed at all intensity 
Grades and were more pronounced at higher Grades, (1.4-, 2-, 1.8-, 2.4-, and 2.7-fold higher in Asian 
patients for Grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively).  The higher rate of Grade 4 and 5 events in Asian 
patients in the All patients with SMA population is driven by patients with Type 1 SMA.  The difference 
is more pronounced in the All patients with SMA pool compared to the Type 1 SMA pool due to a higher 
proportion of Type 1 SMA among Asian patients. The difference in Grade 4 and 5 AEs in patients with 
Type 1 SMA seems to be driven by the over-representation of older, treatment-non-naive Type 1 SMA 
patients among White patients compared to Asians.  
In the All Patients with SMA pool, the rate of AEs reported as related to risdiplam was approximately 
2.5-fold higher in Asian patients (38.74 per 100PY [95% CI: 25.53, 56.36]) compared with White 
patients (16.75 per 100PY [95% CI: 12.93, 21.35]).  This difference was driven mainly by patients in 
the Type 1 SMA pool.  In patients with Type 1 SMA, the rate of AEs reported as related to risdiplam 
was approximately 17.5-fold higher in Asian patients (61.95 per 100PY [95% CI: 32.98, 105.93) 
compared with White patients (3.53 per 100PY [95% CI: 0.43, 12.76]). In the patients with Type 2 
and 3 SMA, the rate of AEs reported as related to risdiplam was approximately 1.5-fold higher in Asian

[95% CI: 14.61, 24.32]).

In  the  All  Patients  with  SMA  pool,  the  rate  of  SAEs  per  100PY  for  the  overall  treatment  period  was 
approximately 1.5-fold higher among Asian patients (53.08, 95% CI: 37.38, 73.17) than among White 
patients (32.21, 95% CI: 26.81, 38.38), driven by patients with Type 1 SMA, where the rate of SAEs 
per  100  PY  was  approximately  1.5-fold  higher  in  Asian  patients  (104.83,  95%  CI:  65.70,  158.72)  as 
compared to White patients (74.17, 95% CI: 53.45, 100.25).  In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, rates 
were  comparable  between  Asian  patients  (30.79,  95%  CI:  17.23,  50.79)  and  White  patients  (25.04, 
95% CI: 19.95, 31.04).  SAEs generally resolved and did not lead to dose modifications.  
Overall, there are differences in age and imbalance in treatment-naïve vs. treatment non-naive 
patients in the different race groups (over-representation of older, treatment-non-naive Type 1 SMA 
patients among White patients compared to Asians). 
Safety in Treatment-Naïve vs. Treatment Non-Naïve Patients 
An  analysis  of  the  effect  of  prior  treatment  with  nusinersen  or  Zolgensma (AVXS-101)  on  the  safety 
profile of risdiplam was conducted.   
A total of 90 patients are included in the treatment-non-naive group (76 patients previously treated 
with nusinersen and 14 patients previously treated with Zolgensma (AVXS-101)).  The rate of AEs per 
100 PY was comparable between treatment-non-naïve patients in JEWELFISH and treatment-naïve 
patients with SMA who were treated with risdiplam in SUNFISH (Part 1 and Part 2) and FIREFISH (Part 
1 and Part 2).  Due to shorter median duration of treatment in treatment non-naïve patients compared 
with treatment-naïve patients (FIREFISH Part 1: 23.33 months [range: 0.6−34.6]; FIREFISH Part 2: 
15.24 months [range 1.6−20.1]; JEWELFISH: 3.02 months [range: 0.0−32.8]; SUNFISH Part 1: 996.0 
days [range: 287.0−1183.0 days]; SUNFISH Part 2: 540.0 days [range: 100.0−807.0]) the analysis 
focused on the 0−≤6 month treatment period, where exposure times are most comparable (Naïve: Type 
1: 29.8 PY, Type 2/3: 114.6 PY; Non-naïve: Type 1: 3.1 PY, Type 2/3: 22.1 PY). 
In All SMA Patient Population, the rate of AEs per 100 PY was comparable between treatment-non-
naïve patients in JEWELFISH and treatment-naïve patients with SMA who were treated with risdiplam 
in SUNFISH (Part 1 and Part 2) and FIREFISH (Part 1 and Part 2). The impact of previous treatment 
was noticeable in the Type 1 population where patients who had been on previous approved SMA 
therapies did not experience any Grade 4 or Grade 5 (fatal) events; however, due to the limited data 
in the non-naïve Type 1 population, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Patients with Type 1 SMA 
During the 0−≤6 month treatment period, a total of 13 patients with Type 1 SMA who were previously 
treated with nusinersen (n=9) or AVXS-101 (n=4) had a total of 3.1 patient-years at risk (nusinersen: 
2.8 PY, AVXS-101: 0.3 PY).  The rate of AEs in all patients with Type 1 SMA was comparable between 
the treatment non-naive and the treatment-naïve populations (treatment non-naive: 580.27 per 100 
PY [95% CI: 343.91, 917.08] vs. treatment-naïve: 681.17 per 100 PY [95% CI: 590.69, 781.60]). 
In both populations, the highest rates of AEs were in the Infections and infestations SOC.  At least 2 
AEs were reported in treatment non-naïve patients in the SOC Infections and Infestations and 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.  While the rates in the respiratory SOC were 
comparable, a numerically higher rate of infections was reported in the treatment non-naive patients 
(treatment non-naive: 354.61 per 100 PY [95% CI: 177.02, 634.50] vs. treatment-naïve: 187.91 per 
100 PY [95% CI: 141.95, 244.02]).  In both populations, infections were mostly affecting the 
respiratory tract and generally resolved with ongoing treatment with risdiplam. 
The rate of SAEs in all treatment non-naïve patients with Type 1 SMA during the 0−≤6 month treatment 
period was comparable between the treatment non-naive and the treatment-naïve populations 
(treatment non-naive: 193.42 per 100 PY [95% CI: 70.98, 421.00] vs. treatment-naïve: 130.87 per 
100 PY [95% CI: 93.06, 178.90]). SAEs were reported in more than one treatment non-naïve patient 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 253/293 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only in the SOC Infections and infestations.  In both populations the most common SAEs were in the 
Infections and infestations SOC driven by respiratory tract infections. 
The  intensity  of  AEs  reported  in  both  populations  was  reflective  of  the  previous  SMA  treatment,  with 
Grade 4 and 5 AEs reported only in treatment-naïve patients. 
Patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA 
During the 0−≤6 month treatment period, a total of 77 patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA who were 
previously treated with nusinersen (n=67) or AVXS-101 (n=10) had a total of 22.1 patient-years at risk 
(nusinersen: 20.4 PY, AVXS-101: 1.6 PY).  The rate of AEs overall was comparable in both populations 
(non-naïve: 932.82 per 100 PY [95% CI: 809.78, 1069.28] vs. treatment-naïve: 773.82 per 100 PY 
[95% CI: 723.73, 826.47]). 
AEs which occurred at the highest rates were in the SOC Infections and infestations (treatment non-
naïve: 271.70 per 100 PY [95% CI: 207.33, 349.73] vs. treatment-naïve: 215.48 per 100PY [95% CI: 
189.45, 244.10]), with upper respiratory tract infection being the most common preferred term in both 
groups, followed by Gastrointestinal disorders (172.07 per 100 PY [95% CI: 121.77, 236.19] vs. 
131.73 per 100 PY [95% CI: 111.56, 154.50]), and General disorders and administrative site 
conditions (104.15 per 100 PY [95% CI: 66.02, 156.28] vs. 61.94 per 100PY [95% CI: 48.38, 78.13]), 
with the most common AE being pyrexia in both groups. 
A higher rate of SAE was observed in non-naïve patients during the first 6 months of treatment (40.75 
vs. 22.68 per 100PY in naïve patients). However, this did not correspond to higher rates of specific 
AEs. The most common SAEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations where the rate of SAEs was 
similar between the two groups (non-naïve 13.58 vs. naïve 14.83 per 100 PY).  Other SOCs with 2 or 
more AEs in either population were: Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (non-naïve: 9.0 
vs. naïve: 0.87 per 100 PY); General disorders and administration site conditions and Renal and 
urinary disorder (0 vs. 1.74 per 100 PY for both). 
The rate of Grade 3 events was approximately 3-fold higher in treatment-non-naive patients.  No 
Grade 5 events were reported in either population in the entire treatment period and few patients had 
Grade 4 events in both populations.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no clinical data from the use of risdiplam in pregnant women. Risdiplam has been shown to 
be embryo-fetotoxic and teratogenic in animals.  Based on the findings from animal studies, risdiplam 
crosses the placental barrier and may cause foetal harm. 
Risdiplam should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the 
potential risks to the foetus. If a pregnant woman needs to be treated with risdiplam she should be 
clearly advised on the potential risk to the foetus. 
The safe use of risdiplam during labour and delivery has not been established.  
It is not known whether risdiplam is excreted in human breast milk. Studies in rats show that risdiplam 
is excreted into milk. It is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with risdiplam.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Risdiplam is primarily metabolised by flavin monooxygenase 1 and 3 (FMO1 and 3), and also by CYPs 
1A1, 2J2, 3A4, and 3A7.  Risdiplam is not a substrate of human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). 
Effects of Other Medicinal Products on Risdiplam 
Coadministration of 200 mg itraconazole twice daily, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with a single oral dose 
of 6 mg risdiplam did not exhibit a clinically relevant effect on the PK of risdiplam (11% increase in 
AUC,9% decrease in Cmax). No dose adjustments are required when risdiplam is co-administered with a 
CYP3A inhibitor.  
No drug-drug interactions are expected via the FMO1 and FMO3 pathway.  
Effects of Risdiplam on Other Medicinal Products 
In vitro risdiplam and its major circulating metabolite M1 did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
or 3A4. In vitro studies showed that risdiplam and M1 did not inhibit (reversible or time-dependent 
inhibition) any of the CYP enzymes tested (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6) with the exception of 
CYP3A. 
In healthy adult subjects, administration of risdiplam 8 mg once daily for 2 weeks slightly increased 
the exposure of the sensitive CYP3A substrate midazolam (AUC 11%; Cmax 16%). The extent of the 
interaction is not considered clinically relevant, and therefore no dose adjustment is required for CYP3A 
substrates.  Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling a similar magnitude of 
the effect is expected in children and infants as young as 2 months old. 
In vitro studies have shown that risdiplam and its major metabolite are not a significant inhibitor of 
human MDR1, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter 
1 and 3 (OAT 1 and 3) transporters. Risdiplam and its metabolite are however in vitro inhibitors of the 
human organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1 and 
MATE2-K transporters.  At therapeutic drug concentrations, no interaction is expected with OCT2 
substrates.  The clinical relevance of the coadministration with MATE1/2-K substrates is unknown. 
Overdose 
There is limited clinical trial experience in SMA with doses higher than the proposed dose of risdiplam.  
In the Patients with Type 1 SMA pool, 9 patients received doses more than 10% above the pivotal 
dose. Doses above the pivotal dose were administered for up to 79 consecutive days and were up to 
33% higher than the pivotal dose. AEs were reported in temporal association with overdoses in 4 
patients; these events were all reported as unrelated to study medication and were reflective of the 
underlying disease (atelectasis in one patient, kyphosis and scoliosis in one patient, pyrexia in one 
patient, and upper respiratory tract infection [SAE] and upper respiratory tract inflammation in one 
patient). All events resolved with the exception of kyphosis and scoliosis.  
In the Patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, 9 patients received doses more than 10% above the 
pivotal dose. Four patients with a dose above the pivotal dose for more than 1 day received a dose up 
to 30% higher than planned, for up to 65 consecutive days. Four patients received double the planned 
dose for a single day. No AEs were associated with these higher doses. 
Very low safety margins were seen for most toxicities observed in animal studies.  Risdiplam likely has 
a narrow therapeutic window. Clinical trial experience in SMA with doses higher than the proposed 
dose of risdiplam is very limited. There is no antidote.

Drug abuse potential 
AEs that may potentially be indicative of the abuse potential of risdiplam were defined using an 
Adverse Event Group Term (AEGT) MedDRA basket defined in accordance with the FDA guidance 
document “Assessment of Abuse Potential of Drugs (CDER)” January 2017 (CDER 2017). An evaluation 
of risdiplam’s abuse potential was performed using the predefined basket of AE MedDRA preferred 
terms applied to the SMA pool and to the non-integrated datasets - 12 Feb 2019”, MedDRA Version 
22.1. 
Adverse Events Indicative of Abuse Potential 
Table 67 
Two patients with Type 1 SMA (2.6%) experienced a total of 6 AEs, and 8 patients (2.1%) with Type 2 
and 3 SMA experienced a total of 8 AEs. The AEs were all unique occurrences in these patients despite 
ongoing treatment with risdiplam and were assessed as unrelated to study treatment, with the exception 
of 7 events in 4 patients:

- One patient had 4 AEs of crying which were all mild, unrelated and resolved without change to risdiplam 
therapy,  most  within  1-2  days  and  treatment  with  paracetamol.  The  same  patient  also  had  an  AE  of 
irritability (mild, unrelated and resolved). 
- One patient had an AE of mild apathy which was reported as related to risdiplam; the AE had an onset 
on Study Day 1 and resolved within 14 days without change of risdiplam therapy and without treatment 
for the AE. 
- Two AEs of mild dizziness in two patients which were reported as related to risdiplam; in both patients 
the AE resolved without change of study therapy and without treatment for the AE. 
One additional patient in the non-integrated dataset for the completed Phase 1 studies had a mild AE of 
dizziness after a single dose of risdiplam, which resolved the same day without therapy; a second patient 
in the non-integrated dataset (drug-drug interaction study BP41361) had a non-serious AE of euphoric 
mood on Study Day 3, 2 days after midazolam (2 mg, PO Days 1 and 15, QD) and on the first day of 
risdiplam  treatment  (risdiplam  (8  mg,  PO)  Days  3  to  16,  QD)  which  resolved  the  same  day  without 
therapy and did not recur despite continuation of the study medication. 
Overall, these events do not suggest a signal of an abuse potential of risdiplam. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
No information is available regarding withdrawal or rebound effects of risdiplam. 
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and to use machines have been performed. The 
pharmacological activity and AEs reported to date in clinical studies of healthy volunteers and SMA 
patients do not indicate such an effect is likely. 
Overall, 22 AEs potentially suggestive of effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment 
of mental ability were reported in 20 patients with SMA in the pooled dataset (t_ae_IMP_SMA) and 4 
AEs in 4 healthy volunteers from the non-integrated datasets for the completed healthy volunteer 
studies.

related to risdiplam. The patient also had a concurrent mild AE of unrelated weight increase, which was 
also unresolved at CCOD. Risdiplam was not changed as a result of these events. 
- One patient was reported with a non-serious mild event of visual impairment with a small reduction 
in visual acuity 0.5 diopters which remained unresolved 411 days after onset at the time of CCOD and 
was reported as unrelated to risdiplam. Risdiplam treatment was not changed as a result of this event. 
- One patient had a non-serious mild event of dizziness reported as related to risdiplam with onset on 
Study Day 15 and which was reported as resolved on Study Day 101. Treatment with risdiplam was 
not changed as a result of this event. 
- One patient had a non-serious mild event of dizziness reported as related to risdiplam with onset on 
Study Day 11 and which was reported as resolved on the same day. Treatment with risdiplam was not 
changed as a result of this event and the event did not recur. 
- Four AEs in 4 healthy volunteers of Phase 1 studies (non-integrated data) after a single dose of 
risdiplam: 2 AEs of sleep disorder and 1 AE of dizziness, all mild and resolved; 1 mild AE of bilateral 
vision blurred, due to worsening of pre-existing cataract in a 58-year-old Asian participant after a 
single dose of risdiplam, the event resolved after laser surgery and the events were unlikely related to 
risdiplam (see Study NP39625). 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
One patient with Type 1 SMA had an AE that led to discontinuation of study treatment.  This was a 
case of Grade 5 (fatal) respiratory tract infection viral, which was considered not related to risdiplam.   
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Modification or Interruption of Study Treatment 
Thirty-three patients had AEs that led to interruption of study treatment (3 SMA 1 and 30 SMA 2-3 type).  
3 Type 1 SMA patients had AEs leading to treatment interruption: 2 of these events were SAEs (Grade 
4 hypoxia and Grade 4 pneumonia, in Part 1 and in Part 2 of FIREFISH, respectively), 1 was a Grade 1 
pyrexia (in Part 2 of FIREFISH) which occurred after gastrostomy. All events resolved and were 
considered not related to study treatment. 
In the Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, there were 30 patients who experienced 46 AEs leading to interruption 
of study treatment; all events resolved and were considered unrelated to risdiplam except for 1 AE of 
diarrhoea.  
In particular, in SUNFISH Part 1 and Part 2, at the time of CCOD, no patients had withdrawn from 
study treatment due to an AE. In Part 1, there were 4 patients (2 aged 2-11 years and 2 aged 12-25 
years) reporting 8 AEs that led to modification (interruption) of study treatment and resolved: 
gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal infection, pneumonia, pain, pyrexia, abdominal pain upper, vomiting, 
chronic respiratory failure (1 patient each). In the double-blind, placebo-controlled Part 2, more 
patients in the risdiplam arm had AEs leading to dose interruption compared with placebo (6.7% vs. 
3.3%) with the rate of SAE leading to dose modification being similar between the two arms (3.3% 
each). The AEs were: gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, varicella, 
constipation, vomiting, physical deconditioning, pyrexia, traumatic shock, aspiration (for all, 1 in 
risdiplam group vs. none in placebo group). All AEs resolved and did not recur following risdiplam 
treatment re-initiation except for one case of pharyngitis recurrence which in any case resolved.   
All patients resumed study treatment , with the exception of two patients who had not restarted 
risdiplam by the time of CCOD.

Post marketing experience 
At the time of the MAA submission, risdiplam was not commercially available in any part of the world 
so no post-marketing data exist. In United States, FDA has recently approved risdiplam for the 
treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients 2 months of age and older.  
2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety 
The Safety data on risdiplam are based on: i) safety data available from the ongoing pivotal clinical 
studies FIREFISH (Study BP39056), a two-part, multicentre, single arm, open study (Part 1 and Part 2; 
n=62 patients with infantile-onset SMA (Type 1)), and SUNFISH (Study BP39055), a two-part, 
multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (Part 1 and Part 2; n=231 patients 
with later-onset SMA (Type 2 and 3)), as well as ii) from the ongoing supportive study JEWELFISH 
(Study BP39054) an open-label, non-comparative study on treatment-non-naïve SMA patients (n=174 
including 159 patients with later-onset SMA (Type 2 and 3) and 15 patients with infantile-onset SMA 
(Type 1)). The clinical cut-off date (CCOD) was November 2019 for FIREFISH and January 2020 for 
SUNFISH and JEWELFISH. As requested, an update of safety data has been provided. Data cut-off 
varied; apart from compassionate use and ongoing RAINBOWFISH, safety databases were updated. 
Overall, the requested updated review of the safety data at the most recent clinical cutoff dates did not 
indicate relevant differences compared with the safety data presented with the MAA at the previous 
clinical cutoff dates. 
All data were integrated and analysed in 3 pools: i) All patients with SMA; ii) Patients with Type 1 SMA 
(infantile-onset); iii) Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA (later-onset). Overall, 465 patients (77 with 
Type 1 SMA and 388 with Type 2 and 3 SMA) received at least one dose of risdiplam and are included 
in the safety population for the pooled analysis.  
Non-integrated safety data from 5 completed studies in healthy volunteers and from the double-blind 
placebo-controlled period of SUNFISH (Part 2) were also considered. 
An analysis on safety data in treatment-non-naïve versus treatment-naïve patients was presented, 
with a discussion on whether the inclusion of data of patients previously treated with other specific 
SMA therapies could be confounding for a reliable assessment of integrated safety data on risdiplam 
were provided. While the data is scarce, the safety of non-naïve patients does not seem to be different 
from naïve patients regarding TEAEs. Insufficient data precludes providing information about the 
interval between stopping a previous SMA treatment and starting on risdiplam. 
Overall, the sample size of the safety dataset is considered adequate given the prevalence of the disease. 
Advanced disease in both Type 1 (infantile onset) and Type 2 and 3 (later onset) SMA as well as adult 
type (Type 4) SMA have not been specifically studied in clinical trials. This discussion has previously 
been held on efficacy. Only limited safety data is available for patients below 2 months of age.  SMA 
type 4 patients do not have safety data available. 
Exposure 
The median duration of exposure to risdiplam was 12.68 months (range: 0.0–38.9), with an overall 
exposure of 521.4 PY. Type 1 SMA patients tended to have a longer median exposure compared with 
Type 2 and 3 SMA patients: 15.24 months (range 0.1-34.6) vs. 9.30 months (range 0.0-38.9) (overall 
exposure of 92.1 PY vs. 429.2 PY). In All patients with SMA, 34% of patients were treated for up to 6 
months, 14.8% received the treatment from 6 to 12 months, 18.3% from 12 to 18 months and 18 to 
24 months, and 14.6% for more than 24 months. The majority of Type 1 SMA patients (71.4%) had 
been treated for >12 months while most Type 2 and 3 SMA patients (63.4%) had been treated for >6 
months. Most cumulative safety data comes from the first 6 mths of exposure. The applicant provided 
assessment report

an analysis of AE over time in SUNFISH, FIREFISH and JEWELFISH studies. The overall rate of AEs was 
highest in the first 6-12 months period after exposure to risdiplam. There were no observed patterns of 
AEs that had not resolved by the respective study clinical CCODs (possible chronic AEs) and no new 
AEs that occurred following 24 months of treatment with risdiplam (possible delayed onset AEs). Given 
the above, the long-term safety profile of risdiplam is still uncertain. Long-term safety of risdiplam, 
including comprehensive ophthalmological monitoring, will be further characterised in open label 
extension phases of four ongoing clinical studies (BP39055, BP39056, BP39054, and BN40703) 
including over 460 patients (infants, children, teenagers, adults, early and late onset disease) for a 
period of up to 5 years of treatment with risdiplam. In addition, the applicant is currently negotiating 
to participate in existing registries in North America and Europe to further assess long-term efficacy 
and safety profile of risdiplam. 
The integrated analysis of AEs has been presented mainly in rates per 100PY in order to adjust for 
differences in exposure time between the SMA pools.  
In All SMA patients, the median duration of exposure to the pivotal dose (0.2 mg/kg for patients from 
2 months to <2 years old and 0.25 mg/kg for patients with body weight <20 kg or 5 mg for patients 
with body weight ≥20 kg for patients ≥2 years old) was approximately 12 months (11.98, range 0.0-
34.5; 480.9 PY). 
The demographic characteristics of the All SMA Patients population were overall consistent with those 
expected for a broad population of patients with Type 1-3 SMA. The median age was 10.8 years (range 
from 2 months to 60.9 years). Patients were predominantly White (73.8%; Type 1 SMA: 59.7%; Type 
2 and 3 SMA: 76.5%); 13.5% were Asian (Type 1 SMA: 23.4%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: 11.6%). Overall, 
77.2% of patients were enrolled at sites in European countries.  
Adverse events 
Overall, 393/465 (84.5%) patients treated with risdiplam had at least one AE. In the All SMA Patient 
Population pool, the AE rate was 577.50 per 100 PY (95% CI 557.06, 598.51) with comparable rates 
between the two Type 1 SMA and Type 2 and 3 SMA pools (577.37 and 577.53 per 100 PY; 93.5% vs. 
82.7%). 
The majority of AE were of Grade 1 or 2 (418.21 and 124.48 per 100 PY, respectively). Grade 3, 4, 
and 5 AEs were reported with rates of 26.47, 4.79, and 1.34 per 100 PY, respectively, with 2.5-fold to 
18.5-fold higher rates in the Type 1 SMA compared with the Type 2 and 3 SMA for Grade 3 and Grade 
4 AEs respectively (Grade 3: 49.92 vs. 21.43; Grade 4: 21.71 vs. 1.16); and in Grade 5 AEs a rate of 
7.60 vs. 0 per 100PY in Type 1 SMA compared to Type 2 and 3 SMA respectively. This could be 
expected given the more severe SMA phenotype.  
Overall, in All patients with SMA, the three SOCs with the highest rate of AEs by 100PY were Infections 
and Infestations (65.6%, at a rate of 178.37 AEs per 100PY), Gastrointestinal disorders (39.1%, 88.99 
per 100PY), and Nervous system disorders (17.4%, 67.13 per 100PY). A trend towards a higher rate of 
AEs was observed in Type 1 SMA patients compared with Type 2 and 3 SMA patients in the SOC 
Infections and Infestations (particularly driven by upper respiratory tract infection related AEs), 
General disorders and administration site conditions (particularly driven by pyrexia), Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and Skin and subcutaneous disorders. In Type 2 and 3 SMA 
patients, rates of AEs were higher in the SOCs Nervous system disorders and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (driven by pain in extremity, arthralgia, back pain, and headache) followed 
by the SOCs Injury, poisoning and procedural complications and Reproductive system and breast 
disorders.

The most common AEs reported at the highest rates per 100PY in the All patients with SMA were: 
headache (55.81), pyrexia (43.15), upper respiratory tract infection (41.62), and nasopharyngitis 
(27.81), vomiting (22.82), and cough (18.41). 
In patients with Type 1 SMA, among most commonly AEs reported at rates ≥10 per 100PY, there were 
pyrexia (40.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (41.6%), pneumonia (27.3%), vomiting (11.7%), 
nasopharyngitis (14.3%), constipation (15.6%), respiratory tract infection (10.4%), diarrhoea 
(13.0%), rhinitis (10.4%). Other frequently reported AEs (rate <10 per 100PY) were cough (7.8%) 
and gastroenteritis (3.9%). Among the AEs with a frequency of 2 patients or more there were: urinary 
tract infection, ear infection, lower respiratory tract infection, viral infection (5.2% each), respiratory 
failure (6.5%, 5 patients), rash (6.5%), eczema (5.2%), erythema (3.9%), rash maculo-papular 
(5.2%), dermatitis atopic (1.3%). Neutropenia occurred in 2 patients (2.6%). Rash and diarrhoea are 
already reported in the proposed Table of ADRs for Type 1 SMA in the SmPC section 4.8.  
The higher rate of pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections, in general, in Type 1 SMA patients 
compared to Type 2 and 3 SMA patients may be related to the higher severity of the disease observed 
with the Type 1 SMA phenotype. 
Overall, the results of FIREFISH (Study BP39056) (Part 1 and Part 2) in terms of common AEs showed 
consistent results with the integrated analysis. Given the lack of a control group in this study, it is not 
possible to draw definite conclusions on the actual drug relationship for most AEs occurring in Type 1 
SMA.  
In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, the most commonly reported AEs (>5% of frequency) were 
headache (16.5%), pyrexia (19.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.2%), nasopharyngitis 
(18.3%), vomiting (13.9%), cough (11.9%), diarrhoea (12.4%), nausea (7.7%), gastroenteritis 
(9.0%), pneumonia (6.7%), rash (6.4%), constipation (4.9%), respiratory tract infection (5.2%), and 
rhinitis (3.4%).  
Of note, headache and nausea were reported only in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients; this, although 
possibly related to the fact that infants (Type 1 SMA) do not easily detail AEs should be reflected in the 
SmPC.  
Urinary tract infections occurred with a <5% frequency (3.6%), pain in extremity (4.4%), arthralgia 
(3.9%), back pain (3.6%), dysmenorrhoea (2.8%).  
Overall, the results of SUNFISH in terms of common AEs showed consistent results with the integrated 
analysis. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled Part 2, AEs that occurred with a higher frequency in 
the risdiplam group compared with the placebo group were pyrexia (20.8% vs 16.7%), headache 
(20.0% vs. 16.7%), diarrhoea (16.7% vs. 8.3%). AE diarrhoea is already included in the proposed 
ADR Table for Type 2 and 3 SMA of the SmPC section 4.8. Pyrexia could be confounded by concurrent 
infections. However, pyrexia and headache were reported with a 4.1% and 3.3% higher frequency in 
patients treated with risdiplam compared with placebo and should be included in      the list of ADRs 
reported in the SmPC section 4.8. Following a review of all events of headache in patients treated with 
risdiplam, the applicant initially considered that the events were mild and did not deserve mentioning 
in SmPC. Although headaches are common in both the general population, as well as in patients with 
SMA, they do occur with treatment with risdiplam. As such, the applicant agreed to report frequency in 
section 4.8 of SmPC for later onset SMA (toddlers did not report headaches in early SMA).  
The applicant discussed as requested not only AEs per 100PtY but also the rate of AEs between 
risdiplam and placebo for SUNFISH and risdiplam and comparable databases for FIREFISH. Differences 
beyond 2% in frequency should be added to SmPC. Following a comprehensive review and thorough 
causality assessments of events selected as described below, the applicant has not identified any new 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 262/293 
 
 
 
 
 
risks requiring a warning under Section 4.4 of the SmPC or any new adverse drug reaction. However, 
the applicant proposes to include “diarrhoea” into the ADR table in Section 4.8 for both patient 
populations, in light of the magnitude of difference between treatment arms in the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled period of BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2 as well as the clinical relevance of diarrhoea in 
patients with limited mobility. The applicant also proposes to include “rash” into the ADR table in 
Section 4.8 for both patient populations in light of the magnitude of difference between treatment 
arms in the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2.  
Other AEs occurring with a higher frequency in risdiplam group compared with placebo were: 
pneumonia (8.3% vs. 6.7%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (4.2% vs. 1.7%), gastroenteritis 
viral (3.3% vs. 1.7%), urinary tract infection (4.2% vs. 0), cystitis (2.5% vs. 0), mouth ulceration 
(4.2% vs. 0), aphthous ulcer (2.5% vs. 0), rash (7.5% vs. 1.7%), eczema (4.2% vs. 1.7%), erythema  
and rash maculo-papular, (2.5% vs. 0), acne, dermatitis allergic, dry skin, rash erythematous (1.7% 
vs. 0), migraine (2.5% vs. 1.7%), contusion (3.3% vs. 0), fall and  joint dislocation (2.5% vs. 0), head 
injury, and ligament sprain (1.7% vs. 0), arthralgia (5.0% vs. 0), pain in extremity and scoliosis (3.3% 
vs. 1.7%), myalgia (2.5% vs. 0), activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (1.7% vs. 0), C-
reactive protein increased (1.7% vs. 0), decreased appetite, dysmenorrhea (1.7% vs. 0), seasonal 
allergy (3.3% vs. 1.7%). 
Some of the AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, such as rash maculo-papular, 
erythema, dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, rash erythematous are already included in the ADR Table for 
Type 2 and 3 SMA of the SmPC section 4.8 under the PT rash.   
In the double-blind placebo-controlled Part 2 of the SUNFISH study there was an imbalance in the 
frequency of pyrexia between risdiplam and placebo groups (20.8% [25 patients] versus 16.7% [10 
patients]), with a difference of 4.1%. In the open-label extension phase when placebo patients 
switched to risdiplam, this difference persisted (risdiplam 13.3% vs. placebo 10.0%). In most cases 
pyrexia was associated with infections, however not in all cases. . 
Arthralgia occurred with a relatively high frequency, in 5.0% of risdiplam patients versus none in the 
placebo group. Furthermore, during the open-label extension phase all patients originally assigned to 
placebo switched to risdiplam and more patients in the placebo arm compared with the risdiplam 
patients reported arthralgia (5.0% [n=3] vs. 1.7% [2]) at the clinical cutoff date of 30 September 
2020. 
Urinary tract infection, cystitis, mouth ulceration, aphthous ulcer, occurred only in the risdiplam arm 
versus none in the placebo group of SUNFISH Part 2 and the last two AEs were considered related to 
study treatment by the investigators. These four events should be included for later-onset SMA in the 
ADR table of section 4.8 of the SmPC with the corresponding frequency category. .  
Given all the above, the applicant agreed to add mouth ulcerations and aphthous ulcers, urinary tract 
infection (including cystitis), arthralgia and pyrexia (including hyperpyrexia) for both infantile- and later-
onset SMA, in the ADR table in Section 4.8 with the corresponding frequency category. 
The applicant also stated that alignment with FDA label has also been implemented whenever possible. 
The AE rate decreased over time despite the ongoing treatment with risdiplam in the 3 pools. 
Overall, the rate of discontinuation was low. Only 1 patient in the Type 1 SMA pool (Part 1 of 
FIREFISH) (versus none in the Type 2 and 3 pool) had an AE leading to study treatment 
discontinuation i.e, a Grade 5 (fatal) respiratory tract infection viral, which was considered not related 
to risdiplam. Regarding the AEs leading to treatment interruption, 3 Type 1 SMA patients (3.9%) had 2 
SAEs (Grade 4 hypoxia and Grade 4 pneumonia) and 1 Grade 1 pyrexia (which occurred after 
gastrostomy). All events resolved and were considered not related to study treatment. In the Type 2 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 263/293 
 
 
 
 
 
and 3 SMA pool, there were 30 patients (7.7%) who experienced 46 AEs leading to interruption of 
study treatment; all events resolved and were considered unrelated to risdiplam except for 1 AE of 
diarrhoea. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2, more patients in the risdiplam arm 
had AEs leading to dose interruption compared with placebo (6.7% vs. 3.3%). The AEs were: 
gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, varicella, constipation, vomiting, physical 
deconditioning, pyrexia, traumatic shock, aspiration (for all, 1 in risdiplam group vs. none in placebo 
group). All AEs resolved and did not recur following risdiplam treatment re-initiation except for one 
case of pharyngitis recurrence which in any case resolved.  
Treatment-related AEs 
The majority of AEs were reported as unrelated to study treatment. In the All SMA Patient Population, 
14% of patients had at least 1 treatment-related AE (11.7% in Type 1 SMA pool; 14.4% in Type 2 and 
3 SMA pool) with 3.3% of all AEs reported as related to study treatment with a rate of 19.18 per 100PY 
(95% CI 15.61. 23.33). These data were comparable between the two SMA patient populations. 
Overall, the most frequently reported related AE was diarrhoea (9 patients, 1.9%), followed by nausea 
(7, 1.5%), rash (5, 1.1%), and headache (5, 1.1%). The majority of AEs resolved despite ongoing 
treatment with risdiplam.  
The applicant included nausea upon request for revision, in the Table of ADRs of the SmPC section 4.8 
with the corresponding frequency category. Similar to headaches, nausea has not been reported in 
patients with infantile-onset SMA.. 
In Type 1 SMA patients, the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were rash maculo-
papular, skin discoloration, constipation, and neutropenia (2 patients, 2.6% each). One SAE was 
considered related to treatment (neutropenia).   
Half of the reported AEs of neutropenia were considered as related to risdiplam treatment and one of 
them was serious; neutropenia could be clinically relevant in terms of risk of infection, particularly in a 
population of patients like those with SMA. After a review of these cases, the applicant pointed out that 
all AEs of neutropenia resolved despite the ongoing treatment with risdiplam and hence are not 
suggestive of risdiplam-induced bone marrow toxicity. Furthermore, neutropenia was already present 
at screening in some of these cases or occurred concomitantly with conditions like infections which 
may have led to temporary decrease in the neutrophil count. The applicant reassured that 
haematological parameters and related AEs will be collected until patients complete the 5 years of 
treatment with risdiplam in the long-term open-label phase of all ongoing clinical studies. As a further 
reassurance, as requested, the applicant committed to monitor for and to provide detailed data on the 
occurrence of AEs of neutropenia and other haematological-related AEs also in the post-marketing 
setting. Therefore, the applicant committed to provide a thorough analysis of these data in the 
upcoming PSURs.  
In Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, the most frequently reported related AEs were diarrhoea (8 patients, 
2.1%), nausea (7 patients, 1.8%), rash (5 patients, 1.3%), and headache (5 patients, 1.3%). Other 
AEs considered as treatment-related were: aphthous ulcer and dry skin (3, 0.8% each), mouth 
ulceration, skin exfoliation, weight increased, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection (2, 0.5% 
each).  
As regard to the AEs of skin discoloration, investigators considered these events related to study 
treatment. Indeed, skin discoloration could develop in a certain part of the body due to difference in 
melanin levels, this could be plausibly related to the physicochemical properties and mechanism of 
action of risdiplam. The applicant has been requested to provide more detailed information on these 
events and elaborate on underlying potential causes. According to the applicant, since these AEs of 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 264/293 
 
 
 
 
 
skin discoloration resolved under risdiplam treatment and were reported from the same study site, a 
causal association is unlikely. However, the applicant has proposed to include “Effects on epithelial 
tissue” as important potential risk in the RMP. This was considered acceptable. As requested, the 
applicant committed to monitor for the occurrence of skin lesions such as exfoliation, dry skin, 
pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, Erythema, palmar erythema, hyperkeratosis, skin induration, skin 
lesion, eczema, dandruff, skin erosion, urticaria, dermatitis acneiform, skin discoloration, macule in the 
long-term open-label phase of all ongoing clinical studies (follow-up duration of 5 years) and in the 
post-marketing setting, and thorough analyses and detailed data will be provided in incoming PSURs.  
A late communication by the applicant on a quality defect on leakage from commercial product and the 
potential efficacy / safety consequences have been discussed particularly for the quality and related 
safety issues. The complaints were not associated with adverse events. The applicant stated that in 
clinical studies, there was no reports of accidental exposure and no indication in any report of adverse 
events coding to the System Organ Class Skin and Subcutaneous tissue disorders and Eye disorders. 
The applicant pointed out that since Evrysdi is administered orally oral mucosal contact is expected; 
oral mucosal events were generally single episodes and resolved despite continued oral dosing. The 
systemic exposure by transdermal absorption of small amounts of Evrysdi solution or powder during 
handling of leaking bottles has been estimated by the applicant to be low and thus negligible. It is 
substantially below the no observed adverse effect level established clearly and consistently in various 
toxicology studies, even if caregivers are in direct, repeated, and prolonged skin contact. Therefore, 
there should be no relevant risk associated with handling of leaking bottles. A microbiological risk has 
been deemed low by the applicant as the solution contains sodium benzoate, is stable for at least 64 
days of multi-dose usage and is administered orally. 
It could not be neglected that in some, although few cases, mild non-serious dizziness occurred with 
apparent causal relationship with the risdiplam treatment based on the investigator’s judgement. After 
a review of these cases, the applicant pointed out that none of these events was reported in the 
risdiplam arm during the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the SUNFISH study while 2 AEs were 
reported in 2 (3.3%) patients in the placebo arm. Of note, the AE of mild dizziness associated with 
nausea was reported in a healthy volunteer who received risdiplam and the event resolved the same 
day. As a further reassurance, as requested, the applicant committed to monitor for and to provide 
detailed data on the occurrence of AEs of dizziness/vertigo in the long-term open-label phase of all 
ongoing clinical studies (follow-up duration of 5 years) and in the post-marketing setting. Therefore, 
the applicant committed to provide a thorough analysis of these data in the incoming PSURs also to 
evaluate whether dizziness/vertigo should be mentioned in section 4.7 of the SmPC for driving or using 
machines.  
The results on the type of AEs considered related to treatment from SUNFISH (Study BP39055) were 
consistent with the results of the integrated safety analysis. In Part 2, during the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled period, the overall percentage of patients with at least one related AE was slightly 
higher in the risdiplam arm compared with the placebo arm (13.3% [16] vs. 10.0% [6]): mouth 
ulceration, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, headache (2 patients each, 1.7%), abdominal 
pain upper, dermatitis acneiform, eczema, rash, rash maculo-papular, skin discoloration, 
gastroenteritis viral, palpitations, cataract subcapsular, posterior capsule opacification, 
hypercholesterolemia (1 patient each). All AEs reported as related to study medication resolved 
without change to study medication with the exception of dry skin in 1 patient and 2 AEs of cataract in 
1 patient.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AESIs occurred only in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients. There were 2 events: 1 event of dyspnoea and 
tongue oedema on Day 480 that resolved and diagnosed as allergic reaction in a 23-year-old patient 
included in SUNFISH Part 1; 1 event of cyanosis (acrocyanosis) (described as blue discoloration of the 
distal limbs in the absence of pain, swelling or fever) and livedo reticularis, preceding days before by 
rash and pruritus generalised, occurred in a  46-year-old patient included in the JEWELFISH Study, 
previously enrolled in MOONFISH study (on the splicing modifier RO6885247). According to the 
applicant, this AE of livedo reticularis associated to acrocyanosis is secondary to vascular 
manifestations of SMA. It is acknowledged that literature data are supportive of this hypothesis. 
Indeed, the primary source of vascular perfusion abnormalities in SMA patients could be related to 
autonomic dysfunction. Vasculature defects and capillary bed depletion have been reported in patients 
with SMA and animal models; furthermore, microvascular injury has been reported in Type 2 and 3 
SMA patients; it has been reported that patients with SMA are more likely to develop vascular defects, 
such as such as peripheral vascular disease, chronic venous insufficiency, and chronic vascular 
insufficiency of the intestines, before any sign of neuromuscular disease. Therefore, the explanations 
for this event provided by the applicant have been considered biologically plausible. 
Effects on epithelial tissues 
The occurrence of AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders are of particular interest 
given the mechanism of action of risdiplam in terms of induction of alternative splicing of other off 
target genes and the nonclinical findings. 
In the All SMA Patient Population, 171 AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were 
reported in 110 patients (23.7%) at a rate of 32.80 per 100PY (95% CI: 28.07, 38.10) (Type 1 SMA: 
35.1% at a rate of 41.24 per 100PY; Type 2 and 3 SMA: 21.4% at a rate of 30.98 per 100PY). Of 
these, 3.9% were reported as treatment-related; all, except for 4 AEs in 2 patients (livedo reticularis, 
palmar erythema, erythema, and skin exfoliation, all occurring in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients) resolved 
despite the ongoing treatment with risdiplam. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 5.2% of patients with 
Type 1 SMA and 3.6% of patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA.   
14 patients (3.0%) (1 [1.3%] patient with Type 1 SMA and 13 [3.4%] patients with Type 2 and 3 
SMA) had at least 1 AE that had not resolved by the CCODs for this analysis; these were: 5 cases of 
acne and one case each of: dermatitis, dermatitis atopic, dry skin, dyshidrotic eczema, erythema, hair 
growth abnormal, hypertrichosis, livedo reticularis, palmar erythema, seborrhoeic dermatitis, skin 
disorder, skin exfoliation, skin odour abnormal. Unresolved skin events did not lead to a change in 
study medication and did not worsen despite ongoing treatment, with the exception of livedo 
reticularis. Overall, the rate of the AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders declined 
during the first 12 months and then stabilised.  
Although it is acknowledged that in a young population such as that affected by Type 1 and Type 2 and 
3 SMA, skin-related disorders can be frequent compared with older subjects, it should be considered 
that in the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2 there is a clear higher frequency 
(approximately 3-fold higher) of epithelial tissue-related AEs in patients receiving risdiplam compared 
with those receiving placebo (30.8% vs. 11.7%). AEs reported in more than 1 patient from this SOC in 
the risdiplam arm were rash (9 patients), eczema (5 patients), erythema (3 patients), rash maculo-
papular (3 patients) and (in 2 patients each) acne, dermatitis allergic, dry skin, and rash 
erythematous. In the placebo arm, all AEs were single occurrences. All events were mild to moderate 
in intensity and none of the events were reported as a SAE or led to a change in study medication. 
Events were mostly reported as unrelated to study medication with the exception of 6 events in 6 
patients in the risdiplam arm (dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, eczema, rash, rash maculo-papular and 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 266/293 
 
 
 
 
 
skin discoloration) and 1 event in one patient in the placebo arm (dermatitis herpetiformis). Events 
resolved in most patients with the exception of 7 patients in the risdiplam arm and 1 patient in the 
placebo arm. AEs which were unresolved at the CCOD are events expected to have a prolonged 
course: acne, dry skin, seborrheic dermatitis, dermatitis contact, dyshidrotic eczema, hair growth 
abnormal, pityriasis rosea, intertrigo (this last in the placebo arm), all reported as unrelated to study 
treatment.  
Some of these AEs are already included in the ADRs Table of the SmPC section 4.8 under the PT 
“rash”. However, other AEs, although occurring in only 1 or 2 patients in the risdiplam arm versus 
none in the placebo arm (particularly skin discoloration but also eczema, skin erosion, dry skin, 
dermatitis atopic, hair growth abnormal, pruritus, pityriasis rosea, etc.) can be suggestive of an effect 
of risdiplam on skin and epithelial tissues in general. As mentioned above, the applicant was asked to 
commit to monitor for the occurrence of these events and to provide detailed data in the upcoming 
PSURs. As mentioned above, the applicant agreed to comply with the requested commitments.   
Ophthalmology AEs 
The occurrence of AEs in the SOC Eye disorders and, in general, in the SOCs of Investigations or 
General disorders and administration site conditions, are of particular interest given the mechanism of 
action of risdiplam, its physicochemical properties, and the nonclinical ophthalmological findings of 
retinal toxicity.  For these reasons, a comprehensive panel of ophthalmological assessments was 
followed in the clinical development programme of risdiplam in SMA patients, including imaging to 
detect structural changes of the retina and visual function testing to detect potential functional 
impairment in central or peripheral vision. 
Overall,  90%  of  the  465  patients  included  in  the  integrated  safety  dataset  completed  the  SD-OCT 
assessment. 
In the All SMA Patient Population, 33 AEs in the SOC Eye disorders were reported in 29 (6.2%) patients.  
In Type 1 SMA patients, 6 AEs in 5 (6.5%) patients; all these events were mild, considered unrelated to 
study treatment, and resolved without change in risdiplam treatment, except for 2 AEs in 2 patients: 1 
AE of moderate strabismus; 1 AE of moderate heterophoria in both eyes.   
In Type 2 and 3 SMA, 27 AEs were reported in 24 (6.2%) patients; all events were mild, considered 
unrelated to study treatment and resolved without treatment changes except for 7 AEs reported in 6 
patients: moderate dry eye; moderate lacrimation increased; moderate eye allergy; moderate corneal 
infiltrates; macular cyst detected on SD-OCT assessment reported as related to study treatment but it 
was not confirmed at subsequent assessments; mild visual impairment unresolved at the CCOD with 
minimal decrease in sight (onset on Day 324) with no corresponding findings in other ophthalmologic 
tests, considered unrelated to risdiplam. Of note, 1 AE in the SOC Neoplasms (mild eye naevus with 
onset on Day 15) did not resolve either and was considered as non-related to study treatment that was 
not changed. 
In the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2, more patients in the placebo group had AEs in 
the SOC Eye disorders compared with risdiplam arm (10.0% vs. 6.7%). The AEs that occurred in at 
least 1 patient of the risdiplam group versus none in the placebo group were: cataract subcapsular, 
eye pruritus, eyelid disorder, ocular hyperaemia, posterior capsular opacification, vision blurred, visual 
impairment (1 each vs. 0). All events were reported as unrelated to study treatment and resolved 
except for 3 AEs in 2 patients: 1 mild AE of visual impairment considered unrelated to treatment in a 
patient that lost 0.5 dioptries in the absence of findings observed at OCT and with a subsequent BCVA 
improved compared to baseline; 2 mild events of cataract subcapsular and posterior capsule 
opacification both reported as related to treatment, but not confirmed at subsequent assessment made 
after CCOD.

Overall, these findings suggest that that there is no evident signal of retinal toxicity associated with 
risdiplam treatment from clinical data, in the absence of structural changes to the retina or relevant 
visual acuity or visual field impairment detected on neuroimaging assessment or visual function 
testing. However, it should be considered that the majority of patients (approximately half of patients, 
n=243) had an ophthalmological follow-up of at least 1 year, 72 completed a follow-up of at least 2 
years and only 12 of at least 3 years. In the setting of a chronic treatment like the treatment with 
risdiplam is, there is the possibility that events related to delayed retinal toxicity could be observed in 
a longer term and with a very low frequency that would need a longer exposure. Therefore, in the 
absence of long-term safety data, at the moment it is not completely and definitely known whether the 
non-clinical findings translate into an actual risk in humans. The applicant considered retinal toxicity 
observed in monkey as an important potential risk and put in place risk minimisation measures (SmPC 
section 5.3, preclinical safety data; effect on retinal structure) in the RMP as well as routine 
pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reaction reporting and signal detection (routine 
PSUR/PBRER reporting until completion of the open-label extension phases of the risdiplam studies 
where patients will continue to be monitored for ophthalmological findings). However, given the non-
completely known clinical relevance of nonclinical retinal toxicity findings in the long-term, in order to 
provide the prescriber with a complete information on risdiplam safety aspects, a specific warning in 
section 4.4 is being added:  
“Retinal toxicity 
“The  effects  of  Evrysdi  on  retinal  structure  observed  in  the  non-clinical  safety  studies  have  not  been 
observed  in  clinical  studies  with  SMA  patients.  However,  long-term  data  are  still  limited.  The  clinical 
relevance of these nonclinical findings in the long-term has therefore not been established (see section 
5.3).”. 
The applicant pointed out that in order to exclude any risk of retinal toxicity in the long-term, 
ophthalmological monitoring in clinical studies with risdiplam will continue until patients have 
completed 5 years of risdiplam treatment and that such data will be available before patients initiating 
treatment in the early post-marketing phase will be treated for longer durations. These data which are 
continuously reviewed will lead the applicant to submit any confirmed finding of risdiplam-induced 
retinal toxicity to the Health Authorities as an Emerging Safety Issue. These data will guide any future 
regulatory decision making for any subsequent labelling. If these data continue to show no evidence of 
retinal toxicity, the applicant proposes to remove the statements relative to retinal toxicity in Section 
4.4 of the SmPC. However, this will be evaluated only when these data will be available. As a further 
reassurance, the applicant was requested to commit to monitor for and to provide detailed data on the 
occurrence of AEs related to retinal toxicity also in the post-marketing setting. The applicant 
committed to provide a thorough analysis of the data from post-marketing evidence together with the 
5-year follow-up data from the studies, upon incoming PSURs.   
SAEs 
In All SMA Patient Population, a total of 103 patients (22.2%) reported 194 SAEs with a rate of 37.21 
SAEs per 100PY (95% CI 32.16, 42.83), most commonly observed in the SOC Infections and 
Infestations (21.10 per 100PY) and in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (6.14 per 
100PY).  
Of note, no SAEs were reported in the SOCs Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders or Eye disorders.  
The rate of SAEs was approximately 3.5-fold higher in patients with Type 1 SMA compared with 
patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA (54.5% vs. 15.7% at a rate of 93.33 vs. 25.16 SAEs per 100PY). This 
difference was mainly driven by the higher rate of SAEs in the Type 1 SMA patients compared with 
Type 2 and 3 SMA patients in the SOC of Infection and Infestations (42.9% vs. 10.3%) and 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (16.9% vs. 1.8%), and in particular by the AE 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 268/293 
 
 
 
 
 
pneumonia (23.4% vs. 4.4%). All SAEs pneumonia resolved except for two fatal cases in patients with 
Type 1 SMA. These observed differences between the two SMA patient populations are plausible 
considering the more severe disease phenotype in patients with Type 1 SMA who are more prone to 
develop respiratory complications and infections.  
All SAEs were considered unrelated to treatment, except for 1 SAE of neutropenia and 1 SAE of 
supraventricular tachycardia (in JEWELFISH study previously enrolled in Study WN29836 (Olesoxime)) 
that resolved without change to study treatment. 
SAEs resulting in dose interruption occurred in 15 patients; SAEs leading to a permanent treatment 
discontinuation were reported in 1 patient with Type 1 SMA (fatal SAE respiratory tract infection viral) 
and 1 patient had a SAE (decreased appetite) with no outcome reported as of the CCOD. 
All SAEs resolved with the exception of 1 SAE partial seizures in 1 patient in the Type 2 and 3 SMA 
group. Overall, in the integrated safety dataset, in All SMA Patient Population, the SAE rate was stable 
over the first 18 months of treatment (0-6 months: 42.47; 6-12 months: 40.15; 12-18 months: 37.58 
per 100PY).  
In Type 1 SMA besides the abovementioned infection- and respiratory SAEs, other frequent SAEs 
occurring in at least 1 patient were: dehydration, cardiac arrest, hypotonia (2.6% [2]), vomiting, 
decreased appetite, sinus tachycardia, hydrocephalus, neutropenia, cryptorchism, weight decreased 
(1.3% [1]). It is plausible that most of these SAEs reflect possible complications related to the 
underlying disease.  
In Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, a total of 61 patients (15.7%) reported 108 SAEs. Besides the 
abovementioned infection- and respiratory SAEs, other frequent SAEs occurring in at least 1 patient 
were: femur fracture, vomiting, pyrexia, (0.8% [3 patients]), gastritis, dehydration, (0.5% [2]), brain 
contusion, concussion, contusion, fall, femoral neck fracture, near drowning, tibia fracture, 
constipation, nausea, oesophagitis, decreased appetite, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, 
febrile convulsion, partial seizures, back pain, kyphoscoliosis, haematuria, hydronephrosis, 
nephrolithiasis (0.3% [1]).  
All SAEs resolved by CCOD except for 1 SAE i.e., partial seizures occurring during the open-label 
period of the SUNFISH Part 2. Updated information allowed the definite diagnosis of epilepsy confirmed 
by the investigator and as still ongoing, the patient is medicated with carbamazepine. The SAE is not 
related to risdiplam.   
The results on the SAEs from SUNFISH (Study BP39055) were consistent with the integrated safety 
analysis. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Part 2, 20.0% of patients receiving 
risdiplam (24/120) and 19.3% of those receiving placebo (11/60) experienced a total of 39 and 14 
SAEs, respectively (rate 32.72 vs. 23.29 per 100PY).  
Deaths 
At the time of CCOD for each study included in the integrated safety dataset, 6 deaths were reported 
during the treatment period, all occurred in Type 1 SMA patients due to SMA-related respiratory 
complications (viral respiratory tract infection, cardiac arrest and respiratory failure, respiratory tract 
infection, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia in 2 patients). One additional patient died 3.5 months 
after discontinuation from risdiplam therapy during the safety follow-up period due to acute airway 
obstruction from secretion/mucous plug which caused hypoxia and consequently cardiac arrest. None 
of these deaths were considered by the investigator as related to study treatment: the cause of death 
was classified as “progressive disease” in 6 out of 7 cases and as “adverse event” not related to the 
treatment (pneumonia) for 1 patient. All 6 patients had advanced disease at baseline.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology. In non-clinical studies, an effect of risdiplam in determining bone marrow depression 
with decreased cell counts across all 4 blood cell lines was found at exposure at least 4 times higher 
than the mean exposures observed in the clinical studies. This is due to the mechanism of action of 
risdiplam on alternative targets, the MADD and FOXM1 genes involved in cell division and apoptosis.  
In Type 1 SMA pool, a clinically relevant decline in cell lines was reported in 6 patients (the most relevant 
were 2 AEs of neutropenia and 1 of anaemia). In Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, a clinically relevant decline in 
cell  lines  was  reported  in  3  patients  (the  most  relevant  were  1  case  of  neutropenia  and  1  case  of 
anaemia).  
Overall, these findings suggest that that there is not an evident signal of relevant bone marrow toxicity 
from clinical data associated with risdiplam treatment.  
Liver enzymes. No Hy’s law cases were reported in patients with SMA. In the All SMA Patients 
population, the number of patients with shifts (to low or high values) in AST, ALT or total bilirubin was 
low, and did not increase over time. In Type 1 SMA patients, 5 patients had AST values >3x ULN at a 
single post-baseline visit. In Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, the highest abnormal high value was Grade 3 
(>5xULN) for ALT and below Grade 2 (<3xULN) for AST. AEs associated with liver enzymes occurred in 
4 patients. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of SUNFISH Part 2, 2 patients in each 
arm had ALT >3x ULN, one additional patient had ALT >3x ULN during the open-label treatment phase 
in the risdiplam arm. 
SMA patients may be more at risk of having transaminase elevations because deletion of SMN exon 7 
directed to liver leads to severe defect of liver development in mouse models. The applicant discussed 
the safety data from 474 patients treated for up to 43.1 months showed that risdiplam does not 
increase the risk of hepatocellular injury in SMA patients. It was highlighted that patients with SMA 
may be at increased risk for transaminase elevations based on the evidence of deleterious effects of 
SMN protein depletion on liver development in mouse models and evidence for abnormal fatty acid 
metabolism and liver steatosis in patients with SMA Type 1-3. For this reason, according to the 
applicant, the treatment with risdiplam may contribute to stabilizing liver function in SMA patients by 
increasing SMN protein levels also outside of the CNS. As a further reassurance, the applicant was 
asked to commit to monitor for and to provide detailed data on the occurrence of AEs related to 
hepatic injury in the open-label extension phase of all ongoing clinical studies (follow-up duration of 5-
year) and in the post-marketing setting. Therefore, the applicant was requested to provide a thorough 
analysis of these data in the upcoming PSURs. The applicant agreed to comply with the requested 
commitments. 
ECG parameters 
In the All SMA Patient Population, there were changes from baseline in ECG parameters, although in 
few patients. The percentage of patients with average QT, QTcB or QTcF above 450 ms, or change 
from baseline above 30 ms, was low and did not increase with time. No relevant differences were 
reported between risdiplam and placebo arms in the double-blind, controlled period of SUNFISH Part 2.   
Overall, 4 patients with Type 1 SMA had AEs during the treatment period reported in the SOC of 
Cardiac disorders and associated with clinically significant changes in ECG parameters (1 
bradyarrhythmia, 1 SAE of sinus tachycardia, 1 SAE of cardiac arrest, 1 fatal cardiac arrest).  
In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, a total of 13 AEs in the SOC Cardiac disorders associated with 
clinically significant changes in ECG parameters occurred in 10 patients. In particular, 1 patient had a 
SAE of moderate atrial fibrillation; 3 patients had a non-serious mild tachycardia; 1 patient in the 
risdiplam arm of the double-blind, placebo-controlled period, had average QRS prolongation at 93 
msec (NR 40-90 msec) (individual measures: 96, 93, 89) and was reported with a Grade 1 non-serious 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 270/293 
 
 
 
 
 
AE of bundle branch block which resolved. 1 patient in the risdiplam arm of the double-blind, placebo-
controlled period, had a T wave inversion on ECG; 1 patient in the risdiplam arm had a non-serious 
Grade 1 AE of atrio-ventricular block which resolved. Finally, 1 patient in the risdiplam arm had an ECG 
showing average PR interval at 162 msec (NR 80-160) with individual triplicate measurements of 156, 
182 and 147 msec). 
According to the applicant, based on the analysis of time-matched ECG and PK data obtained from 
studies BP29840, NP39625, BP39054 (JEWELFISH), and BP39056 (FIREFISH) Part 2, there is no 
evidence for an effect of risdiplam on the QTc interval. However, clarification on QTc analysis has been 
requested and concerns have been raised regarding the potential effect of the chronic treatment with 
risdiplam on QTc also after excluding in some patients (JEWELFISH) the confounding effect of 
previously administered anti-SMA treatment, in particular the one-shot gene therapy with 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) 
Analysis on QT exposure was performed with no evidence for a prolongation in QTc. Analysis on 
adverse event data was performed with description of all cardiac AEs in type 1 and type 2-3 SMA and 
significant ECG abnormalities reported, with new data regarding the new CCODs. No evidence that 
risdiplam has any effect on cardiac rhythm itself nor that it worsens any pre-existing, SMA related, 
cardiac rhythm abnormality was found.  
It is agreed, based on the current evidence, that there is no need to cardiac monitoring during 
treatment with risdiplam and no need to reflect cardiac AEs/QT prolongation in a separate paragraph of 
section 4.8 of the SmPC or as a warning in section 4.4.  
The applicant has added a planned tQT Study BP42817, a Phase I, double-blind, placebo- and positive-
controlled crossover study to investigate the effects of risdiplam on QTc interval in healthy subjects, as 
an additional pharmacovigilance activity. The study is included in Section III.3 “Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities”, as well as in Table 25 - Ongoing and Planned Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities. 
Tanner stage 
No patient with delayed puberty post baseline was observed, therefore, there is no evidence of an 
effect of risdiplam on sexual maturation as measured by the Tanner stage. 
Male germ cells 
Consistent observation of the effect of risdiplam on male germ cells in monkeys and rats, although, 
reversible, including similar findings for other small molecule SMN2 splice modifiers, suggest that this 
risk is a class effect and that it may translate to humans and could occur at the therapeutic exposures. 
The potential risk of adverse effects of risdiplam on human sperm as a consequence of its mechanism 
of action on secondary splice targets has not been characterised in clinical studies. Patients may reach 
reproductive age or some patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA may have already reached this age at the 
time of starting treatment with risdiplam. The applicant clarified that no data had been collected in 
humans and that it is not planned to collect these data in the future. After further discussion on male 
fertility impact of risdiplam, the applicant proposes to add information in sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the 
SmPC, providing a recommendation to avoid sperm cell donation and consider preservation strategies 
prior to treatment initiation or after a drug free period of at least 4 months. Furthermore, upon 
request, the applicant also added the following to section 4.4 Potential effects on male fertility: “The 
effects of Evrysdi on male fertility have not been investigated in humans”. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
A study using rasH2 transgenic mice with 6 months duration of treatment did not generate evidence 
for a tumorigenic potential. There is no evidence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity from the available 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 271/293 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical data at the CCOD. However, long-term non-clinical and clinical data on the carcinogenicity risk 
of risdiplam safety are still missing and this represents a concern since risdiplam is used to treat a 
severe, life threatening disease. In clinical studies patients with history of malignancy if not considered 
cured were excluded. Therefore, definite conclusions on the carcinogenicity potential of risdiplam in 
humans cannot be still drawn. However, and open-label extension studies will be followed patients up 
to 5 years. Furthermore, a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats has been started in September 2020 
and the final study report is expected by Q3 2023; this is reflected in the SmPC section 5.3 “Preclinical 
safety data”. In clinical studies patients with history of malignancy if not considered cured were 
excluded. Therefore, definite conclusions on the carcinogenicity and genotoxicity potential of risdiplam 
in humans cannot be still drawn. For these reasons, information in the SmPC will be updated as soon 
as an adequate evidence is produced. 
Suicidality 
There was no evidence for increased incidence of suicidal ideation or behaviours with time. 
Special population 
Age. The rate of AEs per 100PY was overall similar in the age groups <12 and >18 years (0-<2: 
580.90; 2-<12: 607.53; >18: 615.80) and lower in the 12-<18 age group (494.92). The highest rates 
of AE were in the SOC Infection and Infestations followed by Gastrointestinal disorders for all age 
groups, except for the ≥18 years age group where rates were higher in the SOC Nervous system 
disorders, mainly driven by AE headache, and the 0-<2 years age group where rates were highest in 
the Infections and infestations SOC. Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs were reported more frequently in 
patients <2 years of age compared with patients of the other age groups as well as deaths, which 
occurred only in this age group reflecting the severity of the underlying SMA phenotype. The 
percentages of treatment-related AEs were comparable between the different age groups with a trend 
towards higher rates in the 2-<12 and ≥18 years age groups (15.3% and 14.4%, respectively, vs. 
13.4% and 11.8% in the 0-<2 and 12-<18 years age groups, respectively). The rate per 100PY of 
related AEs was comparable across the younger age groups with a trend towards higher rates only in 
patients ≥18 years. 
Race. The differences in the distribution of AEs observed in White and Asian subgroups with an 
apparent worse safety profile in Asian patients (higher rates of Grade 4-5 AEs, treatment-related AEs 
and SAEs), should be interpreted with caution because they are likely due to differences in the 
proportion of Type 1 SMA patients that was higher in the Asian group (28.6% vs. 15.5% in the White 
patients) and in the proportion of Type 1 SMA non-treatment-naïve patients from JEWELFISH that were 
all non-Asian and the majority were ≥2 years of age, and thus likely to have a milder manifestation of 
the disease and fewer AEs overall due to older age compared to the Asian Type 1 population who are 
exclusively treatment-naïve and ≤7 months of age. In fact, overall, the rate of AEs was similar 
between Asian and White group, however there were differences based on the SMA Type: in patients 
with Type 1 SMA, the rate of AEs was higher in the Asian compared to the White group while in Type 2 
and 3 SMA patients the rate of AEs was higher in the White group.     
Safety in Treatment-Naïve vs. Treatment Non-Naïve Patients.  An analysis on the effect of prior 
treatment, like nusinersen (Spinraza) (n=76 patients) or AVXS-101 (Zolgensma) (n=14) on the safety 
profile of risdiplam was conducted and focused on the first 6-month treatment period when the 
exposure between naïve and non-naïve patients was overall comparable (Naïve: Type 1: 29.8 PY, Type 
2/3: 114.6 PY; Non naïve: Type 1: 3.1 PY, Type 2/3: 22.1 PY). In All SMA Patient Population, the rate 
of AEs per 100PY was comparable between treatment-non-naïve patients in JEWELFISH and treatment-
naïve patients with SMA who were treated with risdiplam in SUNFISH (Part 1 and Part 2) and FIREFISH 
(Part 1 and Part 2). The impact of previous treatment was noticeable in the Type 1 SMA population 
where patients who had been on previous approved SMA therapies did not experience any Grade 4 or 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 272/293 
 
 
 
 
 
Grade 5 (fatal) events, although a numerically higher rate of infections was reported in non-naïve 
patients compared with naïve patients. However, due to the limited data in the non-naïve Type 1 
population, these results should be interpreted with caution. In Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, the rate of 
Grade 3 events was approximately 3-fold higher in treatment-non-naive patients; a higher rate of SAE 
was observed in non-naïve patients during the first 6 months of treatment however, this did not 
correspond to higher rates of specific AEs. An analysis of the effect of race on AEs regarding 
treatment-naïve patients included in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) in Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, and 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) in Type 1 SMA patients. Overall, the safety profile was similar in both Asian 
and Non-Asian groups. 
Use in pregnancy. Risdiplam has been shown to be embryo-fetotoxic and teratogenic in animals.  
Risdiplam should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the 
potential risks to the foetus. If a pregnant woman needs to be treated with risdiplam she should be 
clearly advised on the potential risk to the foetus. 
Drug to drug interactions 
Based on in vitro investigations, co-administration with risdiplam may increase plasma concentrations 
of drugs that are substrates of the MATE1/2-K transporters. In all clinical studies with risdiplam, 
medications that are MATE1/2-K substrates were explicitly prohibited per protocol. Among prohibited 
medications in SMA clinical studies there were also medications with known phototoxicity and retinal 
toxicity liabilities. Upon request, the applicant agreed to add specific wording into Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC: “The potential for synergistic effects of concomitant administration of risdiplam with retinotoxic 
drugs has not been studied. Therefore, caution in using concomitant medications with known or 
suspected retinal toxicity is recommended”. The applicant requested not to include the term 
“phototoxicity” in this context, as this term generally refers to light-induced skin reactions. As such, it 
was considered acceptable to maintain only the overarching term “retinotoxicity”. Furthermore, the 
applicant pointed out that during the open-label extension phase of the ongoing clinical studies in SMA, 
retinotoxic medications are no longer prohibited and therefore, after the completion of this study, they 
will want to reassess the appropriateness of this wording in section 4.5 of the SmPC.

Overdose 
Very low safety margins were seen for most toxicities observed in animal studies.  Risdiplam likely has 
a narrow therapeutic window. Clinical trial experience in SMA with doses higher than the proposed 
dose of risdiplam is very limited. There is no antidote. 
Drug abuse potential 
Overall, available safety data do not suggest a signal of an abuse potential of risdiplam. 
Post-marketing data 
At the time of the MAA submission, the applicant stated that risdiplam was not presently commercially 
available in any part of the world so no post-marketing data exist. In United States, FDA has recently 
approved risdiplam for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients 2 months of age 
and older. 
2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, no major issues were found in the clinical assessment of the safety profile of risdiplam. 
However, taken together with efficacy assessment, there are some concerns raised by the safety 
profile of risdiplam remain, especially the long-term adverse events, but their relevance is being 
clarified in the open-label extension phase (with a 5-years follow-up) of all ongoing clinical studies and 
in the post-marketing setting and will be dealt with the appropriate risk minimisation measures. 
Regarding the communication on leakage from commercial product, further clarifications on the safety 
impact of this quality defect and further implementations of the PI were made as well as clarifications 
on the measures put in place to actively search for leaking bottles events and to actively monitor 
potential safety issues related to leaking bottles in the open-label extension phase of all ongoing 
clinical studies and in the post-marketing setting.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 07.08.2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9. Product information 
2.9.1. User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2. Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evrysdi (risdiplam) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed therapeutic indication was: 
“Treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)” 
The severity of spinal muscular atrophy is highly variable and SMA subtypes are defined by age at 
onset and the most advanced motor milestone achieved during development. 
SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder secondary to loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the 
survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene with subsequent loss of SMN protein expression. In humans, 
there are two SMN genes, the SMN1 gene and its paralog SMN2. Accordingly, patients with SMA 
lacking a functioning SMN1 gene are dependent on their SMN2 gene and SMA is the consequence of 
decreased, insufficient levels of functional SMN protein produced by the SMN2 gene. Children born with 
multiple copies of the SMN2 gene have milder phenotypes, further demonstrating that the 
pathophysiology of the disease is due to insufficient production of functional SMN protein.  
To date, 4 SMN2 copies have been reported causing disease across the whole SMA spectrum, including 
in patients with a more severe phenotype, the Type 1 albeit very rarely. According to the largest 
worldwide series of genetically confirmed SMA patients ever published to date (n=2834), the great 
majority of the 459 patients with 4 SMN2 copies had Types 2 or 3 SMA (11% and 82%%, 
respectively). 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 280/293 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical studies have involved patients with SMA types 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore, studied patients with 
known SMN2 copy number status, only patients with two to four copies have been studied. As such, 
the finally adopted indication is: 
“Evrysdi is indicated for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients 2 months of age 
and older, with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2 copies.”. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently two authorised disease specific agents for the treatment of SMA: Spinraza 
(nusinersen) and Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec). 
The intrathecally administered SMN2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen (Spinraza) is 
approved for the treatment of SMA in paediatric and adult patients. Onasemnogene abeparvovec 
(Zolgensma) is a one-time intravenously administered, gene replacement therapy that uses a non-
replicating adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) capsid to deliver a functional copy of the SMN gene by 
intravenous infusion; it is approved in the United States and Japan for paediatric patients with SMA <2 
years of age. In the European Union (EU), onasemnogene abeparvovec is approved conditionally for 
the treatment of patients up to 21 kg in weight with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 
gene and a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, or with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 
gene and up to 3 copies of the SMN2 gene. 
There remains a significant unmet clinical need for effective treatments for SMA patients because not 
all SMA patients respond, tolerate and have access to approved medications.  
A group of expert clinicians and scientists convened in 2020 to develop a treatment algorithm for SMA. 
The working group recommended immediate treatment for infants with 4 copies of SMN2 diagnosed 
with SMA via newborn screening (Glascock et al. 2020). The expert group recognised that early 
treatment could prevent possible long-term disease complications, reduce the costs related to 
morbidity management, and reduce parents’ anxiety and stress of waiting for the imminent onset of 
SMA disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) 
Study BP39056 (FIREFISH) is an ongoing open-label single-arm study in infants with genetically 
confirmed Type 1 SMA. The study inclusion criteria allowed the characterisation of the effects of 
risdiplam treatment in infantile-onset SMA type 1. The enrolment criteria selected infants with two 
SMN2 copies and early onset of SMA symptoms, ensuring only patients with symptoms and diagnosis 
of Type 1 SMA disease at baseline were recruited, warranting the most representative patient 
population for the assessment of risdiplam benefits in infants living with SMA. 
A comparator placebo group was not included in Study BP39056 (FIREFISH), given the rapid decline of 
the disease. At the time of study start there were no approved disease modifying therapies, which 
precluded an active comparator arm. Instead, the MAA has used a natural history source, with similar 
population, to define thresholds of achievement. 
The primary endpoint for Part 2 (sitting unassisted) can be objectively measured. Sitting without 
support is never achieved in untreated patients with Type 1 SMA, thus developing this motor milestone 
would clearly diverge from the natural disease course of infantile-onset SMA. 
Other relevant outcomes have been assessed, namely overall survival, for young infants diagnosed 
with infantile-onset SMA. In addition, the effect of risdiplam therapy was assessed in a combined 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 281/293 
 
 
 
 
 
endpoint: the survival rates of affected infants and survival without permanent ventilation (event-free 
survival), two severe complications of Type 1 SMA. Risdiplam efficacy was supported by assessments 
of further clinical outcomes, such as the maintenance of the swallowing function and the ability to feed 
orally, and further gains in motor milestones and motor function. 
The scales used in this trial to assess further motor milestone development (Hammersmith Infant 
Neurological Examination Module 2 [HINE-2]) and motor function development (Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders [CHOP-INTEND]) are the most widely used and 
well-known scales for the assessment of changes in Type 1 SMA in both clinical practice and clinical 
research, including clinical trials. 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) was designed to include a broad sample of patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, 
representative both in age and disability status of patients seen in clinical practice. Consequently, 
recruited patients had a wide range of disease duration at the time of enrolment, and experienced 
different degrees of SMA-related complications such as severe scoliosis, muscle weakness and joint 
contractures. A narrower study population focusing, for example, on young patients only would have 
allowed a more homogeneous and easier assessment of efficacy (as size and type of treatment effects 
may vary by age) and could lead to a higher chance for the study to be successful. On the other hand, 
however, the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) allowed characterisation 
of the effects of treatment with risdiplam on the most prevalent SMA patient population: children, 
teenagers and adults living with Type 2 and non-ambulant type 3 SMA. 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) enrolled adults up to 25 years of age. Patients with disease onset at 
adulthood (such as Type 4) were not included in this study. Type 4 SMA is a very rare type of the 
disease and enrollment of a sufficient number of patients would have been challenging to achieve in a 
timely manner. In addition, the majority of Type 4 patients are stronger and their disease progresses 
much more slowly as compared to other SMA types. Ambulant type 3 SMA patients were also excluded 
from the pivotal trial. 
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) Part 2 was designed based on two sets of data: a longitudinal, 
retrospective, natural history study of Type 2 and 3 SMA patients where the MFM was used to monitor 
disease progression (Vuillerot et al. 2013) and the data from the placebo control arm of Study 
WN29836 (a Phase II SMA study for a discontinued development compound, olesoxime), including 
Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 patients. Both sources of data helped to determine the treatment 
effect of Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) as they assessed a population of similar SMA type and age range. 
After consideration of all options, including the rare nature of the disease and limited patient pool 
available, Roche decided to power the trial for a 3-point difference leading to a trial size still feasible in 
the SMA population.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Reaching sitting status in SMA 1 or walking in SMA 2 and non-ambulant 3 are self-explanatory as 
benefits, as these describe developmental milestones that will be unachievable in these patients 
otherwise. However, sitting status is valid beyond 5 secs without help, which reduces external validity. 
The observed results in developing a milestone, improving motor function and event free survival in 
the treated patients with different SMA types are presented below: 
SMA 1: Proportion of patients sitting without support for at least 5 seconds (BSID-III) (90% CI): 
29.3% (17.8%, 43.1%) 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 282/293 
 
 
 
 
 
SMA 2&3: Change from baseline in MFM32 total score, LS means (SE) difference from placebo (95% 
CI): 1.55 (0.64) (0.30, 2.81), p-value 0.0156 
Proportion of patients reaching a milestone or improving a minimally significant endpoint may have 
different impact on QOL. 
SMA1: Proportion of motor milestone responders as assessed by the HINE-2 (90% CI): 78.0% (64.8%, 
88.0%) 
SMA 2&3: Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM32) (Proportion of patients with a change from baseline in 
MFM32 ≥3 at 12 months): Odds ratio for overall response (95% CI): 2.35 (1.01, 5.44); p-value: 
unadjusted p=0.0469; adjusted p=0.0469 
SMA 1: Percentage alive without permanent ventilation (90% CI) :85.4% (73.4%, 92.2%) 
(performance criterion from natural history expected to be 42%) 
There is consistency between effects in SMA 1 and SMA 2&3. 
In risdiplam studies enrolling later-onset SMA (Type 2 and 3), 44/405 (11%) of patients had 4 SMN2 
copies. This number represents 22/231 (10%) of patients seen in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) (both 
Parts 1 and 2) and 22/174 (13%) in Study BP39054 (JEWELFISH). These patients’ age ranged from 
2 24 years in Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) and 13 60 years in Study BP39054 (JEWELFISH).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
SMA 1 trial was not placebo controlled. SMA 2&3 patients were mostly non-ambulant most of the time; 
therefore, effect on ambulant children is not available. 
Only mild to moderately severe patients were included. Severely diseased patients were not included, 
and response in these patients (efficacy and safety) is not known. 
SMA type 4 patients were also excluded, thus not providing enough data to reliably assess the B/R 
ratio in this population. 
The relevance of sitting for ≥5 seconds without support is of less relevance than sitting without support 
for ≥30 seconds at 12 months (7/41, 17.1%).  
The results with risdiplam have been contextualised with the results in other SMA directed treatments. 
The need to include or exclude from the indication patients that previously received treatment with 
Zolgensma, also in light of updated data from the JEWELFISH study, needs further discussion. 
Benefit of treatment on respiratory status of Type 2 or 3 SMA patients has not been demonstrated. 
In later-onset SMA, even though the difference from PBO on the primary endpoint (MFM-32) in 
SUNFISH trial Part 2 was statistically significant, the absolute difference from PBO was relatively 
modest (1.6-point difference on a 100-point scale) and no statistically significant difference from PBO 
was observed in the secondary endpoints HFMSE. The modest effects observed may be due to the 
short study duration (12 months) and to the heterogeneity of the patient population enrolled in the 
trial.  
The absence of significant differences from PBO observed on the secondary endpoint Hammersmith 
Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) are likely a consequence of the low motor function scores at 
baseline. Subgroup analyses according to disease severity defined as HFMSE total score ≥ 10 or < 10 
at baseline, for the HFMSE, MFM-32 and RULM endpoints (mean change from baseline and responders 
analysis) at 12 months and at 24 months have been provided, which support robustness of data. 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 283/293 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant argues that for the patient population enrolled in SUNFISH Study Part 2, that includes 
older patients with progressed disease, functional stabilisation (≥0 change from baseline in MFM-32) is 
an important treatment benefit. However, in Part 2 of the SUNFISH trial, according to clinician’s 
impression of a patient’s change in global health from baseline (CGI-C), a similar proportion of patients 
global health either improved or did not change from baseline in the risdiplam arm (85.8%) compared 
to the placebo arm (83.3%) at Month 12 . 
Given the limitations of the available data described above, more comprehensive long term data are 
needed to assess whether treatment with risdiplam significantly changes the natural history of the 
disease in later onset SMA (Type 2 and Type 3), and characterise the effect in pre-symptomatic 
patients and pts with 4 SMN2 copies. A PAES study is being implemented to respond to these pending 
questions. 
The proposed PAES objectives (outcomes in treated pre-symptomatic stage pts, pts with 4 SMN2 
copies and long-term maintenance of efficacy and safety in SMA pts) will respond to the impending 
issues. The outcomes, however, should be compared to similar condition patients who have not been 
treated with risdiplam (natural history patients). The population (including both risdiplam treated and 
non-treated patients) should ideally come from the same registries, to decrease the risk of biases 
resulting from different study populations and different epochs. This aspect is especially relevant for 
the assessment of B/R in patients with 4 SMN2 copies: longitudinal data for both treated and non-
treated patients must be available at the end of the study in this population. Status reports are 
expected annually, independently from the planned interim analysis. These status reports will allow 
assessment of ongoing recruitment and follow-up attrition, to confirm feasibility within the proposed 
timeframe, and to implement recruitment strategies if needed.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, 84.5% of patients treated with risdiplam had at least one AE with comparable rates between 
the two SMA patient populations (Type 1 SMA 93.5% vs. 82.7%). Grade 3 and 4 AEs were reported 
with 2.5-fold and 18.5-fold higher rates in the Type 1 SMA group compared with the Type 2 and 3 SMA 
group respectively. Consistently, Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs were reported more frequently in patients 
<2 years of age compared with patients of the other age groups as well as deaths, which occurred only 
in this age group, as it could be generally expected given the more severe SMA phenotype. Overall, 
the requested updated review of the safety data at the most recent clinical cutoff dates did not indicate 
relevant differences compared with the safety data presented with the MAA at the previous clinical 
cutoff dates. 
A trend towards a higher rate of AEs was observed in Type 1 SMA patients compared with Type 2 and 
3 SMA patients in the SOC Infections and Infestations (particularly driven by upper respiratory tract 
infection related AEs), General disorders and administration site conditions (particularly driven by 
pyrexia), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and Skin and subcutaneous disorders. In 
Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, rates of AEs were higher in the SOCs Nervous system disorders and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (driven by pain in extremity, arthralgia, back pain, and 
headache) followed by the SOCs Injury, poisoning and procedural complications and Reproductive 
system and breast disorders. 
In the whole SMA Patient Population, the rate of AEs per 100PY was comparable between treatment-
non-naïve patients in JEWELFISH and treatment-naïve patients with SMA who were treated with 
risdiplam in SUNFISH (Part 1 and Part 2) and FIREFISH (Part 1 and Part 2). The impact of previous 
treatment was noticeable in the Type 1 SMA population where patients who had been on previous 
approved SMA therapies did not experience any Grade 4 or Grade 5 (fatal) events, although a 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 284/293 
 
 
 
 
 
numerically higher rate of infections was reported in non-naïve patients compared with naïve patients. 
However, due to the limited data in the non-naïve Type 1 population, these results should be 
interpreted with caution, and no recommendations can be made. In Type 2 and 3 SMA patients, the 
rate of Grade 3 events was approximately 3-fold higher in treatment-non-naive patients; a higher rate 
of SAE was observed in non-naïve patients during the first 6 months of treatment however, this did not 
correspond to higher rates of specific AEs. 
The most common AEs reported at the highest rates per 100PY in the All patients with SMA were: 
headache (55.81), pyrexia (43.15), upper respiratory tract infection (41.62), and nasopharyngitis 
(27.81), vomiting (22.82), and cough (18.41). The higher rate of pneumonia and upper respiratory 
tract infections, in general, in Type 1 SMA patients compared to Type 2 and 3 SMA patients may be 
related to the higher severity of the disease observed with the Type 1 SMA phenotype. 
In patients with Type 1 SMA, the most commonly reported AEs were pyrexia (40.3%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (41.6%), pneumonia (27.3%), vomiting (11.7%), nasopharyngitis (14.3%), 
constipation (15.6%), respiratory tract infection (10.4%), diarrhoea (13.0%), rhinitis (10.4%).  
In patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA, the most commonly reported AEs (>5% of frequency) were 
headache (16.5%), pyrexia (19.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.2%), nasopharyngitis 
(18.3%), vomiting (13.9%), cough (11.9%), diarrhoea (12.4%), nausea (7.7%), gastroenteritis 
(9.0%), pneumonia (6.7%), rash (6.4%), constipation (4.9%), respiratory tract infection (5.2%), and 
rhinitis (3.4%). In the double-blind, placebo-controlled Part 2, AEs that occurred with a higher 
frequency in the risdiplam group compared with the placebo group were pyrexia (20.8% vs 16.7%), 
headache (20.0% vs. 16.7%), diarrhoea (16.7% vs. 8.3%). 
Rash and all AEs included in the proposed SmPC section 4.8 under the PT rash (rash maculo-papular, 
erythema, dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, rash popular, folliculitis) occurred in both SMA patient 
populations with a frequency >10%.  
The most frequently reported treatment-related AE in All SMA patients was diarrhoea (9 patients, 
1.9%), followed by nausea (7, 1.5%), rash (5, 1.1%), and headache (5, 1.1%). In Type 1 SMA 
patients: rash maculo-papular, skin discoloration, constipation, and neutropenia (2 patients, 2.6% 
each); One SAE was considered related to treatment (neutropenia). In Type 2 and 3 patients: 
diarrhoea (8 patients, 2.1%), nausea (7 patients, 1.8%), rash (5 patients, 1.3%), and headache (5 
patients, 1.3%). Other AEs considered as treatment-related were: aphthous ulcer and dry skin (3, 
0.8% each), mouth ulceration, skin exfoliation, weight increased, dizziness, upper respiratory tract 
infection (2, 0.5% each).    
It could not be neglected that in some, although few cases, mild non-serious dizziness occurred with 
apparent causal relationship with the risdiplam treatment based on the investigator’s judgement. After 
a review of these cases, the applicant pointed out that none of these events was reported in the 
risdiplam arm during the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the SUNFISH study while 2 AEs were 
reported in 2 (3.3%) patients in the placebo arm. Of note, the AE of mild dizziness associated with 
nausea was reported in a healthy volunteer who received risdiplam and the event resolved the same 
day. As a further reassurance, as requested, the applicant committed to monitor for and to provide 
detailed data on the occurrence of AEs of dizziness/vertigo in the long-term open-label phase of all 
ongoing clinical studies (follow-up duration of 5 years) and in the post-marketing setting. Therefore, 
the applicant committed to provide a thorough analysis of these data in the incoming PSURs also to 
evaluate whether dizziness/vertigo should be mentioned in section 4.7 of the SmPC for driving or using 
machines.

In the SUNFISH Part 2, during the double-blind, placebo-controlled period, the overall percentage of 
patients with at least one related AE was slightly higher in the risdiplam arm compared with the 
placebo arm (13.3% [16] vs. 10.0% [6]): mouth ulceration, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache (2 patients each, 1.7%), abdominal pain upper, dermatitis acneiform, eczema, rash, rash 
maculo-papular, skin discoloration, gastroenteritis viral, palpitations, cataract subcapsular, posterior 
capsule opacification, hypercholesterolemia (1 patient each). 
In order to provide the prescriber with a complete information on the risdiplam safety, the following 
AEs reported with a relative higher frequency, considered related to the treatment by investigators, or 
related to the mechanism of action of risdiplam, have been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
headaches, mouth ulcerations and aphthous ulcers, urinary tract infections including cystitis, 
arthralgia, pyrexia (including hyperpyrexia), and nausea.  
The occurrence of AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Eye disorders, the effects 
on bone marrow, male germ cells, and on heart are of particular interest given i) the physicochemical 
properties of risdiplam and its mechanism of action of risdiplam in terms of induction of alternative 
splicing of other off target genes and the nonclinical findings; ii) the relationship between some of 
these AEs and risdiplam treatment; iii) the fact that some of these AEs did not resolve with the 
ongoing risdiplam treatment; iv) the very low safety margin and, hence the likely narrow therapeutic 
window, of risdiplam, iv) the chronic treatment with risdiplam, and v) the potential low frequency of 
these AEs probably non-adequately detected due to the relatively low exposure to risdiplam in the 
current safety dataset. 
In the All SMA Patient Population, AEs in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were 
reported in 23.7% of patients (Type 1 SMA: 35.1%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: 21.4%). Of these, 3.9% were 
reported as treatment related. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2 there is a clear 
higher frequency (approximately 3-fold higher) of epithelial tissue-related AEs in patients receiving 
risdiplam compared with those receiving placebo (30.8% vs. 11.7%). Besides rash and correlated 
terms, other AEs were observed, although in only 1 or 2 patients in the risdiplam arm versus none in 
the placebo arm (particularly skin discoloration but also skin exfoliation, dry skin, pruritus, 
photosensitivity reaction, erythema, palmar erythema, hyperkeratosis [which is a skin/epithelial tissue-
related event similar to those reported in non-clinical studies], skin induration, skin lesion, eczema, 
dandruff, skin erosion, urticaria, dermatitis acneiform, skin discoloration, macule), which can be 
suggestive of an effect of risdiplam on skin and epithelial tissues in general. The applicant has 
proposed to include “Effects on epithelial tissue” as important potential risk in the RMP which has been 
accepted. The applicant agreed to comply with the requested commitment to monitor of to provide 
detailed data on the occurrence of skin/epithelial tissue-related AEs other than those under the PT 
“rash” (already reported in the ADR Table of the SmPC section 4.8) in the long-term open-label phase 
of all ongoing clinical studies (follow-up duration of 5 years) and in the post-marketing setting. 
Therefore, a thorough analysis of these data in the upcoming PSURs will be provided.  
Retinal degeneration has been observed in non-human primates. Concerning ophthalmology AEs, in 
the All SMA Patient Population, events in the SOC Eye disorders were reported in 29 (6.2%) patients 
(Type 1 SMA: 6.5%; Type 2 and 3 SMA: 6.2%). All events were mild, considered unrelated to study 
treatment. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled SUNFISH Part 2, more patients in the placebo group 
had AEs in the SOC Eye disorders compared with risdiplam arm (10.0% vs. 6.7%). There is no evident 
signal of retinal toxicity associated with risdiplam treatment from clinical data, in the absence of 
structural changes to the retina or relevant visual acuity or visual field impairment detected on 
neuroimaging assessment or visual function testing. However, still, OCT and ophthalmological 
examination at very low ages may be problematic. Furthermore, it should be considered that the 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 286/293 
 
 
 
 
 
majority of patients (approximately half of patients, n=243) had an ophthalmological follow-up of at 
least 1 year. 72 completed a follow-up of at least 2 years and only 12 of at least 3 years. In the setting 
of a chronic treatment like the treatment with risdiplam is, there is the possibility that events related 
to delayed retinal toxicity could be observed in a longer term and with a very low frequency that would 
need a longer exposure. Therefore, in the absence of long-term safety data, at the moment it is not 
completely and definitely known whether the non-clinical findings translate into an actual risk in 
humans. The applicant considered retinal toxicity observed in monkey as an important potential risk 
and put in place risk minimisation measures (SmPC section 5.3, preclinical safety data in the RMP as 
well as routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reaction reporting and signal detection 
(routine PSUR/PBRER reporting until completion of the open-label extension phases of the risdiplam 
studies where patients will continue to be monitored for ophthalmological findings). A warning has 
been added to section 4.4 of the SmPC that long-term data are still limited and the clinical relevance of 
these nonclinical findings in the long-term has therefore not been established. The applicant agreed to 
comply with the requested commitments to monitor for and to provide detailed data on the occurrence 
of AEs related to retinal toxicity in the post-marketing setting.  
Consistent observation of the effect of risdiplam on male germ cells in monkeys and rats, although, 
reversible, including similar findings for other small molecule SMN2 splice modifiers, suggest that this 
risk is a class effect and that it may translate to humans and could occur at the therapeutic exposures. 
The potential risk of adverse effects of risdiplam on human sperm as a consequence of its mechanism 
of action on secondary splice targets has not been characterised in clinical studies. This represents a 
concern since patients may reach reproductive age or some patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA may have 
already reached this age at the time of starting treatment with risdiplam. The applicant clarified that 
no data had been collected in humans and that it is not planned to collect these data in the future. 
After further discussion on male fertility impact of risdiplam, the applicant has added information in 
sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC, providing a recommendation to avoid sperm cell donation and 
consider preservation strategies prior to treatment initiation or after a drug free period of at least 4 
months.  
Overall, the number of patients with shifts in blood cell lines was low and did not increase over time. In 
Type 1 SMA pool, a clinically relevant decline in blood cell lines was reported in 6 patients (the most 
relevant were 2 AEs of neutropenia and 1 of anaemia). In Type 2 and 3 SMA pool, a clinically relevant 
decline in cell lines was reported in 3 patients (the most relevant were 1 case of neutropenia and 1 
case of anaemia). Overall, clinical findings suggest that there is not an evident signal of relevant bone 
marrow toxicity associated with risdiplam treatment. However, 2 AEs of neutropenia were reported to 
be related to risdiplam treatment, one of them as SAE. Furthermore, neutropenia was already present 
at screening in some of these cases or occurred concomitantly with conditions like infections which 
may have led to temporary decrease in the neutrophil count. However, in the setting of a chronic 
treatment like the treatment with risdiplam is, with very low safety margins, and hence a likely narrow 
therapeutic window, there could be the possibility that events related to bone marrow toxicity could be 
observed in a longer term and with a very low frequency that would just need a longer exposure. 
Furthermore, neutropenia could be clinically relevant in terms of risk of infection, particularly in a 
population of patients like those with SMA. Therefore, in the absence of long-term safety data, at the 
moment it is not completely and definitely known whether the non-clinical findings translate into an 
actual risk in humans. Haematological parameters and related AEs will be collected until patients 
complete the 5 years of treatment with risdiplam in the long-term open-label phase of all ongoing 
clinical studies. The applicant agreed to comply with the requested commitments to monitor for and to 
provide detailed data on the occurrence of AEs of neutropenia and other haematological-related AEs 
assessment report

also in the post-marketing setting. Therefore, a thorough analysis of these data in the upcoming PSURs 
will be provided.  
Cardiac and rhythm AEs have also been identified. Indeed, in the All SMA Patient Population, there 
were changes from baseline in ECG parameters, although in few patients. The percentage of patients 
with average QT, QTcB or QTcF above 450 ms, or change from baseline above 30 ms, was low and did 
not increase with time. No relevant differences were reported between risdiplam and placebo arms in 
the double-blind, controlled period of SUNFISH Part 2.   The applicant has added a planned tQT Study 
BP42817, a Phase I, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study to investigate the 
effects of risdiplam on QTc interval in healthy subjects, as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
The study is included in Section III.3 “Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities”, as well as in Table 25 - 
Ongoing and Planned Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities. 
SAEs occurred in 22.2% of the All SMA Patient Population. The rate of SAEs was approximately 3.5-fold 
higher in patients with Type 1 SMA compared with patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA (54.5% vs. 
15.7%). This difference was mainly driven by the higher rate of SAEs in the Type 1 SMA patients 
compared with Type 2 and 3 SMA patients in the SOC of Infection and Infestations (42.9% vs. 10.3%) 
and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (16.9% vs. 1.8%), and in particular by the AE 
pneumonia (23.4% vs. 4.4%). All SAEs pneumonia resolved except for two fatal cases in patients with 
Type 1 SMA. These observed differences between the two SMA patient populations are plausible 
considering the more severe disease phenotype in patients with Type 1 SMA who are more prone to 
develop respiratory complications and infections. All SAEs were considered unrelated to treatment, 
except for 1 SAE of neutropenia e 1 SAE of supraventricular tachycardia. 
Six deaths were reported, all occurred in Type 1 SMA patients due to SMA-related respiratory 
complications. One additional patient died 3.5 months after discontinuation from risdiplam therapy 
during the safety follow-up period due to acute airway obstruction from secretion/mucous plug which 
caused hypoxia and consequently cardiac arrest. None of these deaths were considered by the 
investigator as related to study treatment: the cause of death was classified as “progressive disease” 
in 6 out of 7 cases and as “adverse event” in the remaining case. Overall data do not show a higher 
risk of death associated to risdiplam treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Patients with advanced disease in both Type 1 (infantile onset) and Type 2 and 3 (later onset) SMA, 
and hence the very severe population, as well as adult type (Type 4) SMA have not been specifically 
studied in clinical trials. This discussion has previously been held on efficacy. Only limited safety data is 
available for patients below 2 months of age.  SMA type 4 patients have not been included in clinical 
studies. 
     The median duration of exposure to risdiplam was 12.68 months (range: 0.0–38.9), with an overall 
exposure of 521.4 PY. Type 1 SMA patients tended to have a longer median exposure compared with 
Type 2 and 3 SMA patients: 15.24 months (range 0.1-34.6) vs. 9.30 months (range 0.0-38.9) (overall 
exposure of 92.1 PY vs. 429.2 PY). Given the above, the long-term safety profile of risdiplam is still 
uncertain because data are scarce in both SMA 1 and 2 and 3. Strategies to collect long-term safety 
data on risdiplam have been discussed and will be added to the PAES. A study using rasH2 transgenic 
mice with 6 months duration of treatment did not generate evidence for a tumorigenic potential. There 
is no evidence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity from the available clinical data at the CCOD. 
However, long-term non-clinical and clinical data on the carcinogenicity risk of risdiplam are still 
missing and this represents a concern since risdiplam is used to treat a severe, life threatening 
disease. In clinical studies patients with a history of malignancy if not considered cured were excluded. 
Therefore, definite conclusions on the carcinogenicity potential of risdiplam in humans cannot be still 
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 288/293 
 
 
 
 
 
drawn. However, open-label extension studies will be followed patients up to 5 years. Furthermore, a 
2-year carcinogenicity study in rats has been started in September 2020 and the final study report is 
expected by Q3 2023; this needs to be reflected in the SmPC section 5.3 “Preclinical safety data”. 
Information in the SmPC will be updated as soon as adequate evidence is produced. 
SMA patients may be more at risk of having transaminase elevations because deletion of SMN exon 7 
directed to liver leads to severe defect of liver development in mouse models. As requested, the 
applicant discussed the safety data from 474 patients treated for up to 43.1 months showing that 
risdiplam does not increase the risk of hepatocellular injury in SMA patients. It was highlighted that 
patients with SMA may be at increased risk for transaminase elevations based on the evidence of 
deleterious effects of SMN protein depletion on liver development in mouse models and evidence for 
abnormal fatty acid metabolism and liver steatosis in patients with SMA Type 1-3. For this reason, 
according to the applicant, the treatment with risdiplam may contribute to stabilizing liver function in 
SMA patients by increasing SMN protein levels also outside of the CNS. The applicant agreed to comply 
with the requested commitments. to monitor for and to provide detailed data on the occurrence of AEs 
related to hepatic injury in the open-label extension phase of all ongoing clinical studies (follow-up 
duration of 5-year) and in the post-marketing setting. Therefore, a thorough analysis of these data in 
the upcoming PSURs will be provided.  
Concerning drug-to-drug interaction, as requested, a recommendation on the concomitant on caution 
in using medications with known or suspected retinal toxicity has been added to the SmPC. 
As regards to quality, the MAA should commit to conduct a new PET study according to Ph. Eur. 5.1.3.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The patient population enrolled in FIREFISH and SUNFISH trial is not representative of the broad 
indication initially sought by the applicant as patients with Type 4 SMA were not included in the clinical 
trials. As the result of the assessment, it was agreed to include in the approved indication only SMA 
types 1, 2 and 3, thus reflecting the population has been studied in clinical trials. 
SMA type 1: The results of FIREFISH Part 2 show favourable effects of risdiplam on motor milestones 
and survival at 12 months, compared to natural history data of Type 1 SMA patients. The effect is 
apparently maintained. 
Later onset SMA (Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3): Considering the slow progression of Type 2 
and Type 3 SMA, and although the modest effects observed on motor function may be sustained within 
24 mths of treatment, the relevance of the efficacy, particularly in older and later onset SMA patients, 
is still not clear.  
assessment report  
EMA/1216061/2021 
Page 290/293 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some concerns raised by the safety profile of risdiplam remain, especially the long-term adverse 
events, but its relevance is being clarified in the ongoing 5 years follow-up study and can be dealt with 
the appropriate risk minimisation measures. 
As regards to quality aspects, the applicant commits to reduce the amount of preservative after the 
marketing authorisation is granted as recommended in the EMA guidelines. Concerning the 
communication on leakage from commercial product, besides the commitment requested to the 
applicant whereby the container closure system and packaging material will be thoroughly reviewed, 
further requested clarifications on the safety impact of this quality defect and further implementations 
of the PI were made as well as clarifications on the measures that have been put in place to actively 
search for leaking bottles events and to actively monitor potential safety issues related to leaking 
bottles in the open-label extension phase of all ongoing clinical studies and in the post-marketing 
setting. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant effect, of sufficient magnitude and duration, on development milestones in mild to 
moderate SMA 1, and on motor function in SMA type 2 and non-ambulant type 3 patients, has been 
identified.  
The risks associated with risdiplam treatment are considered manageable in the clinical setting. 
Enrolled patients in the risdiplam clinical development programme were symptomatic patients with 
SMA type 1, type 2 and type 3. For these patients a positive B/R ratio can be established and further 
information to be gathered in the agreed post authorisation PAES. Patients with type 4 SMA were not 
included, hence it was not possible to conclude on the B/R ratio in this population.  
It may be acknowledged that the overall findings of the risdiplam studies and the literature support the 
early initiation of treatment with risdiplam. The benefit/risk balance is therefore considered favourable 
also in patients with up to 4 SMN2 copies that have received a genetic diagnosis, considering the 
unmet need and extrapolating the observed beneficial effects from the symptomatic patients. The 
uncertainties of such extrapolation of the data from symptomatic patients to pre- or pauci-
symptomatic patients that have not yet reached the criteria for clinical diagnosis are also expected to 
be clarified by the data, generated in the agreed post-authorisation measures. 
The clinical course of SMA in patients with 4 copies of SMN2 that have received a genetic diagnosis is 
not considered to be straightforward. In the significant majority of cases patients with four copies of 
the SMN2 gene will develop clinically a milder form of the disease i.e. SMA type 2 or SMA type 3. Even 
though these are considered “milder” in comparison to SMA type 1, it has to be recognised that SMA 
type 3 is still a seriously debilitating disease, significantly affecting the life of the patients. In a 
minority of cases a patient with 4 copies of SMN2 will develop the disorder once adulthood has been 
reached i.e. SMA type 4. If this is the case, it is reasonable to assume that such patients likely possess 
protective factors that prevent an earlier expression of the disease. In these patients, together with 
patients with more than 4 copies of SMN2, the positive benefit cannot yet be extrapolated from the 
results of the clinical trials in the development programme for risdiplam. As such, the approved 
indication for risdiplam does not currently include patients with SMA type 4.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R ratio of Evrysdi is positive in the approved indication. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that risdiplam is not similar to Spinraza (nusinersen) and 
Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
(EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Evrysdi is favourable in the following indication: 
“Evrysdi is indicated for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients 2 months of age 
and older, with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2 copies.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
●  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
●  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that risdiplam is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Risdiplam is not used in any medicinal product previously authorised in the European Union (EU), and 
is not a salt, complex, or isomer or mixture of isomers, or a derivative of an authorised active 
substance the administration of risdiplam would not expose the patient to the same therapeutic moiety 
as an active substance already authorised in the EU.

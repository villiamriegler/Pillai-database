Summary 
On the basis of the number of events of uveal inflammation that 
occurred coincident to etanercept use, the number of reports in 
etanercept patients with RA, published literature, and the reports of 
positive dechallenge and rechallenge, the proposal for addition of this 
event to Section 4.8 of the SPC as an uncommon adverse drug reaction 
is considered appropriate. The change made to the Package Leaflet is 
consistent with the SPC change, and is appropriate. 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and on the 
basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product 
continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that that the benefit risk profile of Enbrel continues to be 
favorable. The CHMP recommends the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Enbrel with unlimited validity.

Results from 5 clinical studies demonstrate that the long-term use of 
etanercept in the treatment of plaque psoriasis provides sustained 
efficacy and safety in the treatment of psoriasis with no evidence of 
increased toxicity. Thus, treatment beyond the current restriction of 24 
weeks is supported, and provides a useful alternative to meeting the 
needs of patients. The removal of a time restriction for treatment 
courses in adult psoriasis is in line with other biological 
immunosuppressive therapies, many of which have a smaller safety 
database. No reliable predictive factors were identified, which would 
provide guidance to clinicians regarding those subjects who would be 
most appropriate for continuous therapy. Therefore, the decision to use 
intermittent or continuous therapy should be based on the physician's 
judgment in consultation with the patient, as specified in the CHMP 
psoriasis guidelines

SPC, PL 
A review of data from a pooled analysis of clinical trials, findings from 
published epidemiologic studies, and information from the MAH's 
pharmacovigilance database shows that etanercept is ineffective in the 
treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Furthermore in one study, the outcome 
of subjects receiving etanercept therapy included significantly higher 
rates of mortality (at 6 months) and serious infections than subjects 
receiving placebo. The use of etanercept's product information in the 
treatment of patients with alcoholic hepatitis is therefore not 
recommended.  The product information has been updated accordingly.

The MAH also took the opportunity to 
update the Enbrel's 50mg presentations PL 
by deleting the sentence "Enbrel 50 mg 
should only be used by adults (aged 18 and 
over)". Enbrel 50 mg presentations were 
authorised for use in the paediatric 
population, therefore the sentence is no 
longer applicable. 
Summary 
Opportunistic infections have been reported in association with 
etanercept (including invasive fungal, protozoal, bacterial and atypical 
mycobacterial infections). The most commonly reported invasive 
fungal infection was Pneumocystis; the second most commonly 
reported infection was Aspergillus. The MAH has investigated the 
opportunistic infections reported in completed clinical trials involving 
the administration of etanercept in all authorised indications. The MAH 
has also retrieved relevant case reports committed to the etanercept 
safety database up to 30 October 2008. The data suggest an increased 
risk of opportunistic infections associated with etanercept. The 
comparative clinical trial data set suggests an approximately threefold 
excess risk compared to controls. Opportunistic infections in the 
postmarketing setting appear to be associated with an appreciable 
mortality which may have been preventable if the nature of the 
infection had been correctly recognised and treated at an earlier stage 
in the illness.   
The SPC has previously noted a risk of opportunistic infection. 
Additional information to include these findings has been added to the 
relevant sections of the product information.

Based on the data from clinical trial, the posology for plaque psoriasis 
was updated to include the possibility of administration of 50 g once 
weekly. The data showed that the 50 mg weekly regimen can be used 
as an alternative to 25 mg twice weekly. 
There were no new safety signals from the data presented nor would 
this be expected in view of the limited change in posology.   
Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC were updated. Section 3 of the PL 
was updated accordingly. In addition the MAH took the opportunity to 
add a statement "You or the child should not use Enbrel with medicines 
that contain the active ingredient anakinra or abatacept" which was 
originally intended to be added with variation EMEA/H/C/262/II/87.

which showed a higher frequency of serious 
7/18  
In the 14th PSUR (covering the period from 3 August 2006 to 2 
February 2007), the Marketing Authorisation Holder provided a 
cumulative review of reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD) from 
clinical studies, spontaneous ADR reports and from the published 
literature.  A total of 252 medically confirmed reports of ILD  
(including pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonitis), which were reported 
in association with etanercept therapy have been reviewed. Many of the 
reports described a similar presentation of flu-like symptoms or 
respiratory symptoms and negative lung cultures.  Many of the patients 
responded to steroid treatment; however some were associated with a 
fatal outcome.   Although many of the reports were confounded by past 
medical history of respiratory disorders and use of concomitant 
medications, there were spontaneous reports which suggested a causal 
association with etanercept therapy.  The estimated frequency of ILD 
was determined to be uncommon. Thus, section 4.8 of the SPC was 
updated to include the new adverse event "interstitial lung disease 
(including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis)" under the new 
category "Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders". 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder provided data from two published 
studies which showed that there was a higher frequency of adverse 
events in rheumatoid arthritis patients when abatacept was used 
concomitantly with biological therapies, including etanercept. 
Furthermore, patients did not derive any extra benefits from this 
combined treatment.  Thus, the CHMP concluded that the combination 
of abatacept and etanercept is not recommended.

Summary 
18/10/2007  19/11/2007 
SPC 
Following a post-approval commitment from the line extension 
EMEA/H/C/262/X/65 (Enbrel solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringes), the MAH presented data on anti-etanercept antibodies from 
5 long-term studies in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and 
psoriatic arthritis. This analysis showed that antibodies to etanercept 
have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. 
These antibodies have all been non-neutralising and were generally 
transient and there appeared to be no correlation between antibody 
development and clinical response or adverse events. 
In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials 
for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies 
were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of 
subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2.0% of subjects with ankylosing 
spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, and 3% of subjects with 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  
The proportion of subjects who developed antibodies to etanercept in 
longer-term trials (of up to 3.5 years) increases over time, as expected. 
However, due to their transient nature, the incidence of antibodies 
detected at each assessment point was typically less than 7% in 
rheumatoid arthritis subjects and psoriasis subjects. In a long-term 
psoriasis study in which patients received 50 mg twice weekly for 96 
weeks, the incidence of antibodies observed at each assessment point 
was up to approximately 9%.

information that no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions 
were observed in studies with digoxin.  
From the results of the study on the interaction between etanercept and 
warfarin, it emerged that no significant change in etanercept 
pharmacokinetics was observed after etanercept and warfarin 
combination therapy. Thus, section 4.5 was updated to include a 
statement that no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions 
were observed in studies with warfarin.  
Following the assessment of PSUR n. 13, the CHMP concluded that 
based on the safety profile for Enbrel in the currently authorised 
therapeutic indications the PSUR cycle should revert to yearly 
reporting instead of the current 6-monthly cycle. Thus, Annex II was 
updated to reflect that PSURs should be submitted annually. 
The MAH conducted a cumulative review of safety data to identify 
reports on reactivation of viral hepatitis in etanercept-treated patients 
who had chronic viral hepatitis prior to the Enbrel therapy.  This 
review identified reports on reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV), in 
patients who were chronic carriers of this virus, and reports of 
worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving Enbrel. Patients at risk 
for HBV infection should be evaluated for prior evidence of HBV 
infection before initiating Enbrel therapy. Caution should also be 
exercised when administering Enbrel to patients identified as carriers 
of HBV. 
Since serious infections and cases of active tuberculosis have been 
reported in patients treated with Enbrel, recommendations, regarding 
the evaluation of patients for infections before, during and after Enbrel 
use, including screening and appropriate treatment for tuberculosis in 
all patients prior to initiating Enbrel therapy, have been added to the 
Enbrel SPC. 
The text in section 4.4 of the SPC has been re-organised under two 
paragraphs, "Immunosuppression" and "Malignancies and 
lymphoproliferative disorders", and section 4.8 of the SPC has been 
revised to focus on serious infections.

the SPC, the labelling and section 6 "Further information. What Enbrel 
contains" have been updated to include the two new excipients 
"sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate" and "sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihydrate". Additionally, the product information has been 
updated in accordance with the latest QRD template version 7.2. 
Clinical and radiographic results from a 2 year clinical study in patients 
with active psoriatic arthritis were assessed. The study began with a 6-
month double blind, placebo-controlled period where patients were 
randomised to receive subcutaneous injections of 25 mg etanercept or 
placebo twice weekly.  Patients could then continue in a blinded 
maintenance period of up to 6 months, until all patients had completed 
the initial 6-month period. After the maintenance period, all subjects 
received open-label 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly for 1 year. 
Radiographs of hands and wrists were obtained at baseline and months 
6, 12, and 24. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of 
the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the 
percentage of patients without progression at 12 months was higher in 
the Enbrel group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, 
respectively). The effect of Enbrel on radiographic progression was 
maintained in patients who continued on treatment during the second

Summary 
year. The slowing of peripheral joint damage was observed in patients 
with polyarticular symmetrical joint involvement. Enbrel treatment 
resulted in improvement in physical function during the double blind 
period, and this benefit was maintained during the longer term 
exposure of up to 2 years. 
Therefore section 4.1 "Therapeutic indications" of the SPC was 
updated to include that Enbrel has been shown to improve physical 
function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of 
progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X ray in 
patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Additionally, section 5.1 "Pharmacodynamic properties" of the SPC 
was updated to include the radiographic results observed in this clinical 
study in patients with active psoriatic arthritis. 
As during the open-label period of the study 1 patient reported a 
serious infection (pneumonia), section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the 
SPC was updated accordingly. 
The PL, section 1 "What Enbrel is and what it is used for" was 
amended to reflect the update of the SPC. 
Following the assessment of safety data concerning the severity and 
localisation of infections observed in clinical studies in children with 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the CHMP concluded that a number of 
infections were mild to moderate in severity and that appendicitis 
needed to be included in section 4.8 of the SPC. Therefore the MAH 
amended section 4.8 of the SPC "Undesirable effects in paediatric 
patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis" to include "appendicitis" as a 
severe event observed in clinical trials in children and to indicate that 
infections seen in this population were generally mild to moderate in 
severity.

As requested by the CHMP following the 
assessment of PSUR n. 10 (covering the 
period from 20 July 2004 to 2 February 
2005), the MAH updated section 4.8 of the 
12/18  
This study showed that etanercept and its breakdown products are 
transferred to pups from maternal rats. Pups were exposed to 
significant amounts of Enbrel, and to greater amounts of breakdown 
products, after administration of Enbrel to maternal rats. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH to include in section 4.6 "Pregnancy 
and Lactation" of the SPC  information that etanercept was excreted in 
the milk of rats and detected in the serum of the pups as shown in a 
pre-clinical study. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied to extend the range of 
25mg and 50mg presentations to include a liquid formulation (solution 
for injection) in pre-filled syringes.  The new formulation has a 
modified formulation compared to the Enbrel presentations already 
approved (powder for solution for injection).  The main advantage with 
the pre-filled syringe presentations is the elimination of the 
reconstitution step, facilitating administration of the product. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied to extend the range of 
25mg and 50mg presentations to include a 25mg formulation (powder 
for solution for injection) which is reconstituted with a bacteriostatic 
solvent for multidose administration.  The new formulation uses 
bacteriostatic solvent (benzyl alcohol) for reconstiution compared to 
the Enbrel presentations already approved (powder for solution for 
injection) which are reconstituted with water for injections.  The main 
advantage with the preserved paediatric presentation is the ability to 
use up to two doses of the product from the vial, thereby, reducing 
wastage. 
In the reporting period of the PSUR n. 10 (from 20 July 2004 to 2 
February 2005) the MAH received a total of 38 reports covering 49 
medically confirmed suspected adverse reactions relating to abnormal 
liver function tests. The reports were similar to those discussed in the 
cumulative review of hepatic disorders that the MAH has provided 
along with PSUR n. 10.

Summary 
SPC to include a new "rare" undesirable 
effect (Elevated liver enzymes) under a new 
body system (Hepatobiliary disorders).  
As requested by the CHMP following the 
outcome of an Ad Hoc Expert Group 
meeting on TNF-antagonists, the MAH 
updated section 4.4 of the SPC to include a 
possible risk for the development of 
lymphomas or other malignancies in patients 
treated with a TNF-antagonist. 
Section 4. of the PL has been amended to 
reflect the new undesirable effect. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
improve the clarity of the instructions 
provided in the section "Instructions for 
preparing and giving an injection of Enbrel" 
in the PL. 
Additionally, following a request from the 
CHMP the wording of the indication 
'polyarticular-course juvenile chronic 
arthritis' has been modified to reflect the 
currently valid definition 'polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis'. 
The CHMP concluded that a large number of reports of hepatobiliary 
disorders have been presented in the PSUR n.10, some of which 
provided reasonable information on positive dechallenge and 
rechallenge. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should 
provide a further review of hepatobiliary disorders in the next PSUR 
with a view to updating the Product Information with a statement 
regarding this issue. Therefore, the MAH has examined his database 
with a focus on case reports containing at least one event coded to 
MedDRA terms consistent with elevation of liver enzymes, without a 
reasonable alternative explanation for the event, and which showed 
evidence of a positive rechallenge or dechallenge. 
The MAH concluded on the basis of this analysis that there are 
reasonable grounds to suspect a causal association between etanercept 
administration and the occurrence of elevations of serum 
concentrations of hepatic enzymes.  
The MAH estimated the frequency of elevation of liver enzymes in 
association with etanercept to be less than 1/1000 patients exposed, 
based on an analysis of the incidence of adverse events in placebo-
controlled clinical trials in which methotrexate was not allowed to be 
administered. Therefore section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the SPC 
has been updated to include "Hepatobiliary disorders: Rare: Elevated 
liver enzymes" and section 4 "Possible side effects" of the PL has been 
updated to include "Liver disorders: Rare: Elevated liver blood tests". 
Following the review of the available data on malignancies and 
lymphoproliferative disorders in patients treated with TNF Alpha 
Blockers, the CHMP concluded that section 4.4 "Special warnings and 
special precautions for use" should be updated to include the 
information that more cases of lymphoma have been observed among 
patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients  in 
the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, . However, 
the incidence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients 
was shorter than for patients receiving TNF-antagonist therapy. 
Furthermore, there is an increased background lymphoma risk in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, 
inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the

Summary 
current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas 
or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot 
be excluded. 
The section "Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of 
enbrel" has been updated to improve clarity in the instructions for 
preparing and giving Enbrel. 
The current wording 'polyarticular-course juvenile chronic arthritis' has 
been changed to reflect the currently valid definition 'polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis' throughout the entire Product Information. 
The recommended posology for Enbrel in psoriatic arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis is 25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly. The 
objective of this type II variation is to amend the dose regimen for 
etanercept to include 50 mg once per week in the treatment of psoriatic 
arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in adults in order to increase patient 
convenience and enhance compliance. 
The safety and efficacy of 50 mg Enbrel administered once weekly 
versus 25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly were evaluated in a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active 
ankylosing spondylitis. The primary objective of this study was to 
assess the efficacy and safety of etanercept 50 mg once weekly. The 
secondary objective was to evaluate the quality of life and 
pharmacokinetics of etanercept 50 mg once weekly. Subjects were 
randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous injections of 
etanercept 50 mg once weekly, etanercept 25 mg twice weekly or 
placebo. 
The results from this study indicate that the safety and efficacy profiles 
of the 50 mg once weekly and 25 mg twice weekly regimens were 
similar. In addition the two etanercept dosing regimens produce 
equivalent AUC exposure as demonstrated by a population 
pharmacokinetics analysis which found  that in these ankylosing 
spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466 
ug*hr/mL and 474 ug*h/mL for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (N= 154)

Update of sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SPC to reflect 2-year data from a 
controlled clinical study comparing Enbrel 
alone, methotrexate alone, and combination 
therapy with Enbrel and methotrexate, in 
adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Sections 1 
and 4 of the PL were updated in accordance. 
15/18  
and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively. 
The CHMP concluded that the results from this study can be 
extrapolated to patients with psoriatic arthritis given that etanercept is 
equally effective in this population. 
Clinical and radiographic  results from a 2-year  clinical study  
comparing Enbrel alone, methotrexate alone, and combination therapy 
with Enbrel and methotrexate have been assessed in adults with 
reumathoid arthritis. 
In this clinical  study, structural joint damage was assessed 
radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) 
and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score 
(JSN). Radiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline, 12, 
and 24 months. The results of this 2-year study showed that the mean 
changes from the baseline in TSS were lower for patients  in 
combination therapy with Enbrel and methotrexate  and the etanercept 
group  compared with the methotrexate group  and this was confirmed 
over 24 months. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of 
the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the 
percentage of patients without progression (TSS change = 0.5) at 24 
months was higher in the Enbrel in combination with methotrexate 
group compared with the Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone groups 
(62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p<0.05). The difference between 
Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p<0.05). 
Among patients who completed a full 24 months of therapy in the 
study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, 
respectively. 
The mean changes from baseline in erosion scores for the combination 
treatment group  and the etanercept group were significantly lower 
compared with the methotrexate group. At 24 months the combination-
treated patients had significantly lower erosion change scores than 
patients treated with etanercept alone. The mean changes from baseline 
to 12 and 24 months in joint space narrowing were significantly lower 
for patients in the combination group  compared with the methotrexate 
group . In conclusion significant advantages for Enbrel in combination 
with methotrexate compared with Enbrel monotherapy and 
methotrexate monotherapy were observed  after 24 months in adults

Summary 
with rheumatoid arthritis. 
The clinical results showed significant advantages for Enbrel in 
combination with methotrexate compared with Enbrel monotherapy 
and methotrexate monotherapy after 24 months in respect of  
ACR(American College of Rheumatology response criteria), HAQ 
(Health Assessment Questionnaire), and DAS (Disease activity score) 
Therefore the therapeutic indications were revised in order to reflect 
that the the combination of Enbrel with methotrexate has been shown 
to be superior to Enbrel monotherapy in the treatment of moderate to 
severe active rheumatoid arthritis. 
The package leaflet has been updated to reflect the changes to the SPC. 
This variation relates  to data submitted by the MAH concerning a trial 
in which patients with Wegener's granulomatosis were treated with 
etanercept or placebo (the Wegener's granulomatosis etanercept trial - 
WGET).  WGET was a placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 patients 
were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard therapy (including 
cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median 
duration of 25 months. The results of WGET  have not shown Enbrel 
to be an effective treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis.  The 
incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was 
significantly higher in patients treated with Enbrel than in the control 
group.  Since the results of WGET suggest that Enbrel is not 
recommended for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis, the 
MAH proposed to update section 4.4 "Special warnings and special 
precautions for use" and section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the SPC 
to include these new clinical data from WGET.

Following the assessment of data on quality, safety and efficacy the 
CHMP concluded that that the benefit/risk profile for Enbrel 50 mg for 
the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis, was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing 
authorisation for Enbrel 50 mg. 
"Click here for further information". 
The results of a clinical study showed that patients who were receiving 
sulfasalazine and Enbrel experienced a statistically significant decrease 
in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with 
Enbrel or sulfasalazine alone.  Therefore section 4.5 "Interaction with 
other medicinal products and other forms of interaction" in the SPC 
was updated to add these information on the interaction between 
sulfasalazine and Enbrel. 
In line with the company reference safety information,  the data  on a 
clinical study in patients with psoriatic arthritis receiving Enbrel and a 
vaccine were added in section  4.4 "Special warnings and special 
precautions for use"  in the SPC: most psoriatic arthritis patients 
receiving Enbrel were able to mount effective B-cell immune response 
to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titers in aggregate were 
moderately lower and few patients had two-fold rises in titers 
compared to patients not receiving Enbrel. Section 4.5 "Interaction 
with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction" in the 
SPC was amended as well (deletion of statement "No data are available 
on the effects of vaccination in patients receiving Enbrel"). 
The order of instructions for preparing and giving an injection of 
Enbrel in the PL was amended for greater clarity.

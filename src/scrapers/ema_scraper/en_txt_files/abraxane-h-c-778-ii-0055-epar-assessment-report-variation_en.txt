2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
In Europe, pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death with approximately 
95,200 deaths each year and over 99% of affected patients dying of their disease. The incidence of 
pancreatic cancer is higher in men than women and increases with age, with 90% of pancreatic cancer 
presenting in patients over the age of 55 years and more than 70% presenting over the age of 65 
years. The incidence varies from 0.5-3.6 per 100.000 for persons below the age of 50 years to 55.9-
89.2 per 100.000 for persons above the age of 75 years. Risk factors for development of pancreatic 
cancer include a family history of pancreatic cancer, cigarette smoking, obesity and chronic 
pancreatitis. 
Exocrine tumours are by far the most common type of pancreatic cancer, with adenocarcinoma 
accounting for about 95% of cancers of the exocrine pancreas. Initial staging classifies pancreatic 
cancers as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced and metastatic. In the case of resectable 
disease, the entire tumour can be surgically removed whereas for both locally advanced and metastatic 
disease, the tumour cannot be completely removed, and surgery would only be conducted to relieve 
symptoms.  
For all stages of pancreatic cancer combined, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in the EU is about 
5% (Sant et al, 2009). For patients with localised disease and small cancers (<2 cm) with no lymph 
node metastases and no extension beyond the capsule of the pancreas, complete surgical resection is 
associated with an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 18% to 24%. Median survival for patients with 
locally advanced unresectable disease is 8 to 12 months and only three to six months for those who 
present with metastases. In patients with metastatic disease, the 5-year OS rate is 1.6%. 
Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment. The highest cure rate occurs if the tumour 
is truly localised to the pancreas; however, this stage of disease account for less than 20% of cases 
and only 15 to 20% of patients are candidates for pancreatectomy. Most patients (80 to 85%) have 
unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis. 
For patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, single agent systemic chemotherapy has been the 
mainstay of treatment. However, among active single agents, none has been consistently associated 
with objective response rates above 10% or median survival durations above 6 to 7 months. 
Gemcitabine has been the standard chemotherapy for first line treatment of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma. A phase II study comparing gemcitabine to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) suggested that 
patients who lacked an objective response to treatment often had improvement in symptoms (i.e., 
pain, weight loss) and performance status (Rothenber et al, 1996). The percentage of patients who 
derived clinical benefit from therapy was almost three-fold higher than the fraction that had an 
objective antitumor response (11% vs 27%). In another phase II trial, a significantly better overall 
survival (5.6 vs 4.4 months) was demonstrated for gemcitabine in comparison to 5-FU (Burris et al, 
1997).  
Although gemcitabine monotherapy is generally well tolerated, median OS remains less than 6 months 
in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. In several clinical trials, gemcitabine activity in combination 
with other active cytotoxic agents including 5-FU, cisplatin, docetaxel, oxaliplatin and irinotecan has 
been studied. In general, other chemotherapy combinations failed to achieve improvement in OS over 
Abraxane

Page 7/63 
  
 
 
 
 
three weeks or were accompanied by increased toxicity, limiting the number of patients that can 
actually use these therapy regimens. 
The superiority of short-term infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) over 
gemcitabine monotherapy was initially suggested in a randomised phase II study conducted in 176 
patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX was associated with a 
high objective response rate (39% vs 11% with gemcitabine alone; Ychou et al, 2007). The study was 
expanded to a phase III trial (the Accord 11 trial) in which a total of 342 patients with chemotherapy-
naïve, metastatic pancreatic cancer, were randomly assigned to gemcitabine alone versus 
FOLFIRINOX. The trial was stopped after enrolling only 250 patients at a pre-planned interim analysis 
showing a significantly higher objective response rate with FOLFIRINOX (31.6% versus 9.4%), longer 
median PFS (6.4 vs 3.3 months) and overall survival (11.1 vs 6.8 months). The increased efficacy of 
FOLFIRINOX compared to gemcitabine was accompanied with significantly higher treatment related 
toxicity with FOLFIRINOX (Conroy et al, 2011).  
Finally, gemcitabine combined with erlotinib has been approved for the treatment of metastatic 
pancreatic cancer (Moore et al, 2007), but due to the very limited improvement in OS and the 
observed add-on toxicity, the combination gemcitabine-erlotinib is not frequently used in clinical 
practice.  
About the product 
Abraxane contains paclitaxel as the active substance formulated as albumin-bound nanoparticles. 
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers 
and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation, so that the normal dynamic reorganisation 
of the microtubule network, essential for vital cellular functions, is inhibited. The albumin-bound 
paclitaxel is expected to be more water-soluble, to achieve higher delivery of paclitaxel to the tumour 
and to cause less frequent hypersensitivity reactions compared to conventional solvent-based 
paclitaxel formulations due to the absence of Cremophor-EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil), a solvent 
present in standard paclitaxel formulations that has been associated with acute infusion-related 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in adult 
patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard 
anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated. The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 
mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. 
With this variation application for addition of a new therapeutic indication, the MAH proposed the use 
of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine in the first line treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
The clinical development of Abraxane for the treatment of advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas 
included a phase I/II study CA040 to determine the MTD, DLTs and initial antitumour activity of 
Abraxane followed by gemcitabine and a randomised, pivotal phase III Study CA046.  
Orphan drug designation was granted to nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel for the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer in the EU on 26 November 2010 (EU orphan designation number EU/3/10/809). The 
designation was withdrawn prior to the submission of this variation.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology of the active substance paclitaxel is well-known and in the initial Marketing 
Authorisation application (MAA) of Abraxane, several in vitro studies were submitted to compare the 
effect of solvent and albumin nanoparticles as carriers of paclitaxel on trans-endothelial transport and 
cellular uptake. Based on these studies it was suggested that Abraxane may result in higher tumour 
concentrations because of a) decreased bioavailability of paclitaxel due to sequestration in the plasma 
by Cremophor micelles, b) increased trans-endothelial transport that is mediated by the gp-60 albumin 
receptor and c) increased accumulation in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein 
SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine). 
At the time of the MAA, a set of pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies were conducted with 
Abraxane with a goal of understanding the dispositional differences, if any, between Abraxane and the 
solvent-based paclitaxel formulation Taxol (CrEL:ethanol vehicle). Extensive studies to determine the 
metabolic pathways were not submitted in this application (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Information derived from the literature was provided as supportive information for plasma protein 
binding, placental transfer, hepatic metabolism of paclitaxel and interaction with transporters.  
Regarding toxicology, the nonclinical toxicology development program in the original MAA was focused 
on evaluating the safety or efficacy of paclitaxel in Abraxane compared to the Cremophor-EL-based 
comparator, Taxol. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
With this variation application, several nonclinical studies investigated the anti-tumour activity of 
Abraxane as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine in different pancreatic tumour models 
(see Table 1). 
A further in vitro study was submitted (XP-001) to compare the transport of paclitaxel across 
endothelial cells and uptake of paclitaxel in endothelial and cancer cells (PC-3 prostate cancer and HT-
29 colon cancer) treated with Abraxane and Cremophor-based paclitaxel. The results indicated that 
CrEL significantly decreased paclitaxel transport across endothelial cells and interrupted paclitaxel 
uptake in both endothelial and tumour cells in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown).

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
New data on pharmacokinetics were collected in toxicology studies SNBL.119.11 and 08AC21. 
Furthermore a drug-drug interaction study between Abraxane and gemcitabine was submitted (ABI PK 
01005). 
Study 08AC21 evaluated the repeat-dose toxicity potential of intermittent administration of Abraxane 
(0, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg, every 5 days for 6 doses) given to Crl:CD(SD) rats; paclitaxel (PTX) at 
10 mg/kg was also given as comparative control article. Toxicokinetics showed that Cmax and AUC0-24h 
increased dose-dependently and there were no remarkable gender differences on each dosing day in 
the Abraxane groups. In the PTX group, Cmax and AUC0-24h were higher than those in the Abraxane 
10 mg/kg group for both sexes. Cmax and AUC0-24h increased in all dosing groups at the final dosing in 
comparison to the first dosing. 
Study SNBL.119.11 evaluated the pharmacokinetic and toxicological interaction between nab 17-AAG 
(geldanamycin (17-AAG) compounded with human serum albumin nanoparticles, 9 mg/kg), Abraxane 
(9 mg/kg), and Herceptin (12.4 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys following once weekly intravenous 
administration for three weeks. This study included an Abraxane-only arm (9 mg/kg). In the Abraxane 
single agent treatment group, the mean paclitaxel Cmax and AUC appeared slightly higher in females 
than males and this difference was increased when Abraxane was combined with nab 17-AAG. 
Furthermore, nab 17-AAG appeared to cause accumulation of paclitaxel.  
The drug-drug interaction study in rat (ABI-PK-01005) between Abraxane and gemcitabine was 
performed as data indicated that Abraxane-derived paclitaxel modulated intracellular disposition of 
gemcitabine (Frese et al, 2012). However, the study did not reveal any statistically significant 
differences in plasma paclitaxel and gemcitabine pharmacokinetics (Cmax and AUClast) when 
administered concurrently vs as single agents following a single intravenous dose (paclitaxel 21 mg/kg, 
gemcitabine 167 mg/kg), but the exposure to the inactive metabolite of gemcitabine dFdU was 2-fold 
increased in presence of paclitaxel. However, such an increase was not observed in clinical studies 
using a different paclitaxel formulation (paclitaxel 100-175 mg/m2, gemcitabine 1000-2000 mg/m2) 
and different schedules (Fogli et al, 2001,; Fogli et al, 2002; Kroep et al, 1999; Kroep et al, 2006).

A recent publication on transplacental transport of paclitaxel in baboons (Calsteren et al, 2010) 
confirmed previous mouse data that paclitaxel crosses the placental barrier, albeit to a limited extent. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study 08CA21 was a GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in rats of Abraxane at 0, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg, 
and paclitaxel (PTX) at 10 mg/kg, intravenously a total of 6 times every 5 days over a 30-day period. 
Mortality occurred in 1/32, 4/32, and 23/32 rats in Abraxane 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg groups, 
respectively. All animals in the 10 mg/kg paclitaxel group survived throughout the study. The observed 
toxicity consisted mainly of clinical signs (alopecia, scab formation, oedema, gait effects, weight loss, 
food consumption), atrophic changes in the lymphatic/haematopoietic tissues, male reproductive 
organs, and skin and degenerative changes in the nervous system and eyes. The toxicological 
characteristics of Abraxane were similar to those of PTX. The changes in the reproductive organs, 
nervous system, or eye in the Abraxane and paclitaxel groups were not (fully) reversible within the 
4 week recovery period. 
Study SNBL.119.11 was a GLP-compliant weekly toxicology study evaluating the pharmacokinetic and 
toxicological profile of nab 17-AAG (17-AAG compounded with human serum albumin nanoparticles) 
when administered in conjunction with Abraxane and Herceptin. This study included an Abraxane-only 
arm, in which 9 mg/kg Abraxane (108 mg/m2) was administered by intravenous infusion to 3 males 
and 3 females on a weekly schedule for three weeks. Other treatment arms were nab 17-AAG alone, 
nab 17-AAG with Abraxane, nab 17-AAG + Abraxane and Herceptin, and vehicle control. 
Administration of Abraxane alone resulted in adverse clinical observations (inappetence, hunched 
posture, liquid/soft/dry/mucous/bloody/black faeces, and/or emesis), decreased food consumption (in 
females) and body weights (in females), and changes in urinalysis (red colour, glucose, and nitrite), 
haematology (decreases in white blood cell count, red cell mass, and reticulocytes and increased red 
cell distribution width), and serum chemistry (decreased albumin) parameters. Post-mortem changes 
resulting from Abraxane administration included gross lesions (decreased thymic size), organ weight 
changes (increases in spleen weights and decreases in thymus, pituitary, testes, liver, and 
thyroid/parathyroid weights), and histopathologic lesions (decreased thymic cellularity in all animals, 
myocardial karyomegaly, seminiferous tubule degeneration in all males and hepatic leukocytosis and 
centrilobular vacuolation). A NOAEL was not established in this study. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an ERA based on the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 guideline (EMEA, 2006).  
An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline. However, published prevalence data 
indicate the number of patients with MBC in the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) to be 
171,655 (CancerMpact© data, Kantar Health (Kantar Health Epi Database ®, October 2011.)). 
Extrapolating to the EU27 estimated population of 502,489,143, this would be a number of 272,920 
which can be divided by the population of the EU27 to give a prevalence of 0.00055 (0.05%) for MBC.  
Similarly, data indicate the prevalence of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the EU5 to be 37,380 
(CancerMpact© data, Kantar Health), which can be extrapolated to 59,382 in the EU27, giving a 
prevalence of 59,382/502,489,143 or 0.0001 (0.01%).  
The maximum daily dose for MBC is 260 mg/m2/day (442 mg/inh/day assuming 1.7m2 average body 
surface per patient) with a maximum of 18 cycles per year. The maximum daily dose for pancreatic

adenocarcinoma is 125 mg/m2 (225 mg/inh/day assuming 1.8m2 average body surface per patient) 
on day 1, 8, 15 of a 28 day cycle (a maximum of 12 cycles per year). Thus, the Fpen is further 
modified as follows: 
Fpen = Pregion x (ttreatment x ntreatment, p/Nd) 
Thus Fpen (MBC) = 0.00055 x (1 day x 18 cycles/365 days) = 0.0000271 and 
Fpen (AP) = 0.0001 x (3 days x 12 cycles/365 days) = 0.0000099

the combined PEC amounts to 0.007 µg/L, which is below the trigger of 0.10 µg/L. 
No specific study was conducted to determine the partition coefficient (logKow) of paclitaxel. Estimates 
of partition coefficient values for paclitaxel were available from published literature and from public 
domain websites (data not shown). 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
During the Marketing Authorisation application for Abraxane in the (second line) treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer, the strategy of the nonclinical development had been to conduct specific 
studies in vitro or in animal models to address the likely alterations in systemic exposure, efficacy and 
any change in safety assessment due to the change in formulation from Cremophor-EL-based to 
nanoparticulate, albumin-bound. 
It was previously suggested that albumin binding proteins, such as SPARC, may play a role in the 
uptake and distribution of Abraxane. In the clinic it has been noted that high expression levels of 
SPARC in the stroma of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were correlated with improved 
survival (Von Hoff et al, 2011; clinical study CA040 below). Yet it currently remains unclear to what 
extent SPARC expression in pancreatic tumours may contribute to the antitumour activity of Abraxane. 
Both Von Hoff et al (2011) and Frese et al (2012) reported that the intra-tumour concentration of 
gemcitabine was increased by Abraxane co-treatment. Overall, non-clinical pharmacology data support 
the rationale for the use of Abraxane in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, alone or combined with 
gemcitabine. As the predictive value of nonclinical models in oncology is relatively limited, further 
evidence should be obtained clinically. 
Several recent nonclinical studies by the MAH or in the literature (Desai et al, 2008; Volk et al, 2008; 
Volk et al, 2011; Report BTC-X8009; Report BTC-X8010) have suggested the antitumour activity of 
Abraxane alone or in combination with e.g. bevacizumab in other tumour models. 
It was concluded that the primary pharmacology experiments with Abraxane have thus shown that this 
nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel formulation retains the desired antitumour activity against 
various cancer cell types in vivo, both as a single agent and in combination with bevacizumab.

The metabolism of paclitaxel is well described in the literature and it is not expected to change based 
on the differences in the formulation, therefore lack of extensive studies to determine the metabolic 
pathways in this application is justified. Information derived from the literature was provided as 
supportive information for plasma protein binding, placental transfer, hepatic metabolism of paclitaxel 
and interaction with transporters.  
The difference in exposure between Abraxane and paclitaxel has been noted in previous studies. 
In study 08AC21, exposures were higher at the end of study when compared to first day treatment. 
This suggests that some accumulation may occur, although the increase in exposure was maximally 
2-fold. As kinetics in patients was linear, no accumulation is expected in the clinic. 
Studies SNBL.119.11 and ABI-PK-01005 suggested that there is no/limited pharmacokinetic interaction 
of Abraxane with gemcitabine or Herceptin; however, an interaction with albumin bound geldanamycin 
(nab 17-AAG) may not be excluded. Studies reported in the literature (Fogli et al, 2001,; Fogli et al, 
2002; Kroep et al, 1999; Kroep et al, 2006) indicated that paclitaxel and gemcitabine did not affect 
each other’s pharmacokinetics to a significant extent. Therefore, the absence of pharmacokinetic data 
regarding the interaction between paclitaxel and gemcitabine is considered acceptable. Relevant 
information has been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
No unexpected effects of Abraxane treatment were seen in the two newly submitted repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. 
In study SNBL.119.11, deaths were noted in two groups, both receiving Abraxane in combination with 
other substances. It was concluded that treatment with Abraxane resulted in the earlier onset and 
more significant toxicity when compared to the other two substances (nab 17-AAG or Herceptin). 
Regarding the ERA, the MAH considered that based on the overall consistency of the reported logKow 
values, it is reasonable to utilise these and not determine the logKow experimentally. Based on these 
data, the logKow ≥ 4.5 trigger value for further Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity testing is 
not exceeded and therefore supports the conclusion in the Environmental Risk Assessment that no 
further assessment is necessary. However, the CHMP considered that the logKow for paclitaxel has not 
been determined adequately to date and requested that this is determined experimentally after 
approval of the variation application. It should be noted that the expected log P of paclitaxel exceeds 4 
(ClogP estimate is 4.73) which is out of range of the shake flask method. Log P values > 4 can only be 
reliably determined using the slow stirring method (OECD TG 123).  
On the other hand, the PECsw was 0.007 µg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A further 
risk assessment was not deemed necessary. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall non-clinical data support the rationale for the use of Abraxane in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 
alone or combined with gemcitabine. 
The environmental risk assessment cannot be finalised as the PBT assessment cannot be concluded. 
The logKow study needs to be evaluated. Considering the above data, paclitaxel formulated as albumin 
bound nanoparticles is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
Nevertheless, in the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
• 
The logKow needs to be evaluated, if necessary via a dedicated relevant study.

gemcitabine.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data regarding pharmacodynamics were submitted. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No data regarding PK/PD modelling were submitted. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new pharmacokinetics data have been submitted for the combination of 125 mg/m2 Abraxane with 
1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine. The Abraxane dose of 125 mg/m2 is within the dose range of 80 to 300 
mg/m2 that has demonstrated dose linear pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. 
Paclitaxel and gemcitabine do not share a common metabolic pathway. Paclitaxel clearance is primarily 
determined by cytochrome P450 2C8 and 3A4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary excretion, while 
gemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase followed by urinary excretion (Walle et al, 1995; 
Plunkett et al, 1995). 
Nonclinical data and clinical data have shown there is no pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction 
between paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Of note, the combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel is 
approved for the first line treatment of non-resectable, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer 
following adjuvant/neo-adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Analysis of data from 
metastatic breast cancer patients showed that, on average, gemcitabine has little or no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics (clearance and half-life) of paclitaxel and paclitaxel has little or no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine (Gemzar SmPC). As no significant impact on the pharmacokinetic 
profiles of paclitaxel and gemcitabine was observed in non-clinical study ABI-PK-01005 (discussed in 
the non-clinical section), there was no need to collect  PK data for the combination of Abraxane and 
gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There were no clinical pharmacology concerns related to the combination of Abraxane with gemcitabine 
for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study CA040 was a phase I/II, single-arm, dose escalation study designed to determine the MTD and 
DLTs of Abraxane/gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Three dose level of 
Abraxane were evaluated: 100, 125 and 150 mg/m2. Patients received study treatment on Days 1, 8 
and 15 of a 28 day cycle.  The initial dose of Abraxane 100 mg/m2 was based on safety and efficacy 
data collected for Abraxane-refractory advanced solid tumours or metastatic breast cancer and in 
taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer.  
Three patients were enrolled at each dose level starting with a dose of Abraxane 100 mg/m2 followed 
by gemcitabine 100 mg/m2. If 1 of up to 3 patients developed a DLT, up to 6 patients were enrolled at 
that dose level. If 2 of the 6 patients experienced a DLT, the next dose below the DLT-dose was 
defined as the MTD. During the study, the protocol was amended to enrol additional patients at the 
100 mg/m2 and 125 mg/m2 dose level. Once the MTD was established, additional patients were 
enrolled during the Phase 2 portion of the study to include at least 42 patients at the MTD.   
Abraxane

Overall, 22 patients (33%; 95% CI: 21.6, 44.1) had a confirmed overall response (all PRs). For 
patients in the Abraxane 125 mg/m2 cohort, 17 patients (39%; 95% CI: 24.2, 53.0) had confirmed 
overall response. 
Table 3: Independent Radiological Reviewer Assessment of Overall Response Rate 
(study CA040, Treated Population) 
The disease control rate (ie, SD for ≥16 weeks, or complete or partial overall response) was 54% for 
all patients and 55% for patients in the Abraxane 125 mg/m2 cohort. 
A total of 37 (55%) patients had independently-determined PFS events, the median PFS was 6.1 
months (95% CI: 5.4, 9.2). In the Abraxane 125 mg/m2 cohort, 25 (57%) patients had independently 
determined PFS events; the median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI: 4.8, 9.2).  
Table 4: Independent Radiological Reviewer Assessed Progression-free Survival (Study 
CA040, Treated Population)  
The patients who did not have progression or had not died were censored at the last known time that 
they were progression-free. Patients who initiated other anticancer therapy before disease progression 
were censored at the time when the new anticancer therapy was initiated. A total of 30 (45%) patients 
and 19 (43%) in the Abraxane 125 mg/m2 cohort were censored. The most common reasons for 
censoring in all patients and patients in the Abraxane 125 mg/m2 cohort were missing assessment 
followed by PFS even (31% and 30%, respectively), and new anticancer therapy (9% and 11%, 
respectively. The median follow-up time for censored patients was 4.5 and 4.8 months, respectively. 
Patients were followed for survival for a median of 13 months. Overall 58 (87%) patients died, and the 
median OS was 10.3 months (955 CI: 8.4, 13,6). For patients in the Abraxane 124 mg/m2 cohort, 38 
(86%) patients died by the data cutoff; the median OS was 12.2 months (95% CI: 8.9, 17.9).

Treatments 
Patients were treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine or gemcitabine alone. The cycle 
length in both arms was 56 days during Cycle 1 and 28 days from Cycle 2 onward. Treatment with 
study drug continued until one or more of the following: 
- 
Progressive disease 
-  Development of toxicity (treatment-related AE) unacceptable in the opinion of the investigator 
- 
- 
Patient declined to continue therapy 
If, following the second dose reduction, there was a recurrence of Grade 4 neutropenia, or any 
other Grade 3 or 4 hematologic AE, or non-myelosuppressive AE, unless, there was evidence of 
continuing benefit to the patient that outweighed the risk of recurrent toxicity, and after 
consultation with the sponsor 
- 
Initiation of other anticancer therapy 
Patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm received Abraxane at 125 mg/m2 given IV over 
approximately 30 minutes (maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed by gemcitabine 
given at 1000 mg/m2  IV over 30 minutes. 
Patients  in  the  gemcitabine  arm  received  gemcitabine  at  1000  mg/m2  (unless  modification  was 
required) given IV over approximately 30 minutes. The dosing of gemcitabine was chosen based on a 
standard dosing regimen in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of pancreas. 
Patients did not require premedication prior to Abraxane administration as severe hypersensitivity 
reactions were not expected. Antiemetic prophylaxis was recommended due to the administration of 
gemcitabine following Abraxane treatment.  
Erythropoietin and Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors were administered at the discretion of the 
investigator, consistent with institutional guidelines. Ciprofloxacin (or the alternative antibiotic) was 
distributed to patients with instructions to begin treatment immediately if they experienced a febrile 
episode.  Long-term prophylactic ciprofloxacin administration to prevent recurrences in patients who 
had experienced a first febrile episode was allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Prophylactic administration of antibiotics to patients with biliary stents but no complications was 
allowed. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study CA046 was to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Abraxane and 
gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in improving OS in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of 
the pancreas. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
- 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Overall Survival which was defined as the time from the date of 
randomisation to the date of death (from any cause).  
-  Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
•  Progression-free survival 
•  Overall response rate based on CT or MRI scans 
Interpretation of radiological response for use in the PFS and ORR endpoints was completed by 
independent radiological review of CT (or MRI) scans at the centralised facility with radiologic reviewers 
who were blinded to treatment assignment (2 reviewers with a third reviewer for adjudication).    
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 18/63 
  
 
 
 
-  Other secondary (exploratory)  efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Time to response and response duration (duration of response [DOR]) according to RECIST, 
v1.0 
•  Disease control rate (ie, SD for ≥16 weeks or confirmed CR or PR) 
•  Time to treatment failure (TTF) 
•  Changes in serum CA19-9 
•  Tumour response based on PET scans evaluated according to EORTC criteria 
•  Determine whether a correlation exists between ORR based on CT or MRI scans and tumour 
response based on PET scans 
•  Changes in plasma SPARC levels 
•  Determine whether a correlation exists between ORR by CT or MRI scan, tumour response by 
PET scan, changes in serum CA 19-9 and OS 
•  Determine whether correlations exist between ORR by CT or MRI scan, tumour response by 
PET, PFS, OS and expression of tumour markers (eg, SPARC; nucleoside transporters) 
-  Safety/tolerability Endpoints: 
• 
• 
Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) V15.0 terms categorised and graded according to NCI CTCAE V3.0.  
Incidence of dose reductions and interruptions, and incidence of treatment discontinuation and 
reason for discontinuation. 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 842 patients, approximately 421 patients randomised in each treatment 
arm. With at least 608 events, this provided 90% power with two-sided Type I error of 0.049 to reject 
the primary efficacy null hypothesis that the Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine/gemcitabine 
hazard ratio (HR) for OS was equal to 1.0. This sample size calculation assumed that Abraxane in 
combination with gemcitabine would lead to a 30% improvement in OS compared with gemcitabine 
alone (HR=0.769). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The randomisation was stratified to: georgraphic region 
(Australia versus Eastern Europe versus Western Europe versus North America), Karnofsky 
Performance Status (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), presence of liver metastases (yes versus no). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations included the Intention-to-Treat population (ITT, all randomised patients), the 
Treated population (assignment according to drug actually received) and Per-Protocol population (PP, 
eligibility criteria met, same treatment as randomised). 
Interim analysis for futility (i.e. no stopping for efficacy) was planned when at least 200 patients had 
at least 6 months follow-up (total sample size planned 841). An alpha spending function was 
implemented using 0.001 for the interim and 0.049 for the final OS analysis.  
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 19/63 
  
 
 
 
Multiplicity for primary and key secondary endpoints was accounted for at 0.05 (two-sided) by a fixed 
sequence procedure (OS -> PFS -> ORR). 
Time to event endpoints were described by Kaplan-Meier curves and analysed using stratified log-rank 
tests. Median and 95% CI would be provided. 
For OS and PFS, multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of 
several potential prognostic factors (1. all simultaneously, 2. stepwise selection), and a non-stratified 
log-rank test was performed. For OS, an analysis censoring for start new anticancer treatment was 
performed. 
PFS censoring rules were as follows: 
1. Patients who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the date of last 
tumour assessment, on or prior to the clinical cut-off, that the patient was progression free.  
2. Patients who dropped out early without any post baseline tumour assessment and/or died more 
than 120 days after the randomisation were censored on the date of randomisation. 
3. If a patient began a new anti-cancer chemotherapy prior to documented disease progression (or 
death), the patient was censored at the date of last assessment when the patient was documented as 
progression free prior to the intervention. 
4. Patients with two or more consecutive missing response assessments prior to a visit with 
documented progression (or death) were censored at the last date of tumour assessment when the 
patient was documented to be progression free.

Recruitment 
Overall, 861 patients were randomised from 8 May 2009 until 17 April 2012. The study was conducted 
in 11 countries and patients were randomised at a total of 151 sites. The clinical cut-off date was 
17 September 2012.  
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was dated 12 Nov 2008 and was subsequently amended 6 times. The major 
changes were as follows: 
Protocol amendment 1 (20 Mar 2009): Added changes in serum CA19-9 and plasma SPARC levels as 
secondary endpoints; Clarified inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding measurable disease, pain 
symptoms, patients with only locally advanced disease; Added an interim analysis to evaluate futility; 
Clarified the primary efficacy endpoint hypothesis and modified the CI of OS HR to account for the 
interim analysis. 
Protocol amendment 2 (17 Nov 2009): Limited the requirement for PET scans to the first 200 enrolled 
patients; Added and clarified inclusion/ exclusion criteria: a.o. Coumadin use was excluded; Modified 
the statistical procedure for testing the secondary endpoints (PFS and ORR) to a sequential step 
procedure, where PFS was tested first and ORR only if PFS was statistically significant; Clarified dose 
guidelines, the use of CT and MRI to determine disease progression (not PET or CA19-9) and analysis 
population for tumour response by PET scan. 
Protocol amendment 3 (19 Apr 2010): Modified text to allow for additional patients with PET scans to 
be included beyond 200; Clarified inclusion criteria, specifically timeframe for initial diagnosis of 
metastatic disease; Clarified pulmonary embolism discontinuation guidelines to require treatment 
discontinuation for patient with moderate to severe pulmonary embolism. 
Protocol amendment 4 (30 Sep 2010):  Added safety findings related to 8 events of sepsis with or 
without neutropenia and 2 events of febrile neutropenia, including fatal outcome in a total of 4 patients 
with neutropenia; (A directive letter was sent to the investigators on measures to be taken in order to 
prevent and/or minimize the reoccurrence of septic events); Modified the patient sample size 
(increased required number of deaths to at least 608, and enrolled patients to 842) and related 
statistical considerations of the study to allow for an increase in statistical power from 80% to 90% to 
reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment arms, Abraxane in 
combination with gemcitabine and gemcitabine alone, for the primary endpoint of OS;  Collection of 
additional PET scans ceased. 
Protocol amendment 5 (12 Jan 2011): Modified maximum dose delay based upon recommendations 
from the DMC meeting of 15 Nov 2010 regarding dose modification in response to toxicity; Defined 
stratification by geographic region (Australia, Eastern Europe, North American, or Western Europe). 
Protocol amendment 6 (12 Dec 2012): Added the pneumonitis directive measures intended to limit the 
incidence of interstitial pneumonitis through guidance regarding careful pre-study screening, 
continuous on-study monitoring for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and, if observed, timely 
institution of appropriate management, as recommended by the DMC. A copy of the directive letter 
was sent to the investigators; Modified optional distribution to mandatory distribution of ciprofloxacin 
(or the alternative antibiotic) immediately to patients with instructions to begin treatment if they 
experienced a febrile episode. 
In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, 17% of patients had protocol violations, vs. 12% in the gemcitabine 
arm. The most common violation was the inclusion of patients who did not meet all inclusion and

exclusion criteria, which occurred in 7% in both arms. The remainder were dosing errors. The greatest 
difference between the arms was that a larger percentage of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm 
did not reduce the treatment dose in the setting of AEs/toxicity, and had subsequent Grade 3 to 4 AEs 
(8% versus 3% in the gemcitabine arm). In both groups, dosing continued in 1% of patients following 
disease progression.

In terms of other secondary endpoints, the median duration of response was similar in the two 
treatment arms: 11.1 months (95% CI 9.23, 13.11) in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm compared with 
11.4 months (95% CI 9.03, not estimable [NE]) in the gemcitabine arm. The duration of response was 
also calculated from the onset date of CR/PR to the date of PD. Of the patients who had a response, 
39/99 patients (39%) in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 8/31 (26%) patients in the gemcitabine 
arm subsequently had PD based on IRR. The median DOR in this analysis was 8.5 months (95% CI 
7.43, 11.83) in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm compared with 7.9 months (95% CI = 4.67, NE) in the 
gemcitabine arm. 
Overall, 89% of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 94% of patients in the gemcitabine arm 
experienced treatment failure (i.e. patient had PD by IRR, died, or started subsequent anticancer 
therapy). The estimated median time to treatment failure was longer with Abraxane/gemcitabine: 5.1 
months vs. 3.6 months in the gemcitabine arm (HRA+G/G = 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.80]; p <0.0001). 
The disease control rate (percentage of patients with confirmed CR, PR, or SD for ≥16 weeks) was 
higher in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm: 48% compared to the gemcitabine arm: 33%, p < 0.0001. 
A total of 130 patients from the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 127 patients from the gemcitabine 
arm were assessed by PET imaging at baseline and follow-up time-points. The PET scan response rate 
by IRR was significantly higher in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (63%) compared with the 
gemcitabine arm (38%), p < 0.0001. In patients who had a response per PET scan, the median time to 
response was 1.92 months in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm compared with 1.87 months in the 
gemcitabine arm.  
The median time of OS for responders by PET scan (patients with confirmed CR or PR by PET scan) was 
13.1 months (95% CI = 10.51, 14.26) compared with 6.9 months (95% CI = 6.05, 8.15) in non-
responders (patients with SD, PD, or was not-evaluable), p<0.0001. The median time of PFS for 
responders by PET scan was 7.4 month (95% CI = 6.05, 9.23) compared with 3.8 months (95% CI = 
3.65, 4.96) in non-responders, p<0.0001. The concordance rate between CT scan-based response and 
PET scan-based response was 55% in Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 67% in gemcitabine arm.

A total of 281 patients from the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 231 patients from the gemcitabine 
arm were evaluable for CA19-9 assessment (i.e. these patients had a baseline and at least one post-
baseline CA19-9 assessment). A decrease in CA19-9 value post baseline was observed in 85% of 
patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm compared with 77% of patients in the gemcitabine arm. The 
differences between the two treatment groups were larger for subgroups with a higher maximum 
absolute percent decrease from baseline. The largest difference was observed in patients with 
maximum decreases from baseline of ≥90%: this was observed in 42% of patients from the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 22% of patients from the gemcitabine arm, p < 0.0001. 
The correlation of OS and maximum decrease of CA19-9 levels from baseline was evaluated using cut-
offs of maximum decrease at 20%, 50%, 70%, and 90% (pooled across treatment arms). There was a 
clear correlation between OS and decrease in CA19-9 levels from baseline. At each cut-off point, 
patients with a greater decrease in CA19-9 values had longer median survival. Across all cut-off points, 
the reduction in the risk of death was consistently observed with HRs ranging from 0.46 to 0.53, all 
p<0.0001. Significant correlations were also observed using a CA19-9 level of 2000 U/mL (corresponds 
to 59x ULN) or an overall baseline median level of 2469.75 U/mL as cut-off points, although the HRs 
were lower. Similar to the correlation with OS, there was a significant correlation between PFS and 
decrease in CA19-9 levels from baseline using cut-offs of maximum decrease at 20%, 50%, 70%, and 
90%. In contrary to OS, no correlation was observed for PFS using a CA19-9 level of 2000 U/mL or an 
overall baseline median level of CA19-9. 
Tissue and plasma samples for analysis of tissue secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC, or 
osteonectin) were collected in the pivotal study. The plasma samples were collected on day 1 of each 
cycle. Results from the biomarker/pharmacodynamic portion of the study, including the correlation of 
SPARC with OS and PFS, are not yet available and will be reported in a separate stand-alone report. 
Although quality of life (OoL) data were not collected, the pattern of shift in Karnofsky Performance 
Status (KPS) from baseline score to worst post-baseline score was similar between the two treatment 
arms. There was no indication of decrement in performance status in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm 
compared with the gemcitabine arm.

Note:  A stepwise selection with significance level for entry of 0.20 and significance level for stay of 0.10 was used 
to identify potential prognostic factors. 
Note: The Cox proportional hazards model included the following explanatory covariates: treatment groups, age 
(< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), sex, Karnofsky performance status (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), geographic region 
(North America was used as the reference), pancreatic cancer primary location (head versus other), presence of 
biliary stent, previous Whipple procedure, presence of liver metastases, presence of pulmonary metastases, 
peritoneal carcinomatosis, stage of diagnosis (IV versus other), number of metastatic sites, level of CA19-9. 
OS analyses were also performed for the Per-protocol and Treated populations, as well as further 
sensitivity analyses, like a non-stratified analysis. These sensitivity analyses were all consistent with 
the primary analysis and showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with a 26% to 32% 
reduction in the risk of death for the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (data not shown). 
As subsequent anticancer therapy may have an impact on OS, a review was conducted of the use of 
subsequent therapies and a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Overall, the proportion of patients who 
received subsequent anticancer therapy was balanced between the treatment arms: 38% in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 42% in the gemcitabine arm: 26% and 30% of patients in the ABI 
007/gemcitabine arm and gemcitabine arms, respectively, received other 5-FU/capecitabine based 
therapies (excluding FOLFIRINOX); and 4% and 6%, respectively, received modified or unmodified 
FOLFIRINOX. After completing gemcitabine therapy, 25 (7%) patients in the gemcitabine arm crossed 
over to receive ABI 007-containing combination therapy. The sensitivity analysis, which censored 
patients at the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, was consistent with the primary analysis 
with a HRA+G/G of 0.68 and p < 0.0001 indicating that the survival benefit seen in the primary analysis 
was independent of subsequent anticancer therapy (data not shown). 
Similar to OS, the treatment effect on PFS consistently favored the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm across 
the majority of patient subgroups. The only exception was in patients ≥75 years of age, where PFS 
was equivalent between the two treatment arms. Compared with OS data the HR in patients with 
CA19-9 levels within normal range was lower, although the CI crossed 1 (HR 0.80, CI 0.48-1.36 
treatment effect on PFS; HR 1.07, CI 0.69-1.66 treatment effect on OS). 
Finally, the results of multivariate analysis of PFS with adjustment for potential prognostic factors, 
showed a consistent statistically significant treatment effect in the reduction of the risk of PD or death 
for the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm with HRs in the range of 0.66-0.69.

Clinical studies in special populations 
In the pivotal study, 42% of patients were 65 years or older and less than 10% was ≥75 years of age.  
No improvement in OS or PFS was observed for Abraxane/gemcitabine in the patient group ≥75 years 
of age, and there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions that lead 
to study discontinuation. The observed OS HR may have been impacted by confounding factors. The 
small sample size (41 patients ≥75 years of age received Abraxane/gemcitabine, and 49 gemcitabine) 
and high rate of early withdrawal prior to treatment in the gemcitabine arm (10% vs. 0%) may have 
contributed to a lack of precision around the estimate of OS in the gemcitabine arm. Additionally, 
imbalances in baseline characteristics were observed across the treatment arms in this patient group, 
including a number of prognostic factors identified to be predictors of poorer survival. Patients in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm were more likely to have a worse performance status (KPS score of 70-80), 
more extensive disease burden and a higher incidence of liver metastases. 
No separate clinical studies in patients with hepatic or renal impairment were submitted and no data 
are available in children or adolescents under 18 years, and pregnant or lactating women. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The analysis of the efficacy of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was 
based on a single pivotal trial, study CA046 and an uncontrolled, phase I/II dose finding study CA040. 
The pivotal study investigated whether abraxane in combination with gemcitabine improved overall 
survival (OS) compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas. 
The eligibility criteria were standard for advanced pancreatic cancer trials. The study included elderly 
patients with no age restriction, and patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of ≥70. 
The trial was designed to demonstrate superiority in OS for Abraxane/gemcitabine over gemcitabine 
alone. Overall survival as the primary end-point is the preferred end-point in clinical phase 3 cancer 
trials. The main secondary endpoints were investigator assessed PFS, ORR, and DR, which was 
considered acceptable. 
The main study was an open study. This open label design was chosen due to known toxicity 
differences between Abraxane and gemcitabine, and also due to differences in dosing regimens 
between arms. The open design could lead to increased bias; however, blinded independent review on 
statistical analyses by a data monitoring committee (DMC) and independent radiological review on 
progression was performed to reduce this risk.   
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 32/63 
  
 
 
 
 
The choice of gemcitabine as comparator was made on the basis that gemcitabine is a well- 
established treatment in this setting.  
The overall design of the pivotal study, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria, was adequate. 
The distribution of demographics and baseline characteristics, and also other important factors like 
previous malignancy and disease history, were well balanced between arms. A predominance of men 
versus women, and white versus other races was observed. The total number of patients ≥75 years or 
KPS of ≤70 in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm was low (n=41 and n=32, respectively). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the dose-finding study and for both PFS and OS, better results were obtained in the Abraxane 
125 mg/m2 cohort compared to the 100 mg/m2 cohort, while the 150 mg/m2 was not tolerated. The 
difference between the Abraxane 100 mg/m2 cohort and the Abraxane 125 mg/m2 for PFS was small 
(6.1 vs 6.9 months respectively). However, the number of patients included in the 100 mg/m2cohort 
was very limited; therefore, no definitive conclusion regarding the efficacy of this Abraxane dose could 
be drawn. Nevertheless, the choice of 125 mg/m2Abraxane dose for the phase 3 study was supported. 
In the pivotal study, a statistically significant improvement of 1.8 months (8.5 vs. 6.7 months) in 
overall survival (OS) was shown for patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (n=431) vs. 
gemcitabine alone (n=430) (HR=0.72, 95% CI 0.6, 0.8, p<0.001). Approximately 80% of the patients 
had died at time of the final analysis. OS data were supported by several subgroup analyses, although 
no improvement was observed in patients with normal tumour marker CA19-9 levels and patients over 
75 years of age. Results in secondary endpoints supported the efficacy shown for the primary 
endpoint. 
Although the phase I/II dose escalating study included only 44 patients at the proposed dose of 
125 mg/m2 Abraxane, efficacy results supported the beneficial effects observed in the pivotal study. 
The indication initially applied for concerned the treatment of patients with metastatic and patients 
with locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of pancreas. However, patients with locally 
advanced unresectable tumours were excluded from both the CA046 and the CA040 study and the 
indication was subsequently restricted to the treatment of patients with metastatic disease only. Of 
note, in the registration trial of gemcitabine/erlotinib, no improvement in OS was observed for patients 
with locally advanced disease (n=67 in gemcitabine/erlotinib arm), and this regimen has only been 
approved for metastatic pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, gemcitabine monotherapy was 
approved for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma based on a 
phase III study that also included patients with locally advanced disease (n=18).    
In most subgroups the treatment effect favoured the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, with the exceptions 
of patients ≥75 years of age and patients with normal baseline CA19-9 levels where the survival was 
equivalent for the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arms. The HR for the subgroup of patients 
≥75 years of age was 1.08 and therefore negative for the Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment. Although 
these “older” patients accounted for less than 10% of the total patient population (n=41 and n=49 in 
the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arms respectively) and an imbalance in baseline 
characteristics was reported for this patient group, the benefit for the Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment 
in comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy was not demonstrated in this subgroup of patients. As the 
risk of toxicity is also greater in these older patients, a warning regarding the use of 
Abraxane/gemcitabine for the treatment of patients above the age of 75 years was included in the 
SmPC.   
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 33/63 
  
 
 
 
The HRA+G/G, for patients with normal CA19-9 level at baseline was 1.07, thereby no benefit in terms of 
overall survival for this subgroup of patients was demonstrated. This result could not be explained by a 
clear imbalance in post study treatment or baseline characteristics between the study arms, which 
would adversely affect the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm. Although, only a limited number of patients 
with normal CA19-9 levels were included in the study, the lack of data indicating a clear benefit for 
Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment in terms of prolonged overall survival in patients with normal CA19-9 
levels prior to treatment start was reflected in the SmPC. 
Efficacy data for patients with renal and hepatic impairment are lacking, as they were excluded from 
the pivotal study. These data are considered important since patients with hepatic and renal 
impairment represent a relevant subgroup of the population treated in clinical practice. Lack of data in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment was already reflected in the SmPC in the form of insufficient 
information to support relevant posology recommendations and relevant warnings against treating with 
Abraxane patients with severe hepatic impairment and treating with caution patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. Moreover, use in patients with hepatic impairment is considered an 
important potential risk and use in patients with renal impairment considered as missing information in 
the SmPC. 
Some clustering of censoring occurred around the median for OS which could have affected the median 
OS and the PFS analysis has not yet shown to be robust for possibly informative censoring (22% or 
26%). The impact of these censored patients on the OS and PFS has been explored by additional 
sensitivity analysis using the date of observed PD as much as possible (i.e. not censoring for >2 
missed visits and for death after >120 day) and informative reasons for censoring consider as events. 
For OS, a sensitivity analysis was performed were patients were considered to have died if they 
satisfied the criterion of “having a last-known-to-be-alive date more than 1 month earlier than the 
clinical cut-off date”. Furthermore, a conservative analysis was performed were patients satisfying this 
criterion were only considered to have died if they were in the experimental arm. These additional 
analyses confirmed the primary PFS and OS analysis. 
The percentage of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine that had at least one dose reduction or who 
had delayed doses was high in comparison to the number of patients with dose reduction and/or delay 
in the gemcitabine arm and in principle this may affect efficacy. Moreover, the percentage of patients 
with TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug was greater in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (35% for Abraxane and 30% for gemcitabine) than in the gemcitabine arm 
(24%). The need for dose reduction or dose delays and treatment discontinuation could diminish the 
benefit of treatment in a high number of patients. However, additional analysis indicated that for the 
subgroup of patients who needed a dose delay or reduction, the median OS and PFS was longer 
(8 months) for Abraxane/gemcitabine treated patients than for patients treated with gemcitabine 
(6.7 months). Furthermore, the OS for patients of the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm who had dose 
reduction and/or delay seems to be comparable to the OS of the ITT population treated with 
Abraxane/gemcitabine (median OS of 8.5 months). These data suggest that for patients who needed a 
treatment modification due to AEs, dose reduction and/or delay is a reasonable option to allow 
continuation of Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment providing the opportunity to benefit further from 
Abraxane/gemcitabine. 
On the other hand, there was a concern that patients in the gemcitabine alone arm underwent too 
early dose reduction (median time to first reduction 0.9 months vs 1.5 months in the combination arm) 
and too frequent treatment withdrawals (24% is considered higher than expected) by which a bias 
could be introduced, especially as the study CA046 was an open label study. However, additional 
analysis indicated that for the whole study population the moment of first dose reduction or 
interruption in the gemcitabine arm was later than for the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm. Consistently 
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 34/63 
  
 
 
 
with this and as expected, the toxicity profile of the combination was worse than that of gemcitabine 
alone (see discussion on clinical safety). As the OS, PFS and drug exposure data for patients treated 
with gemcitabine monotherapy in the CA046 study were reasonably comparable to results reported for 
earlier (historical) studies, overall there was no suggestion that the patients in the gemcitabine arm 
were undertreated.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The increase of 1.8 months in OS and PFS for the Abraxane/gemcitabine combination therapy in 
comparison to gemcitabine alone in the CA046 study is considered clinically relevant for the treatment 
of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The benefit of Abraxane/gemcitabine 
treatment for patients older than 75 years of age was also demonstrated: however, a warning 
regarding the treatment of patients 75 years and older with the combination treatment 
Abraxane/gemcitabine was included in the SmPC. Moreover, the lack of data indicating a clear benefit 
for Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment in terms of prolonged overall survival in patients with normal 
CA19-9 levels prior to treatment start was also reflected in the SmPC.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Based on experience in the existing Abraxane breast cancer indication the most common Adverse Drug 
Reactions (ADRs) of Abraxane include: bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia), neuropathy (peripheral neuropathy, hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia), 
anorexia and gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, stomatitis), alopecia, 
rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, asthenia and pyrexia. 
The safety and tolerability of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was assessed in two clinical studies (CA040 and CA046). For the 
phase 1/2 study CA040, 67 patients were treated with Abraxane/gemcitabine in the following Abraxane 
dose cohorts: 100 mg/m2  (20 patients), 125 mg/m2 (44 patients) and 150 mg/m2 (3 patients). For 
Study 046, the safety data is derived from the treated population, i.e., all 823 patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug (abraxane/gemcitabine or gemcitabine alone).

In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm of the treated population, the most frequently (≥40% of patient) 
reported TEAEs were fatigue, nausea, peripheral neuropathy SMQ, alopecia, peripheral oedema, 
diarrhoea, anaemia, neutropenia, and pyrexia. The TEAEs reported more often in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm (≥10% difference) in decreasing order were 
fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy SMQ, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, neutropenia, pyrexia, 
decreased appetite, rash and dehydration. 
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs was greater in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the 
gemcitabine arm (89% vs 75%, respectively). The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher TEAEs 
in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm were neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy SMQ, 
thrombocytopenia and anaemia. The Grade 3 or higher TEAES reported more often in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm (≥5%) in decreasing order were neutropenia, 
fatigue, peripheral neuropathy SMQ, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and diarrhoea.

In the pivotal study, the most frequently (≥25% of patients) reported treatment-related AEs in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm were fatigue, alopecia, nausea, neutropenia, anaemia, diarrhoea, 
peripheral oedema, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, decreased appetite, peripheral neuropathy, 
and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  
In the same study, the treatment-related AEs reported more often (≥10% difference) in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than the gemcitabine arm were fatigue, alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhoea, 
peripheral oedema, vomiting, decreased appetite, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, and rash. 
Finally, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher treatment-related TEAEs was 77% in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 50% in the gemcitabine arm. The most frequent (≥10% of) Grade 3 or 
higher treatment-related TEAEs in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm in decreasing order of frequency 
were neutropenia (33%), fatigue (17%), thrombocytopenia (12%) and anemia (10%). The Grade 3 or 
higher treatment-related TEAEs reported with a ≥5% difference in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than 
the gemcitabine arm were neutropenia (33% vs. 21%), fatigue (17% vs. 7%), leukopenia (9% vs. 
4%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (8% vs. 0%), and peripheral neuropathy (8% vs. 0%). 
Adverse events of interest (AEOI) were selected for further review because of their known association 
with Abraxane treatment in patients with other types of cancers, with gemcitabine, or with the 
underlying disease state. 
Categories of AEs of interest included myelosuppression, sepsis, pneumonitis, peripheral neuropathy, 
gastrointestinal events, cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, myalgia and arthralgia, 
hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions/extravasation, cystoid macular oedema, Stevens-
Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, cranial nerve palsies and oedema. 
Myelosuppression AEs were more common in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (66%) than in the 
gemcitabine arm (59%) of pivotal study CA046. The most frequent Preferred Terms (PT) reported were 
anaemia (42% vs. 33%), neutropenia (42% vs. 30%), thrombocytopenia (30% vs. 29%) and 
leukopenia (14% vs. 10%). 
Incidence of bleeding events (all grades) was greater in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (23%) than in 
the gemcitabine arm (13%), primarily due to an increase in the incidences of epistaxis (15% vs. 3%). 
The frequencies of Grade 3 or higher bleeding events were identical in the 2 treatment arms (3% in 
each). Likewise, Grade 3/4 epistaxis was reported for 1 patient in each treatment arm. 
Concomitant therapies to reduce the extent of myelosuppression were more common in the 
combination arm than in the gemcitabine arm of pivotal Study, i.e. WBC growth factors (26% vs. 
15%), erythropoietins (16% vs. 11%), blood transfusions (12% vs. 7%) and blood products (4% vs. 
3%). 
87 MedDRA preferred terms related to sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock, as well as terms 
including bacteraemia with specific organisms, was used to identify sepsis AEs. In the following these 
terms are collectively referred to as sepsis. 
Sepsis was more common in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (5%, n=22) than in the gemcitabine arm 
(2%, n=10). In almost half of the patients (n=11) in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm complications of 
the underlying metastatic pancreatic cancer were a significant contributing factor, most commonly 
being abdominal infection due to cholangitis brought on by tumor compression of the common bile 
duct. No imbalance was found in demographics and cancer history (possible confounders for the risk of 
acquiring sepsis) for patients with sepsis in the two treatment arms. Nearly all cases of sepsis were 
considered to be SAEs, i.e. 5% (n=20) in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 2% (n=9) in the 
gemcitabine arm. 5 patients (1%) in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm died due to sepsis (2 patients had 
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 41/63 
  
 
 
 
sepsis and 1 patient each had bacterial sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, and septic shock) and 2 patients 
(<1%) in the gemcitabine arm died due to a sepsis AE of septic shock. In those who died of sepsis, 
neutropenia was observed in 3 of 5 cases in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 0 of 2 cases in the 
gemcitabine arm. 
Sepsis was also reported for 5 patients in Study CA040 (3 patients in Abraxane 125 
mg/m2/gemcitabine cohort, and 1 patient each in Abraxane 100 mg/m2/gemcitabine cohort and 
Abraxane 150 mg/m2/gemcitabine cohort). The subject in the Abraxane 150 mg/m2/gemcitabine 
cohort died due to sepsis. 
Of the 622 patients enrolled in CA046 up to September 19, 2011, 10 patients had developed interstitial 
pneumonitis, 9 in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (3.0%) of which 3 were fatal, and 1 in the 
gemcitabine arm (0.3%). The median time to onset of pneumonitis AEs was similar in the 2 treatment 
arms (86 days in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 83 days in the gemcitabine arm). 
The incidence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy increased with cumulative exposure to Abraxane. In 
the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, patients received a median of 3 cycles of treatment. For patients 
treated for up to 3 cycles in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, the incidence of Grade 3 peripheral 
neuropathy was 7%. For patients treated for up to 6 cycles in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm the 
incidence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 12%.  
The median time to the first occurrence and improvement in Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy AE was 
longer in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (140 days) than in the gemcitabine arm (113 days). More 
patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm had an improvement by at 
least 1 grade (63% vs 33%), and the median time to improvement by at least 1 grade was shorter in 
the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm (21 versus 29 days). Forty-three percent 
of patients with Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm had an improvement 
to Grade 1 or better, none of the 3 patents with Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the gemcitabine arm 
had an improvement to Grade 1 or better.  
Gastrointestinal AEs were reported for 73% of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 62% in 
the gemcitabine arm in pivotal Study CA046. The most common events were nausea (54% vs. 48%), 
diarrhea (44% vs. 24%) and vomiting (36% vs. 28%). There was a greater incidence of Grade 3 or 
higher AEs in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm (15% vs. 7%). Likewise, 
SAE were more frequent in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (8%) than in the gemcitabine arm (4%) 
and dose reductions due to gastrointestinal AEs were more common in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm 
(5% for Abraxane and 5% for gemcitabine) than in the gemcitabine arm (1%, see Table XXX). 
Cardiotoxicity AEs were reported with a similar incidence in the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine 
arm (5% and 4%, respectively). The most frequently reported cardiotoxicity AE in both treatment 
arms was tachycardia (4% in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 2% in the gemcitabine arm). All 
other cardiotoxicity AEs were reported for ≤1 patient in each treatment arm. Grade 3 or higher 
cardiotoxicity AEs were reported for 2 patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (1 patient with 
intracardiac thrombus and 1 patient with tachycardia) and 2 patients in the gemcitabine arm (1 patient 
with unstable angina and 1 with cardiopulmonary failure). Cardiotoxicity SAEs were reported in 2 
patients in the gemcitabine arm and no cases in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm. 
The incidence of hepatotoxicity AEs was similar in the 2 treatment arms (26% in both). The most 
frequently reported AEs in both treatment arms were alanine aminotransferase increased (11% in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 9% in the gemcitabine arm) and aspartate aminotransferase (9% in 
both arms). Grade 3 or higher hepatotoxicity was reported with similar incidence in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and the gemcitabine arm (11% and 13%, respectively). The percentage of 
patients with hepatotoxicity considered to be a SAE was identical in the 2 treatment arms (4% each)

Renal toxicity, including haemolytic uraemic syndrome, is a known risk for gemcitabine. There was no 
difference between the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arm in the incidence of renal toxicity 
AEs (6% each). The most frequently reported renal toxicity AE in the Abraxane/gemcitabine was blood 
creatinine increased (reported for 3% of patients in each treatment arm). All other renal toxicity AEs 
were reported for ≤1% of patients in both treatment arms. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher renal 
toxicity AEs were similar in the 2 treatment arms (2% in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 3% in the 
gemcitabine arm). The incidence of renal toxicity SAEs was also low and similar in the 2 treatment 
arms (1% and 2%, respectively). 
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome, which is known for gemcitabine, was reported by 2 patients in the 
Abraxane gemcitabine arm and 1 patient in the gemcitabine arm. For all 3 patients with haemolytic 
uraemic syndrome, the event was Grade 3 or higher and was considered a SAE. Study drug (both 
Abraxane and gemcitabine) was discontinued for 1 patient in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm due to 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome. There were no deaths due to haemolytic uraemic syndrome. 
Myalgia and arthralgia AEs were reported more often in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the 
gemcitabine arm (18% versus 6%, respectively). The incidence of Grade 3 myalgia and arthralgia AEs 
was low in both treatment arms (1% versus <1%). 
There were no reports of any hypersensitivity reactions.  
Injection site reaction/extravasation AEs were reported with similar incidence in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arm (3% and 2%, respectively). All injection site 
reaction/extravasation AEs were < Grade 3. 
Cystoid macular edema was reported for 1 patient in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and no patients in 
the gemcitabine arm. The patient was discontinued from study drug (both Abraxane and gemcitabine) 
due to this event. As cystoid macular edema has been described for Abraxane monotherapy, it does 
not represent a new safety signal. 
There were no instances of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis in any of the 
treatment arms. 
Cranial nerve palsy AEs were reported for 2 patients (one Grade 1 facial nerve disorder and one Grade 
2 VIIth nerve paralysis in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and no patient in the gemcitabine arm. The 
events did not result in study drug discontinuation.  
There was a greater incidence of peripheral oedema in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (46%, 3% were 
grade 3) than in the gemcitabine arm (31%, 3% were grade 3). 
Adverse drug reactions (treatment-related AEs) observed in the pivotal and the phase I/II study are 
summarised in the following Table 19.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology and clinical chemistry were assessed at each treatment cycle and summarised using the 
NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grades. The frequencies of patients experiencing grade 1-4 alterations in 
haematological parameters were higher in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm 
for neutropenia (73% vs. 58%) but comparable for anaemia (13% vs. 12%) and thrombocytopenia 
(13% vs. 9%). Concerning clinical chemistry for hepatic and renal functions, the frequencies of 
patients experiencing grade 1-4 alterations were comparable between the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm 
and gemcitabine arm, i.e. alkaline phosphatase (63% vs. 63%), ALT (41% vs. 50%), AST (41% vs. 
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 48/63 
  
 
 
 
 
48%), total bilirubin (6% vs. 14%) and creatinine (9% vs. 14%). Likewise, Grade 3/4 was also 
comparable, i.e. alkaline phosphatase (6% vs. 8%), ALT (1% vs. 2%), AST (2% vs. 1%), total bilirubin 
(2% vs. 3 %) and creatinine (0% vs. 0%). 
Safety in special populations 
There were 174 patients aged ≥65 years in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 175 patients aged ≥65 
years in the gemcitabine arm. 
In general, the incidence and distribution of TEAEs is similar in patients <65 years and ≥65 years of 
age, and similar relationships are observed when comparing the Abraaxane/gemcitabine arm to the 
gemcitabine arm. In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, patients ≥65 years of age had a slightly greater 
incidence (≥10% difference) of diarrhoea (51% and 38%, respectively), decreased appetite (42% and 
32%, respectively), dehydration (26% and 17%, respectively), and epistaxis (22% and 11%, 
respectively) compared with patients <65 years of age.  
In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, patients ≥75 years of age had a greater incidence (≥10% 
difference) of diarrhoea (53% and 43%, respectively), dry mouth (13% and 2%, respectively), 
confusional state (13% and 3% respectively), and hypotension (205 and 8%, respectively) compared 
with patients <75 years of age. For other TEAEs, the rates were comparable or lower than those in 
patients <75 years of age.  
Of the 40 patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm who were ≥75 years of age, 5 patients had AE 
with an outcome of death. Of the 44 patients in the gemcitabine arm who were ≥75 years of age, 2 
patients had AE with an outcome of death. 
In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, more patients ≥75 years of age discontinued treatment due to 
TEAEs compared with the overall Treated population (43% discontinued Abraxane for patients ≥75 
years versus 35% for overall; 38% discontinued gemcitabine versus 30%). In the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, the incidence of Abraxane dose limiting toxicities of peripheral neuropathy 
and neutropenia were comparable among patients ≥75 years compared with the overall Treated 
population. 
In general, the incidence and distribution of TEAEs is similar in male and female patients and similar 
relationships are observed when comparing the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm to the gemcitabine arm. 
The Abraxane/gemcitabine arm, TEAEs reported more often (≥10% difference) in female than male 
patients were neutropenia (49% and 36%, respectively) anaemia (49% and 36%, respectively), 
vomiting (44% and 29%, respectively) and urinary tract infection (17% and 4%, respectively). Cough 
was reported more often in males than females (22% and 11%, respectively). 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar among patients enrolled at sites in the 4 geographic regions 
(North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Australia). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of patients with TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug was 
greater in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (35% for Abraxane and 30% for gemcitabine) than in the 
gemcitabine arm (24%). In the Abraxane arm, the most commonly reported TEAEs resulting in 
abraxane discontinuation were peripheral neuropathy SMQ, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia.

Arm (treated population) 
Post marketing experience 
Abraxane was first authorised in the USA on 7 June 2005 for the treatment of breast cancer in adult 
patients after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically 
contraindicated, In the EU, Abraxane was authorised on 11 January 2008 for the treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in adult patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic 
disease and for whom standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated. As of 6 January 
2013, Abraxane had been approved in 43 countries. An additional indication, for first-line treatment of 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with carboplatin, in 
patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy, was approved in the USA on 
12 October 2012. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety evaluation is based on two studies - pivotal Study CA046 (n=421) performed with the Abraxane 
dose intended for marketing (125 mg/m2 Abraxane) and dose escalating Study CA040. Although the 
125 mg/m2 Abraxane cohort of Study CA040 and the pivotal study used identical treatment regimens, 
the study populations were different rendering inter-study comparison less feasible. Consequently, 
safety assessment is mainly based on the pivotal study. 
In the dose-escalating study, the low tolerance for the 150 mg/m2 Abraxane dose was illustrated by a 
high percentage (67%) of patients who received less than 70% of the protocol-directed dose of 
Abraxane and the high incidence of (serious) AEs.  
The toxicity reported for the 125 mg/m2 Abraxane dose was consistently and substantially higher than 
that for the 100 mg/m2 dose. From the toxicity perspective, the 125 mg/m2 might not be optimal; 
however, the efficacy for the 125 mg/m2 was better than that for the 100 mg/m2. Moreover, the 
number of patients treated with 100 mg/m2 dose is very limited, therefore no definitive conclusions 
regarding the efficacy and toxicity of the 100 mg/m2 dose can be drawn. 
The percentage of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine that had at least one dose reduction or who 
had delayed doses was high (38% for Abraxane and 44% for gemcitabine) in comparison to the 
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 50/63 
  
 
 
 
 
number of patients with dose reduction and/or delay in the gemcitabine arm (31%). Also the 
percentage of patients with an AE that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug was greater 
in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (35% Abraxane and 30% gemcitabine than in the gemcitabine arm 
(24%).  On the other hand, in the pivotal study CA046 the mean duration of treatment was longer in 
the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (145.9 days) than in the gemcitabine arm (111.6 days). Likewise, the 
mean number of cycles administered was higher in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (4.4 cycles) than in 
the gemcitabine arm (3.3 cycles). The unequal treatment durations may subsequently affect the level 
of TEAEs reported in the two treatment arms, which could bring uncertainties to the actual difference 
in safety profiles between the two treatments. 
Most of the reported AE and SAE are already known AE of Abraxane and or gemcitabine, but they were 
reported at higher frequencies than would be expected. In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm the most 
frequent reported AEs were fatigue, nausea, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, peripheral oedema, 
diarrhoea, anaemia, neutropenia, and pyrexia. In patients treated with Abraxane followed by 
gemcitabine, more grade 3 or higher AE were reported, than in patients treated with gemcitabine alone 
(89% vs 75%, respectively). The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher AEs in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm were neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia and 
anaemia. Also the incidence of treatment related serious AEs was higher in the Abraxane/gemcitabine 
arm than in the gemcitabine arm (29% vs 13%). Serious AES that were reported more often in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm were pyrexia and febrile neutropenia, which 
are known AE of Abraxane treatment and the incidence reported in study CA046 was comparable with 
the previously reported incidence for Abraxane. 
The myelotoxicity of Abraxane/gemcitabine was substantially higher in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm 
than in the gemcitabine arm. Also in comparison to the myelotoxicity previously reported for single 
agent Abraxane an increase of haematologic AE was reported for Abraxane/gemcitabine. In 
comparison to the gemcitabine arm, more patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm received G-CSF. 
Also erythropoietins, blood transfusion and blood products were more frequently used for patients 
treated with Abraxane/gemcitabine than for patients treated with gemcitabine. The time to start with 
G-CSF treatment was not significantly different for the two treatment arms (1.22 months in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 0.95 months in the gemcitabine arm). Dose modifications for 
neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia or other identified adverse reactions in the start of a cycle or 
within a cycle of treatment are described under section 4.2 in the SmPC. 
The death incidence due to AEs was similar for both treatment groups (4% each). Fatal events that 
occurred more frequently in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm included 
sepsis and pneumonitis.  
Pneumonitis was reported as SAEs for 3% in patients treated with Abraxane/gemcitabine and 1% in 
patients treated with gemcitabine. Two patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm died due to 
pneumonitis. Hence, Protocol Amendment 6 (12 December 2011) was implemented which gave 
measures intended to limit the incidence of interstitial pneumonitis through guidance regarding careful 
pre-study screening, continuous on-study monitoring for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and, if 
observed, timely institution of appropriate management. Also, patients with a history of slowly 
progressive dyspnoea and unproductive cough, or of conditions such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies was not to be enrolled 
into the study. No pneumonitis events were reported among the 53 patients (25 in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 28 in the gemcitabine arm) enrolled after implementation of 
Amendment 6. Recommendations for careful screening, monitoring for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis and appropriate management information are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 51/63 
  
 
 
 
Sepsis (all grade 3 or higher and reported as SAE) was reported for 5% of patients in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 2% of patients in the gemcitabine arm. Five patients in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm died due to sepsis. During the study additional guidance for monitoring for 
signs and symptoms of sepsis and appropriate management were provided. Also guidance regarding 
the early detection and management of sepsis are included in the SmPC. 
The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was in accordance with the known occurrence of peripheral 
neuropathy due to Abraxane treatment. However, the frequency of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 
considered high in comparison to which was previously reported.  Guidance of management including 
treatment discontinuation is provided in the SmPC.  
Generally the risk on AEs was similar for different subgroups (female/ male, geographic area). 
However, the risk on a fatal event was substantially higher for patients above the age of 75 years than 
for patients younger than 75 years. Moreover, the Abraxane/gemcitabine combination therapy was less 
well tolerated in this patients group. Especially the increased incidence of dehydration was a concern, 
because it was also associated with increased incidence of SAE, dose delays and dose reductions. 
According to the MAH the increased risk can be managed by monitoring the gastrointestinal loss, 
balancing fluid intake and fluid and electrolyte replacement as necessary. However, fluid replacements 
are less well tolerated by elderly. These measures are time- and labour-consuming especially in the 
last phase of life and must be balanced against the obtained benefit. Although, it is acknowledged that 
chronological age alone is not a suitable predictor of patients’ ability to benefit from or tolerate 
chemotherapy, the use of Abraxane/gemcitabine for the treatment of patients ≥75 years of age, 
should be carefully considered having regard to the individual ability to tolerate Abraxane in 
combination with gemcitabine. 
Lack of data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment was already reflected in the SmPC in the form 
of insufficient information to support relevant posology recommendations and relevant warnings 
against treating with Abraxane patients with severe hepatic impairment and treating with caution 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Moreover, use in patients with hepatic impairment 
is considered an important potential risk and use in patients with renal impairment considered as 
missing information in the SmPC. 
Regarding drug interactions, clinical and preclinical studies have sufficiently shown that paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine did not affect each other plasma pharmacokinetics to a significant extent and a clinical 
interaction study between Abraxane and gemcitabine was not considered necessary. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Combined treatment of Abraxane/gemcitabine induced mostly AEs known to be associated with 
gemcitabine and/or Abraxane monotherapy but at higher frequencies. Even though the higher rates of 
AEs are of concern in a palliative setting, the majority of the AEs may be considered manageable. 
Overall, all safety data indicated that the efficacy benefit of Abraxane/gemcitabine was accompanied 
with an increase toxicity profile in comparison to gemcitabine alone. Especially an increased 
myelotoxicity and incidence of sepsis, pneumonitis and pheripheral neuropathy was seen.  For patients 
above the age of 75 years an additional the risk was reported.  Dose modifications in case of 
neutropenia / thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, cutaneous toxicity, 
gastrointestinal toxicity were included in the SmPC. A warning for the combined use of Abraxane and 
gemcitabine in patients ≥75 years of age was also included in the SmPC.

No additional risk minimisation measures are considered necessary beyond the Product Information. 
In the next RMP update the MAH should address the points as provided below: 
• 
Table 43 of the currently submitted updated RMP (part II – Module SVII) needs to be updated. 
It  currently  includes  information  on  the  postmarketing  cases  reporting  an  adverse  event  of 
special 
interest  (i.e.  myeolosuppression,  clinically  severe 
infections  (assessor  NOS), 
dehydration) with a fatal outcome summarized by age group age < 65 years, versus age > 65 
years  versus  age  unknown.  This  postmarketing  information  lacks  the  requested  distinction 
concerning  age  groups,  i.e.  <  75  years  of  age  versus  age  >  75  years  of  age.  Also  the  case 
reports  with  fatal  outcome  in  the  clinical  trials  that  concern  the  elderly  >  75  years  of  age 
versus  case  reports  <  75  years  of  age  with  fatal  outcome  in  the  clinical  trials  with  further 
specification  on  the  administered  therapy  (abraxane  monotherapy,  abraxane  in  combination 
with gemcitabine, otherwise) are still missing. 
• 
• 
In part II – Module SVII of the updated RMP the MAH added detailed information on the dosing 
modifications  at  the  identified  risk  ‘Myeolosuppression’  in  line  with  MAH’s  currently  SmPC-
proposal. As of next RMP-update the MAH is requested to include a more general reference to 
the  appropriate  section  of  the  SmPC  valid  at  that  date  instead  of  a  copy  of  the  literal  text  of 
the SmPC to limit the number of RMP-updates in future in case of SmPC-updates. 
Part  VI  of  the  RMP  (Summary  for  the  public)  should  be  amended  to  include  the  risks  on 
anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Currently from the risk on bone marrow suppression only the 
risk on neutropenia and leukopenia is addressed. 
In the next PSUR the MAH should address the following points: 
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 56/63 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The MAH should ensure to closely monitor all reported adverse events in patients > 75 years of 
age  and  review  and  discuss  these  in  PSURs,  and  not  limit  the  review  in  the  PSURs  to  the 
MedDRA terms as mentioned in this table 43 of the RMP version 13.0. 
The  MAH  should  submit  a  detailed  review  and  discussion  on  all  reported  cases  of  acute  renal 
failure  and  haemolytic-uremic  syndrome  (HUS)  received  in  the  clinical  trials  of  Abraxane 
monotherapy,  as  well  as  received  post-marketing.  If  appropriate  section  4.8  (undesirable 
effects)  of  the  proposed  SmPC  should  be  amended  to  include  acute  renal  failure  and 
haemolytic-uremic  syndrome  (HUS)  as  an  ADR  of  Abraxane  in  general  instead  of  the  current 
proposal to only include these ADRs applicable for the combination Abraxane/gemcitabine. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Specifically, the following indication was agreed: 
Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 
i.e. the indication was restricted to patients with metastatic disease as discussion previously. 
Moreover, posology recommendations and information on dose adjustments in patients with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma were added to section 4.2. Information on patients 75 years and older was added to 
the same section, as well as a relevant warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
In the same section, warnings on neuropathy and pneumonitis were amended and, particularly, new 
warnings on sepsis, patients with normal CA19-9 at baseline and co-administration with erlotinib (as 
well as patients 75 years and older) were added.  
Section 4.5 was amended to inform of the absence of expected or shown interactions between 
Abraxane and gemcitabine. Finally, sections 4.8 and 5.1 were amended to include information on 
adverse drug reactions expected from the combination of Abraxane and gemcitabine in pancreatic 
cancer patients and with information from the pivotal trial, respectively.  
The Package Leaflet was amended accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments to sections 2, 4.2, 4.3, 
4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 7 of the SmPC, to the Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
following grounds: 
•  No significant changes to the design and layout from the approved package leaflet were 
proposed; 
•  No significant changes to the key messages for safe use of the product are proposed.  
The justification submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
The median OS of patients treated with Abraxane/gemcitabine proved to be significantly longer than 
for patients treated with gemcitabine alone (8.5 months vs 6.7 months respectively, resulting in a 
HRA+G/G of 0.72 [95%CI 0.671, 0.835]). Also a prolongation of 1.8 months in median PFS was 
observed for Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment in comparison to gemcitabine alone (5.5 vs 3.7 months 
respectively, resulting in a HRA+G/G of 0.69 [95% CI 0.581, 0.821]). Furthermore, the percentage of 
ITT patients with a confirmed BOR (CR + PR) was significantly higher for the Abraxane/gemcitabine 
arm than for the gemcitabine arm (23% vs 7%, p<0.0001).   
The results of most other secondary endpoints (such as change in target lesion diameter, disease 
control rate, time to treatment failure) were in line with the results of the primary endpoint.  The 
remaining secondary endpoints at least exclude a diminished efficacy of Abraxane/gemcitabine in 
comparison to gemcitabine alone.   
The increase of OS, PFS and response rate was consistently found in most of the pre-specified 
subgroup analyses. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The increase of OS, PFS and response rate was consistently found in most of the pre-specified 
subgroups. Only for patients with an age of 75 years and older, the HRA+G/G was not in favour of the 
combination therapy (HR=1.08). Although an imbalance in baseline characteristics between the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and the gemcitabine arm was reported for these patients, it was considered 
that a beneficial effect of combination treatment in comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy was not 
obviously demonstrated. This was reflected in the SmPC and caution before use in these patients was 
recommended. 
Furthermore, the HRA+G/G, for patients with normal CA19-9 level at baseline was 1.07, thereby no 
benefit in terms of overall survival for this subgroup of patients was demonstrated. This result could 
not be explained by a clear imbalance in post study treatment or baseline characteristics between the 
study arms, which would adversely affect the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm. Although only a limited 
number of patients with normal CA19-9 levels were included in the study,  the lack of data indicating a 
clear benefit for Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment  in terms of prolonged overall survival in patients 
with normal CA19-9 levels prior to treatment start was reflected in the SmPC.  
Both in the primary OS and in the PFS analysis a large percentage of patients were censored for the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (23% and 36%, respectively). Some clustering of censoring occured 
around the median for OS which could have affected the results. However, additional sensitivity and 
conservative analyses confirmed the positive results for the combination treatment seen in the primary 
analysis, thus addressing this concern. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Combined treatment of Abraxane/gemcitabine induced AEs known to be associated with gemcitabine 
and/or Abraxane monotherapy, but at higher frequencies. The most common AEs in the combination 
arm of pivotal Study CA046 were fatigue (59%), nausea (54%), peripheral neuropathy SMQ (54 %) 
and alopecia (50%). 
Abraxane 
EMA/CHMP/627629/2013 
Page 58/63 
  
 
 
 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were frequent in both the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (89 %) and the 
gemcitabine arm (75 %) of the pivotal study, the most frequent being neutropenia (33% vs. 21%), 
fatigue (18% vs. 9%), peripheral neuropathy SMQ (17 % vs. 1%), thrombocytopenia (13% vs. 8%) 
and anaemia (12% vs. 8%). 
SAEs were more common in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (50%) than in the gemcitabine arm (43%) 
of pivotal Study CA046. The SAEs that occurred at ≥2% higher frequency in the Abraxane/gemcitabine 
arm than in the gemcitabine arm were pyrexia (6% vs. 2%) and febrile neutropenia (3% vs. <1%). 
Several adverse events of interest (AEoI) in pivotal Study CA046 were observed at higher frequencies 
in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm than in the gemcitabine arm; of particular importance were 
gastrointestinal AEs (73% vs. 62%), myelosuppression (66% vs. 59%), sepsis (5% vs. 2%), 
pneumonitis (4% vs. 1%) and peripheral neuropathy (54% vs. 13%). Other AEoI were reported at 
comparable levels, i.e. cardiotoxicity (5% vs.4%), hepatotoxicity (26% vs. 26%) and renal toxicity 
(6% vs. 6%), and hence, appeared not to represent additional safety concerns. 
Death rates due to SAEs were similar in both treatment arms (4%). However, more subjects died due 
to treatment related SAE in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (n=7) than in the gemcitabine arm (n=2). 
In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm 3/7 deaths were due to sepsis and 2/7 due to pneumonitis. 
In the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm of pivotal Study CA046 a substantially higher frequency of SAEs was 
observed in patients ≥75 years (75%) than in those <75 years (48%). In contrary, in the gemcitabine 
arm SAEs were observed at comparable levels for patients ≥75 years (48%) and <75 years (42%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Co-administration of Abraxane and gemcitabine induced more AEs than gemcitabine monotherapy. 
This was reflected in a higher frequency of dose reductions in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (38% for 
Abraxane and 44% for gemcitabine) than in the gemcitabine arm (31%). In addition, study drug 
discontinuation was more frequent in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (35% for Abraxane and 30% for 
gemcitabine) than in the gemcitabine arm (24%). On the other hand, in the pivotal Study CA046 the 
mean duration of treatment was longer in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (145.9 days) than in the 
gemcitabine arm (111.6 days). Likewise, the mean number of cycles administered was higher in the 
Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (4.4 cycles) than in the gemcitabine arm (3.3 cycles). The unequal 
treatment durations might have subsequently affected the level of TEAEs reported in the two treatment 
arms, which could bring uncertainties as to the actual difference in safety profiles between the two 
treatments. However, this uncertainty was not considered to significantly affect the safety results and 
the confidence in the conclusions made from them. 
The safety profile of Abraxane/gemcitabine was of concern in older patients. Due to the higher 
frequencies of SAEs observed in patients ≥75 years receiving Abraxane/gemcitabine, the 
appropriateness of treatment in this subgroup is questionable. Moreover, only a small number of 
patients ≥75 years [Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (n=40), gemcitabine arm (n=44)] was included in the 
pivotal Study CA046, bringing additional uncertainty to the safety profile in this subgroup. Relevant 
posology recommendations and warnings have been included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC, 
respectively.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Single agent gemcitabine is the current standard of care, but the pivotal study CA046 indicated that 
the addition of Abraxane to gemcitabine can improve OS with 1.8 months in patients with metastatic 
pancreas carcinoma. This benefit was supported by several sensitivity analyses and secondary 
endpoints and it is considered clinically relevant. 
Overall, all safety data indicated that the efficacy benefit of Abraxane/gemcitabine is accompanied with 
increased toxicity in comparison to gemcitabine alone. Particularly, increased myelotoxicity and 
incidence of sepsis, pneumonitis and peripheral neuropathy was seen, as is known to occur during 
treatment with Abraxane in other indications.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The prognosis for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma who are ineligible for surgery, including 
those with advanced or metastatic disease is poor, and the range of available treatment options is 
limited. Gemcitabine has been the standard drug therapy for first line treatment of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma. Although gemcitabine was well tolerated, median OS remained less than 6 months in 
metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. Other chemotherapy combinations failed to achieve 
improvement in OS over three weeks or were accompanied by increased toxicity, limiting the number 
of patients that can actually use these therapy regimens. A new chemotherapy regimen showing 
substantial improvement in OS with acceptable toxicity would therefore be of benefit to patients with 
advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
The benefit of the Abraxane/gemcitabine treatment in comparison to the gemcitabine monotherapy in 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer is considered clinically relevant and of significant benefit to 
a patient population with generally very short OS and for whom only few treatment options are 
available. 
As expected on the basis of its safety profile, the increase of toxicity by adding Abraxane to 
gemcitabine is substantial, by which treatment is only feasible for patients with a good performance 
status and good prognosis. However, the AEs including the serious AEs due to Abraxane/gemcitabine 
treatment were generally well manageable with dose reductions, delays, treatment discontinuation 
and/or supportive care.  
Thus, in general the benefit/risk balance is considered positive but the use of Abraxane in metastatic 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients above the age of 75 should be carefully considered taken into 
account the individual patient characteristics and additional risk factors. Moreover, no clear benefit in 
terms of prolonged overall survival has been demonstrated in patients with normal CA19-9 levels prior 
to treatment start. These uncertainties and warnings were reflected in the SmPC.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification 
of an approved one 
Type 
II 
Extension of Indication to include new indication for Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine for the 
first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated in order to: 
provide posology recommendations and dose adjustment information, add warnings on sepsis, co-
administration with erlotinib, patients with normal CA19-9 at baseline and patients 75 years and older, 
amend existing warnings on neuropathy and pneumonitis, inform of the absence of expected or shown 
interactions between Abraxane and gemcitabine, include information on adverse drug reactions 
expected from the combination of Abraxane and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer patients and include 
information from the pivotal trial to the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments throughout the Product 
Information. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
Additional data exclusivity /market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

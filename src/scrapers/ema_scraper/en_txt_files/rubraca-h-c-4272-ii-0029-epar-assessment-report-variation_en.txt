Update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) based on final 
results from study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4); this is a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of rucaparib versus chemotherapy for treatment of relapsed ovarian 
cancer listed as a specific obligation in the Annex II; the Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. The 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 6.1 has also been submitted. With this variation application, the 
MAH requests for the Rubraca marketing authorisation to no longer be subject to specific obligations. The 
SmPC, Annex II and PL are updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
minor editorial changes and bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2 Rev.1. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the RMP. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Background 
On 24 May 2018, Rubraca obtained a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for the monotherapy 
treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline 
and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC), or primary 
peritoneal cancer (PPC), who have been treated with 2 or more prior lines of platinum based 
chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. This authorisation 
was based on pooled population subgroup data from two Phase 2 open label studies (Study CO 338 010 
[Study 10] and Study CO 338 017 [ARIEL2]), which included adult patients with ovarian cancer who 
received 2 or more previous lines of chemotherapy and whose tumours had a deleterious mutation (germ 
line or somatic) in BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
Submission of results from study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) was imposed as a specific obligation (SOB) 
during the initial CMA assessment to further confirm the safety and efficacy of rucaparib in the treatment 
of platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/ or somatic), high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, as included in Annex II.  
Through the current application, the MAH submitted the (initial) Clinical Study Report (CSR) of ARIEL 4 
including the primary analysis to fulfil the outstanding SOB and requested conversion from CMA to a 
Marketing Authorisation not subject to SOBs, based on the confirmation of rucaparib efficacy and safety 
in the comparative, randomized, Phase 3 Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4).  
Initially, no request was made by the MAH to update the current indication wording on the basis of the 
results from study CO-338-043.

In view of the reported results from the ARIEL4 study (see details below), the European Commission (EC) 
initiated on 22 April 2022 in parallel to this variation EMEA/H/C/004272/II/0029, a procedure under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033) and requested the CHMP 
to assess all the concerns and their impact on the B/R balance of Rubraca (rucaparib) in the “treatment” 
indication (i.e. “as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or 
progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based 
chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy”).  
At the April 2022 CHMP plenary meeting, based on the available data, the Committee agreed as a 
temporary measure that no new treatment with Rubraca should be initiated in adult patients with 
platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more 
prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum-based 
chemotherapy. CHMP also agreed to communicate this temporary restriction to healthcare professionals 
through a direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC), together with a communication plan. The 
content of the letter was published on the EMA website on 06 May 2022.  
On 9 June 2022 the MAH sent a notification to request the removal of the “treatment” indication (as 
defined above) from the Product Information. This (voluntary) request followed the MAH’s decision to no 
longer market Rubraca in the third line treatment indication justified on the basis that “most ovarian 
cancer patients that receive a PARP inhibitor do so earlier as a maintenance therapy after first or second-
line chemotherapy”. The request to remove the treatment indication was acknowledged and considered 
necessary following confirmation, in the context of the above-mentioned procedure under Article 20 of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, that the benefit/risk of Rubraca in the “treatment” indication was no longer 
considered favourable.  
More concretely, on 21 July 2022 the CHMP adopted an opinion pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for Rubraca. The 
Committee concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Rubraca in the treatment indication is negative. 
Therefore, this product should only be used as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. Reference 
is made to procedure EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033 for further details. A further DHPC was agreed by 
CHMP and sent to relevant healthcare professionals. The content of the letter was published on the EMA 
website on 8 August 2022.  
Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) 
Study ARIEL 4 showed a benefit for rucaparib, compared with standard chemotherapy, in terms of 
progression free survival (PFS), as assessed by the investigator in the Efficacy Population (all randomized 
excluding patients with a BRCA reversion mutation). A hazard ratio (HR) of 0.639 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.489, 0.835]; p=0.0010 was reported with a median invPFS of 7.4 months (95% CI: 7.3, 
9.1) for the rucaparib group compared to 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.5, 7.3) for the chemotherapy group. 
Results for the secondary endpoints objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, duration of response 
(DOR), ORR by RECIST 1.1 and/or cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) response and patient reported outcome 
(PRO) (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 
(EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status score) were also numerically higher for rucaparib but failed to be 
statistically significant based on the planned hierarchical step-down testing procedure. Other (‘stand-
alone’) secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and PFS as assessed by a blinded independent 
committee review (BICR) (though the latter has not been tested).  
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 8/234 
 
 
 
 
The initially available OS data (based on an interim analysis (IA)) clearly favoured the chemotherapy 
treatment over rucaparib (HR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.085, 2.214).  
During the procedure, results from the final OS analysis (DCO 10 April 2022) were provided. OS results in 
the ITT population of Study ARIEL 4 were consistent with the IA and although not statistically significant, 
clearly favoured the chemotherapy treatment over rucaparib (HR=1.31; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.73; p=0.0507). 
The observed detrimental effect on OS was driven by results in the platinum resistant subgroup in which 
the worst results were observed (HR 1.51; [95% CI: 1.05, 2.17]; p=0.0251) representing 51% of the 
patient population. The HR for OS in the other subgroups of fully platinum sensitive and partially platinum 
sensitive were 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62, 2.50] (p=0.5405) and 0.97 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.62] (p=0.9129), 
respectively, which are not considered reassuring. 
For PFS2 in all populations, no difference was observed between the rucaparib and chemotherapy arms. 
In terms of safety, rucaparib treatment was associated with more SAEs compared to chemotherapy, such 
as Grade 3 or higher AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to death, and AEs leading to study drug interruptions 
or study drug dose reduction compared to the chemotherapy control arm. 
The most common AEs in the rucaparib group were combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased, nausea, 
combined asthenia/fatigue/lethargy, combined alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 or higher TEAEs in the 
rucaparib group were combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased and combined neutropaenia/decreased 
ANC. SAEs in the rucaparib group were mostly caused by myelosuppression from anaemia/decreased 
haemoglobin. Intestinal obstruction and death were observed at a higher frequency in the rucaparib 
group compared to the chemotherapy group and were most often leading to study drug discontinuation 
with rucaparib treatment. Several concerns were also related to the timing of deaths due to progression, 
AEs or other causes, which could not be alleviated by the MAH during the procedure. 
Results from study ARIEL4 were expected to confirm the efficacy (and safety) of rucaparib evidenced in a 
pooled analyses from two single arm trials (Study CO 338 010 and Study CO 338 017) that supported the 
initial conditional authorisation of Rubraca (rucaparib) in the “treatment” indication. 
Despite a statistically significant gain in terms of invPFS reported in the study, a detrimental effect of 
rucaparib on OS compared with the chemotherapy control was observed within the interim and final data 
analyses of the study. 
The subgroup of platinum sensitive patients of the study, particularly those partially sensitive, 
represented the most relevant population to confirm the benefit-risk balance of rucaparib in the approved 
“treatment” indication. However, and albeit the limitations to extract from the study definitive conclusions 
from subgroups’ data in the platinum sensitive populations, results on OS were not considered reassuring 
as explained above. 
The MAH claimed the findings were the result of the crossover of patients from the control arm to 
rucaparib following disease progression, which was allowed for all patients irrespective of their platinum-
sensitivity status. In this context, the MAH provided results from several sensitivity analyses. However, 
despite non-negative OS results were observed in some of these analyses, concerns remain in terms of 
the methods used in said analyses, which relied on strong assumptions, and which did not allow to rule 
out a detrimental effect on OS. 
Further, convincing evidence to support that the detrimental effect on OS could be specifically considered 
related to platinum resistant disease is not available. Hence, it is not possible to exclude a detrimental 
effect in other subgroups including platinum sensitive patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 9/234 
 
 
 
 
The detriment in OS could also not be fully explained as PFS2 curves overlap and timing of deaths, either 
due to underlying disease, adverse events or other causes is unknown. 
Moreover, the subgroup of study patients with platinum-sensitive disease included in the study was not 
identical to the approved “treatment” indication (platinum-sensitive patients who are unable to tolerate 
further platinum-based therapy) since part of the patients in the study received platinum therapy either 
as control or subsequent therapy. This hampered interpretation of the OS results of the study by 
subsequent platinum therapy in all platinum-sensitivity subgroups. Importantly, additional data provided 
during the procedure did not alleviate the concern that the OS detriment may also be applicable for the 
“treatment” indication as approved for Rubraca. 
Regarding safety aspects, uncertainties remained in connection with the timing of deaths due to 
progression, AEs or other causes. It was thus unclear how far AEs or related aspects (e.g. 
discontinuations, treatment interruptions) contributed to the observed OS detriment. 
In light of the above, further data/analyses, including OS data from the ongoing ARIEL 3 study in the 
maintenance setting, were also requested. The submitted results from the ARIEL 3 study did not raise 
concern on a potential detrimental effect on OS and therefore the “maintenance” indication (i.e. “as 
monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) 
to platinum-based chemotherapy”) was not subject to further questions in the context of this procedure. 
A CSR addendum of ARIEL 3 will be provided in 3Q 2022 (see Annex II condition, PAES).  
All in all, it remained unclear whether the OS detriment observed in ARIEL 4 was caused by a safety 
issue, a lack of efficacy or a combination of both. Thus, major concerns remained regarding a potential 
detrimental effect of rucaparib on OS compared to chemotherapy in the specific patient population 
covered by the “treatment” indication.  
Furthermore, the MAH did not provide the requested data and/or further arguments aimed at trying to 
address the above mentioned outstanding uncertainties and therefore the SOB could not be considered 
fullfiled.  
Therefore, it was concluded as part of procedure EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033 that the benefit/risk of 
Rubraca in the ‘treatment’ indication can no longer be considered favourable. The indication of Rubraca 
was restricted to the maintenance treatment as monotherapy for adult patients with platinum-sensitive 
relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy and that the product information should be 
amended accordingly. 
As a result of the removal of the ‘treatment’ indication implemented as part of EMEA/H/A-
20/1518/C/4272/0033, and considering the ‘maintenance’ indication is not subject to any specific 
obligation, the CHMP is of the view that there are no remaining grounds for the marketing authorisation 
to remain conditional. Therefore, the CHMP recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation no 
longer subject to specific obligations in accordance with Article 14-a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
and the deletion of the specific obligation from Annex II can be agreed. The product information and risk 
management have been updated accordingly. 
The CHMP recommends that the MAH provides the final CSR for study ARIEL 4 (CO-338-043) including 
final PFS2 and OS analyses as well as safety data.  
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of SmPC have been adequately updated to reflect safety data from study ARIEL 4 
and from the updated Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population (N=1169). Of note, intestinal obstruction 
has been included as a new ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC and a warning has been added to section 4.4 
of the SmPC.  
Assessment report

Page 10/234 
 
 
 
 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 6.2 with changes to the safety concerns and removal of the 
“treatment” indication, which is considered acceptable (see section 9). 
The benefit/risk of Rubraca remains positive in the maintenance indication.

data 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC based on safety data from study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4); this 
is a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rucaparib 
versus chemotherapy for treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer listed as a specific obligation in the Annex 
II; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 6.2 is acceptable.  
Update of Annex II to remove the specific obligation. The SmPC and Package leaflet are amended 
accordingly to reflect the conversion from a conditional marketing authorisation to a marketing 
authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations as recommended by the CHMP as a result of this 
variation and further to the removal of the indication for monotherapy treatment of adult patients with 
platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more 
prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based 
chemotherapy (EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make

5.  Introduction 
Rucaparib (CO-338) is a small molecule inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) being developed for the treatment of cancer associated with homologous 
recombination deficiency (HRD). Rucaparib has been shown to inhibit PARP-1, PARP 2, and PARP-3 and 
has demonstrated activity in cells, animal models, and patients with a breast cancer gene BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutation in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
On 24 May 2018, a CMA was granted for the monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum 
sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), who have been 
treated with 2 or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate 
further platinum based chemotherapy. This authorisation was based on pooled population subgroup data 
from 2 Phase 2 open label studies (Study CO 338 010 [Study 10] and Study CO 338 017 [ARIEL2]), 
which included adult patients with ovarian cancer who received 2 or more previous lines of chemotherapy 
and whose tumours had a deleterious mutation (germ line or somatic) in BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
The initial CMA was granted subject to a Specific Obligation (SOB) (also referred below as SOB001), 
pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004: “In order to further confirm the safety and 
efficacy of rucaparib in the treatment of platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germ 
line and/ or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, the MAH 
should submit the results of study CO 338-043 (ARIEL4), a phase 3, multicentre, open label, randomised 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rucaparib versus chemotherapy for treatment of relapsed 
ovarian cancer”, with due date Q2 2023, as included in Annex II. 
On 23 January 2019, the indication was subsequently extended, via variation procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004272/II/0001, to include maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive 
relapsed high-grade EOC, FTC, or PPC who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based 
chemotherapy. This approval was based on data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 study, Study CO 338-014 (ARIEL3). 
Through this application, the MAH initially requested conversion from a CMA to a Full Marketing 
Authorization not subject to SOBs, based on the confirmation of rucaparib efficacy and safety in the 
comparative, randomized, Phase 3 Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) without a modification of the existing 
indications. However during the procedure and following the triggering of an Article 20 referral 
(EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033), the MAH requested to remove the indication for Rubraca as 
monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated 
(germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, 
who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable 
to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy (see section 2 above). 
In addition, safety data provided within this submission include results from patients treated with 
rucaparib in Study CO-338-043 (N=232) and the updated Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population 
(N=1169) which integrates the last data-cuts from Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-017 and CO-338-014

6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) is an ongoing phase 3, multicenter, randomized study of rucaparib versus 
chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, BRCA-mutant, high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer (table 2).

Patients were stratified based on the time to progression following the last dose of platinum containing 
therapy: platinum-resistant (PF I ≥1 to <6 months); partially platinum sensitive (PFI ≥6 to <12 months); 
and platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥12 months).  
The study consisted of a Screening Phase, Randomization (2:1 rucaparib: chemotherapy), Treatment 
Part, and Post-treatment Phase/Cross-over Part. Patients initially randomized to chemotherapy had the 
option to cross over to rucaparib treatment following progression in the Treatment Part, with sponsor 
approval and additional consent (Figure 1).

•  Treatments 
Following confirmation of eligibility in the Screening Phase, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 
rucaparib or active standard-of-care chemotherapy comparator in the Treatment Phase. 
Rucaparib was administered at an initial dosage of 600 mg BID. This starting dosage of 600 mg BID 
rucaparib was selected as the recommended dose for Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies based on safety, 
tolerability, overall PK, and the efficacy profile observed in Study CO-338-010 (Study 10), which 
evaluated monotherapy rucaparib in patients with advanced solid tumours. This dosage is the currently 
approved dosage for marketing authorization in the US and EU for the treatment and maintenance 
treatment of ovarian cancer. Patients could take rucaparib with or without food. Each dose was to be 
taken with at least 240 mL of water. Tablets were to be swallowed whole without crushing or chewing. 
Each treatment cycle is 28 days. Treatment with rucaparib should be held or reduced in case of toxicity 
(Table 3), following established criteria and recording each modification. 
Table 3. Rucaparib Dose Reduction Steps 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 18/234 
 
 
 
 
In the control arm, patients could receive different Chemotherapy regimens grouped by platinum-
sensitivity: 
-  Platinum-resistant and partially platinum-sensitive patients received weekly paclitaxel, at a 
starting dose of 60-80 mg/m2 (per institution protocols), administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 
28-day cycle, up to 8 cycles. 
-  Platinum-sensitive patients received, by investigator choice, platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) 
monotherapy or platinum-based doublet (carboplatin and paclitaxel, carboplatin and gemcitabine, 
or cisplatin and gemcitabine), up to 8 cycles. Dosing should follow local guidelines. 
Patients initially randomized to chemotherapy have the option to cross over to rucaparib treatment 
upon radiologic disease progression with Sponsor (or designee) approval of the radiology report 
confirming disease progression, signed consent for crossover, and meeting eligibility for the crossover. 
Initiation of treatment with rucaparib should occur within 8 weeks following radiologic disease 
progression.

•  Outcomes/Endpoints 
Primary endpoint: invPFS (i.e. investigator assessed progression free survival) for the Treatment Part, 
was defined as the time (months) from randomization to disease progression +1 day, as determined by 
RECIST v1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients without a documented 
event of progression (or death) were censored on the date of their last tumour radiologic assessment or 
date of randomization if no post-baseline tumour assessments had been performed. 
Secondary endpoints for the Treatment Part were part of the hierarchical step-down procedure 
included: 
•  ORR by RECIST 1.1: assessed by investigator and analyzed in the subgroup of patients who were 
response evaluable at baseline for both the Efficacy Population and the ITT Population. The ORR 
was defined as proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or PR by RECIST v1.1. The confirmed 
response was defined as a CR or PR on subsequent tumour assessment at least 28 days after first 
response documentation. 
•  DOR by RECIST 1.1: was measured from the date of the first response until the first date that PD 
was documented. Any patients with an ongoing response were censored at the date of the last 
post-baseline scan. 
•  ORR by RECIST 1.1 and/or CA-125 response. Patients evaluable for CA-125 response must 
have had a baseline CA-125 value at least twice the upper limit of normal (ULN; i.e., ≥ 70 IU/mL) 
and at least 2 post baseline values. The endpoint of CA-125 response rate was defined as a 50% 
reduction from baseline. The response needed to be confirmed in a subsequent sample collected 
≥21 days after the prior sample. The value of this confirmatory sample must have been ≤ 110% 
of the prior sample. The date when the first sample with a 50% decrease from baseline was 
observed was considered the date of the CA-125 response. In patients who had measurable 
disease by RECIST v1.1, the date of response was the date of the earlier of the two events. 
•  PRO as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status score: change from baseline 
during the first 6 treatment cycles. 
Stand-alone secondary endpoints for the Treatment Part of the study outside of the step-down procedure 
were as follows: 
•  PFS by BICR 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 20/234 
 
 
 
 
• 
Interim OS: the time to OS was calculated in months as the time from randomization to date of 
death due to any cause. Patients who were still alive were censored on the date of their last 
available visit or last date known to be alive. 
•  PRO as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OV28 
Exploratory endpoints: 
•  PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to the second event of disease progression as 
assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause. This second event of PFS could be a 
documented event per RECIST v1.1 or could be an event of symptomatic progression. Patients 
without a second event of progression (or death) were censored on the last date the patient was 
known to be alive, study visit, or on the date of randomization if no post-baseline visits had been 
performed. 
•  DCR: defined as RECIST v1.1 evaluation of CR, PR, or SD ≥ 12 weeks and SD ≥ 24 weeks as 
assessed by the investigator. 
•  PRO as assessed by the EQ-5D-3L Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
•  Sample size 
Approximately 345 patients were planned to be randomized 2:1 to receive either rucaparib or 
chemotherapy. The median PFS was assumed to be 12 months for rucaparib and 8 months for the 
comparator. Assuming an accrual over about 3 years, a dropout rate of 2%, a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65, 
and at least 275 events, a sample size of 345 patients (230 patients randomized to rucaparib and 115 
patients randomized to chemotherapy) would yield at least 80% power at a two-sided 0.05 significance 
level. 
•  Analysis populations 
The following analysis populations are defined for the treatment part of the study: 
•  Efficacy population: all randomized patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation, excluding those 
identified to have a BRCA reversion mutation 
• 
ITT population: all randomized patients 
•  Safety population: patients who received, at least, one dose of protocol-specified treatment 
The crossover part will only be summarized for the Safety population, which is defined as all patients who 
crossed over to rucaparib treatment and received, at least, one dose of rucaparib. 
•  Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses will be performed both in the Efficacy Population and in the ITT Population. The 
primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints will be tested using a hierarchical step-down procedure 
starting with the primary efficacy endpoint in the Efficacy Population then testing the primary endpoint for 
the ITT Population. 
The primary endpoint of invPFS was analyzed using the stratified Cox proportional hazard methodology. 
The stratified HR from the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the HR between the 
randomized treatment groups. Subgroup analyses were also conducted for the primary endpoint in the 
Treatment Part using age group (< 65, 65-74, ≥ 75), race (White, non-White), and randomization strata 
(platinum-resistant, partially platinum-sensitive, platinum-sensitive). In addition, subgroups based on 
BRCA mutation status (germ line or somatic BRCA), mutated gene (BRCA1, BRCA2), and detection of a 
BRCA reversion are presented as part of exploratory endpoint. Sensitivity analyses for the primary 
endpoint were performed to evaluate the impact of censored patients. A sensitivity analysis of invPFS was 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 21/234 
 
 
 
 
performed using the randomization strata of platinum status (platinum-resistant, partially platinum-
sensitive, platinum-sensitive) based on the prior anticancer data reported. 
If the primary endpoint is statistically significant, then the secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested 
in the order specified below where for each endpoint, first in the Efficacy Population, and then in the ITT 
Population (Figure 2). In order to preserve the overall interim error rate, statistical significance will only 
be declared for the secondary endpoints, listed below, if the primary endpoint and previous secondary 
endpoints are also statistically significant: 
•  ORR 
•  DOR 
•  ORR and CA-125 response 
• 
PRO as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status score 
Figure 2. Ordered Step-down Procedure 
ORR by RECIST Version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator: The proportion of responders will be 
analyzed using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. Duration of response will be summarized 
and analyzed using the same methodology as described for the primary endpoint. Regarding ORR and CA-
125 response, the proportion of responders will be analyzed using a stratified chi-square test. For PRO 
scores, at a given visit, the change from baseline will be compared between the randomized treatment 
groups using an ANCOVA using the treatment and stratification variable as a categorical factor and 
baseline measurement for the parameter as a continuous covariate. 
OS will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazard methodology. The stratified hazard ratio from the Cox 
proportional hazards model will be used to estimate the HR between the randomized treatment groups. It 
was anticipated that the data for OS would be heavily censored at the time of the initial CSR analysis. In 
order to adjust for multiple analyses of OS at a later stage, a stopping rule will be applied. The Haybittle-
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 22/234 
 
 
 
 
 
Peto stopping rule will be applied where an OS result with a p-value < 0.001 can be used to claim 
superiority of rucaparib compared to chemotherapy. This means that a p-value < 0.05 can be utilized at 
the final analysis which is projected to be once 70% of the death events have been collected. 
No formal interim efficacy analyses were planned but ongoing review of data was performed by the IDMC.  
6.2.  Results 
o  Participant flow 
A total of 930 patients were screened. Of them, 349 were randomized. Of the patients who failed 
screening, the majority (464 patients) were ineligible due to lack of a deleterious BRCA mutation. First 
patient was enrolled on 1 March 2017 and last one on 24 September 2020. 
Up to the visit cut-off date (30-Sep-2020), the 349 eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 
rucaparib (N=233) or chemotherapy (N=116). Four patients were randomized and discontinued prior to 
receiving any study drug (1 patient randomized to the rucaparib group, 3 patients to the chemotherapy 
group); therefore, the Safety Population consisted of 345 patients, 232 of whom initiated treatment with 
600 mg BID of rucaparib and 113 of whom initiated chemotherapy treatment. A flow diagram illustrating 
this is presented in Figure 3.

For the ITT population, end-of-study status included 2.1% and 3.4% of patients lost to follow-up, 2.6% 
and 1.7% of patients withdrawing consent, 54.1% and 44.0% patient deaths, and 18.9% and 4.3% of 
patients ongoing with treatment in the rucaparib and chemotherapy groups, respectively. As of the visit 
cut-off date, there were 51 patients (21.9%) in the rucaparib group and 24 patients (20.7%) in the 
chemotherapy group who were ongoing in long-term follow-up (alive) and continue to be followed for OS 
(Table 4).

o  Conduct of the Study 
Original protocol is dated on 15-Jun-2016. A first amendment to the original protocol was issued on 11-
Jan-2018. In this updated version, PFS by RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Independent Radiology Review 
(irrPFS) was included as the key secondary endpoint, first to be tested, followed by OS and, then, the rest 
of endpoints presented in this report. 
By Amendment 2, dated 23-Oct-2020, irrPFS and OS were removed from the hierarchical step down 
testing procedure and they are included as stand-alone secondary endpoints, in the current protocol 
version. 
In addition, Amendment 2 re-defined the population of analyses and established Efficacy Population 
(excluding patients with a BRCA reversion mutation) as the primary efficacy analysis population and ITT 
Population to be tested, for each endpoint, if the first one was statistically significant. An extract of the 
Summary of Changes provided by the MAH is included as figure 4.

Regarding protocol deviations, up to the data cut-off date, a total of 30 patients (30 of 349 [8.6%]) had 
major protocol deviations (Table 5). Of the 7 inclusion/exclusion criteria violations, 5 were in patients 
randomized to the chemotherapy group. The 13 violations for initiating treatment more than 3 days after 
randomization ranged from 4 to 10 days post-randomization, with 10 of the violations occurring in 
patients randomized to the rucaparib group.

patient was excluded from Efficacy Population due to non-BRCA status; this patient was randomized 
based on a local laboratory result, and subsequent verification of the laboratory data indicated that the 
BRCA mutation was not deleterious (and this was confirmed by central laboratory testing). Overall, these 
deviations did not seem to have an impact on the study results. 
o  Baseline data 
Demographic data for the ITT population are summarized in Table 6. The demographic characteristics 
of both treatment groups were well balanced. All patients were female. The overall median age was 58.0 
years (range: 38-85 years), with the majority in each treatment group younger than 65 years (81.1% 
rucaparib; 75.9% chemotherapy), and the median BMI was 27.7 kg/m2 overall. Nearly all patients in 
either treatment group were White (94.0% rucaparib; 97.4% chemotherapy), reflective of the countries 
of recruitment. Patients were enrolled from 12 countries, with treatment groups well balanced for each

country. The majority of patients were from central or eastern Europe. In accordance with the study 
inclusion criteria, all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (56.4% total) or 1 (43.6%) at 
baseline, and 80.2% overall had never smoked.

Regarding disease characteristics, a summary of disease burden for the ITT Population is presented in 
Table 7. Disease burden was considered similar between treatment groups. Most patients had measurable 
disease at baseline per the investigator (96.1% rucaparib, 91.4% chemotherapy), with a mean (± StD) of 
2 target lesions (± 1) in the rucaparib group and 2 (± 1) in the chemotherapy group. The mean (StD) 
sum of the diameters of target lesions was also similar: rucaparib, 65.9 mm (± 48.96); chemotherapy, 
74.2 mm (± 48.32).

Nearly all patients had epithelial ovarian cancer (94.4% rucaparib; 95.7% chemotherapy), with the 
remainder approximately evenly split between fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer, and most 
patients had serous histology (89.3% rucaparib; 90.5% chemotherapy) (table 8).  
In accordance with the study inclusion criteria, the histology was high-grade in all patients, and the 
majority of patients had been initially diagnosed with extensive disease with International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IIIC (58.4% rucaparib; 62.9% chemotherapy) and FIGO Stage 
IV (15.0% rucaparib; 10.3% chemotherapy). The median time since cancer diagnosis was 43.1 months in 
the overall population, which was similar for both treatment groups, with the majority of patients having 
been diagnosed > 24 months prior to enrolment (88.4% rucaparib; 87.1% chemotherapy).

Both treatment groups had the same number of prior chemotherapy treatments: median 2.0, range 2-9 
rucaparib, 2-6 chemotherapy. As specified in Inclusion Criterion 4, all patients received ≥ 2 prior 
chemotherapy regimens, with most having received 2 (57.9% overall) or 3 regimens (24.6% overall). All 
patients also had at least 1 prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen, with a median or 2 prior 
platinum regimens in both treatment groups (range 1-6 rucaparib; 1-5 chemotherapy). The majority of 
patients had 2 (65.9%) or 3 (21.8%) prior platinum regimens with 0 (77.7% or 1 (19.5%) intervening 
non-platinum chemotherapy regimens. 
Enrolled patients had a mean (StD) PFI of 8.3 (9.2) months following the last platinum-containing 
therapy regimen received. The 2:1 randomization of rucaparib and chemotherapy was stratified by PFI; 
however, there were no design restrictions on how many patients could enrol from each PFI stratum 
group. t (Table 9).

A summary of BRCA mutation status (local and central laboratory testing) is presented for the ITT 
population in Table 10. The majority (74.5%) of patients in the ITT Population were identified to have a 
BRCA1 gene mutation, with a BRCA2 gene mutation identified in 25.2% of patients. One patient 
randomized to the chemotherapy group had non-BRCA status (0.3%) due to an error in the interpretation 
of the local result; this patient was included in all efficacy analyses for ITT population and all safety 
analyses but was excluded from the Efficacy Population.  
The majority of patients had germ line BRCA mutation status, identified in 84.0% and 84.6% of patients 
in the ITT Population and Efficacy Population, respectively. A somatic BRCA mutation was seen in 15.5% 
and 15.1% of patients in the ITT Population and Efficacy Population, respectively. Mutated BRCA gene 
and germ line vs. somatic mutation status were well balanced between the rucaparib and chemotherapy 
treatment groups. In addition, a BRCA reversion mutation was identified in 6.6% (23 patients) of patient 
samples. These 23 patients, along with the 1 patient with non-BRCA status, were excluded from the 
Efficacy Population.

o  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
invPFS 
The primary efficacy endpoint was invPFS using RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any cause, with a 
hierarchical step-down analysis from the Efficacy Population (if significant) to the ITT Population. 
In the Efficacy Population, the stratified Cox proportional hazard methodology showed a statistically 
significant improvement in invPFS with rucaparib treatment compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.639 
[95% CI, 0.489-0.835]; p=0.0010). 
Investigator-assessed PFS was also estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method (figure 5) and the stratified 
log-rank test was used to compare invPFS between the rucaparib and chemotherapy treatment groups. 
The median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 7.3-9.1) for the rucaparib group compared to 5.7 months 
(95% CI, 5.5-7.3) for the chemotherapy group.

Page 34/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the ITT Population (second step of the multiplicity procedure), similar results were reported, with a 
statistically significant improvement in invPFS in the rucaparib treatment group compared with 
chemotherapy. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model showed a statistically significant improvement 
in invPFS with rucaparib treatment compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.516-0.858]; 
p=0.0017). Results from the stratified log-rank analysis of invPFS (figure 6) were consistent with the 
stratified Cox proportional methodology, showing a statistically significant difference in invPFS with 
rucaparib treatment over chemotherapy (stratified log-rank, p=0.0016) for the ITT Population. The 
median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.7-7.9) for the rucaparib group and 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-
6.7) for the chemotherapy group.

Sensitivity analyses 
Prespecified sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint of invPFS were performed to evaluate the 
impact of censored patients, on both the ITT Population and the Efficacy Population. 
• 
In the first sensitivity analysis, all scans were included for assessment of PFS, regardless of whether 
they were taken, including after the start of subsequent anticancer therapy. The results were similar 
to the primary efficacy analysis described above for the respective populations, indicating that the 
censoring rules implemented for the primary analysis had minimal impact on the evaluation of 
invPFS. For the Efficacy Population, the median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 7.3-9.1) for the 
rucaparib group and 5.8 months (95% CI, 5.5-7.3) for the chemotherapy group; p = 0.0019. For the 
ITT Population, the median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.7-8.0) for the rucaparib group and 5.7 
months (95% CI, 5.5-7.3) for the chemotherapy group, p=0.0029. Consistent with the primary 
efficacy analysis of these populations, the stratified Cox proportional hazard model showed a

statistically significant improvement in invPFS with rucaparib treatment compared with chemotherapy 
in both the Efficacy (figure 7) and ITT (figure 8) Populations: HR 0.660 (95% CI, 0.507-0.858), 
p=0.0020 and HR 0.685 (95% CI, 0.553-0.880), p=0.0031.

• 
The second sensitivity analysis included patients who discontinued treatment in the randomized 
Treatment Part due to clinical progression or withdrew consent (considered as events of invPFS on the 
date of the last dose of study drug). The results were similar to the primary efficacy analysis 
described above for these analysis populations, indicating that the inclusion of clinical progression or 
withdrew consent as an event of disease progression did not impact the evaluation of invPFS. For the 
Efficacy Population, the median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 7.2-8.0) for the rucaparib group 
and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1-6.7) for the chemotherapy group, log-rank p=0.0005. For the ITT 
Population, the median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.0-7.5) for the rucaparib group and 5.6 
months (95% CI, 4.0-5.8) for the chemotherapy group, log-rank p=0.0010. Consistent with the 
primary analysis of these population, the stratified Cox proportional hazard model showed a 
statistically significant improvement in invPFS with rucaparib treatment compared to chemotherapy in 
both the Efficacy (figure 9) and ITT (figure 10) Populations, respectively: HR 0.633 (95% CI, 0.487-
0.822); p=0.0006 and HR 0.660 (95% CI, 0.515-0.847); p=0.0011.

•  A third sensitivity analysis of invPFS was performed using the final data entered into eCRF for PFI 
strata, as some patients were allocated incorrectly by the site at the time of randomization. There 
were 14 patients who were allocated incorrectly, 1 patient in the chemotherapy group and 13 patients 
in the rucaparib group, as follows: 3 patients (all rucaparib) who were partially platinum-sensitive on 
the CRF but randomized to platinum-resistant; 5 patients (1 chemotherapy and 4 rucaparib) who 
were partially platinum-sensitive but randomized to fully platinum-sensitive; and 6 patients (all 
rucaparib) who were platinum-resistant but randomized to partially platinum-sensitive. As shown in 
figure 11, invPFS using actual strata data were consistent with the initial analysis, showing a 
significant benefit with rucaparib treatment compared to chemotherapy (log-rank, p=0.0010). 
Analysis using the stratified Cox proportional hazard model also showed consistent benefit of 
rucaparib for PFS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.642, 95% CI 0.491, 0.838), p=0.0011, when 
actual strata allocation was used.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
ORR 
The first secondary endpoint as part of the step-down multiple comparison procedure was ORR for the 
Efficacy Population in the Treatment Part in the subgroup of patients who were response evaluable at 
baseline (i.e., had measurable target lesions). ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a 
confirmed CR or PR by RECIST v1.1. The response rates between treatment groups were compared using 
the stratified CMH test, and are summarized for the Efficacy Population in the Treatment Part is shown in 
Table 11. A higher confirmed response rate was observed in the rucaparib group (40.3%, 95% CI 33.6%-
47.2%) as compared to the chemotherapy group (32.3%, 95% CI 23.1%-42.6%), however this 
difference was not statistically significant (p=0.1287). There were 4.7% of patients in the rucaparib group 
who achieved a CR compared to 2.1% in the chemotherapy group.

Per the ordered step-down procedure, because statistical significance was not achieved for ORR in the 
Efficacy Population, statistical significance could not be claimed for the subsequent secondary endpoint 
analyses but they are displayed for descriptive purposes. 
The next step of the multiplicity procedure was ORR as assessed in the ITT Population for patients with 
measurable disease at baseline (Treatment Part), as summarized in Table 12. Similar results were 
observed, with a confirmed response rate in the rucaparib treatment group of 37.9% (95% CI, 31.6%-
44.7%) compared to 30.2% (95% CI, 21.7%-39.9%) in the chemotherapy group.

DOR 
The next step of the multiplicity procedure was DOR as assessed by investigator, analyzed sequentially in 
the Efficacy and ITT Populations in the subgroup of patients who had a confirmed response (CR or PR) by 
RECIST v1.1. DOR was measured from the date of the first response until the date that progressive 
disease was documented. Similar results were seen for both populations, showing a longer duration of 
response in the rucaparib group compared to the chemotherapy group. For the Efficacy Population, the 
DOR was 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.5-11.1) for the rucaparib group, compared to 7.2 months (95% CI, 4.0-
11.4) in the chemotherapy group. For the ITT Population, DOR was 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.5-11.1) for 
the rucaparib group, compared to 7.2 months (95% CI, 3.9-9.4) in the chemotherapy group. 
ORR and/or CA-125 response 
The next step of the multiplicity procedure was ORR by RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator and/or 
CA-125 response, analyzed sequentially in the Efficacy and ITT Populations in the subgroup of patients 
who were response evaluable at baseline (i.e., had measurable target lesions) or CA-125 response 
evaluable. The endpoint of CA-125 response rate was defined as a 50% reduction from baseline. The 
response needed to be confirmed in a subsequent sample collected ≥ 21 days after the prior sample with 
the confirmatory sample ≤110% of the prior sample. 
The proportion of patients with a confirmed RECIST v1.1 response and/or CA-125 response are 
summarized for the Efficacy Population in Table 13, followed by the ITT Population in Table 14 for the 
Treatment Part. For the Efficacy Population, 50.7% of patients in the rucaparib group (95% CI 43.8%-
57.5%) had a confirmed response by either measure compared to 43.6% of patients in the chemotherapy 
group (95% CI 33.7%-53.8%). For the ITT Population, 47.8% of patients in the rucaparib group (95% CI 
41.2% - 54.5%) had a confirmed response by either measure compared to 40.5% of patients in the 
chemotherapy group (95% CI 31.3%-50.3%).

The last step-down analysis performed was PRO as measured by European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 Global Health Status Score, which 
integrates functional and symptom scoring results. Changes from baseline of this score over the first 6 
cycles in the treatment part were analyzed. Results for the Efficacy Population and ITT Population are 
shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, respectively and show no difference in QOL as assessed by EORTC 
QLQ-C30 Global health status score between treatment groups. Overall, Global Health Status per the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument appears similar in patients in the rucaparib group as compared to patients in 
the chemotherapy group.

PFS by BICR 
The PFS by BICR was included as a secondary endpoint outside of the step-down procedure in the SAP. 
According to the MAH, as this analysis was not required, by the SAP, at the time of the primary efficacy 
analysis, it was not performed. 
Interim OS 
At the time of visit cut-off, OS data were at 51% maturity (51% of events), with the final readout for OS 
planned per the SAP when 70% maturity has been reached. Thus, the interim analysis submitted is 
considered exploratory, with the final OS analysis to be submitted when complete, in an addendum to the 
CSR. 
Patients who were still alive at the time of this IA were censored on the date of their last available visit or 
last date known to be alive. The preliminary, exploratory interim OS analyses were performed for the 
Efficacy Population and ITT Population for patients randomized to the Treatment Part. 
For patients treated with rucaparib in the Efficacy Population, the median OS was 19.6 months (95% CI, 
16.8-24.0) in the rucaparib group compared to 27.1 months (95% CI, 22.2-38.1) in the chemotherapy 
group; stratified log-rank, p=0.0138 (figure 14). Similar results were seen for the ITT Population, where 
the median OS was 18.8 months (95% CI, 14.6-22.9) for the rucaparib group compared to 25.9 months 
(95% CI, 21.7-33.3) for chemotherapy group stratified log-rank p=0.0162 (figure 15). Results using the 
stratified Cox proportional hazard model are as follows: HR 1.550 (95% CI, 1.085-2.214), p=0.0161 for 
the Efficacy Population  and HR 1.484 (95% CI, 1.069-2.061), p=0.0185 for the ITT Population.

The platinum-resistant subgroup was more mature (77.6% [139/179]) than the platinum-sensitive 
subgroup, which had 61.8% (105/170) OS events and was comprised of the PPS (69.8% [67/96]) and

Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
PFS2 
At the time of the visit cut-off for this report, the PFS2 data had reached 60.9% maturity in the rucaparib 
group (134 of 220 patients with an event) and 67.6% maturity in the chemotherapy group (71 of 105 
patients with an event). A final PFS2 analysis will be conducted when final OS data are available. 
Of note, the second event of progression could be due to progression per RECIST v1.1 or symptomatic 
progression. 
In the Efficacy Population (Figure 18), the median PFS2 was 15.2 months (95% CI, 12.9-18.2) for the 
rucaparib group compared to 14.2 months (95% CI, 12.7-16.8) for the chemotherapy group, stratified 
log rank, p=0.5029. Similarly, no difference was seen in the ITT Population (Figure 19) for PFS2 between 
treatment groups, with a median PFS2 of 14.4 months (95% CI, 12.0-17.2) for the rucaparib group 
compared to 14.0 months (95% CI, 11.3-16.0) for the chemotherapy group, stratified log rank, 
p=0.5887. There was no significant reduction in the risk of a second event of progression or death in the 
rucaparib group compared to the chemotherapy group in either the Efficacy Population (HR 0.903 [95% 
CI, 0.676-1.207]; p = 0.4897) or the ITT Population (HR 0.925 [95% CI, 0.703-1.216]; p = 0.5761).

difference between rucaparib treatment and chemotherapy treatment for PFS2 in either the Efficacy 
Population or ITT Population in the final analysis.

DCR 
For the Efficacy Population, DCR was 66.4% in the rucaparib group (n=211; 95% CI, 59.5%- 72.7%) 
compared to 59.4% in the chemotherapy group (n = 96; 95% CI, 48.9%-69.3%), though this difference 
was not statistically significant (p=0.2057). A similar result was seen in the ITT Population: 63.4% (95% 
CI, 56.7%-69.7%) in the rucaparib group compared to 58.5% (95% CI, 48.5%-68.0%) in the 
chemotherapy group, p=0.3573. 
PRO by EQ-5D 
In the Efficacy Population, the EQ-5D-3L VAS scores remained relatively constant or slightly improved 
over time for both treatment groups. At baseline, the mean VAS score (± StD) was 68.9 (18.41) in the 
rucaparib group (n=204) and 67.7 (20.09) in the chemotherapy group (n=95). The mean VAS score for 
last value on treatment prior to the cut-off was 63.9 (20.75) in the rucaparib group and 65.7 (18.87), 
with the difference from chemotherapy in the rucaparib group (LS ± SE) being -2.1 (2.23, 95% CI, -6.5 
to 2.3, p=0.3576). 
Efficacy in BRCA mutation groups 
The primary endpoint was further analyzed in relation to BRCA status as an exploratory endpoint using 
treatment-by-BRCA mutation type variable in the model (with treatment and BRCA mutation type as 
interaction terms). 
As seen by the stratified Cox proportional hazard model (Table 15), the treatment effects across 
subgroups by gene (BRCA1, BRCA2) or mutation type were similar and not significant compared to the 
effect of study treatment on PFS. In contrast, a difference in treatment effect was seen for the BRCA 
reversion mutation. While the BRCA reversion mutation itself did not predict PFS (p=0.5123), it did affect

PFS in the context of response to study treatment between those with versus without BRCA reversion

  Efficacy during the crossover part 
As explained above, patients in the chemotherapy arm who had evidence of disease progression were 
allowed to cross over to receive treatment with rucaparib in the Crossover Part of the study. Patients 
were re-baselined and assessed for invPFS, ORR, DCR and CA-125 response prior to starting rucaparib in 
the crossover part. 
A total of 74/116 (64%) patients randomized to chemotherapy opted to cross over and receive rucaparib 
as of the visit cut-off date (30-Sept-2020). Of these patients, 67 were included in the efficacy analysis: 
the 7 patients excluded included 6 patients with a BRCA reversion mutation and 1 patient with non-BRCA 
status.

InvPFS (Crossover Part) 
As shown in Figure 20 for the Efficacy Population, results were similar to those for the rucaparib group in 
the Treatment Part: the median invPFS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.6-9.5) for the Safety Population and 
7.5 months (95% CI, 6.3-9.6) for the Efficacy Population in the Crossover Part, compared to 7.4 months 
(95% CI, 7.3-9.1) and 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.7-7.9) for the rucaparib group in the Efficacy and ITT 
Populations, respectively, in the Treatment Part.

ORR (Crossover Part) 
ORR was analyzed in the crossover part for patients with measurable disease at baseline. Results for the 
Efficacy Population are shown on table 16. A confirmed response of CR or PR was observed in 35.9% of 
patients in the Efficacy Population.

DCR (Crossover Part) 
DCR for the Efficacy Population in the Crossover Part was 73.4% (95% CI, 60.9%-83.7%). Of note, DCR 
for the Efficacy Population in the Treatment Part was 66.4% for the rucaparib arm. 
ORR and/or CA-125 response (Crossover Part) 
ORR by RECIST v1.1 and/or CA-125 was analyzed for patients treated with rucaparib in the Crossover 
Part, for those patients with measurable disease and/or CA-125 response evaluable at crossover baseline. 
Results are summarized in Table 17 (Efficacy Population).

The primary efficacy endpoint of invPFS was analyzed by subgroup by randomization strata, age and 
race, for the Efficacy Population, as follows:

By age (<65, 65-74; ≥75 years) 
By race (white, other race; unknown)

sensitive 
invPFS by Age 
In the Efficacy Population, patients in the <65 years (N=259) and 65-74 years (N=58) age groups 
showed a benefit from treatment with rucaparib compared to chemotherapy: stratified log-rank 
p=0.0144, median PFS of 7.4 (95% CI; 7.2, 5.8) months for rucaparib arm (N=181), 5.8 (95% CI; 5.5, 
7.4) months for chemotherapy arm (N=78); and log-rank p=0.0048, median PFS of 10.5 (95% CI; 6.4, 
14.6) months for rucaparib (N=33) and 4.1 (95% CI; 1.9, 7.6) months for chemotherapy arm (N=25), 
respectively. Nearly all of the patients in this study were in these age groups (97.5% in the Efficacy 
Population). For the remaining 8 patients 75 years or older (2.5%), median PFS was higher in the 
chemotherapy group (7.4 vs. 13.9 months), though this result was not statistically significant (log-rank 
p=0.9182). This subgroup was too small to reach any conclusion. 
invPFS by Race 
In the Efficacy Population, patients in the White race subgroup (N=308) showed a significant benefit with 
rucaparib treatment compared to chemotherapy (log-rank p=0.0007), with most patients in this study of 
White race (94.8% in the Efficacy Population). In non-White patients (Other Race) in the Efficacy 
Population, benefit was seen with rucaparib, though patient numbers were small, and the results are not 
significant (log-rank p=0.8084). 
invPFS by Randomization Strata 
As shown in Table 18, a benefit in PFS was seen in the Efficacy Population with rucaparib treatment as 
compared to chemotherapy in all of the randomization strata subgroups (platinum-sensitive, partially 
platinum-sensitive, and platinum-resistant). Patients in the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup (PFI ≥6 
months to <12 months after last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy) (log-rank p=0.0002) had a 
statistically significant increase in median PFS in the rucaparib group of 8.0 months as compared to 5.5 
months in the chemotherapy group (Figure 21). This platinum status subgroup comprised approximately 
one-third of the patients in this study.

As shown in table 18, patients in the platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive randomization strata also 
showed a trend toward longer PFS with rucaparib treatment compared to chemotherapy, but results did 
not reach statistical significance.

The Cox proportional hazard model showed similar results, with a significant benefit in PFS with rucaparib 
treatment compared with chemotherapy treatment in the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup (ITT 
Population): HR 0.410 (95% CI, 0.256-0.659; p=0.0002). There was a similar trend toward longer PFS 
with rucaparib treatment compared to chemotherapy in the platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive 
subgroups, but results did not reach statistical significance (Figure 22).

The Cox proportional hazard model of subgroup analysis of invPFS by randomization strata in the ITT 
Population for Partially Platinum Sensitive and Platinum Sensitive resulted in a estimated HR of 0.502 
(95% CI; 0.343, 0.733), p-value=0.0004. 
ORR by Platinum Sensitivity Status 
An additional analysis was performed for ORR by platinum sensitivity status comparing rucaparib to the 
chemotherapy group, although it was not prespecified in the SAP. 
Similar results were seen in both the Efficacy and ITT Populations in the 3 platinum sensitivity subgroups 
(table 19). Partially platinum-sensitive patients showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR 
when treated with rucaparib compared to chemotherapy (Treatment Part with measurable disease at 
baseline): 53.3% in the rucaparib group compared to 20.0% in the chemotherapy group in the Efficacy 
Population (p=0.0050); 50.8% vs. 21.4% in the ITT Population (p=0.0091). The ORR was comparable for 
rucaparib and chemotherapy in both the platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant subgroups, though 
results did not reach statistical significance. Over half of platinum-sensitive patients achieved a confirmed 
response following treatment with either rucaparib or chemotherapy, and approximately one-quarter of 
patients in the platinum-resistant subgroup achieved a confirmed response to either treatment.

Subgroup Analysis by BRCA Mutation 
The invPFS was further explored based on mutated BRCA gene and mutation status, as follows: 
1.  Mutated gene: BRCA1, BRCA2 
2.  Mutation status: germ line, somatic 
3.  BRCA reversion mutation 
The invPFS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method; the median invPFS and stratified log-rank p-
value are presented for the BRCA gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2), BRCA mutation status (germ line or somatic), 
and BRCA reversion mutation subgroups in Table 20.  
In the Efficacy Population, rucaparib prolonged invPFS compared to chemotherapy in the BRCA1, BRCA2, 
germ line, and somatic mutation subgroups, each subgroup reaching statistical significance except for the 
somatic mutation subgroup: log-rank p=0.0129 (BRCA1), log-rank p = 0.0152 (BRCA2), log-rank 
p=0.0005 (germ line), log-rank p=0.2857 (somatic). In contrast, in the ITT Population, patients in the 
BRCA reversion subgroup, treatment with chemotherapy showed increased benefit compared to rucaparib 
(log-rank p=0.0301).

-  Analyses performed across studies 
As introduced at the beginning of this report, the efficacy of rucaparib was initially investigated in 106 
patients based on a pooled efficacy population from 2 multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical studies, 
Studies CO-338-010 and and CO-338-017, in patients with advanced BRCA-mutant EOC, FTC or PPC who 
had progressed after 2 or more prior chemotherapies (the primary efficacy population). As a result of this 
assessment, a CMA was granted in 2018 and the already ongoing Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) was 
selected to provide confirmation of the positive benefit-risk of rucaparib in this setting. 
The baseline characteristics of the patient population included in ARIEL 4 are considered comparable to 
those from the pooled efficacy population assessed in the initial application. The median age of rucaparib-
treated patients in Study CO-338-043 was 58 years (range, 38-81) versus 59 years (range, 33-84) in 
Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017. The majority of patients were White (94% versus 78%), and had 
an ECOG performance status of 0 (54% versus 61%) or 1 (46% versus 39%). The median time since 
cancer diagnosis was 43 months (range, 13-185) in rucaparib-treated patients in Study CO-338-043 
versus 52 months (range, 6-197) in Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017; 42.5% (versus 61.8%) had 
received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy, and 57.5% (versus 38.7%) had received 2 prior lines of 
chemotherapy. The median PFI was 5.6 months (range, 1.1-67.4) versus 7.9 months (range, -0.7-
116.4). 
Study CO-338-043 included a similar proportion of rucaparib-treated patients in the randomization 
stratum of platinum-sensitive (PFI >12 months) compared with the pooled efficacy population of Studies 
CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 with PFI >12 months (20.6% versus 22.6%). While there were fewer 
patients in the randomization stratum of partially platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥6 -12 months) in Study CO-
338-043 than patients with PFI ≥6 -12 months in Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 (27.9% versus 
51.9%), and a higher proportion of patients in the randomization stratum of platinum-resistant (PFI ≥1 to 
<6 months) in Study CO-338-043 than patients with PFI <6 months in Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-
017 (51.5% versus 25.5%), the proportion of patients from the combined randomization strata of 
platinum-sensitive (PFI >12 months) and partially platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥6-12 months) represented 
half of the patients in Study CO-338-043, and matches the population in the approved treatment 
indication. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 was ORR as assessed by the 
investigator according to RECIST version 1.1. An analysis of PFS was also performed although comparison 
of the results is difficult to interpret due to the single-arm design of these studies. A tabular comparison 
of efficacy data is displayed below (Table 21):

In order to compare more directly against data supporting the currently approved treatment indication, 
ORR, DOR, and PFS in Study CO-338-043 were analyzed for the platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥6 months) 
patients in the ITT population in Table 22, combining the patients from randomization strata: platinum-
sensitive (PFI >12 months) and partially platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥6-12 months). In the platinum-
sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) population in Study CO-338-043, the ORR by investigator review was 56.1% 
(95% CI, 46.1-65.7) versus 64.6% (95% CI, 53.0-75.0) in the platinum-sensitive pooled efficacy 
population from Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 (SmPC, Section 5.1), with a median DOR of 9.4 
months (95% CI, 7.4-11.1) versus 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.4-12.9; SmPC, Section 5.1).

According to the MAH, the results from Study CO-338-043 in the platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥6 months) 
population were consistent with, and provide confirmation of the pooled efficacy data from Studies CO-
338-010 and CO-338-017, that formed the basis of the conditional approval in platinum-sensitive patients 
with a BRCA mutation (germline or somatic) who have received ≥2 prior chemotherapy regimens. 
6.3.  Discussion 
Submission of results from study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) was imposed as a specific obligation (SOB) 
during the initial CMA assessment because, as a randomized trial in a similar setting, it was likely to 
provide comprehensive clinical data to further confirm the safety and efficacy of rucaparib in the 
treatment of platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germ line and/ or somatic), 
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (as included in Annex II). As 
explained in the EPAR, clinical evidence at the time of granting the CMA was limited, but an unmet 
medical need was established in patients who could not further tolerate platinum treatment, also taking 
into account that an oral treatment could improve patient’s convenience. 
The initial conditional authorisation was based on pooled population subgroup (n=106) data from two 
Phase 2 open label studies (Study CO 338 010 [Study 10] and Study CO 338 017 [ARIEL2]), which 
included adult patients with ovarian cancer who received 2 or more previous lines of chemotherapy and 
whose tumours had a deleterious mutation (germline or somatic) in BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
Study CO-338-043 is an ongoing phase 3, open-label, multicenter, randomized study of rucaparib versus 
chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, BRCA-mutant, high-grade epithelial serous or Grade 2 or 3 
endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.   
Design and conduct of the trial 
This is an open-label study, as the investigational treatment (rucaparib) and the comparator 
(chemotherapy) differ in their route of administration, thus lack of blinding of the study is acknowledged. 
The study is comprised by three phases: screening and randomization, treatment and post-
treatment/crossover phase, where patients initially randomized to chemotherapy had the option to cross 
over to rucaparib treatment following progression. 
Overall, inclusion and exclusion criteria appear acceptable. Patients should have received two or more 
prior chemotherapy regimens, including a platinum in at least one of them; and have relapsed or 
progressive disease confirmed by radiologic assessment. Patients should have a deleterious BRCA 1/2 
mutation as confirmed by the central lab, although subjects could be enrolled based on local lab 
assessment provided there was tumour tissue available for the central confirmation. Patients who had 
received any previous PARP inhibitor and/or single-agent paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel were excluded. As 
opposed to the initial application pooled efficacy population, platinum resistant patients (disease 
progression had occurred between 4 weeks and 6 months after previous platinum treatment) could be 
recruited and not only platinum sensitive patients (i.e. fully platinum sensitive and partially platinum 
sensitive patients). 
Randomization (2:1) was stratified based on the time to progression following the last dose of platinum 
containing therapy: platinum-resistant (PFI ≥1 to <6 months); partially platinum sensitive (PFI ≥6 to 
<12 months); and platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥12 months). At the time of the CMA, the MAH was 
recommended (REC 8) to amend the protocol to ensure that, at least, 270 partially platinum-sensitive 
patients were enrolled in this study to confirm the positive benefit-risk of rucaparib in this population. 
During annual renewal procedure EMEA/H/C/004272/R/0016, the MAH alleged that, due to the increasing 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 65/234 
 
 
 
 
 
availability of PARP inhibitors, recruitment had slowed down and that amendment to the protocol would 
prevent them from fulfilling SOB001 on the due date. This was accepted by the CHMP albeit it was made 
clear that the study was not powered to detect the treatment effect individually for each subgroup. 
Patients in the rucaparib arm received the 600 mg BID currently approved dosage in 28-days cycles. In 
the control arm, patients could receive weekly paclitaxel (platinum-resistant and partially platinum-
sensitive) or, by investigator choice, platinum monotherapy or doublet (platinum-sensitive), up to 8 
cycles. The comparator seems appropriate although other options for platinum-resistant subjects could 
have been explored such as PLD, gemcitabine or topotecan, but none of them have shown superiority. 
Platinum-based doublets could have been a treatment option for partially platinum sensitive patients but, 
as the approved indication for rucaparib is restricted to patients who are not further candidates to receive 
platinum treatment, weekly paclitaxel seems to be an adequate comparator for this subgroup in Study 
CO-338-043. This said, the fact that patients with fully platinum sensitive disease were randomized to 
received platinum therapy renders the subgroup of study patients with platinum-sensitive disease 
included in ARIEL4 not identical to the approved indication with platinum-sensitive patients who are 
unable to tolerate further platinum-based therapy; see further comments below.  
The study design was subject to different changes. A first amendment to the original protocol was issued 
on 11-Jan-2018, with around 100 subjects enrolled, where PFS by RECIST v1.1 as assessed by 
Independent Radiology Review (irrPFS) was included as the key secondary endpoint, first to be tested, 
followed by OS and, then, the rest of secondary endpoints. By Amendment 2, dated 23-Oct-2020, irrPFS 
and OS were removed from the hierarchical step down testing procedure and were defined as stand-alone 
secondary endpoints. This protocol update was performed after the data cut-off (i.e. 30-Sep-2020), with 
enrolment complete, which called into question the integrity of the study, particularly in the context of an 
open-label trial, since it could not be ruled out that the changes were data-driven. Upon request, the MAH 
provided an outline of the events/changes that occurred after the needed number of events for the main 
endpoint analysis was reached. In this description it was highlighted that the Sponsor was only unblinded 
in December 2020 so that they did not have access to individual results and treatment allocation data at 
the time when Amendment 2 was being prepared. The only SAP version for this study (dated 28-Oct-
2020) was also finalized after the database lock, at the same time that Amendment 2. Amendment 2 re-
defined the primary analysis population and established the Efficacy Population (excluding patients with a 
BRCA reversion mutation) as the primary efficacy analysis population and the ITT Population as the one 
to be tested, for each endpoint, if the first one was statistically significant; as part of an step-down 
testing procedure. The included changes were supported by available literature that identified reversion 
mutations as an important mechanism of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors and even to platinum 
agents (as DNA-damaging chemotherapy) as these mutations seemed to partly restore wild-type gene 
function. In any case, no relevant efficacy differences have been identified between the ‘efficacy’ and ‘ITT’ 
population, probably due to the fact that they only differ in 23 subjects and in fact the original protocol 
already stated that these patients would be excluded from the main efficacy analyses. 
The fact that no (secondary) analysis of PFS by blinded independent committee review (BICR; IRR as 
referred by the MAH) was submitted constitute a limitation, see below. For pathologies like ovarian cancer 
with frequent non-target lesions and diffuse intraperitoneal spread patterns, centralized independent 
confirmation of PFS is of particular relevance, moreover in the context of an open label study. At the very 
least irrPFS results from an ‘audit’ sample to assess/confirm concordance would have been expected. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is PFS by RECIST v.1.1 as assessed by the investigator. The secondary 
endpoints ORR, DOR, ORR and/or CA-125 response and PRO were part of a hierarchical step-down testing 
procedure, in order to preserve the overall Type 1 error rate. PFS as assessed by a BICR and OS are 
defined as stand-alone secondary efficacy endpoints in the current version of the protocol. According to 
the SAP (latest version), PFS by BICR was not required to be performed at the time of the initial CSR, 
therefore it was not tested and its results are not available.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Up to the visit cut-off date (30-Sep-2020), 349 patients were randomized (ITT Population) to receive 
rucaparib (N=233) or chemotherapy (N=116). For the Efficacy Population, 220 and 105 subjects 
remained in the rucaparib and chemotherapy treatment arms, respectively. At the DCO, 188 (80.7%) 
subjects from rucaparib arm and 108 (93.1%) subjects from chemotherapy arm had discontinued 
treatment, most of them (70.7% vs. 54.4%) due to disease progression by RECIST v.1.1. Also, 7.4% 
patients in the rucaparib arm and 2.8% in the chemotherapy arm discontinued treatment due to clinical 
progression. The fact that around 30% more patients discontinued due to radiological disease progression 
in the rucaparib arm as compared to the chemotherapy arm could be due to certain number of subjects in 
the chemotherapy arm who may have progressed after receiving the maximum number of treatment 
cycles, while rucaparib is given until progression.  
Regarding baseline characteristics, in general, they seemed to be well balanced between both treatment 
arms except for ECOG performance status and age groups, i.e. slightly younger patients were included in 
the rucaparib arm and patients in chemotherapy arm had a relatively better ECOG PS. These differences 
are however not expected to have a relevant impact on the reported results. Most patients had 
measurable disease at baseline per the investigator (96.1% rucaparib, 91.4% chemotherapy), for whom 
ORR and DOR have been tested. Nearly all patients had epithelial ovarian cancer (94.4% rucaparib; 
95.7% chemotherapy), with the remainder approximately evenly split between fallopian tube and primary 
peritoneal cancer, and most patients had serous histology (89.3% rucaparib; 90.5% chemotherapy). 
As already said, randomization was stratified by PFI; however, there were no restrictions on how many 
patients could be enrolled in each PFI stratum. For the ITT Population, 20.6% of rucaparib patients and 
22.4% of chemotherapy patients were in the platinum-sensitive stratum; 27.9% of rucaparib patients and 
26.7% of chemotherapy patients were in the partially platinum-sensitive stratum, and 51.5% of rucaparib 
patients and 50.9% of chemotherapy patients were included in the platinum-resistant randomization 
stratum. Regarding BRCA mutation status, 74.5% of patients in the ITT Population presented BRCA1 gene 
mutation while BRCA2 mutation was identified in 25.2% of patients. Eighty four percent of patients in the 
ITT Population had germline BRCA mutation. 
The study met its primary endpoint. A statistically significant improvement in invPFS was reported with 
rucaparib treatment compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.639 [95% CI, 0.489-0.835]; p=0.0010) in the 
Efficacy Population. The estimated median invPFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 7.3-9.1) for the rucaparib 
group compared to 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-7.3) for the chemotherapy group. Comparable results were 
seen in the ITT Population, with a point estimate HR of 0.665 (95% CI, 0.516-0.858), p=0.0017. 
Prespecified sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint were performed to evaluate the impact of 
censored patients and results confirmed what had been observed for the primary analysis. 
Regarding secondary endpoints, a higher confirmed ORR, as assessed by the investigator, was 
observed in the rucaparib group (40.3%, 95% CI 33.6%-47.2%) as compared to the chemotherapy 
group (32.3%, 95% CI 23.1%-42.6%), however this difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0.1287) so, per the ordered step-down procedure, statistical significance cannot be claimed for the 
subsequent endpoints and they are considered descriptive. For ORR in the ITT Population, similar results 
were observed, with an ORR in the rucaparib treatment group of 37.9% (95% CI, 31.6%-44.7%) 
compared to 30.2% (95% CI, 21.7%-39.9%) in the chemotherapy group. Focusing on DOR, similar 
results were seen for both populations, with a longer duration of response reported in the rucaparib group 
compared to the chemotherapy group: 9.4 vs. 7.2 months for the rucaparib and chemotherapy arms, 
respectively, in the Efficacy Population. The proportion of patients with a confirmed RECIST v1.1 response 
and/or CA-125 response were also higher for the rucaparib arm (50.7% vs. 43.6%) in the Efficacy 
Population.

Out of the hierarchical step-down testing procedure, PFS by BICR was not tested (see comments 
above). Since scans were collected for review, the MAH was requested to provide the results of the 
analysis of PFS by BICR for both the Efficacy and ITT Populations, bearing in mind the open-label nature 
of the study and the particular nature of the disease. It is acknowledged that some discrepancies between 
investigator and BICR-assessed PFS have been reported in the literature in trials where PARP inhibitors 
are used, but, as stated above, at the very least an audit sample to confirm the concordance between 
both PFS assessments would have been expected. Results from this analysis were expected to be 
provided at the time of the final OS analysis, which was projected to occur later this year. However, in 
view that the MAH had requested to remove the ‘treatment’ indication (see additional information below), 
no further efficacy data from the ARIEL4 study was formally requested. 
At the time of the data cut-off, an IA of OS was performed, when 51% of the planned events had 
occurred. The final OS analysis was planned, per the SAP, when 70% maturity would have been reached, 
i.e. 245 events of death are needed within the 349 randomized patients.  
Regarding OS results, at the time of the IA, in the Efficacy Population, the median OS was 19.6 months 
(95% CI, 16.8-24.0) in the rucaparib group compared to 27.1 months (95% CI, 22.2-38.1) in the 
chemotherapy group, with a HR of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.085-2.214), p=0.0161. Similar results were observed 
for the ITT Population (median OS was 18.8 months for the rucaparib group vs. 25.9 months for the 
chemotherapy group; HR 1.484 [95% CI, 1.069-2.061]). While statistical significance was not reached, a 
clear benefit seems to be observed with chemotherapy over rucaparib. The MAH argues that at the time 
of the IA OS data were still immature, but this analysis was performed with a 51% of data maturity when 
the final OS analysis was planned with 70% of events, so data do not seem so immature. It appears thus 
unlikely that these results may change with longer follow up. The MAH initially provided a post-hoc OS 
analysis excluding patients who crossed over to rucaparib (not included in this report). However, the 
reported OS results are not likely to be explained only by cross-over since cross-over would rather be 
expected to lead to a convergence of the OS results in the two groups. Further, the presented analyses of 
patients not crossing over likely represents a removal of the subset of patients in the control arm that are 
most fit and have the best prognosis which hampers interpretation. It was considered during the first 
round of this procedure that conducting additional analyses using alternative methods could be helpful to 
adjust for this crossover even if they are not devoid of limitations as they rely on underlying (strong) 
assumptions and would only be considered as supportive. Reference was made to the following EMA 
guidance: “Question and answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology trials 
(EMA/845963/2018)”. No analyses according to this guideline were however submitted by the MAH. 
Instead, the MAH considered that as a result of the cross-over, three distinct non-crossing survival curves 
can be observed and that employing a time-adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards model is appropriate to 
further explore the confounding OS results. This method has been applied for the ITT, the Efficacy 
Population and the platinum status subgroups. There are 2 factors which assess the treatment effect in 
this model: the Z fixed factor for the randomisation to the control arm and the time-dependent X factor 
for the exposure to rucaparib at any time. This approach has several methodological concerns and would 
need to be supplemented with a series of analysis with and without the fixed Z factor and the use of 
covariates, in particular including those measuring the patient status and the severity of the disease at 
crossover. This will give a range of scenarios, which could be helpful for the understanding of the 
crossover on the OS. Bearing in mind all the above, the MAH was referred again to the above mentioned 
EMA guidance and was asked to provide further analyses. Additional analyses were submitted. However, 
even though some of the sensitivity analyses displayed non-negative OS results with regards to the effect 
of rucaparib over the chemotherapy arm, there were several concerns in terms of the methods used 
(relying on strong assumptions) that do not allow to conclude that a detrimental effect on OS can be 
ruled-out. In addition, as the number of patients in the control arm is small, it was considered that 
baseline covariates might have impacted the results and the MAH was asked to perform a multi-variate 
analysis modelling the impact of different baseline/prognostic factors on OS. Results from the full model 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 68/234 
 
 
 
 
are however not interpretable due to its complexity and the inclusion of too many variables so it only can 
be seen as an hypothesis generating analysis. To better clarify the weight of possible imbalances in the 
baseline demographics and disease characteristics in these unexpected OS results, the MAH was 
requested to provide tabular summaries of these baseline demographics and disease characteristics at the 
time of randomization for three different subgroups of patients: patients randomized to rucaparib, 
patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to rucaparib after progression, and patients from 
the chemotherapy arm who did not cross over. These data were provided and no relevant differences 
were identified between groups that could justify the observed findings in OS. In addition, further 
information on patients who crossed-over to the rucaparib arm was also requested. According to the 
MAH, the reasons why eligible patients did not cross over to rucaparib were not collected. However, since 
there were only 13 (14%) patients who did not cross-over, the influence of bias due to these patients not 
switching at progression is expected to be limited. 
PFS2 results have also been provided as an exploratory endpoint. Up to the data cut-off date (30 Sept 
2020), a total of 200 (57.3%) patients received subsequent anti-cancer treatment, 115 (49.4%) in the 
rucaparib arm and 85 (73.3%) in the placebo arm. No statistically significant differences were observed in 
either the Efficacy population (HR 0.903 [95% CI, 0.676-1.207]) and the ITT Population (HR 0.925 [95% 
CI, 0.703-1.216]). PFS2 data by stratification subgroups were also provided. 
As already outlined, subgroup analyses by stratification strata are especially relevant in the context of 
the purpose of this procedure: confirming rucaparib efficacy for 3L treatment of platinum-sensitive 
patients who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. During the CMA assessment, 
efficacy of rucaparib was established in a pooled population of 106 BRCA mutated patients who had 
receive ≥2 previous treatment lines where almost 74% of subjects had a PFI ≥6 months (considered as 
platinum-sensitive). For this reason, in Study CO-338-043, the main efficacy endpoints analyses in the 
platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥12 months, n=74, 48 vs. 26) and partially platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥6 to <12 
months, n=96, 65 vs. 31) strata have been further discussed along this report. In both subgroups, an 
improvement in invPFS, was observed with rucaparib over chemotherapy, i.e. HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.37, 
1.29) and HR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.66), respectively. An estimated HR for both subgroups combined 
is also reported, i.e.  HR of 0.502 (95% CI:  0.343, 0.733). Also, additional post-hoc analyses were 
performed for ORR by platinum sensitivity status confirming the beneficial effect of rucaparib in both the 
Efficacy and ITT Population with measurable disease. 
Additional analyses of the OS interim results by platinum sensitivity subgroup were provided for both the 
ITT and the Efficacy Population. The reported HRs for the Efficacy Population were 1.124 (95% CI: 0.438, 
2.884) for the platinum-sensitive (PFI > 12 months) group, 1.258 (95% CI: 0.645, 2.454) for the 
partially platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 to 12 months) group, and 1.789 (95% CI: 1.120, 2.858) for the 
platinum-resistant (PFI >1 to <6 months) group.  
During the procedure, updated OS and PFS2 data were provided. Results from the final OS analysis (DCO 
10 April 2022) in the ITT population of study ARIEL4, were consistent with the IA and athough not 
statistically significant, clearly favoured the chemotherapy treatment over rucaparib (HR=1.31; 95% CI: 
1.00, 1.73; p=0.0507). It is acknowledged that the detrimental effect on OS observed in the ARIEL4 
study is driven (mostly) by the platinum resistant subgroup where the worst results are observed 
(HR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.17) and which, represented 51% of the patient population. It is also agreed 
that in the context of the approved ‘treatment’ indication (i.e. platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, 
BRCA mutated patients who are unable to tolerate further platinum-based chemotherapy), the subgroup 
of platinum sensitive patients (particularly those partially sensitive), represent the most relevant 
population to confirm efficacy of rucaparib. However, and albeit the limitations to extract definitive 
conclusions from subgroups’ data, in the platinum sensitive populations, either pooled or separate, OS 
results are also not reassuring (HR for the fully + partially, fully, and partially platinum sensitive 
subgroups are, respectively, 1.07 [95% CI: 0.71, 1.62], 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62, 2.50] and 0.97 [95% CI: 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 69/234 
 
 
 
 
0.58, 1.62]. Of note, a worse effect in the fully-sensitive subgroup is not to be compensated by a better 
effect in the partially-sensitive, also due to difficulties in pooling to subgroups with in principle different 
prognosis.  In addition, as mentioned above, the subgroup of study patients with platinum-sensitive 
disease included in ARIEL4 is not identical to the approved indication with platinum-sensitive patients who 
are unable to tolerate further platinum-based therapy. This is also supported by the information on 
subsequent therapies provided by the MAH. For those patients who were randomised to the rucaparib 
arm and who progressed, nearly all received a subsequent chemotherapy regimen, with the majority 
receiving platinum-based treatment and a smaller percentage receiving non-platinum chemotherapy 
treatment. Platinum-based regimens were the most frequent first subsequent therapies in patients who 
were partially platinum-sensitive or platinum-sensitive at baseline initially randomised to rucaparib. 
Interestingly, despite these patients being platinum-resistant, 38.2% patients received platinum-based 
chemotherapy as monotherapy or in combination therap. This constitutes an additional uncertainty that 
relates to the representativeness of the ARIEL4 study for the treatment indication population. 
In summary, the PFS results observed in study CO-338-043 can be considered as overall consistent with 
those reported in the pooled efficacy population from Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017A, which were 
the basis of the initial conditional approval. However, important uncertainties still remain regarding a 
potential detrimental effect on OS when rucaparib is used over chemotherapy in the specific patient 
population covered by the indication. To address these outstanding uncertainties further information / 
discussion would be needed, which was requested during the Article 20 referral procedure. However the 
MAH did not provide responses to the adopted list of issues for the referral, following their (voluntary) 
request to remove the “treatment” indication from the product information. Therefore, no further 
questions to the MAH were posed in the context of this procedure.   
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
In fulfillment of SOB001, the CSR for Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) has been completed and submitted. 
Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, randomized study evaluating rucaparib 
versus chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed, high-grade epithelial serous or Grade 2 
or 3 endometrioid ovarian, FTC, or PPC.  
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
In Study CO-338-043, a total of 349 patients were randomized 2:1 to rucaparib or chemotherapy (ie, 
Intent-to-treat [ITT] population). The Safety Population included 345 patients who received at least 1 
dose of study treatment (600 mg twice a day [BID] rucaparib [232 patients] or chemotherapy [113 
patients]), as there were 4 patients who were randomized but never dosed.  
Safety data from Study CO-338-043 are presented in the SCS as stand-alone data, and safety data from 
Study CO-338-043 have also been integrated with the most recent data-cuts from Studies CO-338-010, 
CO-338-017, and CO-338-014 (referred to as the “Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population”; 
N=1,169).

The median duration of rucaparib exposure was 7.4 months for the ovarian cancer patients with BRCA 
mutations from the pooled Safety Population for Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 (N = 143) in the 
initial Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). Within the maintenance setting in Study CO-338-014, 
the median duration of rucaparib exposure was 11.6 months for the tBRCA (includes germline BRCA 
[gBRCA] and somatic BRCA [sBRCA] mutations) Safety Population (N = 129).

Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs 
The majority of patients in either treatment group experienced Grade 2 or Grade 3 TEAEs, and Grade 2 or 
Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs. In the rucaparib group, a higher incidence of Grade 3 TEAEs (all 
causality and treatment-related) was reported as compared to the chemotherapy group.

In Study CO-338-043, commonly experienced Grade 3 or higher treatment-related TEAEs in the 
rucaparib group included combined anemia/hemoglobin decreased and combined neutropenia/decreased 
ANC. In the chemotherapy group, commonly experienced Grade 3 or higher treatment-related TEAEs

included combined neutropenia/decreased ANC. The observations were consistent with all causality Grade 
3 or higher TEAEs in both groups. 
The incidences of treatment-related Grade 3 or higher TEAEs in patients treated with rucaparib in the 
Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population were similar to those presented for all causality. Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs were typically considered by the investigator to be related to rucaparib, with combined 
anemia/hemoglobin decreased and combined ALT/AST increased being most common.

Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Deaths 
In Study CO-338-043, 15 patients (6.5%) in the rucaparib group and 3 patients (2.7%) in the 
chemotherapy group had at least 1 TEAE with a fatal outcome. Many of the TEAEs reported with an 
outcome of death were malignant neoplasm progression (5 patients in the rucaparib group and 2 patients 
in the chemotherapy group). Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, such events were no longer 
collected. There were no treatment-related TEAEs with an outcome of death in the chemotherapy group. 
Three patients in the rucaparib group experienced treatment-related TEAEs with an outcome of death 
(MDS, Cardiac disorder, and Death Not Otherwise Specified).

Deaths – Crossover Part 
Two patients (2.7%) had at least 1 TEAE with a fatal outcome, including 1 patient with malignant 
neoplasm progression and 1 patient with acute respiratory failure, neither of which were considered 
treatment-related. 
Serious adverse events 
Serious TEAEs occurred in 26.7% of patients in the rucaparib group and 11.5% of patients in the 
chemotherapy group in the Treatment Part of Study CO-338-043. The most frequently reported SAEs 
were combined anemia/hemoglobin decreased in both the rucaparib and chemotherapy groups. These 
SAEs were also the most frequently experienced treatment-related SAEs, with every incidence considered 
related to the study treatment administered. The numbers of treatment-emergent SAEs adjusted to 100 
patient-years exposure were similar between rucaparib (35.6 events) and chemotherapy (31.2 events).

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) and pneumonitis have been identified 
as AESIs.

Myelodysplastic syndrome and AML are considered AESIs and are listed as a potential risk in the EU-RMP. 
Data are presented for AESIs reported in the Clovis-sponsored clinical development program, including 15 
Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies of rucaparib alone or in combination with other cancer treatments in 
multiple solid tumor types as of 19 December 2020. 
In approximately 2,972 patients treated with rucaparib (includes patients who received rucaparib in 
ongoing and completed studies, but excluding investigator-initiated trials), there were 27 patients 
(0.91%) who developed MDS or AML (including MDS transforming into AML), including during the long-
term follow-up. These included: 
-  Study CO-338-043 (n = 5; 2.2% [N = 232]): 4 patients with MDS and 1 patient with AML; 
-  Study CO-338-010 (n = 2; 2.7% [N = 74]): 2 patients with MDS; 
-  Study CO-338-017 (n = 6; 1.2% [N = 491]): 4 patients with MDS and 2 patients with AML; 
-  Study CO-338-014 (n = 14; 3.8% [N = 372]): 6 patients with MDS, including refractory anemia 
with excess blasts; 5 patients with AML, and 3 patients with MDS transforming into AML. 
For these 27 patients, the duration of rucaparib treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from 
< 2 months to > 4 years. Thirteen patients (2 patients from Study CO-338-010, 2 patients from Study 
CO-338-017, 6 patients from Study CO-338-014, and 3 patients from Study CO-338-043) had an event 
that occurred during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow-up. 
• 
Pneumonitis 
Pneumonitis and associated events, including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, acute 
interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis necrotizing, alveolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and organizing 
pneumonia, were collected as TEAEs through the 30 September 2020 visit cutoff of this report, being 
added as AESIs in Amendment 2 of the protocol, dated 23 October 2020. None of these events were 
collected in the scope of AESI collection. However, 1 patient in the chemotherapy group reported a TEAE 
of pneumonitis 54 days after starting study drug. The TEAE was not related to chemotherapy and was not 
serious. The patient recovered from this TEAE and continued the study. There were no other AEs of 
pneumonitis or associated events reported in the study. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Based on laboratory data, myelosuppression (anemia, decreased white blood cell count, decreased 
lymphocytes and decreased neutrophils) was observed during treatment with rucaparib or chemotherapy 
in the Treatment Part of Study CO-338-043. 
Most of the worst grade on-treatment and shifts from baseline for hematology parameters during the 
Treatment Part were Grade 1 or 2, with low incidences observed for Grade 3 or 4. Patients who received 
rucaparib more frequently experienced shifts to Grade 3 and Grade 4 anemia and platelet count 
decreased as compared with chemotherapy, and patients who received chemotherapy more frequently 
experienced shifts to Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased and lymphocyte count decreased. 
Laboratory observations were consistent with the TEAE reporting of Grade 3 and Grade 4 events of 
myelosuppression.

In Study CO-338-043, the most common clinical chemistry abnormalities for patients in the rucaparib 
group were increases in cholesterol, increases in ALT/AST, hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and 
hypertriglyceridemia.  
Most of the worst grade on-treatment and shifts from baseline for clinical chemistry parameters were 
Grade 1 or 2, with low incidences observed for Grade 3 or 4. The highest incidences of worst grade on-
treatment were for ALT increased in the rucaparib group and for hyperglycemia in the chemotherapy 
group. In the rucaparib group, the incidences of shifts to Grade 3 or Grade 4 were highest with ALT 
increased, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and creatinine increased; in the chemotherapy group, these 
shifts were highest with hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia.

Adverse drug reactions 
Safety data reviewed for identification of ADRs presented in Section 4.8 of the current SmPC included 
safety data from Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017, and the placebo-controlled Study CO-338-014. 
These data represented 937 patients with ovarian cancer who received rucaparib as monotherapy in 
these studies in the treatment and maintenance treatment settings. 
The updated safety data in patients treated with rucaparib from Study CO-338-043 (N = 232), and from 
the Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population (N = 1,169), are consistent with the previously submitted 
ovarian cancer data. Hence only modest changes to some of the ADR frequency categories are proposed 
in Section 4.8 of the SmPC, while no ADRs are proposed by the MAH for addition or removal from the 
tabulated list of adverse reactions in the SmPC. 
The proposed changes to the frequency categories of some ADRs in the tabulated list of adverse reactions 
in the SmPC are summarized in the table below.  
Table 49: Proposed Changes to the Frequency Categories of Adverse Drug Reactions in the SmPC 
Post marketing experience 
Rucaparib (Rubraca) is currently marketed in the US, United Kingdom (UK), Israel, and in selected 
countries in the EU (Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands). As detailed in the current Periodic 
Safety Update Report (PSUR) dated 16 February 2021, patient exposure from marketing experience is 
presented by the number of individual patients exposed to Rubraca since the Marketing Authorization was 
granted in the US on 19 December 2016, whereas commercial exposure to Rubraca in the EU and UK has 
been calculated as treatment days. Cumulatively, to 19 December 2020, 7,509 patients have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 101/234 
 
 
 
 
 
exposed worldwide to Rubraca (excluding commercial exposure in the EU and UK). Cumulatively, the total 
commercial exposure to Rubraca in the EU (Germany, Italy, Spain, France) and the UK was 139,365 
treatment days. 
According to the MAH, from US approval on 19 December 2016 to 19 December 2020, there were no 
safety signals detected from the post-marketing reports. The post-marketing safety data collected from 
19 December 2016 to 19 December 2020 are consistent with the known safety profile of rucaparib. Post-
marketing safety surveillance is ongoing. Overall, the post-marketing safety data remain consistent with 
the known safety profile of rucaparib in clinical trials. 
7.3.  Discussion 
Through the current variation application, the MAH is providing results of study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) 
to fulfil the SOB 001. 
The safety dataset is comprised by 345 patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (232 
rucaparib and 113 chemotherapy). In addition, pooled safety data from studies CO-338-010 (a phase 1/2 
open label study; n=74), study CO-338-017 (a phase 2, open-label study; n=491) and study CO-338-014 
(a phase 3, randomised study of rucaparib versus placebo; n= 561) with study ARIEL4 have been 
provided (referred to as the “pooled ovarian safety population”), based on a total of 1,169 patients 
treated with rucaparib.  
Safety data of studies CO-338-014, CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 were submitted during the initial CMA 
application with the 15 April 2017 visit cut-off date. During a subsequent procedure updated safety data 
were provided (data cut-off of 31 Dec 2017). The current safety data of these 3 studies are based, on a 
data cut-off of 31 Dec 2019, 1 Feb 2019 and 27 March 2019, respectively. Results of study ARIEL4 
presented below are based on a data cut-off of 30 Sep 2020.  
In the ARIEL4 study, the median duration of rucaparib exposure was of 7.3 months (range: 0, 41), 
compared with the 3.6 months (range: 0, 25) of chemotherapy. Moreover, in the rucaparib arm 27.2% of 
patients received treatment for ≥12 months compared with 3.5% in the chemotherapy arm. Due to 
differences in treatment exposure, which may have impacted the results, safety data adjusted by 
treatment exposure (i.e., incidence per 100 patient-years of treatment), have also been provided. 
The majority of patients in the chemotherapy arm received paclitaxel (78%) followed by platinum-based 
doublet (14%) and platinum monotherapy (8%). The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was of 5 
(range: 1, 21). As per protocol, patients in the chemotherapy arm, can receive up to 8 cycles However, 
the restriction to a maximum of 8 cycles applied only to platinum-containing regimens. Patients receiving 
weekly paclitaxel could continue treatment until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation. 
Patients treated with rucaparib had a median age of 59 (range: 38, 85) years, with only 7 (3%) patients 
being 75 years or older. The majority of patients were white (94%) and had a good performance status 
(ECOG 0 or 1). Patients with ECOG≥2 were excluded from the study. The proportion of patients with 
ECOG 1 was higher in the rucaparib arm (46% vs. 39%). Patients had received a median of 2 prior 
therapies (range: 2, 9). 
The most commonly reported (≥30%) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the rucaparib 
arm were: combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased (53.9% rucaparib vs. 31.9% chemotherapy), 
nausea (53.4% vs. 31.9%), combined asthenia/fatigue/lethargy (49.6% vs. 45.1%), combined ALT/AST 
increased (34.5% vs. 11.5%), vomiting (34.1% vs. 16.8%) and combined abdominal pain (31.9% vs. 
22.1%). After adjusting for treatment exposure, the only TEAE with a higher incidence in the rucaparib 
arm was combined ALT/AST increased (45.9 TEAEs per 100 patient-years of treatment).  
There were a total of 12 (5.2%) patients in the rucaparib arm while only 1 (0.9%) in the chemotherapy 
arm that reported an event of intestinal obstruction. Of the events reported in the rucaparib arm, 5 
Assessment report

patients reported a SAE of intestinal obstruction (see below). The MAH was requested to provide further 
information on all the events of intestinal obstruction reported in the ARIEL4 study (as well as the pooled 
population) and discuss to what extent there was any relationship with rucaparib treatment. According to 
the MAH the events of intestinal obstruction reported in patients treated with rucaparib appear to be 
primarily related to the underlying disease rather than rucaparib treatment. The majority of events were 
not considered related to rucaparib by the investigator. In addition, the MAH stated that no differences 
were observed between treatment arms in the ARIEL3 study (3.2% rucaparib vs. 3.2% placebo), 
suggesting that these events were not related to study treatment. Regarding study ARIEL4, the MAH 
argues that differences observed between treatment arms may be due to the longer treatment exposure 
in the rucaparib arm. Thus, the MAH was requested to provide exposure-adjusted incidences of these 
events and the narratives of all patients that reported an event of intestinal obstruction. The submitted 
results still showed higher incidence in the rucaparib arm although the imbalances seemed to be smaller 
(8.0 events per 100 patient-years of treatment for rucaparib vs. 4.8 events per 100 patient-years for 
chemotherapy). For related AEs, the numbers were 0.6 events per 100 patient-years of treatment for 
rucaparib vs. 0 events per 100 patient-years for chemotherapy. After the review of the narratives, it is 
difficult to exclude a potential relationship with rucaparib. In this context, even if it is agreed that the 
underlying disease may have played a role, based on the exposure-adjusted rates and previous 
observations of intestinal obstruction, including serious events (Rubraca EPARs EMA/CHMP/238139/2018, 
EMA/902679/2019), the MAH included information on this AE in the SmPC (sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
TEAEs of Grade ≥3 were reported in 58.6% of patients in the rucaparib arm and 38.1% in the 
chemotherapy arm. After adjusting for treatment exposure, the incidence per 100 patient-years of TEAEs 
of Grade≥3 was lower in the rucaparib arm (78 vs. 103.3). The most commonly reported (≥10%) TEAEs 
of Grade≥3 were combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased (22.4% rucaparib vs. 5.3% chemotherapy) 
and combined neutropenia/decreased ANC (10.3% vs. 15.1%).  
Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) occurred in 26.7% of patients treated with 
rucaparib and 11.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy. TESAEs adjusted to 100 patient-years 
exposure were similar between treatment arms (35.6% rucaparib vs. 31.2% chemotherapy). TESAEs 
most frequently reported were combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased (19 [8.2%] rucaparib vs. 2 
[1.8%]), combined thrombocytopenia/decreased platelets (7 [3.0%] vs. 1 [0.9%]), intestinal obstruction 
(6 [2.6%], including one case of small intestinal obstruction) and malignant neoplasm progression (5 
[2.2%] vs. 1 [0.9%]). In addition, 4 cases were reported among patients who crossed-over to rucaparib 
treatment. Some of these events appears to be related to the underlying disease, but in some others, 
contribution of rucaparib cannot be ruled out. See further discussion above. 
Regarding TEAEs with a fatal outcome, there were 15 patients (6.5%) in the rucaparib arm and 3 
(2.7%) in the chemotherapy arm. Five of these events in the rucaparib arm and 2 in the chemotherapy 
arm were due to malignant neoplasm progression. According to the MAH, with amendment 2 of the 
protocol, disease progression was no longer collected as TEAE. In the rucaparib arm, there were 3 deaths 
that were considered treatment-related (MDS, cardiac failure and death not otherwise specified).  
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) are considered adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs) of rucaparib. Among a total of 2,972 patients treated with rucaparib in clinical 
trials, 27 patients (0.91%) had reported an event of MDS or AML. In study ARIEL4, five patients reported 
an event of MDS/AML (4 MDS and 1 AML) in the rucaparib arm, one of them fatal. Most of these events 
(all except one) were considered treatment-related by the investigator. MDS/AML is currently included in 
section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and it is considered an important potential risk of rucaparib. These 
events have also been reported with other PARP inhibitors such as olaparib and niraparib. During the 
procedure, updated safety data regarding MDS/AML were provided. Based on a later DCO (10 April 2022), 
2 additional cases of MDS were reported in patients randomized to rucaparib. As a result of the new data 
provided the SmPC was updated to reflect these new cases of MDS/AML.  
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022

Pneumonitis was included as AESI with Amendment 2 of the protocol. According to the MAH, only one 
event of pneumonitis was reported in the chemotherapy arm. No further events were reported in the 
study in either treatment arm. 
Changes from baseline in laboratory results were consistent with the reported TEAEs, being the most 
common anaemia and abnormal liver function tests. Further, hypophosphatemia and hyperglycaemia 
were also frequently reported. Most of the reported elevations were of Grade 1 or Grade 2.  
The number of patients with QTc values ≥481 msec or ≥501 msec, and change from baseline of >60 
msec were comparable between treatment arms. However, there was a higher number of patients with a 
QTc value ≥450 msec and change from baseline of >30 msec in the rucaparib arm. Nevertheless, an 
increase in TEAEs was not observed.  
Safety data by age, race, BRCA mutated gene and BRCA mutation status (germline and somatic) have 
been provided. Overall, some differences in the reported AE rates were found but the subgroups sample 
size and the lack of stratification prevent any definitive conclusion about them. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (classified per the EMA guideline) rucaparib treatment 
resulted in an increased incidence of TESAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death, TEAEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation and dose reduction/interruption compared to patients with normal renal 
function. In patients with mild renal impairment a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs and TEAEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation was also observed. However, these results are in line with prior data 
submitted. As recommended in the SmPC, no starting dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. Further recommendations are currently included regarding use of rucaparib 
in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Safety data by platinum status showed a higher rate of TESAEs, TEAEs of Grade≥3, TEAEs leading to 
death, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation and TEAEs leading to dose reduction/interruption in 
the partially platinum-sensitive group (n=65). Among the most commonly reported TEAEs in patients 
treated with rucaparib, combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased and combined neutropenia/decreased 
ANC had a higher incidence in this subgroup of patients. Other common TEAEs were more frequently 
reported in the subgroup of platinum-sensitive compared with the overall population (combined AST/ALT 
increased, gastrointestinal disorders, dysgeusia and alopecia). Overall, when comparing the platinum-
sensitive and partially platinum-sensitive population (the population most similar to the one covered by 
the CMA) versus the platinum resistant subjects, no clinically relevant imbalances were identified for 
deaths, SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation or dose modifications.  
Discontinuation due to TEAEs was low in the rucaparib arm (20 [8.6%] rucaparib vs. 15 [13.3%] 
chemotherapy).  
In conclusion, the safety profile of rucaparib in study ARIEL4 appears to be in line with its already 
known safety profile based on previous clinical trials. Moreover, most TEAEs were less frequently reported 
than in the pooled population, except for combined anaemia/haemoglobin decreased (53.9% vs. 44.7%).  
The MAH has proposed to add a new post-authorisation measure (recommendation) to its Letter of 
Recommendation to submit and addendum to the CSR of ARIEL4 study. Even if the the ‘treatment’ 
indication is removed from the PI (EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033), updated safety from the ARIEL4 
study should be provided with the final CSR in order to update the PI. The MAH proposed that section 4.8 
of the SmPC will include safety data from a pooled analysis of studies where ovarian cancer patients 
received rucaparib monotherapy at the same posology, and therefore including also the ARIEL4 study 
(even if the treatment indication is no longer be approved). This is endorsed. In addition, potential cases 
of secondary MDS/AML are expected to be presented at the time of this final analysis.

7.4.  PSUR cycle  
Considering the marketing authorisation will no longer be subject to specific obligations, the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for rucaparib needs to be amended as follows: 
the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a yearly cycle from 20 December 2022. The next 
two  PSURs  will  cover  a  period  of  6  months  (20  December  2021-19  June  2022  and  20  June  2022  -  19 
December 2022 respectively). The following PSUR will then cover the period from 20 December 2022 to 
19 December 2023 to maintain alignment with the IBD.   
7.5.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
In view of the reported results from the ARIEL4 study DHPC were agreed by CHMP and sent to relevant 
healthcare professionals. The content of the letters was published on the EMA website on 06 May 2022 
and 8 August 2022. 
8.  PRAC advice 
During the assessment of the current variation application, in view of the results from the ARIEL4 study 
and the potential detrimental effect in OS observed with rucaparib over chemotherapy, PRAC advice was 
requested.  
The PRAC advice was adopted on 7 April 2022. The PRAC shared the concern of the CHMP, namely that 
the data from the OS interim analysis in the ARIEL4 study suggestive of a detrimental effect, were 
worrisome and that these data should be made available to health care professionals in a timely manner 
and recommended that this should be communicated by dissemination of a DHPC. PRAC recommended, 
as a first step, dissemination of a DHPC, to inform health care professionals of the OS data from the 
confirmatory ARIEL4 study. Subject to the CHMP assessment of the MAH’s responses to the list of 
outstanding issues, the PRAC noted that further regulatory actions may be warranted.  
A DHPC was adopted by CHMP on 22 April 2022 and dissemination of the DHPC to relevant healthcare 
professionals started on 5 May 2022 (see section 7.5). 
The CHMP adopted an opinion pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 on 21 July 2022 
recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for Rubraca (rucaparib). A 
second DHPC was sent to relevant healthcare professionals on 8 August 2022 (see section 7.5).  
9.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 6.2 with the submission of study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) CSR 
in fulfilment of Specific Obligation (SOB001) and removal of the treatment indication. 
The significant changes in the RMP are summarised below: 
Part II: Module SI – Epidemiology of the indication 
Removal of the ovarian cancer treatment indication. 
Part II: Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure 
Exposure in Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) was included according to the DLP of 30 Sep 2020.

Risk 
Important Identified Risks 
Myelosuppression 
Removed 
Reclassification  Rationale 
Data from ARIEL4 do not provide any new information, and the risk is well 
characterised and appropriately managed. There are no outstanding 
pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures. The 
measures to avoid the risk are adequately described in the product 
information. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC gives the following advice:  
Adverse reactions may be managed through dose interruptions and/or 
dose reductions for moderate to severe reactions (i.e. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) 
such as neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC gives the following advice:  
During treatment with rucaparib, events of myelosuppression (anaemia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) may be observed and are typically first 
observed after 8-10 weeks of treatment with rucaparib. These reactions 
are manageable with routine medical treatment and/ or dose adjustment 
for more severe cases. Complete blood count testing prior to starting 
treatment with Rubraca, and monthly thereafter, is advised. Patients 
should not start Rubraca treatment until they have recovered from 
haematological toxicities caused by previous chemotherapy (≤ CTCAE 
Grade 1). Supportive care and institutional guidelines should be 
implemented for the management of low blood counts for the treatment of 
anaemia, and neutropenia. Rubraca should be interrupted or dose reduced 
and blood counts monitored weekly until recovery. If the levels have not 
recovered to CTCAE grade 1 or better after 4 weeks, the patient should be 
referred to a haematologist for further investigations. 
before treatment with Rubraca 
every month during treatment with Rubraca 
The Patient Leaflet section 2 gives the following information:  
Your doctor or nurse will perform blood tests to check your blood cell-
counts: 
 
 
This is because Rubraca can cause low blood counts of red blood-cells, 
white blood-cells, or platelets.  
The signs and symptoms of low blood cell counts include fever, infection, 
bruising or bleeding. 
Your doctor may also do weekly tests, if you have low blood cell counts for 
a long time. They may stop treatment with Rubraca until your blood cell 
counts improve. 
The Patient Leaflet section 4 gives the following instructions/information:  
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects 
– you may need urgent medical treatment: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
 
being short of breath, feeling tired, having pale skin, or fast heart beat 
- these may be signs of a low red blood cell count (anaemia) 
bleeding or bruising for longer than usual if you hurt yourself - these 
may be signs of a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) 
fever or infection – these may be signs of a low white blood cell count 
(neutropenia) 
 
 
Nausea and 
vomiting 
Removed 
Data from ARIEL4 do not provide any new information, and the risk is well 
characterised and appropriately managed. There are no outstanding 
pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk minimisation measures. The 
measures to avoid the risk are adequately described in the product 
information. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC gives the following advice:  
Other moderate to severe non-haematological adverse reactions such as 
nausea and vomiting, can be managed through dose interruption and/or

reductions, if not adequately controlled by appropriate symptomatic 
management. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC gives the following advice:  
GI toxicities (nausea and vomiting) are frequently reported with rucaparib, 
are generally low grade (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2), and may be managed with 
dose reduction or interruption. Antiemetics, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine 
3 (5-HT3) antagonists, dexamethasone, aprepitant and fosaprepitant, can 
be used as treatment for nausea/vomiting and may also be considered for 
prophylactic (i.e., preventative) use prior to starting Rubraca. It is 
important to proactively manage these events to avoid prolonged or more 
severe events of nausea/vomiting which have the potential to lead to 
complications such as dehydration or hospitalisation. 
The Patient Leaflet section 2 gives the following instructions/information:  
Symptoms you should be aware of: Talk to your doctor if you feel sick 
(nauseous), have been sick (vomiting) or you have had diarrhoea. These 
may be signs and symptoms that Rubraca is affecting your stomach. 
The Patient Leaflet section 4 gives the following information:  
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 


being sick (vomiting) 
There is no indication from clinical trials (including the data from ARIEL4) 
and post-marketing experience that the safety profile with long-term use 
(i.e., longer than 18 months) is different from short-term use. In addition, 
there are no outstanding pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation 
measures activities to address this missing information. 
Based on the PSUR#5 assessment report 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010694/202012), the PRAC considered that the 
missing information can be removed from the list of safety concerns. 
There was a total of 108 post-marketing reports where the patient had 
prior treatment with olaparib or niraparib. The reported events appear to 
be in line with the known safety profile of PARP inhibitors and does not 
give raise to concern. Furthermore, efficacy data are not expected from 
post-marketing reports and the RMP does not include any post-marketing 
efficacy study to specifically address this issue.

Assessor’s comment: 
The proposal of the MAH to remove important identified risks ‘Myelosuppression’ and ‘Nausea and 
vomiting’ and missing information ‘Use in patients for longer than 18 months’ and ‘Efficacy and safety of 
rucaparib in patients previously treated with olaparib or another PARP inhibitor’ is supported.  
Both important identified risks (myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting) are well characterised and 
described in the SmPC. No new information was identified in ARIEL4 study. There are no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities ongoing or planned to further evaluate these risks.  
The MAH also proposes to remove missing information ‘Use in patients for longer than 18 months’ and 
‘Efficacy and safety of rucaparib in patients previously treated with olaparib or another PARP inhibitor’. 
The data from ARIEL4 confirmed that the safety of rucaparib with long-term use is comparable to that 
one with short-term use.  
Following assessment of the PSUR#5 it was stated that prior treatment with other PARP inhibitors 
(olaparib and niraparib) has had no impact on safety of rucaparib and it was recommended to remove 
these safety concerns from missing information.  
Part II: Module SVII.3.1 Presentation of important identified risks and important potential

9.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP and the changes to the conditions and obligations of the MA are acceptable. 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC  are  being  updated.  The  Package  Leaflet 
(PL) is updated accordingly. 
Changes are made to the Opinion Annex II conditions as detailed in the recommendations section above. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes and bring the PI in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.2 Rev.1. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all changes to the Product Information.

Clinical aspects 
1.  A HR of 1.55 (95% CI: 1.085, 2.214) for OS has been reported in the context of an IA performed with 
a 51% of data maturity (the final OS analysis seems to be planned with 70% of events). The provided 
explanation of the MAH that these results can be explained by the immaturity of the results and cross 
over are not convincing. Therefore, it should be further elucidated whether the reported OS data 
might reflect a detrimental effect of rucaparib. Updated OS data, further OS analyses and safety 
information should be submitted and discussed. At least the following is expected for both the efficacy 
population and the ITT population: 
a.  OS data by i) platinum sensitivity and ii) BRCA mutational status.  
b.  As the number of patients in the control arm is small, it may be that baseline covariates 
might impact the result. Therefore, the MAH should perform a multi-variate analysis 
modelling the impact of different baseline/prognostic factors on OS.

2.  The integrity of Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) can be questioned due to the very late protocol 
amendment performed at the same time of the data cut-off date, which modified the populations of 
analysis and removed PFS as assessed by BICR and OS from the step-down testing procedure. 
Therefore, the MAH is requested to provide further explanations/clarifications on how the integrity of 
the trial was maintained, including descriptions of who had access to what data at each point in the 
decision making process for the amendments as well as provide further justification for the 
amendments performed in the protocol and SAP. 
3.  As mentioned, PFS as assessed by BICR was changed from (key) secondary endpoint, to be tested as 
part of a step-down procedure, to a ‘stand-alone’ secondary endpoint. However, no analysis of irrPFS 
has been conducted/submitted by the MAH. No justification as to why data from this analysis should 
not be needed has been provided either. The MAH is requested to submit this (secondary) analysis for 
both the Efficacy and ITT Populations. 
4.  The MAH should provide previous versions of the SAP (if any) with tracked changes and justify the 
rationale behind relevant changes. 
5.  The fact that around 30% more patients discontinued due to radiological disease progression in the 
rucaparib arm as compared to the chemotherapy arm (i.e. 70.7% vs. 54.4%) is striking and deserves 
further discussion by the MAH.  
6.  The MAH should clarify if the reported OS interim analysis was pre-specified in the study protocol and 
SAP. 
7.  The MAH is requested to clarify the number of OS events needed for the final analysis and estimation 
of when it will be available. 
8.  Performing additional analyses using alternative relevant methods might be helpful to adjust for the 
reported crossover even if results from these analyses would be considered as supportive (bearing in 
mind their limitations as they mostly rely on underlying (strong) assumptions).  Reference is made to 
EMA guidance:  “Question and answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology 
trials (EMA/845963/2018)”. Results should be provided for both the efficacy population and the ITT 
population. Subgroup analyses according to stratification data should also be provided.   
9.  The MAH should submit and discuss OS and PFS2 results by stratification subgroups (i.e. by platinum 
sensitivity). 
10. The MAH should provide tabular information about subsequent anti-cancer therapies. 
11. The MAH is requested to submit final analysis for OS and PFS2 when available (REC already 
proposed).

12. As per protocol, patients in the chemotherapy arm, can receive up to 8 cycles. However, it seems 
that some patients received more than 8 cycles (median 5; range: 1, 21). The MAH should clarify the 
number of patients that received more than 8 cycles (if any). Further, the exact number of patients 
that completed 8 cycles should be provided. 
13. There were a total of 12 (5.2%) patients in the rucaparib arm while only 1 (0.9%) in the 
chemotherapy arm that reported an event of intestinal obstruction. Of these, 6 events in the 
rucaparib arm were considered as serious. In addition, 4 serious adverse events were reported 
among patients who crossed-over to rucaparib treatment The MAH is requested to provide further 
information on all the events of intestinal obstruction reported in the ARIEL4 study (as well as the 
pooled population) and discuss to what extent these events may be related to rucaparib treatment. 
14. The incidence of MDS/AML has been established based on a total of 2,972 patients treated with 
rucaparib in clinical trials. The MAH should specify to which studies (including a brief description) 
these patients come from.  
15. According to the MAH, the percentage of patients with QTcB and QTcF values ≥ 450 msec was 
typically < 20% and QTcB and QTcF ≥ 481 msec or ≥ 501 msec occurred in few patients in the 
rucaparib and chemotherapy groups across time points. In order to have a better comparison, a table 
summarising all events of QTcF and QTcB values ≥450 msec, QTcB values ≥481 msec and QTcB 
values ≥501 msec reported during the study in both the rucaparib and chemotherapy arms should be 
provided. 
16. Safety data by age, race, BRCA mutated gene and BRCA mutation status (germline and somatic) 
have been provided. For a proper assessment the MAH is requested to provide comparative data (in 
the same table) for all these subgroups. The same data currently provided are requested.  
17. Comparative data by platinum status of most frequent TESAEs, deaths and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation and dose reduction/interruption should be provided.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The responses to this question utilized the data cut-off of 30 September 2020. The pre-specified required 
maturity for final overall survival (OS) is at least 70% and the current OS maturity is 69%. Clovis 
anticipates that the final OS data will be available in May 2022 (with final clinical study report [CSR] 
submitted in Q4 2022). The preference is to run this analysis again at the time of final OS instead of 
conducting another interim OS analysis. 
a)  The OS data by i) platinum sensitivity and ii) breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutational status are 
presented below. 
The interim OS data by platinum sensitivity are summarized in Table 1 for both the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) and Efficacy Populations. These data were also presented and discussed in response to 
Question 9 and KM curves of the different subgroups are included in that question. 
Table 1. Study CO-338-043 Interim OS by Platinum Status – Treatment Part, ITT 
Population and Efficacy Population 
The interim OS by mutational status is summarized by BRCA-mutated gene in Table 2 and by 
BRCA mutation type in Table 3 for the ITT and Efficacy Populations.

There was no difference observed for interim OS between patients treated with either rucaparib 
or chemotherapy who were platinum-sensitive or partially platinum-sensitive at study entry in 
either the ITT or Efficacy Populations. The patients in the ITT Population who were platinum-
resistant and treated with chemotherapy appeared to have a longer OS (21.7 months) as 
compared to platinum-resistant patients treated with rucaparib (13.9 months), with similar 
results in the Efficacy Population. However, 39 of 59 patients (66%) in the platinum-resistant 
group (ITT Population) crossed over to receive rucaparib in the open-label Crossover Part of 
Study CO-338-043, thus appropriate analyses adjusting for confounding effects due to crossover 
are necessary to interpret the interim OS data. 
b)  As the number of patients in the control arm is small, it may be that baseline covariates might 
impact the result. Therefore, the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) should perform a multi-
variate analysis modelling the impact of different baseline/prognostic factors on OS. 
A stepwise Cox proportional multi-variate analysis of OS was evaluated with common 
demographic and baseline variables and also the randomized treatment allocation, a factor for 
crossover (Yes/No), and randomization strata of platinum status. The significance level used for 
the stepwise analysis was p = 0.20. The full model with all the potential demographics and 
baseline predictors and reduced model after stepwise prediction are presented in Table 4.

The variables found to be significant predictors in the model were stratification group by Platinum 
status, Patient crossed over (Yes/No), Randomized treatment (rucaparib vs chemotherapy), body 
mass index (BMI), Measurable disease, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance 
Status (ECOG PS) at baseline. Platinum status is a well-known prognostic factor of OS in ovarian 
cancer. The crossover and randomized treatment variables are consistent with the discussion 
around apparent confounding of OS results due to chemotherapy patients crossing over to receive

rucaparib. The crossover patients are likely to be associated with longer survival, since by design 
these patients are alive to enroll into the Crossover Part of Study CO-338-043. 
c)  A comprehensive presentation on the reasons for death should be provided to elucidate whether 
there is an imbalance in death due to adverse events. 
In the Study CO-338-043 clinical study report (CSR), all treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) leading to death during the Treatment Part were discussed. Fifteen patients (6.5%) in 
the rucaparib group and 3 patients (2.7%) in the chemotherapy group had at least 1 TEAE with 
an outcome of death. The most frequently reported TEAE with an outcome of death was 
malignant neoplasm progression (5 patients in the rucaparib group and 2 patients in the 
chemotherapy group). Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, such events were no 
longer collected in EDC. Overall, only 3 patients (1.3%) in the rucaparib group had a treatment-
related TEAE with an outcome of death compared with no patients in the chemotherapy group. 
These included events of Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), Cardiac disorder, and Death, not 
otherwise specified (NOS). The higher incidence of TEAEs with an outcome of death observed in 
the rucaparib group is likely due to these patients receiving treatment for a longer period, leading 
to events associated with disease progression. 
In addition to the TEAEs with an outcome of death, the primary reason for death was captured in 
the database for every OS event during the survival follow up. Table 5 summarizes the primary 
reasons for death for all patients who died in the OS analysis in the ITT Population, excluding 
those patients already described above who had a TEAE with an outcome of death during the 
Treatment Part of the study. 
Table 5. Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) Primary Reason of Death – Treatment Part, ITT 
Population Excluding Those Patients With TEAE Leading to Death 
There is no aparent imbalance between treatment arms in the proportion of patients who 
experienced a treatment-related TEAE that resulted in death. 
d)  Potential cases of secondary MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are expected to be presented.

In the Study CO-338-043 CSR, MDS/AML were identified as adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs). As of the visit cut-off for this report, 4 cases of MDS and 1 case of AML were reported for 
patients who received rucaparib in the Treatment Part of the study. A summary of the patients 
with MDS/AML is provided in Section 12.3.1.13 of the CSR. 
One patient who received rucaparib died during the Treatment Part of the study as a result of 
MDS. Two additional patients who were diagnosed with MDS (one while on treatment and the 
other during long-term follow up) died as a result of disease progression (disease under study). 
The remaining two patients were alive as of the CSR visit cut-off date (30 September 2020). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Due to the unexpected results obtained in the OS IA of study CO-338-043, the MAH was asked to provide 
updated OS data and supportive OS analyses to exclude a detrimental effect of rucaparib in patients’ 
survival. However, the MAH has chosen to wait until the final OS analysis, anticipated to take place in 
May 2022, where the requested analyses will be performed, instead of conducting another IA. For this 
reason, all the requested analyses have been presented based on the already reported OS IA, with a data 
cut-off date of 30 September 2020. 
a)  OS results by platinum sensitivity status have been provided for the ITT and the Efficacy Population. 
Reported HR for the Efficacy Population were 1.124 (95% CI: 0.438, 2.884) for the platinum-sensitive 
(PFI > 12 months) group, 1.258 (95% CI: 0.645, 2.454) for the partially platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 
to 12 months) group, and 1.789 (95% CI: 1.120, 2.858) for the platinum- resistant (PFI > 1 to <6 
months) group. For the ITT Population, in which only number of subjects included in the partially 
platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant group have changed, the estimated HR were 1.141 (95% 
CI: 0.618, 2.107) and 1.724 (95% CI: 1.128, 2.635) in the mentioned groups, respectively. Interim 
OS results by BRCA mutation were similar for both BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutation and for the Efficacy 
and ITT Population. In the Efficacy Population, HR (95% CI) were 1.469 (0.967, 2.233) for BRCA 1 
and 1.539 (0.754, 3.143) for BRCA 2. Consistent results were reported in the ITT Population. For the 
BRCA mutation type (germline vs. somatic), estimated HR for the Efficacy Population was 1.447 
(95%CI: 0.980, 2.135) in the group with germline BRCA mutation and 2.182 (95% CI: 0.846, 5.626) 
for the somatic BRCA mutation subgroup. Similar results were observed in the ITT Population. 
Focusing on median OS in all these groups of subjects, all the results favoured the chemotherapy 
arm, particularly in the subgroup of platinum-resistant patients but, again, due to the relatively high 
percentage of patients who crossed-over to rucaparib, interpretation of these results is difficult and 
additional sensitivity analyses are deemed necessary, see question 8. 
b)  A stepwise Cox proportional multi-variate analysis of OS was performed with demographic and 
baseline variables, the randomized treatment allocation, a factor for crossover and randomization 
strata of platinum sensitivity status. Of note, the significance level used was p=0.20. In this model, 
significant interaction was found for platinum status, patient crossed over (Yes/No), randomized 
treatment, BMI, measurable disease, and ECOG PS at baseline. The full model is not interpretable for 
the complexity and for the inclusion of too many variables, even those that are too far from the 
statistical significance level. The interpretation of the proposed reduced model which includes a 
patient crossover factor as a baseline variable is really difficult. In fact, crossover is not a baseline 
variable, actually it occurred always after randomisation. Thus, unfortunately, nothing beyond 
hypothesis generating can be concluded from this analysis. To better clarify the weight of possible 
imbalances in the baseline demographics and disease characteristics in these unexpected OS results, 
the MAH is requested to provide tabular summaries of these baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics at the time of randomization for three different subgroups of patients: patients 
randomized to rucaparib, patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to rucaparib after 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 116/234 
 
 
 
 
progression, and patients from the chemotherapy arm who did not cross over. Data for these 3 
subgroups should be included in the same table to facilitate assessment. 
c)  A tabular summary of primary reasons for death for the ITT Population excluding patients with a 
reported TEAE leading to death has been provided. A higher proportion of subjects in the rucaparib 
arm died due to other reasons, different from disease under study (9.8% vs. 4.2%). It is understood 
that these deaths were not reported as TEAEs because they occurred more than 28 days after last 
treatment dose. In this summary, there were 4 (3.6%) deaths and 1 (2.1%) death in the rucaparib 
and placebo arms, respectively, that were recorded as due to “unknown” reasons and 2 (1.8%) 
deaths and 1 (2.1%) death, respectively, due to “total body failure” which seem to be confusing 
terms. Other deaths attributed to more concrete reasons were reported in a higher frequency in the 
rucaparib arm. The rationale given by the MAH for these higher incidences to be related to longer 
study treatment duration in the rucaparib arm seems plausible. 
d)  As the analyses have been performed with the Sept-2020 data cut-off, no updated information has 
been provided regarding MDS/AML 
Conclusion 
Data requested have been provided, when available, and discussed. The MAH was also asked to conduct a 
multi-variate analysis modelling the impact of different baseline/prognostic factors on OS. This analysis 
has been presented but as discussed above it is difficult to interpret. Overall the HR of 1.55 (95% CI: 
1.085, 2.214) for OS reported in the context of an IA performed with a 51% of data maturity in study 
CO-338-043 is still not fully clarified, see also questions below, and remains of concern. With this in mind 
and while recognizing that i) the reported invPFS results in study CO-338-043 are to be regarded as the 
key data for confirmation of the positive benefit/risk of rucaparib in the initial (conditionally granted) 
indication (so that the agreed SOB at that time could be considered as fulfilled) and ii) that taking into 
account the design of the trial it appears likely that the OS results will in the end remain inconclusive, 
some further analyses are still requested in order to get further clarification of the unexpected OS results 
reported in study CO-338-043 before a final decision for this procedure is drawn. These are requested as 
other concerns, see questions below.  
Issue partly solved. Additional OCs are posed.

Question 2 
The integrity of Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL 4) can be questioned due to the very late protocol amendment 
performed at the same time of the data cut-off date, which modified the populations of analysis and 
removed PFS as assessed by BICR and OS from the step-down testing procedure. Therefore, the MAH is 
requested to provide further explanations/clarifications on how the integrity of the trial was maintained, 
including descriptions of who had access to what data at each point in the decision making process for the

amendments as well as provide further justification for the amendments performed in the protocol and 
SAP. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Amendment 2 of the Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) protocol was initiated prior to the data cut-off date and 
was finalized prior to the Clovis team having access to aggregate data and performing the blind break. 
The integrity of Study CO-338-043 was maintained by following a blinding plan and relying on an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to monitor progression-free survival (PFS) event 
maturity and by prohibiting Clovis access to aggregate data by treatment assignment until the blind break 
was performed by Clovis on 15 December 2020, as specified in the blinding plan. 
The Clovis Biostatistics group did not have access to treatment assignments throughout the study until 
blind break. To monitor and review study data, the Clovis Clinical Operations and Clinical Development 
staff had access to individual patient data but not to any aggregate study results by treatment arm. 
To monitor the study, the IDMC had access to the complete set of unblinded aggregate study data 
throughout the conduct of Study CO-338-043. An independent biostatistician at AXIO Research (Seattle, 
Washington, US), contracted for independent statistical support of the IDMC, was responsible for 
compiling the data and generating the necessary tables, listings, and figures for the IDMC review. In 
addition, Clovis contracted with EMB Statistical Solutions, LLC (Overland Park, Kansas US), an 
independent statistical vendor for Study CO-338-043, to produce the statistical package and tables, 
listings, and figures (TLFs) for the clinical study report (CSR). EMB Statistical Solutions received all clinical 
study data including the various vendor data for Study CO-338-043. Data sets and TLFs were not shared 
with Clovis until the official release of treatment codes on 15 December 2020. 
In August 2020, the ARIEL4 IDMC communicated that the required number of PFS events (n = 275) were 
projected to be achieved by September 2020 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The IDMC also 
acknowledged that both the protocol and the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) excluded patients with a 
breast cancer gene (BRCA) reversion mutation from the primary analysis but questioned the value of 
delaying the readout until the BRCA reversion mutation data were available. After receiving the 
communication from the IDMC, Clovis made a decision to expedite the BRCA reversion mutation testing 
and in parallel to amend the Study CO-338-043 protocol (ie, prepare Amendment 2) to include a 
hierarchical step-down procedure to adjust for the multiple testing of primary endpoints and key 
secondary endpoints starting with the Efficacy population (which excluded patients with BRCA reversion 
mutations) and followed by the ITT Population. The original protocol for Study CO-338-043 and 
Amendment 1 had not pre-specified this multiplicity adjustment, thus Amendment 2 was finalized prior to 
release of treatment codes and aggregate study results. 
The sequence of events that occurred after the notification from the IDMC in August 2020 and the 
specifics of who had access to which data at different timepoints is summarized in Table 1.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided a tabular timeline of the events related to the dabase lock and the treatment 
unblinding for the sponsor. According to them, no access to any aggregate study results by treatment 
arm took place before the blind break, performed on 15 December 2020. The IDMC communicated to the 
sponsor that the required events for the primary endpoint analysis were expected to be reached in 
September. At this time, the IDMC  noted that the protocol stated that patients with a BRCA reversion 
mutation were to be excluded from the efficacy analyses but, apparently, the reversion mutation tumour

samples testing had not been done. From that date in August to October, the samples testing was 
performed, at the same time that Amendment 2 was being prepared. This amendment 2 was finalized on 
the 23 October 2020 and also the SAP was dated on the 28 October. Finally, the BRCA reversion mutation 
data was available on the 11 December and the unblinding took place on the 15 December, applying the 
already mentioned 30 September 2020 data cut-off. 
It is acknowledged that the original protocol already stated that subjects with a BRCA reversion mutation 
should be excluded from the main efficacy analyses, therefore the changes applied in Amendment 2 
regarding the analyses populations (Efficacy and ITT) and the hierarchical testing methodology seem to 
be justified. In the same way, it is not understood why the reversion mutation samples testing had not 
been performed before if this information was needed for the efficacy analyses and this caused a delay in 
the read-out of the results. Furthermore, the rationale behind removing OS from the step-down testing 
procedure based on the expected immaturity of the OS data at the time of the primary endpoint analysis 
can be followed but this could have also been anticipated at the time of the Amendment 1 avoiding this 
late modification of the study main endpoints. 
In conclusion, the timeline of events and access to data is acknowlegded but it does not exclude the 
possibility that the late protocol amendment and SAP could have been data-driven. However, it seems 
highly unlikely that the study results could have been different without the applied changes. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Question 3 
As mentioned, PFS as assessed by BICR was changed from (key) secondary endpoint, to be tested as part 
of a step-down procedure, to a ‘stand-alone’ secondary endpoint. However, no analysis of irrPFS has been 
conducted/submitted by the MAH. No justification as to why data from this analysis should not be needed 
has been provided either. The MAH is requested to submit this (secondary) analysis for both the Efficacy 
and ITT Populations.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Investigator-assessed PFS (invPFS) was selected by the MAH as the primary efficacy endpoint to allow 
real-time evaluation and determination of disease progression in Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4). The lack of 
a delay in evaluation of disease progression not only alleviated the potential of informative censoring 
bias, but it also allowed investigators to make timely, medically-informed decisions regarding the best 
clinical course for their patients. In this way, the MAH considered that the determination of invPFS rather 
than BICR PFS allowed a more reliable assessment of benefit/risk. 
The MAH decided not to analyze the secondary endpoint of BICR PFS following a review of study 
publications while Study CO-338-043 was ongoing. Recent data in ovarian cancer trials demonstrated 
different results between the duration of local investigator- and BICR-assessed median progression-free 
survival (mPFS). When local investigator review alone indicated disease progression, generally, no further 
assessments were carried out and patients were censored in the BICR analysis, thus leading to 
informative censoring. As a result of this informative censoring, BICR may be less reliable and have the 
tendency to exaggerate the mPFS, whereas investigator-assessed PFS provides a more conservative 
approach. 
As noted by the CHMP, the existing body of efficacy data from Study CO-338-043 are consistent with the 
data obtained from the pooled Efficacy Population from Study CO-338-010 and Study CO-338-017. Based 
on the considerations above, the MAH does not consider the absence of BICR PFS as a limitation in 
confirming these data. The MAH therefore maintains its decision to have not performed BICR PFS 
analyses at the time of the blind break and preparation of the CSR.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has not performed the requested PFS by BICR analysis for the same reasons that were already 
specified in the initial submission: high differences between PFS by investigator and BICR have been 
reported in previous ovarian cancer trials with PARP inhibitors. The solution, though, cannot be not 
performing such analysis but trying to identify the reasons behind the observed differences. The analysis 
of this endpoint was included in all versions of the protocol although its timing was not specified. As 
mentioned in the initial report, this analysis is considered of particular relevance for this pathology, even 
more in the context of an open-label design and, at least, results from an ‘audit’ sample to 
assess/confirm concordance would have been expected, therefore the justification provided by the MAH is 
not valid and the results should be provided at the time of the OS final analysis. 
Conclusion 
Issue not solved. PFS by BICR analysis results are expected to be provided at the time of the 
final OS analysis, which is projected to occur later this year (REC). 
Question 4 
The MAH should provide previous versions of the SAP (if any) with tracked changes and justify the 
rationale behind relevant changes.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) v1.0 signed and dated on 28 October 2020 was submitted as part of 
the Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) Clinical Study Report (CSR). This is the first and only version of the SAP. 
The SAP aligned with Section 11 Planned Statistical Methods in the effective ARIEL4 protocol Amendment 
2 (dated 23 October 2020), and elaborated on the already-specific details of the planned statistical 
methods written in protocol Section 11. According to the MAH, they worked closely with an independent 
data monitoring committee (IDMC) and remained blinded to aggregate output results until 15 December 
2020 (Section 6.5 of the Study CO-338-043 CSR). Thus, Clovis finalized and signed the SAP on 28 
October 2020 prior to Clovis being unblinded to study results on 15 December 2020. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has confirmed that the submitted SAP v1.0 is the first and only version, which was signed, along 
with Amendment 2, after the data cut-off date but before the data unblinding for the sponsor. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Question 5 
The fact that around 30% more patients discontinued due to radiological disease progression in the 
rucaparib arm as compared to the chemotherapy arm (i.e. 70.7% vs. 54.4%) is striking and deserves 
further discussion by the MAH. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The discrepancy between the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment due to radiologic disease 
progression in the rucaparib arm as compared to the chemotherapy arm is largely due to the fact that 
rucaparib was allowed to be administered until disease progression, whereas chemotherapy was often 
administered for a set number of cycles. The platinum-based regimens were capped at 8 cycles 
maximum. Patients receiving weekly paclitaxel could continue treatment until disease progression or 
other reason for discontinuation. However, some patients received weekly paclitaxel treatment cycles for 
a set number of cycles according to institutional or local guidelines, consistent with data indicating that 
discontinuation of study drug was due to completion of treatment. To also note, more patients receiving 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 121/234 
 
 
 
 
platinum-based regimens and weekly paclitaxel treatment discontinued treatment due to an adverse 
event than patients receiving rucaparib. 
Twenty-one (19.4%) patients randomized to chemotherapy discontinued treatment with a primary reason 
of having completed their maximum allowed number of treatment cycles. Details regarding 12 patients in 
the chemotherapy arm who received >8 cycles of treatment (all with weekly paclitaxel) are provided in 
the response to question 12. 
Most patients in the chemotherapy arm did not experience disease progression while receiving treatment, 
ie, who had stable disease or better upon treatment discontinuation. Patients in the chemotherapy arm 
were not allowed to cross over to open-label rucaparib until they had a disease progression event. The 
number of patients with progression-free survival (PFS) events is balanced in the study and present in a 
high proportion in both treatment arms; PFS events are 81.9% (95/116) for chemotherapy and 77.7% 
(181/233) for rucaparib in the ITT population. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
According to the MAH, the observed imbalance between treatment arms for patients who discontinued 
treatment due to disease progression was due to the fact that patients in the chemotherapy arm could 
only receive a limited number of treatment cycles (except for patients receiving weekly paclitaxel) and 
this was not the case for the rucaparib arm where the treatment was to continue until disease 
progression. There were 21 (19.4%) subjects from the chemotherapy arm who discotinued treatment due 
to “treatment completed” which means they had already received eight cycles but had not progressed on 
it. Considering the response to this question and to question 12, there must be some patients who did not 
receive the maximun allowed number of cycles but that were considered not candidates to receive more 
than 4 or 6 cycles which is compatible with current clinical practice in these heavily treated patients. This 
could explain the observed imbalance. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 6 
The MAH should clarify if the reported OS interim analysis was pre-specified in the study protocol and 
SAP.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The reported overall survival (OS) interim analysis was prespecified prior to the blind break that occurred 
on 15 December 2020. It is described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), Section 10.3.2 Interim 
Overall Survival, and includes a prespecified stopping rule and the adjustment for the final OS analysis. 
It was anticipated that the data for OS would be heavily censored at the time of the initial CSR analysis. 
In order to adjust for multiple analyses of OS at a later stage, a stopping rule will be applied. The 
Haybittle-Peto stopping rule will be applied where an interim OS result with a p-value <0.001 can be used 
to claim superiority of rucaparib compared to chemotherapy. This means that a p-value very close to 0.05 
can be utilized at the final analysis which is projected to be once at least 70% of the death events have 
been collected. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
According to the MAH, the reported OS IA was established in the SAP v1.0 although there is not a specific 
reference to the fact that this was an interim analysis, except for the section title. The previous protocol 
version stated that “if the primary  endpoint is statistically significant, then OS will be tested” but OS was 
considered a key secondary endpoint at that time. The SAP v1.0 anticipates that OS data would be 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 122/234 
 
 
 
 
heavily censored at the time of the initial CSR analysis and establishes a stopping rule to claim superiority 
an to adjust for multiple analyses of OS at a later stage. This can be interpreted as defining this initial OS 
analysis (CSR) as an interim analysis with a prespecified p-value <0.001 to claim superiority of rucaparib 
versus chemotherapy. However, the fact that the SAP and protocol version were finalized after the data 
cut-off date raise concern, as already pointed out in this report. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Question 7 
The MAH is requested to clarify the number of OS events needed for the final analysis and estimation of 
when it will be available.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The final overall survival (OS) will be evaluated when at least 70% of the events have been collected, 
which was prespecified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Section 10.3.2 Interim Overall Survival. 
Thus, the number of events needed are 245 deaths within the 349 randomized patients in Study CO-338-
043 (ARIEL4). Clovis is utilizing an independent statistical vendor (AXIO Research [Seattle, Washington, 
US]) to maintain the overall blind of death data and also estimate when final OS events will be reached. 
The current OS maturity is 69% and the current projected estimate for collecting at least 70% of OS 
events is approximately May 2022. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested information. The final OS analysis will be performed when 245 
deaths are reported which is expected to occur in May 2022, approximately. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 8 
Performing additional analyses using alternative relevant methods might be helpful to adjust for the 
reported crossover even if results from these analyses would be considered as supportive (bearing in 
mind their limitations as they mostly rely on underlying (strong) assumptions).  Reference is made to 
EMA guidance:  “Question and answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology 
trials (EMA/845963/2018)”. Results should be provided for both the efficacy population and the ITT 
population. Subgroup analyses according to stratification data should also be provided.    
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As suggested in the EMA guidance EMA/845963/2018, exploration of statistical models that adjust for 
crossover should be used. As can be seen in the Kaplan-Meier survival plot in Figure 1, these groups 
produce 3 distinct non-crossing survival curves, which suggests that employing a time-adjusted Cox 
Proportional Hazards model may be an appropriate and useful way to further explore the confounding OS 
results.

Proportional Hazards model that adjusts for randomization strata (Platinum sensitivity status as (1) 
“Platinum-resistant”, (2) “Platinum-sensitive”, or (3) “Partially platinum-sensitive”) and a time-adjusted 
parameterization of the treatment effect as defined below: 
1.  Defined crossover patients as patients who progressed under chemotherapy and subsequently 
crossed over to rucaparib. Note, this means that only patients assigned to chemotherapy are 
eligible to be crossover patients, as per the protocol. Crossover patients spend Tchemo months 
on chemotherapy (time from study enrollment to crossover), followed by Tparp time on rucaparib 
(time from crossover to death/censoring). 
2.  Included a time-varying covariate X(t) in the Cox Proportional Hazards model, defined as: 
X(t)=0 if patient has not received rucaparib at time t 
X(t)=1 if patient is receiving rucaparib at time t 
Note that X(t≤Tchemo)=0 and X(t>Tchemo)=1 for crossover patients. X reduces to a constant for non-
crossover patients: for all t, X(t)=0 for non-crossover chemotherapy patients and X(t)=1 for patients 
receiving rucaparib. 
This parameterization of the treatment effect allows information to be shared between patients who 
received rucaparib, regardless of initial treatment assignment. If we allow the baseline treatment 
assignment to be parameterized such that rucaparib is the reference group (meaning that the baseline 
treatment assignment effect Z is such that Z=0 if baseline treatment assignment is rucaparib, and Z=1 if 
chemotherapy), then the “overall” rucaparib effect on overall survival can be estimated by the covariate 
associated with X(t).
Similarly, the “overall” chemotherapy effect can be estimated by the covariate 
associated with
Z. 
Note, that a patient assigned to chemotherapy will have their hazard ratio (HR) changed according to the 
coefficient associated with Z=1. Similarly, a patient assigned to rucaparib will have their HR changed 
according to the coefficient associated with X(
)=1. Finally, a crossover patient will have their HR changed 
by the coefficient associated with Z=1 for t≤Tchemo, and then their hazard will be changed by an additional 
amount according to the coefficient associated with X(
)=1.

Because of this, to directly compare chemotherapy to rucaparib, a custom hypothesis test must be 
performed comparing Z=1 vs. X(t)=1. This is because we need to compare “being on chemotherapy” 
(equivalently [Z=1] + [X(t)=0] = [Z=1]) vs. “being on rucaparib” (equivalently [Z=0] + [X(t)=1] = 
[X(t)=1]). 
The results of the parametrization of the time-adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards model described above 
for the ITT population (N=349) are presented in Table 4. 
Table 4. Cox Proportional Hazards Model Adjusted for Platinum Status in Study CO-338-043 – 
ITT Population 
Note, that randomized treatment assignment of chemotherapy is associated with a statistically significant 
decrease in hazard. Beginning rucaparib at time t (including subjects who started rucaparib at baseline 
when t = 0), is also associated with a decrease in hazard. Thus, crossover patients benefit from both the 
decrease attributed to (1) being randomized to chemotherapy assignment as well as then (2) 
subsequently receiving rucaparib. As expected, the covariate for platinum status is also statistically 
significant for overall survival. 
Using the same model, similar results are seen in the Efficacy Population (N=325) presented in Table 5.  
Table 5. Cox Proportional Hazards Model Adjusted for Platinum Status in Study CO-338-043 – 
Efficacy Population 
Exploring OS in subgroups based on platinum status was performed using the same time-adjusted Cox 
Proportional Hazards model within each subgroup but without the stratification factor in the model. The 
results for this model are presented in Table 4. Note that the platinum-resistant subgroup (N=179) seems 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 126/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to have a strong effect for decreasing the hazard for both chemotherapy and rucaparib (p-values <0.01 
and <0.10 respectively), but the other subgroups (N=96 partially platinum-sensitive and N=74 platinum-
sensitive) do not seem to have any notable effect. 
Table 6. Cox Proportional Hazards Model Analysis for Stratification Factor of Platinum Status 
Subgroups in Study CO-338-043 – ITT Population 
Using the time-adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards model described above for the ITT and Efficacy 
Population and Platinum status subgroups a direct comparison of chemotherapy vs. rucaparib (eg, Z=1 
vs. X(t)=1) was performed using a CONTRAST statement in SAS. The models for all the populations and 
subgroups yielded a non-significant treatment difference (HR<1 is in favor of chemotherapy, HR>1 is in 
favor of rucaparib) as displayed in Table 7. These results show that there is not a statistically significant 
difference in OS when comparing chemotherapy directly to rucaparib for any subgroup. Because of this, 
and in addition to the large increase in OS seen in patients receiving both rucaparib and chemotherapy, it 
is possible that there is an additive benefit from both treatments, especially among platinum-resistant 
patients. 
On the other hand, it is important to recall that a key limitation of this modelling approach is that it is a 
post-hoc analysis of OS among patients who had the potential to crossover. Any such analysis will be 
inherently biased by the fact that for a patient to crossover they must have survived long enough/been 
“healthy enough” to do so.

Study CO-338-043 
Assessment report

Page 127/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, OS is highly confounded due to high proportion of patients who crossed over by first being 
treated with chemotherapy and then subsequently received rucaparib in open-label crossover portion of 
the trial. When modeled with a time-dependent Cox Proportional Hazards model, the variable of 
beginning rucaparib did not reach statistical significance, but the HR was <1 (favourable) for the ITT 
population and the Efficacy population. 
The pre-specified required maturity for final OS is at least 70% and the current OS maturity is 69%. 
Further exploratory analyses will be provided when the final OS will be reported in Q4 2022 (see response 
to question 11). The above analyses support that being treated with rucaparib at any timepoint is a good 
alternative option for these patients. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH was requested to provide additional supportive analyses to adjust for the reported crossover in 
the study. Using available EMA guidance was suggested in this respect, and it was therefore expected 
that the MAH would have submitted results from analysis(es) proposed in such document. Instead of 
that, the MAH considers that as a result of the cross-over, three distinct non-crossing survival curves can 
be observed and that employing a time-adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards model is appropiate to further 
explore the confounding OS results. This method has been applied for the ITT, the Efficacy Population and 
the platinum status subgroups.There are 2 factors which assess the treatment effect in this model: the Z 
fixed factor for the randomisation to the control arm and the time-dependent X factor for the exposure to 
Rucaparib at any time. This approach has several methodological concerns.  
First, the two treatment factors are being influenced by each other. While this model might be used as 
one of among a list of analyses, it is difficult to determine which one could be considered more 
appropriate post-hoc. The objective in that analysis should likely be the effect of the exposure to 
rucaparib (the X factor) at any time without the effect of the randomisation. It might be argued that this 
imply losing the randomised therapeutical strategy, but in fact this is also lost in the presented model by 
using the time-dependent (post-randomisation) factor. This means that any of the analyses including 
post-baseline variables is subject to potential confounders and biases, such as the patient status at the 
moment of the decision to crossover or not. This analysis should be considered as in the context of 
observational methods rather a sensitivity analysis of a randomised experiment, and as so, the addition 
of more covariates, some of them time-dependent, would be needed. The analysis provided should be 
supplemented with a series of analysis with and without the fixed Z factor and the use of covariates, in 
particular including those measuring the patient status and the severity of the disease at crossover.  
In essence this will give a range of scenarios, which apparently will be helpful for the understanding of 
the crossover on the OS. However, the Applicant is referred again to the EMA guidance “Question and 
answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology trials (EMA/845963/2018)”. In this 
sense, they are strongly requested to provide the analysis censoring the data at crossover and at least 1 
or 2 (preferable all 3) of the proposed methods for handling crossover.

Conclusion 
Issue not solved. 
Question 9 
The MAH should submit and discuss OS and PFS2 results by stratification subgroups (i.e. by platinum 
sensitivity).  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
At the time of visit cutoff for Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4), overall survival (OS) data were at 51% 
maturity (51% of events), with the final readout for OS planned per the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), 
Section 10.3.2, when 70% maturity has been reached. The following presentation of the OS and, in the 
subsequent line of treatment, the second event of progression-free survival (PFS2) results by 
stratification subgroups therefore remains interim and immature and will be updated at the time of final 
OS analysis. The interim results for OS and PFS2 by each subgroup based on the randomization 
stratification variable of platinum status (ie, platinum-resistant, partially platinum-sensitive, platinum-
sensitive) are summarized for the intent-to-treat (ITT) Population in Table 8. Similarly, OS and PFS2 are 
summarized by platinum status for the Efficacy Population in Table 9.

Population

Table 9. Study CO-338-043 Interim OS and PFS2 by Platinum Status – Treatment Part, Efficacy 
Population 
The distribution of patients who crossed over from the chemotherapy arm to rucaparib treatment in the 
open-label phase (N=74) is displayed by platinum status at the time of randomization in Table 10 below.  
Table 10. Study CO-338-043 Proportion of Patients by Strata of Platinum Status at Time of 
Randomization - Patients Who Crossed Over to Rucaparib in the Crossover Part 
In conclusion, this interim OS analysis showed no difference between patients treated with either 
rucaparib or chemotherapy who were platinum-sensitive or partially platinum-sensitive at study entry in 
Assessment report

either the ITT or Efficacy Populations. This confirms that rucaparib can offer an effective, alternative 
nonplatinum-based treatment option for ovarian cancer patients with platinum-sensitive disease. The 
patients in the ITT Population who were platinum resistant and treated with chemotherapy appeared to 
have a longer OS (21.7 months) as compared to platinum-resistant patients treated with rucaparib (13.9 
months), with similar results observed in an analysis of the Efficacy Population. Given, however, that 
39/59 (66%) patients in the platinum-resistant group (ITT Population), initially treated with 
chemotherapy, crossed over to receive rucaparib in the open-label Crossover Part of Study CO-338-043, 
appropriate analyses adjusting for confounding effects due to crossover are needed. Please see response 
to question 8 for further details on the adjustment of the treatment effect for the Crossover Part. 
The interim PFS2 did not show any difference between patients initially randomized to rucaparib or 
chemotherapy in the treatment phase who were platinum-sensitive, partially platinum-sensitive, or 
platinum-resistant at study entry in either the ITT or Efficacy Populations. The PFS2 analyses can be seen 
as a simplistic approach to evaluate the time to relapse for two different sequences of treatments 
(patients treated with rucaparib followed by chemotherapy vs patients initially randomized to 
chemotherapy followed by PARP-inhibitor due to crossover) and the overall results indicate that there 
seems to be no difference in efficacy.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It is acknowledged that the reported OS results remain immature but, considering that the presented OS 
analysis has been performed with the 51% of events (final OS analysis planned at 70% of events), some 
information can be extracted. For the ITT and Efficacy Population, OS results by platinum status have 
already be included in the response to the MO (question 1). PFS2 results, for the ITT Population, favoured 
the rucaparib arm for the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup (HR = 0.685 [95% CI: 0.407, 1.153] 
p=0.1544); which is the subgroup of most interest in the context of the confirmation exercise for the 
results on which the initial conditional approval for rucaparib was based. For the platinum-sensitive 
subgroup the reported HR for PFS2 was of 0.995 ([95% CI: 0.472, 2.100] p=0.990) and for the 
platinum-resistant subgroup, the estimated HR was 1.029 ([95% CI: 0.721, 1.468]), p=0.8763 and the 
median PFS2 in this subgroup was 10.9 (8.5, 13.1) months for the rucaparib arm and 11.3 (8.8, 15.2) 
months for the chemotherapy treatment arm. Consistent results were found for the Efficacy Population 
except for the fact that, in the platinum-resistant subgroup, the HR was below 1 (HR= 0.983 [95% CI: 
0.671, 1.441] p=0.9301). Also, the median PFS2 for this subgroup were similar between arms. From the 
74 subjects from the placebo arm who crossed over to receive rucaparib, the highest proportion (52.7%) 
of subjects correspond to the platinum-resistant subgroup, which is to be expected, the same for the 
shorter PFS2 , as their response to further treatments is supposed to be more limited. Overall, the results 
for the exploratory endpoint of PFS2 are consistent with the already commented OS findings. 
Conclusion 
The requested data has been provided and therefore the issue is considered solved. 
Question 10 
The MAH should provide tabular information about subsequent anti-cancer therapies.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Assessment report

Page 134/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the time of the clinical study report (CSR) visit cut-off (30 September 2020), a total of 57.3% 
(200/349) patients had reported at least one regimen of subsequent anti-cancer treatment (SAT). The 
breakdown of reasons for those patients without SAT data recorded are found in Table 11.The presented 
data is reflective of the state of the data collection at the time of the CSR visit cut-off date. 
Table 11. Summary of Patients With and Without Subsequent Anti-cancer Treatment (Visit cut-
off 30-Sept-2020) 
For those patients with SAT, the first and second SAT regimens are broadly summarized by the following 
7 categories: 
• 
• 
• 
Poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor or PARP-inhibitor 
combination (treatment with either single-agent rucaparib, niraparib or olaparib, or rucaparib plus 
nivolumab and ipilumumab) 
Platinum combination chemotherapy (at least one agent was carboplatin, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin 
plus a non-platinum chemotherapy agent), and with or without bevacizumab or hormonal 
therapies 
Platinum monotherapy (single-agent platinum; includes switch between carboplatin and cisplatin 
for tolerability reasons) 
•  Non-platinum combination chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab or hormonal therapies 
(eg. doxorubicin plus gemcitabine, paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, liposomal doxorubicin plus 
trabectedin, cyclophosphamide, methrotrexate plus anastrozole) 
•  Hormonal therapy (eg, single agent tamoxifen, anastrozole) 
• 
• 
Immunotherapy (eg, avelumab, atezolizumab) 
Investigational or Unknown anti-cancer treatments 
The first and second regimens are summarized in Table 2. Upon confirmation of disease progression 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, patients who had been 
randomized to the chemotherapy arm could crossover to receive rucaparib under open-label treatment. 
Given that all patients enrolled into Study SO-338-043 (ARIEL4) had a deleterious breast cancer gene 
(BRCA) mutation, it is not unexpected that 91.7% (78/85) of patients in the chemotherapy arm received 
Assessment report

subsequent treatment with a PARP-inhibitor upon disease progression, the vast majority receiving 
rucaparib treatment. 
For those patients who were randomized to the rucaparib arm in the Treatment Part of the Study CO-
338-043, and whose disease progressed, nearly all of these patients received a subsequent 
chemotherapy regimen, with the majority receiving platinum-based treatment (56.5%; 65/115 patients) 
and a slightly smaller percentage receiving non-platinum chemotherapy treatment (37.4%; 43/115 
patients). Platinum-based regimens were the most frequent first SATs in patients who were partially 
platinum-sensitive or platinum-sensitive at baseline initially randomized to rucaparib. Of 120 patients who 
were considered platinum-resistant at baseline and were randomized to the rucaparib arm, 45.8% 
(55/120) patients had received a first SAT at the time of data cut-off. Interestingly, despite these 
patients being platinum-resistant, 21/55 (38.2%) patients received platinum-based chemotherapy as 
monotherapy or in combination therapy, while 31/55 (56.4%) patients received a nonplatinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen and 2 (3.6%) patients received hormonal therapy. 
At the time of the CSR visit cut-off date, 89 patients had received a second SAT regimen. Of 51 patients 
originally randomized to the rucaparib arm, and who already received one subsequent chemotherapy 
regimen, the majority of these patients 62.7% (32/51) received further chemotherapy, with a shift to 
nonplatinum-based regimens either as monotherapy or as combination. For the chemotherapy arm, in 
which the majority of patients received rucaparib as their first SAT regimen, nearly 90% of those patients 
who continued to a second SAT regimen (n = 38) received chemotherapy as their next treatment 
regimen.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Up to the data cut-off date (30 Sept 2020), a total of 200 (57.3%) patients received, at least, one 
subsequent anti-cancer treatment, 115 (49.4%) in the rucaparib arm and 85 (73.3%) in the placebo arm, 
which is supposed to include the 74 patients in the chemotherapy arm who crossed-over to received 
rucaparib after progression. The most common subsequent therapy received in the rucaparib arm was a 
platinum-based combination while in the chemotherapy arm, most patients received a PARP inhibitor. 
There were 37 (32.2%)  patients in the rucaparib arm who received non-platinum monotherapy, which 
could correlate to the number of platinum-resistant subjects who received later therapy, although 
according to the MAH there were 21 patients considered platinum-resistant that received platinum 
chemotherapy as subsequent therapy.  
In addition to these data, there were a total of 89 (25.5%)  subjects who received two or more 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy. In this later stage, the type of therapy received was more varied, as can 
be found in clinical practice. It does not seem that rucaparib treatment prevent patients from receiving 
posterior anti-cancer treatments.

Question 11 
The MAH is requested to submit final analysis for OS and PFS2 when available (REC already proposed).  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As acknowledged by the CHMP, an updated Letter of Recommendation was included with the initial 
variation package reflecting the MAH’s commitment to submit an addendum to the Study CO-338-043 
clinical study report (CSR), incorporating overall survival (OS) and second event of progression-free 
survival (PFS2) final analyses, when available. The MAH estimates it will be able to submit the final 
analyses of OS and PFS2 as a CSR addendum in Q4 2022 via the appropriate regulatory procedure. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided an updated Letter of Recommendation including the MAH’s commitment to submit 
an addendum to the Study CO-338-043 clinical study report (CSR), incorporating overall survival (OS) 
and second event of progression-free survival (PFS2) final analyses, with an estimated date of Q4 2022.

Clinical safety 
Question 12 
As per protocol, patients in the chemotherapy arm, can receive up to 8 cycles. However, it seems that 
some patients received more than 8 cycles (median 5; range: 1, 21). The MAH should clarify the number 
of patients that received more than 8 cycles (if any). Further, the exact number of patients that 
completed 8 cycles should be provided. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The median number of treatment cycles received in the chemotherapy arm was 5 cycles (range: 1, 21). 
Per protocol, the restriction to a maximum of 8 cycles applied only to platinum-containing regimens to be 
consistent with standard of care and limit cumulative platinum toxicity. Patients receiving weekly 
paclitaxel could continue treatment until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation. For 
some patients, the maximum number of cycles of weekly paclitaxel treatment cycles was determined by 
institutional or local guidelines, consistent with data indicating that discontinuation of study drug was due 
to completion of treatment. All patients who received more than 8 cycles of chemotherapy on the study 
were receiving weekly paclitaxel. 
Of the 88 patients who received weekly paclitaxel, the median number of cycles received was 5 (range: 
1, 21). Twelve (13.6%) patients received > 8 cycles with 3 patients each receiving 9 and 10 cycles 
respectively, and single patients each receiving 11, 12, 14, 15, 20 and 21 cycles respectively. 
Of the 25 patients who received platinum monotherapy or doublet therapy, only 3 (12%) received the 
maximum 8 cycles. Of 9 patients receiving platinum monotherapy, the median number of cycles received 
was 6 (range: 4, 8). Of 16 patients receiving platinum doublet, the median number of cycles received was 
5 (range: 2, 8).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
According to the MAH, the restriction to a maximum of 8 cycles applied only to platinum-containing 
regimens and all patients that received more than 8 cycles of chemotherapy were receiving weekly 
paclitaxel. The median number of cycles in patients that received platinum monotherapy (n=9) and 
platinum doublet (n=16) was, respectively, 6 (range: 4, 8) and 5 (range: 2, 8). Among the 88 patients 
that received weekly paclitaxel, there were 12 (13.6%) patients that received >8 cycles. 
Conclusion

Question 13 
There were a total of 12 (5.2%) patients in the rucaparib arm while only 1 (0.9%) in the chemotherapy 
arm that reported an event of intestinal obstruction. Of these, 6 events in the rucaparib arm were

considered as serious. In addition, 4 serious adverse events were reported among patients who crossed-
over to rucaparib treatment The MAH is requested to provide further information on all the events of 
intestinal obstruction reported in the ARIEL4 study (as well as the pooled population) and discuss to what 
extent these events may be related to rucaparib treatment.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Overall, the incidence of intestinal obstruction (preferred terms [PTs]: intestinal obstruction, small 
intestinal obstruction, large intestinal obstruction) in patients who received rucaparib in the Treatment 
Part of the ARIEL4 study (12 of 232 patients [5.2%]; Table 1) was similar to the incidence observed in 
the pooled population of patients with ovarian cancer from Study CO-338-010, Study CO-338-017 
(ARIEL2), and Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3) (52 of 937 patients [5.5%]; Table 2). The incidence of events 
of intestinal obstruction assessed as treatment-related was also similar in patients who received rucaparib 
in the Treatment Part of ARIEL4 (1 of 232 patients [0.4%]) and in the pooled population (1 of 937 
patients [0.1%]). 
In addition, a comparison of the rucaparib and placebo treatment groups in ARIEL3 showed a similar 
incidence of events of intestinal obstruction between groups (rucaparib: 12 of 372 patients [3.2%]; 
placebo: 6 of 189 patients [3.2%]) (Table 2). This suggests that intestinal obstruction is not a treatment-
related event. 
In ARIEL4, 14 events of intestinal obstruction were reported in 12 patients receiving rucaparib during the 
Treatment Part, of which only one event was considered related to rucaparib by the investigator. Six of 
the events were considered to be serious, and eight events were nonserious. Of the 14 events, 12 events 
resolved, one event was resolving, and the one remaining event was ongoing at the time of the data cut 
on 30 September 2020. No fatal cases of intestinal obstruction were reported. In the majority of cases 
(11 of 12 patients [91.7%]), patients received treatment with concomitant medication, supportive 
therapy or procedural intervention. Treatment with rucaparib was interrupted following five events and 
withdrawn permanently after three events. For one event, dosing with rucaparib was maintained, and 
action taken with rucaparib was not applicable for four events, as treatment had already stopped. 
Time to onset of the events was variable from 7 to 499 days (mean = 132.1 days; median = 83.0 days). 
Prior abdominal surgery was noted in all 12 patients, primarily hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and 
omentectomy (related to the underlying disease of ovarian cancer). Overall, 5 patients experienced 
disease progression prior to or around the time of the event of intestinal obstruction. Three patients 
experienced disease progression after the onset of intestinal obstruction (22, 96, and 433 days after 
onset). No relevant tumor response data were available for 3 patients (as patients were withdrawn from 
the study prior to the first  Investigator Objective Tumor Assessment), and one patient had stable 
disease. 
In addition, 7 patients who had originally received chemotherapy in ARIEL4 and had crossed over to 
treatment with rucaparib (ie, Crossover Part of the study) experienced an event of intestinal obstruction 
(Table 1). Nine events were reported, none of which were considered to be related to rucaparib by the 
investigator. Four events were considered to be serious, and five were nonserious. All events resolved 
with or without sequelae. All patients received treatment with concomitant medication or procedural 
intervention. Treatment with rucaparib was interrupted following four events and was permanently 
withdrawn after one event. Dosing with rucaparib was maintained after one event, and action taken with 
rucaparib was not applicable for the remaining three events. 
Time to onset of intestinal obstruction varied between 6 and 294 days (mean = 76.4 days; median = 
29.0 days). Prior abdominal surgery indicative of underlying ovarian cancer was noted in all patients. Four 
patients experienced disease progression prior to the onset of the intestinal obstruction. Three patients 
experienced disease progression after the onset of the event (95, 163 and 200 days after onset). 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 140/234 
 
 
 
 
In the Treatment Part of ARIEL4, one patient (0.9%) experienced an event of intestinal obstruction 
following treatment with chemotherapy compared with the 12 patients (5.2%) who received rucaparib. 
However, the mean duration of treatment for patients receiving rucaparib was more than double that for 
patients receiving chemotherapy during the Treatment Part of the study (9.0 months vs. 4.4 months, 
respectively). As intestinal obstruction is most frequently associated with disease progression, the longer 
treatment duration in the rucaparib group may explain the disparity in the incidence of events, as more 
patients will have experienced worsening of their underlying disease while receiving extended daily 
therapy. In addition, patients who received platinum monotherapy or doublet therapy within the 
chemotherapy treatment group could only receive a maximum of 8 cycles (per protocol), meaning that 
treatment may have been completed before disease progression, and the possible associated risk of 
intestinal obstruction, was observed. 
Pooled Population (Study CO-338-010, ARIEL2, and ARIEL3) Intestinal Obstruction Events 
In the pooled population of patients with ovarian cancer, a total of 78 events were reported in 52 
patients, of which only one event was considered to be related to administration of rucaparib by the 
investigator. Fifty-six of the events were considered to be serious, and 22 were nonserious. Of the 78 
events of intestinal obstruction, 64 events (82.1%) resolved, seven events (9.0%) resolved with 
sequelae, six events were ongoing (7.7%), and one event was fatal. With the exception of 1 patient, all 
were treated with concomitant medication or procedural intervention or were hospitalized. Treatment with 
rucaparib was interrupted for 30 events (38.5%) and discontinued for 17 events (21.8%). Treatment with 
rucaparib was maintained for 13 events (16.7%), and action taken with rucaparib was not applicable for 
18 events (23.1%) as dosing had already stopped. 
Time to onset of the first event of intestinal obstruction was variable in the pooled population (3 to 983 
days; mean, 143.3 days; median, 99.0 days). Prior abdominal surgery was recorded for all 52 patients, 
reflecting the underlying disease of ovarian cancer. Overall, 17 patients (32.7%) experienced disease 
progression prior to or around the same time as the event. Fifteen patients (28.8%) experienced disease 
progression after the onset of intestinal obstruction. Ten patients (19.2%) did not experience disease 
progression (ie, had a complete or partial response or stable disease), and 10 patients (19.2%) had 
tumor data that was either unevaluable or not available. 
In conclusion, global prevalence of malignant bowel obstruction is estimated at 3% to 15% of cancer 
patients. Intestinal obstruction is even more common in ovarian cancer patients, with rates between 20% 
and 50% reported in the literature and these rates may be understimated due to difficulties in collection 
data from patients with late-stage disease when intestinal obstruction associated with disease progression 
may occur. Disease progression is a strong link to intestinal obstruction with cancer recurrence 
responsible for approximately 60% of intestinal obstruction cases in ovarian cancer patients. In addition, 
prior surgery is attributed as the cause of intestinal obstruction in a substantial proportion of cases, with 
estimates varying from 12% to 71% of cases. 
Overall, 71 of 1,169 patients (6.1%) experienced a total of 101 events of intestinal obstruction following 
treatment with rucaparib in ARIEL4 (including crossover patients), Study CO-338-010, ARIEL2, and 
ARIEL3. Only 2 of 101 events (2.0%) were considered related to administration of rucaparib by the 
investigator. All but one of the patients had undergone prior abdominal surgery (70 of 71 patients 
[98.6%]), which is strongly associated with the subsequent occurrence of intestinal obstruction. In 
addition, of the patients with available tumor data regarding disease progression, intestinal obstruction 
was noted for 26 of 49 patients (53.1%) prior to or around the same time as disease progression. Again, 
this shows a clear link to progression of the underlying disease rather than a treatment-related event, as 
observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 141/234 
 
 
 
 
A comparison of the rucaparib and placebo treatment groups in ARIEL3 shows a similar incidence of 
events of intestinal obstruction between groups (rucaparib: 12 of 372 patients [3.2%]; placebo: 6 of 189 
patients [3.2%]). This suggests again that intestinal obstruction is not a treatment-related event. 
Review of the data from the ARIEL4 study and the pooled ovarian cancer population indicates that the 
occurrence of intestinal obstruction appears to be primarily related to the underlying disease rather than 
to administration of rucaparib. This conclusion is in line with the review of events of intestinal obstruction 
performed at the request of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) and presented in 
the rucaparib Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 2 (covering 20 September 2018 to 19 June 2019). 
The PRAC Rapporteur concluded: “It is agreed that there remains insufficient evidence to consider 
intestinal obstruction as an identified or potential risk for patients receiving rucaparib. The MAH should 
continue to monitor this topic through routine pharmacovigilance.” 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
According to the MAH the events of intestinal obstruction reported in patients treated with rucaparib 
appear to be primarily related to the underlying disease rather than rucaparib treatment. The majority of 
events were not considered related to rucaparib by the investigator. In addition, the MAH stated that no 
differences were observed between treatment arms in the ARIEL3 study (3.2% rucaparib vs. 3.2% 
placebo), suggesting that these events were not related to study treatment. 
Regarding study ARIEL4, the MAH argues that differences observed between treatment arms may be due 
to the longer treatment exposure in the rucaparib arm. Even if MAH’s justification can be acknowledged, 
in order to further rule out a causal relationship with rucaparib, the MAH is requested to provide safety 
data of intestinal obstruction adjusted by treatment exposure. In addition, the narratives of all patients 
that reported an event of intestinal obstruction in the study ARIEL4 should also be submitted.  
Conclusion 
Issue not solved. 
Question 14 
The incidence of MDS/AML has been established based on a total of 2,972 patients treated with rucaparib 
in clinical trials. The MAH should specify to which studies (including a brief description) these patients 
come from.   
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Table 14 presents the numbers of patients exposed to oral rucaparib in each Clovis-sponsored clinical trial 
to five a total of 2.972 patients. The numbers of patients experiencing an event of myelodysplastic 
syndromes/ acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) are also presented by study.

be presented at the time of when the addendum to the CSR with OS and PFS2 final analyses would be 
submitted.  
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 15 
According to the MAH, the percentage of patients with QTcB and QTcF values ≥450 msec was typically 
<20% and QTcB and QTcF ≥481 msec or ≥501 msec occurred in few patients in the rucaparib and 
chemotherapy groups across time points. In order to have a better comparison, a table summarising all 
events of QTcF and QTcB values ≥450 msec, QTcB values ≥481 msec and QTcB values ≥501 msec 
reported during the study in both the rucaparib and chemotherapy arms should be provided.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Table 15 y table 16, respectively, summarize the numbers of patients in which longest QT interval 
corrected using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) and QT interval corrected using Bazett’s method (QTcB) values 
of ≥ 450 msec, ≥ 481 msec and ≥501 msec were reported during the treatment part of the study as 
compared to baseline values in both the rucaparib and chemotherapy arms. The longest change from 
baseline values >30 and >60 msec is also provided. 
There was no study entry exclusion criterion for QT interval. With regard to QTcF, 9 (3.9%) patients in 
the rucaparib arm and 5 (4.4%) patients in the chemotherapy arm had baseline values of 450 msec or 
greater. For QTcB, 24 (10.3%) patients in the rucaparib arm and 14 (12.4%) patients in the 
chemotherapy arm had baseline values of 450 msec or greater. 
The frequency of QTc values 481 msec, ≥501 msec, and change from baseline of >60 msec) are 
comparable across treatment arms. In the categories of ≥450 msec and change from baseline of >30 
msec, there is a trend to a numerically higher frequency in the rucaparib -treated patients. 
In terms of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), no cardiac or other clinical events indicative of, 
or potentially related to, QT prolongation disorders have been reported. One patient in the rucaparib arm, 
with known cardiac risk factors, had a fatal event of cardiac disorder considered unrelated to study drug 
(see response to question 17). CTCAE Grade 1/2 Electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported in 5 
(2.2%) and 6 (5.3%) patients in the rucaparib and chemotherapy treatment arms, of which 4 (1.7%) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022

6 (5.3%) respectively were considered related to study treatment. Given the very low incidence of TEAEs, 
the trend to a numerically higher frequency of QTc values between 450 to 480 msec and change from 
baseline of >30 msec, are not considered clinically significant.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The information requested has been provided. The number of patients with QTc values ≥481 msec or 
≥501 msec, and change from baseline of >60 msec were comparable between treatment arms. However, 
there was a higher number of patients with a QTc value ≥450 msec and change from baseline of >30 
msec in the rucaparib arm. Nevertheless, an increase in TEAEs has not been observed. 
Conclusion  
Issue solved. 
Question 16 
Safety data by age, race, BRCA mutated gene and BRCA mutation status (germline and somatic) have 
been provided. For a proper assessment the MAH is requested to provide comparative data (in the same 
table) for all these subgroups. The same data currently provided are requested.   
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Age 
Summaries of the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, 
and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), by system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT), are presented in Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19, respectively, for patients in the rucaparib 
and chemotherapy treatment groups by age subgroups of patients <65 years old, 65 to 74 years old, and 
≥75 years old in the Treatment Part, Safety Population. 
There were no notable differences in the incidence of TEAEs (Table 17), Grade 3 or higher TEAEs (Table 
18) or TESAEs (Table 19) between patients <65 years old, 65 to 74 years old, or ≥75 years old in either 
rucaparib or chemotherapy treatment groups. Some numerical differences were observed between 
rucaparib and chemotherapy treatment groups across the 3 age subgroups; however, the relatively small 
number of patients 65 to 74 years old and too few patients ≥75 years old in either treatment group 
considerably limited the interpretation of results in comparison with other age subgroups and overall 
patients. 
Events in the age subgroups <65 years old, 65 to 74 years old, or ≥75 years old subgroups appeared 
consistent with the overall safety population summarized in Section 12 of the Study CO-338-043 CSR, 
and primarily consisted of myelosuppression, asthenia/fatigue, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased, nausea, and vomiting in both treatment groups. Alopecia was also 
commonly observed in patients in the chemotherapy group across age subgroups.

Race 
For the Treatment Part, Safety Population, the majority of patients were White in both the rucaparib 
group (94.0% of patients, 218/232) and chemotherapy group (97.3% of patients, 110/113). Thus, the 
incidence of TEAEs for the White race subgroup was similar to overall Treatment Part, Safety Population, 
limiting the interpretation of race subgroup data. 
Summaries of the incidence of TEAEs, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, and TESAEs, by SOC and PT, are 
presented in Table 20, Table 21, and Table 22, respectively, for patients in the rucaparib and 
chemotherapy treatment groups by White, Other, and Unknown race subgroups in the Treatment Part,

BRCA Mutated Gene 
The majority of patients in the rucaparib group had a BRCA1 gene mutation (78.0% of patients, 181/232) 
as compared to a BRCA2 gene mutation (22.0% of patients, 51/232). Similarly, the majority of patients 
in the chemotherapy group had a BRCA1 gene mutation (67.9% of patients, 76/112) as compared to a 
BRCA2 gene mutation (32.1% of patients, 36/112). 
Some numerical differences were observed in comparison of incidence of TEAEs (Table 23), Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs (Table 24), or SAEs (Table 25) between patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in 
rucaparib or chemotherapy groups; however, the small size of the BRCA2 gene mutation subgroup made 
it difficult to interpret differences observed between the BRCA2 and BRCA1 gene mutation subgroups. 
Events in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation subgroups appeared consistent with the overall safety 
population, primarily consisting of myelosuppression, asthenia/fatigue, ALT/AST increased, nausea, and 
vomiting in both treatment groups. Alopecia was also commonly observed in patients in the 
chemotherapy group in BRCA1 and BRCA2 subgroups.

BRCA Mutation Status 
In the rucaparib group, 84.9% of patients (197/232) had a germline BRCA mutation and 15.1% of 
patients (35/232) had a somatic BRCA mutation. In the chemotherapy group, 82.9% of patients (92/111) 
had a germline BRCA mutation and 17.1% of patients (19/111) had a somatic BRCA mutation. Overall,

the small number of patients in either treatment group with a somatic BRCA mutation limited the 
interpretability of comparisons by BRCA mutation status. 
Some numerical differences were observed in comparison of incidence of TEAEs (Table 26), Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs (Table 27), or SAEs (Table 28) between patients with a germline BRCA or somatic BRCA 
mutation in rucaparib or chemotherapy groups; however, the small size of the somatic BRCA mutation 
subgroup made it difficult to interpret differences observed between the somatic and germline BRCA 
mutation subgroups. 
As observed in other subgroup analyses, events in germline BRCA and somatic BRCA subgroups appeared 
consistent with the overall safety population, primarily consisting of myelosuppression, asthenia/fatigue, 
ALT/AST increased, nausea, and vomiting in both treatment groups. Alopecia was also commonly 
observed in patients in the chemotherapy group in germline BRCA and somatic BRCA subgroups.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided the requested tabular summaries of common AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs and SAEs by 
age, race, BRCA mutated gene and BRCA mutation status. In relation to age, apparent higher AEs 
incidences were observed for the 65-74 years subgroup, which is somehow expected, although these 
higher rates of AEs are not evenly reported for all SOC and PTs. In addition, the number of patients 
included in the older subgroups (65-74 and ≥75) is lower than the <65 years group so any difference in 
the number of patients who reported a PT in this smaller subgroup would have a remarkable impact on 
the observed AEs incidences. Regarding race, as most subjects were white (95%), it is imposible to 
identify a trend in the other subgroups (other and unknown) toxicities. For BRCA mutated gene (BRCA 1 
vs. BRCA2) and BRCA mutation status (germline vs. somatic), once again we have unbalanced subgroups 
considering the number of subjects in each one of them. Higher incidences of AEs, by SOC, appear to be 
associated to BRCA2 mutated gene, in comparison with BRCA1 but no differences were identified between 
germline and somatic BRCA mutations. Overall, some differences in the reported AE rates were found but 
the subgroups sample size and the lack of stratification prevent any definitive conclusion about them. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 17 
Comparative data by platinum status of most frequent SAEs, deaths and TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
and dose reduction/interruption should be provided.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from Study CO-338-043 are summarized by platinum status 
at study entry and treatment group in the following tables for the Treatment Part of the study. 
Table 29 provides the incidence of TEAEs with an outcome of death by platinum-status subgroup. Many 
TEAEs with an outcome of death were single incidences, not appearing to be associated with treatment or 
platinum-status. Three TEAEs with an outcome of death (ie, Cardiac disorder, Death Not Otherwise 
Specified [NOS], and Myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS]) were assessed as treatment-related by the 
investigator; however, the events of Cardiac disorder and Death NOS were assessed by the Sponsor as 
unlikely related to rucaparib. Narratives of TEAEs with an outcome of death have been provided. 
Malignant neoplasm progression was the most common TEAE with an outcome of death, which was 
reported in patients who were platinum-resistant in either treatment group or partially platinum-sensitive 
in the rucaparib group. These cases were likely the result of the natural course of underlying disease and 
unrelated to study drug. No TEAEs with an outcome of death were reported for patients in the platinum-
sensitive subgroup. 
All events of disease progression with a fatal outcome within the safety reporting period were recorded as 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), since the study had been fully enrolled (ie, by 24 
September 2020) and the visit cut-off had occurred (ie, on 30 September 2020) prior to the 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 23 October 2020) in which events of disease 
progression were no longer collected as TEAEs.

Table 30 summarizes the incidence of TESAEs by platinum-status subgroup. There were no notable 
differences in the incidence of TESAEs in patients treated with rucaparib or chemotherapy across the 
platinum-resistant, partially platinum-sensitive, and platinum-sensitive subgroups. Anemia/hemoglobin 
decreased was the most common TESAE in patients treated with rucaparib; the incidence of 
anemia/hemoglobin decreased in the rucaparib arm was comparable across the 3 platinum-status 
subgroups. 
A higher incidence of SAEs was reported in patients who received rucaparib as compared to 
chemotherapy in any platinum-status subgroup, likely the result of longer time on treatment with 
rucaparib. The incidence of TESAEs was comparable between rucaparib and chemotherapy groups when 
adjusted for time on treatment.

Table 31 summarizes the incidence of TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation by platinum-status 
subgroup. The incidence of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug was generally low. There were 
no notable differences in the incidence of TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation in patients treated 
with rucaparib or chemotherapy across the platinum-status subgroups or treatment groups.

Table 32 summarizes the incidence of TEAEs that led to study drug interruption or dose reduction by 
platinum-status subgroup. Events of myelosuppression, including anemia/hemoglobin decreased, 
thrombocytopenia/decreased platelets, and neutropenia/decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were 
more common in rucaparib or chemotherapy groups across the platinum-status subgroups; however, 
there were no notable differences across platinum-status subgroups in either treatment group. It seemed 
that dose reductions or study drug interruptions appeared to contribute to the managemente of these 
TEAEs across all platinum-status subgroups regardless of treatment.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH was requested to provide comparative safety data by platinum status to better assess the safety 
profile of rucaparib in a similar patient population to the one covered by the CMA. When comparing the 
platinum-sensitive and partially platinum-sensitive population versus the platinum resistant subjects, no 
relevant imbalances have been identified  for deaths, SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation or dose 
modifications. The safety profile of rucaparib in a similar population than the one covered by the 
therapeutic indication approved by the CMA seem comparable to the overall population included in this 
study. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
13.  2nd Request for supplementary information  
Major objections  
1.  The MAH is requested to justify a positive benefit/risk balance in the approved indication in patients 
with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, based on data from the ARIEL 4 study. To this end, the 
following should be provided:  
a)  To help contextualising the worrisome OS findings resulting from the OS IA in study ARIEL 4, the 
MAH is asked to discuss available evidence for the impact on OS of the platinum chemotherapy in 
the control arm, compared to no treatment.  
b)  It is noted that ARIEL 3 study in the maintenance setting is ongoing with a due submission date 
of the CSR of December 2022. An OS snapshot at full maturity (70% of events) is already 
expected in May 2022. The MAH is requested to submit those top-line results as soon as available 
and work actively to deliver a report containing (final) OS results. Any information/report 
submitted is expected to include OS results for both the ITT population as well as restricted to 
BRCA mutated patients.  
Other concerns 
Clinical efficacy 
2.  In view of the reported OS results in study ARIEL 4 the MAH is asked to discuss: 
a) whether these results have been communicated to other regulatory agencies or in any other forum 
b) whether consideration has already been given to the need to inform healthcare professionals about 
these worrisome findings, both in relation to the initiation of new treatments, management of  
patients currently treated with rucaparib and potentially also ongoing clinical trials. In this context, 
the MAH should submit what they would consider an appropriate communication to HCPs in the 
format of a DHPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022

3.  To clarify the weight of possible imbalances in the baseline demographics and disease characteristics 
in the (unexpected) reported OS results, the MAH is requested to provide tabular summaries of these 
baseline demographics and disease characteristics at the time of randomization for three different 
subgroups of patients: patients randomized to rucaparib, patients randomized to chemotherapy who 
crossed over to rucaparib after progression and patients from the chemotherapy arm who did not 
cross over. Data for these 3 subgroups should be included in the same tables for a better comparison. 
4.  The MAH is requested to provide further information on patients who crossed-over to the rucaparib 
arm. In this regard, information on who did cross over (and who did not) among patients with disease 
progression and for which reasons should be submitted. 
5.  Regarding the supportive analyses adjusting for cross-over, the MAH is referred again to the EMA 
guidance “Question and answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology trials 
(EMA/845963/2018)” and should provide the analysis censoring the data at crossover (method 1 of 
the guideline) and at least one or two of the proposed methods for handling crossover. 
6.  The MAH is requested to submit the final analysis for OS and updated PFS2 results when available 
(REC already proposed). This report should include OS results by platinum sensitivity randomization 
status. In addition, potential cases of secondary MDS/AML are expected to be presented at the time 
of this final analysis. 
Clinical safety 
7.  Regarding study ARIEL4, the MAH is requested to provide: i) safety data of intestinal obstruction 
adjusted by treatment exposure; ii) the narratives of all patients that reported an event of intestinal 
obstruction during the study.

supplementary information 
14.1.  Major objections 
Question 1 
The MAH is requested to justify a positive benefit/risk balance in the approved indication in patients with 
platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer, based on data from the ARIEL 4 study. To this end, the following should be 
provided:  
a)  To help contextualising the worrisome OS findings resulting from the OS IA in study ARIEL-4, the 
MAH is asked to discuss available evidence for the impact on OS of the platinum chemotherapy in the 
control arm, compared to no treatment.  
b)  It is noted that ARIEL-3 study in the maintenance setting is ongoing with a due submission date of 
the CSR of December 2022. An OS snapshot at full maturity (70% of events) is already expected in 
May 2022. The MAH is requested to submit those top-line results as soon as available and work 
actively to deliver a report containing (final) OS results. Any information/report submitted is expected 
to include OS results for both the ITT population as well as restricted to BRCA mutated patients.  
Summary of the MAH’s response to question 1a) 
ARIEL4 evaluated the efficacy and safety of rucaparib versus active, standard-of-care chemotherapy 
comparators in a very heterogenous ovarian cancer patient population. Patients received ≥ 2 prior lines of 
chemotherapy had fully platinum-sensitive (FPS), partially platinum-sensitive (PPS), or platinum-resistant 
disease, and had evidence of a BRCA mutation. Of the patients randomized, 51% had platinum-resistant 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 181/234 
 
 
 
 
disease and 28% had PPS disease; these patients were randomized to receive rucaparib or paclitaxel 
monotherapy. The remaining 21% of patients had FPS disease and were randomized to receive either 
rucaparib or investigator-selected platinum monotherapy or platinum doublet, combined with paclitaxel or 
with gemcitabine. 
In support of this response, the MAH is now presenting the top-line final overall survival (OS) and second 
event of progression-free survival (PFS2) analyses using a data cut-off of 10 April 2022 as shown in Table 
1 for the intent-to-treat (ITT) and Efficacy Populations, and also for the platinum-status subgroups. The 
Kaplan-Meier curves for the Efficacy Population, ITT Population, and the platinum subgroups are 
presented in Figure 1 to Figure 12 below. 
At the time of the final OS analysis, 70% (244/349) of death events had occurred in the ITT Population. 
The platinum-resistant subgroup was more mature (77.6% [139/179]) than the platinum-sensitive 
subgroup, which had 61.8% (105/170) OS events and was comprised of the PPS (69.8% [67/96]) and 
the FPS subgroups (51.4% [38/74]). 
The hazard ratio (HR) for OS between rucaparib and chemotherapy patients in the ITT Population of 
ARIEL4 was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.73; p = 0.0507) (Table 1). This analysis was 
heavily confounded by crossover to rucaparib of patients who were initially randomized to be treated with 
chemotherapy (69% [80/116] patients) and also by the different outcomes in the platinum subgroups. 
Outcomes in the Fully Platinum-sensitive Subgroup 
At the time of the final OS analysis (cut-off date of 10 April 2022), 51% of death events had occurred in 
the FPS subgroup. The median OS in the rucaparib arm was 36.3 months versus 47.2 months for the 
comparator arm (HR 1.24 [95% CI, 0.62-2.50]) (Table 1). The Kaplan-Meier curves are superimposed 
until the 25-30 month timepoint (Figure 5). At this time, when the curves separated, only 11 patients in 
the chemotherapy arm remained at risk. 
Of these 11 patients, 8 patients (73%) were treated with rucaparib in the Crossover Part; therefore, the 
data at later timepoints could change and should be interpreted with caution. In the rucaparib arm, 13% 
of patients (6/48) were still receiving rucaparib treatment. In the comparator arm, 54% of patients 
(14/26) had progressed and crossed over to receive rucaparib. Table 2 summarizes OS outcomes from 
Phase 3 randomized clinical trials evaluating platinum-containing regimens in patients with platinum-
sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer. The reported median OS ranges from 17.3 to 33 months. It should be 
noted that the trials with the longest reported median OS enrolled a majority of second-line patients, 
whereas ARIEL4 included only patients in third or later-line treatment. 
Outcomes in the Partially Platinum-sensitive Subgroup 
At the time of the final OS analysis, 70% of death events had occurred in the PPS subgroup. 
The median OS in the rucaparib arm was 21.1 months and 23.2 months for the comparator arm (HR 0.97 
[95% CI, 0.58-1.62]) (Table 1). In the rucaparib arm, 6.2% (4/65) were still receiving rucaparib 
treatment. In the comparator arm, 81% (25/31) had progressed and crossed over to receive rucaparib. 
Discussion of Outcomes in Platinum-sensitive Subgroups of ARIEL4 
At the time of the final OS analysis, the platinum-sensitive subgroups (FPS and PPS combined), 62% of 
death events had occurred. In the platinum-sensitive population (FPS and PPS), there was no significant 
difference in OS between patients randomized to the rucaparib versus chemotherapy arm. The median OS 
was 29.4 months in the rucaparib arm vs 27.6 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.07 [95% CI, 0.71-
1.62]; p = 0.7455) (Table 1). 
The MAH claims that this result is also consistent with the results from the randomized Phase 3 trial 
SOLO3, which compared the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib with chemotherapy in patients with platinum-
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 182/234 
 
 
 
 
sensitive disease, but which did not include a platinum comparator (HR 1.07 [95% CI, 0.76-1.49]). In the 
SOLO3 trial, a high proportion of patients randomized to comparator also received PARPi as a subsequent 
line of therapy. The median OS in patients randomized to rucaparib within the platinum-sensitive 
subgroups of ARIEL4 was also consistent with reported median OS in Phase 3 trials that evaluated 
platinum-based or paclitaxel treatment in the recurrent setting (Table 2). 
Discussion of Outcomes in Platinum-resistant Subgroup of ARIEL4 
The difference in OS is driven by the result in platinum-resistant patients, the subgroup whose population 
is not within the current approved treatment indication for Rubraca. 
Although the median OS estimates in the platinum-resistant subgroup are longer in patients randomized 
to weekly paclitaxel versus rucaparib (22.2 vs 14.2 months), the OS in platinum-resistant patients 
receiving paclitaxel in ARIEL4 is considerably longer than outcomes reported for paclitaxel in trials of 
women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer (13.2 to 15.5 months), while the outcomes in the patients 
randomized to rucaparib are within the range expected with standard-of-care in this setting.

PFS2 is the time from randomization until progression on the line of therapy after the first trial therapy. It 
is accepted as a valid measure of long-term benefit in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. 
At the time of final analysis, the PFS2 data were 80.6 % (262/325) and 81.9% (286/349) mature in the 
Efficacy and ITT Populations, respectively. Similar to the interim PFS2 results, there was no significant 
difference between rucaparib treatment and chemotherapy treatment for PFS2 in either the Efficacy 
Population or ITT Population in the final analysis.

Conclusion  
ARIEL4 included a broad spectrum of ovarian cancer patients with platinum sensitive or platinum resistant 
disease. Within the platinum sensitive group, those with PPS disease were randomized to rucaparib or 
paclitaxel, and those with FPS disease were randomized to rucaparib or a platinum regimen. 
Although the HR has improved in the final OS analysis from the interim analysis, in the overall trial 
population, the HR continues to favor the group originally randomized to chemotherapy with many also 
crossing over to receive rucaparib. However, the results between the platinum subgroups differ markedly. 
When considering the EMA approved indication, this is important, because the approved indication only 
applies to patients with platinum-sensitive disease who can no longer tolerate further platinum. 
In the analysis of all platinum-sensitive patients in ARIEL4, PFS2 favors rucaparib, and the median OS is 
longer for rucaparib as compared to chemotherapy (29.4 months vs 27.6 months; HR 1.07 [95% CI, 
0.71-1.62]; p = 0.746). These results are strikingly similar to those reported for another PARPi in the 
SOLO3 randomized Phase 3 trial which evaluated olaparib vs chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive patients 
harboring a BRCA mutation but which did not include platinum as a comparator (HR 1.07 [95% CI, 0.76-
1.49]; p = 0.714). 
As in ARIEL4, the primary endpoint in SOLO3 was PFS. Taken together, the results from ARIEL4 and 
SOLO3 suggest a beneficial effect of PARPi treatment with no decrement in OS in the overall platinum-
sensitive population. 
As part of the CMA approval, the CHMP agreed (as per Rapporteurs Day 180 Joint [4th RSI] CHMP and 
PRAC Response Assessment Report) that within ARIEL4, the PPS subgroup is directly relevant to the 
approved indication. In this subgroup, the comparator chemotherapy was non-platinum (ie, weekly 
paclitaxel), representing an active standard of care that is routinely used in platinum-sensitive patients 
who are unable to tolerate further chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 191/234 
 
 
 
 
 
Importantly, in that PPS subgroup, without making any adjustments for the confounding effects of the 
high rate of crossover, all efficacy endpoints (including the primary endpoint of PFS, the longer-term 
benefit endpoint of PFS2, and the OS endpoint) support a positive benefit:risk of rucaparib for 
monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA-mutated 
(germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, 
who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable 
to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
This response provides a summary of the top-line final OS dataset. Further analyses are ongoing. These 
include additional statistical modeling using EMA-recommended methodology to account for the effects of 
crossover, and a detailed analysis of treatments received after rucaparib, to understand the potential 
effects of treatment sequencing when PARPi are integrated into the ovarian cancer treatment paradigm. 
Summary of the MAH’s response to question 1b) 
The ARIEL3 OS data have reached sufficient maturity and the MAH is therefore providing the topline OS 
results in response to this question. 
Topline analyses using a data cut-off of 04 April 2022 showed no difference in OS between rucaparib and 
placebo in the intent-to-treat (ITT) Population (72.7% maturity; HR 0.995, 95% CI, 0.809-1.223, p = 
0.9621) or the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) Population (68.9% maturity; HR 1.005, 95% 
CI, 0.766-1.320, p = 0.9693) (Table 3). A non-statistically significant trend towards improvement was 
observed in the tBRCA Population (66.3% maturity: HR 0.832, 95% CI, 0.581-1.192, p = 0.3162) (Table 
3). Kaplan-Meier analyses of OS between rucaparib and placebo patients are presented for the tBRCA 
Population in Figure 13, for the HRD Population in Figure 14 and in the ITT Population in Figure 15. 
A confounding factor with respect to the above results is that the patients who are still alive have been 
treated with multiple subsequent regimens of anticancer treatment following the randomized treatment 
received in ARIEL3. A summary of the overall number of lines of subsequent anticancer treatments and 
the time from randomization to start of subsequent line of anticancer treatment for the analysis 
populations are presented in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. The median number of subsequent 
treatment regimens was 3 (range 1-10). Overall, of the patients in the ITT Population who went on to 
receive subsequent treatment, 30% (138/461) received a PARP inhibitor (Table 4). 
In ARIEL3, 89% (168/189) of patients randomized to placebo received at least one subsequent anticancer 
regimen and out of the patients that received subsequent therapy, 46% of patients (77/168) received 
subsequent treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including 72% of patients (43/60) and 59% of patients 
(62/105) in the tBRCA and HRD populations, respectively (Table 6). The frequency of subsequent PARPi 
usage was higher than reported in trials of other PARP inhibitors, and likely resulted from the widespread 
availability of marketed PARPi at the time ARIEL3 participants were candidates for subsequent treatment 
lines. The majority of patients received a single subsequent treatment containing a PARP inhibitor, but 
5% (8/168) of patients in the ITT Population received 2 or 3 subsequent regimens containing a PARP 
inhibitor; this was more frequent in the tBRCA population (10% [6/60]) (Table 6). 
To understand the time that subsequent PARP inhibitor therapies were received, analyses were performed 
to evaluate the median time to first subsequent PARP inhibitor therapy relative to randomization date into 
placebo treatment on study, as well as the median duration of subsequent PARP inhibitor therapy given to 
these placebo patients. In the 77 patients randomized to placebo who received treatment with 
subsequent PARP inhibitors, the median time to first subsequent PARP inhibitor treatment was 
14.1months (95% CI, 11.6, 16.7) in the tBRCA Population, 15.8 months (95% CI 13.4, 20.8) in the HRD 
Population, and 16.8 months (95% CI, 14.1, 21.0) in the ITT Population (Table 7). 
The median duration of first PARPi usage was similar across the populations and ranged from 11.5 
months (95% CI, 8.6, 16.5) in the ITT Population to 13.8 months (95% CI, 8.6, 16.9) in the tBRCA 
Assessment report

Population (Table 8). The duration of PARPi usage is longer than the duration of placebo usage in the 
ARIEL3 trial (median duration of 5.5 months in the ITT Population) and suggests that the patients 
experienced beneficial effects of the PARPi when given in a subsequent line of therapy. 
In placebo patients in the ITT Population treated with subsequent lines of treatment, the subsequent 
PARPi therapy was primarily administered with the first (23.8% [40/168] of patients), second (21.6% 
[29/134] of patients), and third (16.5% [16/97] of patients) subsequent treatments, with more limited 
usage in the fourth (7.4% [5/68] of patients) and fifth (4.3% [2/46] of patients) subsequent treatments 
(Table 9). 
Conclusion 
The results provide additional confirmation of the positive benefit:risk of rucaparib in recurrent ovarian 
cancer even with the high proportion of patients in the ARIEL3 placebo arm who went on to receive a 
PARPi as a subsequent treatment with a beneficial outcome. An ARIEL3 CSR Addendum, which will include 
OS and updated safety will be provided to the EMA in 3Q2022.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
a. The final OS analysis from study ARIEL4 (DCO 10 April 2022) showed results consistent with the IA. In 
the ITT population a detrimental effect in OS is observed with rucaparib over chemotherapy, although 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 199/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with a lower HR (HR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.73). Similar results were observed in the efficacy population 
(HR 1.31; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.74). Study ARIEL4 included a heterogeneous patient population, i.e. not only 
platinum sensitive patients (i.e. fully platinum sensitive and partially platinum sensitive patients), but also 
platinum resistant patients, all of them BRCA mutated. Further, the comparator arm could be paclitaxel 
(for those resistant and partially platinum sensitive) or platinum therapy (for the subgroup of fully 
platinum sensitive patients). The MAH argues that the (detrimental) effect is driven by the results in 
platinum-resistant patients and the fact that results in patients receiving paclitaxel in the ARIEL4 study 
are longer than those reported in other trials in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The latter 
is however difficult to ascertain and may be due to differences in baseline characteristics of the patient 
population. Further, according to the summary of results from available trials in this treatment setting 
submitted by the MAH (see table 2 above that provides OS outcomes from phase 3 randomised clinical 
trials evaluating platinum-containing regimens in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian 
cancer), the impact of platinum based chemotherapy on OS is not really known / established. In addition, 
the argumentation by the MAH that the observed detrimental effect could be explained by crossover is 
not supported (see question 5). 
The MAH asserts that in the subgroup of partially-platinum sensitive (PPS) patients (n=96), which 
represents approximately 28% of the patient population both PFS (HR 0.41; 95% CI: 0.256, 0.659), 
primary endpoint, and PFS2 (HR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.41, 1.03) favoured the rucaparib arm, with no 
detrimental effect in OS (HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.62). With regards to the (post-hoc) ‘pooled’ subgroup 
of platinum-sensitive patients the MAH states that no significant differences were observed (HR 1.07; 
95% CI: 0.71, 1.62), but without a detriment in OS, showing therefore the beneficial effect. Further, the 
MAH also argues that these results are in line with those of the SOLO3 trial, a Phase 3 study of olaparib 
versus non-platinum chemotherapy in a similar patient population of platinum sensitive patients. 
It is acknowledged that the effect might partially be driven by the subgroup of platinum-resistant 
patients, which represents 51% of the patient population, where the reported detrimental effect appears 
clearer (HR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.17) and that in the context of the approved indication (i.e. platinum 
sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated patients who are unable to tolerate further platinum-
based chemotherapy), the subgroup of patients platinum sensitive (particularly those partially sensitive), 
represent the most relevant population to confirm the B/R balance of rucaparib in the treatment 
indication. However, and albeit the limitations to extract definitive conclusions from subgroups’ data, in 
the platinum sensitive populations, either pooled or separate, OS results are also not reassuring, 
particularly in fully platinum sensitive patients. Importantly, no specific discussion has been provided by 
the MAH for the results observed in platinum resistant patients. This is considered a limitation since in the 
absence of further justification why the detrimental effect on OS should be understood as related/linked 
(specifically) to platinum resistant disease it is difficult to disregard such findings when considering the 
results reported in other subgroups, as discussed above.  
b. The MAH has provided topline results of more mature OS analysis from the ARIEL3 study, a Phase 3, 
double-blind study of rucaparib versus placebo in patients with advanced platinum-sensitive high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer who had received 2 or more previous platinum-based chemotherapy and which was 
the basis for the approval or rucaparib in the ‘maintenance treatment’ indication 
(EMEA/H/C/004272/II/0001).  
At the DCO (04 April 2022), no statistically significant differences were observed in OS between rucaparib 
and placebo, neither in the ITT population (HR 0.995; 95% CI, 0.809-1.223; median OS 36 months 
rucaparib vs 43.2 placebo) nor in the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) population (HR 
1.005, 95% CI, 0.766-1.320). Data maturity was, respectively, of 72.7% and 68.9%. In the tBRCA 
population a trend in favour of rucaparib was observed, but statistically significance was not reached (HR 
0.832; 95% CI, 0.581-1.192). According to the MAH, these results may be affected by subsequent 
treatments received and in particular subsequent treatment with PARP inhibitors. Of note, in the ITT 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 200/234 
 
 
 
 
population the proportion of patients that received subsequent treatment was higher in the placebo arm 
compared with the rucaparib arm (88.9% vs 78.1%). Of these, 45.8% and 20.8%, respectively, received 
treatment with a PARPi, being olaparib the most commonly used in both treatment arms (28.6% vs. 
14.3%). 
These results do not indicate so far a negative impact on OS. Nevertheless a CSR Addendum of the study 
is expected to be provided in 3Q2022.  
Conclusion 
Having all considered, the positive B/R balance of rucaparib in the ‘treatment’ indication cannot be 
considered confirmed based on the results from the ARIEL4 study. Important uncertainties still remain 
regarding a potential detrimental effect on OS when rucaparib is used over chemotherapy in the specific 
patient population covered by the indication.  
In view of the reported results from the ARIEL4 study on 22 April 2022 the EC initiated a procedure under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and requested the CHMP to assess all the concerns and their 
impact on the B/R balance of rucaparib in the ‘treatment’ indication. 
On 9 June 2022 the MAH sent a notification to request the removal of the “treatment” indication (i.e. 
monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated 
(germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, 
who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable 
to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy”) from the product information. This (voluntary) request 
followed the MAH’s decision to no longer market Rubraca in the third line treatment indication as “most 
ovarian cancer patients that receive a PARP inhibitor do so earlier as a maintenance therapy after first or 
second-line chemotherapy”.  
As stated above, in view of the remaining unresolved uncertainties regarding the observed OS detriment 
in the ARIEL4 study, it is currently not possible to confirm the positive B/R of rucaparib in the third line 
treatment indication (see EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033).  
Considering the outcome of procedure EMEA/H/A-20/1518/C/4272/0033, this issue is not further 
pursued.  
14.2.  Other concerns 
Clinical efficacy 
Question 2 
In view of the reported OS results in study ARIEL-4 the MAH is asked to discuss: 
a) whether these results have been communicated to other regulatory agencies or in any other forum 
b) whether consideration has already been given to the need to inform healthcare professionals about 
these worrisome findings, both in relation to the initiation of new treatments, management of patients 
currently treated with rucaparib and potentially also ongoing clinical trials. In this context, the MAH 
should submit what they would consider an appropriate communication to HCPs in the format of a DHPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
a)  Interim OS data and associated datasets were included in the Global ARIEL4 Clinical Study Report 
(CSR) which was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (15 September 2021) and 
the EMA (current variation submitted on 27 August 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 201/234 
 
 
 
 
As previously stated, at the time of the CSR visit cut-off, overall survival (OS) data were at 51% 
maturity, with the final readout for OS planned per the SAP when 70% maturity has been reached. 
Thus, the interim analysis presented in the report was considered exploratory, with the final OS 
analysis to be submitted when final, in an addendum to the CSR. 
The benefit-risk was continuously monitored in the ARIEL4 trial by an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC), which reviewed safety and efficacy data, including OS data, for both treatment 
arms. The IDMC did not require any actions regarding study conduct; it recommended that the study 
continue following each meeting. Overall, rucaparib has been extensively investigated in clinical trials 
and has demonstrated a consistent profile of safety and efficacy across numerous studies. 
b)  As the EMA is aware, as a result of the Clarification Meeting held between EMA and Clovis on 01 April 
2022:  
A Cover Letter, an initial draft of a Communication Plan, and an initial draft of a Dear Healthcare 
Professional Communication (DHPC) were provided to the EMA on 06 April 2022. The communication 
plan and DHPC were subsequently agreed with the agency on 22 April 2022 and published by the EMA 
on 26 April 2022. In accordance with the agreed timetable, the DHCP has been translated, agreed 
upon, and distributed in line with the timelines and national requirements of each Member State. 
As per the draft Communication Plan provided to the EMA on 06 April 2022, a Dear Investigator Letter 
(DIL) was provided to investigators involved in the ARIEL4 study (and by extension, those 
investigators involved in the ARIEL2 study). This ARIEL4 DIL was sent to the EMA, via email as per 
request, on 21 April 2022. A communication has been sent to members of Independent Data 
Monitoring Committees (IDMC)/Data Monitoring Committees (DMC) for the ongoing clinical studies, 
where those committees are in place, informing them of the communications with the EMA and the 
agreed-upon EMA DHCP and FDA DHCP. Further communication with those studies’ investigators and 
other investigators for Clovis sponsored or non-sponsored studies where rucaparib is an 
investigational medicinal product (IMP), is ongoing to determine recommendations for those ongoing 
trials. In addition, Clovis is in the process of communicating the ARIEL4 OS dataset to all principal 
investigators of investigator initiated trials of rucaparib across all indications. 
On 06 April 2022, the US FDA informed Clovis that they have met with EMA regarding the interim OS 
data for ARIEL4 and requested a copy of the EU DHPC. On 08 April 2022, Clovis provided a copy of 
the documentation sent to EMA on 06-07 April 2022 (cover letter, draft communication plan, initial 
draft DHPC, and statement from the Co-lead investigators). Clovis has subsequently agreed with the 
FDA on the final content of a DHCP letter for the US on 11 May 2022. The US version of the DHCP is 
broadly similar to the EMA-agreed version with the exception that final OS data for the ARIEL4 trial is 
included. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In view of the reported results from the ARIEL4 study on 22 April 2022 the EC initiated a procedure under 
Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and requested the CHMP to assess all the concerns and their 
impact on the B/R balance of rucaparib in the ‘treatment’ indication. This procedure is still ongoing. 
Further, a DHPC was published on the EMA website on 06 May 2022.  
Of note, the indication of rucaparib ‘for the treatment of adult patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation 
(germline and/or somatic)-associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who 
have been treated with two or more chemotherapies’, which is different from the one approved in the EU, 
has been removed in the US.

Issue solved. 
Question 3 
To clarify the weight of possible imbalances in the baseline demographics and disease characteristics in 
the (unexpected) reported OS results, the MAH is requested to provide tabular summaries of these 
baseline demographics and disease characteristics at the time of randomization for three different 
subgroups of patients: patients randomized to rucaparib, patients randomized to chemotherapy who 
crossed over to rucaparib after progression and patients from the chemotherapy arm who did not cross 
over. Data for these 3 subgroups should be included in the same tables for a better comparison. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided tabular summaries of the baseline demographics (Table 1), disease characteristics 
(Table 2), and cancer history and prior anticancer treatment (Table 3) at the time of randomization based 
on the final OS data cut of 10 April 2022. Of the total of 349 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
Population, there were 233, 80, and 36 patients for the following 3 different subgroups of patients in the 
ITT Population: 
•  Group 1: patients randomized to rucaparib (N=233) 
•  Group 2: patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to rucaparib after disease 
progression (N=80) 
•  Group 3: patients from the chemotherapy arm who did not crossover (N=36) 
Apparently, the different subgroups were well balanced for baseline demographic characteristics, cancer 
history, prior anticancer treatment, and disease characteristics. There was a slight tendency for the 
crossover patients to have had a better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG 
PS) at baseline (ECOG PS of 0 in 67.5% of patients in Group 2 as compared to 53.6% and 50.0% of 
patients in Groups 1 and 3, respectively; Table 1). 
Patients in the chemotherapy arm who did not cross over (Group 3), surprisingly, may be less heavily 
pre-treated population (≥ 3 prior chemotherapy regimens: 33.3% in Group 3 as compared to 42.5% and 
45.0% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively) and more platinum-sensitive (progression-free interval [PFI] ≥ 12 
months: 33.3% in Group 3 as compared to 20.6.0% and 17.5% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively; Table 
3). 
According to the MAH, although the group of patients randomized to chemotherapy who did not cross 
over to receive rucaparib appeared to have worse OS outcomes than both the group randomized to 
rucaparib and the crossover group, there is no evidence to suggest that the non-crossover patients 
represented a group with a significantly worse prognosis at the start of the trial.

As requested, the MAH has provided demographics and baseline disease characteristics separately for 
patients randomized to rucaparib (n=233), patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to 
rucaparib upon disease progression (n=80) and those who did not cross over (n=36). The aim of this 
request was to check whether patient’s demographics or (baseline) disease characteristics would indicate 
that patients who crossed over had a better prognosis that could have led to a prolonged survival (even) 
when receiving chemotherapy as upfront treatment in this trial, and better than in patients originally 
randomized to rucaparib. Overall, no relevant differences have been identified between groups, at least, 
not to the extent that could justify the observed findings. The group of patients who did not cross over is 
small (n=36) and therefore interpretation is difficult. According to the MAH, ECOG PS was slightly better 
for patients who crossed over and they also seemed to be less heavily pretreated. This last reasoning is 
however not agreed as, although there were fewer patients who had 3 and 4 previous lines in the group 
of patients who did not cross over, there were also more patients who had received 5 previous lines in 
this group. 
The submitted data do not help justifying the observed differences in OS. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 4 
The MAH is requested to provide further information on patients who crossed-over to the rucaparib arm. 
In this regard, information on who did cross over (and who did not) among patients with disease 
progression and for which reasons should be submitted. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The ARIEL4 Protocol specified that patients could cross over from chemotherapy to rucaparib after it was 
confirmed that the criteria for radiologic disease progression were met either during treatment or at some 
point following discontinuation of chemotherapy. 
At the time the dataset was analysed for the primary endpoint of PFS, 80% of patients (93/116) in the 
chemotherapy arm had experienced disease progression. Of these, 80 patients crossed over and 13 
patients did not. Reasons that eligible patients did not cross over to rucaparib were not collected in the 
database. In addition, as chemotherapy was typically administered with a set maximum number of cycles 
(platinum-based chemotherapy was capped at 8 cycles per protocol and paclitaxel was per institutional 
guidelines), with progression events occurring at various timepoints during or beyond the safety follow-up 
phase of the trial, it is not possible to analyze safety, laboratory, or Quality-of-Life status at the time of 
progression uniformly. Therefore, in order to understand potential factors that may have influenced 
patient/investigator decision management after chemotherapy progression, subsequent treatments have 
been analysed in the group eligible for crossover who did not cross over. 
Of the 13 eligible patients who did not cross over, 2 withdrew consent, 4 had no subsequent therapy 
reported and died 3 to 6 months after progression, and 7 received subsequent treatment, including 
subsequent treatment with a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) in 3 of these 7 patients. The subsequent treatment 
for these 7 patients was as follows: 
• 
PLD 
•  Gemcitabine 
• 
Paclitaxel + cisplatin + bevacizumab 
•  Rucaparib – Doxorubicin + carboplatin (2 regimens) 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 210/234 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Avelumab – PLD (2 regimens) 
•  Carboplatin + paclitaxel + niraparib maintenance – Carboplatin + gemcitabine – Carboplatin + 
PLD (3 regimens) 
• 
Ipilimumab + nivolumab – Rucaparib – Paclitaxel (3 regimens) 
More than 50% of patients who progressed on chemotherapy but who did not cross over to rucaparib 
received subsequent treatment(s). Many of the patients who progressed but did not cross over to 
rucaparib went on to receive 1 or more chemotherapy-based regimens, suggesting that suboptimal 
activity of subsequent regimens, rather than patient-related factors contributed to the inferior OS in these 
patients as compared to eligible patients who crossed over. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The study protocol specified that patients could cross over from chemotherapy to rucaparib after 
radiologic disease progression was confirmed. At time of the primary PFS analysis, 80% (93/116) of 
patients in the chemotherapy arm had disease progression. Of these, 80 patients (86%) crossed over and 
13 (14%) did not. Therefore, the influence of bias due to 13 patients not switching at progression is 
limited. 
According to the MAH, the reasons why eligible patients did not cross over to rucaparib were not collected 
in the database so this question cannot be answered. Instead, the MAH has provided information about 
subsequent therapies for the 13 patients who did not cross over to rucaparib upon progression. Four 
patients did not receive subsequent therapy and died within 6 months. Two patients withdrew consent so 
no data are available for them. The remaining seven patients received various therapies that included not 
only standard chemotherapy regimens recommended in this setting but also anti PD-(L)1 monoclonal 
antibodies and PARP inhibitors, including rucaparib and also niraparib (given to one patient as 
maintenance following response to platinum-based chemotherapy). 
Half of the patients who were eligible to cross over to rucaparib but did not choose this option received 
subsequent therapy that impacted their survival after study treatment. The impact of results in these 
very few patients in the context of the reported results in the overall population randomized to 
chemotherapy is expected to be very low.  
Conclusion 
Issue considered resolved. 
Question 5 
Regarding the supportive analyses adjusting for cross-over, the MAH is referred again to the EMA 
guidance “Question and answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology trials 
(EMA/845963/2018)” and should provide the analysis censoring the data at crossover (method 1 of the 
guideline) and at least one or two of the proposed methods for handling crossover. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The ARIEL4 design allowed for patients randomized to chemotherapy to cross over upon radiologic 
disease progression to receive rucaparib as part of the clinical trial. Patients randomized to rucaparib did 
not have an option to cross over to chemotherapy within the trial and received their next line of 
treatment outside of the trial as standard of care. In total, 69% of the patients randomized to 
chemotherapy crossed over and received rucaparib. In total, 90% of patients enrolled in ARIEL4, 313 out

of 349, patients received treatment with rucaparib (233 patients initially randomized and 80 patients 
crossing over after completing chemotherapy) during the clinical trial. When interpreting the final OS 
results it is important to account for the crossover. 
The MAH has performed conventional adjustments described in method 1 of the guideline “Question and 
answer on adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology trials (EMA/845963/2018)” for 
crossover on the final OS dataset (visit cutoff 10 April 2022). In addition, the MAH has performed the 
more complex adjustment models (time-varying covariate adjustment and the Two-stage Estimation 
(TSE) model, which is one of the proposed methods in the guidance) for the final OS and are presenting 
them below. 
Conventional methods adjusting Final OS for crossover 
The first analysis excludes the patients who crossed over from chemotherapy to rucaparib. In the second 
analysis, the data are censored at crossover (method 1 of the guideline EMA/845963/2018). When 
excluding patients who crossover over, the OS is significantly improved in favour of those randomized to 
rucaparib. The analysis where the data was censored at crossover, showed no difference or determinant 
between the 2 randomized arms by this method.

As an initial proposal to adjust for crossover, the MAH used a Cox proportional hazards model with time-
dependent treatment effect covariate for adjusting for the effect of treatment crossover and to isolate the 
overall effect of rucaparib on OS. This analysis demonstrated no difference between the randomized 
treatment groups in OS when adjusting for starting rucaparib either at randomization or in crossover 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.912, [95% CI, 0.593-1.402]; p = 0.673). The MAH acknowledges that this 
method is more relevant to an observational study in which all patients received rucaparib, however, the 
majority (90%) of patients did receive rucaparib in this study. It is also acknowledged that, if additional 
time dependent covariates were available, it would be helpful to also include them in this modelling to 
help assess the robustness of the model. 
The MAH did review the methods in the guidelines (EMA/845963/2018) and believes that out of the 3 
models proposed, the Two-stage Estimation (TSE) model is the most appropriate for the ARIEL4 dataset.1 
The TSE model for the final OS is presented in this report. The reasons for lack of suitability of the other 2 
models (Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting [IPCW] and Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time 
[RPSFT]) are discussed below. 
Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting 
The IPCW is a method that employs 2 steps. The first step involves estimating the probability of a patient 
switching treatments. The second step incorporates the inverse of these predicted probabilities as 
weights, in a weighted Cox proportional hazards analysis. The MAH decided to not pursue the IPCW 
method due to not having any time-dependent (changing) covariates (eg, longitudinal analysis of 
circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA] or other marker). It is recommended in the literature to use what are 
called “stabilized” weights for this model. These weights require the use of both “baseline” covariates and 
time dependent (changing) covariates. The lack of time-dependent covariates in this study would mean 
that only unstabilized weights could be used and thus this method cannot be implemented as 
recommended. 
Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time 
The second method of RPSFT assumes what is referred to as the “common treatment effect,” which 
requires that control group patients who switch to the experimental treatment during the trial receive the 
same treatment effect compared to patients who were originally randomized to the experimental group. 
The authors state that the common treatment effect assumption can be problematic, because it would 
seem possible that after having received one treatment until progression, and then deciding to switch to 
the experimental treatment, the prognosis would not be the same as if they were originally randomized to 
the experimental treatment. Thus, this model requires that the treatment effect received by patients who 
decide to cross over to experimental treatment must be the same as that received by patients initially 
randomized to the experimental group”. In addition, the RPSFT counterfactual survival model assumes 
that patients are either ‘on’ treatment or ‘off’ treatment. In situations where the comparator treatment is 
active, rather than placebo, this is problematic as two treatment effects exist.3 Lastly, parameter 
estimation with the RPSFT model is difficult when the mean time on experimental therapy is similar 
between the 2 randomized arms, as it is in the ARIEL4 study. The mean duration of treatment was 
approximately 9 months for both the patients randomized to rucaparib and in the group of patients that 
crossed over to rucaparib. Due to these limitations, the MAH decided not to pursue this method in this 
response, either. 
Two-stage Estimation Model 
The last method in the guidance, the TSE method, is presented below. With this method, as described in 
the EMA/845963/2018, the first stage involves using only the control group patients to estimate the 
treatment effect received by patients who switched compared to patients who did not switch. Then, in the 
second stage, the treatment effect estimate is used as an “acceleration factor” for the patients who 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 214/234 
 
 
 
 
switched to obtain counterfactual event times in the absence of crossover. During the first stage, a 
“secondary baseline” is identified, and a parametric accelerated failure time model is fit to the post-
progression control group data to obtain the treatment effect estimate. In order to fully characterize the 
utility of this adjustment method a range of acceleration factors were estimated. Note that at the end of 
the first stage, the counterfactual times for subjects may be re-censored. However, Latimer et. Al. 
suggest that, while both re-censoring and not re-censoring may result in bias, a TSE without re-censoring 
performs adequately with minimal bias and what bias it has tends to be in favor of the control group; 
therefore, it is a more conservative approach. In light of this, no re-censoring was performed (meaning 
the original death/censoring variables are used for the counterfactual survival times in chemotherapy 
patients who crossed over). 
The first approach was to directly follow the description of the TSE method in Latimer et al. In the first 
stage of the analysis, only the post-progression control group data are used. These data are treated as an 
“observational study”, and thus we are only considering patients in the control group (regardless of 
crossover) who experienced disease progression at some time T0, which becomes the new “secondary 
baseline”. Then, a parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model using the Weibull distribution is fit to 
the post-progression data, with terms for (1) randomization stratification at baseline; (2) the time to 
disease progression from the randomization baseline; and (3) an indicator for treatment switching. 
The SAS procedure PROC LIFEREG estimates the coefficient associated with treatment switching as 
=0.9614 (95% CI, 0.5017-1.42). Note that PROC LIFEREG models the log-time, meaning that the 
 between patients who switched vs those who did not is as 
𝛽𝛽
difference in post-progression survival time 
follows: 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
To determine the counterfactual post-progression survival time 
 for patients who crossed over, we solve 
for  
: 
Which means the “aceleration factor” is e-0.9614 ≈0.382. This means that, had the crossover patients not 
switched to rucaparib, we expect their survival time after switching treatments would have been roughly 
38% of what was observed. Thus, the counterfactual OS time U (from the randomization baseline) for 
patients who crossed over at time Toff (“off” as in time spent “off rucaparib”; similarly, Ton represents the 
observed time “on” rucaparib after crossing over) is estimated as: 
Figure 3 shows a Kaplan-Meier plot of the counterfactual survival times of only the chemotherapy patients 
(crossover vs. non-crossover). The median OS in chemotherapy patients who cross over is now adjusted 
to 15.2 vs. 9.1 months in those who did not cross over. While the acceleration factor has resulted in 
bringing the estimates of the groups closer by reducing the survival time in the patients who crossover, 
the stratified log-rank test is still statistically significant (p = 0.0027) so the adjustment is conservative in 
that it does not completely bring the 2 groups together.

As a sensitivity analysis, the MAH explored the “tipping-points”, which were values of the acceleration 
factor e-β that would result in statistically significant differences in the HR, both (1) in favour of rucaparib 
(HR significantly < 1), and (2) in favour of chemotherapy (HR significantly > 1). Testing values of 
[0,2] and comparing them to the final p-value (as determined by a stratified log-rank test comparing

treatment arms) gave the following results, displayed in Figure 4.

Proceeding to the second stage of the TSE method using the estimated acceleration factor of 0.382, the 
OS time for all crossover patients (who are henceforth treated as adjusted chemotherapy patients) was 
replaced by their counterfactual survival time 
. Then, all patients were modelled using typical survival 
methods and compared using both Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards model. 
𝑈𝑈
First, using a Kaplan-Meier approach (Figure 5) comparing rucaparib vs adjusted chemotherapy, which 
suggested improved OS for rucaparib patients (stratified log-rank p = 0.0133 in favor of rucaparib). 
Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier Estimates Using Counterfactual Survival Times – Final OS Analysis (ITT 
Population) 
Lastly, using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, incorporating randomization strata of platinum 
status, yielded similar OS results (see Table 2). 
Assessment report

Page 217/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2. Cox Proportional Model Using Counterfactual Survival Times – Final OS (ITT 
Population) 
An HR >1 is an increase in hazard, meaning worse survival. Similarly, an HR <1 is an improvement in 
survival. Thus, we see that the HR of OS comparing rucaparib vs adjusted chemotherapy is estimated to 
be significantly less than 1 (in favor of rucaparib). The randomization stratum (partially platinum-
sensitive, platinum-sensitive, or platinum-resistant) is, as expected, found to be a significant predictor of 
OS and thus used as a stratification factor in the design of the study (as seen by p-values < 0.05 in Table 
2). The platinum-sensitive group is the reference group, so hazard ratios greater than 1 in Table 2, mean 
there is an increase in hazard (and thus a decrease in survival) for that group relative to the platinum-
sensitive reference group (in other words, the survival is best in the platinum-sensitive group, as would 
be expected). 
Conclusion  
In conclusion, when interpreting final OS, it is important to account for the fact that this study had a high 
proportion of crossover. In total, 90% of the patients enrolled in ARIEL4 received treatment with 
rucaparib, with 69% of the patients in the chemotherapy control group crossing over to receive rucaparib. 
The median OS in patients randomized to rucaparib within the platinum subgroups of ARIEL4 seems 
consistent with reported median OS in Phase 3 trials that evaluated platinum-based or paclitaxel 
treatment in the recurrent setting. 
The analysis of final OS for the ITT population by initial randomization groups shows a difference in OS in 
favour of chemotherapy when no adjustment is made to account for the patients that crossed over to 
rucaparib. Three additional models that account for the effect of crossover have been presented. The first 
is a simple model (method 1 of the guideline EMA/845963/2018) where data are censored at crossover, 
which resulted in no difference in OS (HR = 1.06, p = 0.7949). The second model is a Cox proportional 
hazards model with a time-dependent covariate for the start of rucaparib, which also resulted in no 
difference in OS (HR = 0.912, p = 0.673). Finally, the MAH used a TSE model to adjust for crossover, 
which resulted in an estimate of OS (HR = 0.697, p = 0.0117) that was significantly better in the 
rucaparib arm versus chemotherapy. Therefore, the MAH concludes that any type of analysis adjusting for 
crossover on final OS supports that there is no detriment in OS associated with rucaparib treatment. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As a consequence of major concerns due to the detrimental effect on the OS endpoint observed in some 
analyses, the Applicant was requested to provide a number of sensitivity analyses oriented at 
disentangling the effect of the crossover from the chemotherapy arm to the rucaparib arm. Analyses for 
both the interim and final data results stages have been reported.  
The MAH has presented three sensitivity analyses partially following the “Question and answer on 
adjustment for cross-over in estimating effects in oncology trials” document (EMA/845963/2018). From 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 218/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 3 recommended complex statistical methods, the MAH has presented the analysis following the two-
stage method and has provided some arguments to discard the Inverse Probability of Censoring 
Weighting (IPCW) and the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time models (RPSFT) approaches. 
The MAH has provided results from 5 different strategies: (1) excluding of patients who crossed over, (2) 
censoring patients at crossover, (3) and adaptation of the time-varying analyses for the treatment effect, 
and the (4) two-stage method and finally (5) a tipping-point sensitivity analysis. The following table 
(prepared by the assessors) shows some of the most relevant analyses results, which includes the 
standard analysis ignoring crossover plus the first 4 of the 5 methods listed above. 
Of note, conventional methods adjusting for cross-over were performed on updated data, the more 
complex methods were based on the interim OS data of September 2020 and the MAH proposed to 
update them later using the final OS data.

Overall, the uncertainties triggered by the standard analyses approach, considering all data and ignoring 
crossover, remain and cannot be considered ruled out by the results of the provided analyses. In fact, 
this standard analysis resembles what it might be expected as a result of the decision to treat, following 
the intention-to-treat principle as well as the treatment policy strategy for handling intercurrent events. 
This said, it is acknowledged that the HR from these analyses, which varied between 1.30 to 1.55 (some 
even statistically significant), does not reflect exclusively the direct treatment effect but a mixture of 
effects, including the ‘contamination’ by the crossed-over treatment and the potential additional 
confounding by the differential patients’ characteristics of the crossed-over patients. In this scenario, and 
in the absence of a direct randomised comparison for assessing the effect of the cross over, all analyses 
are considered of interest for assessing this effect.  
Notably, the MAH has declined to conduct two of the analyses recommended in the EMA Q&A document 
referred above (EMA/845963/2018), despite requested. For the IPCW, it was argued that “the lack of 
time-dependent covariates in this study would mean that only unstabilized weights could be used and 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 219/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thus this method cannot be implemented as recommended”. While it is acknowledged that not all 
interesting time-dependent covariates might be available, variables reflecting the patient status which 
include covariates such as ECOG, progression, laboratory data other than circulating tumour DNA 
[ctDNA], might have been used for the analysis. In any case, the reasoning is not considered sufficient to 
preclude the conduction of this IPCW analysis. For the RPSFT, the MAH has declined to conduct this 
analysis arguing that the non-testable assumption of the “common treatment effect” is a major and 
absolute limitation. The “common treatment effect” means that the treatment effect would not depend on 
whether it was received after randomisation or later at the point of crossover. Again, while it may be a 
limitation, the argumentation on why this analysis is not worth run, is not considered sufficient at all. It is 
highlighted that a very strong detrimental effect for OS was found in the standard analysis and that any 
analysis would be helpful to better understand the results. 
The exclusion of patients who crossed-over leads to statistically significant protective HR, varying from 
0.42 to 0.45. However, this analysis is considered as the most biased approach and therefore not even 
considered in the EMA referred Q&A document to adjust for cross-over. Thus, the reported HR cannot be 
considered as positive or even reassuring result from a regulatory point of view. 
Censoring patients at crossover is one of the 4 approaches of the referred EMA Q&A document, but it is 
clearly stated in that document that “censoring is often anti-conservative and cannot be recommended”. 
Therefore, it is only considered as one of the additional analyses. Of note, the HR is still above one (1.06) 
and taken into account also the wideness of the 95%CI, it is concluded that the major concern on OS still 
remains. 
The MAH provided also results from time-varying analyses to assess the treatment effect along the trial 
follow-up. There are 2 factors which assess the treatment effect in this model: a “Z” fixed factor for the 
randomisation to the control arm and the time-dependent “X” factor for the exposure to rucaparib at any 
time. It was already stated in previous rounds of assessment that this approach had several 
methodological concerns. First, the two treatment factors are being influenced by each other. While this 
model might be used as one of among a list of analyses, it is difficult to determine which one could be 
considered more appropriate post-hoc. Actually, the objective in that analysis should had been the effect 
of the exposure to rucaparib (the X factor) at any time without the effect of the randomisation to avoid 
estimating a mixture of effects when assessing the rucaparib potential benefit/harm. This analysis has not 
been conducted and the interpretation of the results made by the MAH cannot be endorsed, at least 
without the above referred time-dependent analysis requested. Also, this observational analysis on the 
randomised trial would have needed (reasonable and scientifically justified) lagged windows of effect and 
the use of time-dependent covariates at different time points (with at least the patient severity status at 
crossover). 
The MAH has provided results using the two-stage estimation (TSE) model, which is only of the 3 complex 
statistical methods referred in the EMA Q&A document, despite it has been previously recommended to 
conduct and submit the results from all those analyses. It is noted that not only the 2 discarded 
strategies but also the TSE method has underlying assumptions. In fact, the MAH has used a parametric 
accelerated failure time model based on the Weibull distribution, which per se is just one among a 
number of alternatives, and where different settings for parameters may be used for fitting the final 
model. In essence, the acceleration factor, which is the key in the TSE model, might be different in 
different scenarios which have not been shown or discussed. Also, there is a more than notable change in 
the risk estimates between the IA (HR: 0.96) and the final analyses (HR: 0.67 and statistically 
significant). Overall, the TSE method as the only conducted analysis among the regulatory recommended 
methods is considered to show very unstable results and they do not help to mitigate the uncertainties 
regarding the potential detrimental effect on OS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 220/234 
 
 
 
 
As per the “tipping-points” analysis, the MAH provided a series of values of the acceleration factor. The 
interpretation of this analysis should be assessed together with the TSE, and the results cannot be 
considered sufficiently robust and compelling given the limitations discussed above. 
Finally, it is noted that since there is no single best universal method, the lack of analysis using the IPCW 
and the RPST strategies is regretted. The EMA Q&A document to adjust for crossover states: 
“Given that the underlying assumptions of the adjustment methods for cross-over described above can in 
principle not be proven to be true, a positive result from an analysis adjusted for cross-over cannot be 
used to rescue a trial that is negative as per other evidence, or to ascertain that a treatment confers an 
OS advantage when this is not apparent in an analysis that does not (strongly) depend on unverifiable 
assumptions, such as an ‘ITT-analysis’ that uses the observed OS outcome for each patient. For these 
reasons, these analyses may only be useful for regulatory purposes as supportive or sensitivity analyses 
with (as outlined above) a clearly demonstrated robustness against deviations from the underlying 
assumptions.” 
In summary, even though some of the sensitivity analyses have displayed non-negative OS results with 
regards to the effect of rucaparib over the chemotherapy arm, several concerns that have been 
previously described do not allow such a conclusion from a regulatory perspective. For this reason and 
taking into account all the above discussion, it cannot be considered that a detrimental effect on OS can 
be ruled-out and this uncertainty cannot be considered resolved. Further, in view that the MAH has 
requested to remove the third line treatment indication from the product information (see question 1), 
this issue will no longer be pursued. 
Conclusion 
Issue not further pursued. 
Question 6 
The MAH is requested to submit the final analysis for OS and updated PFS2 results when available (REC 
already proposed). This report should include OS results by platinum sensitivity randomization status. In 
addition, potential cases of secondary MDS/AML are expected to be presented at the time of this final 
analysis. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Final analysis for Top-line OS and PFS2 results 
Top-line final OS and second event of progression-free survival (PFS2) analyses using a data cut-off of 10 
April 2022 are shown in Table 1 for the ITT and Efficacy Populations, and also for the platinum status 
subgroups. The Kaplan-Meier curves for the Efficacy, ITT, and the platinum subgroups are presented in 
Figure 1 to Figure 11 below. 
Overall Survival 
At the time of the final OS analysis, 70% (244/349) of death events had occurred in the ITT Population. 
The platinum-resistant subgroup was more mature (77.5% [139/179]) than the platinum-sensitive 
subgroup which had 61.8% (105/170) OS events and was comprised of the PPS (69.8% [67/96]) and the 
FPS subgroups (51.4% [38/74]). 
The HR for OS between rucaparib and chemotherapy patients in the ITT Population of ARIEL4 was 1.31 
(95% CI, 1.00-1.73; p = 0.0507). This analysis was heavily confounded by crossover to rucaparib of 
patients who were initially randomized treated with chemotherapy, (69% [80/116] patients) and also by 
the different outcomes in the platinum subgroups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 221/234 
 
 
 
 
 
In the platinum-sensitive population (FPS and PPS), there was no significant difference in OS between 
patients randomized to the rucaparib versus chemotherapy. The median OS was 29.4 months in the 
rucaparib arm vs. 27.6 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.07 [95% CI, 0.71-1.62]; p = 0.7455). 
This result is also consistent with the results from the randomized Phase 3 trial SOLO3, which compared 
the PARPi olaparib with chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive disease, but which did not 
include a platinum comparator (HR 1.07 [95% CI, 0.76-1.49]). In the SOLO3 trial, a high proportion of 
patients randomized to comparator also received PARPi as a subsequent line of therapy. 
The difference in OS seems to be driven by the result in platinum-resistant patients. The subgroup whose 
population is not within the current approved treatment indication for Rubraca. Although the median OS 
estimates in the platinum-resistant subgroup are longer in patients randomized to weekly paclitaxel 
versus rucaparib (22.2 vs 14.2 months), the OS in platinum-resistant patients receiving paclitaxel in 
ARIEL4 is considerably longer than outcomes reported for paclitaxel in trials of women with platinum 
resistant ovarian cancer (13.2 to 15.5 months) while the outcomes in the patients randomized to 
rucaparib are within the range expected with standard of care in this setting.

PFS2 is the time from randomization until progression on the line of therapy after the first trial therapy. 
At the time of final analysis, the PFS2 data were 80.6 % (262/325 and 81.9% (286/349) mature) in the 
Efficacy and ITT Populations, respectively. Similar to the interim PFS2 results, there was no significant 
difference between rucaparib treatment and chemotherapy treatment for PFS2 in either the Efficacy 
Population or ITT Population in the final analysis.

Conclusion: Final ARIEL4 Overall Survival 
ARIEL4 included a broad spectrum of ovarian cancer patients with platinum sensitive or platinum resistant 
disease. Within the platinum sensitive group, those with PPS disease were randomized to rucaparib or 
paclitaxel, and those with FPS disease were randomized to rucaparib or a platinum regimen. 
Although the HR has improved in the final OS analysis, in the overall trial population, the HR continues to 
favour chemotherapy. However, the results between the subgroups based on platinum subgroups differ 
markedly. When considering the EMA approved indication, this is important, because the approved 
indication only applies to patients with platinum-sensitive disease who can no longer tolerate further 
platinum. 
In the OS analysis of all platinum sensitive patients in ARIEL4, PFS2 favours rucaparib, the median OS is 
longer for rucaparib as compared to chemotherapy (29.4 months vs. 27.6 months) with a HR of 1.07 
(95% CI 0.71-1.62; p = 0.746). These results are similar those reported for another PARPi in the SOLO3 
randomized Phase 3 trial which evaluated olaparib versus chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive patients 
harbouring a BRCA mutation but which did not include platinum as a comparator (HR 1.07 [95% CI, 0.76-
1.49]; p = 0.714).6 As in ARIEL4, the primary endpoint in SOLO3 was PFS. Taken together, the results 
from ARIEL4 and SOLO3 suggest a beneficial effect of PARPi treatment with no decrement in OS in the 
overall platinum-sensitive population. 
The PPS subgroup is most relevant to the approved indication. In that subgroup, without making any 
adjustments for the confounding effects of the high rate of crossover, all efficacy endpoints, including the 
primary endpoint of PFS, the longer-term benefit endpoint of PFS2 and the OS endpoint support a 
positive benefit:risk of rucaparib for monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, 
relapsed or progressive, BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian,

fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of 
platinum based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum based chemotherapy. 
An ARIEL 4 CSR addendum, which will include these analyses together with final OS, PFS2, and updated 
safety will be provided to the EMA in 3Q 2022. 
MDS/AML Incidence in Final ARIEL4 Analysis 
Between the visit cut-off for the initial ARIEL4 CSR of 30 September 2020 and the visit cut-off for the 
final OS analysis (10 April 2022), 2 additional cases of MDS were reported in patients who were 
randomized to the rucaparib arm. In total, 7 cases of MDS/AML (MDS = 6 cases, AML = 1 case) were 
reported for patients randomized to the rucaparib arm of ARIEL4. No cases have been reported in 
patients who crossed over to rucaparib from the chemotherapy arm. Of the 7 cases of MDS/AML, 3 cases 
of MDS were treatment emergent and the other 4 cases of MDS/AML (MDS = 3, AML = 1) occurred 
during long term follow up. 
A Table summarizing the survival status for the 7 patients with reported cases of MDS/AML was provided.  
As mentioned, an ARIEL4 CSR Addendum, which will include updated safety will be provided to the EMA 
in 3Q 2022. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided top-line results from the final analysis of OS and exploratory data for PFS2. A CSR 
addendum will be submitted later this year. Regarding OS, the platinum-resistant subgroup was more 
mature (77.5%) than the platinum-sensitive subgroup (61.8%). Data maturity was about 81% for the 
final PFS2 analysis.  
The results from the final OS analysis (DCO 10-Apr-2022) have shown a HR of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.73; 
p = 0.0507) in the ITT population. This is slightly better than the one reported at the time of the OS 
interim analysis and not statistically significant. By randomization subgroups (platinum sensitivity status), 
the worst results are again reported for the platinum-resistant population with a HR of 1.51 (95% CI: 
1.05, 2.17) p = 0.0251. In platinum sensitive patients (fully and partially) a HR for OS of 1.07 (95% CI: 
0.71, 1.62; p = 0.7455) is reported (pooled data) while separate results show better results in the 
partially platinum sensitive subgroup with a HR of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.62; p = 0.9129) while the HR is 
of 1.24 (95% CI: 0.62, 2.50; p = 0.5405) in the fully platinum-sensitive population. The KM curves have 
been included and are quite similar to the ones available at the time of the interim OS analysis.  
PFS2 results by subgroups and for the Efficacy and ITT Populations have also been provided. These are 
considered as supportive analyses considering that final results for OS are available. All estimated HRs 
favour rucaparib but the 95% confidence intervals include the unity in all cases. Again, the worst results 
are observed in the platinum resistant subgroup, in line with the reported OS data.  
Of note, the MAH has sent a notification to request the removal of the “treatment” indication from the PI. 
In view of the remaining unresolved uncertainties regarding the observed OS detriment in the ARIEL4 
study, it is currently not possible to confirm the positive B/R of rucaparib in the third line treatment 
indication and the proposal from the MAH to remove the indication is acknowledged and considered 
necessary, see also question 1. 
Regarding MDS/AML incidence, based on the latest cut-off (10 April 2022), 2 additional cases of MDS 
have been reported in patients randomized to rucaparib. In the overall study, 7 cases of MDS/AML have 
been notified. One patient died due to MDS. Although their causal relationship with rucaparib can be 
questioned as development of such pathologies is a known risk of platinum-based chemotherapy, it

cannot be excluded. MDS/AML is already included in the SmPC and the new reported cases of MDS/AML 
were incorporated in a revised PI provided after circulation of the preliminary assessment report. Further 
information about cases of MDS/AML is expected at the time when the final CSR will be submitted (see 
below). 
Since the ‘treatment’ indication is removed, no further efficacy data from the ARIEL4 study are formally 
required. However, the MAH should provide updated safety from the ARIEL4 study with the final CSR in 
order to update the PI (REC). The MAH proposed that section 4.8 of the SmPC will include safety data 
from a pooled analysis of studies where ovarian cancer patients received rucaparib monotherapy at the 
same posology, and therefore including also the ARIEL4 study (even if the treatment indication will no 
longer be approved). 
Conclusion 
Issue solved.  
Clinical safety 
Question 7 
Regarding study ARIEL4, the MAH is requested to provide: i) safety data of intestinal obstruction adjusted 
by treatment exposure; ii) the narratives of all patients that reported an event of intestinal obstruction 
during the study. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Table 1 presents a summary of TEAEs of intestinal obstruction (MedDRA preferred terms [PTs]: intestinal 
obstruction, large intestinal obstruction, and small intestinal obstruction) occurring during the Treatment 
Part of ARIEL4 as incidence per 100 patient-years to account for and normalize differing duration of 
exposure to the study drug between rucaparib and chemotherapy groups. 
Table 1. Summary of TEAEs of Combined Intestinal Obstructiona per 100 Patient-years of 
Treatment – Treatment Part (Safety Population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/883431/2022 
Page 231/234 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taking duration of treatment into account, the number of TEAEs of intestinal obstruction is more 
comparable between treatment groups (8.0 events per 100 patient-years of treatment for rucaparib vs 
4.8 events per 100 patient-years for chemotherapy). In particular, when related TEAEs are considered, 
the numbers are very similar (0.6 events per 100 patient-years of treatment for rucaparib vs 0 events 
per 100 patient-years for chemotherapy). In addition, the numbers of TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation or dose reduction or interruption are comparable between treatment groups. Overall, 
these numbers do not indicate a safety concern regarding intestinal obstruction following administration 
of rucaparib. 
Narratives for patients who received rucaparib during the Treatment Part of the study, patients who 
received chemotherapy during the Treatment Part of the study, and patients who received chemotherapy 
during the Treatment Part of the study then crossed over to receive rucaparib have been provided. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Intestinal obstruction is a common complication of advanced gynaecological tumours, where peritoneal 
disease is often present. In study ARIEL4, a higher incidence of intestinal obstructions was reported with 
rucaparib, compared to chemotherapy. As longer treatment duration with rucaparib could have played a 
role in these reported results, the MAH was request to provide exposure-adjusted incidences of these 
events. The submitted results still show higher incidence in the rucaparib arm but the imbalances seem to 
be smaller (8.0 events per 100 patient-years of treatment for rucaparib vs. 4.8 events per 100 patient-
years for chemotherapy). For related AEs, the numbers were 0.6 events per 100 patient-years of 
treatment for rucaparib vs. 0 events per 100 patient-years for chemotherapy. 
Narratives for the patients reporting TEAEs of intestinal obstruction in both treatment arms have been 
provided. All patients, similarly to the overall included population in this study, presented metastatic 
cancer, after several treatment lines and some of them had already suffered an episode of intestinal 
obstruction during previous chemotherapy treatment regimens. Some of the patients were on progressive 
disease at the time of the event but others were in response. Most of the cases were considered not 
related to treatment by the investigators but related to the disease under investigation. It is difficult to 
exclude any possibility of relation between rucaparib and cases of intestinal obstruction but, although it is 
agreed that the underlying disease may have played a relevant role based on the exposure-adjusted 
rates and previous observations of intestinal obstruction, including serious events (Rubraca EPARs 
EMA/CHMP/238139/2018, EMA/902679/2019), information on this AE should be included in the SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 4.8. The MAH has added intestinal obstruction in sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC in a 
revised PI provided after circulation of the preliminary assessment report. However the text proposed in 
section 4.4 is not considered informative and is therefore not agreed. Even if a reference to that reports 
could be confounded by the underlying disease may be kept, a description of the reported events 
(seriousness, fatal cases) should also be included together with guidance how to proceed in case of a 
suspected event. The MAH is requested to make a proposal.

Product information 
Question 1 
Intestinal obstruction has been included as ADR in the SmPC (sections 4.4 and 4.8). However the text 
proposed in section 4.4 is not considered informative and is therefore not agreed. Even if a reference to 
that reports could be confounded by the underlying disease may be kept, a description of the reported 
events (seriousness, fatal cases) should also be included together with guidance how to proceed in case 
of a suspected event. The MAH is requested to make a proposal. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
An initial proposal for information to be included in section 4.4 was made by the MAH that was not agreed 
as it was considered not informative. It was noted that a description of the reported events (seriousness, 
fatal cases) should be included together with guidance how to proceed in case of a suspected event. The 
MAH has made the following proposal:  
“Intestinal obstruction 
Intestinal obstruction has been observed in patients treated with rucaparib; 4.5% of ovarian cancer 
patients experienced a serious event of intestinal obstruction, with a fatal outcome of less than 0.1%. 
Reports are confounded as underlying disease may play a role in the development of intestinal 
obstruction in patients with ovarian cancer. In the event of suspected intestinal obstruction, perform a 
prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately.” 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The proposal made by the MAH is not entirely agreed. The following text is proposed (new text added; 
text deleted):  
“Intestinal obstruction

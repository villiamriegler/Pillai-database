CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Dengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 
and 4 in individuals 6 to 45 years of age with test-confirmed previous dengue infection (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
The use of Dengvaxia should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Children and adults 6 to 45 years of age 
The vaccination schedule consists of 3 injections of one reconstituted dose (0.5 mL) to be 
administered at 6-month intervals. 
Booster dose 
The added value of and appropriate timing for booster dose(s) have not been established. Current 
available data are included in section 5.1.

Paediatric population aged less than 6 years 
The safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia in children less than 6 years of age have not been established. 
Dengvaxia should not be used in children less than 6 years of age (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Method of administration 
Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm in the 
region of deltoid. 
Do not administer by intravascular injection. 
For instructions on reconstitution of Dengvaxia before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or after prior 
administration of Dengvaxia or a vaccine containing the same components. 
Individuals with congenital or acquired cell-mediated immune deficiency, including 
immunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g. 
20mg or 2mg/kg of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. 
Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied 
by evidence of impaired immune function. 
Pregnant women (see section 4.6). 
Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an 
anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. 
Latex 
The tip caps of the prefilled syringes contain a natural rubber latex derivative, which may cause 
allergic reactions in latex sensitive. 
Intercurrent illness 
Administration of Dengvaxia must be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe 
febrile or acute disease. 
Syncope  
Syncope can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to injection 
with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling and to manage syncopal 
reactions.

Prior dengue infection pre-vaccination screening 
Individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus should not be vaccinated because 
of an increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue and clinically severe dengue observed during the 
long-term follow up of the clinical studies in vaccinated individuals not previously infected (see 
section 4.8). 
In the absence of documented prior dengue virus infection, previous infection must be confirmed by a 
test before vaccination. To avoid vaccination of false positives, only test methods with adequate 
performance in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity based on the local disease epidemiology 
should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 
In non-endemic areas or low transmission settings, the use of the vaccine should be restricted to 
individuals who have high probability of future exposure to dengue. 
The lower the proportion of true seropositive individuals, the higher the risk of false seropositives with 
any test used to determine dengue serostatus. Thus, pre-vaccination testing and vaccination should be 
limited to individuals with high probability of past dengue infection (e.g. individuals who lived before 
or had recurrent stay in endemic areas). The objective is to minimise the risk of a false positive test.  
Special populations 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during at least one month after 
each dose (see section 4.6). 
Travellers 
There are no clinical data to support vaccination of individuals living in non-endemic areas with low 
probability of past dengue infection and who only occasionally travel to endemic areas, therefore 
vaccination of these individuals is not recommended. 
Protection 
A protective immune response with Dengvaxia may not be elicited in all vaccinees. It is recommended 
to continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. 
Dengvaxia contains phenylalanine and sodium  
Dengvaxia contains 41 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be 
harmful for people with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds 
up because the body cannot remove it properly. 
Dengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Vaccine-drug interaction 
For patients receiving treatment with immunoglobulins or blood products containing 
immunoglobulins, such as blood or plasma, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 weeks, and 
preferably for 3 months, following the end of treatment before administering Dengvaxia, in order to 
avoid neutralization of the attenuated viruses contained in the vaccine. 
Dengvaxia should not be administered to subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as 
chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to vaccination (see 
section 4.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vaccine-vaccine interaction  
Dengvaxia has been evaluated in one clinical study on concomitant administration with Tdap (Tetanus 
Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed) (629 dengue 
seropositive subjects at baseline, 9 to 60 years of age). The non-inferiority of the humoral immune 
response to all Tdap antigens elicited by the Tdap booster dose concomitantly administered with the 
first dose of Dengvaxia compared to sequential administration was achieved, when measured 28 days 
after Tdap booster dose in dengue seropositive subjects. In dengue seropositive subjects, the first dose 
of Dengvaxia induced a similar immune response (in terms of geometric mean titres [GMTs] and 
seropositivity rates) against all 4 dengue serotypes in both concomitant and sequential administration 
groups.   
Dengvaxia has been evaluated in two clinical studies with bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines 
(Human Papillomavirus Vaccine, Recombinant) (305 dengue seropositive subjects at baseline, 9 to 14 
years of age and 197 dengue seropositive subjects at baseline, 9 to 13 years of age). The non-
inferiority of the humoral immune response to bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines / Dengvaxia at 
28 days after the last injection could not be assessed because the number of evaluable subjects was 
limited. Immunogenicity analyses in the concomitant administration group and in the sequential 
administration group were only descriptive.  
Bivalent HPV vaccine showed similar GMTs in both concomitant and sequential administration 
groups and GMT ratios between groups (concomitant/sequential administration) were near to 1 for 
both HPV-16 and HPV-18. The GMT ratios between groups (concomitant/sequential administration) 
were close to 1 for all 4 dengue serotypes. 
For the quadrivalent HPV, GMT ratios between groups (concomitant/sequential administration) were 
close to 1 for HPV-6, and around 0.80 for HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18. The GMTs ratios between 
groups (concomitant/sequential administration) were close to 1 for serotypes 1 and 4, and close to 0.80 
for serotypes 2 and 3.  
The clinical relevance of these observations is not known. 
There was no evidence of an increased rate of reactogenicity or change in the safety profile of the 
vaccines when Tdap or HPV vaccines were administered concomitantly with Dengvaxia in any of 
these studies.   
If Dengvaxia is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always 
be administered at different injection sites. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential  
As with other live attenuated vaccines, women of childbearing potential have to use effective 
contraception during at least one month after each dose. 
Pregnancy 
Animal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). 
There is limited amount of data from the use of Dengvaxia in pregnant women. These data are not 
sufficient to conclude on the absence of potential effects of Dengvaxia on pregnancy, embryo-foetal 
development, parturition and post-natal development. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine, therefore Dengvaxia is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 
section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Animal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to lactation. 
There is very limited experience on dengue virus excretion via breast milk. 
Also, considering that Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine and that there is very limited experience 
from post marketing data with Dengvaxia in breast-feeding women, the vaccine is contraindicated 
during lactation (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
No specific studies have been performed on fertility. 
Animal studies did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Dengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported reactions were headache (51%), injection site pain (49%), malaise 
(41%), myalgia (41%), asthenia (32%), and fever (14%). 
Adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination except fever which appears within 14 
days after the injection. The adverse reactions were of short duration (0 to 3 days). 
Systemic adverse reactions tended to be less frequent after the second and third injections of 
Dengvaxia as compared to the first injection. 
Overall, the same adverse reactions but at lower frequencies were observed in dengue seropositive 
subjects.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories:  
Very common: ≥ 1/10 
Common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 
Uncommon: ≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100 
Rare: ≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1000 
Very rare: (<1/10 000) 
The safety profile presented in Table 1 is based on a pooled analysis from selected clinical studies and 
commercial use.

Hospitalised and/or clinically severe dengue fever in long-term safety follow-up data 
In an exploratory analysis of the long-term follow up from the first injection in three efficacy studies, 
an increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue including clinically severe dengue (predominantly 
Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever grade 1 or 2 [WHO 1997]) has been observed in vaccinees with no 
previous dengue infection. Data obtained in the pivotal clinical studies show that over a period of 6 
years, in subjects with no previous dengue infection, the risk of severe dengue is increased in subjects 
7 
 
 
 
 
6 to 16 years of age vaccinated with Dengvaxia as compared to non-vaccinated subjects in the same 
age group. Estimates from the long-term analysis suggest the onset of increased risk was mainly 
during the 3rd year following the first injection.  
This increased risk was not observed in individuals who have been previously infected by dengue 
virus (refer to Section 5.1).  
Paediatric population 
Paediatric data in subjects 6 to 17 years of age 
In paediatric population, fever and injection site erythema have been observed with a higher frequency 
(very common) than in adults (common). 
Urticaria (rare) was only reported in subjects 6 to 17 years of age.  
Paediatric data in subjects below 6 years of age, i.e., outside the age indication 
The reactogenicity subset in subjects below 6 years of age includes 2192 subjects as follows: 1287 
subjects below 2 years of age and 905 subjects between 2 and 5 years of age. 
In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, as compared to subjects above 6 years of age, injection site swelling 
was more frequently reported (frequency: very common), and additional adverse reactions were 
reported (frequency: uncommon): rash maculo-papular and decreased appetite. 
In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, with no previous dengue infection, long-term safety follow-up data 
showed an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalisation including clinically severe 
dengue in vaccinated subjects as compared to non-vaccinated subjects (see section 4.4).   
In subjects below 2 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions following any 
injection of Dengvaxia were fever, irritability, appetite lost, abnormal crying and injection site 
tenderness. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
No cases of overdose have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX04 
Mechanism of action 
Dengvaxia contains live attenuated viruses. Following administration, the viruses replicate locally and 
elicit neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses against the four dengue virus 
serotypes.

Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of Dengvaxia was assessed in 3 studies: one supportive Phase IIb efficacy study 
(CYD23) in Thailand, and 2 pivotal large-scale Phase III efficacy studies, CYD14 in Asia (Indonesia, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and CYD15 in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, 
Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico). 
In the Phase IIb study, a total of 4002 subjects aged 4 to 11 years were randomised to receive 
Dengvaxia or a control, regardless of previous dengue infection. Of these subjects 3285 subjects were 
6 to 11 years of age (2184 in vaccine group and 1101 in Control Group). 
In the two pivotal Phase III studies (CYD14 and CYD15), a total of approximately 31000 subjects 
aged 2 to 16 years were randomised to receive either Dengvaxia or placebo, regardless of previous 
dengue infection.  Of these subjects, 19 107 subjects who received Dengvaxia (5193 subjects in 
CYD14 and 13914 in CYD15) and 9538 subjects who received placebo (2598 in CYD14 and 6940 in 
CYD15) were 6 to 16 years of age. 
At the start of the CYD14 and CYD15 studies, dengue seroprevalence for the overall population at the 
study sites ranged from 52.8%-81.1% in CYD14 (Asia-Pacific) and 55.7%-92.7% in CYD15 (Latin 
America). 
The efficacy was assessed during an Active Phase of 25 months, in which surveillance was designed 
to maximize the detection of all symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases regardless 
of the severity. The active detection of symptomatic dengue cases started on the day of the first 
injection and lasted until 13 months after the third injection.  
For the primary endpoint, the incidence of symptomatic VCD cases occurring during the 12-month 
period from 28 days after the third injection was compared between the vaccine and the Control 
Group. 
Exploratory vaccine efficacy analyses according to dengue serostatus measured by plaque reduction 
neutralization test (PRNT50) at baseline (before the first injection) were performed in the 
immunogenicity subset of 2000 subjects each in CYD14 and CYD15 and 300 subjects in CYD23. Of 
the 2580 subjects 6 to 16 years old in this subset (approximately 80%) who were dengue seropositive 
at baseline, 1729 subjects received the vaccine (656 subjects in CYD14 and 1073 in CYD15) and 851 
subjects received placebo (339 in CYD14 and 512 in CYD15) (see also subsection Immunogenicity). 
Clinical efficacy data for subjects 6 to 16 years of age in endemic areas, any serostatus at baseline 
The Vaccine Efficacy (VE) results according to the primary endpoint (symptomatic VCD cases 
occurring during the 25-month period after the first dose) in subjects 6 to 16 years of age (any 
serostatus at baseline) are shown in Table 2 for studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23.

The four serotypes contributed to the overall Vaccine Efficacy (VE). Data are limited because baseline 
immunostatus was initially collected in a limited subset of subjects. VE against symptomatic VCD due 
to serotype 1 [76.8 (46.1; 90.0)] and to serotype 2 [55.5 (-15.5; 82.8)] tends to be lower compared to 
serotypes 3 [89.6 (63.7; 97.0)] and serotype 4 [96.5 (73.4; 99.5)] during the 25-month period after the 
first dose, for subjects 6 to 16 years who are seropositive at baseline (immunogenicity subset of 
studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23). 
Efficacy tends to be slightly lower in the 6-8 years of age compared to children 9-16 years of age. 
VE against hospitalized and severe VCD cases in subjects 6 to 16 years of age 
In subjects 6 to 16 years of age, dengue seropositive at baseline (immunogenicity subset), two 
clinically severe VCD cases in CYD14 and one in CYD15 were reported during the 25-month period 
after the first injection in the control group versus none in the vaccine group. Eight hospitalized VCD 
cases in CYD14 were reported in the control group versus one in the vaccine group and two 
hospitalized VCD cases in CYD15 were reported in the control group versus none in the vaccine 
group. These data are inconclusive due to the low number of cases in the immunogenicity subset.  
Efficacy was assessed in moderate-high endemic areas. The magnitude of protection may not be 
extrapolated to other epidemiological situations. 
Clinical efficacy data for subjects 17 to 45 years of age in endemic areas 
No clinical efficacy study has been done in subjects from 17 to 45 years from endemic areas. The 
clinical efficacy of the vaccine is based on bridging of immunogenicity data (see below section  
Immunogenicity data for subjects 18 to 45 years of age in endemic areas). 
Long-term protection 
Limited data suggest a trend for efficacy to decrease over time. During the last 2 years of follow-up 
(Year 5 and 6) after the initial dose, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic VCD (Immunogenicity 
Subset, pooled CYD14+CYD15) was 14.6% (95% CI: -74.7; 58.3)  in subjects 6 to 16 years with 
previous dengue infection. Efficacy persistence may vary according to the epidemiological situations. 
Immunogenicity 
No immune correlate of protection has been established. During clinical development, 
immunogenicity data were collected in a total of 7262 subjects 9 months to 60 years of age that 
received at least one injection of the vaccine. 
Among these subjects, a total of 3498 subjects 6 to 45 years of age from endemic areas and dengue 
immune received at least one injection of Dengvaxia. Most of the subjects were 6 to 17 years of age 
(n=2836). 
During clinical development, neutralizing antibody titres for each serotype were measured with the 
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and presented as geometric mean titres (GMTs). 
In the following Tables the dengue serostatus at baseline (before the first injection), was defined as:  
• 
Dengue seropositivity if the PRNT50 titre ≥ 10 [1/dil] (the lower limit of quantification, 
LLOQ), against at least one serotype. 
Dengue seronegativity if the PRNT50 titre < the lower limit of quantification against any of the 
4 serotypes.

Immunogenicity data for subjects 18 to 45 years of age in endemic areas 
The immunogenicity of the final formulation of the CYD dengue vaccine in adults aged 18 to 45 years 
in endemic areas was assessed in 3 studies conducted all in Asia-Pacific (CYD22 in Vietnam, CYD28 
in Singapore and CYD47 in India). 
GMTs at baseline and 28 days post-dose 3 in subjects 18 to 45 years of age are shown in the Table 6

Dengue seropositive subjects are subjects with titres above or equal to LLOQ against at least one dengue serotype at baseline 
CI: Confidence Interval 
CYD28: Low endemic country 
CYD22: Vietnam; CYD28: Singapore; CYD47: India; 
The bridging of efficacy is based on above available data and overall results. Immunogenicity data 
available from studies in adults aged 18 to 45 years in endemic regions show that post-injection 3 
GMTs against each serotype are generally higher in adults than in children and adolescents in CYD14 
and CYD15. Therefore, protection is expected in adults in endemics areas although the actual 
magnitude of efficacy relative to that observed in children and adolescents is unknown. 
Long-term persistence of antibodies 
The GMTs persisted post dose 3 up to 5 years in subjects 6 years of age and older in studies CYD14 
and CYD15. At year 5 after the third injection, GMTs were still higher to pre-vaccination GMTs 
despite decrease in the GMTs against all 4 serotypes compared to post-dose 3 GMTs. The GMTs 
levels depend on age and dengue serostatus at baseline. 
The effect of a booster dose was assessed in subjects 9-50 years living in endemic areas after a 3-dose 
schedule (studies CYD63, CYD64, CYD65). No or modest transient increase of neutralizing Ab titers 
was observed after the boost. The booster effect was variable across serotypes and studies. Why there 
is a lack/limited booster effect with Dengvaxia remains not understood in terms of mechanisms and 
clinical implications. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed on Dengvaxia. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special risks for humans based on a repeated-dose toxicity 
including assessment of local tolerance, and a developmental and reproductive toxicology program. A 
neurovirulence study shows that CYD dengue vaccine is not neurotoxic.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
  Therapeutic indications  
Dengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 
and 4 in individuals 6 to 45 years of age with test-confirmed previous dengue infection (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
The use of Dengvaxia should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Children and adults 6 to 45 years of age 
The vaccination schedule consists of 3 injections of one reconstituted dose (0.5 mL) to be 
administered at 6-month intervals. 
Booster dose 
The added value of and appropriate timing for booster dose(s) have not been established. Current 
available data are included in section 5.1. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population aged less than 6 years 
The safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia in children less than 6 years of age have not been established. 
Dengvaxia should not be used in children less than 6 years of age (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Method of administration 
Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous  injection preferably in the upper arm in the 
region of deltoid. 
Do not administer by intravascular injection. 
For instructions on reconstitution of Dengvaxia before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or after prior 
administration of Dengvaxia or a vaccine containing the same components. 
Individuals with congenital or acquired cell-mediated immune deficiency, including 
immunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g. 
20mg or 2mg/kg of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. 
Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied 
by evidence of impaired immune function. 
Pregnant women (see section 4.6). 
Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an 
anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. 
Intercurrent illness 
Administration of Dengvaxia must be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe 
febrile or acute disease. 
Syncope  
Syncope can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to injection 
with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling and to manage syncopal 
reactions. 
Prior dengue infection pre-vaccination screening 
Individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus should not be vaccinated because 
of an increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue and clinically severe dengue observed during the 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
long-term follow up of the clinical studies in vaccinated individuals not previously infected (see 
section 4.8). 
In the absence of documented prior dengue virus infection, previous infection must be confirmed by a 
test before vaccination. To avoid vaccination of false positives, only test methods with adequate 
performance in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity based on the local disease epidemiology 
should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 
In non-endemic areas or low transmission settings, the use of the vaccine should be restricted to 
individuals who have high probability of future exposure to dengue. 
The lower the proportion of true seropositive individuals, the higher the risk of false seropositives with 
any test used to determine dengue serostatus. Thus, pre-vaccination testing and vaccination should be 
limited to individuals with high probability of past dengue infection (e.g. individuals who lived before 
or had recurrent stay in endemic areas). The objective is to minimise the risk of a false positive test.  
Special populations 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during at least one month after 
each dose (see section 4.6). 
Travellers 
There are no clinical data to support vaccination of individuals living in non-endemic areas with low 
probability of past dengue infection and who only occasionally travel to endemic areas, therefore 
vaccination of these individuals is not recommended. 
Protection 
A protective immune response with Dengvaxia may not be elicited in all vaccinees. It is recommended 
to continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. 
Dengvaxia contains phenylalanine and sodium  
Dengvaxia contains 8 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be 
harmful for people with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds 
up because the body cannot remove it properly. 
Dengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Vaccine-drug interaction 
For patients receiving treatment with immunoglobulins or blood products containing 
immunoglobulins, such as blood or plasma, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 weeks, and 
preferably for 3 months, following the end of treatment before administering Dengvaxia, in order to 
avoid neutralization of the attenuated viruses contained in the vaccine. 
Dengvaxia should not be administered to subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as 
chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to vaccination (see 
section 4.3). 
Vaccine-vaccine interaction 
Dengvaxia has been evaluated in one clinical study on concomitant administration with Tdap (Tetanus 
Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed) (629 dengue 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seropositive subjects at baseline, 9 to 60 years of age). The non-inferiority of the humoral immune 
response to all Tdap antigens elicited by the Tdap booster dose concomitantly administered with the 
first dose of Dengvaxia compared to sequential administration was achieved, when measured 28 days 
after Tdap booster dose in dengue seropositive subjects. In dengue seropositive subjects, the first dose 
of Dengvaxia induced a similar immune response (in terms of geometric mean titres [GMTs] and 
seropositivity rates) against all 4 dengue serotypes in both concomitant and sequential administration 
groups.   
Dengvaxia has been evaluated in two clinical studies with bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines 
(Human Papillomavirus Vaccine, Recombinant) (305 dengue seropositive subjects at baseline, 9 to 14 
years of age and 197 dengue seropositive subjects at baseline, 9 to 13 years of age). The non-
inferiority of the humoral immune response to bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines / Dengvaxia at 
28 days after the last injection could not be assessed because the number of evaluable subjects was 
limited. Immunogenicity analyses in the concomitant administration group and in the sequential 
administration group were only descriptive.  
Bivalent HPV vaccine showed similar GMTs in both concomitant and sequential administration 
groups and GMT ratios between groups (concomitant/sequential administration) were near to 1 for 
both HPV-16 and HPV-18. The GMT ratios between groups (concomitant/sequential administration) 
were close to 1 for all 4 dengue serotypes. 
For the quadrivalent HPV, GMT ratios between groups (concomitant/sequential administration) were 
close to 1 for HPV-6, and around 0.80 for HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18. The GMTs ratios between 
groups (concomitant/sequential administration) were close to 1 for serotypes 1 and 4, and close to 0.80 
for serotypes 2 and 3.  
The clinical relevance of these observations is not known. 
There was no evidence of an increased rate of reactogenicity or change in the safety profile of the 
vaccines when Tdap or HPV vaccines were administered concomitantly with Dengvaxia in any of 
these studies.   
If Dengvaxia is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always 
be administered at different injection sites. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential  
As with other live attenuated vaccines, women of childbearing potential have to use effective 
contraception during at least one month after each dose. 
Pregnancy 
Animal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). 
There is limited amount of data from the use of Dengvaxia in pregnant women. These data are not 
sufficient to conclude on the absence of potential effects of Dengvaxia on pregnancy, embryo-foetal 
development, parturition and post-natal development. 
Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine, therefore Dengvaxia is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 
section 4.3). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Animal studies did not indicate any direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to lactation. 
There is very limited experience on dengue virus excretion via breast milk. 
Also, considering that Dengvaxia is a live attenuated vaccine and that there is very limited experience 
from post marketing data with Dengvaxia in breast-feeding women, the vaccine is contraindicated 
during lactation (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
No specific studies have been performed on fertility. 
Animal studies did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Dengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported reactions were headache (51%), injection site pain (49%), malaise 
(41%), myalgia (41%), asthenia (32%), and fever (14%). 
Adverse reactions occurred within 3 days following vaccination except fever which appears within 14 
days after the injection. The adverse reactions were of short duration (0 to 3 days). 
Systemic adverse reactions tended to be less frequent after the second and third injections of 
Dengvaxia as compared to the first injection. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories:  
Very common: ≥ 1/10 
Common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 
Uncommon: ≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100 
Rare: ≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1000 
Very rare: (<1/10 000)

Hospitalised and/or clinically severe dengue fever in long-term safety follow-up data 
In an exploratory analysis of the long-term follow up from the first injection in three efficacy studies, 
an increased risk of hospitalisation for dengue including clinically severe dengue (predominantly 
Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever grade 1 or 2 [WHO 1997]) has been observed in vaccinees with no 
previous dengue infection. Data obtained in the pivotal clinical studies show that over a period of 6 
years, in subjects with no previous dengue infection, the risk of severe dengue is increased in subjects 
6 to 16 years of age vaccinated with Dengvaxia as compared to non-vaccinated subjects in the same 
21 
 
 
 
 
age group. Estimates from the long-term analysis suggest the onset of increased risk was mainly 
during the 3rd year following the first injection.  
This increased risk was not observed in individuals who have been previously infected by dengue 
virus (refer to Section 5.1).  
Paediatric population 
Paediatric data in subjects 6 to 17 years of age 
In paediatric population, fever and injection site erythema have been observed with a higher frequency 
(very common) than in adults (common). 
Urticaria (rare) was only reported in subjects 6 to 17 years of age. 
Paediatric data in subjects below 6 years of age, i.e., outside the age indication 
The reactogenicity subset in subjects below 6 years of age includes 2192 subjects as follows: 1287 
subjects below 2 years of age and 905 subjects between 2 and 5 years of age. 
In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, as compared to subjects above 6 years of age, injection site swelling 
was more frequently reported (frequency: very common), and additional adverse reactions were 
reported (frequency: uncommon): rash maculo-papular and decreased appetite. 
In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, with no previous dengue infection, long-term safety follow-up data 
showed an increased risk of dengue disease requiring hospitalisation including clinically severe 
dengue in vaccinated subjects as compared to non-vaccinated subjects (see section 4.4).   
In subjects below 2 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions following any 
injection of Dengvaxia were fever, irritability, appetite lost, abnormal crying and injection site 
tenderness. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
No cases of overdose have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX04 
Mechanism of action 
Dengvaxia contains live attenuated viruses. Following administration, the viruses replicate locally and 
elicit neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses against the four dengue virus 
serotypes.

Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of Dengvaxia was assessed in 3 studies: one supportive Phase IIb efficacy study 
(CYD23) in Thailand, and 2 pivotal large-scale Phase III efficacy studies, CYD14 in Asia (Indonesia, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and CYD15 in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, 
Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico). 
In the Phase IIb study, a total of 4002 subjects aged 4 to 11 years were randomised to receive 
Dengvaxia or a control, regardless of previous dengue infection. Of these subjects 3285 subjects were 
6 to 11 years of age (2184 in vaccine group and 1101 in Control Group). 
In the two pivotal Phase III studies (CYD14 and CYD15), a total of approximately 31000 subjects 
aged 2 to 16 years were randomised to receive either Dengvaxia or placebo, regardless of previous 
dengue infection.  Of these subjects, 19 107 subjects who received Dengvaxia (5193 subjects in 
CYD14 and 13914 in CYD15) and 9538 subjects who received placebo (2598 in CYD14 and 6940 in 
CYD15) were 6 to 16 years of age. 
At the start of the CYD14 and CYD15 studies, dengue seroprevalence for the overall population at the 
study sites ranged from 52.8%-81.1% in CYD14 (Asia-Pacific) and 55.7%-92.7% in CYD15 (Latin 
America). 
The efficacy was assessed during an Active Phase of 25 months, in which surveillance was designed 
to maximize the detection of all symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases regardless 
of the severity. The active detection of symptomatic dengue cases started on the day of the first 
injection and lasted until 13 months after the third injection.  
For the primary endpoint, the incidence of symptomatic VCD cases occurring during the 12-month 
period from 28 days after the third injection was compared between the vaccine and the Control 
Group. 
Exploratory vaccine efficacy analyses according to dengue serostatus measured by plaque reduction 
neutralization test (PRNT50) at baseline (before the first injection) were performed in the 
immunogenicity subset of 2000 subjects each in CYD14 and CYD15 and 300 subjects in CYD23. Of 
the 2580 subjects 6 to 16 years old in this subset (approximately 80%) who were dengue seropositive 
at baseline, 1729 subjects received the vaccine (656 subjects in CYD14 and 1073 in CYD15) and 851 
subjects received placebo (339 in CYD14 and 512 in CYD15) (see also subsection Immunogenicity). 
Clinical efficacy data for subjects 6 to 16 years of age in endemic areas, any serostatus at baseline 
The Vaccine Efficacy (VE) results according to the primary endpoint (symptomatic VCD cases 
occurring during the 25-month period after the first dose) in subjects 6 to 16 years of age (any 
serostatus at baseline) are shown in Table 2 for studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23.

The four serotypes contributed to the overall Vaccine Efficacy (VE). Data are limited because baseline 
immunostatus was initially collected in a limited subset of subjects. VE against symptomatic VCD due 
to serotype 1 [76.8 (46.1; 90.0)] and to serotype 2 [55.5 (-15.5; 82.8)] tends to be lower compared to 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
serotypes 3 [89.6 (63.7; 97.0)] and serotype 4 [96.5 (73.4; 99.5)] during the 25-month period after the 
first dose, for subjects 6 to 16 years who are seropositive at baseline (immunogenicity subset of 
studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23). 
Efficacy tends to be slightly lower in the 6-8 years of age compared to children 9-16 years of age. 
VE against hospitalized and severe VCD cases in subjects 6 to 16 years of age 
In subjects 6 to 16 years of age, dengue seropositive at baseline (immunogenicity subset), two 
clinically severe VCD cases in CYD14 and one in CYD15 were reported during the 25-month period 
after the first injection in the control group versus none in the vaccine group. Eight hospitalized VCD 
cases in CYD14 were reported in the control group versus one in the vaccine group and two 
hospitalized VCD cases in CYD15 were reported in the control group versus none in the vaccine 
group. These data are inconclusive due to the low number of cases in the immunogenicity subset.  
Efficacy was assessed in moderate-high endemic areas. The magnitude of protection may not be 
extrapolated to other epidemiological situations. 
Clinical efficacy data for subjects 17 to 45 years of age in endemic areas 
No clinical efficacy study has been done in subjects from 17 to 45 years from endemic areas. The 
clinical efficacy of the vaccine is based on bridging of immunogenicity data (see below section  
Immunogenicity data for subjects 18 to 45 years of age in endemic areas). 
Long-term protection 
Limited data suggest a trend for efficacy to decrease over time. During the last 2 years of follow-up 
(Year 5 and 6) after the initial dose, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic VCD (Immunogenicity 
Subset, pooled CYD14+CYD15) was 14.6% (95% CI: -74.7; 58.3)  in subjects 6 to 16 years with 
previous dengue infection. Efficacy persistence may vary according to the epidemiological situations. 
Immunogenicity 
No immune correlate of protection has been established. During clinical development, 
immunogenicity data were collected in a total of 7262 subjects 9 months to 60 years of age that 
received at least one injection of the vaccine. 
Among these subjects, a total of 3498 subjects 6 to 45 years of age from endemic areas and dengue 
immune received at least one injection of Dengvaxia. Most of the subjects were 6 to 17 years of age 
(n=2836). 
During clinical development, neutralizing antibody titres for each serotype were measured with the 
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and presented as geometric mean titres (GMTs). 
In the following Tables the dengue serostatus at baseline (before the first injection), was defined as:  
• 
Dengue seropositivity if the PRNT50 titre ≥ 10 [1/dil] (the lower limit of quantification, 
LLOQ), against at least one serotype. 
Dengue seronegativity if the PRNT50 titre < the lower limit of quantification against any of the 
4 serotypes.

Immunogenicity data for subjects 6 to 8 years of age in endemic areas 
GMTs at baseline and 28 days post-dose 3 in subjects 6 to 8 years of age in CYD14 are shown in the

CI: Confidence Interval 
CYD28: Low endemic country 
CYD22: Vietnam; CYD28: Singapore; CYD47: India; 
The bridging of efficacy is based on above available data and overall results. Immunogenicity data 
available from studies in adults aged 18 to 45 years in endemic regions show that post-injection 3 
GMTs against each serotype are generally higher in adults than in children and adolescents in CYD14 
and CYD15. Therefore, protection is expected in adults in endemics areas although the actual 
magnitude of efficacy relative to that observed in children and adolescents is unknown. 
Long-term persistence of antibodies 
The GMTs persisted post dose 3 up to 5 years in subjects 6 years of age and older in studies CYD14 
and CYD15. At year 5 after the third injection, GMTs were still higher to pre-vaccination GMTs 
despite decrease in the GMTs against all 4 serotypes compared to post-dose 3 GMTs. The GMTs 
levels depend on age and dengue serostatus at baseline. 
The effect of a booster dose was assessed in subjects 9-50 years living in endemic areas after a 3-dose 
schedule (studies CYD63, CYD64, CYD65). No or modest transient increase of neutralizing Ab titers 
was observed after the boost. The booster effect was variable across serotypes and studies. Why there 
is a lack/limited booster effect with Dengvaxia remains not understood in terms of mechanisms and 
clinical implications. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed on Dengvaxia. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special risks for humans based on a repeated-dose toxicity 
including assessment of local tolerance, and a developmental and reproductive toxicology program. A 
neurovirulence study shows that CYD dengue vaccine is not neurotoxic.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dengvaxia is and what it is used for  
Dengvaxia is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against "dengue disease" caused by 
dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. It contains versions of these 4 varieties of the virus that have 
been weakened so that they cannot cause the disease. 
Dengvaxia is given to adults, young people and children (from 6 to 45 years of age) with prior dengue 
virus infection confirmed by a test (also see sections 2 and 3).  
Dengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. 
How the vaccine works 
Dengvaxia stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system), to produce antibodies that will 
help protect against the viruses that cause dengue disease if the body is exposed to them in the future. 
What is dengue and dengue disease? 
Dengue is a viral infection which spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. The virus 
from an infected person can spread to other people through mosquito bites for about 4 to 5 days 
(maximum 12 days) after the first symptoms appear. Dengue is not transmitted directly from person-
to-person. 
Dengue disease results in symptoms including fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint 
pain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Symptoms usually last 
for 2 to 7 days. You can also have dengue but show no symptoms (called "asymptomatic"). 
Occasionally dengue can be severe enough for you to have to go to the hospital and in rare cases it can 
cause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal 
(belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in the stomach, 
bleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure.

2.  What you need to know before you or your child use Dengvaxia  
To make sure that Dengvaxia is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything you do 
not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. 
Do not use Dengvaxia if you or your child 
• 
Know you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Dengvaxia 
(listed in section 6). 
had an allergic reaction after using Dengvaxia before. Signs of an allergic reaction may include 
an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. 
have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). This may be due to a genetic defect 
or HIV infection. 
are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or 
chemotherapy). Your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks after you stop treatment. 
are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
•

• 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Being vaccinated without having been priorly infected by dengue virus may lead to an increased risk 
of a more serious dengue illness. This could lead to hospitalisation if you are later bitten by a dengue-
infected mosquito. 
Before the administration of Dengvaxia, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will check if you or your 
child have ever been infected by dengue virus, and will tell you if a test has to be performed. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dengvaxia if you or your child have: 
• 
a mild to high fever or acute disease. You will not get Dengvaxia until you or your child have 
recovered. 
ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. Your doctor will carefully consider the 
risks and benefits of vaccination. 
ever fainted from an injection. Fainting, and sometime falling, can occur (mostly in young 
people) following, or even before, any injection with a needle.  
had any allergic reaction to latex. The tip cap of the pre-filled syringe contains a natural rubber 
latex which may cause an allergic reaction. 
• 
• 
• 
Travellers 
Vaccination is not recommended if you have never lived in an area where dengue infections regularly 
occur and if you plan to only occasionally travel to an area where dengue infections regularly occur. 
Important information about the protection provided 
As with any vaccines, Dengvaxia may not protect everybody who has been vaccinated. You must 
continue to protect yourself against mosquito bites even after vaccination.  
After vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue 
infection, and develop any of the following symptoms: high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent 
vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, tiredness, restlessness and blood in vomit. 
Additional protection precautions 
You should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites. This includes using insect repellents, wearing 
protective clothing, and using mosquito nets. 
Younger children 
 Do not give this vaccine to children less than 6 years of age because safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia 
have not been established. 
Other medicines or vaccines and Dengvaxia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any 
other vaccines or medicines. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
• 
medicines that affect your body’s natural defences (immune system) such as high-dose 
corticosteroids or chemotherapy. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks 
after you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well. 
medicines called “immunoglobulins” or blood products containing immunoglobulins, such as 
blood or plasma. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 6 weeks, and preferably 
not for 3 months after you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well.  
• 
Dengvaxia can be given at the same time as Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis vaccine or recombinant 
Human Papillomavirus vaccines. Injections of more than one vaccine at the same time should be given 
at different injection sites. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Dengvaxia if you or your daughter are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you or your daughter:  
• 
are of child-bearing age, you must use an effective method of contraception to avoid pregnancy 
for at least one month after each Dengvaxia dose. 
think you or your daughter may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Dengvaxia. 
• 
Driving and using machines 
Dengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Dengvaxia contains phenylalanine, sodium and sorbitol 
Dengvaxia contains 41 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be 
harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
Dengvaxia contains less than 1mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
Dengvaxia contains 9.38 milligrams of sorbitol in each 0.5 ml dose. 
3. 
How to use Dengvaxia  
Previous dengue infection must be confirmed by a test, either documented in the medical history or 
performed prior to vaccination. 
Dengvaxia is given by your doctor or nurse as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in 
the upper arm. It must not be injected into a blood vessel. 
You or your child will receive 3 injections of 0.5 mL – one every 6 months. 
• 
The first injection will be given at the chosen or scheduled date. 
• 
The second injection, 6 months after the first injection. 
• 
The third injection, 6 months after the second injection. 
Dengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. 
Instructions for preparing the vaccine intended for medical and healthcare professionals are 
included at the end of the leaflet. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you or your child miss an injection of Dengvaxia 
• 
If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed 
injection. It is important that you or your child follow the instructions of your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse regarding follow-up injection.  
If you forget or are not able to go back at the schedule time, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse for advice. 
• 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, Dengvaxia can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious allergic (anaphylactic) reactions 
If any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where you or your child received an injection, 
contact a doctor immediately: 
• 
difficulty breathing 
• 
blueness of the tongue or lips 
• 
a rash 
• 
swelling of the face or throat  
• 
low blood pressure causing dizziness or fainting 
• 
sudden and serious feeling of illness or unease with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness 
and loss of consciousness, rapid heartbeat linked with breathing difficulty. 
These signs or symptoms (anaphylactic reactions) usually develop soon after the injection is given and 
while you or your child are still in the clinic or doctor’s surgery. They can also happen very rarely 
after receiving any vaccine (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
Other serious reactions  
For some people who have not been infected by dengue before vaccination, there may be an increased 
risk of getting a more serious dengue illness requiring hospitalisation if they become bitten by a 
dengue-infected mosquito later. This increased risk may mainly begin during the third year following 
the first injection.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
• 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be 
readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of 
Dengvaxia. 
Dengvaxia must not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same syringe. 
Dengvaxia must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances. 
Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous (SC) injection preferably in the upper arm 
in the region of the deltoid. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic 
response to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling 
and to manage syncopal reactions. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Reconstitution and handling of single-dose pack size  
Dengvaxia must be reconstituted prior to administration. 
Dengvaxia is reconstituted by transferring all of the solvent (0.4% sodium chloride solution) provided 
in the blue-labeled pre-filled syringe into the vial of freeze-dried powder with a yellowish green 
flip-off cap.  
1. Attach a sterile needle to the pre-filled syringe for the transfer of the solvent. The needle must 
be fitted firmly to the syringe, rotating it by a one-quarter turn. 
2. Transfer the entire content of the pre-filled syringe into the vial containing the powder. 
3. Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved. 
The suspension should be visually inspected prior to administration. After reconstitution, Dengvaxia is 
a clear, colourless liquid with the possible presence of white to translucent particles (of endogenous 
nature). 
After complete dissolution, a 0.5 mL dose of the reconstituted suspension is withdrawn into the same 
syringe. For injection, the syringe should be fitted with a new sterile needle. 
Contact with disinfectants is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine viruses. 
After reconstitution with the solvent provided, Dengvaxia must be used immediately. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Dengvaxia is and what it is used for  
Dengvaxia is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against "dengue disease" caused by 
dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. It contains versions of these 4 varieties of the virus that have 
been weakened so that they cannot cause the disease. 
Dengvaxia is given to adults, young people and children (from 6 to 45 years of age) with prior dengue 
virus infection confirmed by a test (also see sections 2 and 3).  
Dengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. 
How the vaccine works 
Dengvaxia stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system), to produces antibodies that will 
help protect against the viruses that cause dengue disease if the body is exposed to them in the future. 
What is dengue and dengue disease? 
Dengue is a viral infection which spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. The virus 
from an infected person can spread to other people through mosquito bites for about 4 to 5 days 
(maximum 12 days) after the first symptoms appear. Dengue is not transmitted directly from person-
to-person. 
Dengue disease results in symptoms including fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint 
pain, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Symptoms usually last 
for 2 to 7 days. You can also have dengue but show no symptoms (called "asymptomatic"). 
Occasionally dengue can be severe enough for you to have to go to hospital and in rare cases it can 
cause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal 
(belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in the stomach, 
bleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure.

2.  What you need to know before you or your child use Dengvaxia  
To make sure that Dengvaxia is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything you do 
not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. 
Do not use Dengvaxia if you or your child 
• 
Know you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Dengvaxia 
(listed in section 6). 
had an allergic reaction after using Dengvaxia before. Signs of an allergic reaction may include 
an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. 
have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). This may be due to a genetic defect 
or HIV infection. 
are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or 
chemotherapy). Your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks after you stop treatment. 
are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Being vaccinated without having been priorly infected by dengue virus may lead to an increased risk 
of a more serious dengue illness. This could lead to hospitalisation if you are later bitten by a dengue-
infected mosquito. 
Before the administration of Dengvaxia, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will check if you or your 
child have ever been infected by dengue virus, and will tell you if a test has to be performed. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dengvaxia if you or your child have: 
• 
a mild to high fever or acute disease. You will not get Dengvaxia until you or your child have 
recovered. 
ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. Your doctor will carefully consider the 
risks and benefits of vaccination. 
ever fainted from an injection. Fainting, and sometime falling, can occur (mostly in young 
people) following, or even before, any injection with a needle.  
• 
• 
Travellers 
Vaccination is not recommended if you have never lived in an area where dengue infections regularly 
occur and if you plan to only occasionally travel to an area where dengue infections regularly occur. 
Important information about the protection provided 
As with any vaccines, Dengvaxia may not protect everybody who has been vaccinated. You must 
continue to protect yourself against mosquito bites even after vaccination.  
After vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue 
infection, and develop any of the following symptoms: high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent 
vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, tiredness, restlessness and blood in vomit. 
Additional protection precautions 
You should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites. This includes using insect repellents, wearing 
protective clothing, and using mosquito nets. 
Younger children 
Do not give this vaccine to children less than 6 years of age because safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia 
have not been established. 
Other medicines and Dengvaxia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any 
other vaccines or medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
medicines that affect your body’s natural defences (immune system) such as high-dose 
corticosteroids or chemotherapy. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 4 weeks 
after you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well. 
medicines called “immunoglobulins” or blood products containing immunoglobulins, such as 
blood or plasma. In this case, your doctor will not use Dengvaxia until 6 weeks, and preferably 
not for 3 months after you stop treatment. This is because Dengvaxia might not work as well.  
Dengvaxia can be given at the same time as Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis vaccine or recombinant 
Human Papillomavirus vaccines. Injections of more than one vaccine at the same time should be given 
at different injection sites. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Dengvaxia if you or your daughter are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you or your daughter:  
• 
are of child-bearing age, you must use an effective method of contraception to avoid pregnancy 
for at least one month after each Dengvaxia dose. 
think you or your daughter may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Dengvaxia. 
• 
Driving and using machines 
Dengvaxia has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Dengvaxia contains phenylalanine, sodium and sorbitol 
Dengvaxia contains 8 micrograms of phenylalanine in each 0.5 ml dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful 
if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because 
the body cannot remove it properly. 
Dengvaxia  contains  less  than  1mmol  of  sodium  (23  mg)  per  0.5  ml  dose,  that  is  to  say  essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
Dengvaxia contains 1.76 milligrams of sorbitol in each 0.5 ml dose. 
3. 
How to use Dengvaxia  
Previous dengue infection must be confirmed by a test, either documented in the medical history or 
performed prior to vaccination. 
Dengvaxia is given by your doctor or nurse as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in 
the upper arm. It must not be injected into a blood vessel. 
You or your child will receive 3 injections of 0.5 mL – one every 6 months. 
• 
The first injection will be given at the chosen or scheduled date. 
• 
The second injection, 6 months after the first injection. 
• 
The third injection, 6 months after the second injection. 
Dengvaxia should be used according to official recommendations. 
Instructions for preparing the vaccine intended for medical and healthcare professionals are 
included at the end of the leaflet. 
If you or your child miss an injection of Dengvaxia 
• 
If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed 
injection. It is important that you or your child follow the instructions of your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse regarding follow-up injection.  
If you forget or are not able to go back at the schedule time, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse for advice. 
• 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, Dengvaxia can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious allergic (anaphylactic) reactions 
If any of these symptoms occur after leaving the place where you or your child received an injection, 
contact a doctor immediately: 
• 
difficulty breathing 
• 
blueness of the tongue or lips 
• 
a rash 
• 
swelling of the face or throat  
• 
low blood pressure causing dizziness or fainting 
• 
sudden and serious feeling of illness or unease with drop in blood pressure causing dizziness 
and loss of consciousness, rapid heartbeat linked with breathing difficulty. 
These signs or symptoms (anaphylactic reactions) usually develop soon after the injection is given and 
while you or your child are still in the clinic or doctor’s surgery. They can also happen very rarely 
after receiving any vaccine (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). 
Other serious reactions  
For some people who have not been infected by dengue before vaccination, there may be an increased 
risk of getting a more serious dengue illness requiring hospitalisation if they become bitten by a 
dengue-infected mosquito later. This increased risk may mainly begin during the third year following 
the first injection.

Reconstitution and handling of multidose pack size  
Dengvaxia must be reconstituted prior to administration. 
Dengvaxia is reconstituted by transferring all of the solvent (0.9% sodium chloride solution) provided 
in the 5-dose vial with a dark gray flip-off cap into the 5-dose vial of freeze-dried powder with a 
medium brown flip-off cap, using a sterile syringe and needle.  
1. Use a sterile syringe and needle for the transfer of the solvent.  
2. Transfer the entire content of the solvent vial (with a dark gray flip-off cap) into the vial 
containing the powder (medium brown flip-off cap). 
3. Swirl gently until the powder is dissolved. 
The suspension should be visually inspected prior to administration. After reconstitution, Dengvaxia is 
a clear, colourless liquid with the possible presence of white to translucent particles (of endogenous 
nature). 
After complete dissolution, a 0.5 mL dose of the reconstituted suspension is withdrawn into a sterile 
syringe. A new sterile syringe and needle should be used for withdrawal of each of the 5 doses. The 
recommended size of the needle to be used is 23G or 25G. 
Before each injection, the reconstituted suspension should be gently swirled once again. 
Contact with disinfectants is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine viruses. 
After reconstitution with the solvent provided, Dengvaxia must be used within 6 hours. 
Partially used multidose vials must be kept between 2°C and 8°C (i.e., in a refrigerator) and protected 
from light. 
Any remaining vaccine doses should be discarded at the end of the immunization session or within 6 
hours after reconstitution, whichever comes first. 
A partially used multidose vial must be discarded immediately if: 
• 
Sterile dose withdrawal has not been fully observed. 
• 
A new sterile syringe and needle were not used for reconstitution or withdrawal of each of the 
previous doses. 
There is any suspicion that the partially used vial has been contaminated. 
There is visible evidence of contamination, such as a change in appearance. 
• 
• 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH 
and FSH deficiency. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Posology 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of Pergoveris therapy is to promote follicular 
development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course of daily injections. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and 
has low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences with one vial of Pergoveris daily. If less than one vial daily is 
used, the follicular response may be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be 
insufficient (see section 5.1). 
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size 
by ultrasound and oestrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7 to 14 day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It 
may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 IU to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is 
recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be 
performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

General recommendations 
Pergoveris contains potent gonadotropic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse 
reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems 
and their management. 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
should be given. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to 
FSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be 
used in women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or 
a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, 
haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic 
events. 
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as 
pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol 
level (> 900 pg/mL or > 3 300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number 
of developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation). 
Adherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise 
the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as 
oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as 
serum oestradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is 
recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier 
contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over 
several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has 
been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, 
OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at 
least two weeks after hCG administration. 
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should 
be hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in 
patients with polycystic ovarian disease. 
When a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated 
with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian 
torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to 
reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is 
increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When 
risk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general 
population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet 
established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile 
women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity 
(body mass index > 30 kg/m²), treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk. In these 
women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be 
noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic 
events. 
Sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pergoveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same 
injection, except follitropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not 
significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the 
active substances. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of 
exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, 
embryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian 
stimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case 
of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
Pergoveris. 
Breast-feeding 
Pergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Pergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or 
moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the 
stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC 
code: G03GA30. 
Pergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, 
r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Mechanism of action 
Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and play a complementary role 
in follicle development and ovulation. In theca cells, LH stimulates the secretion of androgens that are 
transferred to granulosa cells to be converted to oestradiol (E2) by aromatase. In granulosa cells, FSH 
stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, 
steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and oestradiol levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of 
follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third 
day of r-hFSH administration, while oestradiol levels take more time and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after about 4 to 5 days of 
r-hFSH daily dosing and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 
10 days from the start of gonadotropin administration. The primary effect resulting from 
administration of r-hLH is a dose-related increase of E2 secretion, enhancing the effect of r-hFSH on 
follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 
70 to 75%. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH 
measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In one clinical study of women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH 
concentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH 
daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen 
production. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient 
follicular development. 
Therefore, administration of less than one vial of Pergoveris daily may provide too little LH-activity to 
ensure adequate follicular development. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Clinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative 
clinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the 
two formulations. 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously.

Follitropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
Lutropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of 
approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 9 to 11 hours. 
The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 5 to 14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear 
pharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 56% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 8 to 21 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 450 IU. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated 
administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is in the range of 1.7 to 1.8 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, 
haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic 
events. 
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as 
pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol 
level (> 900 pg/mL or > 3 300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number 
of developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation). 
Adherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise 
the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as 
oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as 
serum oestradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is 
recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier 
contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over 
several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has 
been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, 
OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at 
least two weeks after hCG administration. 
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should 
be hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in 
patients with polycystic ovarian disease. 
When a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated 
with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian 
torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to 
reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is 
increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When 
risk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general 
population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet 
established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile 
women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity 
(body mass index > 30 kg/m²), treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk. In these 
women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be 
noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic 
events. 
Sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen must not be administered as a mixture with other 
medicinal products in the same injection. 
Pergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen may be administered concomitantly with a licensed 
follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of 
exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, 
embryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian 
stimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case 
of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
Pergoveris. 
Breast-feeding 
Pergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Pergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or 
moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the 
stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC 
code: G03GA30. 
Pergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, 
r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Mechanism of action 
Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and play a complementary role 
in follicle development and ovulation. In theca cells, LH stimulates the secretion of androgens that are 
transferred to granulosa cells to be converted to oestradiol (E2) by aromatase. In granulosa cells, FSH 
stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, 
steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and oestradiol levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of 
follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third 
day of r-hFSH administration, while oestradiol levels take more time and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after about 4 to 5 days of 
r-hFSH daily dosing and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 
10 days from the start of gonadotropin administration. The primary effect resulting from 
administration of r-hLH is a dose-related increase of E2 secretion, enhancing the effect of r-hFSH on 
follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy  
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 
70 to 75%. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH 
measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In one clinical study of women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH 
concentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH 
daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen 
production. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient 
follicular development. 
Therefore, administration of Pergoveris containing less than 75 IU r-hLH daily may provide too little 
LH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Clinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative 
clinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the 
two formulations. 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Follitropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
Lutropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of 
approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 9 to 11 hours. 
The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 5 to 14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear 
pharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 56% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 8 to 21 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 450 IU. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated 
administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is in the range of 1.7 to 1.8 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH 
and FSH deficiency. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Posology 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of Pergoveris therapy is to promote follicular 
development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course of daily injections. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and 
has low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 150 IU 
r-hFSH/75 IU r-hLH daily. If less than the recommended dose daily is used, the follicular response 
may be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be insufficient (see section 5.1). 
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size 
by ultrasound and oestrogen response.  
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7 to 14 day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It 
may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 IU to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is 
recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be 
performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

General recommendations 
Pergoveris contains potent gonadotropic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse 
reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems 
and their management. 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
should be given. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to 
FSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be 
used in women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or 
a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, 
haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic 
events. 
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as 
pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol 
level (> 900 pg/mL or > 3 300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number 
of developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation). 
Adherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise 
the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as 
oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as 
serum oestradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is 
recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier 
contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over 
several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has 
been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, 
OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at 
least two weeks after hCG administration. 
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should 
be hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in 
patients with polycystic ovarian disease. 
When a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated 
with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian 
torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to 
reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. 
Multiple pregnancy

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC 
code: G03GA30. 
Pergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, 
r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Mechanism of action 
Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and play a complementary role 
in follicle development and ovulation. In theca cells, LH stimulates the secretion of androgens that are 
transferred to granulosa cells to be converted to oestradiol (E2) by aromatase. In granulosa cells, FSH 
stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, 
steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and oestradiol levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of 
follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third 
day of r-hFSH administration, while oestradiol levels take more time and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after about 4 to 5 days of 
r-hFSH daily dosing and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 
10 days from the start of gonadotropin administration. The primary effect resulting from 
administration of r-hLH is a dose-related increase of E2 secretion, enhancing the effect of r-hFSH on 
follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy  
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 
70 to 75%. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH 
measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In one clinical study of women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH 
concentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH 
daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen 
production. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient 
follicular development. 
Therefore, administration of Pergoveris containing less than 75 IU r-hLH daily may provide too little 
LH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Clinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative 
clinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the 
two formulations. 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Follitropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
Lutropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of 
approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 9 to 11 hours. 
The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 5 to 14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear 
pharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 56% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 8 to 21 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 450 IU. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated 
administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is in the range of 1.7 to 1.8 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH 
and FSH deficiency. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of fertility disorders. 
Posology 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of Pergoveris therapy is to promote follicular 
development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course of daily injections. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and 
has low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 150 IU 
r-hFSH/75 IU r-hLH daily. If less than the recommended dose daily is used, the follicular response 
may be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be insufficient (see section 5.1). 
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size 
by ultrasound and oestrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7 to 14 day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It 
may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 IU to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is 
recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be 
performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

General recommendations 
Pergoveris contains potent gonadotropic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse 
reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems 
and their management. 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
should be given. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to 
FSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be 
used in women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or 
a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, 
haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic 
events. 
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as 
pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol 
level (> 900 pg/mL or > 3 300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number 
of developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation). 
Adherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise 
the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as 
oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as 
serum oestradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is 
recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier 
contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over 
several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has 
been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, 
OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at 
least two weeks after hCG administration. 
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should 
be hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in 
patients with polycystic ovarian disease. 
When a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated 
with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian 
torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to 
reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is 
increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When 
risk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general 
population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet 
established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile 
women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity 
(body mass index > 30 kg/m²), treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk. In these 
women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be 
noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic 
events. 
Sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen must not be administered as a mixture with other 
medicinal products in the same injection. 
Pergoveris solution for injection in pre-filled pen may be administered concomitantly with a licensed 
follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of 
exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, 
embryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian 
stimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case 
of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of 
Pergoveris. 
Breast-feeding 
Pergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Pergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).  
Mild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of 
the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC 
code: G03GA30. 
Pergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, 
r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Mechanism of action 
Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and play a complementary role 
in follicle development and ovulation. In theca cells, LH stimulates the secretion of androgens that are 
transferred to granulosa cells to be converted to oestradiol (E2) by aromatase. In granulosa cells, FSH 
stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, 
steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and oestradiol levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of 
follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third 
day of r-hFSH administration, while oestradiol levels take more time and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after about 4 to 5 days of 
r-hFSH daily dosing and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 
10 days from the start of gonadotropin administration. The primary effect resulting from 
administration of r-hLH is a dose-related increase of E2 secretion, enhancing the effect of r-hFSH on 
follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 
70 to 75%. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH 
measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In one clinical study of women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH 
concentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH 
daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen 
production. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient 
follicular development. 
Therefore, administration of Pergoveris containing less than 75 IU r-hLH daily may provide too little 
LH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Clinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative 
clinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the 
two formulations. 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously.

Follitropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
Lutropin alfa 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of 
approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 9 to 11 hours. 
The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 5 to14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear 
pharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 56% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 8 to 21 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 450 IU. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated 
administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal. 
Elimination 
Total clearance is in the range of 1.7 to 1.8 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pergoveris is and what it is used for 
What Pergoveris is 
Pergoveris contains two different active substances called “follitropin alfa” and “lutropin alfa”. Both 
belong to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”, which are involved in reproduction and 
fertility. 
What Pergoveris is used for 
This medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your 
ovaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who have 
low levels (severe deficiency) of “follicle stimulating hormone” (FSH) and “luteinising hormone” 
(LH). These women are usually infertile. 
How Pergoveris works 
The active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body: 
• 
• 
FSH stimulates the production of eggs 
LH stimulates the release of the eggs. 
By replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to 
develop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone “human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG)”. This helps the women to become pregnant. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Pergoveris 
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility problems. 
Do not use Pergoveris 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland) 
if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin 
• 
• 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding 
if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts 
if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early 
menopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb. 
Do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris. 
Porphyria 
Talk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have 
porphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed 
to sunlight 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see in section 4. under “Most serious side effects”). 
In case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered 
to, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. 
This becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under “How much to use” for details). 
If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you 
may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four 
days. 
Your doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
tests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a 
miscarriage than the average woman. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of pregnancy 
where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the pregnancy 
is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood 
clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood 
clots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment. 
Tumours of sex organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. 
Allergic reactions 
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had 
this type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris. 
Children and adolescents 
Pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Pergoveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Do not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, if 
prescribed by your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Pergoveris contains sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use Pergoveris 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Using this medicine 
• 
Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To 
minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
It comes as a powder and liquid, which you need to mix together and then use straight away. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to prepare and inject this medicine. They will 
supervise your first injection. 
If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject 
the medicine yourself at home. When you do this, please carefully read and follow the 
instructions hereafter called “How to prepare and use the Pergoveris powder and solvent”. 
How much to use 
The usual starting dose is one vial of Pergoveris every day. 
• 
According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed 
follitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is 
usually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU. 
Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a 
suitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. 
This may take up to 5 weeks. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is on 
the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another 
medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see in section 2. under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). In this case, your doctor will 
give you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle. 
How to prepare and use the Pergoveris powder and solvent 
Before starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first: 
Give yourself the injection at the same time each day. 
1.  Wash your hands and find a clean area 
• 
• 
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible 
A good place is a clean table or kitchen surface 
2. 
Get together everything you need and lay them out 
• 
• 
1 vial containing Pergoveris powder 
1 vial containing water for injections (solvent) 
Not provided in the pack: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
2 alcohol swabs 
1 empty syringe for injection 
1 needle for preparation 
1 fine bore needle for injection under the skin 
one sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles 
3. 
Preparing the solution 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the protective cap from the vial filled with water (solvent vial). 
Attach the needle for preparation to the empty syringe for injection. 
Draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to 
approximately the 1 mL mark. 
Insert the needle into the vial, push the plunger to expel the air. 
Turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the water (solvent). 
Remove the syringe from the vial and set it down carefully. Do not 
touch the needle and do not allow the needle to touch any surface. 
Remove the protective cap from the vial filled with Pergoveris powder. 
Pick up your syringe and slowly inject the contents of the syringe into 
the vial of powder.  
Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do not shake. 
After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), 
check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any 
particles. 
Turn the vial upside down, gently draw the solution back into the 
syringe. Check for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is 
not clear.

Getting the syringe ready for injection 
5. 
Injecting the dose 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Change the needle for the fine bore needle. 
Remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the 
syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe 
until all the air collects at the top. Push the plunger until the air bubbles 
are gone. 
Immediately inject the solution. Your doctor or nurse will have already 
advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). To minimise 
skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
Clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion. 
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90  angle 
using a dart-like motion.  
Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a 
vein. 
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger. Take as much time 
as you need to inject all the solution.  
Then withdraw the needle and clean the skin with a new alcohol swab 
using a circular motion. 
6. 
After the injection 
Dispose of all used items. Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and 
empty vials in your sharps container. Any unused solution must be discarded. 
If you use more Pergoveris than you should 
The effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. 
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under “Ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use Pergoveris 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor. 
If you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Contact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor 
might ask you to stop using Pergoveris. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can 
sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the 
treatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under “Ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor 
will need to examine you as soon as possible. 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect up 
to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found 
very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. In rare cases this 
can also happen independently of OHSS (see in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems 
(thromboembolic events)”). 
• 
• 
• 
Other side effects 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) 
• 
headache 
• 
local reactions at the injection site such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation. 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
diarrhoea 
breast pain 
feeling sick or vomiting 
abdominal or pelvic pain

Possible side effects 
How to store Pergoveris 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pergoveris is and what it is used for 
What Pergoveris is 
Pergoveris contains two different active substances called “follitropin alfa” and “lutropin alfa”. Both 
belong to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”, which are involved in reproduction and 
fertility. 
What Pergoveris is used for 
This medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your 
ovaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who have 
low levels (severe deficiency) of “follicle stimulating hormone” (FSH) and “luteinising hormone” 
(LH). These women are usually infertile. 
How Pergoveris works 
The active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body: 
• 
• 
FSH stimulates the production of eggs 
LH stimulates the release of the eggs. 
By replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to 
develop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone “human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG)”. This helps the women to become pregnant. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Pergoveris 
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility problems. 
Do not use Pergoveris 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland) 
if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin 
• 
• 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding 
if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts 
if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early 
menopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb. 
Do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris. 
Porphyria 
Talk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have 
porphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed 
to sunlight 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see in section 4. under “Most serious side effects”). 
In case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered 
to, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. 
This becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under “How much to use” for details). 
If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you 
may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four 
days. 
Your doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
tests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a 
miscarriage than the average woman. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of pregnancy 
where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the pregnancy 
is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood 
clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood 
clots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment. 
Tumours of sex organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. 
Allergic reactions 
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had 
this type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris. 
Children and adolescents 
Pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Pergoveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Do not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection. You can use Pergoveris with a 
licensed follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections, if prescribed by your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Pergoveris contains sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially “sodium-free”.

Get familiar with your Pergoveris pre-filled pen 
* For illustration purposes only. 
** The numbers in the Dose Feedback Window and reservoir holder represent the number of 
International Units (IU) of medicine. 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 
minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room 
temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen. 
1.2.  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or 
countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4) 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well 
(Figure 5). 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the Pergoveris pre-filled pen from the 
pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says Pergoveris. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen if the expiration date has 
passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say Pergoveris. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and 
does not contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is 
discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an 
infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is 
set to “0” (Figure 8). 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to 
use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimize skin 
irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each 
injection. 
Re-using needles can cause infections 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” needles 
supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is 
not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not 
passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer 
needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using 
expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or 
outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a 
sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the 
Pergoveris pre-filled pen until you feel a light 
resistance (Figure 12). 
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be 
difficult to remove after the injection. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently 
(Figure 13). 
3.8  Put it aside for later use (Figure 14). 
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle 
stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the 
pre-filled pen. 
3.9  Hold the Pergoveris pre-filled pen with the needle 
pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10  Carefully remove and discard the green inner needle 
shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner needle shield, 
as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection. 
3.11  Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny 
droplet(s) of liquid. 
If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet, 
proceed to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for a 
droplet of liquid. 
Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial 
your dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18).  
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
5. 
6. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150” IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
•  Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
up (Figure 22). 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your 
healthcare provider. 
5.1  Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely 
(Figure 24). 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting 
knob.  Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it 
will go and hold it to complete the full injection 
(Figure 25). 
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject. 
5.3  Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds 
before you remove the needle from your skin 
(Figure 26). 
•  The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback 
Window will turn back to “0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out 
of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose 
setting knob. 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle 
from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1  Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface. 
6.2  Hold the Pergoveris pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3  Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4  Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5  Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figuer 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured by 
the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle. 
Step 7 After the injection 
7.1  Check you have given a complete injection 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows “0” 
(Figure 32). 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you have 
completed your dose. 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than 
“0”, the Pergoveris pre-filled pen is empty. You have not 
received your full prescribed dose and you must perform 
step 7.2 below. 
7.2  Complete a partial injection (only when needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the 
missing amount you need to inject using a new pen. 
In the example shown, the missing amount is “50” 
IU (Figure 33). 
•  To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat 
Steps 1 through 8. 
Step 8 Storethe Pergoveris pre-filled pen 
8.1  Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid 
infection (Figure 34). 
8.2  Store the pen in its original packaging in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet. 
8.3  When the pen is empty, ask you healthcare 
provider how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the Pergoveris pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged 
as this can cause injury. 
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pergoveris is and what it is used for 
What Pergoveris is 
Pergoveris contains two different active substances called “follitropin alfa” and “lutropin alfa”. Both 
belong to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”, which are involved in reproduction and 
fertility. 
What Pergoveris is used for 
This medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your 
ovaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who have 
low levels (severe deficiency) of “follicle stimulating hormone” (FSH) and “luteinising hormone” 
(LH). These women are usually infertile. 
How Pergoveris works 
The active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body: 
• 
• 
FSH stimulates the production of eggs 
LH stimulates the release of the eggs. 
By replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to 
develop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone “human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG)”. This helps the women to become pregnant. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Pergoveris 
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility problems. 
Do not use Pergoveris 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland) 
if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin 
• 
• 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding 
if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts 
if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early 
menopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb. 
Do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris. 
Porphyria 
Talk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have 
porphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed 
to sunlight 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see in section 4. under “Most serious side effects”). 
In case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered 
to, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. 
This becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under “How much to use” for details). 
If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you 
may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four 
days. 
Your doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
tests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a 
miscarriage than the average woman. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of pregnancy 
where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the pregnancy 
is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood 
clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood 
clots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment. 
Tumours of sex organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. 
Allergic reactions 
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had 
this type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris. 
Children and adolescents 
Pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Pergoveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Do not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection. You can use Pergoveris with a 
licensed follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections, if prescribed by your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Pergoveris contains sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use Pergoveris 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Using this medicine 
• 
Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To 
minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.  
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen to inject the 
medicine. 
If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject 
the medicine yourself at home. 
If you administer Pergoveris to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
Use”. 
• 
• 
• 
How much to use 
A treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 
150 International Units (IU) of follitropin alfa and 75 IU of lutropin alfa every day. 
• 
According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed 
follitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is 
usually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU. 
Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a 
suitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests.  
This may take up to 5 weeks. 
• 
• 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is on 
the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another 
medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see in section 2. under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). In this case, your doctor will 
give you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle. 
If you use more Pergoveris than you should 
The effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. 
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under “Ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use Pergoveris 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor. 
If you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Contact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor 
might ask you to stop using Pergoveris. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can 
sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the 
treatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under “Ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor 
will need to examine you as soon as possible. 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect up 
to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found 
very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. In rare cases this 
can also happen independently of OHSS (see in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems 
(thromboembolic events)”).

Get familiar with your Pergoveris pre-filled pen 
* For illustration purposes only. 
** The numbers in the Dose Feedback Window and reservoir holder represent the number of 
International Units (IU) of medicine. 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 
minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room 
temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen. 
1.2.  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or 
countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4) 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well 
(Figure 5). 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the Pergoveris pre-filled pen from the 
pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says Pergoveris. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen if the expiration date has 
passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say Pergoveris. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and 
does not contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is 
discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an 
infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is 
set to “0” (Figure 8). 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to 
use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimize skin 
irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each 
injection. 
Re-using needles can cause infections 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” needles 
supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is 
not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not 
passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer 
needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using 
expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or 
outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a 
sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the 
Pergoveris pre-filled pen until you feel a light 
resistance (Figure 12). 
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be 
difficult to remove after the injection. 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently 
(Figure 13). 
3.8  Put it aside for later use (Figure 14). 
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle 
stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the 
pre-filled pen. 
3.9  Hold the Pergoveris pre-filled pen with the needle 
pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10  Carefully remove and discard the green inner needle 
shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner needle shield, 
as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection. 
3.11  Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny 
droplet(s) of liquid. 
If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet, 
proceed to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for a 
droplet of liquid. 
Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial 
your dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18).  
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”. 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
5. 
6. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150 IU”, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
•  Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
up (Figure 22). 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your 
healthcare provider. 
5.1  Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely 
(Figure 24). 
94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting 
knob.  Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it 
will go and hold it to complete the full injection 
(Figure 25). 
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject. 
5.3  Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds 
before you remove the needle from your skin 
(Figure 26). 
•  The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback 
Window will turn back to “0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out 
of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose 
setting knob. 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle 
from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1  Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface. 
6.2  Hold the Pergoveris pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3  Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4  Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5  Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figuer 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured by 
the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle.

Step 7 After the injection 
7.1  Check you have given a complete injection 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows 
“0” (Figure 32). 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you have 
completed your dose. 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher 
than “0”, the Pergoveris pre-filled pen is empty. You 
have not received your full prescribed dose and you must 
perform step 7.2 below. 
7.2  Complete a partial injection (only when needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will indicate 
the missing amount you need to inject using a 
new pen. In the example shown, the missing 
amount is “50” IU (Figure 33). 
•  To complete the dose with a second pen, 
repeat Steps 1 through 8. 
Step 8 Store the Pergoveris pre-filled pen 
8.1 
Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid infection 
(Figure 34). 
8.2 
Store the pen in its original packaging in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet. 
8.3  When the pen is empty, ask you healthcare provider 
how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the Pergoveris pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged 
as this can cause injury. 
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

Possible side effects 
How to store Pergoveris 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pergoveris is and what it is used for 
What Pergoveris is 
Pergoveris contains two different active substances called “follitropin alfa” and “lutropin alfa”. Both 
belong to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”, which are involved in reproduction and 
fertility. 
What Pergoveris is used for 
This medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your 
ovaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who have 
low levels (severe deficiency) of “follicle stimulating hormone” (FSH) and “luteinising hormone” 
(LH). These women are usually infertile. 
How Pergoveris works 
The active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body: 
• 
• 
FSH stimulates the production of eggs 
LH stimulates the release of the eggs. 
By replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to 
develop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone “human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG)”. This helps the women to become pregnant. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Pergoveris 
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility problems. 
Do not use Pergoveris 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland) 
if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin 
• 
• 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding 
if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts 
if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early 
menopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb. 
Do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris. 
Porphyria 
Talk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have 
porphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed 
to sunlight 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see in section 4. under “Most serious side effects”). 
In case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered 
to, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. 
This becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under “How much to use” for details). 
If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you 
may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four 
days. 
Your doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
tests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a 
miscarriage than the average woman. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of pregnancy 
where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the pregnancy 
is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.

Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood 
clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood 
clots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment. 
Tumours of sex organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. 
Allergic reactions 
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had 
this type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris. 
Children and adolescents 
Pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Pergoveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Do not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection. You can use Pergoveris with a 
licensed follitropin alfa preparation as separate injections, if prescribed by your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Pergoveris contains sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use Pergoveris 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Using this medicine 
• 
Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To 
minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.  
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen to inject the 
medicine. 
If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject 
the medicine yourself at home. 
If you administer Pergoveris to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
Use”. 
• 
• 
• 
How much to use 
A treatment regimen commences with the recommended dose of Pergoveris containing 
150 International Units (IU) of follitropin alfa and 75 IU of lutropin alfa every day. 
• 
According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed 
follitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is 
usually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU. 
Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a 
suitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests.  
This may take up to 5 weeks. 
• 
• 
100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is on 
the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another 
medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see in section 2. under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). In this case, your doctor will 
give you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle. 
If you use more Pergoveris than you should 
The effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown, nevertheless one could expect OHSS to occur. 
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see in section 2. under “Ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use Pergoveris 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor. 
If you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Most serious side effects 
Contact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects. The doctor 
might ask you to stop using Pergoveris. 
Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can 
sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting. These may be the symptoms of 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the 
treatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see in section 2. under “Ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common. If this happens, your doctor 
will need to examine you as soon as possible. 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely (may affect up 
to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are found 
very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack. In rare cases this 
can also happen independently of OHSS (see in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems 
(thromboembolic events)”). 
• 
• 
• 
Other side effects 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
• 
sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) 
• 
headache 
• 
local reactions at the injection site such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation. 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
diarrhoea 
breast pain 
feeling sick or vomiting 
abdominal or pelvic pain 
abdominal cramp or bloating. 
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people): 
• 
Your asthma may get worse.

* For illustration purposes only. 
** The numbers in the Dose Feedback Window and reservoir holder represent the number of 
International Units (IU) of medicine. 
Step 1 Gather your supplies 
1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 
minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room 
temperature. 
Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen. 
1.2.  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or 
countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4) 
1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well 
(Figure 5). 
106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5  Use your hand to remove the Pergoveris pre-filled pen from 
the pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says Pergoveris. 
1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6). 
Do not use the Pergoveris pre-filled pen if the expiration date has 
passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say Pergoveris. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7). 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and 
does not contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is 
discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an 
infection. 
2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is 
set to “0” (Figure 8). 
Choose your injection site: 
2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to 
use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimize skin 
irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol 
swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin. 
Step 3 Attach your needle 
Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each 
injection.  
Re-using needles can cause infections 
3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the “single-use” needles 
supplied. 
3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged. 
3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly. 
3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is 
not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not 
passed (Figure 10). 
3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11). 
Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer 
needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using 
expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or 
outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a 
sharps container and get a new needle. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the 
Pergoveris pre-filled pen until you feel a light 
resistance (Figure 12). 
Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be 
difficult to remove after the injection. 
107 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently 
(Figure 13). 
3.8  Put it aside for later use (Figure 14). 
Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle 
stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the 
pre-filled pen. 
3.9  Hold the Pergoveris pre-filled pen with the needle 
pointing upward (Figure 15). 
3.10  Carefully remove and discard the green inner needle 
shield (Figure 16). 
Do not recap the needle with the green inner needle shield, 
as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection. 
3.11  Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny 
droplet(s) of liquid. 
If 
Using a new 
pen 
Reusing a 
pen 
Then 
Check for a droplet of liquid at 
the tip of the needle (Figure 17). 
•  If you see a tiny droplet, 
proceed to Step 4 Dial your 
dose. 
•  If you do not see a tiny 
droplet at or near the needle 
tip, you must perform the 
steps on the next page to 
remove air in the system. 
It is NOT required to check for a 
droplet of liquid. 
Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial 
your dose. 
If you do not see a tiny droplet(s) of liquid at or near the tip the first time you use a new pen: 
1. 
Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads “25” in the Dose Feedback Window 
(Figure 18). 
•  You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past “25”. 
108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward. 
Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19). 
Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go. A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of 
the needle (Figure 20). 
Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads “0” (Figure 21). 
Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. 
5. 
6. 
If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider. 
Step 4 Dial your dose 
4.1  Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window. 
•  Example: If your intended dose is “150 IU”, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads 
“150” (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment. 
•  Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial 
•  You can turn the dose setting knob 
up (Figure 22). 
backwards if you turn it past your intended 
dose (Figure 23). 
4.2  Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you 
move on to the next step. 
Step 5 Inject your dose 
Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your 
healthcare provider. 
5.1  Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely 
(Figure 24). 
109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting 
knob. 
Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it will go 
and hold it to complete the full injection (Figure 25). 
Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject. 
5.3  Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds 
before you remove the needle from your skin 
(Figure 26). 
•  The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback 
Window will turn back to “0”. 
•  After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out 
of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob 
pressed down (Figure 27). 
•  When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose 
setting knob. 
Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle 
from the skin. 
Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection 
6.1  Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface. 
6.2  Hold the Pergoveris pre-filled pen firmly 
with one hand and slip the needle into the 
outer needle cap (Figure 28). 
6.3  Continue by pushing the capped needle 
against a firm surface until you hear a 
“click” (Figure 29). 
6.4  Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the 
needle by turning it in the opposite 
direction (Figure 30). 
6.5  Dispose of the used needle safely in a 
sharps container (Figuer 31). Handle the 
needle with care to avoid getting injured by 
the needle. 
Do not reuse or share any used needle.

Step 7 After the injection 
7.1  Check you have given a complete injection 
•  Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows “0” 
(Figure 32). 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows “0”, you have 
completed your dose. 
If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher 
than “0”, the Pergoveris pre-filled pen is empty. You 
have not received your full prescribed dose and you must 
perform step 7.2 below. 
7.2  Complete a partial injection (only when needed): 
•  The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the 
missing amount you need to inject using a new 
pen. In the example shown, the missing amount 
is “50” IU (Figure 33). 
•  To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat 
Steps 1 through 8. 
Step 8 Storethe Pergoveris pre-filled pen 
8.1 
Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid infection 
(Figure 34). 
8.2 
Store the pen in its original packaging in a safe 
place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet. 
8.3  When the pen is empty, ask you healthcare provider 
how to dispose of it. 
Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection. 
Do not reuse the Pergoveris pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged as 
this can cause injury. 
Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Melanoma 
Melanoma is a malignant tumour that originates from melanocytic cells and primarily involves the skin. 
Melanoma is potentially the most dangerous form of skin tumour and causes 90% of skin cancer 
mortality1. 
The incidence of malignant melanoma in the EU varies from 3 to 5/100,000/year in Mediterranean 
countries to 12-12 in Nordic countries2. The incidence of melanoma is increasing worldwide in white 
populations, 3 . 
About 90% of melanomas are diagnosed as primary tumours without any evidence of metastasis. The 
10-year survival for early stage melanoma is 75-85%. The most important histological prognostic 
factors for primary melanoma without metastases are vertical tumour thickness (Breslow’s depth), 
presence of ulceration, mitotic rate and level of invasion (Clark’s level). Moreover, prognosis is poorer 
when patients are older or male and when the tumour is located on the trunk, head and neck tumours 
compared to melanomas on the limbs. 
Melanomas can metastasise either by the lymphatic or the haematogenous route. About two-thirds of 
metastases are originally confined to the drainage area of regional lymph nodes. A regional metastasis 
can appear as satellite metastases (up to 2 cm from the primary tumour), in-transit metastases 
(located in the skin between 2 cm from the site of the primary tumour and the first draining lymph 
node), micrometastasis in the regional lymph nodes (identified via sentinel lymph node biopsy) and 
clinically recognisable regional lymph node metastases.  
The 10-year survival is 30-50% for patients with satellite and in-transit metastases, 30-70% for 
patients with lymph node micrometastases and 20-40% for those with clinically apparent regional 
lymph node metastases. With distant metastases, prognosis is poor with a median survival in 
untreated patients of 6-9 months. 
Staging is based upon the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system, which was recently 
updated to the eighth edition. Key changes in the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual include: 
−  Tumor thickness measurements to be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm, not 0.01 mm; 
−  Definitions of T1a and T1b are revised (T1a, <0.8 mm without ulceration; T1b, 0.8-1.0 mm with or 
without ulceration or <0.8 mm with ulceration), with mitotic rate no longer a T category criterion; 
−  Pathological (but not clinical) stage IA is revised to include T1b N0 M0 (formerly pathologic stage 
IB); 
−  The  N  category  descriptors  “microscopic”  and  “macroscopic”  for  regional  node  metastasis  are 
redefined as “clinically occult” and “clinically apparent”;

−  Prognostic  stage  III  groupings  are  based  on  N  category  criteria  and  T  category  criteria  (i.e., 
primary  tumor  thickness  and  ulceration)  and  increased  from  3  to  4  subgroups  (stages  IIIA-IIID; 
see also Figure 1); 
−  Definitions  of  N  subcategories  are  revised,  with  the  presence  of  microsatellites,  satellites,  or  in-
transit  metastases  now  categorized  as  N1c,  N2c,  or  N3c  based  on  the  number  of  tumor-involved 
regional lymph nodes, if any; 
−  Descriptors  are  added to each  M1  subcategory  designation  for lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH) level 
(LDH elevation no longer upstages to M1c); 
−  A new M1d designation is added for central nervous system metastases4. 
With  the  new  prognostic  staging  in  stage  3  (Figure  1),  the  5-year  melanoma-specific  survival  rate 
ranges from 93% in stage IIIA to 32% in stage IIID. In the 7th edition, the 5-year melanoma-specific 
survival rates for patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC were 78%, 59%, and 40%, respectively.

BRAF pathway in melanoma 
In melanoma, different activating mutations have been described, mainly resulting in an increased 
signalling of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)-pathway leading to cell proliferation. About 
45% of patients with cutaneous melanoma carry an activating BRAF V600 mutation, for which several 
highly selective inhibitors have been developed in the metastatic setting. Development of secondary 
resistance to BRAF-inhibitors is a frequent event and hence, the combination with MEK inhibitors 
significantly increase objective response rate, progression-free and OS compared to single agent 
BRAF-inhibitory monotherapy. Therefore, the combination of BRAF and MEK-inhibition is the current 
standard in the treatment of patients with BRAF mutations,. 
Dabrafenib and trametinib are BRAF and MEK-inhibitors currently used to treat cutaneous metastatic 
melanoma. Dabrafenib is a potent reversible ATP-competitor and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase 
activity. Trametinib is a reversible and highly selective allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1 and MEK2) activation and kinase activity. Recent 3-year 
efficacy data in the metastatic setting were published of the double-blind, phase 3 study enrolling 
previously untreated patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma. 
Patients were randomised to receive dabrafenib and trametinib or dabrafenib plus placebo. At 3 years 
PFS was 22% in the combination and 12% in the monotherapy arm. 3-year OS rates were 44% versus 
32%, respectively5. 
Current adjuvant treatments for localised Stage III and Stage IV resectable melanoma 
Surgery  is  still  the  cornerstone  of  treatment  for  patients  with  stage  I-IIIB  melanoma.  Also  for 
locoregional advanced melanomas, surgery alone is standard of care, including resection of satellite or 
in-transit  metastases  and  regional  lymph  node  dissections  once  tumour-positive  nodes  have  been 
detected. However, prognosis for patients with high risk melanoma remains poor with 5-year survival 
rates of 40 to 80%3 . Therefore, there is a need for additional adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy can 
be  offered  to  patients  without  evidence  of  macroscopic  metastases  but  at  high  risk  of  having 
microscopic metastases1.  
Chemotherapy 
A  number  of  controlled  trials  with  adjuvant  chemotherapy  in  stage  II  and  III  patients  did  not 
demonstrate  any  therapeutic  advantage.  There  is  as  yet  no  indication  for  adjuvant  systemic 
chemotherapy for melanoma outside the context of controlled studies1. 
Interferon alpha 
Interferon alpha is currently approved in both US and EU for the treatment of stage III melanoma after 
surgery. It is however not universally used. High-dose interferon alfa-2b was approved more than 20 
years  ago  and  has  been  extensively  studied.  Overall,  high-dose  interferon  has  shown  a  consistent 
benefit  with  respect  to  relapse  (hazard  ratios,  0.61  to  0.78).  Patients  who  received  pegylated 
interferon  alfa  had  an  improvement  in  recurrence-free  survival  versus  observation,  but  no  benefit  in 
overall  survival.  High-dose  interferon  has  been  associated  with  substantial  toxic  effects,  including 
fatigue,  depression,  and  flulike  symptoms.  The  majority  of  patients  who  have  received  high-dose 
interferon have not completed 1 year of therapy, and the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events has 
been more than 65%6 .

Efficacy  of  interferon  alfa  in  BRAF-mutated  melanoma  is  unclear.  There  is  preclinical  evidence  that 
BRAF  mutant  melanoma  is  associated  with  interferon  alpha  receptor  1  (IFNAR1)  downregulation 
leading to decreased sensitivity to antitumor effects of IFN alpha 7. 
Ipilimumab 
In the US adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab is registered based on the results of the EORTC 18071 
trial. This was a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding 
lymph node metastasis ≤ 1 mm or in-transit metastasis) with adequate resection of lymph nodes who 
had not received previous systemic therapy for melanoma. Patients were randomised between 10 
mg/kg ipilimumab (n=475) or placebo (n=476) up to 3 years. The primary endpoint was recurrence-
free survival (RFS). At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, RFS was 27.6 months in the ipilimumab group 
versus 17.1 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.76; 95%CI 0.64-0.89; p<0.001). The 
rate of overall survival at 5 years was 65.4% and 54.4% in ipilimumab and the placebo group, 
respectively (median OS unreliable or not reached; HR 0.72; 95%CI 0.58-0.88; p=0.001). Adverse 
events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 54.1% of the patients treated with ipilimumab group and in 26.2% 
of those in the placebo group. The most common grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events in the 
ipilimumab group were gastrointestinal (16%), hepatic (11%), and endocrine (8%). Adverse events 
led to discontinuation of treatment in 52% of the patients treated with ipilimumab and treatment-
related deaths were observed (Eggermont Lancet Oncol 2015; Eggermont NEJM 2016). Summarising, 
although ipilimumab significantly increased RFS, this was accompanied by serious toxicities. In the EU 
ipilimumab is not approved for adjuvant melanoma. 
Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to the 
programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. It has been 
recently approved for the treatment of adjuvant melanoma in the EU and its approval was based on a 
randomised phase III study comparing nivolumab vs ipilimumab. The median recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) was 37.7% in the nivolumab arm compared to 48.8 in the ipilimumab arm, with a HR=0.66 
(95%CI 0.54, 0.81, p-value <0.0001). The RFS rate at 24 months was 62.6% (95%CI 57.9, 67.0) 
compared to 50.2% (95%CI 45.3, 54.8) for nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively. Also, DMFS was 
found to be improved in the nivolumab arm with an unstratified HR of 0.76 (96%CI 0.59, 0.98; 
stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0340). The median OS was not reached but a descriptive OS analysis 
showed a 12-month OS rate of 96% and a 24-month OS rate of 89% for both nivolumab and 
ipilimumab.  
Developments in adjuvant treatment landscape for melanoma 
Currently, many studies are ongoing investigating adjuvant therapy and melanoma. In the previously 
described ipilimumab trial, the higher 10 mg/kg dose was used. In the ongoing ECOG 1609/NCT 
01274338 high-dose interferon treatment is compared with 1 year of treatment with ipilimumab at 
either 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg. Preliminary results show that 10 mg/kg ipilimumab leads to more toxicity 
than 3 mg/kg, but an unplanned RFS analysis showed no difference in RFS8 . 
Also other immunotherapies are being studies, such as pembrolizumab versus placebo in KEYNOTE-

Lastly, vemurafenib alone, a BRAF-inhibitor, is studied in the BRIM8 trial. An abstract at ESMO showed 
an advantage of adjuvant vemurafenib compared to placebo at the primary endpoint DFS in stage IIIC 
disease. Overall survival could not be determined yet, and further follow-up will follow9. 
About the product 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
• 
Trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adult 
patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
•  Dabrafenib  in  combination  with  trametinib  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adult 
patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
The agreed indication is as follows: 
• 
Trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adult 
patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
•  Dabrafenib  in  combination  with  trametinib  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  adult 
patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
Regulatory background dabrafenib and trametinib 
The current application concerns the combination adjuvant treatment with trametinib and dabrafenib of 
adult patients with stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. 
Dabrafenib and trametinb are approved in the European Union (EU) and other countries under the 
brand names of Tafinlar and Mekinist, respectively, as monotherapies and in combination for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation and 
for the treatment of adults patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600 
mutation. 
2.1.1.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.1.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dabrafenib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of B-Raf (BRAF) protein with potential antineoplastic 
activity. Trametinib is an orally bioavailable, reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-
activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. Regarding ERA, the data submitted 
was in general the same as assessed during the initial MAA for both products. With the extended 
indication it is the view of the CHMP that neither dabrafenib nor trametinib are expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
In the case of trametinib, the PEC was below the trigger value of 0. 01 μg/L and a Phase II 
assessment was not required. Moreover, trametinib has an octanol-water partition coefficient of 4.04, 
remaining below the trigger value of 4.5 for a PBT screening. In spite of remaining below the trigger 
value for a Phase II assessment, a chronic toxicity dataset was submitted.  For dabrafenib the

The  Phase  II  Tier  A  risk  assessment  suggests  no  risk  for  surface  waters,  groundwater  and 
microorganisms  in  sewage  treatment  plant  activated  sludge,  with  the  highest  risk  ratio  of  0.00054 
found for surface water. Adsorption potential of dabrafenib observed in batch equilibrium studies with 
sludge remained well below the trigger level for a terrestrial assessment. The study on transformation 
in  a  water-sediment  study  showed  significant  shifting  of  dabrafenib  into  sediment  compartments 
therefore  leading  to  a  Tier  B  risk  assessment  for  sediments.  Moreover,  the  octanol-water  partition 
coefficients  for  dabrafenib  of  3.384  and  3.229  at  pH  7  and  pH  5,  respectively,  trigger  a 
bioaccumulation study in Phase II-Tier B of the current risk assessment. 
The measured octanol-water partition coefficient (log Dow @pH 7 = 3.384) of dabrafenib is above 3.0 
indicating  that  dabrafenib  could  have  a  tendency  to  sorb  to  lipid  surfaces  and  therefore  could 
bioaccumulate  in  the  tissues  of  aquatic  organisms.  The  steady  state  bioconcentration  factors  (BCFss) 
at  the  end  of  the  uptake  phase  for  the  0.01  mg/L  concentrations  were  0.836,  9.90  and  4.38, 
respectively,  for  edible,  non-edible  and  whole  fish  tissue  and  for  the  0.1  mg/L  concentration  0.779, 
8.89  and  3.98,  respectively,  for  edible,  non-edible  and  whole  fish  tissue.  A  depuration  phase  was 
conducted and the results demonstrate that the radioactivity was rapidly cleared from the fish tissues 
when the fish were transferred to clean water.  
2.1.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  general,  the  data  submitted  for  the  ERA  is  acceptable.  It  can  be  concluded  that  dabrafenib  has 
limited bioaccumulation potential (BCF < 10).    
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 14/97 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack on non-clinical data is acceptable as the indication relates to the same disease as the 
approved indication. In general, the data submitted for the ERA is acceptable. The updated data 
submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to 
the use of dabrafenib and trametinib. Considering the above data, dabrafenib and trametinib should be 
used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the 
environment. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To  support  the  extension  the  company  conducted  one  additional  study  BRF115532.  In  this  study 
patients  have  been  treated  with  dabrafenib  150  mg  twice  daily  in  combination  with  trametinib  2  mg 
once  daily  for  a  duration  of  12  months.  The  clinical  dose  and  schedule  for  adjuvant  treatment  of 
melanoma  were  based  on  the  currently  approved  regimen  for  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma 
with  BRAF  V600  mutation.  The  commercial  formulations  are  50  mg  and  75  mg  strength  dabrafenib 
capsules and 0.5 mg and 2 mg strength trametinib tablets have been used in Study BRF115532. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology characteristics of dabrafenib and trametinib when administered as 
monotherapy, as well as the clinical pharmacology characteristics of dabrafenib and trametinib 
administered in combination have been well characterized and have been described previously in the 
monotherapy applications for the two products (EMEA/H/C/2604 and EMEA/H/C/2643).

Pharmacokinetics of concomitant dabrafenib and trametinib  
In Study BRF115532 a total of 870 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
dabrafenib 150 mg bid plus trametinib 2 mg once daily or two matching placebos for 12 months. Blood 
samples for PK analyses of dabrafenib, its metabolites hydroxy-dabrafenib (GSK2285403, M7) and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib (GSK2167542, M8), and trametinib. Samples were to be collected in a subset of 
approximately 100 subjects while on treatment using a sparse sampling approach and analysed using  
previously validated bioanalytical methods. 
PK samples (n=316, to be used both for dabrafenib and trametinib analysis) were originally available 
from 100 subjects treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in study BRF115532.  
Finally evaluable dabrafenib PK concentrations (n=73) were available from 40 subjects, and evaluable 
trametinib PK concentrations (n=81) were available from 42 subjects, after exclusion of samples that 
exceeded the stability period of 657 days and the samples without complete corresponding dosing and 
PK collection dates and times.  
For these PK samples the collection time windows to distinguish the pre-dose concentrations were then 
applied and these concentrations (yielding n=45 for dabrafenib, n=68 for trametinib) are summarized 
(Table 2 and Table 4). 
Dabrafenib 
Compared to the other PK visits, the most evaluable PK data were available for month 12. Median pre-
dose concentration of dabrafenib at this time point was 76.3 ng/mL (Table 2).  
Table 2:

received adjuvant treatment of melanoma 
Dabrafenib median PK parameters obtained in combination with trametinib in melanoma subjects 
treated in the adjuvant setting (study BRF115532) were generally consistent with parameters obtained 
in subjects with metastatic melanoma as summarised in Table 3 and Figure 2.

2.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics and PK/PD relationship  
No new pharmacodynamic data for dabrafenib and trametinib have been collected in Study 
BRF115532. Due to limited evaluable PK data, exposure-response analyses were also not conducted.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology characteristics of dabrafenib and trametinib when administered as 
monotherapy, as well as when administered in combination have been well characterized and have 
been described previously in the monotherapy applications for the two drugs (EMEA/H/C/2604 and 
EMEA/H/C/2643).  
When given in combination in Study BRF115532, the applied dose of the combination is 150 mg twice-
daily (BID) of dabrafenib with 2 mg once-daily of trametinib, administered under fasting conditions. 
These doses in combination are equal to the doses applied for the individual drugs dabrafenib and 
trametinib when given as monotherapy and have been used in other studies applying combination 
treatment.  
Dabrafenib as well as trametinib median PK parameters obtained in combination with trametinib in 
melanoma subjects treated in the adjuvant setting were generally consistent with parameters obtained 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 18/97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in subjects with metastatic melanoma. The provided analysis, comparing exposure in the adjuvant 
setting with those in metastatic melanoma setting, is considered sufficient. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK data submitted on dabrafenib and trametinib are considered adequate to characterise 
the clinical pharmacology in patients with adjuvant melanoma. The exposure of dabrafenib and 
trametinib in the adjuvant melanoma setting, with dabrafenib given at a dose of 150 mg twice daily 
and trametinib as 2 mg once daily, is considered comparable to that in the metastatic melanoma 
setting. Therefore, no changes to section 5.2 of the SmPC are considered necessary.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was RFS, which was defined as the time from 
randomisation to disease recurrence or death from any cause. The following were considered as RFS 
events: 
- 
- 
Types of recurrence considered as an event included loco-regional, distant metastases, and 
new primary melanoma; 
Any death occurring without prior documentation of tumor recurrence was considered as an 
event (and not censored in the statistical analysis). 
The following efficacy assessments were performed: 
-  Diagnostic quality, contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen 
and pelvis was performed at baseline and every 3 months during the treatment period. During 
the follow-up period a CT scan was performed every 3 months up to month 24 and every 6 
months thereafter. Intravenous contrast was used for the CT scans; preferably with oral 
contrast as well. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be used instead of a chest CT scan 
under specific circumstances. The method of imaging was to be consistent throughout the 
study. 
- 
A baseline MRI of the brain was required for all patients. CT could be performed only if MRI 
was contraindicated or unavailable. Subsequent brain scans were performed as clinically 
indicated. 
- 
Biopsy of suspected recurrences could be performed, both to confirm the diagnosis and to 
obtain tissue for exploratory analyses. 
Patients with no event by the time of the analysis cut -off were censored at the date of the last efficacy 
assessment (i.e., either radiological or non-radiological) prior to the analysis cut-off. Patients lost to 
follow-up prior to disease recurrence were censored. 
Patients who started subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to disease recurrence were censored at the 
date of last efficacy assessment (either radiological or non-radiological) before the initiation of 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Patients for whom an event occurred after a period of extended lost-
to-follow-up were censored as per the rules described in the analysis plan. 
Malignancies (including any new primary cancer from another histology, non-melanoma skin cancers 
including squamous cell carcinoma, or keratoacanthoma or basal cell carcinoma), excluding new 
primary melanomas, were not considered as melanoma recurrence events. Instead, these treatment-
emergent malignancies, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma, were required to be reported as an 
SAE. Tumour tissue samples of any new primary cancers (including melanoma) were submitted for 
biomarker characterization. The analysis of RFS was based on the ITT population. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
-  OS, the key secondary endpoint, was defined as the interval from randomization to the date of 
death, irrespective of the cause of death. 
-  DMFS was defined as the interval from randomization to the date of first distant metastasis or 
date of death, whichever occurred first. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 23/97 
 
 
 
- 
FFR was defined as the interval from randomization to local or distant recurrence with 
censoring of patients dying from causes other than melanoma or treatment-related toxicity at 
the date of death. 
Safety assessments 
Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording potential adverse effects of the treatment using the 
CTCAE version 4.0, including the relationship to the study treatment, at each study visit.  
Assessment of health outcomes 
Patients in both treatment groups completed the EQ-5D at baseline and at various time points 
throughout the study. Changes in HRQOL from baseline were assessed and compared between 
treatment groups using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. 
Sample size 
As per the initial protocol design (i.e., before protocol amendment 7), the following assumptions were 
made in the estimation of the required sample size: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Exponential survival distributions 
An HR of 0.7143 (median RFS times of 15 and 21 months in the placebo arm and the 
combination therapy arm, respectively) 
A 1:1 randomization scheme 
An overall 5%, two-sided risk of erroneously claiming superiority of the combination therapy in 
the presence of no true underlying difference (i.e., overall type I error); 
A 95% chance of successfully claiming superiority of the combination therapy in the presence 
of a true underlying difference (i.e., power or 1-type II error) 
An accrual rate of 42 patients per month over 20.3 months; and 
A dropout rate of 5% for the placebo group and 15% for the combination group. 
To enable the observation of 467 total events, an estimated total of 852 patients (i.e., approximately 
426 patients in each of the arms) would need to be enrolled, leading to implementation of final 
analyses at approximately 32 months after the start of the study (Table 7). 
Table 7: 
Statistical power scenario for RFS analysis 
As per protocol amendment 7, the final primary RFS analysis was to be performed at the predefined 
cut-off date of 30-Jun-2017, by which time it was expected that approximately 410 RFS events would 
have accrued, which would provide more than 90% power to detect the originally targeted HR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 24/97 
 
 
 
 
The final OS analysis was to be performed when approximately 597 deaths are observed which would 
provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.793 (corresponding to median OS times of 48 and 
60.5 months in the placebo and the combination arm, respectively). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation  was  done  centrally  using  a  randomisation  schedule  which  assigned  patients  in  a  1:1 
ratio  to  dabrafenib  (150  mg  bid)  and  trametinib  (2  mg  once  daily)  combination  therapy  or  two 
matched  placebos.  The  following  information  for  stratification  was  entered  into  the  interactive  voice 
response system (IVRS) system in order to obtain stratified, random, blinded, treatment assignment: 
-  Mutation type (V600E or V600K) 
-  Disease stage (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC) 
Blinding (masking) 
Study treatment was double-blinded.  
Statistical methods 
Data analysis 
Before protocol amendment 7 was issued, the original study design had 95.3% power to detect an RFS 
HR of 0.71 (corresponding to a median RFS of 15 and 21 months in the placebo arm and the 
combination therapy arm, respectively) requiring a total of 467 RFS events (relapses or deaths) with 
an overall two-sided Type I error at 5%. The study was intentionally overpowered for RFS to provide 
adequate sample size to support the statistical assumptions on OS as the key secondary endpoint. Due 
to a lower than projected rate of RFS events and a duration of median follow-up considered adequate 
in this indication, in agreement with the FDA and EMA, the protocol was amended (version 7) in May 
2017. With this amendment, a new data cut-off of 30-Jun-2017 for the primary analysis of RFS was 
planned; approximately 410 RFS events were expected to occur which would still provide sufficient 
power (92%) to detect the originally targeted HR=0.71. This cut-off (30-Jun-2017) corresponds to 
approximately 2.5 years after Last patient First dose, with a median study follow up time of 
approximately 3.3 years. 
Analysis sets 
- 
The Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) consisted of all randomized patients whether or not 
randomized treatment was administered. This population was based on the treatment to which 
the patient was randomised and was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data. 
Any patient who received a treatment randomisation number was considered to have been 
randomised. 
- 
The Safety Population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of randomised 
treatment and was based on the actual treatment received. This population was used for the 
analysis of clinical safety data. 
- 
The Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population consisted of all patients included in the Safety 
population for whom a PK sample was obtained and analysed. 
Examination of subgroups 
The following subgroups were explored in the analysis of RFS and OS: 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 25/97 
 
 
 
-  Mutation status: BRAF V600K/E positive 
-  Disease stage: IIIA/IIIB/IIIC 
-  Gender: Male/Female 
- 
Age at screening: < 65 years/≥ 65 years 
-  Race: White/Asian/Other 
-  Region: North America: USA and Canada/Europe and Israel/Asia/Pac excluding Australia and 
New Zealand/South America/Australia and New Zealand 
-  Nodal metastatic mass (micrometastasis/macrometastasis) 
-  Nodal metastatic mass and primary tumor ulceration (micrometastasis and 
ulceration/micrometastasis and no ulceration/macrometastasis and ulceration/macrometastasis 
and no ulceration) 
Pike hazard ratios with corresponding 95%CI were calculated within each of the above defined 
subgroups and results were presented in a forest plot. The analyses performed within subgroups were 
non-stratified. 
In addition, the treatment effect was investigated in the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB/IIIC, 
which has been a priori identified as a subgroup of primary interest. The RFS analysis within this 
subgroup included the Pike estimator as well as a multivariate Cox regression analysis to adjust for 
important prognostic factors. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy variable 
The study was designed to provide evidence with respect to RFS to either support the null hypothesis, 
H0: λ = 1 or reject it in favour of the alternative hypothesis, HA: λ ≠ 1, where λ is the hazard ratio 
(HR) of combination therapy relative to placebo. 
Primary analysis for RFS 
RFS was summarised using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates and compared between treatment arms 
using a stratified log-rank test (using randomization stratification factors). The Pike estimator (Berry et 
al, 1991) HR was provided, together with a 95%CI.  
Median times to RFS with first and third quartiles were presented, along with 95%CI, based on the 
Brookmeyer-Crowley method with linear transformation function. 
The primary analysis was stratified based on the classification reported at the time of randomisation 
(IVRS system) using the following two stratification factors: 
-  Mutation type (V600E, V600K) 
-  Disease stage (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC) 
This represents a total of six sub-strata. Patients in each sub-stratum were centrally randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either 150 mg twice daily of dabrafenib + 2.0 mg daily of trametinib or matching 
placebos.

Table 8: 
Assignment of events and censoring dates for RFS analysis 
Sensitivity and supportive analysis for RFS 
The following sensitivity and supportive analyses using the ITT population were conducted in order to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis: 
-  RFS regardless of start of new anticancer therapy and extended lost to follow-up: Patients who 
relapsed or died any time during treatment or follow up were considered as an event 
regardless of whether the event occurred after extended loss to follow up or after initiation of a 
new anti-cancer therapy. 
-  RFS analysis ignoring new melanoma as an event: RFS was analysed as for the primary 
analysis with the exception that relapse due to new melanoma were not considered as events. 
-  Cox regression analysis of RFS: A stratified Cox regression model was used to estimate the HR 
of RFS, along with 95%CI based on the Wald test. The exact method was used to handle the 
situation where there were ties in the event times. 
-  Cox regression with prognostic factors as covariates: Multivariate cox regression model 
stratified by randomization stratification and adjusted for the key baseline prognostic factors 
was fitted with treatment and the following baseline factors as covariates: 
o  Gender 
o  T stage (1, 2, 3, 4) 
o  Tumour ulceration (Y, N) 
o  N stage (N1, N2, N3) 
o 
In-transit disease (Y, N) 
o  Melanoma subtype (superficial spreading, nodular, other)

Analysis using stratification from the eCRF: In this sensitivity analysis the primary efficacy 
analysis was repeated using strata from the electronic eCRF rather than the classification from 
the IVRS system. Actual disease stage (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC) was derived based on the primary 
tumour (T) stage, regional lymph nodes (N) stage and distant metastasis (M) stage using data 
from the eCRF. 
Percentages of disease free patients: Time point estimates 
The percentage of surviving patients who were disease free at 1-year intervals from the time of 
randomization were estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary analysis of RFS. This 
included the following time points: 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years. Approximate 95%CI were calculated, 
based on Greenwood's formula for the standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy variables 
Overall survival 
OS was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and treatment comparisons, when performed, were 
made using a stratified log-rank test (based on the randomization stratification factors). Censoring was 
performed using the date of last known contact for those who were alive at the time of analysis. The 
Pike-based HR along with 95%CI were provided. 
The assessment of OS was based on a 3-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with two interim 
analyses and a final analysis. The first interim analysis of OS was to be performed at the time of the 
primary analysis of RFS. Per Protocol Amendment 7, an additional OS interim analysis is planned for 
when approximately 299 death events have occurred ; i.e., at 50% information fraction of the 
originally targeted 597 OS events in order to provide early efficacy information on survival, since the 
final OS analysis will occur much later. The final OS analysis is planned to be performed when 70% of 
the total number of randomized patients have died (i.e. at approximately 597 deaths). The thresholds 
for statistical significance were to be determined based on the observed information fraction and pre-
defined O’Brien-Fleming type of stopping boundary. 
A hierarchical approach was chosen to control for the overall type-I error rate for testing of multiple 
endpoints. Therefore, OS was to be formally statistically tested only if the primary efficacy endpoint 
RFS was statistically significant. 
The first potential time point for OS analysis would be at the time of the primary RFS analysis: 
- 
If RFS is significant, the first interim analysis for OS would be performed: 
1.  If  OS  is  not  significant  at  this  stage,  based  on  O’Brien-Fleming,  a  second  interim  OS 
analysis  will  be  performed  when  approximately  299  randomized  patients  have  died  (50% 
information  fraction  of  final  OS  analysis),  and  the  final  OS  analysis  would  be  performed 
when 70% of the total number of randomized patients have died (i.e. 597deaths). 
2.  If  OS  is  significant  at  the  first  interim  analysis,  no  further  formal  OS  analysis  would  be 
performed. 
- 
If RFS is not significant, OS would not be formally statistically tested. 
The percentage of surviving patients at 1-year intervals from the time of randomization was estimated 
from the Kaplan-Meier curves for OS for the ITT population. This included the following time points: 1 
year, 2 years, and 3 years. Approximate 95%CI were calculated, based on Greenwood's formula for 
the standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. 
The multivariate Cox regression analysis described above for the RFS analysis was repeated for the OS 
analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 28/97 
 
 
 
Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) 
DMFS was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and treatment comparisons were made using a 
stratified log-rank test. The first appearance of distant metastasis or all-cause mortality were used as 
events. Censoring was performed using the date of the last assessment for those who were alive 
without distant metastasis at the time of analysis. The Pike HR with 95%CI was provided. 
Freedom from relapse (FFR) 
FFR was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and treatment comparisons were made using a 
stratified log-rank test. The first appearance of local/distant metastasis or mortality due to disease 
recurrence or toxicity were used as events. Censoring was performed using the date of last 
assessment for those who were alive without local/distant metastasis or new primary melanoma at the 
time of analysis. FFR was censored if patients died from causes other than melanoma or treatment-
related toxicity at the date of death. The Pike HR with 95%CI was provided. 
Time to assessment 
For the RFS analysis described above, a box-and-whisker plot of the assessment intervals was 
provided to compare the timing of disease assessments between arms to assess potential imbalance 
between treatment arms. 
Analysis of safety 
The Safety set was used for presentation of safety data. Adverse events, SAEs, deaths, laboratory 
data, vital signs, ECG, and questionnaire data (EQ-5D) were assigned to assessment windows as 
defined below: 
-  Pre-therapy is defined as the time prior to the patient’s first dose of study treatment. 
-  On-therapy is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the date of the last 
dose of study treatment + 30 days. 
-  Post-therapy is defined as any time beyond the on-therapy period. 
Analysis of exploratory variables 
Health outcomes 
Analyses were based on the ITT population. Results for the EQ 5D were summarized using descriptive 
statistics at each assessment time for which there are adequate data. Summary statistics on change 
from baseline were also provided. Changes of mean scores over time were analysed with a repeated 
measures analysis of covariance model using mixed effects and baseline score as covariate for both EQ 
-5D Thermometer and Utility scores. Differences between treatment groups along with 95%CI and p-
values were displayed. Patient listings of EQ-5D categories, Utility Scores, and Thermometer values 
were produced. 
Handling of missing values 
All randomized patients were included in the efficacy analyses as per the ITT principle, and all events 
during the study were considered (as per conventions described above) regardless of whether they 
occurred on treatment or after treatment discontinuation. The conventions for censoring of patients for 
whom a RFS event occurred after extended lost-to-follow up (i.e., after period with missing data) are 
described in the analysis plan. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 29/97 
 
 
 
Missing data were indicated by the use of a “blank” in the patient listing displays. Answers such as 
“Not applicable” and “Not evaluable” were not considered to be missing data and were displayed as 
such. 
A worst-case assumption was applied to AEs and SAEs for which the treatment relationship was 
missing; they were imputed to be considered as related. 
In general, imputed partial dates were not used to derive study day, duration (e.g. , duration of AEs), 
or elapsed time variables. In addition, imputed dates were not used for deriving the last contact date 
in the OS analysis dataset. 
With the exception of a new anti-cancer medication start date for the time-to-event analysis datasets, 
and an exposure end date for the exposure analysis dataset, imputed dates were not kept as variables 
in the datasets.

Conduct of the study 
The most important amendment is described below. 
-  Amendment 7 (31-May-2017) 
The data cut-off for the primary endpoint analysis was changed from an event-driven time 
point (467 RFS events) to a follow up-driven time point (corresponding to a projected median 
study follow up of 3.3 years for all patients, and 2.5 years after Last patient, First dose). The 
new data cut-off for the primary analysis was defined on 30-Jun-2017 when approximately 410 
RFS events were expected to occur providing sufficient power (92%) to detect the originally 
targeted HR=0.71. These changes occurred prior to study unblinding. 
An additional OS interim analysis was added to be applied when approximately 299 death 
events have occurred; i.e,. at 50% information fraction of the originally targeted 597 OS 
events in order to provide early efficacy information on survival, since the final OS will occur 
much later. 
After pre-screening of 2258 patients, 1442 (64%) tested BRAF V600 mutation positive. A total of 870 
patients  were  randomized  between  31-Jan-2013  to  11-Dec-2014  in  the  study,  438  patients  in  the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 432 patients in the placebo arm. A total of 3 patients were not treated, 
all  in  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  arm.  Two  of  these  3  patients  withdrew  consent,  and  one  was 
withdrawn  at  the  discretion  of  the  Investigator  as  the  patient  did  not  comply  with  study  procedures 
(Table 9).

Last patient, last dose occurred on 01-Dec-2015. By the time of data cut-off (30-Jun-2017), the 
median patient follow-up time was 34 months (range: 0-51 months) in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm 
and 33 months (range: 1-50 months) in the placebo arm. At the time of the data cut-off, all patients 
still in the study were off treatment and in the follow-up phase (Table 10).

157 patients (18%) were current smokers, 223 (26%) were former smokers and 489 patients (56%) 
were non-smokers. The proportion of smokers and non-smokers was balanced between the treatment 
arms. 56% of patients had regular alcohol consumption and the median alcohol units/week was 3.0 (0-
112 units/week). 48 patients (6%) had a family history of melanoma, which was balanced between the 
two treatment arms.

Prior anti-cancer surgery 
All patients underwent tumour excision prior to enrollment. The same proportion of patients (53%) in 
each arm had sentinel lymphadenectomy. The median number of lymph nodes removed by 
lymphadenectomy was similar between the treatment arms, 16 in dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 17 
in placebo arm. 
Stratification factors 
The percentage of patients falling into each category for stratification factors of disease stage and 
mutation status entered into RAMOS were identical between the treatment arms. One patient had both 
BRAF V600E and V600K mutation and was stratified as V600K at randomization. This patient received 
dabrafenib+trametinib (Table 14). 
Table 14:

Numbers analysed 
All 870 randomized patients were included in the ITT population (Table 15). Three patients were not 
treated, all in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, and were thus excluded from the Safety population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results - Relapse Free Survival 
The primary RFS analysis was conducted at the pre-defined cut-off date of 30-Jun-2017, at which time 
414 RFS events were observed; 166 events (38%) in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 248 events 
(57%) in the placebo arm. Types of recurrence considered as an event were loco-regional, distant 
metastases, and second primary melanoma. 
The study met its primary objective. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated 
superiority over placebo for the primary endpoint of RFS per the investigator’s assessment with an 
estimated HR of 0.47 and 95%CI 0.39-0.58 in favour of the dabrafenib+trametinib treatment arm. 
This result was highly statistically significant with p=1.53x10-14 (stratified Log-rank test, two-sided) 
(Table 16).  
Using the data cut-off date of 30-Apr-2018, the median patient follow-up was 44 months in the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 42 months in the placebo arm. The results are shown in Table 16.

Figure 6: 
Kaplan-Meier curve investigator-assessed RFS (primary analysis; ITT; 30-Apr-
2018) 
Most of the RFS events in both the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and the placebo arm were distant 
recurrences (103 patients; 24% and 133 patients; 31%, respectively). More patients in the placebo 
arm had local or regional recurrence (114 patients; 26%) compared to the dabrafenib+trametinib arm 
(61 patients; 14%) (Table 16). 
It should be noted that in the RFS analysis only the first occurrence is counted as an event. For 
example, if a patient experienced a local recurrence first followed by a distant recurrence at a later 
time point, only the former one is counted as an event. There were, however, several patients who 
experienced several types of recurrence on the same day and were thus counted in several categories 
of recurrence subtypes. In particular, 7 patients in each arm had both local/regional and distant 
recurrence observed on the same day. In addition, 1 patient in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 1 
patient in the placebo arm had both disease recurrence and secondary primary melanoma observed on 
the same. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Overall survival 
As the primary endpoint of the study was met and was statistically significant, the key secondary 
endpoint of OS was formally tested with an interim OS analysis performed with a total of 153 deaths; 
60 in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 93 in the placebo arm, representing 26% of the total 
targeted 597 deaths required for the final OS analysis. 
The estimated HR for OS was 0.57 (95%CI 0.42, 0.79) (stratified Log-rank test p=0.0006, two-sided). 
As the two-sided threshold for significance at this first interim analysis was p=0.000019, this result is 
not considered statistically significant (Table 18). The significance threshold was determined based on 
the observed information fraction and predefined 3-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with an 
O’Brien-Fleming type boundary. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 38/97 
 
 
 
 
Median OS was not reached in either arm; the OS data are still immature due to the low number of 
events observed (Table 18). 331 (76%) patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 277 (64%) 
patients in the placebo arm were censored and are still being followed for OS events. Follow-up for the 
remaining 47 patients (11%) and 62 patients (14%) in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and placebo 
arm, respectively, has ended (Table 18).

Figure 7: 
Kaplan-Meier OS (ITT) 
A sensitivity analysis based on the Cox model which included only treatment as a covariate confirmed 
the results of the primary analysis for OS (HR=0.57; 95%CI 0.41, 0.79). 
A stratified multivariate Cox regression analysis of OS produced treatment effect estimates adjusted 
for key baseline prognostic factors (covariates). The results were numerically slightly better compared 
to the covariate unadjusted estimate of the primary analysis (HR =0.52; 95%CI 0.37, 0.73) (see also 
Table 14.2-2.8 clinical study report). 
An additional OS interim analysis is planned when approximately 299 death events have occurred, i.e. 
at 50% information fraction of the 597 OS events needed for the final OS analysis, to provide early 
efficacy information on survival, since the final OS analysis is expected to occur much later. 
Follow-up anti-cancer therapy 
Summary of post-treatment anti-cancer therapies is presented in Table 19; based on the safety 
dataset, which includes all patients who received at least one dose of randomized treatment. A higher 
proportion of patients in the placebo arm (42%) compared to the treatment arm (28%) received post-
treatment anti-cancer therapy, which is primarily due to a higher number of disease relapses in the 
placebo arm.  Median time from disease recurrence to start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy was 
similar between the two arms (7.1 weeks for dabrafenib+trametinib and 7.3 weeks for placebo).

Table 19: 
Summary of post-treatment anti-cancer therapy (safety population) 
Summary of post-treatment anti-cancer therapies in patients with disease recurrence (excluding death 
as RFS event) is presented in Table 20. This analysis (based on 163 patients in the 
dabrafenib+trametinib and 247 patients in the placebo arm) demonstrated that a similar proportion of 
patients in each arm received systemic anticancer therapy post-relapse (70% in the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 72% in the placebo arm). 
The proportion of patients receiving immunotherapy was higher in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm 
(52%) than in the placebo arm (38%). Conversely, the use of targeted therapy, such as BRAF and/or 
MEK inhibitors, was more frequently used in the placebo arm (55%) as compared to the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm (37%). Chemotherapy was administered in a lower proportion of patients 
in both arms (12% in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 9% in the placebo arm).

Distant metastasis-free survival 
In the DMFS analysis, the first occurrence of distant metastasis or death (if it occurred before 
documented recurrence) was counted as an event. 
The estimated HR based on the analysis of 30-Apr-2017 for DMFS was 0.51 (CI95 0.40, 0.65) and was 
in favor of the dabrafenib+trametinib arm. The DMFS event analysis included 106 relapses and 4 
deaths in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 150 relapses and 2 deaths in the placebo arm. The 
median DMFS was not reached in either treatment arm due to the low event rates (Figure 9). The 
percentage of patients who were censored with no additional follow-up was similar between the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm (23%) and the placebo arm (30%). The K-M estimated DMFS rate at 3 
years was 71% (95%CI 66%, 76%) in dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 57% (95%CI 52%, 63%) in the 
placebo arm.

Freedom from relapse 
In the FFR analysis, local or distant recurrence or a new primary melanoma were counted as events, 
and patients who died of causes other than melanoma or treatment-related toxicity were censored. 
The estimated HR for FFR was 0.47 (95%CI 0.39, 0.57), in favor of the dabrafenib+trametinib arm. 
The FFR event analysis included a total of 412 disease- or treatment-related relapses or deaths. 
Among these, 163 (37%) events of relapse and 2 deaths occurred in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, 
and 247 (57%) events of relapse and no deaths occurred in the placebo arm. In the FFR analysis, local 
or distant recurrence or a new primary melanoma were counted as events, and patients who died of 
causes other than melanoma or treatment-related toxicity were censored. Median FFR was 16.6 
months in the placebo arm and was not reached in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm (Figure 10). The 
percentage of patients who were censored with no additional follow-up available was similar between 
the dabrafenib+trametinib arm (10%) and the placebo arm (8%).

Health-related quality of life 
EQ-5D questionnaire completion rates as a percentage of available patients at the time of assessment 
were at the month 12 assessment 93% in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 97% in the placebo 
arm; the completion rates were 92% for the first 3 years in both treatment arms.  
At months 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48, the number (%) of patients in the dabrabefenib+trametinib arm with 
EQ-5D data available were 363 (83%), 337 (77%), 254 (58%), 186 (42%), and 42 (10%), 
respectively. Whereas for patients in the placebo arm, data were available for 298 (69%), 236 (55%), 
172 (40%), 132 (31%), and 31 (7%), respectively.  
Baseline scores were comparable between arms for the thermometer scale (or visual analogue scale) 
and health utility scores as measured by the EQ-5D. When assessed for differences between treatment 
arms using mixed-model repeated measures analyses, there was no statistically significant difference 
in thermometer or utility scores between the two treatment arms and changes from baseline were 
minimal for all assessments throughout the treatment period.  
ECOG performance status 
All ECOG analyses were based on the ITT population. In the presence of missing data, the analysis of 
time-to-definitive deterioration in ECOG PS was provided. Definitive deterioration was defined as a 
definitive increase in PS by at least one category of the score from baseline. Deterioration was 
considered definitive if no improvements in the ECOG PS status were observed after an instance of 
deterioration. The estimated HR indicated a 24% lower risk of definitive deterioration of ECOG 
performance status with dabrafenib+trametinib (HR=0.76; 95%CI 0.49, 1.16) with nominal p-value 
equal to 0.193) (Figure 11).

RFS censoring

A total of 272 patients (62%) in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 184 patients (43%) in the placebo 
arm were censored in the primary analysis of RFS. The reasons for censoring are detailed in Table 22. 
Table 22: 
Summary of reasons for censoring 
The percentages of patients censored as being event-free at the data analysis cut-off date are higher 
in the treatment arm corresponding to the larger number of RFS events observed in the placebo arm. 
Of note, those numbers were derived as the total number of censored patients minus patients 
censored for other censoring reasons (extended loss to follow-up, start of new anticancer therapy, no 
adequate post-baseline assessment, unresected melanoma at screening) and without taking into 
account withdrawal from the study. Therefore, the number of patients censored as being ‘event-free at 
the data analysis cut-off date’ as presented in Table 22 are higher than the number of patient 
‘censored with follow-up ongoing’ as presented in Table 16 in which the study withdrawals were taken 
into account. The impact of censoring due to extended loss to follow up and due to start of a new anti-
cancer therapy was addressed by sensitivity analysis #3. 
Sensitivity and supportive analyses of RFS 
Results from sensitivity analyses are shown below with HR point estimate ranging between 0.47 to 
0.48 (Figure 12 and Table 23).

Multivariate Cox Regression 
A stratified multivariate Cox model was fitted to better estimate the effects of the prognostic 
characteristics on RFS and their impact on the treatment effect. The multivariate model for RFS 
included prognostic characteristics of gender (male, female), tumour staging and ulceration, nodal 
stage, presence or absence of in-transit disease, and melanoma subtype (superficial spreading, 
nodular and other) as covariates. The HR for treatment effect after adjusting for these covariates was 
0.43 (95%CI 0.35, 0.53).

Staging IIIA-C according to the new AJCC staging 
A post-hoc subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate RFS in patients by disease stage based on 
AJCC 8 classification. The 870 patients, randomized to the dabrafenib+trametinib arm (n=438) and the 
placebo arm (n=432), were re-categorized as per AJCC 8 staging system into stage IIIA 
(dabrafenib+trametinib, n=50; placebo, n=39), stage IIIB dabrafenib+trametinib, n=145; placebo, 
n=154), stage IIIC (dabrafenib+trametinib, n=217; placebo, n=214), and stage IIID 
(dabrafenib+trametinib, n=22; placebo, n=17). Four patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 8 
patients in the placebo arm were not recategorized to the AJCC8 classification due to missing 
information in T or N categories.  
The results are shown in Table 24.

2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design- COMBI-AD is a randomised, double-blind phase III trial to evaluate the combination of 
dabrafenib  and  trametinib  versus  two  placebos  as  adjuvant  treatment  in  high-risk  BRAF  V600E/K 
mutant  melanoma  after  surgical  resection.  870  patients  were  randomised  1:1  with  stratification  by 
BRAF  status  and  disease  stage.  Although  treatment  assignment  was  blinded  for  investigators,  it  is 
likely  that  due  to  class-specific  toxicity,  investigators  would  know  for  at  least  a  part  of  the  study 
population that dabrafenib+trametinib was given. However, it is also regarded unavoidable in this type 
of trial. Physicians could request treatment unblinding post-recurrence to determine the next therapy, 
which is understandable to provide best patient care.  
RFS was a primary endpoint with OS as a key secondary endpoint while other supportive secondary 
efficacy endpoints were DMFS (distant metastases or death), and FFR (local or distant recurrence with 
censoring of death from causes other than melanoma or treatment-related toxicity at the date of 
death). These endpoint were considered acceptable in the adjuvant setting.  Although treatment 
assignment was blinded for investigators, it is likely that due to class-specific toxicity, investigators 
would know for at least a part of the study population that dabrafenib+trametinib was given. In that 
aspect, central assessment of radiological exams would have provided a more objective assessment of 
the results, however, given the robustness of the primary endpoint RFS, there are no uncertainties 
concerning the observation of radiological or clinical recurrence of disease.

The choice of placebo comparators is acceptable as there are no standard of care treatments for stage 
III adjuvant melanoma. Treatment was given for a maximum of 12 months or until disease recurrence, 
death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent as it is unknown what the optimal duration of 
treatment should be from a scientific rationale, but it is agreed as there is no evidence for an 
alternative to the proposal of 1-year treatment duration. For patients that relapse or do not respond to 
therapy, there is no evidence that prolonged treatment would be of benefit. Hence, the 1 year duration 
is acceptable based on clinical practice for adjuvant treatment.  Overall, the study design is consistent 
with the scientific advice (SA) of 2012 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/381667/2012) for the adjuvant setting in 
melanoma patients.  
Study population-Patients with lower risk melanoma, i.e. stage IIIA with lymph node metastasis <1 
mm were not included. This information has been described in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Study conduct - There were no concerns on the conduct of the study. The MAH altered the timing of 
RFS and OS interim analyses including alpha spending. This change in timing of analysis was endorsed 
during a follow-up SA in 2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/209337/2017). Apart from the planned interim OS 
analysis at time of the RFS analysis, an additional OS interim analysis with 299 events (50% 
information fraction, projected to occur in December 2019) was implemented after endorsement of the 
same SA. The rationale was the low event rate on OS. The type of alpha spending for OS (2 interim, 
one final) was proposed to be changed (from O’Brien-Fleming to Pocock), but in the end was not 
changed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline characteristics- The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced 
between the treatment arms.  
Primary endpoint RFS- The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant 
effect of the treatment arm with HR 0.47 (95%CI 0.39-0.58; p=1.53x10-14). Median time to reach RFS 
was 16.6 months in the placebo arm (95%CI 12.7-22.1) and not reached in the treatment arm 
(95%CI 44.5-NE). Also RFS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.88 v 0.56, 0.67 v 0.44 and 0.58 v 0.39 
in favour of the treatment arm compared to placebo. Sensitivity analyses were all supportive of the 
efficacy of the dabrafenib+trametinib arm (only 14 vs 8 subjects, 3% vs 2%, were censored for 
potentially informative reasons). Subgroup analyses all showed HR<1 in favour of the treatment arm, 
including for known prognostic factors such as disease stage, nodal status and ulceration.   
An additional data cut-off at 30-Apr-2018 with an extra 10 months of follow-up showed consistent 
results with HR 0.49 (95%CI 0.40-0.59) with the RFS Kaplan-Meier curves separating after the first 
assessment on study in favour of dabrafenib+trametinib. Compared to the primary RFS analysis 17 
additional RFS event were recorded (11 in dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 6 in placebo arm). Median 
follow-up was 44 months in the dabrafenib+trametinib group and 42 months in the placebo group. The 
curves are interpretable until ~38 months, which is considered adequate, given that most recurrences 
occur <3 years. With the additional follow-up in both the placebo arm and in the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm a plateau is visible, indicating cure, but importantly, at 3 years the 
difference in RFS rate was 19% in favour of the dabrafenib+trametinib arm. Support that the RFS data 
are mature is provided by the event and censoring rates. The number of events after 36 months is low 
in both arms and seems to stabilise. 
A cure rate modelling was performed with the RFS data from the 30-Apr-2018 cut-off. The MAH did not 
provide the methodology on how this analysis was performed. The cure rate model seems to fit the 
RFS Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 53/97 
 
 
 
Key secondary endpoint OS- According to the hierarchical statistical testing plan, OS was tested 
after statistical significance of RFS (first interim analysis) with a total 153 deaths, being 26% of the 
total targeted of 597 deaths required for the final analysis. The number of events was 60 (14%) in the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 93 (22%) in the placebo arm. Median OS was immature and not 
reached in either arm. HR was 0.57 (95%CI 0.42-0.79) and the threshold for significance was not 
reached. OS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.97 v 0.94, 0.91 v 0.83 and 0.86 v 0.77 in favour of the 
treatment arm compared to placebo. Thus, the data are not mature yet, but they show a trend to 
support the favourable RFS in the experimental arm. The second interim analysis is projected to be 
available in 2022 with 50% information fraction planned. 
Secondary endpoint DMFS- Median DMFS was not reached in either treatment arm due to low event 
rates, but the HR of 0.51 (95%CI 0.40-0.65) also showed a trend in support for the treatment arm, as 
was the 3-year DMFS rate. Based on the cut-off date of 30-Apr-2018 the estimated HR for DMFS was 
0.53 (95%CI 0.42-0.67). In the Kaplan-Meier curves considerable censoring is shown, but the clear 
separation of the curves on this relevant secondary endpoint is supportive for the RFS benefit of 
dabrafenib+trametinib as adjuvant melanoma treatment. 
Secondary endpoint FFR- In the FFR analysis, patients were censored for death from other causes 
than melanoma or treatment-related toxicity at the date of death and results are expected to be 
similar to the primary endpoint. Indeed the number of events and HR results were very similar to the 
data for RFS and are considered supportive. 
Post-treatment anti-cancer therapy- For the patients with disease recurrence 87% and 82% of the 
patients received post-treatment anti-cancer therapy in the treatment and control arm, respectively. 
Systemic treatment was given in 70% and 72%, a similar proportion in both treatment arms. In the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm this was mainly immunotherapy (52%), and BRAF-inhibition with or 
without MEK-inhibition (37%). For the placebo-treated patients these numbers were 38% and 55%. 
Responses to next-line systemic treatment were provided. The majority of patients with a recurrence 
received next-line immunotherapy or targeted therapy. There is a trend towards lower responses to 
immunotherapy post recurrence in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm compared to patients that were 
treated with placebo, however the numbers are too small to draw definitive conclusions. Complete and 
partial responses were observed, also after dabrafenib+trametinib. Responses were also seen after 
next-line targeted therapy including BRAF-MEK-inhibition and immunotherapy). RFS2 data were not 
collected, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of next-line treatment. Responses were observed for 
next-line treatment (including BRAF-MEK-inhibition and immunotherapy), which is reassuring. Due to 
the small numbers, definitive conclusions about increased resistance to next-line therapy after 
adjuvant dabrafenib+trametinib cannot be made. 
Immunotherapy as well as BRAF and MEK inhibitors (as single agent or in combination) have proven to 
be efficacious treatments in metastatic melanoma, thus; suggesting that patients had a similar access 
to highly effective therapies post relapse. This observation provides additional support to the 
conclusion that the survival improvement observed can be attributed to the combination treatment of 
dabrafenib and trametinib. 
Exploratory endpoint- There were no statistically significant differences in HRQOL measures between 
the two arms and, during the study, changes from baseline were minimal. Since disease-related 
symptoms are not expected in an adjuvant setting, this suggests that the treatment has no negative 
impact on QoL. Changes in ECOG performance scale were also similar between the two groups.  
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG oncology was invited to provide its expert’s views on the following point: 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 54/97 
 
 
 
Do  you  consider  that  the  currently  available  results  from  the  COMBI-AD  trial,  on  the 
Mekinist-Tafinlar combination in the adjuvant treatment setting for melanoma, are sufficient 
to demonstrate clinical benefit? 
The  SAG  unanimously  agreed  that  the  currently  available  results  from  the  COMBI-AD  trial  clearly 
demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  combination  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of 
melanoma  in  the  target  population  studied.  This  was  based  on  clinically  and  statistically  compelling 
difference  in  terms  of  the  clinically  relevant  endpoint  of  recurrence-free  survival  (in  accordance  with 
the present anticancer guidelines); trend towards overall survival improvement and curative potential; 
consistent  effect  on  distant  metastasis-free  survival;  supportive  data  from  the  metastatic  setting; 
acceptable safety profile with mostly with mainly reversible toxicity. 
Concerning the possibility to induce resistance for subsequent treatments, the positive trend in survival 
is reassuring and currently data on re-challenging post-recurrence are lacking. It will be of interest to 
see the pattern of recurrence (on or off-treatment) to elucidate some mechanistic aspect. It was also 
discussed  that  it  may  be  possible  to  further  optimise  dose  although  such  studies  are  difficult  to 
conduct. 
There  was  some  discussion  about  whether  the  effect  observed  could  be  extrapolated  to  the  current 
stage  IIIA  classification  (TNM  classification  version  8)  that  includes  slightly  better  prognosis  patients 
than those treated in the study (version 7; stage IIIA [lymph node metastasis >1 mm]). The prevalent 
view  was  that  the  effects  observed  could  be  extrapolated  to  the  new  staging  system  and  that  any 
uncertainty about treating lower-risk patients should be part of the patient-physician discussion. 
In conclusion, the present data demonstrate a clearly positive benefit-risk balance. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the study design of COMBI-AD is considered acceptable. The combination of dabrafenib 
and trametinib not only leads to a prolonged RFS benefit, but also increases cure rate. The primary 
endpoint is supported by a trend in OS and support from secondary endpoints DMFS, and FFR as well 
as subgroup analyses. The combination of dabrafenib+trametinib demonstrates a significant and 
relevant long-term effect in the adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma. In the adjuvant melanoma 
setting, patients should be treated for a period of 12 months unless there is disease recurrence or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
In the COMBI-AD trial patient with stage IIIA disease were only included if the lymph node metastasis 
was >1 mm. In the AJCC staging, both 7th and 8th edition, this cut-off is not used. It is agreed with 
the SAG that by using the cut-off of 1 mm in the inclusion criteria, slightly better prognosis patients 
with stage IIIA disease were not included in the study.  
As OS data are currently immature, there is a requirement for the verification of the impact of the 
intervention on the OS outcome. Therefore, the CHMP expects the MAH to submit the following 
measures to address issues related to efficacy: 
•  Results  from  the  second  OS  interim  analysis  of  the  COMBI    AD  trial  with  50%  of  the  information 
fraction should be submitted by Q4 2022. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures in order to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
The MAH discussed their biomarker plan to assess baseline and relapse tissue samples. Biomarker 
results  from  all  tissue  samples  and  from  plasma  samples  collected  at  time  of  relapse  from  the 
COMBI-AD trial should be submitted (expected to be available for submission in 2019).

2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  dabrafenib  plus  trametinib  safety  data  described  below  is  derived  from  the  BRF115532  study  in 
stage  III  melanoma  patients  in  the  adjuvant  setting.  The  existing  safety  profile  of  trametinib  (2  mg 
QD)  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  (150  mg  BID)  in  patients  with  BRAF  V600  mutation  positive 
unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  was  based  on  two  phase  III  studies  (MEK115306  and 
MEK116513).  The  most  common  AEs  seen  at  ≥  20%  included  pyrexia,  fatigue,  nausea,  chills, 
diarrhoea,  cough,  headache,  hypertension,  rash,  vomiting,  arthralgia  and  peripheral  oedema.  Most 
common  grade  3  events  were  pyrexia  (4-7%)  and  hypertension  (6-14%)  and  most  common  SAEs 
were  pyrexia  (14-17%)  and  decreased  ejection  fraction  (4-7%).  In  these  studies  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the skin (cuSCC) was reported more frequently in the BRAF inhibitor monotherapy arms 
compared to the combination therapy arms (4-10% vs <1%). Six fatal bleedings were observed in the 
combination therapy arms, to which a contribution of the therapy could not be ruled out. Haemorrhage 
is already addressed in section 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC. Toxicity was generally manageable, despite 
higher  rates  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  mitigation  or  interruption  and  higher  rates  of  SAEs  observed  in 
patients treated with combination therapy versus monotherapy components. Following assessments of 
PSURs, photosensitivity was identified as a common AE and acute, severe left ventricular dysfunction 
due  to  myocarditis  (reversible  upon  stopping  treatment)  was  added  to  the  warning  on  LVEF 
reduction/LV dysfunction in the SmPC and colitis was added as an uncommon AE for the combination 
therapy.

By the time of data cut-off (30-Jun-2017), the median patient follow-up time was 34 months (range: 
0-51 months) in the D+T group and 33 months (range: 1-50 months) in the placebo group. At the 
time of the cut-off, all patients still in the study were off treatment and in the follow –up phase.  
Median duration of exposure was 11 months for both dabrafenib and trametinib, and 10 months for the 
placebo arm. Details on exposure to study treatment are shown in Table 26 and Table 27.

Table 26: 
Exposure to study treatment 
Table 27: 
Summary of exposure by cumulative duration for D+T therapy 
Permanent discontinuations 
In the D+T group, 272 patients (63%) completed scheduled dabrafenib treatment and 277 (64%) 
completed scheduled trametinib treatment. In the D+T group, 163 patients (37%) discontinued 
dabrafenib treatment and 158 patients (36%) discontinued trametinib treatment. In the placebo 
group, 205 (47%) discontinued treatment prematurely. 
Dose modifications 
Dose reductions 
Patients with dose reductions were more frequent in the D+T arm (43% (n=188) of the patients with 
dabrafenib and 24% (n=104) trametinib) compared to the placebo arm (12% (n=54) of the patients 
with dabrafenib placebo and 2% (n=8) trametinib placebo). The total number of dose reductions was 
307 for dabrafenib and 62 for its placebo and 134 for trametinib vs 8 for its placebo. The most 
common reasons for dose reductions were AEs (98% (n=131) of the dose reductions in the dabrafenib 
and 74% (n=227) trametinib) vs (88% (n=7) and 13% (n=8) of the dose reductions in the respective 
placebo groups) and subject non-compliance in both treatment arms. 
In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, 2 or more dabrafenib dose reductions were required in 87 patients 
(20%) and 2 or more trametinib reductions were reported in 30 patients (7%). Most dose reductions in 
the  placebo  arm  occurred  once.  For  patients  who  have  a  dose  reduction  due  to  AEs  early  on  in 
treatment,  it  appears  that  the  KM  RFS  curve  is  superior  to  the  RFS  curve  of  patients  in  the  placebo 
arm.

Dose escalations 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  dose  escalations  was  similar  in  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  arm  (4% 
dabrafenib  and  4%  trametinib)  and  in  the  placebo  arm  (2%  dabrafenib  placebo  and  5%  trametinib 
placebo).  The  most  common  reason  for dose  escalation  was  following  AE  resolution or  due  to  patient 
non-compliance. 
Dose interruptions 
Dose interruptions are summarized in Table 28.

Summary of dose interruptions 
Adverse events  
AEs were graded according CTCAE v4.0. AEs were coded using MedDRA version 19.1. AEs by preferred 
term (PTs) were summarized by frequency and percentage of patients and sorted by MedDRA System 
Organ Classes (SOC). Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) were analysed separately. 
AEs were recorded from the time the first dose of study treatment administration until 30 days after 
discontinuation of study treatment, with the exceptions of treatment emergent malignancies (reported 
regardless of the time from treatment discontinuation to occurrence of the event) and SAEs related to 
study treatments (reported at any follow up contact). A summary of AEs and deaths is presented in 
Table 29.

Table 29: 
Overview of AEs and death 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  by  preferred  term  are  reported  in  Table  30.  Grade  3/4  AEs  were 
reported  in  41%  (39%  grade  3,  3%  grade  4)  patients  in  the  D+T  treatment  group  and  14%  (14% 
grade 3, grade 4 <1%) in placebo group; the most frequently reported grade 3-4 AEs in the D+T arm 
were hypertension (6%), pyrexia (5%), fatigue (4%), and elevated ALT (4%). Grade 3/4 AEs were not 
frequently reported in the placebo arm. 
AEs considered treatment related 
Almost  all  AEs  in  the  D+T  arm  were  considered  treatment-related.  The  percentages  of  patients  with 
AEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment  were  higher  in  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  arm  (91%) 
relative  to  the  placebo  arm  (63%).  The  percentage  of  patients  with  pyrexia,  fatigue,  chills,  nausea, 
headache, diarrhoea, arthralgia, rash, vomiting, increased ALT and increased AST was ≥10% higher in 
the D+T arm than in the placebo arm. The most common AEs related to study treatment are shown in 
Table 31. 
In the D+T arm, 129 patients (30%) had grade 3 treatment-related events versus 20 patients (5%) in 
the placebo arm, and 7 patients (2%) had grade 4 events versus respectively 1 patient (<1%).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs are reported in Table 34 and Table 35. In the placebo arm, SAEs rarely occurred; the only SAE 
occurring in at least 1% (5 patients) was decreased LVEF.  SAEs leading to hospitalization occurred in 
108 (25%) patients in the D+T arm and 25 (6%) patients in the placebo arm; pyrexia led to 
hospitalization in 11% of patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm. 
Among the 155 subjects in the dabrafenib-trametinib arm who experienced an SAE, 145 (94%)of the 
patients with an SAE, recovered from the event and 7 (4.5%) were either recovering or had recovered 
with sequelae at the time of the data cut-off (30-Jun-2017). Two subjects had not recovered at time of 
the data cutoff and 1 subject died due to pneumonia, which was not considered related to study drug. 
SAEs recurred after rechallenge in 29 (19%) subjects.

Deaths 
As  of  the  data  cut-off  (30-Jun-2017),  a  total  of  153  patients  died;  60  (14%)  in  the 
dabrafenib+trametinib  and  93  (22%) in  the  placebo  arm  (Table  36).  In  both  treatment  arms,  deaths 
were  most  commonly  related  to  disease  progression.  Five  deaths  occurred  within  30  days  from  last 
dose  of  study  medication  (on-treatment  deaths),  4  in  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  arm  and  1  in  the 
placebo arm. In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, 1 death was due to pneumonia (fatal SAE), all other 
on-treatment deaths were due to disease progression. The investigator did not suspect a relationship 
between the event (pneumonia) and the study treatment (dabrafenib+trametinib).

Other significant adverse events 
AEs leading to dose reduction 
AEs leading to dose reduction were reported in 38% (n=167) of patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib 
arm and in 3% (n=11) of patients in the placebo arm. In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, pyrexia (81 
patients; 19%), chills (17 patients; 4%), fatigue (13 patients; 3%) and decreased ejection fraction (11 
patients; 3%) arthralgia, neutropenia, increased ALT, influence like illness and vomiting (all 2%) were 
the most common AEs leading to dose reduction. In the placebo arm, events were observed in 3 or 
fewer patients each. The most dose reductions due to AEs (dabrafenib 71%; trametinib 52%) occur 
within the first 3 months of treatment in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm. 
In the D+T arm, 113 (67%) patients had Grade 1-2 AEs which led to dose reduction versus 54 (32%) 
patients with a dose reduction due to Grade 3-4 AEs. 
AEs leading to dose interruption 
AEs leading to dose interruption are displayed in Table 37.

Summary of AESIs (Safety population) 
Pyrexia 
Pyrexia was reported in 292 (67%) patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and in 66 (15%) in the 
placebo arm; 8% vs 3% of these events were grade 3 and 1 event vs 0 events were grade 4 in 
severity in the D+T arm and placebo arm, respectively. 
An SAE was reported in 24% (71/292), while in the placebo arm 6% (4/66) patients had pyrexia SAEs. 
In the D+T arm, 52% of the patients had 3 or more pyrexia episodes whereas in the placebo arm 68% 
experienced only 1 episode. 
In 99% of the patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, pyrexia resolved without sequelae; a similar 
proportion was observed in the placebo arm (97%). Dabrafenib and trametinib were discontinued due 
to pyrexia in 14% and 9% patients, respectively. Dose interruption/delays occurred in 69% patients 
for dabrafenib and 41% patients for trametinib and dose reductions in 29% and 6% respectively. 
Median time to onset of pyrexia events was 23 days in dabrafenib+trametinib arm compared to 53 
days in the placebo arm; with a median duration of 3 days in each arm. 
In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, 30% of patients received medications for prophylactic treatment of 
pyrexia and 48% received medication for active treatment of pyrexia compared to 2% and 5% in the 
placebo  arm.  Most  frequently  used  medications  to  treat  pyrexia  were  NSAIDs  (45%)  and 
corticosteroids (22%) in the D+T arm. Half of the patients requiring corticosteroids required treatment 
over 3 weeks.

Skin-related toxicities 
Skin-related toxicities occurred in 63% of patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 39% in the 
placebo arm. The most common skin-related toxicity was rash (24% in dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 
11% in placebo arm). Most events were grade 1 or 2 in severity (98% in dabrafenib+trametinib arm 
and 97% in placebo arm); grade 3 events were observed in 3% patients in either arm. Skin-related 
SAEs were reported in 2 patients in the D+T arm. In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm 40% of patients 
had 1 episode and 36% of the patients had 3 or more episodes. In the placebo arm, almost half of the 
patients reported only 1 episode (53%). Photosensitivity was reported in 13 (3%) of the D+T patients 
and in 16 (4%) of the placebo patients. At the time of the cut-off skin toxicity events were resolved in 
91% and 85% of patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib and placebo arms, respectively. 
Dose reductions occurred in 5%, interruptions/delays in 12% and discontinuation in 3% of the patients 
due to skin-related toxicities in the D+T arm. Median time to onset of skin-related toxicity events was 
44 days in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 56 days in the placebo arm. Median duration of events 
was similar in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm (34 days) and placebo arm (39 days). Use of 
prophylactic treatment for skin toxicity was reported in 10% of the patients in the D+T arm and in 3% 
in the placebo arm. Medication to actively treat skin toxicity was used in 34% and 14% of patients in 
the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and the placebo arm, respectively. Half of the patients requiring 
corticosteroids required treatment over 3 weeks. The median duration of skin toxicity treatment was 
similar between the 2 arms; 29 days and 27 days. 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea events occurred in 33% patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 15% patients in the 
placebo arm. Events were mainly grade 1/2 (97% of the events in the D+T arm and 98% in the 
placebo arm). One patient in the D+T arm had an SAE of diarrhoea. Most patients reported only 1 
occurrence of diarrhoea (74% in the D+T arm and 68% in the placebo arm). All diarrhoea events were 
resolved, except for 1 case in the placebo arm. 
No treatment discontinuations occurred due to diarrhoea. Dabrafenib dose reductions and 
interruptions/delays were reported in 2% and 8 % of patients, respectively. Trametinib dose 
reductions and interruptions/delays were reported 1% and 7% of patients, respectively. 
Time to onset of diarrhoea was 42 days in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm compared to 71 days in the 
placebo arm. The median duration of event was 6 days in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 3 days in 
the placebo arm. 
Hepatic disorders 
Hepatic disorders were reported in 91 (21%) patients in the D+T arm and 13 (3%) patients in the 
placebo arm. ALT and AST increased were the most frequently reported events (67 patients, 15% and 
63 patients, 14%) in the D+T arm; whereas in the placebo arm ALT and AST increased were reported 
in 6 patients (1%) and 7 patients (2%), respectively. 
In the treatment arm, 32% of the events were grade 3 events. In the placebo arm, 2/13 patients 
(15%) had grade 3 events, all other events were grade 1-2. Hepatic SAEs were reported in 6/91 
patients (7%) in the D+T arm and no events were reported in the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018  
Page 67/97 
 
 
 
All hepatic events either resolved or were resolving in 93% of patients in the D+T arm and 69% in the 
placebo arm at the time of data cut-off date. Dabrafenib and trametinib were discontinued due to 
hepatic disorders in 13% and 12% patients, respectively. Dose interruption/delays occurred in 25% of 
patients for dabrafenib and 26% of patients for trametinib. Median time to onset of hepatic disorders 
was 44 days in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm compared to 84 days in the placebo arm. The median 
duration of events was similar in both arms (dabrafenib+trametinib; 29 days and placebo arm; 29 
days). A summary of liver tests is shown in Table 40 under laboratory findings. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity events occurred in 94 (22%) patients in the D+T arm, as compared to 25 (6%) 
patients in the placebo arm. All patients in the placebo arm had grade 1/2 events, in the D+T arm 
most events were grade 1/2 events and 4 patients had grade 3 events. In the D+T arm 1 patient had 
hypersensitivity SAEs. 
In the D+T arm hypersensitivity events resolved in 98%, in the placebo arm all events were resolved. 
Dabrafenib dose reduction and interruption/delay was required in 7% and 16% of patients, 
respectively. Median time to onset of hypersensitivity events was 60 days with a median duration of 
events 32 days in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 57 days in the placebo arm with a median 
duration of 21 days in the placebo arm. 
Oedema 
Oedema events were observed in 87 (20%) patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 45 (10%) 
patients in the placebo arm. Grade 3 events were reported in 2 patients in the D+T arm and 1 patient 
in the placebo arm; all other events were grade 1 or 2. 
In the D+T arm, 8% had 3 or more occurrences and in the placebo arm 1/45 patients had 3 or more 
occurrences. One patient in the placebo arm had an SAE of oedema. The majority of events had 
resolved in both arms: 72/87 (83%) patients in the D+T arm and 34/45 (76%) patients in the placebo 
arm. Median time to onset of oedema events was 91 days with a time to resolution of 68 days in the 
D+T arm and 88 days with a time to resolution of 62 days for placebo. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia events occurred in 18 (4%) patients in the D+T arm and 10 (2%) patients in the 
placebo arm. Grade 3 events occurred in 8 patients in the D+T arm and in 3 patients in the placebo 
arm; 1 patient in the placebo arm had a grade 4 event. In the D+T arm, 78% of patients had 1 
occurrence and 22% had 2 occurrences. In the placebo arm all patients had 1 occurrence. SAEs 
occurred in 2 patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and in 1 patient in the placebo arm. 
Events resolved for 12/18 (67%) patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and for 6/10 of the 
patients in the placebo arm. No treatment discontinuations for hyperglycaemia were reported. 
Dabrafenib dose reduction and interruption/delays occurred in 2 and 4 patients, respectively and 
trametinib dose interruption/delays occurred in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. 
Ocular events 
Ocular  events  were  observed  in  69  (16%)  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  and  41  (9%)  patients  in  the 
placebo  arm.  In  the  D+T  arm  3  patients  had  grade  3  events  and  1  had  a  grade  4  event;  the 
complaints  resolved  after  treatment  discontinuation  (n=2)  or  treatment  interruption  (n=2).  In  the 
placebo arm all events were grade 1/2. 
Assessment report

and 5 patients, respectively. Trametinib dose reduction and interruptions/delays occurred in 9 and 15 
patients, respectively. 
Uveitis 
Uveitis  was  observed  in  12  patients  (3%)  in  the  D+T  arm  and  none  in  the  placebo  arm.  One  patient 
had a grade 3 event and 1 had a grade 4 event; SAEs were reported in 4/12 patients. Among the 12 
patients with uveitis, dabrafenib was discontinued in 4 patients (33%) and trametinib was discontinued 
in  5  patients  (42%)  due  to  uveitis-related  events.  Dabrafenib  interruption/dose  delays  occurred  in  3 
patients  and  trametinib  reduction  and  interruption/dose  delays  occurred  in  2  and  6  patients, 
respectively. Eventually all cases resolved in the D+T arm. 
Bleeding events 
Bleeding  events  were  reported  in  67  (15%)  patients  in  the  dabrafenib+trametinib  arm  and  17  (4%) 
patients in the placebo arm. In the D+T arm a grade 3 SAE of haemorrhagic anaemia was observed, 
which  resolved  after  30  days,  when  study  treatment  was  interrupted.  In  the  placebo  arm  a  grade  3 
SAE of hepatic haemorrhage was observed which recovered after 3 days, no action was taken with the 
study treatment. All other bleeding events were grade 1 or 2. SAEs were reported in 1 patient in the 
D+T arm and 2 patients in the placebo arm. 
Most patients in the D+T and placebo arm had 1 occurrence. Events resolved in 64/67 patients in the 
D+T arm and in 14/17 in the placebo arm. No patient discontinued treatment due to bleeding events. 
Median duration of the bleeding event was 14 days in the D+T arm and 8 days in the placebo arm. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension  events  were  observed  in  53  (12%)  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  and  37  (9%)  patients  in 
placebo  arm.  Grade  3  events  were  reported  in  27/53  (51%)  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  and  in  8/37 
(22%) in the placebo arm. In the D+T arm 1 patient had 3 or more occurrences; all other patients had 
1 or 2 occurrences. No SAEs were observed in either arm. 
Events resolved in 41/53 patients in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 24/37 patients in the placebo 
arm.  Dabrafenib  dose  reduction  and  interruptions/delays  were  reported  in  4  and  5  patients, 
respectively.  Trametinib  dose  reduction  and  interruptions/delays  were  reported  in  4  and  6  patients, 
respectively. Median time to onset of hypertension events was 78 days in the D+T arm and 84 days in 
the placebo arm; median time for events to be resolved was 45 days in the D+T arm and 77 days in 
the placebo arm. 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia events were observed in 51 (12%) patients in the D+T arm, and 6 (1%) patients in the 
placebo arm. In the D+T arm, 21/51 patients had grade 3 events; all events in the placebo arm were 
grade  1  or  2.  SAEs  occurred  in  4  patients  in  the  D+T  arm.  Febrile  neutropenia  (grade  3  SAE)  was 
observed  in  2  patients,  which  resolved  in  one  patient  after  treatment  modifications  and  in  the  other 
after the treatment was discontinued. 
All neutropenia events resolved; however, study treatment was discontinued in 7 patients. Dabrafenib 
dose reduction and interruptions/delays occurred in 10 and 16 patients, respectively. Trametinib dose 
reduction and interruptions/delays occurred in 11 and 16 patients, respectively.

Median time to onset of neutropenia events in the D+T arm was 42 days with a duration of 14 days; 
time to onset was 73 days with a median duration of 29 days in the placebo arm. 
Cardiac-related events 
Cardiac-related events were reported in 22 (5%) patients in the D+T arm and 7 (2%) patients in the 
placebo  arm.  In  the  placebo  arm,  1  patient  had  a  grade  3  event;  all other events  in  both  arms  were 
grade 1 or 2. In D+T arm, 2/22 patients had 2 occurrences and 1/7 patients in the placebo arm had 2 
occurrences; all other patients had 1 occurrence. SAEs occurred in 13/22 patients in the D+T arm and 
5/7 patients in the placebo arm. 
All  events  had  resolved  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off  date.  2  patients  discontinued  treatment  with 
dabrafenib and 3 patients discontinued treatment with trametinib due to cardiac-related events. 
Dabrafenib  dose  reduction  and  interruption/delay  occurred  in  1  and  14  patients,  respectively  while 
trametinib  dose  reduction  and  interruptions/delays  occurred  in  11  and  13  patients,  respectively. 
Median time to onset of cardiac-related events was 81 days in the D+T arm compared to 168 days in 
the placebo arm; median duration was 31 days in both arms. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (ECHO findings)  
The  specific  protocol-mandated  criteria  required  dose  interruption  if  the  LVEF  was  >10%  below 
baseline  and  below  the  institutional  LLN,  and  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  if  there 
was >20% absolute reduction from baseline. 
LVEF  decreases  of  any  level  occurred in  74%  of  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  and  63%  of  patients in  the 
placebo  arm.  Of  the  patients  with  a  decrease  in  LVEF,  a  decrease  of  <10%  was  reported in  217/311 
(70%) patients in the D+T arm and 209/262 (80%) in the placebo arm. A LVEF decrease of 10-19% 
was reported in 89/311 (29%) patients in the D+T arm and in 49/262 (19%) patients in the placebo 
arm. A LVEF decrease of ≥ 20% was observed in 2% of patients in both treatment arms. When sorted 
for worse-case-on-therapy, 15 patients (3% in the D+T arm and 8 patients (<2%) in the placebo arm 
had a decrease ≥10% resulting in an ejection fraction below the institution’s lower limit of normal. 
Pre-renal and intrinsic renal failure 
Pre-renal and intrinsic renal failure occurred in 7 patients (2%) in the D+T arm and in no patients in 
the placebo arm, of which 2 patients with SAEs. One patient had a grade 3 event and 1 patient had a 
grade 4 event. One patient discontinued dabrafenib and trametinib treatment due to these events. All 
patients recovered. The median time to onset was 57 days and the median duration was 6 days. 
Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism 
DVT/pulmonary embolism were observed in 7 patients in the D+T arm, and in 5 patients in the placebo 
arm. SAEs were reported in 3 patients in each arm. In the D+T arm, 5 patients had grade 3 events; in 
the placebo arm 2 patients had grade 3 events and 1 patient had a grade 4 event. With the exception 
of  1  patient  in  the  placebo  arm,  all  patients  recovered.  One  patient  discontinued  dabrafenib  and 
trametinib treatment due to a DVT event. Median time to resolution in the D+T arm and in the placebo 
arm was 92 and 33 days, respectively. 
Pancreatitis-related events 
Pancreatitis-related  events  occurred  in  six  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  (1  patient  had  pancreatitis  and  5 
patients had elevations in pancreatic enzymes). One patient in the placebo arm had increased amylase 
levels.

One patient had a grade 3 SAE pancreatitis due to gallstones, the patient had 2 previous grade 2 SAE 
episodes  of  pancreatitis  which  developed  after  a  gall  bladder  infection.  In  1  patients  with  a  grade  3 
increased  amylase  and  grade  4  increased  lipase  the  study  treatment  was  discontinued.  Both  events 
resolved  within  7  days.  Two  patients  had  grade  1  elevations  in  pancreatic  enzymes,  which  resolved 
after 29 days and 85 days, respectively. Two patients had grade 3 elevations in pancreatic enzymes, 
which resolved after 33 days and 8 days, respectively. The median time to resolution was 19 and 36 
days in the D+T and placebo arm respectively. 
Pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease 
One patient in the D+T arm had a grade 2 event of pneumonitis, which was not suspected to be study 
treatment-related. The event resolved without any change in treatment; the event started on day 19 
and last for 12 days. 
Cutaneous small cell carcinoma (cuSCC) including keratoacanthoma  
CuSCC were reported in 6 patients in the D+T arm and 5 patients in the placebo arm. CuSCC events 
had a delayed onset in both arms; 127 days in the D+T arm and 232 days in the placebo arm. 
In  the  D+T  arm  patients  were  observed  with  a  grade  1  Bowen’s  disease;  a  grade  2  basosquamous 
carcinoma, and a grade 1 SAE of Bowen's disease; a grade 2 SAE of Bowen’s disease-related, grade 3 
SAE  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  skin  and  a  grade  3  SAE  of  keratoacanthoma;  a  grade  1 
keratoacanthoma;  a  grade  3  SAE  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  a  grade  2  SAE  squamous  cell 
carcinoma.  In  the  placebo  arm  patients  were  observed  with  2  grade  3  SAEs  of  squamous  cell 
carcinoma; a grade 3 SAE of squamous cell carcinoma; a grade 2 SAE of squamous cell carcinoma; a 
two grade 2 SAEs: one of Bowen's disease and one of keratoacanthoma and a grade 1 SAE of Bowens 
disease. All events in D+T arm and placebo arm resolved. 
Non-cutaneous treatment-emergent malignancies 
Non-cutaneous  treatment-emergent  malignancies  occurred  in  5  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  and  in  3 
patients in the placebo arm. Median time to onset of was 157 days versus 86 days, respectively. 
In  the  D+T  arm  patients  were  reported  to  have  a  grade  1  SAE  of  endometrial  adenocarcinoma;  a 
grade  1  event  of  dysplastic  naevus  syndrome;  a  grade  3  SAE  of  B-cell  lymphoma;  a  grade  3  SAE  of 
prostate cancer and a grade 4 SAE of endometrial adenocarcinoma. 
In  the  placebo  arm  patients  were  reported  to  have  a  grade  3  SAE  of  bladder  transitional  cell 
carcinoma; a grade 3 metastases to the central nervous system and a grade 3 SAE of renal cancer. In 
the D+T arm 60% of the events resolved, in the placebo arm all events resolved. 
New primary melanoma 
In the D+T arm 1 patient had malignant melanoma. In the placebo arm 6 patients had a new primary 
melanoma events. Median time of onset was 30 days in the D+T arm and 74 days in the placebo arm. 
In the D+T arm one patient had a grade 3 SAE malignant melanoma. In the placebo arm patients were 
observed with a grade 1 malignant melanoma in situ; a grade 3 SAE, malignant melanoma in situ; a 
grade  3  SAE  malignant  melanoma;  a  grade  2  SAE  malignant  melanoma;  a  grade  3  SAE  malignant 
melanoma and a grade 3 SAE of lentigo maligna. Eventually all events resolved.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
The most frequently observed changes from baseline in the D+T arm were neutrophils decreased 
(47%), leukocyte count decreased (43%), lymphocytes decreased (26%), and haemoglobin decreased 
(25%). Changes in haematology laboratory values as well as grade 3 changes were more frequent in 
the D+T arm compared to placebo arm (Table 39). 
Table 39: 
Worst-case on-therapy haematology grade changes from baseline 
Clinical chemistry 
There were no clinically relevant changes in biochemistry parameters assessed between the 2 
treatment arms. For those laboratory tests that were not graded according to NCI CTCAE criteria, an 
analysis was conducted using the normal ranges. Events of LDH increase above ULN (66% vs 12%), 
and high C-reactive protein (96% vs 70%) were more frequent in the D+T arm compared to the 
placebo arm.. 
ECG changes 
At Baseline and at Month 12, most patients (>70%) in both treatment arms had normal ECG readings. 
Three patients (<1%) in each arm had a QTcB grade 3 increase (≥ 501 sec), with a corresponding 
increase of >60 msec from Baseline. All of the increases were transient. In all three patients in the 
D+T arm the QTcB value returned to normal at the next monthly visit, in one patient after the study 
treatment was interrupted, in the other two patients no dose modification were performed. In the 
placebo arm the treatment was interrupted in two patients and in one patient the dose was not 
modified.

Liver tests 
A summary of liver tests is given in Table 40. 
Table 40: 
Summary of liver tests (safety population) 
Three patients treated in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm showed a concomitant increase of ALT >3 x 
ULN and bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN.  
Safety in special populations 
The subgroup analysis by age included 709 patients in the age group of <65 years, and 158 patients in 
the age group of ≥ 65 years. The percentage of patients with any AE was slightly higher in patients < 
65 (dabrafenib+trametinib vs placebo: 97% vs 87% in patients <65 years of age, and 96% vs 92% in 
patients ≥ 65 years of age). 
In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm the proportions of patients with events in the <65 years and ≥ 65 
years groups were similar or somewhat lower in patients ≥ 65 years compared to those <65 years. 
The most frequent AEs (≥ 20% patients) in both age subgroups (<65 years and ≥ 65 years) were: 
pyrexia (65% and 52%), fatigue (46% and 49%), headache (42% and 26%), nausea (41% and 33%), 
chills (38% and 33%), diarrhoea (34% and 29%), vomiting (29% and 26%), and rash (25% and 
22%). In the placebo group, events were overall less frequently reported and were similar between the 
two age groups (87% vs 92%).  
In the dabrafenib+trametinib arm, the incidence of grade 3 /4 events was similar between the two age 
subgroups (<65 years, 40% and ≥ 65 years, 45%). In the placebo group, events were also similar 
between the two age subgroups (<65 years, 14% and ≥ 65 years, 21%). SAEs, AEs leading to dose 
reduction, AEs leading to dose interruption occurred at comparable rates between patients <65 years 
and ≥ 65 years in the D+T arm and the placebo arm (except for SAEs which occurred more often in 
placebo patients ≥ 65 compared to those <65 years). AEs leading to permanent discontinuation were 
seen more frequently in patients ≥ 65 years compared to those <65 years (33% vs 25%), while the 
rates were similar in the placebo arm.  
In Table 41 safety information by age group in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm is shown.

Table 41. Safety information by age group in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm 
A similar proportion of male and female patients in both treatment arms experienced at least one AE 
(dabrafenib+trametinib vs placebo: 96% vs 86% among male patients and 98% vs 90% among 
female patients). The most frequent (≥ 20% patients) AEs were comparable between genders. In the 
dabrafenib+trametinib arm the incidence of grade 3 /4 AEs was lower among male patients (34% 
grade 3 and 2% grade 4) than among female patients (44% grade 3 and 3% grade 4). In the placebo 
arm, a similar proportion of grade 3/4 events was observed among male (16% grade 3 and <1% 
grade 4) compared to female patients (11% grade 3 and no grade 4). 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuation were frequently observed in women (32% vs 22%) 
compared to men, as were AEs leading to dose reduction (45% vs 33%). Rates of SAEs (38 vs 33%) 
and AEs leading to dose interruption 64% vs 70% were more or less comparable between females and 
males. In the placebo arm all these rates were more or less comparable between males and females. 
No specific AEs or cluster of AEs could be identified underlying the male-female differences in the D+T 
arm.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported in 26% in the dabrafenib+trametinib 
arm and 3% in the placebo arm. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment 
in the D+T and placebo arm are shown in Table 42. In total 40% of the patients who discontinue due 
to AEs, do so within the first 3 months. From the patients who permanently discontinued due to AEs, 
there  were 71 patients  (62%)  with  Grade  1-2  AEs  versus  43  patients  (38%)  of  Grade 3-4  AEs  which 
led  to  discontinuation.  In  87%  of  the  patients  experiencing  any  AE  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation, a complete recovery/resolution of the event was observed and in 7 patients (6%) the 
AE  was  recovering/resolving  at  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off.  In  6  patients  (5%)  the  event  was  not 
recovered/resolved  and  resolved  with  sequelae  in  one  patient.  One  patient  died  due  to  pneumonia, 
which was not considered to be related to study treatment. RFS curves do not appear to be influenced 
by discontinuations.

The review of all new safety data and information obtained during the reporting interval of [Tafinlar 
PSUR 27Aug2016 to 26Aug2017] and [Mekinist PSUR 30Nov2016 to 29May2017] revealed no 
additional new safety signals. 
Safety in comparison to pooled data from previous indications 
The safety profile observed with dabrafenib+trametinib in the BRF115532 adjuvant study has been 
compared with that observed in the metastatic MEK115306 and MEK116513 phase III studies. A 
summary of AEs is shown in Table 43. 
The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation in adjuvant setting were pyrexia in 9% of 
patients  and  chills  in  4% of  patients;  while  in  the  metastatic  setting  were  pyrexia  (2%  and  3%)  and 
ejection fraction decreased (1% and 3%) in the MEK115306 and MEK116513 studies. 
The  proportion  of  AEs  leading  to  dose  reduction  was  similar  between  the  adjuvant  and  metastatic 
studies (38% and 31%, respectively). The proportion of AEs leading to dose interruption was slightly 
higher in the adjuvant setting (66%) as compared to the metastatic setting (55%).

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The D+T safety data is derived from the BRF115532 study in stage III melanoma patients in the 
adjuvant setting. The median follow up was 33-34 months, which is considered sufficient to assess the 
safety profile. The median average daily dose in current pivotal study was comparable between the 
two study arms, however, the cumulative dose was lower, while the duration of exposure was slightly 
longer in the D+T arm compared to the placebo arm, reflective of the dose reductions observed for 
D+T (discussed below) and disease progression in the placebo arm. Around two thirds of the patients 
in the D+T arm received at least 9 months of treatment. 
In general, the toxicity profile of D+T in adjuvant melanoma setting is comparable to the known safety 
profile from studies in metastatic melanoma setting In the D+T arm, higher frequencies of AEs were 
observed compared to the placebo arm (97 vs 88%). Pyrexia was the most common AE, other AEs 
occurring in ≥30% of the patients in the D+T arm were fatigue, nausea, headache, chills and 
diarrhoea, all of which occurred more frequently compared to the placebo arm. Reported frequencies of 
these AEs were slightly higher in the adjuvant setting compared to the metastatic melanoma setting 
which could be due to differences in exposure between the two settings. Also a higher reporting AEs in 
the adjuvant versus the metastatic (melanoma) setting has previously been described in the literature 
(Eggermont 2015), thus the observed differences are not considered clinically relevant. The most 
frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs in the D+T arm were hypertension, pyrexia and fatigue, in the 
placebo arm Grade 3/4 AEs were not frequent (overall Grade 3-4 AEs respectively 41% vs 14%). 
Compared to the metastatic setting the overall number of Grade 3-4 AEs was slightly lower in the 
adjuvant setting (respectively 50 vs 41%), which might be expected as current population are 
expected to have less disease-related morbidity.

The MAH updated the frequencies of the ADRs based on adverse reactions reported in the integrated 
safety  population  of  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  in  the  studies  MEK115306, 
MEK116513a, BRF113928, and BRF115532 (n=1076)(n=641). Several ADRs changed frequency, most 
notably  “urinary  tract  infection”  changed  from  “very  common”  to  “common”,  renal  failure  changed 
from  “common”  to  “uncommon”,  influenza-like  illness  changed  from”very  common”  to  “common”, 
uveitis  from  “uncommon”  to  “common”,  pneumonitis  from  “common”  to  “uncommon”  and 
gastrointestinal perforation from “uncommon” to “rare”. 
Serious adverse events including deaths 
SAEs frequently occurred in the D+T arm as 36% of the patients had at least one SAE in the D+T arm. 
In 25% of the patients in the D+T arm a SAE lead to hospitalization. Few patients experienced 2 or 3 
or more SAEs. A considerable part of the total SAEs are Grade 1-2 AEs and thus even non-severe AEs 
have some impact on patients life. Almost all patients appear to recover from SAEs (94%). Few SAEs 
were  seen  in  the  placebo  arm  (10%).  Most  frequent  SAEs  in  the  D+T  arm  were  pyrexia,  chills  and 
decreased ejection fraction. This is consistent with the known safety profile of D+T.  
Deaths  were  more  frequently  observed  in  the  placebo  arm  compared  to  the  D+T  arm.  Most  deaths 
were related to disease progression. Four patients in the D+T arm versus 1 patient in the placebo arm 
died  within  30  days  of  study  treatment,  all  but one due  to  disease  progression.  This  one  patient  was 
randomised to the D+T arm and died due to an untreated pneumonia. Fatal SAEs were less frequently 
observed  for  D+T  in  the  adjuvant  melanoma  setting  compared  to  the  metastatic  melanoma  setting 
(see bleeding events below). 
Adverse  events  leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  or  dose  interruption/delay  or 
reduction 
A  considerable  part  of  the  patients  permanently  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs  in  the  D+T  arm 
(26%  vs  3%  in  the  placebo  arm).  The  most  common  AEs  in  the  D+T  arm  leading  to  discontinuation 
were  pyrexia  (9%),  chills  (4%)  and  fatigue  (2%).  A  considerable  number  of  D+T  treated  patient 
discontinued  due  to  AEs  within  the  first  three  months.  Further,  most  of  the  AEs  which  led  to 
discontinuation in this arm were low grade (Grade 1-2). Pyrexia, chills and fatigue were also the most 
common  AEs  leading  to  dose  reduction  and  interruptions.  Dose  reduction  due  to  AEs  was  reported 
frequently in the D+T arm (38% vs 3% in the placebo arm). Similar to the discontinuations, most dose 
reductions due to AEs occurred within the first three months and the reductions were mostly related to 
Grade 1-2 AEs. Overall, these data confirm the moderate tolerability of the D+T treatment. Also dose 
interruptions  due  to  AEs  were  often  observed;  in  66%  of  the  patients  in  the  D+T  arm  compared  to 
15% in the placebo arm. AEs leading to permanent discontinuation and dose interruptions/reductions 
were  seen  more  often  in  the  adjuvant  setting  compared  to  the  metastatic  setting.  Since  the  AEs  are 
considered manageable, this does not cause any particular concerns.

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  
All  AESIs  were  observed  more  frequently  in  the  D+T  arm  compared  to  placebo.  Almost  all  AESIs 
resolved  in  the  D+T  arm,  exceptions  were  hyperglycaemia  (67%  resolved),  hypertension  (77% 
resolved) and ocular events (87% resolved). These AEs are sufficiently covered in the SmPC. More or 
less comparable rates of resolving of AEs were observed in the placebo arm, though in the placebo arm 
in  concerned  fewer  patients.  Most  AESIs  occurred  in  similar  frequencies  as  already  observed  from 
metastatic melanoma patients, except for skin-related toxicities (mostly rash), which occurred in 63% 
of patients in the D+T arm (39% in the placebo arm) and in the metastatic setting in 45-48% of the 
D+T  treated  patients.  Most  skin-related  events  reported  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  and  had  little 
influence  on  dosing.  The  current  SmPC  adequately  covers  skin-related  toxicities;  Rash  has  been 
observed  in  about  60%  of  patients  in  trametinib  monotherapy  studies  and  in  about  24%  of  patients 
when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). 
One of the more challenging AEs described with D+T therapy is pyrexia. Pyrexia occurred much more 
frequent in the D+T arm (67% vs 15%), though Grade 3-4 events was much less frequent overall and 
the  difference  between  the  2  study  arms  was  smaller(8%  vs  3%  respectively).  More  than  half  of  the 
patient  experienced  three  or  more  episodes  in  the  D+T  arm,  whereas  in  the  placebo  arm  patients 
generally  experienced  only  1  episode.  Pyrexia  was  also  a  common  cause  for  dose  modifications, 
interruptions  in  the  D+T  arm,  confirming  the  difficulties  in  management  of  this  AE,  however  99%  of 
the  cases  in  the  current  study  eventually  resolved  without  sequelae.  The  SmPC  adequately  covers 
dosing advices related to pyrexia. 
In  prior  studies  of  the  D+T  combination  in  metastatic  setting  6  fatal  bleedings  were  observed  in  the 
D+T  arms,  to  which  a  contribution  of  the  D+T  therapy  could  not  be  ruled  out.  In  this  study  no  fatal 
bleeding event were observed, all but one (Grade 3 SAE) of the bleeding events were Grade 1-2. The 
current SmPC warning is still considered warranted due to observations in previous studies. 
LVEF decreases were frequently observed, as is expected from the known safety profile of D+T. Most 
decreases  in  the  D+T  arm  deviated  less  than  10%  from  baseline  and  few  patients  with  a  LVEF 
decrease of ≥20% or with a decrease ≥10% resulting in an ejection fraction below the lower limit of 
normal  were  reported.  The  latter  two  AEs  were  more  or  less  balanced  between  the  study  arms.  This 
issue is considered sufficiently covered by current SmPC.  
Relating to concerns of an increased risk of development of secondary malignancies by the paradoxical 
stimulation of the MAPK pathway by BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors; CuSCC rates in the D+T arm were low 
and comparable to placebo (6 vs 5 patients), however it should be noted that CuSCC occurred earlier 
in  the  D+T  arm  (median  18  vs  33  weeks).  In  the  placebo  arm  more  new  melanomas  were  observed 
compared  to  D+T  arm  (6  vs  1  patient).  This  might  even  support  a  protective  mechanism  for  the 
experimental arm. Non-cutaneous treatment-emergent malignancies were numerically more frequently 
seen  in  the  D+T  compared  to  the  placebo  arm  (5  vs  3  patients).  The  long  term  risk  regarding 
development  of  non-cutaneous  malignancies  is  still  unclear.  CuScc,  new  melanomas  and  new  non-
cutaneous  malignancies  are  important  identified  risks  for  dabrafenib  and  are  appropriately 
communicated through current labelling and already part of the pharmacovigilance plan for dabrafenib, 
hence no new measures are required. 
Haemorrhagic  events,  including  major  haemorrhagic  events  and  fatal  haemorrhages,  occurred  in 
patients taking trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib in the unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma Phase III studies and NSCLC Phase II study (see SmPC section 4.8).

Special populations: AEs were generally occurred at comparable or numerically lower rates in patients 
of  65  years  and  older  compared  to  those  younger  than  65.  However,  AEs  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation  were  observed  more  frequently  in  those  of  65  years  and  older  compared  to  those 
younger than 65 years. The SmPC already contains a warning relating to this subject. 
A similar proportion of male and female patients in both treatment arms experienced at least one AE, 
however women experienced more (difference≥10%) Grade 3-4 AEs, more AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation or dose reductions. No specific AE or cluster of AEs could be identified as an underlying 
cause of these differences. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns were identified in the current pivotal study for adjuvant treatment of stage III 
melanoma patients. The safety profile appears similar to the known profile in metastatic melanoma 
patients, however compared to the metastatic setting less severe AEs and fatal AEs were observed. It 
may be noted that with dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, 
discontinuations and dose reductions due to AEs occur frequent. Discontinuations and dose reduction 
were observed early on during the treatment and are often related to low grade AEs, which underlines 
the toxicity associated with this regimen. Almost all AESI, SAEs and AEs which lead to discontinuation 
eventually resolved. The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated and no new risk minimisation activities 
are considered necessary (please see RMP). 
2.4.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9.1 for Tafinlar and 14.1 for Mekinist is 
acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 9.1 for Tafinlar and 14.1 for Mekinist with the

No changes to the risk minimisation measures for either Mekinist or Tafinlar have been introduced 
as part of this extension of indication.  
Routine risk minimisation measures remains sufficient to manage the safety concerns of both 
medicinal products. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria and Lithuania. 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the 
changes are considered minor and do not impact the readability of the PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib for the 
adjuvant treatment of adult patients with Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following 
complete resection. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Melanoma is a malignant tumour that originates from melanocytic cells and primarily involves the skin. 
Using the 8th edition of the AJCC classification, 5-year melanoma-specific survival rate ranges from 
93% in stage IIIA to 32% in stage IIID. 
In melanoma, different activating mutations have been described, mainly resulting in an increased 
signalling of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)-pathway leading to cell proliferation. About 
45% of patients with cutaneous melanoma carry an activating BRAF V600 mutation. 
For locoregional advanced melanomas, surgery alone is standard of care, including resection of 
satellite or in-transit metastases and regional lymph node dissections once tumour-positive nodes have 
been detected. However, prognosis for patients with high risk melanoma remains poor with 5-year 
survival rates of 40 to 80%. Therefore, there is a need for additional adjuvant therapy options. 
Assessment report  
EMA/550929/2018

Interferon alpha has been approved for the adjuvant treatment for melanoma in the EU, however due 
to concerns regarding toxicity, it is currently not standard of care in the EU. Recently nivolumab has 
been approved. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  application  is  supported  by  one  pivotal  study,  a  randomised,  double-blind  phase  III  study  to 
evaluate  the  combination  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  versus  placebo  as  adjuvant  treatment  for  1 
year  in  stage  III  BRAF  V600E/K  mutant  melanoma  after  surgical  resection.  870  patients  were 
randomised 1:1 with stratification by BRAF status and disease stage. Staging of the study population 
was based on the previous 7th AJCC edition. Given that stage III contains patients with metastases in 
regional lymph nodes and non-nodal locoregional sites and without distant metastases in both the 7th 
and 8th edition, this is not likely to influence the results. The primary efficacy endpoint was RFS; OS 
was  a  key  secondary  endpoint.  Other  efficacy  endpoints  were  DMFS  (secondary),  FFR  (secondary), 
HRQOL  (using  EQ-5D;  exploratory),  ECOG  PS  (exploratory),  PK  (exploratory)  and  biomolecular 
analysis (exploratory). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study BRF115532 met its primary endpoint demonstrating superiority of the treatment arm for 
RFS with HR 0.47 (95%CI 0.39-0.58; p=1.53x10-14). Median time to reach RFS was 16.6 months in 
the placebo arm (95%CI 12.7-22.1) and not reached in the treatment arm (95%CI 44.5-NE) with the 
primary DBL of 30-Jun-2017. An additional DBL at 30-Apr-2018 with an extra 10 months of follow-up 
showed consistent results with HR 0.49 (95%CI 0.40-0.59). Compared to the primary RFS analysis 17 
additional RFS events were recorded (11 in dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 6 in placebo arm). Median 
follow-up was 44 months in the dabrafenib+trametinib group and 42 months in the placebo group. 
When looking at the RFS Kaplan-Meier curves separation of the curves is visible after the first 
assessment on study in favour of dabrafenib+trametinib. The curves are interpretable until ~38 
months, which is, given that most recurrences occur <3 years, considered sufficient. With the 
additional follow-up the curve in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm leads to a plateau, indicating that 
some patients may be cured. At 3 years the difference in RFS rate was 19%. 
Support that the RFS data are mature is provided by the event and censoring rates. The number of 
events after 36 months is low in both arms and seems to stabilise. 
Sensitivity analyses were all supporting the efficacy of the dabrafenib+trametinib arm. Most subgroup 
analyses showed a favourable HR in favour of the treatment arm, including for known prognostic 
factors such as disease stage, nodal status and ulceration. 
The first interim analysis for OS was based on in total 153 deaths (26% of the total targeted deaths 
required for final analysis). The number of events was 60 (14%) in the dabrafenib+trametinib arm and 
93 (22%) in the placebo arm. Median OS was not reached in either arm. HR was 0.57 (95%CI 0.42-
0.79) and the threshold for significance was not reached. 
Though immature, other secondary endpoints (DMFS and FFR) are considered supportive for the RFS 
results. 
There were no statistically significant differences in HRQoL measures between the two arms and during 
the study changes from baseline were minimal. Changes in ECOG performance scale were also similar 
between the two groups.

The provided PK data in this variation support that exposure to dabrafenib and its active metabolites, 
as well as exposure to trametinib, with dabrafenib given at a dose of 150 mg twice daily and 
trametinib as 2 mg once daily, in the adjuvant melanoma setting is comparable to that in the 
metastatic melanoma setting. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Secondary endpoint OS- OS data of 24-27 months are still immature. Therefore, the MAH is 
requested to submit the final OS study results from study BRF115532. This has been included as part 
of an Annex II condition. 
Exploratory endpoints- In addition, results from an exploratory endpoint for biomarkers analyses 
have not been provided. Biomarkers could aid in the detection and follow-up of residual disease during 
and after treatment. Moreover, biomarkers could possibly be used for dose refinement. For circulating 
free (cf)DNA the predictive value is already shown in the metastatic setting10 . Currently the 
mutational and gene expression profiling data are being analysed in relapsed patients. The CHMP 
recommends the submission of the results from the biomarker analysis in tissues and plasma. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, the AEs of dabrafenib plus trametinib in the current study were comparable to the known 
safety profile from metastatic melanoma and advanced NSCLC patients. The most common adverse 
reactions (incidence ≥20%) for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib were: pyrexia, fatigue, 
nausea, chills, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, arthralgia and rash. Grade 3/4 AEs were also more 
frequent in the D+T arm compared to placebo (41 vs 14%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs in the 
D+T arm were hypertension, pyrexia and fatigue. 
Over one third of the patients (36%) in the D+T arm experienced SAEs. The most frequently reported 
SAEs were pyrexia (15%), chills (3%) and decreased ejection fraction (3%) in the D+T arm. In the 
placebo arm, SAEs occurred infrequently. Five deaths occurred within 30 days from last dose, four 
were due to disease progression and one death in the D+T arm was due to an untreated pneumonia 
and was deemed unrelated to the treatment. In prior D+T studies in metastatic melanoma, 6 patients 
with fatal bleedings were observed, possibly related to D+T. In this study, no fatal bleeding events 
were observed and almost all bleeding events were Grade 1-2. 
Dose reductions/dose interruptions and discontinuations of D+T, most often related to pyrexia, chills 
and fatigue, at higher frequencies compared to both placebo and the metastatic melanoma setting. 
Permanent discontinuations occurred in about a quarter of the patients. Most discontinuations and 
dose reductions due to AEs occurred within the first three months and were related to Grade 1-2 AEs. 
CuSCC rates in the D+T arm were low and comparable to the placebo, however the median time to 
onset was earlier in the D+T arm (median 18 vs 33 weeks). Non-cutaneous treatment-emergent 
malignancies were reported numerically more frequent and new primary melanomas numerically less 
frequent in the D+T arm compared to the placebo arm. 
A similar proportion of male and female patients in both treatment arms experienced at least one AE, 
however women experienced more Grade 3-4 AEs (Grade 3: 44% vs 34%; Grade 4: 3% vs 2%), more

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Melanoma  is  the  most  serious  form  of  skin  cancer  and  currently  no  standard  adjuvant  therapy  after 
surgery  is  given  in  the  EU.  Interferon  alpha  is  an  approved  treatment  option,  but  its  use  is  limited 
because  of  its  high  toxicity.  In  addition,  the  benefit  of  interferon  in  BRAF  mutated  patients  remains 
unclear. Therefore, there is a need for additional adjuvant therapy options in stage III melanoma. The 
combination  of  dabrafenib+trametinib  shows  a  significant  and  relevant  increase  in  RFS  compared  to 
placebo.  The  RFS  efficacy  results  are  supported  by  a  favourable  trend  in  OS  and  support  from 
secondary  endpoints,  DMFS,  and  FFR  in  favour  of  dabrafenib+trametinib as  well  as  consistent  results 
in the subgroup analyses. The MAH provided updated RFS results which show that the RFS benefit was 
maintained over a longer period of time and it also increases the cure rate. Since most relapses tend 
to occur within 3 years in this patient population, the 38 months follow up data is reliable enough to 
provide  a  clear  demonstration  of  a  plateau  with  an  estimated  3-year  difference  in  RFS  of  19% 
compared to placebo accompanied by a decreasing event rate.  
An update of OS analysis within this procedure is not likely to provide more information given the low 
number of events.  
No new safety concerns were identified in the current pivotal study for adjuvant treatment of stage III 
melanoma  patients.  In  general,  the  safety  and  tolerability  appear  similar to  what  has  been  described 
for  metastatic  melanoma  patients  however  compared  to  the  metastatic  setting  less  severe  AEs  and 
fatal  AEs  were  observed.  Nonetheless,  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy  is  associated 
with  considerable  toxicity  as  Grade  3-4  AEs,  SAEs,  dose  reductions  and  permanent  discontinuations 
due to AEs occur relatively frequent. The latter two occur relatively early on during the treatment and 
are  often  related  to  low  grade  AEs.  It  is  reassuring  is  that  almost  all  ADRs  which  lead  to 
discontinuation  eventually  resolve.  No  new  safety measures  are  considered necessary  for  this  patient 
population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
It  has  been  shown  that  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  stage  III  melanoma  with  dabrafenib+trametinib 
leads  to  a  prolonged  RFS  benefit  as  well  as  an  increased  cure  rate.  The  results  outweigh  the  toxicity 
observed with the combination treatment. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
It  was  noted  that  patients  with  lower  risk  melanoma,  i.e.  stage  IIIA  with  lymph  node  metastasis  <1 
mm  were  not  included  in  the  study  population.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  that  these  patients 
would  not  also  derive  clinical  benefit.  Therefore,  the  indication  includes  all  stage  III  patients  with 
cutaneous  melanoma.  Moreover,  patients  were  recruited  with  cutaneous  melanoma  with  a  V600E/K 
mutation. It is well known that over 90% of mutations at position 600 are a substitution of the amino 
acid  valine  (V)  to  a  glutamic  acid  (E)  but  other  substitutions  can  also  occur  such  as  V600-D-R. 
Dabrafenib  has  shown  inhibitory  activity  against  some  of  these  other  mutations  and  trametinib  will 
inhibit downstream MEK activity, hence, likewise for the metastatic setting, there is sufficient evidence 
to  be  able  to  extrapolate  the  indication  to  melanoma  patients  with  tumours  harbouring  V600 
mutations.

The overall B/R of the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist is positive for the adjuvant treatment of 
adult patients with stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection.

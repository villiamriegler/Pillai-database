2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The applicant is seeking marketing authorisation for the proposed medicinal product Lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride non carrier added (n.c.a.), solution in accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended, based on the well-established medicinal use of the active substance lutetium-177 chloride as 
medicinal product for at least 10 years in the EU.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed medicinal product Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., solution is a radiopharmaceutical 
precursor, and not intended for direct use in patients. It is to be used only for radiolabelling of carrier 
molecules that have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride.

Radionuclides have widely been used in medical applications such as diagnostic radiology for decades, 
with the first radiopharmaceuticals commercialised in 1950. For example, tumours as well as 
metastases can be localised by radionuclide-tracer-complexes specifically targeting tumour-tissue, 
such as prostate-specific membrane-antigen (PSMA) or somatostatin-analogues (Sgouros G, 2020). 
Apart from being utilised for diagnostic imaging, radionuclide-tracer-complexes are also increasingly 
used in molecular radiotherapy.  
2.2.  About the product 
Lutetium belongs to the group of lanthanides and is a rare earth metal. One of its isotopes is lutetium-
177 emitting medium-energy β-particles with a maximum energy of 0.5 MeV (mean energy 47.66 to 
149.35 KeV) and a maximum tissue penetration of 2 mm.  
The proposed medicinal product Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., solution is a radiopharmaceutical 
precursor preparation of high purity intended only for the in vitro labelling of tracer molecules 
specifically developed for radiolabelling. Following radiolabelling of the radiopharmaceutical precursor, 
the tracer molecules (e.g., peptides or monoclonal antibodies) will be administered by the approved 
route for targeting a specific site (e.g. solid tumour) thereby allowing local irradiation. Lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride n.c.a. is not intended for direct administration to patients. 
Lutetium-177 has a half-life of approximately 6.7 days. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a. is produced by 
neutron irradiation of enriched ytterbium (176Yb). Lutetium-177 decays by β-emission to stable hafnium 
(177Hf), with the most abundant β-emission (79.3%) having a maximum energy of 497 keV. Also, low 
gamma energy is emitted, for instance at 113 keV (6.2%) and 208 keV (11%). 
The pharmacodynamic properties of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by 
radiolabelling with ilLuzyce, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled.  
The tracer molecule will direct the radionuclide Lutetium-177 to the tumour tissue where it will bind to 
surface molecules expressed specifically by tumour cells. Upon binding, the receptor-ligand complexes 
become internalised. Once intracellular, internalised 177Lu-labelled radioligands accumulate in the 
perinuclear area allowing direct DNA damage by ionising radiation resulting in cell death. Lutetium 
(177Lu) emits β-minus particles of moderate maximum energy (0.498 MeV) with a maximum tissue 
penetration of approximately 2 mm. Lutetium (177Lu) also emits low-energy γ-rays which allow 
scintigraphic, biodistribution and dosimetry studies with the same lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products. 
The applied and recommended indication is as follows: ilLuzyce is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and 
it is not intended for direct use in patients. It is to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier 
molecules that have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride (see SmPC section 4.1). 
ilLuzyce is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling (see SmPC section 
4.2).  
The quantity of the proposed medicinal product required for radiolabelling and the quantity of lutetium 
(177Lu)-labelled medicinal product subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product 
radiolabelled and its intended use (see SmPC section 4.2).

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended – relating to applications relying on well-established 
medicinal use supported by bibliographic literature. According to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
and without prejudice to the law relating to the protection of industrial and commercial property, it is 
possible for an applicant to replace results of pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed references to 
published scientific literature (information available in the public domain) if it can be demonstrated that 
the active substance of a medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal use within the 
Union for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In this regard, 
the provisions of Annex I (Part II.1) to Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply. The applicant has submitted a 
document to support the application as a well-established use where the fulfilment of the requirements 
of article 10a application are discussed. 
It bears noting that, as applicable for all applications for marketing authorisation, the applicant 
declared that the data submitted are not subject to regulatory data exclusivity in the Union. 
To determine if the application fulfils the requirements of Article 10a with regard to well-established 
medicinal use of lutetium (177Lu) chloride non-carrier-added (n.c.a.), a radiopharmaceutical precursor 
not intended for direct use in patients, the CHMP took into account the following factors: 
•  Time over which the substance has been used: 
Lutetium has been used in the treatment of NETs since 2000. Due to its favourable radiochemical 
characteristics compared to other radionuclides such as yttrium- 90, lutetium-177 is widely established 
in clinical radiotherapy in conjunction with molecular tracers, mainly targeting somatostatin receptors 
(SSTRs) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Quantitatively, lutetium has been shown to 
be widely used in studies and also in supply data from the applicant. 
•  Quantitative aspects of use of the substance: 
According to the information provided in publicly available study data, at least about 4,000 patients 
have been treated with 177Lu-labelled tracers in the course of published clinical trials so far. 
Considering a dose of 1-4 cycles per patient, about 4,000-16,000 doses of lutetium-177 have at least 
been applied in the course of published clinical trials only. Given the fact that several medicinal 
products containing the radionuclide lutetium-177 have been authorised during the past 7 years and 
are therefore considered established in clinical practice, and many patients are treated on a named- 
patient or compassionate use basis, a much higher number of patients treated with 177Lu-labelled 
tracers must be assumed.  
Altogether, the use of 177Lu-labelled compounds in specific radiotherapy is widely distributed throughout 
the EU as well as worldwide as documented by various published clinical studies and current treatment 
guidelines.  Furthermore,  several  medicinal  products  intended  for  radiolabelling  containing  the  active 
substance  177LuCl3 were authorised in and outside the EU during the past years.  Clinical utility of the 
radiopharmaceutical precursor 177LuCl3 can be considered well-established.

•  Degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published 
scientific literature): 
An  initial  PubMed  search  in  February  2021  using  the  terms  “lutetium”  OR  “lutetium-177”  OR  “177Lu” 
revealed  about  3000  hits,  including  all  articles  without  any  limitation.  After  evaluation  of  all  public 
sources,  178  references  were  included  in  the  clinical  overview  presented  by  the  applicant.  There  is 
continued scientific interest in lutetium, with continuous publications in the EU for about 20 years. The 
first clinical use of 177Lu-labelled tracers in the EU was described for 177Lu-DOTATATE and 177Lu-DOTATOC 
in  2003  and  2005/2006,  respectively.  Since  then,  numerous  publications  have  followed.  There  is 
continued scientific interest in the use of the active substance 177LuCl3 documented by an increasing total 
number of publications listed in PubMed (including clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and 
reviews) during the last two decades as shown in the figure below.

•  Coherence of scientific assessments: 
As per Annex 1, Part III, point 2.2 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended in Directive 2003/63/EC, Annex 
I: 
“Clinical  information  generated  from  clinical  studies  using  the  precursor  itself  is  not  considered  to  be 
relevant  in  the  specific  case  of  a  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  intended  solely  for  radiolabelling 
purposes. However, information demonstrating the clinical utility of the radio-pharmaceutical precursor 
when attached to relevant carrier molecules shall be presented”. 
The efficacy and safety characteristics of lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a depend on the carrier 
molecule, which is radiolabelled with the proposed medicinal product. Therefore, no clinical studies 
investigating the efficacy and safety of the proposed medicinal product have been conducted by the 
applicant.  
Therefore, according to the requirements to substantiate the well-established medicinal use of the active 
substance as medicinal product for at least 10 years in the Community as set out in Annex 1 Part III of 
Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  the  applicant  presented  comprehensive  efficacy  and  safety  data 
from published clinical trials, which have been conducted with 177Lu-labelled tracer molecules, focussing 
mainly  on  the  most  established  carriers  used  for  radionuclide  therapy  targeting  different  types  of 
carcinoid tumours such as neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) or prostate cancer (PCa). 
The comprehensive body of data and discussion by the applicant fulfilled the requirements of the well-
established use legal basis.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is a radiopharmaceutical precursor presented in sterile diluted hydrochloric acid. 1 
mL of solution contains 51.8 GBq Lutetium(177Lu) chloride on activity reference time (ART) 
corresponding to maximum 12.6 micrograms of Lutetium (177Lu) (as chloride) as active substance. 
The ART is defined as the end of production. The minimal specific activity is 3000 GBq/mg lutetium 
(177Lu) at the ART. 
Each 5 mL vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 mL to 4 mL corresponding to an activity ranging 
from 5.2 to 207.2 GBq at ART. 
Each 10 mL vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 mL to 8 mL corresponding to an activity ranging 
from 5.2 to 414.4 GBq at ART. 
The activity at the date and time ordered by the customer, indicated as CAL (calibration), is 
determined by the time elapsed from the ART and the half-life of Llutetium (177Lu). 
The other ingredient is hydrochloric acid, diluted 
The product is available in 5 mL or 10 mL clear type I glass vial either conical or flat bottom, 
respectively, with a teflon coated chlorobutyl rubber stopper, closed with an aluminium cap as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The vials are placed into a lead container for protective shielding 
and packed into a polystyrene box and an outer carton 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of active substance is lutetium-177(3+); trichloride corresponding to the molecular 
formula LuCl3. It has a relative molecular mass of 283.3 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 2. Active substance structure 
Lu-177’s gamma radiation is characterised by two main energies; 11% of Lu-177 decay is in the 
energy of 208 KeV and 6.4% is in the energy of 112 KeV. The measured spectrum of the active 
substance shows the presence of the two main 2 Gamma energies (112 and 208 keV) together with 
some other typical emission peaks known to be present, in lesser intensities, in Lu-177 gamma ray 
spectrum, thus the identity of the active substance is assured.

The active substance is presented as a clear colourless solution. The solubility of Lu3+ in aqueous 
solution is pH dependent. Lutetium chloride is very soluble in diluted hydrochloric acid solution. 
Other properties relevant considering the radioactive nature of the active substance and its intended 
use are provided: decay mode and radiation emitted by the radionuclide and non carrier added (n.c.a.) 
qualification derived from the route of production that yields a high specific activity preparation. 
Lu-177 is a radioactive isotope that decays to Hf-177 with a half-life of 6.647 days and emits 
β-particles with maximum energies of 497 keV, 385 keV and 176 keV and low energy gamma photons 
of 113 keV and 208 keV. The moderate energy beta emission of 177Lu is effective in destroying small 
tumours and metastatic lesions (typically less than 3 mm diameter) while sparing the surrounding 
normal tissue. The emission of low-energy gamma photons [Ec = 113 keV (6.6 %), 208 keV (11 %)] 
enable imaging and therapy with the same radiolabelled preparation and allow dosimetry to be 
performed before and during treatment. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site.  
The manufacturing process covers all the operations that are required according to the guideline on 
radiopharmaceuticals. The active substance is synthesised in 3 main steps.  
Natural ytterbium is enriched in Yb-176 by electromagnetic isotope separation, removed from the 
copper plate of the receiver, purified of unwanted chemical elements by precipitation and transformed 
into ytterbium oxide, the chemical form suitable for irradiation. The enriched ytterbium oxide is packed 
in sealed quartz tubes that are sent to a nuclear reactor for neutron irradiation. After irradiation, the 
target is cooled down to allow the Yb-177 decay to Lu-177. The nuclear reaction that occurs during 
irradiation in the nuclear reactor is: 
Afterwards, the purification and formulation of Lu-177 is done in a continuous automated process 
conducted in a synthesis module. In a chromatographic process, the accumulated Lutetium (177Lu) is 
separated chemically from the original target material and is dissolved in 0.04 M HCl. 
The manufacturing process is continuous and highly automated and there are no intermediates. 
Adequate in-process controls are performed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances and the guideline on radiopharmaceuticals. 
Considering the production route of Lu-177 and the level of enrichment of ytterbium in the target, the 
only expected relevant radionuclidic impurity is Yb-175. The discussion on the control of potential 
metallic impurities is also provided and considered satisfactory. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterisation. 
The active substance is packaged in clear type I glass vials. The vial used to collect the bulk solution, is 
plugged with a teflon coated rubber stopper which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance is not isolated. The active substance bulk solution proceeds to filling and 
sterilising steps to produce the finished product. Considering the similarity between the active 
substance and the finished product and the continuous nature of the manufacturing process, and in 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 14/68 
 
 
 
 
line with the guideline on radiopharmaceuticals, it is acceptable that the quality control testing is done 
mainly at the finished product stage. 
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
As mentioned above, the active substance is not isolated, so the stability of the active substance 
corresponds to the stability of the finished product. For stability studies and data, reference is made to 
the section on stability of the finished product. A re-test period for the active substance is not 
proposed. This is deemed acceptable because the manufacturing process is a continuous process 
starting from the beginning of the target processing and the active substance is not isolated or stored. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a clear colourless solution. 
During the evaluation, the CHMP requested, as Major Objection (MO), that the activity per mL of the 
finished product at activity reference time should be fixed as required in the “Guideline on 
Radiopharmaceuticals (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007). The activity was fixed to 51.8 GBq/ml and it 
was considered satisfactory. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a sterile finished product with a low 
content of metallic impurities according to current edition of the Ph. Eur. Lutetium (177Lu) Solution for 
Radiolabelling. 
The product is intended for use as a radioactive precursor in the preparation of several radio labelled 
peptides, used for radionuclide therapy. The finished  product is not intended for direct use in patients. 
The active substance is a synthetic radionuclide (177Lu) produced by neutron bombardment of 
Ytterbium 176 (176Yb). This radionuclide (177Lu) is a non-fission product. The 177Lu produced by this 
method is of high specific activity since the target material, enriched 176Yb, is chemically different from 
the radioisotope produced and the sole source of stable Lu isotope is the decay of 175Yb, produced 
during the neutron irradiation of the target material, to 175Lu. An advantage of this process is avoiding 
production of the long-lived radionuclide impurity 177mLu. 
Hydrochloric acid solution is used as solvent for the active substance. The rationale for selection of this 
solvent is that dilute hydrochloric acid is used in the Ph. Eur monograph Lutetium (177Lu) solution for 
radiolabelling and the pH requirement are pH 1.0 to 2.0. This excipient is  well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in 
the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
An important parameter for the quality of the radiopharmaceutical product is the radiolabeling yield. To 
achieve a high yield of the subsequent labelling reactions even traces of metals should be avoided 
when choosing the excipients. Therefore, only excipients and reagents of high purity are used. 
Manufacture is a continuous process from the irradiated starting material through to manufacture of 
the finished product. 
The product (Lu-177 chloride solution) can be sterilised by steam sterilisation at a temperature 
≥121°C for ≥15 minutes and therefore the finished product is terminally sterilised by autoclaving 
according to Ph. Eur 5.1.1 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 15/68 
 
 
 
The primary packaging is a clear type I glass vial of 5 mL or 10 mL either conical or flat bottom, 
respectively, with a Teflon coated chlorobutyl rubber stopper, closed with an aluminium cap. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Regarding the 
primary packaging, the material of the container and closure system are commonly used for this type 
of products. Compatibility of the radiolabelled product with the container and closure is discussed, 
including the potential release of metallic impurities from the stopper. A self-sealing test of the rubber 
stopper has been conducted to support the eventual use of the finished product as a multi-dose 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site.   
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps: dispensing of bulk solution, steam sterilization and 
secondary  packaging  for  shipment.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing 
process. 
The manufacture of the finished product consists in the filling of the finished product vials with the 
amount of bulk solution ordered by the clients, the terminal sterilisation in an autoclave, labelling and 
final secondary packaging. The dispensing process is done in a dispensing programmed robot for 
dispensing the calculated volumes into each vial; the activity of each vial is measured after vial closing 
before sterilisation and again after sterilisation just before final labelling of the lead shield. The 
sterilisation cycle is stated. 
The validation of the manufacturing process covers the manufacture of both the active substance and 
the finished product and this is considered acceptable considering the nature of the process. The 
validation has been conducted on three batches representative of the proposed manufacturing process 
and includes suitable data: batch results of validation batches, results of in process controls, 
manufacturing parameters and additional validation tests. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include all the tests prescribed by the Ph. Eur. monograph #2798 on 
Lutetium (177Lu) solution for radiolabelling and include additional limits for the content of ytterbium-176 
and for specific activity. The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind 
of dosage form appearance (visual), pH (colorimetry), identification (Gamma spectroscopy, pH, iTLC), 
specific  activity  (ICP-OES),  radioactive  concentration  of  Lutetium  (177Lu)  chloride  (Dose  calibrator), 
chemical  purity  (ICP-OES),  radionuclidic  purity  (gamma  spectrometry),  radiochemical  purity  (iTLC), 
bacterial endotoxins (BET), and sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
Regarding the characterisation of impurities, a discussion on metallic impurities on the limit for 
ytterbium content and on potential impurities originating from the resins have been provided and 
considered satisfactory. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 16/68 
 
 
 
on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided representative of the proposed manufacturing process confirming 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three development batches and three routine production batches (upright and inverted 
position) of finished product stored for up to 11 days under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) as 
well as at accelerated temperature (40 ºC ± 2 ºC/ 75% RH ± 5%) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The production batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for:  appearance,  identification,  pH,  chemical  purity,  radionuclidic  purity, 
radiochemical  purity,  bacterial  endotoxins,  and  sterility.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability 
indicating. All results are within specifications and significant trends are not seen 
Sterility  test  is  performed  after  decay  which  means  after  10  to  12  weeks  from  time  zero  and  it  has 
thereby been shown that the results are within specification at end of shelf life. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of up to 11 days from the date of manufacture 
and none storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of withdrawal from the vial or any insertion 
into the vial preclude the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If 
not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
One issue was raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO) related to the expression of activity of the 
finished product at activity reference time should be fixed. The issues were resolved satisfactorily by 
the applicant as discussed above.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is not intended to be administered directly to the patient. As a precursor it 
should only be used for in vitro labelling of appropriate carrier molecules for targeted radiotherapy. 
Accordingly, it has no primary pharmacodynamic function and only very few data are available on the 
general pharmacodynamics of lutetium as a metal ion and as a free soluble radioactive metal salt. 
The studies and data assessed in this application are based on scientific literature in accordance with 
the published legal basis. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
First reports on the medical use of 177Lu were published in 1969, describing the use of this radioactive 
element for bone imaging in rabbits (O'Mara, 1969). Whereas 177Lu is currently used as a targeted 
radiotherapeutic due to the emission of β-radiation with a range of only 2 mm compared to the range 
of 12 mm described for 90Y, 177Lu also emits γ-irradiation, enabling its use for radio-imaging purposes 
(Kam, 2012). 177Lu was discussed to be advantageous for bone imaging, due to the medium energy 
gamma radiation emitted and the half-life of more than six days, giving a balance between practical 
considerations for handling and duration of radiation exposure (O'Mara, 1969).  
Animal studies with the radioactive isotope of lutelium, 177Lu, have shown that it has a high affinity 
with bone tissue and given its unique radioactive characteristics of emitting both beta and gamma 
energy, may be a useful product for imaging bone tissue. In addition, it has been shown that 177Lu can 
have an immunosuppressive and growth suppressive effect supporting its suitability in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
177Lu decays to the more stable isotope 177Hf, which is reported to be present in nature and can be 
taken up in food, drinking water or as inhaled dust. Its use for some medical applications has been also 
explored e.g. intravascular radiocontrast imaging, administration of hafnium oxide nanoparticles in 
cancer models or in medical devices for implantation in bone. 
Hafnium  alloys  are  being  characterised  for  use  in  bone  implants,  such  as  hip  replacement  (Matsuno, 
2001).  Hafnium  was  well  tolerated  in  rats  where  hafnium  was  implanted  to  allow  contact  with  bone 
marrow  and  bone  surface.  No  inflammatory  response  was  observed  around  the  implants,  and  all  the 
implants  were  encapsulated  with  thin  fibrous  connective  tissue.  Histological  examination  of  the  hard 
tissue showed that the amount of new bone formation decreased slightly from the second to the fourth 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 18/68 
 
 
 
week after implantation, and that the percentage of bone in contact with the implant increased markedly 
over the same period.  
177Lu: uses in radioimmunotherapy 
The purpose of 177Lu is to be linked to the selected protein or peptide to be used in radioimmunotherapy. 
This linking is achieved using specific chelators, i.e. molecules which complex [177Lu]3+ presented in an 
aqueous solution. The stability of the chelated complex is critical for the pharmacodynamics and for the 
pharmacokinetics of administered radioimmunotherapeutics since it determines whether the radiotracer 
reaches its intended target and whether 177Lu may be released from the complex after administration. 
177Lu was found to form stable complexes with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid 
(DOTA)  and  with  DOTA-based  complexing  agents  such  as  1,  4,  7,  10-tetraaza-N-(1-carboxy-3-(4-
nitrophenyl)propyl)-N',  N",  N"'-tris(acetic  acid)  cyclododecane  (PA-DOTA).  These  chelators  molecules 
could  be  rapidly  filled  with  177Lu  in  vitro,  resulting  in  stable  complexes  with  high  (>98%)  rates  of 
labelling, if optimised labelling conditions were selected (Breeman, 2003) (Li, 2001) (Stimmel, 1998). 
The complex with DOTA was found to be highly stable and mostly irreversible, with release of less than 
5% of the label within 21 days of incubation in vitro (Brouwers, 2004). 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Lu3+ has been investigated as a membrane stabilizing agent, inhibiting transmembrane calcium 
permeation. Using a rat aorta preparation in vitro, lutetium and other rare earth metals were 
investigated for their effects on calcium distribution and transmembrane calcium movements, using 
the radioactive isotope Calcium-45. In addition, the effects of lutetium on aortic smooth muscle 
contractions were examined, since calcium entry is essential for contractions. At a concentration of 1.5 
mM in the bath solution, Lu3+ reduced the calcium uptake in the preparation and had a relaxant 
property, interpreted as membrane stabilization (Weiss, 1975).  
Ionic lutetium was also shown to interfere with inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
neurotransmission, resulting in enhancement of GABA currents. The effect of Lu3+ was investigated in 
rat septal neurons in culture by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. GABA (10 μM) currents 
were moderately enhanced by about 40% upon application of a concentration of 100 μM Lu3+ 
(Kumamoto, 1996).   
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Lutetium 
The safety pharmacology of lutetium in its ionic form was evaluated using the isolated rabbit ileum, in 
anaesthetised cats and in non-anaesthetised rats. 
In the isolated rabbit ileum preparation, lutetium chloride produced a concentration dependent 
relaxant effect, and at high concentrations (up to 40 mg) an irreversible paralysis was observed. If the 
rabbit ileum was pre-contracted with acetylcholine or nicotine, the contraction of these agents was 
antagonised with an antispasmodic EC50 of 0.6 and 0.5 mg/ml. In a different preparation, the cat 
superior ganglion preparation, lutetium had no ganglion blocking effect, indicating that the smooth 
muscle relaxant effect was due to a direct interaction with the muscle, in line with the reported calcium 
blocking activity of high concentrations of lutetium (Weiss, 1975) (Haley, 1964). 
Cardiovascular effects of intravenously administered lutetium chloride were investigated in the 
anaesthetised cat. No pharmacological effects on respiration or on the cardiovascular system were 
observed in the dose range 1 to 10 mg/kg lutetium chloride, upon cumulative dosing. In this 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 19/68 
 
 
 
publication, the intravenous LD50 for anaesthetized cats was established at 20 mg/Kg (12.5 mg/kg 
lutetium). However, even at this dose no QT-prolongation was reported. Within the dose range tested, 
lutetium chloride had no influence on the pharmacological response to acetylcholine, histamine, or 
electrical vagal stimulation (Haley, 1964). 
Lutetium administration in non-anaesthetised rats had no effect on calcium accumulation at the dose 
level of 10 mg/kg i.v., but it resulted in increased concentration of calcium in various organs (liver, 
spleen, lungs and kidneys) at 20 mg/kg i.v. Lutetium (10 mg/kg) had no effect on hepatic metabolism, 
as indicated by a lack of change in hepatic cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids, serum lipids, 
and serum hepatic enzyme activity of aspartate transaminase (GOT or AST) and alanine transaminase 
(GPT or ALT) (Nakamura, 1997).   
Hafnium 
The safety pharmacology of hafnium chloride in its ionic form was evaluated using the guinea pig 
isolated ileum and in anaesthetised cats.  
In the isolated guinea pig ileum preparation, hafnium chloride produced a concentration dependent 
relaxant effect, and at high concentrations (range tested: 10 to 200 mg, reference volume not given, 
most likely 10-200 mg/100 ml) an irreversible paralysis was obtained. If the rabbit ileum was pre-
contracted with acetylcholine or nicotine, the contraction of these agents was antagonised with an 
antispasmodic EC50 of 128 and 99 mg, respectively (again, reference volume not given). In a different 
preparation, the cat superior ganglion preparation, hafnium had no ganglion blocking effect, indicating 
that the smooth muscle relaxant effect was due to a direct interaction with the muscle (Haley, 1962). 
The cardiovascular effect of intravenously administered hafnium chloride was investigated in the 
anaesthetised cat.  In cats, no pharmacological effects on respiration and cardiovascular function were 
observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg Within the dose range tested, hafnium 
chloride had no influence on the pharmacological response to acetylcholine, histamine, or electrical 
vagal stimulation. (Haley, 1962). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were presented (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No specific studies were submitted with 177-lutetium. The characterization of absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties for lutetium is based on published data. 
In the case of radiolabelled compound (177Lu), gamma counting to quantify radioactivity was used. 
Non-labelled lutetium was quantified by using flame ionization detection. The referenced methods of 
analysis were obtained from the scientific publications provided in this section. 
Distribution of 177Lu 
According to the general information provided in the review by ICRP (Paquet, 2019), in rats, lutetium 
is mainly distributed in the skeleton and liver, 60 and 10% respectively. 
(Durbin, 1956)described the distribution of 177Lu produced as no carrier added in rats. In this study, 
radioactivity was majorly found in skeleton (80%) and only 2-3% in liver after 24 post dosing. 
Significant levels were also found in kidney, as the primary route of excretion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 20/68 
 
 
 
(O'Mara, 1969) investigated the distribution of [177Lu]LuCl3 in rabbits. In this study, effects of 
complexing agents were analysed. The authors concluded that the formation of a high stability 
constant complex (with DTPA), produced the rapid excretion in the urine without substantial 
reticuloendothelial or skeletal uptake. Complexes of low stability, "radiocolloid" formation and 
reticuloendothelial localization was observed, resulting in hepatic uptake. With hydroxyethyl 
ethylenediamine triacetic acid (HEDTA) as the complexing agent, complexes of intermediate stability 
were formed, and deposition in potential target organs was possible with no formation of 
‘radiocolloids’. With this complex, approximately 50% of the administered dose was taken up in the 
skeleton and then cleared by the kidneys.  
(Muller, 1978) described a similar profile in terms of biodistribution in mice after intraperitoneal (ip) 
administration of lutetium oxide (solubilized in KHSO4 and buffered with the complex forming agent 
citrate to a pH of 3.5). The highest levels of radioactivity were found in the skeleton (about 50%), 
followed by the liver, kidney and spleen, and with low exposure, the lung. The results of this study also 
showed the competition of radioactivity and non-radioactivity lutetium for bone uptake (when cold 
isotope dose was increased, deposition of radioactivity in bone was reduced). 
Biodistribution of lutetium (177Lu) chloride was investigated in rats using “cold” lutetium chloride 
among other chlorides of rare earth elements such as yttrium, cerium, praseodymium, europium, 
dysprosium, and ytterbium. The study results showed that rare earth elements are rapidly cleared 
from the systemic circulation upon IV administration, but there was significant and prolonged retention 
in the organs. The animals received either a low dose of 9 to 10 mg/kg body weight or a high dose of 
18 to 20 mg/kg body weight of each rare earth metal. At 1 day after IV administration, more than 78% 
of the elements injected were distributed into liver, bone and spleen. With regard to lutetium, the 
major organs of accumulation at a dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg were the liver (64-67%), bone (11-15%) 
and spleen (5%), while only minor amounts (< 2%) could be detected in lungs and kidneys 
(Nakamura, 1997) (Pałasz A, 2000). 
(Schmitt, 2003)conducted a biodistribution study in mice, after iv administration of radiolabelled 
lutetium. Again, liver, kidneys and bone (radioactivity was increasing with the time in the latter) 
showed the highest uptake values.  
(Araujo, 2007) published a summarizing report with [177Lu]LuCl3 in mice. The results in Table 4 showed 
the primary target organs of exposure as the bone, blood, kidney and liver.

Table 2. Activity concentration of 177Lu in different organs after administration of 
[177Lu]LuCl3 to Swiss mice expressed as % ID/g (Araujo, 2007) 
(Lungu, 2007) analysed the distribution of [177Lu]LuCl3 in tumour bearing Lewis rats (Table 5). The 
liver, kidney and bone were identified as the primary target organs for distribution, with a rapid 
clearance from blood. In bone, accumulation over 24 h followed by slow clearance was observed.  
Table 3.  Activity concentration of 177Lu in different organs after administration of 
[177Lu]LuCl3 to Lewis rats expressed as % ID/g (Lungu, 2007) 
Additional studies (Yousefnia, 2014) (Zolghadri, 2015) (Mirković, 2020) reported similar results as the 
ones from the previous distribution studies.  
Previous biodistribution data obtained in mice were scaled up to humans and the applicant estimated 
scaled time integrated activity values as well as estimate absorbed doses for target organs. See

Distribution of 177Hf 
(Hinerman, 1954) reported the distribution of hafnium after sc administration in rats. It was detected 
in the spleen, liver, bone, skin, adrenal glands, and in the gastrointestinal tract. There was no evidence 
of selective accumulation in adrenal glands. Hafnium was excreted both in faeces and urine. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of free 177Lu is described to decay to 177Hf, which is a stable isotope. Renal and faecal 
route, as well as radioactive decay are described to contribute to the elimination of lutetium.  
Excretion 
(O'Mara, 1969) described the excretion of lutetium-177 via urine after iv administration in rabbits. 
(Durbin, 1956) reported also faecal excretion following intramuscular dosing in rats. Radioactive decay 
is also considered, especially from bone. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Lutetium: single dose toxicity  
(Haley, 1964) reported the LD50 values in mice after a single dose (ip or po) of lutetium. Symptoms 
described were writhing, ataxia, laboured respiration, walking on toes with back arched, and sedation. 
Died animals were found within 24 hours. The intraperitoneal LD50 of lutetium chloride was 315 (267-
372) mg/kg, corresponding to 197 mg lutetium/kg. The oral LD50 in mice was 7100 (6633-7590) 
mg/kg, corresponding to 4435 mg lutetium/kg. In this publication, also the intravenous LD50 for 
anaesthetized cats was established at 20 mg/Kg (12.5 mg/kg lutetium). 
(Garrett, 1981) reported the subcutaneous LD50 in mouse (> 312 mg/kg lutetium). No lethality was 
induced, but calcification could be observed in the site of administration. 
(BRUCE, 1963) defined the intraperitoneal LD50 values of lutetium nitrate in mice and rats. In mice, 
LD50 was established at 290 (259-325) mg/kgf or the salt, corresponding to a dose of the metal of 
108 (97-121) mg/kg. In rats, an intraperitoneal LD50 of 335 mg/kg, corresponding to a dose of the 
metal of 125 (110-142) mg/kg, was determined.  
Hafnium: single dose toxicity  
(Haley, 1962) reported the toxicity of hafnium chloride (or hafnyl chloride, which is formed in water 
solution) in mice. Urination and lethargy were reported as acute toxicity symptoms, and deaths 
occurred within the 24 hours post dose. The intraperitoneal LD50 of hafnyl chloride was 112 (93.3-
134.4) mg/kg, corresponding to an LD50 of 76 mg/kg for hafnium.  
In the toxicity profile for lutetium published by (BIBRA toxicity profile, 1994), oral LD50 in rats was 
fixed at 2362 mg/kg for HfCl4, whereas up to 10 g/kg of hafnium dioxide orally were tolerated in mice 
without lethality. For iv administration in rats, hafnium-sodium mandelate was used (improving 
solubility). The intravenous LD50 was 75 – 100 mg hafnium/kg (an exact LD50 could not be calculated, 
since the ratio of hafnium to sodium mandelate was not given in the report). In cats, the intravenous 
administration of 10 mg hafnium chloride/kg (corresponding to about 5.56 mg hafnium/kg) was lethal.

2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Lutetium: repeat dose toxicity (90 days)  
(Haley, 1964) reported the NOEL value for LuCl3 in rats at 1% in the diet (for 90 days), corresponding 
to about 1000 mg lutetium chloride/kg body weight or 625 mg lutetium/kg body weight.  
Hafnium: repeat dose toxicity (up to 90 days) 
In the toxicity profile for lutetium published by Bibra (1994), iv administration of hafnium dichloride 
(10 weeks at a dose of 14 mg/kg BW) in rats resulted in slower growth. No further signs of toxicity 
were reported. 
(Haley, 1962) reported a NOEL value in rats after oral administration of hafnium chloride at 0.1% in 
the diet, corresponding to about 100 mg hafnium chloride/kg body weight or 55.5 mg hafnium/kg body 
weight (90 days of administration in the diet). No signs of toxicity were observed, but there was a dose 
dependent metabolic adaptation reaction seen in the liver, with perinuclear vacuolization and coarse 
granularity of the parenchymal cells. The findings were prominent in the 1% feeding group, but only 
sparse in the 0.1 and 0.01% feeding groups. The NOEL of orally administered hafnium chloride was 
considered to be 0.1% in the diet, corresponding to about 100 mg hafnium chloride/kg body weight or 
55.5 mg hafnium/kg body weight. 
In guinea pigs (BIBRA toxicity profile, 1994), a slightly increased liver weights and slightly reduced 
kidney and spleen weights were noted although they were not statistically significant. Histopathology 
revealed slight thickening of the alveolar walls in the lung and granularity in the cytoplasm of 
hepatocytes. No NOAEL was determined up to 2000 mg/kg daily for one month by oral administration 
of hafnium dioxide.  
(Hinerman, 1954) described the effect of hafnium sodium mandelate (undefined amount of hafnium) 
following oral, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration in rats. The oral dose of 5-25 mg/rat for 
up to 16 days was well tolerated, and no signs of toxicity observed. The subcutaneous and 
intramuscular administration of up to 35 mg/rat for three weeks resulted in no overt systemic toxicity 
other than reduced body weight gain, but animals developed local abscesses related to the dosing site. 
Examination revealed that hafnium precipitated as insoluble material at the injection site and was 
taken up by mononuclear phagocytes. Histological evaluation revealed that the insoluble material was 
also carried to the reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen, liver, lymph nodes and occasionally also the 
kidneys. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No studies of mutagenicity with lutetium 177 were provided (see 2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
(Muller, 1978) showed an increased rate of osteosarcoma formation in rats after a 12-month exposure 
period to 177Lu (estimated dose 2000-8000 rd, 20-80 Gy). It was comparable to the effect of the 
radiation from exposure to strontium-90. 
(Shelley, 1973) reported the formation of dysplastic cartilage at the site of injection (intradermal) 
when hafnium oxychloride (3 mM, about 20 μg/mouse administered locally) was dosed to mice. It was 
observed 5 months after administration and was comparable to the effect observed for zirconium 
chloride. Other metal salts with known carcinogen potential including beryllium, cadmium, chromium, 
Assessment report

Page 25/68 
 
 
 
cobalt, and nickel, did not induce this local reaction. No such local reactions were observed in humans 
after intradermal injection of hafnium oxychloride (Shelley, 1958).  
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No effect was reported on reproductive organs after a 90-day dosing period (food) for lutetium or 
hafnium chloride. The NOEL for lutetium and hafnium was 625 mg/kg body weight (Haley, 1964) and 
55.5 mg/kg body weight (Haley, 1962), respectively. 
No data for teratogenic potential were submitted (see 2.5.6. Discussion on nonclinical aspects). 
No dedicated reproductive toxicity or juvenile animal studies were submitted (see 2.5.6. Discussion on 
nonclinical aspects) 
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance of lutetium chloride  
(Haley, 1964) reported the action of concentrated lutetium chloride (1:1 solution) to eyes, resulting in 
local irritation and delayed ulceration of the cornea, which healed completely within two weeks. When 
crystalline lutetium chloride (0.5 g) was applied to intact skin, no irritation was caused. While the 
crystalline compound in contact with abraded skin, produced a severe reaction. The irritated skin 
healed only after 35 days with formation of scar tissue.  
Local irritation or necrosis were observed after intradermal administration (even at the lowest 
concentration tested 1:104 and 1:105 dilution in water). Formation of nodules (crystalline deposits of 
unknown composition, although probably they represent calcifications) was observed. Foreign body 
giant cells surrounded the crystals, and fibroblasts were found in the outer area. 
(Garrett, 1981) described local calcifications in mice when lutetium chloride was administered (sc) at a 
concentration range of 500 to 10000 μg/0.2 ml. A dose of 200 μg/0.2 ml did not cause local 
calcification.  
Local tolerance of hafnium chloride  
(Haley, 1962) published that the application of a 1:1000 dilution of hafnyl chloride (pH 2.1) caused no 
damage of the cornea or iris or irritation of the conjunctiva. However, 1 mg of hafnium chloride (dry 
substance) in the eyes of rabbits caused an immediate increase in blinking rate and redness of the 
conjunctiva. It was completed reverted at 24 hours post dose. 
In the skin, hafnium chloride produced a minor transient irritation. However, the direct application of 
crystals on abraded skin caused a strong local irritation, with ulceration observed at seven days and no 
healing at 14 days. The difference was attributed to the release of HCl from hafnium chloride.  
Finally, intradermal injection of hafnyl chloride in guinea pigs (diluted solution 1:104 and 1:108) 
produced mild transient local irritation and complete remission to normal within seven days. At higher 
concentrations, stronger irritation was observed (probably for the acidic nature of the compound).

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I 
PEC (Predicted Environmental Concentration) estimation was based on the maximum recommended 
dose of 0.002 mg, resulting in a PECsw value of 0.0000001096 µg/L. This value is below the action 
limit established in the guideline, so phase II was not considered necessary.  
Doseai 
Maximum daily dose of active ingredient per inhabitant. According to the 
specific activity and the radiation dose limit of 6 GBq/dose, the highest

As for potential risk for accumulation (highly lipophilic compounds with an experimentally determined 
logKow (LogP) of >4.5), would require additional testing. In the case of lutetium chloride, it dissociates 
to [177Lu]Lu3+ and chloride when in solution, and is therefore an electrolyte. According to the guideline, 
no ERA studies are required upon justification for electrolytes, as Lu3+ as due to their nature they are 
unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Similar consideration is assumed for 177-
Hafnium. In both cases, no accumulation is expected given they are electrolytes. 
With regards to a potential hormone function or an endocrine disruptive function, no accumulation in 
reproductive organs has been reported and the applicant considers an interaction with endocrine 
system as unlikely.  
The radiation related risk indicated that the final product prepared from Lu177 is intended to have a 
high affinity for the target issue and will be in the body for more time than the radioactive life-time 
(6.647 days). In addition, administration of LU177 will be performed in a hospital facility preventing 
the radioactive contamination of the general sewage system, so the radioactive environmental 
exposure will be limited to a minimum 
Nevertheless, an environmental risk assessment should be carried out and submitted separately for 
any final radiolabelled product, which was prepared using lutetium (177Lu) n.c.a.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In accordance with the chosen legal basis, the information provided in this dossier is based on 
published literature. No dedicated nonclinical studies conducted with lutetium-177 have been 
submitted by the applicant. As non-clinical data have been derived from the published literature, the 
GLP status could not be verified from most of these publications, given that some of them were 
conducted and published prior to the GLP requirements came into force. However, the non-clinical data 
submitted were considered acceptable and it was not considered needed to repeat animal studies 
under GLP conditions, in the present case. 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride non carrier added is a precursor to be used for radiolabelling purposes. The 
isotope will be linked to a disease-specific carrier for targeted radiotherapy. 
Pharmacological actions are shown for lutetium as a free radioisotope according to the reports and 
publications on its medical use. Animal studies with the radioactive isotope of lutelium, 177Lu, have 
shown that it has a high affinity with bone tissue and given its unique radioactive characteristics of 
emitting both beta and gamma energy, may be a useful product for imaging bone tissue.  
177Lu decays to the more stable isotope 177Hf, which is reported to be present in nature and can be 
taken up in food, drinking water or as inhaled dust. Similarly, pharmacology actions of hafnium 177 
are shown. Its use for some medical applications has also been explored e.g. intravascular 
radiocontrast imaging, administration of hafnium oxide nanoparticles in cancer models or in medical 
devices for implantation in bone. 
In relation to secondary pharmacology, two studies were presented, one describing the effects of 
lutetium ions on calcium distribution (Weiss, 1975) and the other studying the effects of ionic lutetium 
on inhibitory GABA neurotransmission (Kumamoto, 1996). These effects were observed at 
concentrations far above those used in the intended clinical practice for ilLuzyce. 
No novel actions from the already reported are described in terms of pharmacological effects. 
Overall, toxicological data were also referred to scientific publications. The toxicity of non-radioactive 
lutetium chloride has been studied in different mammalian species and using different administration 
routes. Limited information after repeat dose of lutetium has been provided by the applicant. No 
studies after iv administration are presented. NOEL value was established at 1% (equivalent to 625 mg

lutetium/kg body weight) in rats after receiving a diet containing lutetium chloride for 90 days.  The 
intraperitoneal LD50 in mice was found to be approximately 315 mg/kg. In cats, no pharmacological 
effects on respiration and cardiovascular function were observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose 
of 10 mg/kg. A high dose of 10 GBq of lutetium (177Lu) chloride contains 2.4 μg lutetium, 
corresponding to a human dose of 0.034 μg/kg. This dose is approximately 7 orders of magnitude 
lower than the intraperitoneal LD50 in mice and more than 5 orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL 
observed in cats. Therefore, lutetium metal-ion toxicity of ilLuzyce (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products 
can be excluded.In the case of hafnium, iv administration for 10 weeks resulted in slower growth of 
rats, with no symptoms of toxicity. When hafnium was orally dosed (diet), the NOEL was 55.5 mg/Kg 
body weight. In guinea pigs receiving hafnium (po), no NOAEL was set up to 2000 mg/Kg/day. An 
additional study, carried out in rats treated with hafnium sodium mandelate (no equivalent dose of 
hafnium was provided) showed findings in the spleen, liver, lymph nodes and kidneys, due to the 
presence of insoluble hafnium precipitated. Hafnium toxicity was also reviewed.  
In addition, given that both lutetium and hafnium elicit no pharmacological effects at clinically relevant 
concentrations the lack of pharmacodynamic interaction studies is acceptable. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of lutetium has been described based on scientific publications referencing 
standard methods of analysis (gamma counting and flame ionization detection) to quantify 
radiolabelled and non-radiolabelled molecules.  
No absorption studies were conducted with animals. The applicant mentioned that following 
intravenous administration of [177Lu]LuCl3, 177Lu is rapidly cleared from the blood. Other routes of 
administration, as oral route, indicate that the oral uptake of lutetium following oral ingestion is low, 
typically less than 0.5% (International Commission of Radiological Protection, ICRP, (Sowby, 1981)). 
Distribution was reported to mainly occur in bone, liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen. Short-term 
analysis indicated a distribution mainly in liver and kidney, while long-term uptake was shown in 
skeleton. It was also dependent on the complex formed after administration. Formation of stable 
complexes led to a rapid excretion, via urine with no accumulation. Low stability complexes caused 
radiocolloids, which were then localised in liver via reticuloendothelial system. Intermediate stability 
complexes localised in skeleton. Free lutetium administration was shown to result in hafnium-177 
accumulation in bone (long-term uptake of lutetium-177), given radioactive decay. As for the 
calculation of the “scaled time-integrated activity values (Â) MBq*h] for injection activity of 1000 MBq 
in humans, it was based on published biodistribution data (See 2.6.2.2. ).  
Free 177Lu is not metabolized, although it decays to 177Hf, which is a stable isotope. No free 177Lu is 
administered or released, so the metabolism of the final product will depend on the carrier molecule. 
Given that since it is a precursor to be used for in vitro radiolabelling of carrier molecules and is not 
directly injected in patients, the absence of pharmacokinetic drug interactions and other 
pharmacokinetic studies is considered acceptable. 
Extrapolation to humans from mammalian species, showed that although there is no accumulation of 
lutetium, low exposure to radiation may be expected for male and female reproductive organs.  
The acute toxicity profile of lutetium and hafnium was described in mice, rats and cats. Correspondent 
LD50 values were established by using different routes of administrations (po, ip, iv). Signs of acute 
toxicity were ataxia, laboured respiration, or lethargy. Deaths occurred within 24 hours post dose, and 
peak was normally registered at 48 hours.  
No genotoxicity studies were presented by the applicant. This is acceptable, considering the 
therapeutic dose levels intended.

EMA/689220/2022  
Page 29/68 
 
 
 
According to Annex 1 Part I of Dir 2001/83/EC, carcinogenicity studies are required in case of long-
term exposure. Radiopharmaceutical are used for a short period of time. Despite the known 
carcinogenic potential due to the radiation emitted during radioactive decay and described in rats after 
12 months of exposure to lutetium 177 (estimated dose 2000-8000 rd, 20-80 Gy), the absence of 
carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable, given the conditions for use of this product. Of 
note, the potential risk of osteosarcoma described in rats after 12 months exposure was comparable to 
the effect of the radiation from exposure to strontium-90 (See 2.5.4.4. and 2.6.9. ).  
No dedicated reproductive toxicity or juvenile animal studies with lutetium were presented. Effects of 
lutetium (177Lu) chloride on male and female fertility have not been studied in animals. Low exposures 
could be demonstrated for male and female sexual organs. It cannot be excluded that 177Lu-labelled 
medicinal products lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or 
genetic damage in male testes or female ovaries (see SmPC section 4.6). Further information 
concerning the use of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products concerning fertility is specified in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
Local tolerance effects observed with lutetium (and hafnium) can be attributed to the acidic character 
of the solution, which produces irritation or even necrosis of the tissues. However, lutetium chloride is 
not intended for direct administration in human. 
The damage on tissues or necrosis (pH 1-2) caused by a paravenous injection or infusion into small or 
collapsed large veins were reported to be potentially irreversible (Braun Melsungen AG, 2006). In case 
of accidental administration of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., solution to the patient, the catheter or 
affected area should be irrigated with isotonic saline solution. 
A risk associated with inadvertent administration of 177LuCl3 has been identified. (See 2.6.9. ) 
An environmental risk assessment conducted in accordance with the guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for the 
chemical molecule, and not for the radiation produced as radiopharmaceutical was provided. Lutetium-
177 PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and therefore, lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of Lutetium-177 have been assessed and the information submitted is 
considered adequate. The main concern relates to the development of osteosarcoma and its latency 
observed in rats and mice studies after long-term exposure, however Lutetium-177 is only intended for 
short-term use. The risk has been addressed in the RMP as a potential safety concern and in the 
SmPC, which includes recommendations on the addition of DTPA prior to intravenous administration of 
177Lu labelled ligands. 
No supplementary animal studies are needed because safety issues can adequately be evaluated from 
the literature. 
The toxicological properties of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling 
with ilLuzyce prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. 
For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the non-clinical aspects 
of ilLuzyce have been adequately addressed.

2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
This is an application submitted under the legal basis of Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, well-
established use. The applicant has justified this with evidence of the first diagnostic and therapeutic 
use of 177Lu being over a decade ago in Europe and provided further evidence to support an increase 
over the years in the use of this product as a radiolabel. ilLuzyce radiopharmaceutical precursor, which 
is intended for radiolabelling purposes and therefore not to be used directly in patients.  
The applicant did not submit any clinical efficacy study, but in line with the Annex 1 Part III of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, on radiopharmaceutical precursors, relevant information on the 
clinical utility of the radiopharmaceutical precursor Lutetium (177Lu) chloride when is attached to 
appropriate carrier molecules was provided.  
A brief literature overview is presented on the various applications of 177Lu-labelled tracer molecules. 
Tracer molecules (see Table 1, in section 2.1.2- Epidemiology) were selected based on the experience 
in the field of radiopharmaceuticals, especially the tracer molecules DOTATATE, DOTATOC, DOTANOC 
as well as PSMA are widely known and can be considered well-established in this field. Thus, the 
applicant considered relevant clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-labelled tracer 
molecules as well as 177Lu-labelled tracer complexes, in and outside the EU. No restrictions were made 
in terms of the particular clinical indication. 
An initial PubMed search in February 2021 using the terms “lutetium” OR “lutetium-177” OR “177Lu” 
revealed about 3000 hits, including all articles without any limitation. Focusing on the most important 
molecules regularly used in daily clinical practice for specific radiotherapies, the literature search was 
then narrowed down using the additional search terms “DOTATOC”, “DOTATATE”, “DOTANOC”, 
“EDTMP”, “PSMA”, “antibody”, and “safety”.  
Each article was evaluated for relevance based on title, abstract or the complete article. Full text 
articles were evaluated, including a check of the reference lists for further relevant articles.  
GCP aspects 
Not applicable as no clinical studies have been conducted with ilLuzyce. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has not provided any clinical studies referring to clinical pharmacology for Lutetium 
(177Lu) chloride n.c.a (see 2.6.3.  discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., solution is a radiopharmaceutical precursor which is only intended for 
use in in-vitro-labelling of medicinal products for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of the proposed medicinal product depend on the particular tracer molecule 
labelled with radionuclide and its linker (chelator) which may affect the pharmacokinetics of the 
radionuclide (Forrer F, 2004), (Hijnen NM, 2012 ).

2.6.2.2.  Dosimetry 
Dosimetry of lutetium (177Lu) chloride 
The presented dosimetry data derived from literature in mice, rats and rabbits. 
Dosimetry of the active substance Lutetium (177Lu) chloride was investigated to evaluate the 
contribution of non-conjugated lutetium-177 to the radiation exposure following the administration of a 
177Lu-labelled tracer or resulting from an accidental injection of the precursor according to literature. 
Following intravenous administration of lutetium (177Lu) chloride, 177Lu was rapidly cleared from the 
blood. Primary target organs were bone, liver and kidney. 
Scientific studies published were used for the dosimetry calculations based on the fact that the studies 
were realised for 177LuCl3. The studies used were the available literature for 177LuCl3 and were also used 
in  previous  applications  by  other  marketing  authorisation  holders.  Reported  biodistribution  data  for 
177LuCl3  in  mice  (Araujo,  2007),  (Mirković,  2020),  (Repetto-Llamazares,  2013),  (Schmitt,  2003)  and 
(Yousefnia, 2014) were scaled to humans using the following equation: 
where TACH is the time-activity curve (TAC) equivalent for humans, TACA is the organ TAC for animals 
(mice or rats) from the considered studies, OH is the organ mass for humans, BWH is the body weight 
for humans, OA is the organ mass for animals and BWA is the animal body weight. Body weight and 
organ masses for the animals were obtained from the animal biodistribution studies while the human 
body weight and organ masses were assumed to be for an average adult human (mean between adult 
male and female (Bolch, 2016)). Decay correction in TACs was revoked from the animal data when 
decay-corrected data was reported in the animal studies. When multiple bone structures were reported 
(e.g. femur and skull) the bone TAC was generated with the mean of the reported structures. (See 
2.5.3. ). 
In order to provide dose calculation for paediatric phantoms as well, the mean human Â have been 
scaled to the available Olinda/EXM 2.0 phantoms to determine model specific distribution data. The 
scaling between mean human and specific models was performed according to Eq.1.  
The Â values have been normalized to the injected activity of 1000 MBq to get the time integrated 
activity coefficient (TIAC) as required by Olinda/EXM 2. Olinda/EXM 2 models are based on ICRP 89 
Publication. 
All dose calculations were performed in Olinda/EXM 2 (Stabin, 2018) to have consistent dose results for 
all models (adults and paediatrics). 
Dose calculations (absorbed doses for target organs [mGy/MBq] and effective doses [mSv/MBq]) were 
performed in Olinda/EXM 2 dose calculator using the mean Â value (mean between the Â values 
obtained from each considered animal study) for each source organ. Organ doses were reported for an 
adult male and female model as well as 15-year, 10-year, 5-year, 1- year and newborn male and 
female models (see Table 8 and Table 9 below), according to ICRP 89 (International Commission on 
Radiological Protection). The results show osteogenic cells, liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen as 
the significant target organs for the biodistribution of lutetium (177Lu) chloride.

2.6.2.3.  Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
For PRRT, kidneys were usually the critical organs in terms of radiation toxicity due to non-specific or 
specific accumulation of radiolabelled peptide and renal excretion of radiolabelled peptides, and a range 
of  23-29  Gy  was  identified  as  renal  maximum  tolerated  dose.  Renal  irradiation  is  mainly  caused  by 
reabsorption of radiolabelled peptides in the proximal tubules (Zhang J, 2018). 
A  study  investigating  the  influence  of  renal  function  on  kidney  absorption  and  haematotoxicity  upon 
administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE to patients with advanced NETs was published by Svensson et al. in 
2015. Fifty-one patients with advanced NETs received 177Lu-DOTATATE at an average activity of 7.5 GBq 
(3.5-8.2 GBq) at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks on one to five occasions. A significant correlation could be 
found  between  inferior  renal  function  before  treatment  and  higher  received  renal  absorbed  dose  per 
administered activity (p<0.01). Patients with inferior renal function also experienced a higher grade of 
haematotoxicity  during  treatment  (p=0.01).  The  authors  concluded  that  despite  the  general  good 
tolerability of PRRT in patients with an advanced NETs– patients with inferior renal function are at risk 
of being exposed to higher absorbed doses to normal tissue on treatment (Svensson J, 2015). 
Individualised treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE based on kidney dosimetry was investigated by Sundlöv 
and colleagues in 2017. Patients were treated with repeated cycles of 7.4 GBq 177Lu-DOTATATE at 8-12-
week intervals. Although GFR decreased in most patients after the completion of treatment, no grade 3-
4 toxicity was observed. Patients with a reduced baseline GFR were considered to have an increased risk 
of  GFR  decline.  It  was  concluded  from  the  available  data  that  individualised  PRRT  based  on  kidney 
dosimetry provides a safe and efficacious treatment approach (Sundlöv A, 2017). 
Race 
Data on diagnostic performance of radiolabelled PSMA-tracers in black South-African and white South-
African prostate carcinoma patients were presented (Sathekge M, 2018). Maximum standardized uptake 
value (SUVmax) values were found to be significantly higher in black South-Africans than in white South-
Africans. Moreover, SUVmax values correlated significantly with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
values, which were significantly higher in black South-Africans than in white South-Africans. The data 
suggested  that  PCa  behaved  more  aggressive  in  black  South-Africans  compared  to  the  white  patient 
cohort and therefore, PSMA expression was much higher in tumour tissue of black patients. This was 
also reported in other studies where a two- to three-times higher mortality from prostate carcinoma in 
black African men compared to Caucasians was observed.  
A study published in 2017 by Delpassand and colleagues enrolled 144 consecutive patients (84 men and 
50 women; age range 11- 87 year; mean age 58.5) in the US with histologically confirmed NET which 
were mainly Caucasians (132 patients, 92.3% of total), but also Hispanics (5, 3.5%), African Americans 
(4, 2.8%), and Asians (2, 1.4%). No information on any differences in response to therapy or toxicity 
were provided by the authors (Hamiditabar M, 2017).  
2.6.2.4.  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant has not performed any pharmacokinetics interactions studies. 
In  general,  potential  drug  interactions  depend  on  the  medicinal  product  labelled  with  the  proposed 
radioactive precursor.

In order to prevent nephrotoxicity secondary to treatment of NETs with 177Lu-DOTATATE, an amino 
acid (AA) solution is co-infused resulting in decreased tubular renal reabsorption of 177Lu-DOTATATE. A 
study published by Puszkiel and co-workers aimed to quantify the impact of AA co-infusion on 177Lu-
DOTATATE PK in cancer patients and to evaluate its relationship with toxicity during the first treatment 
cycle. Patients (n=42) received 7.4GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE over a 30 min IV infusion. Infusion of AA 
started 2 h before and continued for 6 h after the infusion of 177Lu-DOTATATE. Indeed, AA co-infusion 
had a significant effect on 177Lu-DOTATATE PK, with a mean value of 1.5-fold (95% CI 1.03-1.97) 
increase in the elimination rate constant (k10) from 0.204 to 0.306 h-1. However, this AA co-infusion 
effect was associated with a large inter-individual variability of 104% contributing to the variability in 
177Lu-DOTATATE plasma exposure. This in turn impacts the haematotoxicity of 177Lu-DOTATATE as a 
clear association could be found between plasma AUC at day 15 and lymphocyte count (Puszkiel A, 
2019). 
2.6.2.5.  Pharmacodynamics 
The applicant has not submitted any pharmacodynamics-pharmacokinetics (PK/PD) studies. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., solution is a radiopharmaceutical precursor which is only intended for 
use in in-vitro-labelling of medicinal products for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The medicinal 
product intended for labelling with the precursor comprises a carrier molecule directing the 
radionuclide specifically to the site of disease (e.g. a solid tumour) as well as a linker molecule 
(chelator) suitable for radiolabelling.  The pharmacokinetics of a radiopharmaceutical would be 
dependent on the carrier molecule labelled with ilLuzyce. As unstable linkage between the radionuclide 
and the tracer molecule would otherwise cause release of free 177Lu from the complex, ilLuzyce should 
only be used with medicines intended for used in conjunction with radiolabelling.  The bioavailability of 
lutetium (177Lu)-labelled tracers used in radiotherapy can be considered 100% as they are usually 
administered via the intravenous route. As 177LuCl3 is not intended for direct use in humans, preclinical 
data were utilised and the doses were extrapolated for humans. Biodistribution of 177Lu3+ is consistent 
throughout the studies, showing bone, liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen as the main target 
organs. The distribution of lutetium-177 throughout the body will strongly depend on the respective 
medicinal product intended for labelling with the radionuclide. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy 
(PRRT) and radioligand therapy (RLT) are targeted therapy approaches directing the radionuclide 
specifically to the site of cancer.   
Dose calculations (absorbed doses for target organs [mGy/MBq] and effective doses [mSv/MBq]) were 
performed in Olinda/EXM 2 dose calculator using the mean Â value (mean between the Â values 
obtained from each considered animal study) for each source organ. Organ doses were reported for an 
adult male and female model as well as 15-year, 10-year, 5-year, 1-year and newborn male and 
female models. The presented methodology is considered adequate. According to the data provided by 
the applicant, after accidental injection of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., the total effective dose 
would be 0.132 mSv/MBq for adult female and 0.122 mSv/MBq for adult male. The effective dose for 
children varies between 1.02 mSv/MBq in 1-year-old and 0.158 mSv/MBq for 15-year-old model. 
Inadvertent injection of non- labelled lutetium-177 as well the effects of the free radionuclide following 
administration of 177Lu-labelled carriers should be discussed for radiopharmaceutical precursors. The 
applicant has provided enough information about the effects of free radionuclide in the dosimetry and 
clinical safety sections, considering published evidence and post-marketing experience from similar 
authorised medicinal products containing lutetium-177. See 2.6.2.2. Dosimetry.

Extrapolation of animal data to humans suggests that after accidental injection of Lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride n.c.a., the highest absorbed dose is to be expected in osteogenic cells. Other organs which 
receive higher absorbed doses are liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen.  
Following intravenous administration of 177LuCl3, 177Lu is rapidly cleared from the blood. The primary 
target organs are the bone, the liver and the kidneys. Data from experiments on mice, rats and rabbits 
indicate that more than half the lutetium entering the systemic circulation is deposited in the skeleton 
with only small amounts going to the liver and kidneys. 177Lu3+ shows high affinity to bone tissue with 
some retention in the skeleton. Its affinity to the bone can be explained by the fact that Lu3+, as a 
lanthanoid, has some chemical similarities with Ca2+, which is characterized by a high uptake in bone 
tissue. Therefore, lanthanoids were used for Ca2+ probes in biochemical and physiological studies 
(Hirano S, 1996). Lutetium-177 has a biological half-life of between 10 and 40 days in the soft tissue 
in mice and rats compared to a long biological half-life in the skeleton. However, these long half-life 
values are not of relevance for lutetium-177 non-carrier added (n.c.a.), since it completely decays with 
a half-life of 6.71 days following administration to form stable Hf, preventing any accumulation of 
lutetium-177 over time.  
Appropriate information about 177Lu3+ biodistribution and dosimetry have been included in the SmPC, 
sections 5.2 and 11.  
Radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been 
reported following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other 
radioisotopes. Renal function should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and renal protection 
should be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance.  
No clear conclusions on the influence of race on the performance of 177Lu-labelled tracers can be drawn 
from the presented literature data. Nevertheless, potential differences in SUV values dependent on the 
patient’s race cannot be excluded.  
No specific relationship on pharmacology and weight has been addressed.  
From the published data, there is no evidence for significant differences between elderly and adult 
patients.  
No data have been submitted for the paediatric population on grounds that the specific medicinal 
product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric 
patients. This is reflected under 5.1 in the SmPC and a cress reference is added in 4.2 to refer for more 
information concerning paediatric use of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. No specific 
information about pharmacology on impaired hepatic function has been provided. 
No specific information on gender-specificities has been provided. There is no evidence from pertinent 
literature that radionuclides show gender-specificities. Depending on the medicinal product to be 
labelled with the proposed radioactive precursor, gender-specific use of the final 177Lu-labelled tracer 
might be of relevance, e.g., in case of PSMA-targeting ligands used in prostate cancer patients. 
The applicant has not performed any pharmacokinetics interactions studies. In general, potential drug 
interactions depend on the medicinal product labelled with the proposed radioactive precursor. 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a. is not intended to be directly administered to the patient, therefore, no 
pharmacodynamic effect is sought for the unconjugated radionuclide. The pharmacodynamics of a 
radiopharmaceutical would also be dependent on the carrier molecule and on the method of

conjugation used to link it to the radioisotope. Thus, the lack of studies in pharmacology for this 
application is acceptable. 
Skeletal uptake also seems to be determined by whether lutetium is present with a carrier or not. 
Although 177Lu3+ emits beta-minus radiation with a low range of only 2 mm only, it can be assumed 
that the significant distribution of 177Lu3+ to the skeleton may induce DNA damages and mutations in 
osteogenic cells as well as in the bone marrow. Clinically, this becomes visible by, on the one hand, a 
haematotoxic effect (myelosuppression) which is caused by the diminution of haematopoietic cells due 
to the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (followed by apoptosis). On the other hand, refractory 
cytopenia with multi-lineage dysplasia (so-called ‘myelodysplastic syndrome’) and acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) are possible adverse radiation effects. Decreased blood cell count (anaemia, 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, pancytopenia) and myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) / acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been included in the RMP as important 
identified risks. In addition, special warnigns and precautions for use have been included in the SmPC. 
(See 2.6.9. Discussion on clinical safety). 
In the bone tissue itself, radiation induced DNA damage/mutations may become apparent through the 
occurrence of osteosarcoma. An increased rate of osteosarcoma formation was observed in animals 
examined 12 months after an exposure to an estimated dose of 20 to 80 Gy. Of note, with lutetium-
177 n.c.a, only the radioactive isotope 177Lu is administered, which completely decays to stable 
hafnium. Therefore, any long-term uptake in bone does not translate in bone accumulation of lutetium 
over time, as the material decays. (See 2.5.4.4. and 2.5.6.) 
The clinical pharmacology of 177Lu-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium 
(177Lu) chloride n.c.a. prior to administration will be dependent on the type of the medicinal product to 
be  radiolabelled.  Lutetium  (177Lu)  chloride  n.c.a.  is  not  intended  to  be  directly  administered  to  the 
patient. Therefore, the lack of pharmacology studies is considered acceptable. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Adequate  information  was  provided  about  177Lu3+ biodistribution  and  dosimetry  calculations,  showing 
bone, liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen as the main target organs.  
The clinical pharmacology of ilLuzyce will be dependent on the carrier molecule and on the method of 
conjugation used to link it to the radionuclide. The relevant clinical pharmacology data with ilLuzyce 
will have to be submitted separately with the application for the different carrier molecules. Thus, the 
lack of studies in pharmacology for this application is acceptable. For the purpose of an application for 
a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the clinical pharmacology of ilLuzyce has been adequately 
addressed. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant did not submit any clinical efficacy study, but in line with the Annex 1 Part III of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended, on radiopharmaceutical precursors, relevant information on the clinical utility 
of the radiopharmaceutical precursor Lutetium (177Lu) chloride when is attached to appropriate carrier 
molecules was provided. (See 2.6.1. Introduction) 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The applicant did not submit studies on dose response (see clinical efficacy discussion).

2.6.5.2.  Clinical Utility 
1. Efficacy of 177Lu-oxodotreotide 
The applicant submitted evidence from 7 phase I/II trials 11 studies and 1 meta-analysis (Kim SJ, 2015) 
investigating the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-oxodotreotide in the radiotherapy of NETs. 
The main studies are summarised as follows. 
A meta-analysis was published by Kim and co-workers in 2015 aiming at the evaluation of efficacy of 
177Lu-labelled PRRT in patients with inoperable or metastatic NETs. Six studies with 473 patients (4 in 
RECIST  criteria1 group  with  356  patients,  3  in  SWOG  criteria2 group  with  375  patients  and  1  in  both 
groups) were included. In the RECIST criteria group disease response rates ranged between 17.6 and 
43.8% with a pooled effect of 29 % [95% CI 24-34%]. Disease control rates ranged from 71.8 to 100%. 
The random-effects model showed an average disease control rate of 81 % (95 % CI 71-91%). In the 
SWOG criteria group disease response rates ranged between 7.0 and 36.5 % with a pooled effect of 23 
%  (95%  CI  11-38%).  Disease  control  rates  ranged  from  73.9  to  89.1%.  The  random-effects  model 
showed  an  average disease  control  rate  of  82 %  (95%  CI  71-91%).  The  authors  concluded  from  the 
meta-analysis that  177Lu-labelled PRRT is an effective treatment option for patients with inoperable or 
metastatic NETs (Kim SJ, 2015). 
Several  phase  I/II  clinical  trials  comprising  a  significant  number  of  patients  showed  efficacy  and 
tolerability of PRRT using 177Lu-oxodotreotide in the treatment of NETs, mainly of gastroenteropancreatic 
origin (GEP-NETs). However, promising results have also been achieved in patients with pancreatic NETs 
or BP-NETs.  
Additionally, literature data about the therapeutic use of 177Lu-oxodotreotide in other indications different 
than NETs were presented. Per the literature, 177Lu-oxodotreotide PRRT was reported as a possible safe 
and  effective  treatment  option  in  inoperable  or  metastatic  paragangliomas  (PGLs)  and  malignant 
pheochromocytomas (PCCs), which are rare tumours with only limited options for systemic treatment. 
In a study investigating the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-oxodotreotide in 30 patients with PGL (n=27) or 
PCC  (n=3),  best  tumour  response  was  partial  response  in  7  (23%)  and  stable  disease  in  20  (67%), 
whereas 3 (10%) patients had progressive disease. In 20 patients with baseline disease progression, 
tumour control was observed in 17 (85%) (Zandee WT, 2019). A favourable efficacy and safety profile 
in the treatment of PGLs and PCCs was also reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis published 
in 2019 by Satapathy and co-workers. Overall, treatment with PRRT was reported to achieve an objective 
response rate of 25% and a disease control rate of 84%. Clinical and biochemical responses were seen 
in 61% and 64% of the patients, respectively. Among the PRRTs, similar tumour response rates were 
noted for 90Y- and 177Lu-based agents (Satapathy S, 2019).  
2. Efficacy of 177Lu-DOTATOC  
Several  studies  were  performed  aiming  at  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  PRRT  using  177Lu-DOTATOC  in 
therapeutic management of SSTR-positive tumours, mainly NETs for which results are published.  
A summary table was presented with 7 studies aimed to investigate efficacy and safety of PRRT using 
177Lu-DOTATOC in therapeutic management of SSTR-positive tumours, mainly NETs. 
Improvement of symptoms as well as effects on disease progression were observed.  
Effectiveness  and  toxicity  of  radiolabelled  DOTATOC  in  patients  with  metastatic  paraganglioma  and 
pheochromocytoma has been investigated. To that end, patients (n=25) were treated with 200 mCi/m2 
1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 1.0 or 1.1 is a standard way to measure the response of a tumor to 
treatment (E.A. Eisenhauera, 2009)

body surface 90Y-DOTATOC and three patients were treated with cycle with 100 mCi/m2 90Y-DOTATOC 
followed  by  2  cycles  of  200  mCi  177Lu-DOTATOC.  Two  patients  showed  partial  remission,  five  minor 
responses, 13 had stable disease, two showed mixed responses, and six patients remained progressive. 
Time  to  progression  ranged  from  3  to  >  42  months.  The  treatment  was  well  tolerated.  The  authors 
concluded  that  radiolabelled  DOTATOC  may  exert  a  treatment  option  for  surgically  incurable 
paragangliomas because of low toxicity and long-lasting remissions (Forrer F, 2008).  
3. Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA  
During the past years, several clinical studies were conducted investigating the safety and efficacy of 
177Lu-PSMA RLT, mainly using 177Lu-PSMA-617, in the treatment of mCRPC. Fourteen studies and 4 meta-
analyses were. 
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses were published analysing the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-
PSMA RLT in treatment of patients with mCRPC. Yadav and co-workers concluded from their analyses 
that  177Lu-PSMA  RLT  showed  antitumor  activity  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  mCRPC  that  has 
progressed after standard treatment. Due to its low toxicity, 177Lu-PSMA RLT was reported as a potential 
therapeutic  option  for  patients  not  tolerating  docetaxel  therapy  or  who  have  extensive  bone  marrow 
involvement.177Lu-PSMA RLT was shown to reduce PSA levels and lengthen overall and progression-free 
survival with low and transient toxicity (Yadav MP, 2019).  
As for patients with mCRPC, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT and 177Lu-PSMA I&T was reported to 
result in better efficacy and to causefewer adverse effects than third-line treatment with enzalutamide 
and cabazitaxel, which resulted in discontinuation of treatment for 10% to 23% of patients (von Eyben 
FE, 2018). 
4. Efficacy of PSMA-targeting 177Lu-J591 in radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of prostate cancer 
J591 is a monoclonal murine anti-PSMA antibody targeting the extracellular domain of PSMA. Comparable 
with other PSMA-targeting tracer molecules, this antibody can be used to deliver radioisotopes to PCa 
cells. Five studies and 1 meta-analysis were summarised. 
A phase I clinical trial was conducted by Bander and colleagues in 2005. A total of 35 subjects received 
treatment, of whom 16 received up to three doses. A total of 10 mg/m2 of 177Lu-J591 (ranging from 10 
mCi/m2-75  mCi/m2)  were  administered  per  patient.  While  the  majority  of  patients  received  sub-
therapeutic doses in this dose-escalation phase I study, four (11.4%) patients experienced more than a 
50% PSA decline that lasted three to eight months. Additionally, 16 (46 %) subjects experienced PSA 
stabilisation for a median of 60 days (1-21+ months). In this phase I trial acceptable toxicity was also 
reported (Bander NH, 2005).  
The  results  of  a  phase  II  clinical  trial  were  published  in  2013  by  Tagawa  and  co-workers.  The  study 
consisted of two cohorts of patients with mCRPC. The first cohort included 15 patients that received 65 
mCi/m2 177Lu-J591 and the second cohort included 17 patients who received 70 mCi/m2 177Lu-J591. An 
expansion cohort of 15 patients received 70 mCi/m2 to verify the response rate and examine biomarkers. 
Overall,  28  patients  (59.6%)  experienced  a  PSA  decline  with  17  patients  (36.2%)  experiencing  more 
than  30%  decline  in  PSA  following  a  single  dose  of  177Lu-J591.  Twelve  (25.53  %)  patients  had  a 
measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria. (Tagawa ST, 2013).  
Further phase I/II clinical trials as well as pilot studies investigated dose fractionation of 177Lu-J591 as 
potential effort  to  deliver a  greater  cumulative dose  of  177Lu  with less  toxicity.  Fractionation of  177Lu-
J591 allowed for the administration of a greater cumulative dose (and, presumably, absorbed radiation 
dose) and resulted in improved PSA response and overall survival. This dose fractionation concept is also 
being studied with other radiotherapies for PCa, e.g. using 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT, with favourable results 
(Tagawa ST, 2019).

A meta-analysis comprising 10 studies on the efficacy of 177Lu-J591, 177Lu-PSMA-617 or 177Lu-PSMA-I&T 
was  performed  by  Calopedos  and  colleagues  in  2017.  Overall,  the  meta-analysis  showed  that 
approximately two-thirds of patients had a biochemical response (Calopedos RJS, 2017).  
5. Efficacy of 177Lu-EDTMP in treatment of painful bone metastases 
Bone metastases develop in multiple malignancies with a wide range of incidences. Skeletal metastases 
are considered a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 65%-75% of patients with advanced stages 
of breast and prostate cancer, as well as in 15%-30% cases of lung, colon, stomach, bladder, uterus, 
rectum,  thyroid,  and  kidney  malignancies,  deteriorating  quality  of  life  (QoL)  in  all  these  groups  of 
patients. Therefore, many therapeutic options, aiming to improve QoL of patients with metastatic bone 
involvement by pain reduction and prevention of further complications and morbidities have been focus 
of research interest.  
Currently  available  palliative  strategies  include  the  administration  of  conventional  analgesics, 
bisphosphonates,  chemotherapy,  external  beam  radiotherapy,  and  radionuclide  therapy,  showing 
variable degrees of success for bone pain palliation. Among them, radionuclide bone pain palliation is of 
particular interest due to low level of adverse reactions while imposing systemic effects (Askari E, 2020).  
Ethylene  diamine  tetra  methylene  phosphonic  acid  (EDTMP)  forms  stable  complexes  with  various 
radiometals concentrating in the skeleton in proportion to osteoblastic activity (Yuan J, 2013). 
Seven clinical studies and 1 Meta-Analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of  177Lu-EDTMP in the 
treatment of painful bone metastases were summarised. 
In this meta-analysis (Askari E, 2020), treatment efficacy, safety profile, and toxicities of 177Lu-EDTMP 
in patients with metastatic bone involvement was evaluated. Eight studies were included, comprising a 
total of 172 patients. This analysis revealed statistically significant effect of 177Lu-EDTMP therapy on the 
visual analog score (4.84%, 95% CI: 3.88–5.81; p < 0.001), bone palliative pain response (84%, 95% 
CI: 75%–90%; p < 0.001), and Karnofsky performance status (21%, 95% CI: 18%–24%; p < 0.001) 
overall  (as  well  as  in  the  high-dose  and  low-dose  subgroups).  Complete  palliative  pain  response  to 
treatment was observed in 32% (95% CI: 16%–53%) of patients receiving 177Lu-EDTMP. Anaemia was 
found  to  be  the  most  common  hematologic  toxicity  imposed  by  this  therapeutic  approach  (grade  I/II 
anaemia in 24% (95% CI: 14%–38%; p < 0.001) and grade III/IV anaemia in 19% (95% CI: 12%–
28%; p < 0.001)).  The authors concluded that  177Lu-EDTMP seems to have comparable efficacy and 
safety profile as that of the frequently administered radiopharmaceuticals for bone palliation.  
6. Efficacy of 177Lu-labelled antibodies in RIT of other cancers 
Antibody CC49  
CC49 is a murine monoclonal antibody that recognises the tumour-associated glycoprotein 72. An initial 
Phase I study using 177Lu-labelled CC49 in a small number of patients with previously treated advanced 
adenocarcinoma revealed no anti-tumour response (Mulligan T, 1995). 
In another early Phase I study, 12 ovarian cancer patients who failed previous chemotherapy received 
177Lu-CC49 antibody intraperitoneally with >50% of patients showing tumour reduction after therapy. 
The authors concluded that intraperitoneal RIT using 177Lu-CC49 was well tolerated and appeared to be 
efficacious in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity (Meredith RF, 1996).  
A  further  phase  I/II  clinical  trial  of  intraperitoneal  177Lu-CC49  was  conducted  in  27  ovarian  cancer 
patients who failed previous chemotherapy. One of 13 patients with gross disease showed >50% tumour 
reduction after therapy. Seven of 9 patients with 6  to 35 months. Bone marrow suppression was the 
dose-limiting toxic effect. MTD (maximum tolerated dose) was assessed at 1.67 GBq/m2 (Alvarez RD, 
1997).  
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 41/68 
 
 
 
In 2001, Meredith and co-workers investigated the feasibility of combining subcutaneous interferon and 
intraperitoneal Taxol (paclitaxel) with intraperitoneal 177Lu-CC49 in a clinical phase I study. In total, 46 
patients  with  recurrent or  persistent  ovarian  cancer  were  enrolled.  The  MTD  for  177Lu-CC49  was  1.48 
GBq/m2 when given with interferon +100 mg/m2 Taxol. Four of 17 patients with measurable disease had 
a partial response and 4 of 27 patients with non-measurable disease had progression-free intervals of 
18+, 21+, 21+ and 37+ months. The authors concluded that the combination of intraperitoneal Taxol 
with 177Lu-CC49 and interferon was well tolerated, with bone marrow suppression being the dose-limiting 
toxicity (Meredith RF, 2001). In 2012, the same working group analysed data from 92 patients >5 years 
after  intraperitoneal  radionuclide  therapy  with  90Y-  or  177Lu-CC49  to  determine  prognostic  factors.  A 
statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival was noted for less bulky disease and 
younger  age.  Dose  escalation  of  radionuclide  did  not  change  risk  of  progression.  It  was  therefore 
concluded that this therapy may have therapeutic efficacy at modest dose levels (Meredith R, 2012). 
Trastuzumab 
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) is a protein that is over expressed in one fourth 
of the breast cancers. Among the various types of breast cancers, HER2-expressing breast cancers are 
considered to be associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment strategies for those types of breast 
cancer include surgery, radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Trastuzumab is an 
approved humanised monoclonal antibody that targets HER2/neu cancer cells and offers inhibitory effect 
on the growth of these cells. It was routinely used as targeted therapy for the treatment of HER2/neu 
overexpressing breast cancer in combination with other chemotherapy drugs (Bhusari P, 2017).  
A preliminary pilot study was conducted on breast cancer patients (n=6 HER2-positive and n=4 HER-
negative) to evaluate the ability of 177Lu-trastuzumab for HER2-specific tumour targeting. The conjugates 
were efficiently labelled with 177Lu with high radiochemical purity (up to 91%) and specific activity (6-13 
µCi/µg). 177Lu-trastuzumab was stable up to 12 h post-labelling. Studies in patients showed localisation 
of 177Lu-trastuzumab at primary as well as metastatic sites (HER2-positive) in the planar and SPECT/CT 
images.  No  tracer  uptake  was  observed  in  HER2-negative  patients  indicating  specificity  of  177Lu-
trastuzumab.  The  study  showed  that  177Lu-trastuzumab  had  specific  targeting  ability  for  HER2-
expressing lesions and may in future be considered as palliative treatment option in the form of targeted 
radionuclide therapy for disseminated HER2-positive breast cancer (Bhusari P, 2017). 
Antibody cG250 (girentuximab) 
The  chimeric  antibody  cG250  (girentuximab)  is  reactive  with  carbonic  anhydrase  IX,  a  heat  sensitive 
transmembranous glycoprotein which is ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). 
Expression  in  normal  tissues  is  restricted  to  the  gastrointestinal  mucosa  and  gastrointestinal-related 
structures  with  much  lower  expression  levels  than  in  ccRCC.  Patients  with  metastatic  ccRCC  have  a 
dismal  prognosis.  Results  of  a  phase  I  RIT  study  with  177Lu-cG250  in  23  patients  with  progressive 
metastasised ccRCC were published by Stillebroer and colleagues in 2013. Groups of 3 patients received 
177Lu-cG250, starting at a dose level of 1.11 GBq/m2 with dose increments of 0.37 GBq/m2 per group. 
Patients could receive a total of three treatment cycles. The MTD was assessed at 2.405 GBq/m2 because 
higher doses resulted in dose-limiting myelotoxicity. Most patients (74%) demonstrated stable disease 
at 3 months after the first treatment, and 1 patient showed partial response lasting for 9 months. Mean 
growth of target tumour lesions was reduced from 40.4% during the last 3 months before study entry 
to 5.5% at 3 months after the first treatment cycle. It was concluded that RIT with  177Lu-cG250 may 
stabilise previously progressive metastatic ccRCC (Stillebroer AB, 2013). 
Rituximab 
Rituximab,  a  chimeric  anti-human  CD20  monoclonal  antibody  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. A phase I/II study using 177Lu-DOTA-rituximab was conducted in 31 patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 42/68 
 
 
 
B-cell lymphomas. To evaluate the MTD, the dosage of the radiopharmaceutical was adjusted according 
to body surface area. The MTD was assessed at 1.67 GBq/m2. Thrombocytopenia and leucopoenia were 
identified  as  dose-limiting  toxicities.  Clinical  responses  were  observed  at  all  dose  levels  and  for  all 
lymphoma entities with some of the responses showing notable duration. The authors concluded that 
177Lu-DOTA-rituximab treatment is a safe and feasible treatment option for the lymphomas investigated 
(Forrer F, 2013). 
Lilotomab 
Lilotomab is a murine monoclonal antibody against CD37, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of 
mature human B cells. It is under development as a targeted radiopharmaceutical in which lilotomab is 
conjugated to the beta-minus radiation-emitting isotope lutetium-177 by means of a linker called 
satetraxetan, a derivative of DOTA. The resulting medicinal product is called 177Lu-HH1 or lutetium 
(177Lu) lilotomab satetraxetan (trade name Betalutin). Several international clinical studies with 
Betalutin in patients with lymphoma are ongoing, and promising animal and human data have been 
published.  
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In  accordance  with  the  Annex  1  Part  III  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  clinical  information 
generated from clinical studies using the precursor itself is not considered to be relevant in the specific 
case  of  a  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  intended  solely  for  radiolabelling  purposes.  However, 
information  demonstrating  the  clinical  utility  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  when  attached  to 
relevant carrier molecules shall be presented.  
In support of the clinical utility of 177Lu, the applicant performed a bibliographical search and presented 
comprehensive  efficacy  from  published  clinical  trials,  which  have  been  conducted  with  177Lu-labelled 
tracer molecules during the past 20 years. 
Clinical utility is considered demonstrated in treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumours using 
177Lu-labelled somatostatin analogues.   
Moreover, the applicant has presented enough evidence on the clinical utility of 177Lu in the treatment 
of mCRPC based on literature data with 177Lu-PSMA compounds, in particular when used in radioligand 
therapy. Although no 177Lu-PSMA targeting radiopharmaceutical is currently authorised in the EU, 
many patients with mCRPC are treated on a named patient or compassionate use basis. The use of 
177Lu-PSMA radiopharmaceuticals mainly in RLT is also documented in clinical guidelines issued 
recently (Kratochwil C, 2019) and (Mottet N, 2021). 
A recent meta-analysis (Askari E, 2020) reported 177Lu-EDTMP as an effective and safe treatment for 
palliation of metastatic bone pain in patients with prostate or breast cancer. However, this meta-
analysis is considered to have limitations which hamper interpretation of the results. 
The evidence on the clinical utility of 177Lu-labelled antibodies in RIT of other cancers like ovarian 
cancer (antibody CC49), breast cancer (trastuzumab), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (girentuximab), 
B-cell lymphomas (rituximab), lymphoma (lilotomab) is still considered preliminary. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is concluded that there is enough evidence to support the clinical utility of 177Lu coupled to suitable 
carrier molecules in neuroendocrine tumours and prostate cancer. The evidence currently available to 
demonstrate clinical utility of 177Lu in other areas is still limited or experimental.

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
No original clinical safety studies were conducted by the applicant. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Patient exposure information is based on published studies with 177Lu-labelled tracers. 
Numerous clinical studies have investigated the efficacy and/or safety of 177Lu-labelled tracers such as 
SSTR2- or PSMA-targeting molecules for PRRT/RLT of NETs and PCa, respectively. Furthermore, some 
case  reports  could  be  identified  reporting  adverse  events  following  administration  of  177Lu-labelled 
radiotracers, including those reporting safety findings upon accidental administration of lutetium-177. 
Reported  adverse  reactions  associated  with  treatment  using  lutetium-177,  as  well  as  case  reports  on 
accidental  administration  of  lutetium-177  chloride,  are  presented  and  summarised  in  tables,  with  the 
author of the study, posology, key safety findings, number and patients characteristics: 
Annex I- Safety of 177Lu-oxodotreotide: 26 studies and one case report on accidental administration of 
lutetium-177 chloride in 5 patients (Kang KW, 2020) 
Annex II- Safety of 177Lu-DOTATOC: 8 studies. 
Annex III- Safety of 177Lu-PSMA: 17 studies and a case report on accidental oral administration of 177Lu-
PSMA. 
Annex IV- Safety of 177Lu-J591: 5 studies.

The main studies about safety with a specific 177Lu-labelled compound are summarised as follows. 
Safety of 177Lu-oxodotreotide 
During radiotherapy with 177Lu-oxodotreotide, the most common minor side-effects were nausea (max. 
grade 2), asthenia, and mild alopecia in a study published in 2014 (Paganelli G, 2014). In another study 
comprising 468 patients, transient haematological toxicity of grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 was found 
in 8 (1.7%), 1 (0.2%) and 1 patient (0.2%) respectively. Nephrotoxicity of grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, 
and grade 4 were seen in 16 (3.5%), 3 (0.6%), 2 (0.4%) and 1 patient (0.2%) respectively (Sitani K, 
2021).  In  2018,  efficacy  and  safety  of  177Lu-oxodotreotide  PRRT  was  analysed  in  a  large  cohort  with 
NETs. Myelodysplastic syndrome or leukaemia developed in 22 patients (2.1%) and 5 patients required 
haemodialysis after treatment due renal toxicity; other adverse events were found to be rare (Baum RP, 
2018). 
Safety of 177Lu-PSMA 
Grade  3-4  haematotoxicity  mostly  occurred  in  less  than  10%  of  patients,  whilst  the  first  prospective 
phase II trial published in 2018 by Hofman and colleagues reported slightly higher values. Low blood 
count levels at baseline and diffuse bone marrow involvement were linked to serious haematotoxicity in 
individual patients. The rate of grade 3-4 events was low for all other categories, including salivary gland 
function.  A  recent  phase  II  trial  reported  grade  1  dry  mouth  in  87%  patients,  grade  1  or  2  transient 
nausea in 50%, and grade 1 or 2 fatigue in 50% of patients (Hofman MS, 2018). The most common 
toxic effects possibly related to 177Lu-PSMA-617 were grade 3 lymphocytopenia in eleven (37%), grade 
3 anaemia in four (13%), and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in four (13%) patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Dry mouth 
Dry mouth has been reported among patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
receiving PSMA-targeted lutetium (177Lu)-labelled radioligands and has been transient. 
Alopecia 
Alopecia,  described  as  mild  and  temporary,  has  been  observed  among  patients  receiving 
lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. 
Overdose 
Accidental injection of 177Lu chloride solution has been reported from Kang and co-workers (Kang KW, 
2020). Activities of 7.7 to 8.1 GBq of unlabelled lutetium-177 chloride were accidentally injected to five 
patients (1 male and 4 female) with NETs from South Korea at a hospital in Malaysia. Radiation dose to

patients  was  estimated  using  biokinetic  model  of  lutetium  based  on  the  animal  experiments  in  ICRP 
Publication 30. Unfortunately, the accident was only noted the next day when post therapy scans showed 
only bone uptake rather than uptake by tumours. Rapid drop of white blood cell and platelet counts was 
noted.  Even  if  repeated  injections  of  G-CSF  and  platelet  transfusion  were  done,  severe  pancytopenia 
continued for months. Unfortunately, one patient developed fever after 4 weeks and died from mid-brain 
haemorrhage related to disseminated intravascular coagulation at 5 weeks post-accident. One man died 
from disease progression 10 months later (Kang KW, 2020).  
GENERAL SAFETY ASPECTS CONCERNING RADIATION EXPOSURE 
Several  studies  have  been  published  during  the  past  years  investigating  the  occupational  radiation 
exposure of nuclear medicine personnel as well as patients’ household members following administration 
of 177Lu-labelled tracers for targeted tumour radiotherapy [ (Abuqbeitah M, 2018)see Dosimetry of 177Lu-
labelled tracers in the Clinical Pharmacology section]. Additional studies are summarised hereafter. 
In  2016,  Demir  and  colleagues  investigated  the  outpatient treatment  protocol  and  radiation  safety  of 
177Lu-PSMA-617. The authors analysed the dose rate of 23 patients treated with 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-
617 at different distances (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 2.0 m) and different time points (0, 1, 2, 4, 18, 24, 
48 and 120 h) after the termination of infusion. The mean dose rate at 1 m after 4 h and 6 h was 23±6 
μSv/h and 15±4 μSv/h respectively. The mean total dose to 23 caregivers was 202.3±42.7 μSv (range: 
120-265  μSv).  The  radiation  doses  of  the  nurse  and  radiopharmacist  were  6  and  4  μSv  per  patient, 
respectively, whereas the doses of the physicist and physician were 2μSv. The study showed that 177Lu-
PSMA-617 was a safe treatment modality to be applied as an outpatient protocol, since the dose rate 
decreased below the determined threshold of <30 μSv/h after approximately 5 h and was further reduced 
to 20 μSv/h after 6 h. (Demir M, 2016) 
Exposure during radiolabelling was investigated by Arora and co-workers in 2017. The mean radiation 
doses  recorded  during  labelling  were  found  to  be  0.023±0.01  mSv  for  177Lu-oxodotreotide/NOC, 
0.01±0.002 mSv for 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 0.002±0.0006 mSv for 177Lu-EDTMP and the mean duration 
of labelling was 0.81, 0.65, and 0.58 h, respectively. The specific activity of 177Lu was ~19-22 mCi/μg in 
all labelling procedures. The mean estimated radiation dose rate during the three labelling procedures 
was  0.03±0.01  mSv/h  for  177Lu-oxodotreotide/NOC,  0.01±0.003  mSv/h  for  177Lu-PSMA-617,  and 
0.003±0.001 mSv/h for  177Lu-EDTMP. Overall, mean radiation dose was 0.014 mSv and duration was 
0.72 h (Arora G, 2017). 
In 2018, radiation exposure to the public caused by administration of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was investigated 
by Kurth and co-workers. To that end, whole-body dose rates were measured at a distance of 2 m at 
various time points after application of 6.3 ± 0.5 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617. Unbound 177Lu-PSMA-617 was 
found to be rapidly cleared from the body. After 4 h, approximately 50%, and after 12 h, approximately 
70% of the administered activity were excreted, primarily via urine. The maximum dose to individual 
members of the public per treatment cycle was ~ 250±55 μSv when the patient was discharged from 
the clinic after 48 h and ~190±36 μSv when the patient was discharged after 72 h (Kurth J, 2018). 
A  further  study  was  published  in  2018  as  well  investigating  the  radiation  exposure  after  177Lu-
oxodotreotide and 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. The authors found that radioactivity incorporated in patients 
treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 ligand seems to be eliminated from the body more slowly than in patients 
receiving 177Lu-oxodotreotide. However, the inter-patient variation for 177Lu-PSMA-617 was considered 
too large to provide a standardised and clinically reasonable discharge procedure. The tumour load of 
patients suffering from PCa varied considerably depending on the stage of the disease as  well as the 
time radiotherapy was initialised.  
Assessment report

Levart and co-workers reported mean dose-rates (in μSv/h) of 15.0 (5.0-25.0) at 1 m distance from the 
patient receiving therapy, comparable with those reported by Sulieman and colleagues, showing a mean 
dose rate (in μSv /h) at the same distance of 16.2 (8.0-23.0) (Levart D, 2019).  
In 2020, Sulieman and colleagues reported decreased dose rates at 3 m compared to 0.3 m. With use 
of a bedside shield, the dose was found to drop below 0.1 μSv/h at 2 m distance (Sulieman A, 2020). 
Results of a further study investigating the radiation exposure upon administration of 177Lu-oxodotreotide 
were  published  in  2019  by  Nelson  and  Sheetz.  Data  from  a  total of  77  treatment  cycles involving 26 
individual patients were analysed. Patient exposure upon release was found to be around 10 μGy h-1 at 
1 m, after patients had eliminated approximately 50% of the administered dose. The authors concluded 
that radiotherapy with 177-lu oxodotreotide could be an outpatient procedure that could be performed 
safely in any hospital procedural room without the need for additional shielding (Nelson KL, 2019). 
In  2019,  a  case  was  reported  of  radiation  contamination  following  cremation  of  a  deceased  patient 
treated with 193.6 mCi of intravenous 177Lu-oxodotreotide. The patient died from the underlying disease 
2 days after treatment and was cremated 5 days post-treatment. Crematory equipment demonstrated 
a range of 5,000 to 25,000 counts per minute with a 7.5-mR maximum exposure rate per hour on direct 
contact with the Geiger-Mueller detector. The personal radiation detector identified that radioactivity was 
primarily from 177Lu. Given the short range (1.5 mm) and half-life (approximately 6.7 days) of 177Lu, the 
total effective dose equivalent annual limit of 1 mSv for members of the public was unlikely to have been 
exceeded (Yu NY, 2019).

Pregnant and lactating women  
According  to  the  SmPCs  of  authorised  medicinal  products  containing  lutetium-177,  those  medicinal 
products  are  contraindicated  in  established  or  suspected  pregnancy  or  when  pregnancy  has  not  been 
excluded. 
Paediatric population  
The proposed medicinal product is not intended for use in children and adolescents. As medicinal products 
containing 177Lu are currently not authorised for use in the paediatric population, data on the safety of 
177Lu-labelled tracers in this vulnerable population are scarce. 
Elderly  
Due to the nature of the underlying diseases, a significant number of patients above the age of 65 years 
have been treated with 177Lu-labelled tracers in the course of published clinical studies.  
In a retrospective study, Leibowitz and co-workers evaluated the safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in 
patients below and above the age of 75 years. The authors found that fatigue was more prevalent in 
Assessment report

the elderly patients compared with the younger patient cohort. The frequency of anaemia was also 
numerically higher in the elderly patients. The authors concluded that there were no new safety signals 
in elderly patients and that the safety profile observed in patients >75 years can be considered 
comparable to patients <75 years of age (Leibowitz R, 2020). 
Renal impairment  
Radiolabelled  peptides  are  mainly  excreted  by  the  kidney.  Radiation  nephropathy  has  been  reported 
following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using radioisotopes. 
A study published in 2016 by Ranade and Basu retrospectively investigated the renal toxicity profile of 
177Lu-oxodotreotide PRRT in patients with metastatic NET and a single functioning kidney. Six patients 
received between 3 and 5 cycles of therapy with a cumulative activity of 16.6-36.2 GBq. The duration of 
follow-up ranged from 12 to 56 months. The overall toxicity profile (as per the NCI-CTCAE score) showed 
no acute renal toxicity in any patient. Regarding overall chronic renal toxicity, 3 patients had none, 1 
patient had grade II, and 2 patients had grade I. All patients with overall chronic renal toxicity showed 
compromised renal function at the outset (baseline). The 2 patients with grade I chronic renal toxicity 
after PRRT had grade II at baseline and gradual improvement over the subsequent cycles. One patient 
with grade II at baseline showed transient worsening to grade III after the first cycle followed by gradual 
improvement and a return to baseline after the second cycle. Only 2 patients showed a reduction in GFR 
(5.3% in one and 13.84% in the other). Four patients showed a reduction in effective renal plasma flow, 
ERPF (31.4% in the patient with the greatest reduction), and all had a rise in filtration fraction signifying 
that tubular parameters were more affected than glomerular parameters. The authors concluded that 3-
5 cycles of 177Lu-oxodotreotide PRRT can be applied to patients with NET and a single functioning kidney, 
when administered along with renal protection and dose fractionation (Ranade R, 2016)

Update Single Assessments (PSUSAs) (refer to section on “adverse events”). 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In accordance with the Annex 1 Part III of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, in the specific case of a 
radiopharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radiolabelling purposes, the primary objective shall 
be to present information which would address the possible consequences of poor radiolabelling 
efficiency or in vivo dissociation of the radiolabelled conjugate, i.e. questions related to the effects 
produced in the patient by free radionuclide. These aspects have been adequately addressed in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022

Dosimetry of 177Lu chloride section (above), focusing on the accumulation of free lutetium-177 
(177Lu3+) in target organs (osteogenic cells). Furthermore, safety information from already authorised 
medicinal products containing the active substance lutetium (177Lu) chloride was evaluated, including a 
query in EudraVigilance. After evaluation of all public sources, 189 references were included in the 
clinical overview presented by the applicant. 
In general, adverse reactions following the administration of a 177Lu-labelled medicinal product 
prepared by radiolabelling with the proposed medicinal product will be mainly dependent on the 
specific medicinal product being used. Such information will be supplied in the SmPC/package leaflet of 
the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  
Exposure to ionising radiation is known to induce cancer and is potentially mutagenic. The radiation 
dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. As a 
general rule, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are lower than from the disease 
itself and therefore, the radiation exposure by treatment with 177Lu labelled tracers should be always 
carefully considered. 
The presence of free 177Lu chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of the lutetium 
(177Lu) chloride proposed medicinal product can be considered to result in increased bone marrow 
toxicity and haematopoietic stem cell damage. Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of 
ilLuzyce, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i.e. within 1 hour) 
administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the 
elimination of the radionuclide from the body. The following preparations must be available in medical 
institutions, which use ilLuzyce for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: Ca-DTPA 
(trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or Ca-EDTA (calcium disodium 
ethylenediaminetetraacetate).  
These chelating agents help with the elimination of lutetium (177Lu) radiotoxicity by an exchange 
between the calcium ion in the complex and the lutetium (177Lu) ion. Due to the capacity of the 
chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound lutetium 
(177Lu) are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. One gram of the chelating agents should be administered 
by slow intravenous injection over 3 – 4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 – 250 mL of glucose, or 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection). The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately 
or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and 
plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does not preclude the administration and effective 
action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous administration should not be protracted over 
more than 2 hours. In any case, the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the 
appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of radiotoxicity. The toxicity of free lutetium 
(177Lu) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be 
reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. 
Although no dedicated carcinogenicity studies were submitted, the potential risk for osteosarcoma was 
described in rats after 12 months of exposure to lutetium 177 (estimated dose 2000-8000 rd, 20-80 
Gy). It was comparable to the effect of the radiation from exposure to strontium-90. See 2.5.4.4.  
Carcinogenicity in the form of osteosarcomas has been included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP and instructions to handle the risk have been included in the SmPC as instructions to prepare 
radiopharmaceuticals: Free lutetium (177Lu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could 
potentially result in osteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to 
intravenous administration of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled conjugates in order to form a complex with 
free lutetium (177Lu), if present, leading to a rapid renal clearance of lutetium (177Lu). 
Due to the myelosuppressive effect of 177Lu-labelled tracers as frequently reported in PRRT and RLT, 
concomitant chemotherapy and treatment with radioactive bone seekers can be considered critical as 
Assessment report

additive effects may occur. Therefore, current guidelines recommend discontinuing the treatment with 
those medicinal products for at least four weeks during radiotherapy with 177Lu-labelled tracers 
(Kratochwil C, 2019). 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been observed after 
treatment with lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours 
(see section 4.8). This Recommendation to take this should be taken into account when considering 
the benefit/risk, especially in patients with possible risk factors like prior exposure to chemotherapeutic 
agents (such as alkylating agents) has been included in the SmPC. Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, 
leucopenia, lymphopenia, and less commonly neutropenia may occur during radioligand therapy with 
lutetium (177Lu). Most events are mild and transient, but in some cases patients have required blood 
and platelet transfusions. In some patients more than one cell line may be affected and pancytopenia 
requiring treatment discontinuation has been described. A blood count should be taken at baseline and 
monitored regularly during treatment, in accordance with clinical guidance.  
Radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been 
reported following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other 
radioisotopes. Renal function should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and renal protection 
should be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance. Generally, careful consideration of the 
benefit-risk-ratio is deemed required in these patients due to potentially increased renal radiation 
exposure as shown in clinical studies. It was shown that patients with inferior renal function also 
experienced higher grades of haematotoxicity during treatment (p=0.01) (Svensson J, 2015). 
Individual radiation dosimetry assessments of specific organs which may not be the target organ of 
therapy might be of relevance. It is advisable to assess renal function at baseline and during 
treatment. This is also in line with recommendations given in the SmPCs of already authorised 
medicinal products containing the radionuclide lutetium-177. Furthermore, renal protection should be 
considered according to the SmPC of the medicinal product intended for labelling with lutetium-177. In 
order to prevent nephrotoxicity secondary to treatment of NETs with 177Lu-oxodotreotide, co-infusion 
of amino acids is administered resulting in decreased tubular renal reabsorption of the radiolabelled 
peptide.   
Altogether, radiation exposure of radiopharmacists during labelling and exposure of medical personnel 
during treatment as well as of the general public was found to be acceptable and within the limits as 
defined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). However, radiation 
exposure varies between patients and different radiopharmaceuticals and therefore, additional 
inpatient and outpatient regulations should be taken into account as well. Considering the Table 8 and 
Table 9 data presented under Dosimetry, an accidental injection of 2GBq (177Lu)LuCl3 (each 5 ml vial 
delivered contains an activity ranging from 5.2 to 207.2 GBq at activity reference time (ART) in a 
volume of 0.1 to 4 ml), would be a total effective dose of 0.244 Sv for a male adult and 0.264 Sv for a 
female adult (associated with first clinical signs of radiation toxicity, such as nausea and fatigue 
(U.S.EPA., 2020)), while in a five-year-old and lower, would cause severe radiation toxicity. From the 
dosimetry tables it is clear that even the lowest dose contained in one vial, if administered 
accidentally, would result in radiation toxicity to individual organs. 
Procedural guidelines for the management of radiotherapy, including regulations on patients’ 
discharge, have been developed and should be strictly followed to avoid unnecessary radiation 
exposure. Information related to occupational hazards and radiation exposure to hospital staff and to 
the environment is properly addressed and captured in the product information for ilLuzyce (see 
sections 4.4, 6.6 and 12 of the SmPC).  
Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an 
ionisation chamber. Lutetium (177Lu) is a beta(-)/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an 
Assessment report

ionization chamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only 
under geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated. Usual precautions regarding 
sterility and radioactivity should be respected. Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic 
conditions. The vials must not be opened before disinfecting the stopper, the solution should be 
withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe fitted with suitable protective shielding and a 
disposable sterile needle or using an authorised automated application system. If the integrity of this 
vial is compromised, the medicinal product should not be used. The complexing agent and other 
reagents should be added to the vial with lutetium (177Lu) chloride. Adequate quality control of the 
radiochemical purity of ready to use radiopharmaceuticals gained after radiolabelling with ilLuzyce 
should be assured. Limits for radiochemical impurities should be set recognising the radiotoxicological 
potential of lutetium (177Lu). Free non-bound lutetium (177Lu) should be consequently minimised. 
After therapy with 177Lu-labelled peptides, haematological toxicity, myelodysplastic syndrome, renal 
toxicity and liver toxicity have been reported. Haematotoxicity and dry mouth have been reported with 
177Lu-labelled PSMA-ligands in radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
In patients with protaste cancer, Tagawa et al. described myelosuppression was the most prominent 
toxicity with 22 (47%) patients developing grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Nearly all patients (97.9%) 
reported a complete recovery in platelet count. Overall, 177Lu-J591 was well-tolerated with reversible 
myelosuppression (Tagawa ST, 2013). 
Beside the numerous publications where the safety profile has been well established, clinical guidelines 
regarding efficacy and safety of medicinal products containing lutetium-177 have been recently issued 
(Zaknun JJ, 2013) (Kratochwil C, 2019) and (Mottet N, 2021). 
Furthermore, post-marketing experience, information from Periodic Safety Update Single Assessments 
and PRAC scientific conclusions from the approved medicinal products containing lutetium-177 have 
depicted a well-known safety profile for these medicinal products and the product information (PI) has 
been updated accordingly. 
Information on adverse events reported to the EudraVigilance database (by 27/03/2021) during 177Lu 
PRRT by age group has been presented by the applicant. Unfortunately, the patients’ age was not 
reported for all cases. From the information available, it cannot be concluded that highly frequent 
adverse reactions, e.g., those concerning the blood and lymphatic system, are significantly more 
pronounced in patients above 65 years of age (elderly). However, as elderly patients are considered to 
be more vulnerable to immunosuppression, the risk of significant haematotoxicity due to radiotherapy 
should be taken into consideration in this special population. 
A case of cardiomyopathy was described upon administration of 177Lu-oxodotreotide in a patient with 
cardiac metastases. Caution was advised in those patients who may be receiving PRRT, and cardiac 
evaluation before and after therapy was recommended (Hendifar AE, 2018). However, more data are 
deemed required to assess this particular risk factor accordingly. 
Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the post-marketing setting and in the literature in 
patients with liver metastases undergoing treatment with 177Lu-PRRT for NETs. Liver function should be 
monitored regularly during treatment. Dose reduction may be necessary in affected patients. Before 
each administration and during the treatment, biological tests are required to re-assess the patient’s 
condition and adapt the therapeutic protocol if necessary.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed medicinal product ilLuzyce (lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a) is a radiopharmaceutical 
precursor not intended for direct use in patients. It is to be used only for radiolabelling of carrier 
molecules that have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are other available therapies based on Lutetium-177, but due to its radioactive characteristics 
(decay), granting a new marketing authorisation would improve the availability of these therapies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In  line  with  the  Annex  1  Part  III  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  on  radiopharmaceutical 
precursors,  relevant  information  on  the  clinical  utility  of  the  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  Lutetium 
(177Lu) chloride when is attached to appropriate carrier molecules has been provided. 
An appropriate number of published articles and meta-analyses have been presented documenting a 
well established use of 177Lu-tracer-complex, mainly in neuroendocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic 
tumours and in prostate cancer.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Clinical  utility  has  been  shown  in  the  treatment of  patients  with  neuroendocrine  tumours  using  177Lu-
labelled  somatostatin  analogues.  In  this  regard,  the  use  of  177Lu-oxodotreotide  for  the  treatment  of 
unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive 
GEP-NETs in adults, is considered established, as 177Lu-oxodotreotide is already authorised in this clinical 
setting. 
Moreover, there is sufficient evidence to support clinical utility of lutetium (177Lu) chloride when 
coupled to a carrier molecule in the treatment of mCRPC based on available efficacy data on 177Lu-
PSMA compounds, in particular in Radioligand therapy RLT supported with the most robust data.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The applicant has presented evidence on efficacy and safety of 177Lu-EDTMP on bone pain in patients 
with breast and prostate cancer and of 177Lu-labelled antibodies in radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of other 
cancers like ovarian cancer (antibody CC49), breast cancer (trastuzumab), clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma (girentuximab), B-cell lymphomas (rituximab), lymphoma (lilotomab). The evidence 
currently available to demonstrate clinical utility of 177Lu in these areas is still limited or experimental. 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 60/68 
 
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects are mainly related to the radioactivity of 177Lu. Exposure to ionising radiation is 
known to induce cancer and is potentially mutagenic.  
After therapy with 177Lu-labelled peptides, haematological toxicity, myelodysplastic syndrome, renal 
toxicity and liver toxicity have been reported. Haematotoxicity and dry mouth have been reported with 
177Lu-labelled PSMA-ligands in radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Decreased blood cell count (anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, 
pancytopenia) and Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia as well Radiation effects on 
persons who are unaware of the exposure when in close vicinity of the patient are included in the 
RMP as important identified risks. In addition, osteosarcoma, radiation nephropathy and radiation-
induced hepatotoxicity are considered as important potential risks in the RMP. Moreover, 
corresponding special warnings and precautions for use are included in the SmPC accordingly.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects will depend on the specific 177Lu-labelled medicinal product prepared by 
radiolabelling with the proposed medicinal product. After administration of 177Lu-labelled medicinal 
product, in-vivo release of free lutetium (177Lu3+) from the labelled biomolecule could occur. The 
degree of in-vivo release and free lutetium (177Lu3+) toxicity are unclear. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Lutetium  (177Lu)  chloride  is  a  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  intended  to  be  used  for  radiolabelling  of 
suitable carrier molecules (peptides, antibodies) which have been specifically developed and authorised 
for radiolabelling with lutetium-177. Therefore, clinical utility must be demonstrated. As required, the 
applicant has reviewed the literature in order to document the clinical utility of lutetium-177.  
When coupled to a carrier molecule, clinical utility of 177Lu in neuroendocrine tumours and prostate 
cancer has been demonstrated. The use of 177Lu-labelled somatostatin analogues in treatment of 
patients with neuroendocrine tumours has been consolidated after having been granted with a 
marketing authorisation in the EU.  
Unfavourable effects are mainly related to the radioactivity of 177Lu. Adverse reactions following the 
administration of a 177Lu-labelled medicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with the proposed 
medicinal product will be mainly dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. Therapy with 
these medicinal products is well tolerated and toxicity is manageable if protective recommendations 
and dose limits are followed, which have been adequately reflected in the product information.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The proposed medicine is a radiopharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radiolabelling purposes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/689220/2022  
Page 61/68 
 
 
 
The clinical utility of 177Lu has been demonstrated and is considered to outweigh the risks associated 
with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride.  
The benefits and risks of 177Lu-labelled medicinal product(s) will depend on the specific 177Lu-labelled 
medicinal product(s) in the intended indications and therefore be evaluated independently. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of ilLuzyce is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of ilLuzyce is favourable in the following indication(s): 
ilLuzyce (lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a.) is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and it is not intended for 
direct use in patients. It is to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules that have been 
specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

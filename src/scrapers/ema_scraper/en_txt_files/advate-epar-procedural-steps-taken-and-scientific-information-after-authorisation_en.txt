A non-interventional prospective registry (PASS-INT-004) 
new data on immune tolerance induction (ITI). This 
update follows final results from study PASS-INT-
004; this was a prospective, multi-centre, 
uncontrolled, open-label, non-interventional post-
authorization safety surveillance study conducted to 
documented immune tolerance induction (ITI) in 44 
paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed ITI 
therapy. The data showed that immune tolerance may be 
achieved.

paediatric subjects below 2 years of age. This update

category 3 study in the RMP; this was a prospective, 
non-interventional, post-marketing surveillance 
study that assessed the safety and efficacy of Advate 
reconstituted in 2 ml of sterile water for injection 
during routine clinical practice in the EU. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 15.1 has also been submitted.

ml in children. No new safety signals were identified. 
Advate 2 ml was well tolerated in patients <12 years old, 
none of the adverse events were considered related by the 
investigators. No FVIII inhibitor development was 
observed. No differences between the <2 years age group 
and subjects >2 and <12 years of age was determined with 
regard to safety and treatment efficacy.

Please refer to the assessment report: human coagulation 
Germany initiated a procedure on 6 July 2016 based 
on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data 
from pharmacovigilance activities. 
The PRAC was requested to assess the potential 
impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which 
concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines 
had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than 
plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a 
recommendation as to whether the marketing 
authorisations of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.  The EMA 
factor VIII - EMEA/H/A-31/1448 
Page 9/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear 
and consistent evidence of a difference in the 
incidence of inhibitor development between the two 
classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from 
plasma and those made by recombinant DNA 
technology. Due to the different characteristics of 
individual products within the two classes, EMA 
concluded that the risk of inhibitor development 
should be evaluated individually for each medicine, 
regardless of class. The risk for each product will 
continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes 
available.

Labelling and 
coagulation Factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA 
PL 
technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and belongs to 
the pharmacotherapeutic group of blood coagulation Factor 
VIII (ATC code: B02BD02). It was first approved in the EU 
in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 
with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) on 02 
March 2004 and renewed on 26 February 2009. This is the 
2nd renewal of the Marketing Authorisation for Advate. An 
overview of the knowledge and information submitted 
related to the quality, safety and efficacy aspects of the 
product reconfirmed the positive benefit- risk ration in the 
approved indication. The risk management plan is in place 
and is considered acceptable. The CHMP considers that the 
renewal can be granted with unlimited validity.

Introduction 
Labelling and 
In this variation the MAH presented additional data from a 
PL 
phase 2/3 study (protocol 060101) on pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity, efficacy and safety in the use of Advate in 
previously treated paediatric patients (PTPs) with 
haemophilia A. 
Based on the data analysed the MAH sought an extension 
of the existing clinical indication to include children under 
the age of 6 and proposed to delete the following sentence 
"Currently there are insufficient data in children less than 6 
years of age to recommend the use of ADVATE." in section 
4.2 of the SPC and corresponding changes in the PL. 
Further, the MAH proposed to amend sections 4.8 and 5.2 
of the SPC. Consequential changes have been introduced in 
the PL. The MAH also took this opportunity to bring Annex 
III in line with the latest QRD template.  
Description of study 060101 
This is an ongoing, multi-centre, open-label, prospective, 
uncontrolled clinical study of at least 50 paediatric PTPs 
under 6 years of age with severe or moderately severe 
haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII = 2%).  
The overall study consists of 2 parts:

- 
Part 1 is an open-label evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics and short-term safety of Advate following 
a single dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg body weight;  
- 
Part 2 is an open-label determination of the 
immunogenicity, haemostatic efficacy, and safety of 
Advate. Subjects are to continue to receive Advate for at 
least 50 exposure days or a total treatment time of 6 
months, whichever comes first. The treatment regimen is 
determined by the site investigator (i.e., standard 
prophylaxis [25 to 50 IU/kg, 3 to 4 times per week], 
modified prophylaxis, or on-demand treatment).  
Results and discussion 
Over the 18-month period covered by the interim report, 
53 paediatric PTPs < 6 years of age were given a single 
infusion of Advate in Part 1 of this study for the 
determination of pharmacokinetic and safety data 
parameters. Forty of these subjects have been seen for at 
least one interval stud

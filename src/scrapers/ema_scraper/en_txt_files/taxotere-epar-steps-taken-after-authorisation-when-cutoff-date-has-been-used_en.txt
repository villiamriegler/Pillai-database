On  4  April  1996  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  an  application  for  a  Type  II 
variation to amend the section related to instruction for preparation of Taxotere and to update 
the safety information in the SPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet. The CPMP, during its May 
plenary meeting, adopted a list of questions. The company submitted the full responses to the 
CPMP list of questions on 6 June 1996. The CPMP, during its June plenary meeting, agreed on 
the amended text to be introduced into the SPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet and adopted a 
positive Opinion for the Type II variation. The Commission Decision for the Type II variation 
was issued on 7 October 1996. 
On 30 October 1996 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type I 
variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 relating to the addition 
of  an  alternative-manufacturing  site  of  docetaxel  bulk  solution.  The  EMEA  approved  the 
variation  on  6  December  1996.  This  variation  did  not  require  any  amendments  to  the 
Commission Decision.  
According to the specific obligation (quality) set out in the CPMP Opinion dated 12 July 1995; 
the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  was  requested  to  tighten  the  impurities  specifications  at 
shelf life. The proposed changes, including as a consequence the update of the test procedures 
of  the  finished  medicinal  product,  agreed  by  the  CPMP  during  its  December  plenary  meeting 
were  introduced  through  two  Type  I  variations.  These  applications  were  submitted  on 
27 November 1996.  The  EMEA  approved  on  23  December  1996  both  variations,  which  were 
considered  as  consequential.  Both  variations  did  not  require  any  amendments  to  the 
Commission Decision. 
On  4  December  1996  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  two  applications  for  a 
Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95. The scope of the 
first variation related to the change of the name of the  manufacturer of the finished medicinal 
product and responsible for the batch release from May & Baker Ltd to Rhône-Poulenc Rorer. 
The  second  variation  related  to  the  change  of  the  name  of  the  manufacturer  of  the  active 
substance, docetaxel, and docetaxel solution in polysorbate from Rhône-Poulenc Rorer S.A. to 
Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Principe Actifs. On 12 December 1996 the EMEA approved the variation. 
Only the first variation required amendments to be incorporated in the relevant sections of the 
Commission Decision. The European Commission amended the Decision on 3 March 1997. 
On 25 February 1997 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type I 
variation  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  relating  to  the 
modification  in  the  SPC  and  Package  Leaflet  of  the  shelf  life  of  the  premix  (i.e.  10-mg/ml 
docetaxel solutions) and of the medicinal product after reconstitution. The EMEA approved the 
variation  on  2  April  1997,  which  required  amendments  to  be  incorporated  in  the  relevant 
sections  of  the  Commission  Decision.  The  European  Commission  amended  the  Decision  on 
13 June 1997. 
Pursuant  to  Article  13(2)  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No  2309/93  and  Part  4G  of  Annex  to 
Council Directive 75/318/EEC, the Marketing Authorisation Holder provided throughout 1996 
the  preliminary  reports  of  ongoing  clinical  studies  which  formed  the  basis  of  the  annual  re-
assessment  of  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Taxotere  (e.g.  clinical  studies  with  Taxotere  in 
monotherapy and in combination therapy, studies concerning the management of side-effects). 
On  8  November  1996  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  provided  an  updated  expert  report 
summarising  the  different  specific  obligations  already  submitted  within  the  period  November 
1995  -  November  1996.  The  procedure  started  on  25  November  1996.  During  its  December 
plenary  meeting,  the  CPMP  agreed  with  the  Rapporteur’s  assessment  report  circulated  on 
3 December 1996 that the benefit/risk profile for Taxotere remained unchanged on the basis of 
the  additional  preliminary  efficacy  and  safety  data  provided  and  that  the  Marketing 
Authorisation  should  therefore  remain  under  exceptional  circumstances.  The  CPMP  agreed,

On  21  April  1997  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  an  application  for  a  Type  II 
variation to update the safety section (addition of new undesirable effects) and the posology and 
method  of  administration  section  (fluid  retention  premedication  regimen)  of  the  Summary  of 
Product  Characteristics  and  consequently  the  Package  Leaflet,  based  on  post-marketing 
experience  and  new  clinical  data.  The  CPMP,  during  its  July  plenary  meeting,  considered  the 
changes acceptable, and issued on 23 July 1997 a favourable Opinion on the Type II variation. 
This Opinion was forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European 
Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decision on 10 November 1997.  
On 24 October 1997 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type II 
variation  for  a  change  in  the  formulation  of  Taxotere.  The  CPMP,  during  its  January  plenary 
meeting,  considered  the  changes  acceptable,  and  issued  on  28  January  1998  a  favourable 
Opinion on the Type II variation. This Opinion was forwarded, in all official languages of the 
European Union, to the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decision on 
9 June 1998.  
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  to  the  EMEA  on  28  November  1997  the 
documentation that formed the basis for the annual re-assessment of the benefit/risk profile for 
Taxotere.  During  its  March  1998  plenary  meeting,  the  CPMP  agreed  with  the  Rapporteur’s 
assessment  report  and  adopted  an  Opinion  on  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the  specific 
obligations  and  the  benefit/risk  ratio,  stating  that  no  amendments  of  Annexes  I  and  III  to  the 
Community  Marketing  Authorisation  are  necessary  as  part  of  the  annual  re-assessment. 
Furthermore the CPMP agreed that the Marketing Authorisation Holder fulfilled all the specific 
obligations  as  listed  in  Annex  II  C  to  the  original  Commission  Decision.  The  European 
Commission adopted the corresponding Decision on 7 July 1998. Therefore, the evaluation of 
the benefit/risk ratio has now been completed, and the conditional approval period has come to 
an end: the Annex II C has been modified accordingly. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  to  the  EMEA  on  8  December  1997  an 
application  for  a  Type  II  variation  for  a  broadening  of  the  indication.  The  CPMP,  during  its 
March  plenary  meeting,  considered  the  changes  acceptable  and  issued  on  25  March  1998  a 
favourable  Opinion  on  the  Type  II  variation.  This  Opinion  was  forwarded,  in  all  official 
languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the  European  Commission,  which  adopted  the 
corresponding Decision on 17 July 1998.  
On 12 March 1998 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type II 
variation in order to update the safety section of the SPC following a request of the CPMP after 
evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Report number 4 (addition of new undesirable effects and 
changes in the wording). The CPMP, during its May plenary meeting, considered the changes 
acceptable,  and  issued  on  27  May  1998  a  favourable  Opinion  on  the  Type  II  variation.  This 
Opinion  was  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the  European 
Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decision on 18 September 1998. 
Pursuant to article 10(3) of Council Directive No. 92/27/EEC of 31 March 1992, the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder notified the EMEA on 3 June 1998 of their intention to introduce a change 
to  an  aspect  of  the  labelling  not  connected  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics 
(introduction  of the text “New storage  conditions”).  On  12  June  1998 the  EMEA has notified 
the European Commission that the changes were accepted. The European Commission amended 
the Decision on 5 August 1998. 
On 3 December 1998 the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type 
II variation in order to update the safety section of the SPC following a request of the CPMP 
after evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Report number 5 (addition of new undesirable effects 
and changes in the wording). The CPMP, during its February 1999 plenary meeting, considered 
the changes acceptable, and  issued on 25  February  1999 a  favourable  Opinion on  the  Type II

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the 
/202104 
empagliflozin, empagliflozin / metformin 
PSUR(s) for empagliflozin, empagliflozin / metformin, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on tubulointerstitial nephritis from 
the literature and spontaneous reports highly suggestive of 
Page 7/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
causality association including a close temporal relationship 
and a positive dechallenge, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between empagliflozin, 
empagliflozin/metformin and tubulointerstitial nephritis is 
at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that 
the product information of products containing 
empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin should be amended 
accordingly. 
In view of available data on the drug-drug interaction 
between empagliflozin and lithium from clinical trials and 
the literature suggestive for causal association, including in 
some cases a close temporal relationship and positive 
dechallenge/rechallenge and in view of a plausible 
mechanism of interaction, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between empagliflozin, empagliflozin / 
metformin and drug-drug interaction with lithium is at least 
a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the 
product information of products containing empagliflozin, 
empagliflozin / metformin should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by 
the PRAC.

mostly affecting the toes, observed in an ongoing 
clinical trial (CANVAS) for canagliflozin and a 
numerical imbalance with regards to amputation 
events seen in an ongoing renal study CANVAS-R 
with a similar population as CANVAS. 
Considering that a class effect cannot be excluded, 
the European Commission extended on 6 July 2016 
the scope of the procedure to include all SGLT2 
inhibitors containing medicinal products to allow a 
review of data from the class.  
The PRAC was requested to assess the impact 
thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Invokana, 
Vokanamet, Forxiga, Edistride, Xigduo, Ebymect, 
Jardiance and Synjardy and to give its 
recommendation whether the marketing
